33806456,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=643417,1726875050,"Grayscale XRP Trust Surges 11.44% One Week After Launch, Here’s The Catalyst","Grayscale’s XRP trust has grown noticeably since launch, a development which spells positive momentum for the digital asset. As one of the leading cryptocurrency asset managers in the world, Grayscale’s decision to unveil the first XRP trust in the US last week signaled the beginning of an institutional influx of funds into the cryptocurrency. Since its debut, the Grayscale XRP Trust has performed remarkably well. Data indicates that the trust’s value has surged by 11.44%, a clear indication of strong demand from institutional investors. Value Of Grayscale XRP Trust Rallies Grayscale’s XRP trust tracks the price of the altcoin, and investors buy shares of the trust to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency. When talking about the momentum building behind Grayscale’s XRP trust, we are looking at its Net Asset Value (NAV). The NAV is a measure of the value of each share in the trust and is calculated after every business day. A rising NAV is an indicator of increased institutional investment in the trust. As such, an increase in the NAV relates to a bullish sentiment among traders and the spot price of XRP. Related Reading: Here’s Why A Green September Close Is Important For The Bitcoin Price According to the manager’s website, NAV for the XRP trust currently stands at $11.79, which translates to an increase of slightly above 11.4% in just one week after launch. This impressive rise is not a result of chance but rather the outcome of several positive developments within the broader XRP ecosystem, which work together to signal the continuation of positive momentum. What Is Driving The Momentum? One of the primary drivers behind this bullish momentum is the highly anticipated launch of Ripple’s USD stablecoin, RUSD. The upcoming stablecoin has generated considerable excitement in the cryptocurrency community, as it is expected to play a pivotal role in enhancing liquidity and cross-border payment solutions. The stablecoin is set to debut before the end of the year, but institutional investors are cautiously awaiting further regulatory clarity from the SEC before making larger moves into the market. Related Reading: Is This The End For Ethereum Or A Generational Opportunity? Another factor boosting confidence in XRP is the recent inclusion of the cryptocurrency on the European version of Robinhood. As one of the largest trading and investment platforms, this is a major achievement for the cryptocurrency because it opens up adoption to the large European market. Lastly, the launch of the Grayscale XRP Trust itself has reignited hopes that a Spot XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) could soon follow. While no concrete applications have been made by any investment companies, the creation of the Grayscale XRP trust is seen as a critical first step toward the eventual approval of a Spot XRP ETF. At the time of writing, the altcoin has been trading at $0.59, which has been up by 1.17% in the past 24 hours.

BlackRock's ( BLK ) iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( NASDAQ: IBIT ) is the world's largest fund of the cryptocurrency, with net assets of $22.67B as of September 19, 2024. ""Options on IBIT would provide investors with a hedging and risk management tool to manage exposure to the price of bitcoin and bitcoin-related products and positions,"" the SEC said in a statement . The options would be physically settled with American-style exercise, which refers to an options contract that allows holders to exercise their rights at any time before and including the expiration date. The options on IBIT would trade in a similar manner as other ETF options, the SEC said. ""Huge win for the bitcoin ETFs (as it will attract more liquidity which will in turn attract more big fish),"" Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg, said on X (formerly Twitter). ""Important note: This is just one stage of approval, the OCC and CFTC has to approve as well before they officially list. The other two don't have a 'clock' so not sure when they'll be approved. A big step (though) nonetheless that the SEC came around,"" Balchunas added, referring to the Options Clearing Corporation and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Options are contracts that give investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy (a ""call"" option) or sell (a ""put"" option) an asset at a predetermined price before a specific date. With bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) tendency to show wild swings in price, options would allow investors to manage associated risks more effectively. The crypto industry in the U.S. received a major boost at the start of this year after the SEC's long-awaited approval of spot bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) exchange-traded products. Not long after, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surged to a record high north of $73K in March, though it has since retreated after its last halving on April 19, 2024. It was last +0.3% to $63,161.02. According to CoinMarketCap, the market cap of the global crypto industry stood at $2.2T. Here are some crypto-focused exchange-traded funds that investors can track: Bitcoin Backed ETFs: ( IBIT ), ( ARKB ), ( GBTC ), ( BRRR ), ( BTCO ), ( HODL ), ( BTCW ), ( FBTC ), ( BITB ), and ( EZBC ).

It’s Time For Ethereum To Shine Again Regarding price appreciation, ETH hasn’t had a particularly impressive 2024. While Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Tron (TRX) have witnessed considerable price gains, ETH is still trading at its January 2024 price levels. Notably, the second largest digital asset by market cap has tumbled 48% against Bitcoin since the Ethereum merged on September 15, 2022. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Reaches $2,500 Again: Will The Uptrend Hold? For the uninitiated, the Ethereum merge was a major milestone for the leading smart contract platform as it not only changed its consensus mechanism from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) but also razed down the issuance of new ETH from 4% to 1% annually. As a result, there has been a net negative ETH supply growth with more ETH being burned through transaction fees than issued to stakers. Ethereum’s unimpressive performance against Bitcoin can be confirmed from the following chart, where the ETH/BTC trading pair has fallen to 0.04, eroding all its gains against the flagship cryptocurrency since April 2021. However, a recent report by Steno Research opines that it’s time for Ethereum to come back. According to the report, the Fed’s decision to slash interest rates might be the fuel that propels ETH’s price surge in the coming months. The report references ETH’s performance during the last altcoin season, where it more than doubled in value compared to BTC in less than two months. This sudden growth was powered by a sharp increase in on-chain activity stemming from rising interest in ecosystems such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFT), and higher issuance of stablecoins. In a post on X, Mads Eberhardt, Senior Cryptocurrency Analyst at Steno Research, said: Lower interest rates -> More on-chain activity -> Greater Ethereum transactional revenue -> Lower ETH supply growth -> Higher ETH price. Let’s go. Several Reasons For Ethereum’s Underperformance Additionally, the report mentions that Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will likely outperform Bitcoin ETFs. Discussing the major reasons why BTC has overshadowed ETH until now, Eberhardt notes: The impact of U.S. spot ETFs for both bitcoin and ether, the persistent buying pressure from MicroStrategy (MSTR), and a notable decline in Ethereum’s transactional revenue in recent months. Related Reading: Ethereum In 2021 Vs. 2024: Fractal Suggests Major Breakout In Q4 Despite the headwinds it has faced, investor confidence in Ethereum continues to be strong.

Whale Transaction Count Has Spiked For These Altcoins Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed the Whale Transaction Count trend for three altcoins. The “Whale Transaction Count” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total number of transactions taking place on a given cryptocurrency network that involves a value of more than $100,000. Transfers of this scale are typically associated with whales, the largest entities on the network, so the indicator’s value can provide hints about the current activity from this cohort. Related Reading: Crypto Shorts Suffer $147 Million Squeeze As Bitcoin Returns Above $63,000 When the value of this metric is high, it means the whales are making a large amount of moves right now. Such a trend implies these humongous holders have an active interest in trading the coin. On the other hand, the indicator having a low value suggests this group may not be paying too much attention to the asset at the moment as they aren’t making that many transfers. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Whale Transaction Count for three altcoins, Immutable X (IMX), Fantom (FTM), and Basic Attention Token (BAT), over the last few weeks: As displayed in the above graph, large spikes in the Whale Transaction Count have been observed for all of these altcoins over the last couple of days. This would suggest that the whales have suddenly become very active on these networks. The timing of the spikes would mean this activity is likely related to the interest rate cut announced by the Fed. While the high values indicate a surge in trading interest from the whales, the Whale Transaction Count alone can’t tell us what sort of trades these humongous investors are making exactly. Buying and selling transactions both look the same from the perspective of the indicator, and thus, carry the same weightage in its count. What can provide hints about whether accumulation or distribution is dominant, though, is the surrounding price action. Bitcoin and the altcoins as a whole, including Immutable X and company, have surged since the Fed announcement, so the increased whale activity could be associated with buying.

Top Analyst Says Yes Naturally, any further spikes in whale activity aren’t necessary to be bullish, but Santiment notes that if Bitcoin and others continue to grow, then these altcoins can also thrive off a high Whale Transaction Count. IMX Price Immutable X has continued the latest bullish push during the last 24 hours with another surge of almost 10%, which has taken its price to $1.58.

33800102,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=643342,1726858845,"Dogecoin Open interest Remains Muted Below $500 Million, What’s Going On?","With the market recovery, open interest in major assets has been rising, but it seems Dogecoin is not following this trend. The meme coin has remained muted with a failure to move like other large caps such as Bitcoin and Solana. Naturally, the direction of open interest can have an impact on the performance of Dogecoin’s price. So, what could this muted open interest mean for the meme coin’s price going forward? Dogecoin Open Interest Fails To Move According to data from the Coinglass website, the Dogecoin open interest has failed to surpass the $500 million level once again. On Thursday, the Dogecoin open interest was $493.97 million, which is a long way from its all-time high. This comes even as the meme coin’s open interest surged 6.9% in the 24-hour period, with notable jumps across crypto exchange such as OKX and Bitget. Related Reading: October To Remember: Descending Broadening Wedge Says Bitcoin Is Going To $90,000 Despite this increase, the Dogecoin open interest is still firmly below its August highs. The open interest started out in August above $618 million. However, since then, it has remained muted, suggesting that crypto traders have turned their attention elsewhere. Even more concerning is the fact that the open interest is more than 70% below its all-time high from March 2024. On March 29, 2024, the Dogecoin open interest had reached a new peak of $2.21 billion. But since then, the open interest has been seeing a steady decline. At Thursday’s figures of $498 million, the DOGE open interest is now seeing a 77% decline from its March’s figures. Why This Decline Could Be Good For DOGE The open interest gives the total of the open options or futures contracts in the market for a particular digital asset. Basically, it helps investors to tell if traders are betting heavily on the recovery or decline of a cryptocurrency or not. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Crypto Pundit Predicts Historical 9,468% Pump To $27 Given Dogecoin’s data, it shows that traders are not exactly focused on the meme coin as they used to be. However, this is not always a bad thing, as periods of low open interest have often marked market bottoms. The low open interest usually gives investors a good time to enter into the coin, as the price often declines with the open interest. As the Bitcoin price recovers, it is expected that the Dogecoin price will follow, and when the open interest begins to recover, the DOGE price is expected to grow rapidly with it. A similar scenario was witnessed back in January 2024, with the open interest marking a bottom somewhere around $300 million. However, over the next few months, the open interest rose more than 630%, triggering an over 100% price surge for Dogecoin. If the same scenario plays out here, then the DOGE price could double once more. This would put the price firmly above the $0.2 level, especially with a bull run expected in the last quarter of the year.

42390348,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcUecF,1726857597,Altcoins Surge Leaving Bitcoin and Ether Behind After Fed Cuts Interest Rate,"Altcoins were the better performer after the Fed's decision to lower rates on Wednesday.  Cryptocurrencies excluding ether and bitcoin have risen 5.7% since the decision was announced while bitcoin is up 4.4%.  Experts say this divergence isn't unusual, given altcoin's poorer liquidity and higher beta.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} may have outperformed stocks in the aftermath of the Federal Reserve’s decision to lower interest rates on Wednesday, but the true winners in the crypto universe are altcoins.  Total3, an index that tracks the market capitalization of the top 125 cryptocurrencies, excluding bitcoin and ether {{ETH}}, was trading 5.68% higher since the central bank’s announcement that it would slash the Federal Funds rate by 50 basis points, according to data on TradingView. Bitcoin’s market cap, by contrast, rose only 4.4%.  This isn’t unusual, said Bob Wallden, head of trading at investment firm Abra.  “Altcoins are higher beta than bitcoin and ether, so think of them as a leveraged play on the broader crypto market similar to tech stocks outperforming the S&P 500 (SPX) in time of green shoots,” he said.  The asset class, which includes all crypto assets besides bitcoin and ether, might have also benefited from a recent period of overselling, which Wallden said is adding velocity to their bounce back.  The relatively low liquidity levels of altcoins means they tend to move with greater volatility, said Bohan Jiang, Head of OTC options trading at Abra.  “Altcoins are at the fringes of the liquidity spectrum, and so will always be convex in performance when risk assets perform well and liquidity is abundant, which seems to be the case post-FOMC,” he said.  “They also perform as a function of liquidity and positioning: liquidity in alts is substantially poorer, causing outsized moves both ways. Extended short positioning building up over the past few months can therefore cause short-squeeze-like outperformance higher.”  The Federal Reserve’s decision to lower interest rates pushed bitcoin above $64,000 on Thursday, a price last seen on Aug. 26. It later bounced back and is currently trading at $62,898.

42390353,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcUewl,1726856785,"Bitcoin Price and Hashrate Divergence May Set the Scene for a Potential Rally, Historical Data Shows","The divergence between Bitcoin's hash rate and price could signal a potential rally in prices, according to historical data.  September's counter-seasonal price trend has already started to show signs of this divergence trend playing out.  Publicly traded miners have increased their market share post-halving by raising their computing power and started accumulating bitcoin, potentially reducing market supply and raising a chance of upside to the price.  A divergence between bitcoin {{BTC}} price and its hashrate or network's total computing power could potentially point towards a rally in the price of the largest digital asset.  Historically, these divergences have occurred only a few times in the past three years. In some cases, bitcoin prices have reached a local bottom during these events, followed by a rally as the market catches up with the rising hash rate. Bitcoin network's hashrates rise and fall depending on how many miners have their mining computers online to validate transactions.  Consistent with this pattern, bitcoin has already shown signs of recovery, gaining about $9,000 since the local bottom on Sept. 6, representing a 15% increase in value. This divergence between bitcoin's {{BTC}} price and its hash rate started to shape up in July and then persisted into early September, when the computing power of the network reached an all-time high of 693 exahashes per second (EH/s) on a seven-day moving average, while bitcoin's price was near $54,000.  A significant factor contributing to the recent surge in hash rate is the activity of publicly traded mining companies. Before the halving - where bitcoin rewards get cut in half - the hash rate peaked at 650 EH/s and dropped to 550 EH/s in June, as less efficient miners exited the network due to higher competition. It has now returned to pre-halving levels as publicly traded miners that are well-capitalized, have increased their market share by raising their computing power.  Read more: What Is the Bitcoin Halving  In fact, data from the sixteen public companies show that they have almost reached a 23% market share in production, the highest since at least January 2023, according to the industry journal TheMinerMag. It is likely that publicly traded miners will continue to capture a larger share of the hash rate over time as they compete to stay profitable post-halving.  Counter-seasonal trend  September has historically been dubbed a bearish month for bitcoin, with historical data from Coinglass indicating an average price decline of 4%. However, this year has defied that trend, with bitcoin posting a 7% increase so far. This counter-seasonal trend could be indicating that due to the lower bitcoin price and rising hashrate, the price could be playing catch up with the hash rate, potentially setting up for another rally. Of course, there are other market factors such as interest rate decisions could also catalyze this price change.  Additionally, the next difficulty adjustment, scheduled for Sept. 25 and projected to decrease by 5%, could also indicate that prices may be catching up. Blocks are currently being mined at an average of 10.5 minutes, according to mempool.space. This indicates a potential slowdown in the hash rate as price plays catch up.  Miners accumulating  Another factor that could signal a potential rise in price is what miners are doing with their mined bitcoin.  Glassnode data indicates that from November 2023 to August 2024, miners consistently sold bitcoin to fund their operations due to the halving, marking one of the longest periods of sell pressure on record.  However, in the past 30 days, miners began accumulating bitcoin in their wallets, suggesting that the financial strain from the halving is largely over. If miners are distributing less bitcoin, this reduces the supply entering the market, increasing the chance of potentially helping the price.

42390332,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcUdch,1726856374,The Next Stage for Public Good Funding in Crypto,"If you’ve spent any time in Web3, you’ve likely come across the term “public goods.” While its definition is often debated, the need to fund public goods is widely accepted by those who understand its importance. Key figures like Vitalik Buterin, the Ethereum Foundation, and organizations such as Protocol Guild, Octant, Optimism, and Gitcoin have made this a priority.  Traditionally, funding public goods has been seen as a charitable act. But what if there was another way — one that could drive innovation within the ecosystem while preserving the essence of public goods funding? What if we could transform some public goods into private greats?  To start, let’s define public goods in a way that will make sense for this article. Traditionally, public goods are commodities or services provided without profit to all members of society, typically by the government or private organizations. Common examples include clean air, roads, bridges, and libraries — essential resources that benefit everyone, regardless of individual contribution.  In Web3, however, the definition of public goods shifts slightly. As defined by a16z, “the classic challenge of decentralized networks is that they are public goods. Without a central entity to control decisions and capture profits, it is hard to incentivize their maintenance and development. Crypto helps solve this problem through decentralized coordination and economic incentives for development. Web3 will put the power in the hands of communities rather than corporations.” This version of public goods is built on decentralized systems that require a different model of sustainability.  While governments have historically managed public goods through centralized control and taxation, Web3 presents a unique challenge due to its decentralized structure, which lacks a similar enforcement mechanism.  If we consider the digital equivalents of roads, bridges, and tunnels in Web3, much of this infrastructure is open-source software — critical to running decentralized networks but equally in need of ongoing funding. Unlike traditional public goods, which governments can maintain through taxation, Web3 lacks a similar guarantee of revenue.  Without a central authority to mandate contributions or oversee funding, Web3 ecosystems must find alternative methods to sustain the infrastructure that supports their decentralized networks.  How do we fund these digital public goods when there’s no system in place to tax users or corporations to support their upkeep? There are already a few innovative models in place that aim to make public goods funding self-sustaining, but others are still needed.  One recent example has been the Protocol Guild Pledge, introduced by Tim Beiko, of the Ethereum Foundation, earlier this year. Their mission is to contribute to Ethereum L1 research and development through normalizing the idea of projects built on Ethereum to donate 1% of their native token to Protocol Guild.  Read more: Azeem Khan - It’s Time to Build a Sustainable Blockchain Ecosystem  There’s also Octant, which is aiming to create a self-sustaining model of public goods funding in a new version of crypto altruism. Supported with 100,000 staked ETH from the Golem Foundation’s treasury, a portion of those returns are used to give back to impactful projects using governance where the community can keep or donate staking rewards of $GLM. To date, over 1150 ETH has been distributed to over 40 projects in just a year.  Optimism’s Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) supports projects w based on their impact, orchestrated through community voting with grants rounds that take place twice a year. To date, it has distributed over 50 million $OP tokens across RPGF 1, RPGF 2, RPGF 3, and RPGF 4.  Organizations like Gitcoin, which began running grants rounds in 2019, have distributed over $60 million using a novel community-driven capital allocation method called quadratic funding. This system has enabled many projects to flourish, with several recipients of these grants going on to become some of the most successful companies in the Ethereum ecosystem.  Companies such as Uniswap, Optimism, Yearn, Gnosis, and 1Inch are examples of early Gitcoin grantees. The collective market caps of those that launched tokens, alongside the private valuations of others that raised capital without live tokens, far exceed the amount of funding initially provided. While many of these companies have given back to the ecosystem by donating to public goods, raising new funds for future rounds remains a challenge. This is especially true during bear markets, when capital is scarce, and venture funding is harder to secure.  A new model  Although not all public goods projects evolve into profitable ventures, whether through revenue generation or token issuance, it’s certainly within the realm of possibility. But what if there were a built-in model where companies benefiting from public goods funding returned a portion of their success to the community?  We need a system where a percentage of proceeds or profits were reinvested into public goods by those who benefited from them could ensure long-term sustainability. Unlike the Protocol Guild Pledge, where contributions specifically support Ethereum L1 R&D, this model would channel funds into a broader vehicle that reinvests directly into the overall ecosystem. While Protocol Guild focuses on Ethereum’s core development, this broader reinvestment model would support the diverse array of public goods necessary for a thriving Web3 ecosystem.  When considering vehicles to collect and distribute capital, a structured venture fund specifically designed to support public goods seems like the most effective option. This model would shift public goods funding from being a charitable act to becoming an integral part of business operations. These funds would be managed by experts in capital allocation, with the focus not on personal profit, but on strengthening and expanding the ecosystem. Typically, venture funds allocate 2% of total capital annually for operational expenses, including salaries and other costs. In a common model, 20% of the fund's profits, known as ""carry,"" are allocated to the fund managers, while the remaining 80% goes back to the investors who contributed to the fund.  Using a model like this would allow companies that receive investment to return a portion of their success to the initial fund that helped them grow. The venture fund partners, experienced in investing, would still have financial incentives to generate returns through a portion of “carry,” in addition to their salaries. These salaries could be substantial, depending on the assets under management.  Read more: Azeem Khan - Crypto’s Venture Capital Gap  This alignment of incentives ensures that fund managers remain motivated to invest in successful projects, as their own financial success is tied to the ecosystem’s overall health and growth. As each success contributes back to the fund, its size would continue to grow. If aligning incentives leads to better outcomes, this approach to privatizing the investment of public goods could have a significant impact.  Receiving investment from this fund could signal to the ecosystem that a project is committed to giving back, distinguishing it from those that don’t. This positive reinforcement could enhance the fund’s reputation, attracting top deals and enabling it to continuously reinvest in the public goods ecosystem.  Public goods funding is a complex issue, and there may be no one-size-fits-all solution. . While charitable models have been the primary approach so far, the idea of privatizing public goods investment — allowing them to thrive without relying on charity — presents a compelling path forward. By aligning incentives and creating new funding vehicles, we can ensure that public goods become an integral, self-sustaining part of Web3’s long-term growth. Now is the time to rethink how we fund the infrastructure that powers decentralized networks.

42390347,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcUdmx,1726853517,Why We Won’t See CBDCs Everywhere,"CBDCs have been a hot topic for a while, with governments trialing pilot schemes and conducting research. But it's all talk. The reality is that globally, CBDCs are going nowhere for at least 20 years.  Research into CBDCs has been going on around the world for the last decade and has increased rapidly over a short space of time. In 2020, only 35 countries were exploring a CBDC – now, according to the Atlantic Council, the figure stands at 134.  But, for all of the countries exploring a CBDC, only three have fully implemented one: the Bahamas, Nigeria and Jamaica. So, while CBDCs might be the current trend, they’re not exactly becoming global reality.  Look, I do get the appeal. As a fully digital form of a country’s currency, they’re essentially the final frontier for a completely digital payments system. They could extend financial services to those who are unbanked, too. Who wouldn't want to bring financial inclusion and easy, hassle-free payments to the masses?  Blockchain tech has the potential to transform the way we bank, but when you dig down a little deeper into CBDCs, it becomes clear that implementing them on a global scale isn't feasible.  That’s because countries have to overcome so many hurdles. This is particularly true in the U.S. While global CBDCs would rely on more than just Uncle Sam, it's a fundamental cog in the grand vision. And the Fed is nowhere near issuing a digital dollar.  First, you'd have to deal with public opinion; CBDCs are too contentious. The consensus worldwide is pretty negative, but nowhere more so than in the U.S. As of May 2023, only 16% of Americans supported the idea of a CBDC (Cato Institute), citing fears of government control. In other countries, CBDCs are less contentious and partisan. Still, according to the CFA Institute, 34% still believe that central banks should not issue digital versions of their currencies.  These digital currencies have become political tools, and not much more. Republicans, including Donald Trump and House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, are staunchly opposed. And, even though Democrat officials have researched a U.S. CBDC, it's looking unlikely that a Harris-Walz administration would pursue one. I don't believe that either side will commit to a CBDC, further stalling global implementation.  One of the most compelling arguments for implementing global CBDCs is that they will advance cross-border payments. Our current systems move slowly and cost an excessive amount to operate. It's estimated that in 2020, $23.5 trillion was transferred across borders, costing a colossal $120 billion to facilitate (Intereconomics), a ridiculous expense.  So, I understand why, if you view CBDCs as a tool to bring these costs down, you'd favor pushing along their development. But the fact remains that to fix cross-border payments through CBDCs, you'd need to rely on solid worldwide geopolitical relationships. And, unfortunately, we don't have those. The world is too fragmented, too unruly, to allow CBDCs to be implemented globally.  Plus, we'd need to rethink entire financial structures, develop new regulatory frameworks, cybersecurity and data safeguards, and alter our approach to monetary policy. There isn't the appetite to warrant these changes on a global scale.  At the end of the day, these factors will limit CBDCs around the globe. It's hard to envisage a world where the benefits outweigh the challenges.  A more realistic way forward is with stablecoins, which bring some of the benefits of CBDCs. Crucially, they are more appealing to the public; they’re decentralized and offer business opportunities.  But besides facilitating crypto trades, unlike CBDCs, we also already have stablecoin success stories. Tether, for example, has taken up approximately 75% of the stablecoin market, and built up a net profit of $5.2 billion in the first half of this year.  And it’s not just economic value that stablecoins bring; they’re optimizing transactions, too. In 2023, Visa announced they were extending their use of stablecoins, integrating Circle’s USDC on the Solana blockchain after a successful pilot. As a result, their cross-border settlement speed accelerated significantly.  So, you see, stablecoins are a more realistic way of unlocking the benefits of CBDCs, and they’re already in use. The U.S. public is less skeptical of them, and they are privately issued, providing economic and business value. This is precisely where the appetite is – stablecoins will be far easier to implement in the short term.  Sure, many countries are actively researching CBDCs, even the ECB has looked into a digital Euro, but when all is said and done, it’s just a trend. The hype will probably continue as governments transition their financial systems to suit the ever-approaching digital transformation, but it doesn’t mean CBDCs will come to fruition.  As soon as central banks see the blockers, they’ll admit defeat. The challenges are insurmountable; that’s why we haven’t seen a CBDC success story yet.  CBDCs might appear exciting at first glance, but lurking underneath the surface is a complex web of problems tying up any chance of global momentum. They’re simply the latest fashion and, if current barriers and backlash are anything to go by, I don’t think we’ll see global, interoperable CBDCs for 20 years. If at all.

And market watchers have indeed taken notice. On the inside, however, is key on-chain data that suggests Bitcoin whale accumulation and the reactivation of dormant wallets may be signs for a super price spike ahead. Related Reading: Cardano Goes Bullish On-Chain: Can ADA Price Catch Up?

Such an increase indicates that big players position themselves to make what they believe could be another major price move. Whales are accumulating #Bitcoin. Six days of accumulation alerts in a row. Primarily from custody wallet inflows. Nothing has changed for Bitcoin; we’re in the middle of the bull cycle. pic.twitter.com/DE0A1Khhus — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) September 18, 2024 Dormant Wallets Spring Back To Life The trend in past months has been the revival of dormant Bitcoin wallets. For instance, 203 BTC, valued at $12.18 million, were transferred from wallets that were inactive for more than a year to Binance, earning a whale $6.89 million in profit. The second wallet has been unused for over a decade, with 146 BTC inside. That would total to $8.09 million today. In 2013, it would have only sold for $80,257, which is an astonishing 9,985% rise. Whale Accumulation Signals Long-Term Optimism The accumulation pattern follows the recent Bitcoin price rallies and fuels speculations that whales are waiting for the prices to scale even higher. Ju’s analytical insights raise the notion that institutional investors are not losing faith in Bitcoin’s future even with the volatility since March 2024. The price of bitcoin has risen from a starting point in September at $58,909 to $59,530. Although it did fall briefly on Sept. 6 to the lowest level at $53,940, the strong pressure of whales and institutions buying it pushed the price up. More Gains Expected: Technical Indicators The price for Bitcoin to $63,637 has now indicated impressive potential to push upwards, backed by the technical factors. The near future crossover between the 50-day and the 200-day Exponential Moving Averages point to a more positive trajectory. Also, the RSI currently stands at 46.79, which is still not over the overbought value, meaning that there is a good amount of room left for the price to rise without the market getting too extended.

MicroStrategy Invests Additional $458 Million In BTC Of the funds raised, MicroStrategy allocated $458 million to purchase additional Bitcoin between September 13 and September 19, further bolstering its position as the cryptocurrency’s largest publicly traded corporate holder. As of September 19, the company reported holding approximately 252,220 Bitcoin, valued at around $15.8 billion. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts A Solana Price Crash To $80 If This Happens The convertible notes issued by MicroStrategy carry an interest rate of 0.625% and will mature in 2028. This marks the fourth time this year that the company has turned to the convertible note market to finance its Bitcoin acquisitions. In conjunction with the new issuance, MicroStrategy is redeeming $500 million of higher-interest 6.125% notes due in 2028, reflecting a strategic shift to lower borrowing costs while expanding its crypto portfolio. Co-founder and Chairman Michael Saylor has played a pivotal role in shaping MicroStrategy’s identity as a cryptocurrency investment vehicle since the company first ventured into Bitcoin in 2020. Under his leadership, the firm has transformed from a traditional enterprise software maker into a de facto crypto hedge fund, demonstrating a bold commitment to digital assets amid market fluctuations. MicroStrategy’s stock has also seen significant gains this year, more than doubling in value and outperforming Bitcoin’s approximately 50% increase over the same period. The latest acquisition follows MicroStrategy’s earlier purchase of 18,300 Bitcoin, valued at roughly $1.11 billion last week. Bitcoin Price Analysis Following what has been deemed a bullish catalyst, the broader cryptocurrency market has responded positively to the US Federal Reserve’s announcement on Wednesday of a 0.50% basis point rate cut. This decision contributed to the recovery over the past week after Bitcoin’s price retraced to as low as $52,640 on September 6. Bitcoin has managed to reclaim the $63,000 mark, aiming to consolidate above this critical level for the last 24 hours. Market analyst Ali Martinez points out that this price point coincides with Bitcoin’s 200-day simple moving average (SMA) on its BTC/USDT daily chart, which Martinez identifies as a pivotal threshold for the anticipated bull run in the latter part of the year. Historically, failures to maintain this support level have led to significant corrections, as observed in 2020, 2018, and 2014. Martinez warns that a rejection at this level could signal trouble for Bitcoin’s future price trajectory.

In addition, introducing new liquidity into the market could significantly boost the Bitcoin price, as the Fed’s decision may boost investor confidence in riskier assets such as BTC. A successful break and consolidation above $63,000 could set the stage for a potential challenge of the next resistance level at $64,000 in the coming days.

Key data from Santiment reveals that whales are actively accumulating XRP, having purchased over $228 million in the past few days. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Will Surge 1,000% Past ATH – Price Targets Revealed This aggressive accumulation suggests a growing confidence among large holders as the market rallies toward higher prices. Analysts and investors closely watch XRP, anticipating a breakout from key supply levels that could trigger a rally to new highs. With bullish sentiment rising, the next few days will be crucial in determining XRP’s price direction and its role in the ongoing market cycle. Will this whale activity lead to a major upward move, or could XRP remain in its current range? Only time will tell, but expectations are high as momentum builds in the broader crypto market. XRP Investors Waiting For A Big Move The crypto market has seen a significant surge, with Bitcoin and many altcoins posting double-digit percentage gains in recent days. The Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points sparked this rally, fueling optimism among investors now eyeing the potential start of a new crypto bull run. While investor sentiment for XRP has turned positive, the market has not yet reflected this in the token’s valuation. Top analysts and market participants are sharing insights that suggest XRP may be gearing up for a strong performance this cycle. One prominent technical and on-chain analyst, Ali, highlighted compelling data from Santiment, which shows that XRP whales are making substantial moves. In the past 10 days, these large holders have purchased over 380 million XRP, valued at approximately $228 million. This marks the highest level of whale accumulation since early August, a bullish signal for XRP. The accumulation of XRP by whales—often considered “smart money”—is a sign of strength and confidence in the token’s future price action. Related Reading: XRP ‘The Safest Investment To Make 100% ROI’ – Former Asset Manager Shares Price Targets As the broader market continues to push higher, investors are optimistic that this accumulation could be an early indicator of a major rally for XRP in the coming days. With momentum building, many are positioning for the next big move. Price Levels To Watch XRP is currently trading at $0.59 after several days of choppy price action, testing a supply level around this range. While XRP remains above the daily 200 moving average (MA) at $0.549—a sign of long-term strength—it has struggled to close above the $0.60 mark since late August. For bulls to trigger a move to new local highs, the price must reclaim the $0.60 level and hold above it. Doing so would set the stage for a challenge to a key liquidity zone around $0.65. The $0.65 price point has served as a significant resistance level, unbroken since early March. It’s also considered a psychological barrier that, if breached, could drive the price to higher levels rapidly. Investors and analysts are keeping a close watch on this level, as breaking through it would likely bring renewed bullish momentum. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaking Out Of Monthly Downtrend: Can DOGE Reach $12? However, if the price fails to close above the current price level in the coming days, a pullback toward the daily 200 MA around $0.55 is expected. This would mark a critical test of support, and any breach below this level could signal further downside risk for the token.

42390351,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcUehN,1726848000,Prediction Markets Go to Washington('s Appeals Court),"The CFTC is working to ban political prediction markets. Its current goal: Get a federal appeals court to keep one from launching while it argues a judge was mistaken in overturning its rejection of Kalshi.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Prediction markets  The narrative  It's unclear whether political prediction markets will launch in the U.S. before the election (I'm not counting Kalshi's 8-hour effort last week). The ball's in an appeals court to make a decision one way or another, and a 2.5-hour hearing on Thursday elicited few clues about where the judges may land.  Why it matters  While Kalshi's prediction markets aren't directly crypto-related, if Kalshi does win the ability to list and trade political event contracts, it may open the door for other providers to enter – or possibly re-enter – the U.S. market.  Breaking it down  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is in the middle of a rulemaking process to ban political prediction markets in the U.S. entirely by formally adding these types of event contracts to the definition of ""gaming."" That effort took a major blow last week, when District of Columbia District Judge Jia Cobb ruled against the regulator in Kalshi v. CFTC.  Some quick background: Kalshi tried to self-certify political prediction markets in 2023, but the CFTC ordered that the company could not list or trade those products. Kalshi sued, and on Sept. 6, the judge ruled that Kalshi won – though she didn't actually publish her opinion explaining the ruling until Sept. 12.  The full opinion goes into detail about how the judge assessed the CFTC's definition of ""gaming"" and ""involves"" as they pertain to the statute (the Commodity Exchange Act) the regulator used to reject the products.  The CFTC filed an emergency stay for appeal hours after Kalshi launched its new contracts, willing at least a temporary halt while the appeals court judges consider the emergency motion.  As of the time I'm writing this, the contracts are still halted. The appeals court scheduled a hearing for Thursday, giving each party 15 minutes to make its case – though ultimately it ran for some 2.5 hours. We'll presumably find out if the contracts can restart before the election happens after the hearing, but there's no firm timeline here. And of course, there's still the broader question about the appeal itself and how that may go.  The broader picture, of course, is the CFTC's ongoing rulemaking around the role of political prediction markets in the U.S. The CFTC's view is it shouldn't be responsible for overseeing these because it'd be too difficult for the regulator to police the underlying market – i.e. the results of the U.S. elections – for fraud and manipulation.  The markets themselves may be subject to manipulation through the use of misleading or false polling data, CFTC General Counsel Rob Schwartz argued in court Thursday. And manipulation on prediction markets may further undermine confidence in elections themselves.  Kalshi's view is these concerns are besides the point, because Congress authorized the CFTC to block certain types of event contracts and election markets aren't on the list.  ""Their argument comes down to characterizing these event contracts as involving either gaming or unlawful activity,"" said Jones Day Partner Yaakov Roth. ""The problem as to both is that the Commission's interpretations of how the statute works and how this link what this language means are so broad that they would sweep all event contracts, thereby rendering the other enumerated activity superfluous and flipping the whole structure of how this statute works. And they have not been able to give a limiting principle.""  Roth represents Kalshi in its case against the CFTC.  Schwartz pointed to the Commodity Exchange Act and its preemption of state laws in his argument, noting that some states have laws banning election wagers. The CEA preempts state law, so allowing Kalshi to list political event contracts may run into conflicts with those laws, in one hypothetical.  The judges grilled both attorneys, seemingly unimpressed by either over the course of the 2.5-hour hearing (which was originally set to last 30 minutes). It remains to be seen how they'll rule on the temporary stay.

42390340,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcUeCb,1726847301,Consensys Suit Against U.S. SEC Dismissed by Texas Court,"A federal court in Texas decided Consensys' recent lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission wasn't warranted, because it's underlying legal danger had ceased.  Consensys is still in a legal battle with the U.S. securities regulator over MetaMask.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had – for a time – added Consensys to a list of crypto investigation targets, prompting the technology incubator company to sue it for overreach in federal court. Because the regulator then shut down that Ethereum probe earlier this year, a Texas judge has decided the lack of immediate danger means the lawsuit is unwarranted.  Judge Reed O’Connor of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas noted in a Thursday filing that ""because withholding consideration subjects plaintiff to scant, if any, hardship, the claim lacks a ripe case or controversy."" In other words, since there's no clear future threat to Consensys, there's no point in this judge weighing in.  ""In a significant win for the industry, the SEC dropped its 'Ethereum 2.0' investigation after our litigation was filed, and the Texas court today recognized that the SEC already gave Consensys the relief it sought on that critical issue for the Ethereum ecosystem,"" the company said in a post on X.  Read More: SEC Ends Probe Into Consensys, Won't Sue Over Ethereum  Consensys argued that its lawsuit ""laid bare the overzealous investigation of Ethereum, and policymakers and the public at large voiced deep concern over the SEC’s investigation of blockchain software development.""  A spokesperson for the SEC declined to comment on the case being dismissed.  When Consensys sued the agency in April, it asked the court to declare that Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} is not a security and that any investigation of ConsenSys based on the idea that the token is a security would trample on the company's rights. It also contended that MetaMask is not a broker under federal law and that its staking service doesn't violate securities law.  After backing down in the ETH investigation, the SEC did follow up with charges against Consensys later in June, alleging that the company's MetaMask service was acting as an unregistered securities broker.  While the SEC hasn't made a public statement about ETH's status, last week, the regulator settled charges with eToro which let the trading platform continue listing ETH in the U.S.  UPDATE (September 20, 2022, 18:16 UTC): Adds decline to comment from the Securities and Exchange Commission.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/09/20/consensys-suit-against-us-sec-dismissed-by-texas-court,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d7f5c8783a6d7db29734a6488ca59ef9761a8741-5459x3071.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. We begin our analysis with the tables above, which reveal how Bitcoin’s key fundamentals have changed over the past year. Twelve months to date, bitcoin’s price is up 124%, outperforming nearly every major asset class. Even within crypto, BTC has outperformed. Bitcoin dominance, a measure of Bitcoin’s market cap versus crypto’s total market cap, is up 15% YoY to 56%. There is clearly much more interest in Bitcoin and digital assets today than one year ago. Bitcoin trading volumes have grown 173% YoY, significantly outpacing equity trading volumes, up ~18% YoY. Although price returns for equities have been great, capital formation has been dismal. Capital raised from global equity IPOs is on a $68B pace for 2024, a 31% decline vs. 2023. The number of IPOs is on pace to fall by 42%. (For context, $748B was raised in 4,000 IPOs in the debt-fueled 2021 bonanza). Among private transactions, U.S. Venture Capital invested is up 9% y/y, while Crypto VC flows are up 87% over the same period. Bitcoin’s adoption as an investment vehicle isn’t driven by the same forces today as in 2023 when it rose 155%. Then, Bitcoin inscriptions were a viral innovation enabling users to store media files directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. Inscriptions ushered in a viral new wave of blockchain-based art, notably bringing retail liquidity and trading fees to the Bitcoin blockchain, which was previously left out of the NFT craze of the last market cycle. Like previous NFTs, however, the trend ended in a crash, reflected by the 93% YoY drawdown in daily inscriptions transactions. The decline in inscriptions undoubtedly explains the 34% and 52% YoY declines in daily active addresses and transaction fees, respectively. With Bitcoin’s on-chain activity diminished, bitcoin’s price appreciation this year is better explained by growing adoption as money: a vehicle for storing and transferring value. Despite fewer on-chain retail transactions, USD-denominated on-chain Bitcoin transfer volumes are up 202% YoY, implying larger overall ticket sizes. In parallel, despite lower fees, Bitcoin-related equities are capturing value by facilitating the growth of its monetary network’s adoption, with their collective market cap up 87% YoY. Based on month-over-month (MoM) price changes by region, the long-term trend of Asia selling BTC to North America continued in 2024, with investors enjoying outsized benefits during US trading hours. Bitcoin Miner Behavior 2024 has been a terrible year for Bitcoin Miner fundamentals. The Bitcoin Hashprice, a unit of profitability in the industry that measures the revenue earned for each one trillion cryptographic hash calculations per second, is down 97% y/y, far exceeding its 10-year CAGR of 69%, otherwise known as Bitcoin Miners’ “melting ice cube.” However, publicly traded miners entered the year reasonably well-capitalized, and with their low power costs and benefits of scale, now control 27% of the Bitcoin hash rate (a measure of total compute power securing the network), compared to 15% back in 24% a year ago and 15% in 2022. Now, with the halving well behind us, USD-denominated transfer volumes from miners to exchanges (a proxy for selling pressure) are down 60% YoY, indicating that miners have weathered the halving event and are now in financial solid positions - especially when considering the recent emergence of AI growth strategies. Let’s dig deeper into the hash rate and the post-halving action. Following the halving on April 19th, the 7-day moving average of Bitcoin’s hash fell ~15% from its all-time high of 650 EH/s to 552 EH/s by June 28th, in line with what we predicted before the event. This period corresponds to miners continuing to sell BTC, presumably indicating the forced exit of weaker, less efficient players. By July 26th, however, the network hash rate had rebounded to reach a new all-time high of ~670 EH/s, indicating that these more well-capitalized miners filled the void by increasing capacity. With today’s mining difficulty at all-time highs, miners compete harder than ever for their share of the network’s block rewards. However, the most recent data show that miners have begun accumulating bitcoin holdings for the first time since the halving. Aggregate BTC Supply Held by Miners Increased for the First Time since the Halving Source: Glassnode as of 9/13/2024. Observing the divergence in miner behavior has been fascinating and relevant to share performance. Some miners like CleanSpark (CLSK), Cipher Mining (CIFR), and Marathon Digital ( MARA ) are leveraging their strength by aggressively increasing their BTC positions. Generally, those are underperforming. A handful of others, notably Core Scientific (CORZ), Bit Digital (BTBT), and Hut 8 (HUT), have reduced their holdings to pay off debts, upgrade their fleets, and pursue new business opportunities. Some Publicly Traded Miners Adjust BTC Holding Strategies, Anticipating BTC Price Action & New Business Opportunities Source: Company Filings, Monthly Production Reports as of 9/10/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Some bitcoin miners are increasingly capitalizing on a new revenue opportunity by entering the AI and high-performance computing (HPC) markets. AI “hyperscalers” are placing a premium on access to near-term power due to bottlenecks in grid expansions, cloud computing’s strong pricing power, and the resulting power capacity arms race. CORZ, for example, has secured multiple contracts with AI hyperscaler CoreWeave, which is projected to generate over $4.7 billion in revenue by providing 382 MW of infrastructure over the next 12 years. This compares to the company’s last 12 months’ revenues of $574M. While miners’ pivot to AI is a time arbitrage opportunity in the near term, it may also prove to be a long-term strategic advantage by dampening revenue volatility and lowering the cost of capital for miners. Our previous research estimates that if 20% of miners’ energy capacity is allocated to AI/HPC, the total additional yearly profits could exceed $13.9 billion for a cohort of companies who collectively lost $350M net over the last 12 months. We see substantial value in this strategy. Historical Context of The Halving 143 days post-halving, bitcoin is overdue by historical standards to reach and sustain prices above its price at halving. Below, we explain why we think a catch-up rally is the most likely outcome. The TLDR is that bitcoin’s price lags behind previous cycles due to a mix of election anxiety and specific sales by entities unlikely to repeat. Meanwhile, the most important adoption from our perspective, that of nation-states, is accelerating. We will explain this in detail below. History Suggests Logarithmic BTC Price Growth Post-Halving Source: Glassnode as of 9/12/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Rising Institutional & Sovereign Adoption Growth Drivers The diverging trends between Bitcoin’s on-chain activity and its growth as an investment vehicle can be attributed to two main forces: institutional adoption and the increasing involvement of sovereign nations in mining and cross-border trade. First, driven by technical abstractions and regulatory improvements (e.g., custody solutions, ETPs), individuals and corporations increasingly gain exposure to Bitcoin without touching the blockchain themselves. Second, there is a growing trend of countries adopting Bitcoin for monetary and trade purposes. Combined, these trends are shifting the dynamics of both Bitcoin’s on-chain fundamentals and off-chain markets. Clearly, institutional adoption has increased. Since launching in January of this year, bitcoin ETPs gained over $19 billion in new inflows from hedge funds, RIAs, insurance companies, and pension funds through August. However, while hedge fund holdings of bitcoin ETPs grew 38% in Q2, RIA bitcoin ETP holdings only grew 4%. 2 Full-service, national brokerage (so-called ‘Wirehouse’) adoption of bitcoin ETPs has clearly been slower than some hoped. We attribute this to a lack of updated “60/40” macro model portfolios that include bitcoin. While we believe this “sell-side” research will eventually materialize, some managers are increasingly marketing and distributing “all in one” or model portfolios incorporating bitcoin. While we wait for potentially more aggressive allocations from brokers like Morgan Stanley and UBS, it is possible that their hesitancy may accelerate market share losses to independent advisors and vertically integrated models. We will closely watch institutional inflows or outflows into crypto, as these can serve as leading indicators of broader market sentiment. Shifting focus from institutional to sovereign adoption, seven nations are now mining bitcoin with direct support from the national government, with three new entrants this year (Ethiopia, Kenya, and Argentina). We believe this trend is a key indicator of the global shift towards de-dollarization. For example, Russia's pilot of cross-border trade denominated in crypto raises questions about which nations might follow suit, especially when the war inevitably ends. The implications for Bitcoin are significant, as government-level mining and cross-border crypto transactions could bolster Bitcoin’s role as a global reserve asset, as we wrote about in recent research . As de-dollarization gains momentum, we anticipate more countries and increased governmental involvement in digital assets, especially Bitcoin. Asset Correlations & Volatility Do Sharp Deviations in BTC and Nasdaq’s Correlation Predict a Shift in BTC’s Price? Source: Bloomberg as of 9/11/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Digging into broader market correlation and volatility data, we observe signals that suggest a potential breakout, marking the end of the summer doldrums that have defined Bitcoin’s post-halving price action. After a sharp decline, BTC’s correlation with the Nasdaq printed a local bottom on March 13th - the day of Bitcoin’s all-time high. Six months later, the correlation between these assets peaked on September 6th. This peak coincides with bitcoin miners’ slowdown in coin selling and a 3+ year high in long-term holders adding to their BTC positions. We think this might indicate a possible shift in market structure. Long-Term BTC Holders Ended the Summer by Buying BTC at Record 3Y Rates Source: Glassnode as of 9/11/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. On the topic of correlation, such a focus among clients, we want to highlight that despite the rising daily correlation in recent months, our analysis revealed a weak Pearson correlation of -0.056 between bitcoin’s daily price changes and its 90-day correlation with the Nasdaq over the 365 days leading to September 10th, 2024. Why is the Pearson Correlation important? To explain this, imagine two runners (bitcoin and the Nasdaq) running side by side. Regular correlation shows that they generally move in the same direction - speeding up or slowing down together over time. However, Pearson correlation looks at the details, such as how closely their individual strides match each other. Even if they’re running in the same general direction, their steps might not align. One runner could have uneven, unpredictable steps while the other moves more consistently. In this case, bitcoin’s daily price changes are like those uneven steps, which don’t strongly influence how closely it tracks the Nasdaq in the long term. We believe these headline correlations exaggerate the real connection between Bitcoin and Nasdaq, especially when focusing on short-term fluctuations. As we look ahead, volatility remains a key factor in determining bitcoin’s near-term price action. By comparing the annualized volatility of bitcoin and other major assets, we can gain insight into how Bitcoin’s current stability fits into broader market trends. For example, while BTC and ETH are trading close to their 1Y average volatility, traditional assets like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and JPY are experiencing higher-than-usual vol. This divergence suggests to us that Bitcoin may be poised for a breakout from its current pattern. The S&P 500, Nasdaq’s, and JPY’s Current Volatilities are at Relative 1Y Highs Compared to BTC’s, ETH’s, and Gold’s Source: Bloomberg as of 9/11/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Volatility refers to the fluctuation in the returns of an asset or portfolio as measured by the standard deviation of returns. The question, of course, is whether bitcoin’s next volatile move will be to the upside or downside. We note that a combination of entity-specific selling and political uncertainties have kept most of the risk-on capital that typically flows to bitcoin sidelined. In July and August, the German & U.S. governments transferred 62k bitcoin to exchanges, presumably for sale, while Mt. Gox and Gemini bankruptcy distributions totaled another 124k bitcoins. That’s $11B in non-repeatable sales, roughly equivalent to the net inflows to bitcoin ETPs in the first two months of trading. The market’s cautious risk appetite has instead favored tech companies like Nvidia ( NVDA ), which has driven outsized returns for the Nasdaq. However, we believe that much of the fear surrounding carry trade unwinds and election outcomes are largely priced in. Thus, we anticipate the bitcoin breakout will be bullish, with the upcoming debt ceiling deadline on September 30th and the approaching U.S. Presidential Election the most obvious catalysts for upside volatility. Furthermore, while BTC’s correlation with the Nasdaq fluctuates, its more consistent inverse correlation with the USD offers a more logical and persistent explanation for its outsized performance. As illustrated in the chart below, the low interest rates, quantitative easing, and money printing of 2020 only intensified this process. More simply, in the parlance of that era, “money printer go brrr.” Impact of the Fed & U.S. Elections Intensified by 2020’s ‘Money Printing’, BTC is Persistently Negatively Correlated with USD Source: Bloomberg as of 9/11/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Fed Rate Cuts Both the Fed’s upcoming rate decisions and the U.S. presidential election present significant potential impacts on the digital assets space. Suppose the Fed continues cutting rates in response to slowing economic growth. In that case, it may be bullish for risk-on assets like bitcoin, which may once again benefit as investors seek high-return alternatives to low-yield bonds. As we have illustrated, digital assets have shown a strong correlation to a weak dollar and money supply growth (global liquidity), making them particularly sensitive to shifts in monetary policy. Investors should also closely monitor the actions of other central banks, as the Bank of Japan’s recent mere 0.25% interest rate hike caused cascading liquidations due to over-levered carry trades unwinding around the globe. While such events clearly threaten the near-term risk appetite for Bitcoin and other digital assets, we think they reveal the weakness underlying today’s fiat currencies and thus underscore the rising popularity of decentralized monetary assets like bitcoin and gold. U.S. General Election On the political front, we think that while Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are bullish for Bitcoin, each presents more nuanced implications for the broader digital asset markets. Both administrations will likely maintain fiscal spending if not further accelerate, which could lead to further quantitative easing - especially if exacerbated by anti-business policies. Suppose Kamala Harris were to retain Gary Gensler as SEC Chair or align closely with the Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic Party when it comes to finance policy, which looks increasingly likely. In that case, the digital assets industry generally is expected to confront a tightening regulatory environment that would dampen institutional adoption of digital assets in the U.S., further restricting domestic entrepreneurial activity. On Bitcoin alone, however, we would argue that a Kamala Harris presidency might be even better for Bitcoin than a second term for Trump because it would, in our view, accelerate many of the structural issues that drive Bitcoin adoption in the first place. You can find our explanation of those issues in this research . Should that happen, Bitcoin’s unique regulatory clarity will likely make it even more competitive than other digital assets. Conversely, we believe a Trump presidency is generally bullish for the entire crypto ecosystem, as it would likely produce more deregulation and business-friendly policies - perhaps particularly so for crypto entrepreneurs, who regulators have increasingly scrutinized in the past four years. Regardless of the election outcome, the trend of growing fiscal deficits and rising national debt will likely continue. This suggests a weakening of the U.S. dollar, a macroeconomic environment in which Bitcoin has historically thrived. Decentralization: A Global Need Through a broader political lens, 2024 has seen escalating global efforts to police online speech, with growing implications for financial freedom. Australia's just- proposed Misinformation Bill is a prime example of how spreading information that undermines public confidence in the banking system could become illegal. Given that Australian banks have increasingly frozen customer accounts in recent years, this law raises the chilling possibility that if your bank freezes your account, discussing it could make you a criminal. This highlights how far-reaching and ambiguous such attempts to police misinformation can be. Similar laws have been passed in other countries, such as Brazil’s Fake News Bill, which led to the ban of X (formerly Twitter) in September 2024 due to the platform’s failure to meet transparency requirements. In Canada, platforms like Meta ( META ) have already blocked access to news in response to legislation. Privacy-focused platforms like Telegram are under scrutiny. After Telegram’s founder Pavel Durov was arrested in France, the platform updated its FAQ to reflect more aggressive content moderation policies and a potential new law enforcement reporting system. Country Bill Name Status Language That Policies Free Speech Practical Impact Date Passed Australia Misinformation Bill Proposed Speech causing ""harm to public confidence in the banking system"" is targeted. Fines up to 5% of global revenue. Potential to stifle legitimate debate. TBD Brazil PL 2630/2020 (Fake News Bill) Passed Platforms must remove ""harmful content"", especially around elections and public health.

Jun-23 UK Online Safety act Passed Platforms must remove ""harmful content"" and ensure age-appropriate experiences for children. Fines up to £18 million or 10% of global revenue. TikTok faced scrutiny over child safety. Jan-24 EU Digital Services Act (DSA) Passed Requires platforms to remove illegal content, including hate speech and ""disinformation"". Expanded in 2023 to cover Big Tech platforms (45M+ users), imposing fines of up to 6% of global revenue. Nov-22 Hong Kong Name Pending - Financial Services and Treasury Bureau AI Guidelines Framework In Preparation No specific language yet. However, Western AI models are reportedly unavailable. We think this is likely due to fears of uncensored (e.g., pro-democracy) LLM content emerging. Restricts access to unfettered information for those in HK, threatening competitiveness. Per a Bloomberg News report, most companies did not respond to queries on the topic, and only Google confirmed Gemini AI is unavailable. TBD Source: VanEck research as of 9/17/24. As Big Tech withdraws from key markets to avoid liability, the fragmentation of information and rising criticisms about “fake news” appear to be an inevitable result. Indeed, we argue that the ideological and political capture of centralized internet behemoths like Google threatens individuals’ access to credible and independent information. Earlier this year, when asked to generate historically accurate depictions of 18th-century British royalty, Google’s newly released AI produced images of Asian and Black kings. When asked to create an image of ""crypto programmers being bros in a sparse office,"" it refused, stating that the request furthered “harmful stereotypes” about ""brogrammers.” These walled garden AI offerings are not credible, and we believe there is considerable white space for open-source competitors to gain share, many of whom use crypto tokens to bootstrap their networks. Conclusion We believe Bitcoin's long-term growth is driven by powerful, enduring mega-themes: the rising need for decentralized, censorship-resistant networks, growing institutional adoption through ETPs and model portfolios, and increasing sovereign involvement in mining and cross-border trade. As inflation and currency devaluation continue challenging fiat monetary systems, bitcoin can serve as a vital hedge. Demographically, Bitcoin enjoys strong support from younger generations, positioning it to potentially benefit as Boomer wealth turns over. As these structural forces deepen, bitcoin’s role as a global reserve asset continues to strengthen, reinforcing our conviction that the long-term Bull Market is intact. Notes: Net unrealized profit/loss ratio (NUPL) can be calculated by subtracting the realized market cap from the market cap and dividing the result by the market cap. When a high percentage of Bitcoin’s market cap consists of unrealized profits, it can be interpreted that investors are greedy. Background reading here .

Index performance is not representative of fund performance. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Investments in digital assets and Web3 companies are highly speculative and involve a high degree of risk. These risks include, but are not limited to: the technology is new and many of its uses may be untested; intense competition; slow adoption rates and the potential for product obsolescence; volatility and limited liquidity, including but not limited to, inability to liquidate a position; loss or destruction of key(s) to access accounts or the blockchain; reliance on digital wallets; reliance on unregulated markets and exchanges; reliance on the internet; cybersecurity risks; and the lack of regulation and the potential for new laws and regulation that may be difficult to predict. Moreover, the extent to which Web3 companies or digital assets utilize blockchain technology may vary, and it is possible that even widespread adoption of blockchain technology may not result in a material increase in the value of such companies or digital assets. Digital asset prices are highly volatile, and the value of digital assets, and Web3 companies, can rise or fall dramatically and quickly. If their value goes down, there’s no guarantee that it will rise again. As a result, there is a significant risk of loss of your entire principal investment. Digital assets are not generally backed or supported by any government or central bank and are not covered by FDIC or SIPC insurance. Accounts at digital asset custodians and exchanges are not protected by SPIC and are not FDIC insured. Furthermore, markets and exchanges for digital assets are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections available in traditional equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange investing. Digital assets include, but are not limited to, cryptocurrencies, tokens, NFTs, assets stored or created using blockchain technology, and other Web3 products. Web3 companies include but are not limited to, companies that involve the development, innovation, and/or utilization of blockchain, digital assets, or crypto technologies. All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. As with any investment strategy, there is no guarantee that investment objectives will be met and investors may lose money.

33793812,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24172,1726842834,Is Ossification Good or Bad for Bitcoin?,"Bitcoin ossification refers to the process where changes to Bitcoin’s underlying protocol become increasingly difficult, potentially leading to a point where the protocol remains fixed and unchangeable. This concept is hotly debated within the Bitcoin community. Supporters of ossification argue that it is a sign of Bitcoin’s maturity and decentralisation, ensuring stability and protecting the network from untested or harmful changes. Critics, however, believe ossification may prevent necessary updates that could enhance Bitcoin’s scalability, security, or functionality. The debate revolves around whether Bitcoin has evolved enough to lock in its current form or whether further flexibility is needed for the protocol to adapt to future developments. The Debate Rages Over Making Changes to the Bitcoin Protocol Bitcoin protocol ossification refers to the point where changes to Bitcoin’s underlying code become extremely difficult or impossible to implement. As the first decentralised digital financial protocol, Bitcoin’s evolution has been gradual, with early changes happening relatively freely when fewer users and developers were involved. However, as Bitcoin has matured, its decentralised nature has made large-scale changes harder to coordinate, as consensus must be reached with an overwhelming majority of the community supporting any changes to the protocol. The concept of ossification suggests that, at a certain point, Bitcoin’s rules should be considered set in stone, much like a constitution, to ensure stability and decentralisation. The debate over whether Bitcoin has reached this stage is contentious within the community. Some argue that ossification is a positive sign of decentralisation, ensuring that no single entity or group can push through changes that may harm Bitcoin’s core principles, like decentralisation or security. This viewpoint stems from concerns over previous controversies, such as the Segwit2x fork , where some large actors attempted to force changes on the network. Proponents of ossification believe that locking in the protocol could protect Bitcoin from similar risks in the future, ensuring that it remains resilient against untested or detrimental upgrades. On the other hand, critics argue that ossification might come too soon, potentially preventing necessary updates that could enhance Bitcoin’s scalability, security, and functionality. While Bitcoin is robust, some believe that further improvements are still needed to address emerging challenges or to enable new use cases. These critics worry that if Bitcoin ossifies prematurely, it could become inflexible and unable to adapt to future technological advancements, which may limit its ability to serve the needs of a growing global user base. For a decentralised network like Bitcoin, ossification is a double-edged sword. It could provide the predictability and stability needed for long-term trust, particularly as institutional adoption increases. However, it may also stifle innovation and prevent Bitcoin from evolving alongside newer technologies. As Bitcoin moves forward, finding a balance between preserving its security and openness to change will be a critical challenge for the community. Join the discussion about Bitcoin Ossification on our Discord! Why Do Some Bitcoiners Oppose Ossification of the Bitcoin Protocol? The argument against Bitcoin protocol ossification primarily revolves around the risks it poses to innovation and adaptability. As Bitcoin matures and gains more users, the network becomes resistant to change due to its decentralised structure, making it difficult to reach consensus on protocol upgrades. While this stability ensures the security of users’ funds, critics warn that an ossified protocol may hinder Bitcoin’s ability to adopt new technologies and features, especially as competitors in the cryptocurrency space continue to innovate. This could lead to Bitcoin falling behind, both in terms of technological capabilities and market relevance. Ossification may also limit the network’s ability to address critical issues in the future. For example, security vulnerabilities or bugs, such as the block timestamp issue, will eventually require updates to prevent potential breakdowns. If Bitcoin becomes too rigid to implement necessary changes, it risks undermining trust in its long-term viability. Ossification could also prevent the adoption of important upgrades, such as those that enhance privacy or scaling solutions like Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proofs or improved smart contract functionality. Critics argue that resisting all protocol changes in the name of security could ultimately lead to stagnation. Another major concern is that ossification could stifle developer interest and participation in Bitcoin’s development. The slower pace of innovation within the network might deter talented developers from contributing, as they may prefer more flexible ecosystems where they can experiment with new ideas. This talent drain could further slow Bitcoin’s progress and make it harder for the network to keep up with advancements in cryptography, blockchain, and Decentralised Finance (DeFi). In the long term, this could impact Bitcoin’s competitiveness against more adaptable cryptocurrencies. Despite these challenges, proponents of ossification argue that Bitcoin’s primary value lies in its security and stability. They believe that frequent changes introduce risks that could undermine Bitcoin’s role as a reliable store of value. While innovation is important, they assert that Bitcoin’s core protocol should remain resistant to unnecessary modifications to preserve its decentralisation and robustness. However, finding a balance between maintaining security and allowing for necessary innovation is crucial if Bitcoin is to remain relevant in the space. In Favour of Ossification, Why Some Bitcoiners are Resistant to Change The argument for Bitcoin protocol ossification centres on the idea that stability and predictability are critical to Bitcoin’s long-term success as a decentralised, secure, and immutable store of value. Supporters of ossification argue that, unlike other cryptocurrencies which frequently undergo updates, forks, and changes, Bitcoin benefits from maintaining a rigid base layer. This ensures that the foundational rules of the network remain unchanged, providing users with confidence that the system they rely on today will be the same system in the future. This stability is seen as essential for maintaining Bitcoin’s role as “digital gold,” where minimising change is crucial to maintaining trust and security. A key reason for advocating ossification is the inherent risk associated with making protocol changes. Even with thorough testing, introducing new features or modifications can open up vulnerabilities or lead to unforeseen consequences, potentially compromising the network’s security. Bitcoin’s decentralised nature makes it challenging to correct issues once they are widespread, as consensus must be reached across the network. Advocates of ossification believe that reducing the frequency of changes minimises the potential for such risks, making the system more robust and reliable over time. Another significant argument in favour of ossification is that Bitcoin’s primary value proposition lies in its simplicity and decentralisation. Unlike altcoins that emphasise feature-rich ecosystems and rapid development, Bitcoin’s strength comes from its conservative design principles. By keeping the protocol minimal and avoiding complex changes, Bitcoin can maintain its decentralised nature, with no single group having too much influence over its direction. This helps ensure that Bitcoin remains resistant to centralisation pressures and governance failures, which have affected other blockchain projects that rely on frequent updates and more centralised decision-making processes. Finally, proponents of ossification highlight that while the base layer of Bitcoin may become rigid, innovation can still thrive on second-layer solutions and sidechains. Technologies like the Lightning Network and other sidechains, like Liquid Network can provide the flexibility and scalability that some users seek without compromising the core security and stability of the Bitcoin network. This layered approach allows Bitcoin to maintain its foundational role as a secure, immutable ledger while still allowing room for growth and experimentation on higher levels, preserving the balance between security and innovation.

33793334,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=643340,1726842644,Analyst Predicts A Solana Price Crash To $80 If This Happens,"Veteran crypto analyst, Peter Brandt has unveiled a new bearish forecast for Solana (SOL), predicting a massive price crash to new lows around $80. Despite this grim outlook, there remains a potential for a price recovery as other analysts foresee Solana jumping as high as $208. SOL Heading For $80 Price Crash As of writing, the price of Solana just hit $150, up from an initial value of $148 and successfully breaking past resistance levels around $149. This significant price increase represents an 8.49% surge, underscoring investors’ strong interest and demand for the altcoin. Related Reading: Dogecoin Forming First Golden Cross In 4 Years, Is A 3700% Rally To $3.8 Possible? Despite the recent bullish performance, Brandt has issued a bleak forecast for Solana, anticipating a steep 46.67% price crash in its price from current levels. The crypto analyst’s pessimistic prediction on X (formerly Twitter) is grounded on the possibility of Solana failing to break through key support levels. Brandt points out that if Solana’s price falls below the $129 support mark, and this support “gives way,” then a large rectangle pattern would be complete. This concluded rectangle could lead to a significant price drop, with a potential downward spiral to $80. Following his post, a crypto community member questioned Brandt on why he refers to the pattern as a rectangle, rather than a descending triangle. He also inquired if the wick of the July high was influencing his classification of this rectangle. Responding, Brandt clarified that the interpretation of whether it is a rectangle or a descending triangle depends on how the boundaries of the chart pattern are drawn. He stated that regardless of wicks, closing prices, real body and candle sticks, both shapes could lead to similar expectations in terms of price movements. In his Solana price chart, Brandt also noted a new resistance level around the $204 mark has emerged for the altcoin, suggesting a possibility for the cryptocurrency to reach that threshold. Moving forward, the implications of an $80 price decline for Solana would reflect a considerable downside risk that could be financially detrimental for investors. As Solana continues to navigate the volatile market, investors can monitor key changes in the cryptocurrency’s trajectory to make more informed investment decisions. Solana Price Decline To Spark $208 Rally While analysts like Brandt are anticipating a price crash for Solana, another market expert identified as ‘TraderXO’ on X has provided a more conservative price decline that would precede a major bull rally. Related Reading: Is This The End For Ethereum Or A Generational Opportunity? Essentially, TraderXO is bullish on the long-term outlook of Solana. The analyst revealed that the price of Solana could begin trading into the $120s again, declining from its present price of $150. However, the analyst revealed that he would be considering “longing again” around this declined level, anticipating a major bull run to $208 for the cryptocurrency. For this to happen, Solana will have to experience a significant 38.67% increase from its current price.

The firm upsized this week's convertible note offering to $1.01 billion principal amount from $700 million, and used the proceeds for the BTC acquisition.  Nasdaq-listed software company MicroStrategy (MSTR) said Friday that it purchased 7,420 bitcoin {{BTC}} for about $458.2 million using the proceeds of its debt offering. The acquisition happened between Sept. 13 and 19 at an average BTC price of approximately $61,750.

The company's bitcoin yield, a novel metric that measures the percentage change in the company's BTC holdings relative to its assumed fully diluted shares outstanding, increased to 5.1% for this quarter, up from 4.4% on September 13, company filings show.  The company, led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, has been a pioneer for bitcoin adoption as a corporate treasury asset, and has become the largest corporate holder of BTC since it started buying in 2020.  With the latest purchase, the firm now holds 252,220 bitcoin worth nearly $16 billion at current prices, acquiring at an average BTC price of $39,266 for a total cost of $9.9 billion.

Based on historical price patterns and market cycles, this projection has caused quite a stir in the crypto community. EGRAG disclosed his prognosis via X (formerly Twitter), representing various scenarios that can impact the course of XRP, bringing together aggressive and conservative price estimates. Related Reading: Cardano Goes Bullish On-Chain: Can ADA Price Catch Up? Fundamentally, his estimate is based on a critical price point: the current cycle bottom of XRP set at $0.28. According to EGRAG, the development of the token depends on this level. Should XRP maintain above it, we could see a big increase in value. From here, the analyst charts five possible price goals; the most cautious estimates a 932% rise. #XRP 5 Colors / 5 Scenarios – ⚪️🟡🔴🔵🟢 Choose Your Color!

Let’s dive into the colors and their pump potentials: ⚪️… pic.twitter.com/PBBOyEv1Hz — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 18, 2024 Five XRP Growth Scenarios Under EGRAG’s first scenario, XRP increases to $3, slightly under its all-time high of $3.31. This shows a significant comeback for the digital asset even though it would not set records. With a 1,563% price rise, the following scenario is more hopeful and would drive XRP to $4.85. This price would be the first time XRP surpassed its previous peak, marking a new high for the token. But it doesn’t stop there. EGRAG also predicts a 2,030% rise, which would send XRP soaring to $6.22. He then shows an even more ambitious 2,530% increase to $7.68. EGRAG claims that these higher targets could come true if XRP crosses what he refers to as the “actual wake-up line,” a crucial trendline in his study. If the altcoin keeps on its path of ascent, a possibility for more profits could materialize. XRP’s Steady Rise And Stability Notwithstanding these audacious forecasts, one of XRP’s most remarkable qualities in recent months has been its stability. For 2,650 days, XRP has maintained above a critical price level—referred to as the “Bifrost Bridge”—EGRAG notes. Solid market support is indicated by this flow, which EGRAG claims is an essential gauge of the value of the token. It has not exhibited indications of breaking down even in the face of market swings. #XRP Bifrost Bridge – 2,650 Days: The chart below is based on a 3-Month Time Frame and what’s fascinating is that the Bifrost Bridge is STILL holding strong for #XRP! 💪 This high time frame adds major weight and significance to what we’re seeing here! 🔥 For nearly 2,650… pic.twitter.com/teMKCrX4uF — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 19, 2024 Related Reading: Solana Active Addresses Hit 75 Million As SOL Breaches $140 XRP has been steadily rising since its 2017 debut, flitting through periods of uptrends and consolidation, the analyst said. He noted that the present phase is “quite bullish,” indicating more higher momentum. The fact that the coin withstands market volatility adds to its appeal. Bullish Sentiment And Long-Term Outlook EGRAG’s study’s most dramatic finding may be its most hopeful: a 9,468% price increase. If this happens, XRP might hit $27 per token. This estimate seems implausible, but EGRAG emphasizes that it is based on past pricing trends and uses only half of past wick measurements, keeping it grounded.

The Bitcoin mining industry faces economic challenges post-halving, with Cipher's hash cost currently at $43 per day, making operations unprofitable until rigs are upgraded. Despite a $1 billion market cap and a large Bitcoin stack, Cipher's valuation is mixed. Ongoing risks include dilution and insider selling. Given the current market conditions and risks, I believe CIFR is a hold, with better opportunities potentially found in Bitcoin ETFs. It has been nearly a year since I last covered Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) for Seeking Alpha. As we progress through 2024, it's becoming clear that the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining space is going through a consolidation. Some firms have been more active than others in acquisitions. Cipher has been an asset acquirer. Today, we find Cipher Mining in a much different financial position than when I last covered the stock. In this update, we'll look at Cipher's Q2 earnings, the health of the industry, recent production figures, and other considerations. Q2 Earnings & Balance Sheet For the quarter ended June, Cipher Mining reported $36.8 million in total revenue. All of which was derived from Bitcoin mining. Q2 revenue was down over 23% sequentially but up 18% year over year. 10-Q (Cipher Mining) Cost of revenue came down slightly both QoQ and YoY to $14.3 million. After COGS, SG&A, Depreciation, and changes in asset values, Cipher's net loss for the quarter comes in at ($16.2) million. The good news for bulls is the balance sheet is in a much healthier position than it was this time last year. Data by YCharts At the end of June, Cipher reported $122.6 million in cash & equivalents, $138 million in Bitcoin, $775.6 million in total assets and just $84.8 million in liabilities. Cipher has a hoard of capital that can be put to use to scale operations in either Bitcoin or HPC services. In August, the company agreed to spend $67.5 million of that capital on a 300 MW facility in Texas that it plans to use for growth. Of course, there's always a catch: Data by YCharts Shares outstanding have grown by over 29% in the last year as Cipher has generally looked to the ATM for capital. Dilution isn't necessarily bad if that dilution is accretive. However, Bitcoin mining is currently a very difficult business and higher BTC prices are needed to justify any planned expansion in that segment from where I sit. Mining Industry Health With BTC having gone essentially nowhere from a price standpoint over the last 6 months, the post-halving economic situation for miners is dubious. I've gone into greater detail in a recent article covering the Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF ( WGMI ) earlier this month. You can read that article for additional insights. For the benefit of this article, all you really need to see is this chart: Mining Hashprice (hashrateindex) This is dollar-denominated hashprice. I'm showing the 5 year trend in that figure. The reason why I like this metric is because it provides a USD number for miner revenue per PH/s per day. At roughly $40 today, that figure is at a 5 year low. This is a direct result of the halving from April. On the conference call, Cipher CEO Tyler Page noted the company's hash cost is about $43 per day. Thus, given current market economics, Cipher Mining can't profitably operate. However, Page mentioned that hash cost will be driven down below $30 following rig upgrades at Odessa. Cipher Production & HODL We can additionally see the impact of the April halving in Cipher Mining's monthly production trend. In the chart below, I'm showing the company's declining monthly BTC production even as Cipher scales exahash capacity: Monthly Production (Cipher, Author's Chart) Since the halving, CIFR is averaging approximately 170 BTC per month in block rewards. The result of this has been a slowing of the growth in the company's BTC stack held in treasury: Monthly HODL (Cipher, Author's Chart) As of August 2024, CIFR holds 2,284 BTC, worth approximately $144 million at a $63k BTC price as of article submission. CIFR has the 6th largest HODL stack of the public miners. Valuation At a hair above $1 billion in market capitalization, CIFR is the 7th largest Bitcoin miner in the public equity market. Three of the companies ahead of CIFR in that ranking have no meaningful position in Bitcoin on the balance sheet. Given CIFR's $144 million stack, there is theoretically more upside for CIFR than some of those peers in a more sustained BTC price rerating to the upside. From a traditional metric standpoint, CIFR's current valuation is mixed: Data by YCharts The company's 5.3x PS ratio is on the lower end compared to large industry peers like TeraWulf ( WULF ) or Marathon Digital ( MARA ). However, all of these companies in the chart above are priced well ahead of Info Tech sector median. Data by YCharts However, on a forward price to earnings multiple, the 11.1 PE offered by CIFR's current price is quite a bit more palatable than each of the other larger BTC miners in the chart above. Info Tech sector median for the metric is 23.5. Given each of these traditional valuation figures, CIFR is probably a ""buy."" But, I still can't quite get there. Risks: More Dilution & Insider Sales As I alluded earlier, the company's financials are in a far more advantageous position than a year ago. Cipher Mining has raised a large amount of capital to fund growth initiatives in both BTC mining and HPC services. Even with the Fed cutting rates 50 bps in September, it appears as though equity dilution will continue to be the avenue Cipher Mining goes for growth funding. In early September, Cipher Mining announced an automatic shelf offering of up to $600 million. Per the prospectus , the offering will result in 458,304,772 shares of CIFR stock after of 129,688,346 share. Given the 328,616,426 shares at the end of June, the shelf will result in additional dilution of nearly 40%. CIFR Sales (OpenInsider) An additional risk to consider is the insider selling trend over the last few months. Major CIFR owner Bitfury has been selling shares in roughly 1 million share blocks regularly going back to late May. The most recent sale was a 5% reduction in holdings. Investor Takeaways To summarize the overall point today; CIFR shareholders are battling insider selling, more dilution, and rough mining economics for the company's only real revenue segment at this point time. If the price of Bitcoin goes up, it will likely benefit CIFR as well. But the more straightforward way to express that opinion would be to just buy the ETFs instead. HPC services could bear fruit, but that is a very competitive space already with most of CIFR's peers also pivoting to similar business lines. One could possibly argue most of the risks have been priced in given the company's valuation relative to mining peers. But for me personally, I think CIFR is still a hold.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4722264-cipher-minings-capital-hoard-q2-earnings-cifr-stock-bitcoin-crypto?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/33790654.jpeg

42390341,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcUeHj,1726834120,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Tests $64K as BoJ Pauses Rate Hikes,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,000.30 +3.89%  Bitcoin (BTC): $63,503.69 +1.57%  Ether (ETH): $2,544.28 +4.77%  S&P 500: 5,713.64 +1.7%  Gold: $2,611.84 +0.95%  Nikkei 225: 37,723.91 +1.53%  Top Stories  Bitcoin rose above $64,000 during the Asian morning as the Bank of Japan kept rates unchanged in a positive signal for risk assets. It subsequently pared some of its gains to settle around $63,500, 1.9% higher in the last 24 hours.The BoJ's move avoided a repeat of its rate hike in July, which caused a slide in crypto markets. Traders observed that macroeconomic data is a source of optimism for riskier assets like BTC. “The US 2Y/10Y treasury spread, an indicator of recession, has been inverted since July 2022 but has recently steepened to +8bps,” QCP Capital traders said in a market broadcast Friday. “This reflects market optimism and a shift towards risk-on assets.”  Ether may be about to shine after underperforming against the wider crypto market this year, according to a new report by Steno Research. ETH has gained around 8% this year, compared with BTC's 40%. However, ether's performance during the last bull market could provide some clues as to what to expect now. ETH surged thanks to greater onchain activity from DeFi, stablecoin issuance and NFTs. The Federal Reserve interest-rate cut earlier this week will result in increased onchain activity, which will strongly benefit Ethereum, Steno said. ""Ethereum's active addresses remain strong, particularly when factoring in the growing adoption of rollups,"" analyst Mads Eberhardt wrote, adding that the network's transactional revenue looks to have bottomed in August.  More than 250 ""Satoshi era"" BTC moved on Friday, in a rare instance of bitcoin mined in the cryptocurrency's early days becoming active. The Satoshi era refers to the period between 2009 and 2011, when bitcoin's pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto was active in the community before disappearing. The bitcoin were transferred in transactions of 50 BTC to new wallets during the European morning, on-chain tracker Whale Alerts flagged on X. Several ""Satoshi era"" bitcoin have been active in the past few years. In July 2023, a wallet dormant for 11 years transferred $30 million worth of the asset to other wallets, and in August, another wallet transferred 1,005 BTC to a new address.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the correlation between BTC's price and the Bitcoin hashrate.  The extreme divergence of a 30-day correlation at -50% suggests the two could be set to converge, either through the price rising higher or the hashrate moving lower.

42390350,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcUerd,1726833666,"Bitcoin, Gold May Be Sensing Monetary Debasement as Records Beckon","Bitcoin has surged 7% in the past five days, breaking through $64,000 for the first time this month.  Gold has hit all-time highs, surpassing $2,600 an ounce.  These standout performances are linked to increased global liquidity, with expanding global central bank balance sheets and the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut stimulating investment and economic activity.  In the past five days, bitcoin {{BTC}} has surged 7%, breaking through $64,000 for the first time since Aug. 26. Gold, for its part, has reached all-time highs on over 30 occasions this year, topping $2,600 an ounce. These remarkable performances mark the first time since bitcoin's inception in 2009 that both are the top-performing assets of the year, according to Charlie Bilello, the chief market strategist at Creative Planning, an investment management and financial planning firm.  Year-to-date, gold has risen 27%, surpassing its 2020 performance of 25%. The last time it did better was 2007. What is driving this impressive rise?  Gold has historically been seen as a hedge against monetary debasement and global uncertainty, and current economic conditions suggest it is again fulfilling this role. The recent surge in gold prices can be attributed to these factors. Notably, gold began its rally before the significant monetary debasement triggered by the Covid pandemic in 2020, while bitcoin emerged as a star performer in late 2020 and into 2021. With bitcoin now just 14% away from its all-time high, is it playing catch-up once again?  A closer examination reveals that bitcoin's price tends to move in line with the Federal Reserve's net liquidity metric. This measure, calculated by subtracting reverse repo and the Treasury General Account from the Fed's balance sheet, indicates that bitcoin tends to follow liquidity trends.  Both bitcoin and net liquidity bottomed out toward the end of 2022, coinciding with the FTX collapse. Since then, bitcoin has steadily risen alongside an increase in net liquidity, which now exceeds $6 trillion.  The Federal Reserve's balance sheet is currently at $7.1 trillion, and although it is still engaging in quantitative tightening, the pace has slowed. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March 2023 led to a $1.6 trillion reduction in the balance sheet, bringing it back to levels seen during the initial phases of quantitative easing in response to the pandemic.  The draining of reverse repo balances, now just over $300 billion, releases liquidity back into the financial system. This is stimulative, increasing the availability of funds for lending, investment, and overall economic activity.  Looking more broadly, the combined balance sheets of the world's 15 largest central banks – including the U.S., European Union, Japan and China – approach $31 trillion.  While this number alone is not the focus, the trend shows a global resurgence in central bank balance sheets from about $30 trillion in July. This increase in liquidity is particularly stimulative for bitcoin, which tends to mirror liquidity trends.  Adding to this, just Wednesday the Fed cut the interest rate by 50 basis points, further supporting the rise of bitcoin and gold.

While both assets remain market leaders, recent developments have shown signs of potential resistance and consolidation. Amidst this, GoodEgg (GEGG) has emerged as a rising star, joining the exclusive club of cryptocurrencies boasting a 13,000% rally during its presale. Bitcoin’s Resistance Level Ahead of Fed Decision Bitcoin (BTC) has been on a rollercoaster ride in recent weeks. Following a dip below $60,000, BTC has struggled to regain its footing, with experts warning of potential resistance ahead of the Federal Reserve’s impending decision on interest rates. BTC’s price is hovering around $59,596.54, reflecting a -1.17% decrease compared to the previous day. Analysts believe that Bitcoin is likely to face significant hurdles as it approaches the $60,000 mark, which could act as a strong resistance level in the short term. Hemi Labs’ recent announcement of a $15 million funding round to develop a modular blockchain network for Bitcoin and Ethereum adds an interesting dynamic to the current landscape. Hemi Labs’ plan to integrate BTC with Ethereum’s smart contracts could potentially bridge the gap between these two giants, offering a new avenue for decentralized finance (DeFi) users. This innovation may provide some much-needed support for Bitcoin, but the market remains cautious until further developments unfold. Ethereum’s Range-Bound Movement Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) has been relatively range-bound, trading within a tight window. ETH recently dropped -1.65%, settling at $2,302.27, as market volatility takes its toll. The Ethereum community is eagerly awaiting updates from the Fed, as any positive news could trigger a breakout from its current consolidation phase. Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum is also benefiting from Hemi Labs’ technological advances. The start-up’s plan to launch a blockchain that allows Ethereum’s smart contracts to communicate directly with BTC could push ETH beyond its current limitations. However, for now, Ethereum remains stuck in a tight range, and many analysts believe that ETH needs to break through its $2,350 resistance level to spark any meaningful rally. GoodEgg’s 13,000% Rally Despite Market Instability While Bitcoin and Ethereum are currently grappling with market volatility, GoodEgg (GEGG) is turning heads with its astonishing presale performance. In its second stage, GoodEgg has raised $515,874, with 66.20% of the presale already sold. Currently priced at $0.00021 USDT, GEGG has gained a whopping 13,000% since its initial presale launch. GoodEgg’s innovative AI-powered platform sets it apart from other meme-based coins, and it is rapidly gaining attention as a must-watch crypto asset. Investors are increasingly looking towards GoodEgg (GEGG) for its potential to sustain long-term growth, similar to what early adopters of Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced. With Bitcoin and Ethereum facing critical resistance points, GoodEgg (GEGG) continues to rise in popularity and value, making it one of the standout tokens of 2024. Market Reaches Key Crossroad As the Federal Reserve’s decision looms, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) find themselves at crucial junctures. BTC is battling to reclaim the $60,000 mark, while ETH remains range-bound. Meanwhile, GoodEgg (GEGG) has already broken through with an impressive presale rally, signaling its potential as a key player in the crypto market.

POPCAT reached a $1 billion market cap, MOG has surged 70% in two weeks due to strong social media backing, and CAT, linked to Simon's Cat comics, saw $145 million in trading volume in the last 24 hours.  Analysts predict continued growth in memecoins, fueled by anticipated liquidity increases and bullish market sentiment, potentially leading to a boom similar to previous cycles.  Cat-themed memecoins aren’t just meowing but roaring back in an indication of risk-on sentiment starting to return to the broader crypto market.  Tokens such as Solana-based POPCAT, cat in a dog’s world (MEW), Ethereum-based MOG, and BNB Chain-based Simon’s Cat (CAT) have climbed up to 40% in a one-week period, with a bulk of gains coming since Wednesday when the U.S. Federal Reserve cut rates by 50 basis points for the first time in four years - fuelling prices of risk assets, including bitcoin {{BTC}}.  Popcat, a token tied to a meme of a cat with its mouth popped open, is nearing $1 billion market cap. Culture coin mog has jumped 70% in the past two weeks amid its strong cult following on social platforms, where the community often replies to posts with “mogging” and “mogged” to improve its visibility.  The newly released CAT has quickly climbed to become one of the biggest cat memes, seeing over $145 million in exchange bets in the past 24 hours. The token is officially tied to the Simon’s Cat comic series.  Since early 2023, meme tokens have been increasingly seen as a leveraged way to bet on the growth of their underlying blockchains, and crypto traders refer to them as beta bets.  Cat-themed tokens have emerged as a new cohort alongside dog-themed Dogecoin {{DOGE}} and Shiba Inu (SHIB), among the biggest gainers in the 2020-2021 bull run.  Their relatively smaller total market capitalization makes cat memes a stronger attraction than their dog-themed counterparts: The dog memes sector tracked by CoinGecko shows a 4% average gain in the past 24 hours, compared to a 14% bump on cat tokens.  Some market makers expect memecoins, alongside alternative tokens, to continue surging in the coming months.  ""Memecoins are experiencing a surge largely due to the anticipation of increased liquidity following the Federal Reserve's recent 0.5% interest rate cut,” Alex Andryunin, founder of Gotbit Hedge Fund, known for backing memecoinds, said in a message to CoinDesk. “Market expectations for lower rates have converged, and with the prospect of more liquidity entering the financial system, investors are adopting a bullish sentiment.”  “We anticipate that the memecoin market could grow significantly over the next two months.

With this breakout, BNB bulls are setting their sights on the $605 resistance level, as market sentiment strengthens around the potential for further gains. The move above the 100-day SMA has sparked optimism, hinting at the possibility of a sustained rally as BNB looks to capitalize on this momentum and break through key price targets. The goal of this analysis is to highlight BNB’s recent surge above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and evaluate the potential for continued positive movement toward the $605 resistance level. By examining current market dynamics and technical signals, this analysis aims to provide insight into whether BNB can maintain its upward momentum and achieve a significant breakout in the coming sessions. Rallying Strength: Analyzing BNB’s Surge Above The 100-Day SMA On the 4-hour chart, BNB has demonstrated sustained positive momentum after successfully breaking above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This significant breach has not only triggered a shift in market sentiment but set the stage for a bullish trajectory as BNB rises toward the $605 mark. BNB’s ability to maintain above this key technical level reflects growing confidence among traders, suggesting that the upward movement may continue. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart has climbed above the 50% threshold, currently sitting at 69%. This upward movement in the RSI indicates that bulls are firmly in control, as the index approaches overbought territory. If selling pressure remains subdued, there is potential for an extended increase in BNB’s price, signaling a strong bullish trend ahead. Related Reading: BNB Weekly Active Addresses Surge Over 6% – Is A Rally On The Way? On the daily chart, BNB is maintaining an upswing toward the $605 resistance level while trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The price has printed multiple candlesticks above this key indicator, underscoring the strong buying pressure from investors and indicating a solid sentiment in BNB’s potential for continued growth. Finally, on the 1-day chart, a careful examination of the formation of the 1-day RSI reveals that BNB could sustain its bullish trend toward the $605 resistance mark as the signal line of the indicator has risen above 50% and is currently attempting a move towards the 70% threshold. What’s Next For BNB As Resistance Beckons With strong buying interest and positive market sentiment, BNB is gearing up to reach the $605 resistance level. When BNB breaks above this point, it could lead to more gains, aiming for the $635 resistance zone and beyond. Related Reading: BNB Price Struggles to Hold $500: Is a Breakout Coming? However, the altcoin may face a pullback toward the $537 support mark if the momentum falters and fails to surpass this level.

At the time of writing, BNB was trading at approximately $575, reflecting a 3.05% increase over the past day. Its market capitalization was around $84 billion, with trading volume surpassing $1.9 million, showing increases of 3.05% and 9.81%, respectively.

33786637,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=643341,1726826444,Here’s Why A Green September Close Is Important For The Bitcoin Price,"Bitcoin is currently exhibiting bullish price action that has sparked optimism among crypto investors. The cryptocurrency recently broke above the psychological $60,000 price barrier after three weeks of acting as a dreaded resistance level. Since breaking past $60,000, Bitcoin has continued the run-up and has increased by 9.8% in the past seven days. Interestingly, the crypto is up by 20% from its lowest point of $52,827 this month. This price increase comes at a critical point for Bitcoin, as September has always been a make-or-break month for Bitcoin’s price performance in the fourth quarter of the year. According to price data from Coinglass, a green close in September has been a precursor to strong performance in October, November, and December. Historical Trends And The Importance Of A Green September A ‘green’ September refers to Bitcoin closing the month in profit or with an overall price increase from its opening on the first day of the month. Over the span of Bitcoin’s 12-year history, the cryptocurrency has seen eight ‘red’ Septembers, where prices closed lower than they started the month. In contrast, only three Septembers have ended in green. However, these rare instances of a green close have consistently led to strong rallies in the subsequent months of October, November, and December. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Crypto Pundit Predicts Historical 9,468% Pump To $27 The first instance of a green September came in 2015 when Bitcoin managed to close with a modest 2.35% gain. This seemingly small victory set the stage for gains in the months that followed, with Bitcoin surging 33.49% in October, 19.27% in November, and 13.83% in December. The latest green September occurred not too long ago in 2023. This led to a significant bull run and green monthly candles for the subsequent six months, culminating in Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high in March 2024. What To Expect From The Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $63,640. Bitcoin has witnessed an influx of investments in the past few days, which in turn has flowed into other cryptocurrencies. The entire crypto market cap now stands at $2.21 billion, which is an 8.33% increase in seven days. Related Reading: Is This The End For Ethereum Or A Generational Opportunity? Notably, the increase in cryptocurrency prices is mostly due to the United States Federal Reserve’s decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points. The move, which was the first rate cut in over a year, is deemed to be more favorable for risky assets like Bitcoin. Looking ahead, further rate cuts are expected in the coming months. According to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, investors are currently on a 100% possibility of another rate cut in the next Fed meeting held on November 7. This outlook bodes well for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, as continued rate cuts could lead to sustained upward price momentum. Crypto investors can look forward to months of positive price action for Bitcoin, with the next targets being breakouts above $65,000, $67,000, and $70,000.

42390356,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcUvp5,1726821683,"Ether Is Going to Shine Again, Steno Research Says","Ether's recent underperformance may be over, Steno Research said in a report.  The report noted that in the last bull market, during altcoin season, ether more than doubled in value compared to bitcoin.  The U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate cut will result in more onchain activity, which will benefit Ethereum.  Ether's {{ETH}} recent bout of underperformance may be over and the world's second largest cryptocurrency could be ready to shine again, both in fiat terms and relative to bitcoin {{BTC}}, Steno Research said in a report on Thursday.  The native token of the Ethereum blockchain has risen nearly 8% year-to-date, while bitcoin has surged 43% and the CoinDesk 20 index (CD20) has gained nearly 11%.  Ether's performance in the last bull market could provide some guidance. ETH surged during the last altcoin season, and in under two months it more than doubled in value compared to bitcoin, the report noted.  This shift was sparked by a surge in onchain activity, the report said, including decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoin issuance, and the boom in non-fungible tokens (NFTs), all of which happened mainly on the Ethereum blockchain.  The Federal Reserve interest rate cut, earlier this week, will result in increased onchain activity, which will strongly benefit Ethereum, Steno said.  Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are unlikely to continue outperforming ether versions as much, Steno said, noting that ETH has shown its ability to suddenly outperform its larger rival in the past.  There have been three main reasons for bitcoin's recent outperformance over ether. ""The impact of U.S. spot ETFs for both bitcoin and ether, the persistent buying pressure from MicroStrategy (MSTR), and a notable decline in Ethereum's transactional revenue in recent months,"" analyst Mads Eberhardt wrote.  ""Ethereum's active addresses remain strong, particularly when factoring in the growing adoption of rollups,"" Eberhardt wrote, adding that the network's transactional revenue looks to have bottomed in August.  Asset manager Bitwise is also bullish about ether's prospects. The cryptocurrency is potentially a contrarian bet into the year-end, it said in a report on Tuesday.

The fully new client, Firedancer, is running on testnet, a sign it's on the way to maturity.  SINGAPORE — An early version of Jump Crypto's highly anticipated Solana validator, Firedancer, is live and contributing to the performance of the Solana blockchain, Jump's Chief Science Officer Kevin Bowers said Friday.  Speaking onstage at Solana's Breakpoint conference, Bowers shed light on an ""open secret"" in Solana's validator community: Some of the computing power underpinning Solana is running ""Frankendancer"" software that combines predominant validator tech with new contributions from Jump.  Blockchain validators ingest transactions and construct blocks – the most essential process in running a blockchain. Most networks have a single validator client. Solana's plan to have two fully independent validators – one from a Solana spinoff team, Anza, one from Jump – would give it a redundancy boost, and potentially a performance edge, too.  Such behind-the-scenes and in-the-weeds tech developments might seem like a yawner, but at Breakpoint it received top billing. The sellout conference's largest stage was standing room only as Bowers emerged to a rockstar-like atmosphere.  ""We view this project as the consumer science equivalent of civil engineering,"" Bowers said of the effort to build the second validator client. He compared the potential impact of Firedancer as akin to expanding a country road into an interstate highway.  Bowers shed little light on when Firedancer – the fully new client software, as opposed to Frankendancer – would come online. But it is running on testnet, Bowers said, indicating it has achieved minimum viability and is getting close.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | SOL | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/09/20/jumps-frankendancer-validator-client-is-live-on-solana-mainnet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/438a3d0145ad0da44d899930095c6f7fbd9de775-4140x2329.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

SOL’s price broke above a key resistance level, reigniting the bullish sentiment among investors and traders who believe the cryptocurrency is soon poised to reclaim higher targets. Related Reading: October To Remember: Descending Broadening Wedge Says Bitcoin Is Going To $90,000 Solana Breaks Above Key Resistance Level Following the highly anticipated US Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts, the crypto market rebounded 5% in the last 24 hours. Most cryptocurrencies have registered green numbers in the past day, recovering from their performance in the past few weeks. Solana, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, regained momentum on Thursday after reclaiming a key level. The token had failed to break about the $140 resistance level throughout September, consolidating between the $130-$139 price range in the last few weeks. SOL had registered a 7% weekly drop by Wednesday, which alarmed many investors and market watchers. Some crypto analysts considered the token’s recent performance hinted at a possible correction that could drive the token’s price to a yearly low. Seasoned trader Peter Brandt suggested that the cryptocurrency could face a significant correction to the $80 support zone if it unsuccessfully continued retesting this resistance level. Nonetheless, SOL’s price recovered from its disappointing performance, jumping over 10% in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency moved past the $140 mark on Thursday morning, breaking out of a two-month downtrend. The price surge represented a 5.4% and 8.3% increase in the weekly and biweekly timeframes. Additionally, its daily market activity soared 81.3% in the past day, with a daily trading volume of $3.76 billion. Experts Set Next Targets For SOL Some analysts highlighted Solana’s performance, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is ready to aim for higher targets. Crypto analyst Jelle stated that, in the higher timeframes, Solana has performed considerably better than most altcoins. Other market watchers previously noted Solana’s strength since Q3 started. During the market retraces, the cryptocurrency was deemed “one of the strongest assets” after moving sideways while other tokens made new lows. Jelle highlighted that SOL’s price still held “all key support levels even though most altcoins are down >50% from the highs.” Effectively, Solana has remained above the $120 support zone since March, currently being 31% down from March’s highs. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Bullish Swing Continue? Top Analyst Says Yes Similarly, crypto analyst Yuriy considers SOL’s recent performance has set the stage for a breakout above the $150 resistance level. However, he warned that bulls must hold the $138 mark, as failing to maintain this support could lead to a correction to the $120 level. The analyst believes a successful breakout will send SOL’s price to the $160 resistance zone next, potentially moving toward the $180-200 targets. As of this writing, SOL is trading at $143.3, a 12.2% increase in the last 24 hours.

The Solana debut will test whether crypto users have any appetite for Euro-linked stablecoins on a faster and cheaper network, two attributes SG Forge touted in a press release. CEO Jean-Marc Stenger said in the presser that Solana's speed ""will unlock new possibilities for both retail users and institutional players in"" decentralized finance (DeFi).

33779629,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=643237,1726810204,Will Bitcoin Break Through $70k? Short-Term Holders’ Buy Price Holds The Key,"Recent CryptoQuant analysis suggests that short-term Bitcoin holders’ average buy price could be a key factor in predicting the leading crypto’s future movements. The focus is on holders who have had Bitcoin for months, with historical data indicating that their average buy price often serves as a critical support or resistance level. These short-term holders’ buy prices have been linked to significant shifts in Bitcoin’s market direction. Related Reading: BREAKING: Fed Cuts Rates—Bitcoin And Markets React With A Bang How Short-Term Holders Buy Price Hints At Future Move The analysis, provided by an analyst under the pseudonym ‘Avocado Onchain,’ draws attention to the historical instances where Bitcoin’s price either broke through or was rejected by the average buy price of these short-term holders. The analyst points out that monitoring this average buy price could offer insights into Bitcoin’s potential future trends. According to the data presented, the average buy price of Bitcoin holders who have held their assets for 1-3 months has repeatedly influenced the cryptocurrency’s price direction. When Bitcoin’s price successfully breaks through this average buy price, it often leads to a notable bullish trend. Conversely, when the average buy price acts as a resistance point, it can signal the beginning of a bearish phase. An example highlighted by Avocado was when Bitcoin reached $73,000 earlier this year and then saw subsequent declines. According to the analyst, at that time, Bitcoin failed to surpass the average buy price of these short-term holders, leading to a bearish trend afterward. This pattern suggests that the average buy price of short-term holders can serve as a reliable on-chain metric for assessing market sentiment. As Bitcoin’s price approaches these levels, it tends to face critical tests of momentum, which can either confirm or redirect the prevailing market trend. Bitcoin Rally To $70k Approaching? Bitcoin is now seeing a gradual push towards the upside following the announced US fed rate cut yesterday. In the past day alone, the asset has surged by 5.8% with a current trading price of $63,054. Avocado noted: With the recent announcement of a 50bp rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve, Bitcoin is once again attempting to break through the average buy price of 1-3 month holders. Although it remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will eventually break through the short-term holder buy price level thereby resulting in further bullish momentum, analysts in the crypto space have shared their optimistic outlook on the crypto.

XRP Price Eyes More Upsides XRP price remained well-supported above $0.5700 and started a fresh increase like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price was able to clear the $0.580 and $0.5850 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed the price above the $0.5920 resistance zone. However, they failed to push the price toward $0.60.

The 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5622 swing low to the $0.5941 high is acting as a support.

The first major resistance is near the $0.5920 level. The next key resistance could be $0.600. A clear move above the $0.600 resistance might send the price toward the $0.6160 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.6250 resistance or even $0.6350 in the near term. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5880 resistance zone, it could start another decline.

33777505,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=643278,1726804812,"This Solana Memecoin Climbs 36%, On The Verge Of Reaching $1 And Record Highs","The excitement surrounding memecoins is making a notable comeback as Solana-based tokens outperform larger cryptocurrencies, particularly following the recent announcement from the Federal Reserve regarding interest rate cuts. Among the standout performers is Popcat (POPCAT), which has experienced a remarkable 36% spike in just 24 hours, bringing the token close to its all-time high achieved in July of this year, underscoring the renewed enthusiasm for memecoins amidst changing economic conditions. Popcat Records Nearly 100% Gain In A Month On Wednesday, NewsBTC reported that the Federal Reserve announced its first rate cut in four years, reducing the federal funds rate by 0.50 percentage points. This adjustment marks a significant shift since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, lowering the target range to 4.75%–5%, down from 5.25%–5.5%. These rates were the highest seen since 2001, and the decision is seen as a bullish signal for the broader market, suggesting potential price increases shortly, even as volatility is expected. Related Reading: Is This The End For Ethereum Or A Generational Opportunity? In response to this news, Solana saw nearly a 10% surge in the last 24 hours, edging closer to the $150 mark after successfully reclaiming key support levels. This momentum has fostered renewed confidence in tokens built on the Solana network, exemplified by Popcat’s performance. Currently trading at $0.918, Popcat is now just 7% shy of its all-time high of $0.993 reached two months ago. The latest increase coincides with a staggering 236% rise in trading volume, nearing the $200 million mark within just 48 hours, according to CoinGecko data. Looking at longer time frames, Popcat has demonstrated significant growth, recording a 44% increase over the past week and a 62% rise over the last two weeks. This translates to nearly a 100% gain in the past month, particularly striking compared to larger cryptocurrencies that have faced losses following significant market downturns on August 5 and September 6. Key Levels To Watch For The Solana-Based POPCAT Despite the uptrend recorded, POPCAT encountered challenges in maintaining its momentum earlier today. The token reached a daily high of $0.936 but struggled to consolidate above a critical resistance level at $0.939 on its POPCAT/USDT daily chart. This resistance has emerged as one of the last significant hurdles for Popcat before it can approach its all-time highs recorded in July. Should the token break through this barrier, the next resistance level is $0.971. Not surpassing both levels could lead to a brief phase of consolidation, which may be necessary for the token to gain the strength required to push further upward. However, if the current uptrend loses momentum, the inability to break these resistance levels could hinder Popcat’s progress. Related Reading: A Record $21.77 Billion In Bitcoin Shorts Will Be Liquidated Once BTC Breaks $70,500 On the downside, bullish investors should closely monitor the $0.834 level, as it serves as the nearest support floor for the memecoin. It could indicate a potential correction if the price falls below this support. In such a scenario, the next support level on the daily chart is significantly lower at $0.72. If the price reaches this level, it would represent a considerable decline of approximately 21% from its current trading price of $0.918.

33775403,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=643213,1726799444,Crypto Analyst: Bull Market Hinges On This Indicator Reaching 45%,"In a detailed post on X, crypto analyst Jamie Coutts outlined various indicators he monitors to gauge when the market might pick up bullish momentum. Crypto Market Might Be In The Final Stage Of The Bearish Phase Coutts, Chief Crypto Analyst at the financial knowledge and education platform RealVision, noted that the cryptocurrency market has gradually declined. The top 200 equal-weight index (EWI) shows that the leading 200 cryptocurrencies by market cap have experienced a 55% pullback over the past six months. Despite this downward trajectory, Coutts believes the risk/reward ratio is favorable for adding select digital assets at current levels. Related Reading: Ethereum ETFs Launch About To Kickstart The Altseason? Analysts Weigh In Coutts highlighted the steep surge in the alt season indicator, a data point that measures the degree by which altcoins outperform Bitcoin (BTC). However, this rise is not accompanied by a sustained Bitcoin rally, which requires its price to be above its all-time-high (ATH) value. As a result, the upward-moving altseason indicator may be short-lived. Still, Coutts suspects the market is “in the final throes of the bearish thrust.” The analyst emphasized that even when altcoins outperform BTC in terms of price, investing in them may not always be wise if they are still in a downward trend. Coutts recalled a similar situation in 2022, during the collapse of the FTX exchange. He suggests that the ideal time to invest in altcoins is when they are trending upward not only on the absolute price chart but also on the relative price chart. This Indicator Must Hit 45% For Bull Market To Resume According to Coutts, one key metric to determine whether the market has entered bullish territory is the percentage of digital assets above their 200-day moving average (MA). Currently, only 11% of digital assets are above the 200-day MA. For a bull market to resume, at least 45% of digital assets must be above this level. For the uninitiated, the 200-day MA is a technical analysis indicator that represents the average price of an asset over the past 200 trading days. Traders and analysts use it to identify the long-term trend of an asset, including digital assets like BTC. Related Reading: Altcoins Season: Analyst Predicts 2x Surge Post-Bitcoin Rally Despite the recent market downturn, certain fundamental metrics within the crypto ecosystem, such as daily active users (DAU), daily transactions, and network value-to-fee ratio, have increased in the past six months. Further, daily fees are down 84%, a decrease that can be attributed to the implementation of EIP-4844, which slashed transaction fees for Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem users. Coutts added that a bull market could be on the horizon when prices and fees begin to trend upward together. “We’re not there yet, but prices will lead, and fees will naturally follow,” he noted. As of press time, the total crypto market cap, excluding BTC, is $879.676 billion.

Bitcoin Has Recovered Back Above The $63,000 Level Following the news of the US Federal Reserve cutting back on interest rates, Bitcoin has responded positively, with its price breaking above the $63,000 level. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Bullish Swing Continue? Top Analyst Says Yes The chart below shows what the asset’s recent performance has looked like. The graph shows that after this 5% jump over the last 24 hours, the cryptocurrency is no longer far from reaching the highest level observed in August. As is generally the case, the rest of the digital asset sector has also enjoyed a surge as this latest Bitcoin rally has occurred. Some of the altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) have even managed to notably outperform the number one coin. A consequence of all the volatility in the market has been that the derivatives side has gone through some chaos. Crypto Derivatives Market Has Observed $201 Million In Liquidations Today According to data from CoinGlass, a large amount of liquidations have occurred in the cryptocurrency derivatives market during the last 24 hours. “Liquidation” here refers to the forceful closure that any open contract undergoes after amassing a certain percentage of loss. Here is a table that breaks down the data related to liquidations in the sector over the past day: As displayed above, the cryptocurrency market as a whole has seen more than $201 million in liquidations during the last 24 hours. Out of these, about $147 million of the flush has involved short contracts. This means the short investors were responsible for almost three-fourths of the total liquidations. This is natural because Bitcoin and other assets have seen a significant surge during this period. A mass liquidation event like today is popularly known as a “squeeze.” As the latest squeeze has mainly involved the shorts, it would be called a short squeeze. Events like these aren’t particularly rare in cryptocurrency because most coins can act volatilely and speculation is generally quite active. Compounded by the fact that many speculators aren’t afraid to touch leverage, large liquidations can easily occur. Related Reading: Dogecoin Miners In Accumulation Mode, But Is This Really Bullish? As for how the latest squeeze has looked regarding the contribution from the individual symbols, the heat map below reveals it. As is the norm, Bitcoin has topped the charts with $78 million in liquidations, more than twice the $36 million Ethereum registered in second place. Solana has seen the most liquidations of the rest at $11 million.

This surge has sparked increased interest from both retail traders and institutional players, leading to diverse positioning within the market. Divergence In Trader Strategies According to a recent post on social media site X (formerly Twitter) by technical analyst InspoCrypto, the recent price action on the Binance BTC/USDT perpetual futures chart highlights a strong upward trend, with Bitcoin breaking key resistance levels around $60,000. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Will Surge 1,000% Past ATH – Price Targets Revealed The volume accompanying this price rise remains robust, according to the analyst, indicating solid support for the ongoing bullish movement. InspoCrypto suggests that while the market is currently in a bullish phase with no immediate signs of reversal, potential resistance is anticipated around $64,000 to $65,000. Insights from Hyblock Capital’s heatmap, reveal significant differences in positioning between large traders (whales) and retail investors. The heatmaps show an increase in long positions among retail traders, particularly in the $62,500 to $63,500 range. In contrast, whales have been accumulating short positions below $60,000, suggesting a cautious sentiment among institutional players despite the short-term optimism among retail investors toward the largest cryptocurrency on the market. Bitcoin Faces Key Liquidation Levels At $60,000 And $64,000 InspoCrypto further highlights that open interest in the futures market has also been rising along with the Bitcoin price, especially in the $62,000 to $63,500 range, indicating growing confidence in the bullish trend. In addition, the current funding rate is positive, suggesting that long positions are prevalent and traders are willing to pay a premium to maintain those positions. However, the analyst cautions that a sustained high funding rate could lead to market corrections as traders rebalance their positions. Related Reading: Is This The End For Ethereum Or A Generational Opportunity? Volume remains a critical indicator of market strength, supporting the bullish rally as it surpasses the $63,000 mark. Notably, the volume delta is positive, indicating more buying pressure than selling. However, there are significant liquidation levels at $60,000 and $64,000, which could trigger volatility if the market tests these price points. Overall, InspoCrypto contends that sentiment in the market is moderately bullish, rated at 7 out of 10. While retail traders appear confident and are predominantly taking long positions, the accumulation of shorts by whales signals a potential cautionary stance. At the time of writing, the industry’s largest digital asset is trading at $63,300 for the first time since late August. This represents a 5% increase over the past 24 hours, coupled with gains of 8% and 12% over the past seven and fourteen days, respectively.

The company's first project will be a protocol that offers all investors enhanced yield opportunities.  The protocol will be built on the Solana ecosystem and is expected to go live in early 2025.  Deus X Capital, the $1 billion investment and operating company led by Tim Grant, today launched Solstice Labs, a decentralized finance (DeFi) business, the company said in a press release on Friday.  Solstice Labs is building institutional-grade DeFi products and protocols that will be available to all investors, the company said.  The business' first project is a protocol that offers enhanced yield opportunities, and is expected to go live in early 2025, Deus X said.  It aims to deliver stable and consistent yields for investors, Ben Nadareski, co-founder and CEO of Solstice Labs, told CoinDesk in an interview, and in a democratized fashion, as all users will have the same access to this yield generating opportunity on the Solstice protocol.  The protocol will be developed on the Solana blockchain, and is expected to launch with more than $100 million of total value locked (TVL), with significant investment from Deus X Capital.  Nadareski, who is currently an investment director at Deus X Capital, is co-founder and CEO of Solstice Labs. Tim Grant, CEO of Deus X Capital will be co-founder and chairman of the company. Stuart Connolly, chief investment officer at Deus X and CEO of Alpha Lab 40, is to join the firm as chief investment officer and co-founder.  ""Many DeFi products and protocols have been built using exceptional technology stacks like we have seen with Solana but have largely been overlooked for institutional applications,"" said Nadareski, in the release.  ""This presents a huge opportunity to introduce institutional-grade yield-opportunities and infrastructure into DeFi which will allow for a far broader range of investment participation,"" he added.  Solstice Labs will work closely with Cor Prime, a prime broker, and Alpha Lab 40, a proprietary trading firm, both of which are portfolio companies of Deus X Capital.
