However, this dominance is on the decline as more altcoins are being chosen as the preferred digital currencies for payments. This has mainly been due to cheaper fees resulting from network congestion when the price gets too high. Instead, cryptocurrencies whose fees can range from a few cents to fractions of a cent are now favored by merchants. Altcoins Are Taking Market Share From Bitcoin Crypto payments processor BitPay recently released a report outlining the percentages each crypto commanded in the crypto payments space. As expected, Bitcoin dominated the list but what was important to note from the report was how much the pioneer cryptocurrency&apos;s dominance over this space dropped in the space of a year. Between 2020 and 2021, bitcoin lost about 27% dominance.

42411544,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOo44,1642456200,"Pussy Riot, Political Action and the Future of DAOs","Growing up, Nadya Tolokonnikova, one of the founders of protest collective Pussy Riot, wanted to be a feminist. That’s what the 32-year-old artist and punk rocker told CoinDesk at Consensus 2022 in Austin, Texas.  Pussy Riot, Tolokonnikova explained while sitting on the floor of the Austin Convention Center, is often mistakenly thought of as just a punk-rock outfit – one that first made headlines in 2012 for their anti-Putin anthems. But the group, which operates like an off-chain decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), is so much more.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “Anyone can join Pussy Riot,” Tolokonnikova said on the Big Ideas stage on Saturday. “We're open source, we write our own code … We’re decentralized, we’re autonomous, and we’re an organization.”  The artistic, political collective – which counts over 100 members, of which a punk band is just a small part – is working toward a more equal world. Over the past decade, Pussy Riot has founded media companies, published books and staged protests on and offline to further their “global feminist protest art movement.”  See also: Crypto: The Gift That Keeps On Giving (to Charity) | Opinion  Lately, the group has been using the censorship-resistant tools enabled by crypto. Tolokonnikova was a co-founder of women and LGBTQ+ activist group Unicorn DAO. She also helped found Ukraine DAO, which auctioned an image of the Ukrainian flag in March for 2,258 ETH (approximately $6.75 million at the time) to support people affected by the Russian invasion.  “My goal is for future generations that are going to be onboarding into Web 3 … will have gender equality,” Tolokonnikova said. “This is how I see my role in crypto.”  Last week, as the Consensus event was unfolding a few blocks to the south, members of Pussy Riot, UnicornDAO and the Lakota Indigenous group Ikiya Collective charged into the Texas State Capitol building to stage a protest.  They unfurled a 45-foot banner reading “MATRIARCHY NOW!” from the third floor and then rushed out of the building. The moment of “domination” was minted as a non-fungible token (NFT) using auction platform Party Bid. To date, the group has raised 2.38980764 ETH – worth just shy of $3,000 – from 23 contributors to fund reproductive rights.  John Caldwell, a founder of Unicorn, said the group was “surprised” by how little attention and support this protest action has received. Texas, a U.S. state known for supporting the ideals of autonomy, personal freedom and limited state intervention, has been at the forefront of the conservative-led charge to roll back abortion rights, he said.  “I didn’t come here for the conference, I came here to protest,” Tolokonnikova said, adding that the crowdfunding model allows anyone who’s so inclined to contribute dollars or cents to their cause. Decrypt reported “mixed reactions,” with some Capitol building visitors snapping pictures and others hurrying out of the way.  Though she’s similarly taken aback by how little buzz the Capitol publicity stunt generated, Tolokonnikova said crypto is full of energy. “A lot of people here are visionaries. They want to build a better world,” she said.  Perhaps no one knows better than Tolokonnikova how much work goes on behind the scenes at activist causes. She said she splits her time doing logistical work for the DAO – answering emails, participating in her Discord channels, speaking to artists and auction houses – and planning showstopping events.  As co-founder of independent media outlet Mediazona, she has spoken before the U.S. Congress, British Parliament, European Parliament and performed at Banksy's Dismaland exhibition.  See also: DAOs and the Coming InDAOstrial Revolution | Opinion  At an earlier Consensus event on the Big Ideas stage, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) professor and head of the Australian university’s Blockchain Innovation Hub, Ellie Rennie, said that DAOs are a new type of organization that will require a new mix of interpersonal and technological skills to get right.  She noted that we should also not vilify DAOs that experiment and fail. “To be transient is OK,” she said. “We need to find what makes communities resilient.”  Perhaps the hardest task for DAO managers, faced with a tool that adds elements of financialization and speculation to social causes, is creating ways to “align” everyone’s needs. Economic incentives may encourage participation, but perhaps not commitment.  Others come to crypto precisely because it is apolitical – a space that seems insulated from the dramas, inconsistencies and superficialities of modern-day politics. Crypto, by creating tools that anyone can use, has a plausible case for being “credibly neutral.”  Of course, some would disagree. Perhaps crypto will only rebound from the unfolding bear market if it finds a way to meaningfully engage with the world. In politics, perhaps that means crypto becoming an effective tool for change.  “Being apolitical there is no such thing,” Tolokonnikova said. “Apolitical just means supporting players that are already in power.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/01/17/pussy-riot-political-action-and-the-future-of-daos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3b5f6f128f67abd2ac9596738282efb5eea40667-544x408.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396196,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT1WsZ,1642451414,"Ethereum Gas Site Fees.wtf’s WTF Token Down 80%, Following SOS and GAS","The cult website Fees.wtf, which shows Ethereum users their lifetime gas spend on transactions, saw its WTF token plummet 80% in its initial week post-airdrop.  According to CoinMarketCap, the WTF token price has plummeted more than 80% from its high of $0.20 on Thursday evening to $0.03 as of Monday morning.  Fees.wtf launched in early 2019 as a lighthearted way to show users their total transaction costs paid per Ethereum wallet.  “I was looking to show people how much gas they’ve spent in an easy to comprehend format,” the anonymous founder of Fees.wtf told CoinDesk via Twitter. “As time went on and ETH increased in value, the website's popularity grew as suddenly people realized those cheaper transactions in the past have added up to a lot of [U.S. dollars].”  Airdrop mania  Fees.wtf appears to have taken a page from the playbook of GasDAO, another project that launched last month that rewarded users with airdropped tokens based on a wallet’s gas usage.  Ethereum transaction costs, colloquially referred to as “gas fees,” have long been a pain point in the Ethereum community, with many bemoaning that high transaction costs have made Ethereum unusable for the average retail user. A single transaction (such as purchasing a non-fungible token or swapping tokens on decentralized exchange Uniswap) could range from $15-$20 on the lower end to thousands of dollars during periods of peak demand.  On Dec. 29, Ethereum users who spent more than a $1,559 threshold in gas fees (a tongue-in-cheek reference to EIP-1559) were eligible to claim GAS tokens.  GasDAO, in turn, followed in the footsteps of OpenDAO, a project that launched on Christmas Eve, airdropping users of non-fungible token marketplace OpenSea with free SOS tokens.  According to CoinMarketCap, OpenDAO’s SOS token is down 74% since its all-time high post-airdrop, while GasDAO’s GAS token has plummeted 93%.  All three projects lured users into claiming free tokens and advertised high yields for staking the tokens, even as the values of the tokens have gone into free fall just days after the initial launch.  Gas guzzler  As Ethereum users raced to claim WTF tokens during last Thursday’s airdrop, the congestion sent Fees.wtf to the top of Etherscan’s “Top Gas Guzzlers” dashboard, even rendering Ethereum near unstable for over an hour.  “At one point it was close to 40% of total gas usage,” a member of the Fees.wtf team told CoinDesk via Twitter. “I think a lesson to be learned here – for those that haven't already learnt it from other launches – is to check gas prices before you just blindly click submit, as I'm sure a few people paid a hefty sum to get their airdrop.”  Posting one’s Fees.wtf gas usage has also become a flex for Ethereum users to both bemoan the high gas costs and signal one’s ""whale"" status. Some longtime users of the Ethereum blockchain have taken to Twitter to post screenshots of their gas usage, with some exceeding millions of dollars.  The Fees.wtf team is composed of four anonymous members – a manager, community lead, developer and designer – who have all “been in the cryptocurrency space for many years” and “seen the evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem,” a member of the team told CoinDesk.  New features  For now, the Fees.wtf team is focused on developing the Pro Dashboard, a feature granted only to holders of the Fees.wtf NFT. That was airdropped to all claimants who were required to pay 0.01 ETH (approximately $33).  “We’re hard at work developing features that our users have been asking for over the years,” said a member of the Fees.wtf team. “The dashboard will focus not only on how much gas you’ve spent, but we’ll also look at ‘what ifs’, assist with gas usage for tax implications, and also try to help users find the cheapest times to make transactions.”  However, it appears that the new Pro Dashboard has no relationship with the WTF token, the latter of which appears to hold little utility. The team hasn't yet indicated whether the token would provide governance use-cases for the project or be incorporated into the new dashboard product.  “I've always been a fan of the site, and so I hope the token does end up having a real use case,” Twitter user and community code reviewer @0xQuit told CoinDesk.

Just 12% Of Bitcoin Supply Is Now Held By Exchanges As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the percentage of BTC supply stored on exchanges has now dropped down to just 12%. The all exchanges reserve is an on-chain indictor that measures the total amount of Bitcoin currently held by wallets of all exchanges. The &apos;percentage of BTC supply on exchanges&apos; is a metric that tells us the ratio between the exchange reserve and the total supply of the crypto. When the value of this indicator moves up, it means exchange wallets are receiving a net amount of coins. As investors usually send their coins to exchanges for selling purposes, this supply is often referred to as the sell supply of the market. Therefore, an uptrend in it can be bearish for the price of the crypto. On the other hand, when the metric&apos;s value moves down, it means holders are withdrawing their Bitcoin from exchanges. Prolonged such trend can imply there is accumulation going on in the market, and the available supply is shrinking. Hence, downwards movement of the indicator can be bullish for BTC.

42411536,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOngv,1642444665,What You Own When You Own an NFT,"I do not know who needs to hear this, but owning an NFT is not the same as owning a project’s copyright or intellectual property. This is the first point I’d like to make.  An NFT, or non-fungible token, is a type of digital asset that lives on a blockchain. It has a monetary value and is useful to authenticate and track the provenance of another piece of digital media. That can be JPEGs but also music files, or really anything else that can be saved to a hard drive. But an NFT is not the underlying media itself. That’s the second point.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Spending any amount of money, be it $5 or $40 million, on anything auctioned or traded as an NFT does not give you legal ownership over the underlying media associated with that token. What you do own when you buy an NFT are the keys to a non-fungible – perhaps unique – token. That token is yours to trade or hold or display in Decentraland. But the digital file associated with an NFT is just as easy to copy and paste and download as any other – the third point.  Consider this a PSA. The relationship between NFTs and digital works is nuanced. There’s often confusion anywhere that crypto rubs up against the real world. And while NFTs fit neatly into existing copyright law, there’s a possibility that these new technologies could alter existing IP protection standards for the better.  None of this is exactly obvious from looking at platforms like OpenSea or when you wade into NFT Twitter. Which is why I wanted to state it. Non-fungible tokens are often promoted as a way to bring “scarcity” and “permanence” to infinitely reproducible digital objects. In a way this view is correct. NFTs do bring scarcity to digital goods, but that scarcity is limited to the blockchain-based token itself.  It also seems reasonable to think if you buy a Bored Ape NFT, that ape is yours. As mentioned, the underlying intellectual property belongs to the creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (who have Hollywood representation for their work), but the buyer might have a close emotional bond with “their” character. This might explain why people are using Bored Apes characters as profile pics on Twitter and LinkedIn.  Things get spicy  This weekend NFT critics drew an analogy and their ire to a recent successful auction of a rare print of the classic sci-fi novel ""Dune."" In December, SpiceDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization, paid $3 million to buy Alejandro Jodorowsky’s unpublished manuscript for an unmade film adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 400-page odyssey at a Christie’s auction.  This weekend, a month after the hammer fell, the DAO tweeted its plans for the storyboard. They wanted to “make the book public (to the extent permitted by law),” “produce an original animated limited series inspired by the book and sell it to a streaming service” and “support derivative projects from the community.”  See also: Rare ‘Dune’ Manuscript Bought on DAO’s Behalf for $3M, but It Only Raised $700K  Seeing this tweet – of a plan that was known essentially when SpiceDAO initially crowdfunded $11.8 million – Wikipedia contributor and Web 3 critic Molly White published a story on her blog “Web 3 Is Going Great” titled, “SpiceDAO wins a $3 million auction to buy an extremely rare storyboard book of 'Dune,' only to learn that owning a book doesn't confer them copyright.” Other media orgs jumped at the occasion.  “[SpiceDAO] were quickly informed that buying the physical book did not somehow confer to them copyright or licensing rights (much like how buying an NFT does not automatically confer you the rights to the underlying artwork!). You'd think they might have checked that first,” White wrote.  Others joined a Twitter pile on. Some noted how buying a rare book isn’t the same as owning its contents. Others erroneously suggested the DAO purchased an NFT of the manuscript, which, of course, also wouldn’t confer ownership of ""Dune’s"" intellectual property. There is no NFT or plans for one, as far as I can tell.  Also called “Jodorowsky’s Bible,” the work is a collection of writings and prints that have historical significance. Making it as public as possible seems the right thing to do. Many noted the book’s contents are already hosted online (on Google Photos, for instance), but the DAO wanted to make public ownership a little more durable as Google can remove the file whenever.  See also: Google Bans Crypto Mining Apps from Play Store  The DAO members also wanted to treat the work with the appropriate amount of respect. A crowdfund was just one way to show how meaningful it is to the public. Creating derivative works by highly-motivated fans is another.  SpiceDAO is seemingly aware of what it bought and the legal considerations of its plans. After winning the auction, the DAO’s co-founder Soban Saqib told Buzzfeed it was in the process of transferring ownership for permanent storage, and figuring out how to manage the multiple copyrights for the ""bible’s"" contents that artists and their estates can lay claim to.  Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" will not become public domain until 2060 in the U.S. and 2054 in the European Union, but there are still things the DAO can do. The laws around fan fiction are a little looser, and the “fair use” exemption gives some leeway.  Although the DAO has a governance token (SPICE) that trades on the open market, it’s not clear the group aims to profit from its endeavors. It might bump up against securities rules. And after being forced to rename itself from DuneDAO due to copyright complaints, you can be sure it's aware of certain limitations.  Representatives for SpiceDAO did not return a request for comment.  What does this mean for NFTs?  NFTs and DAOs are hemmed in by the law as it stands, and are relatively technologically simple things. NFTs are tokens for provenance. That makes it easier to assign value to digital items. DAOs are a way of organizing people, sharing funds and executing plans. There’s a lot of promise, but many limitations. The law isn’t necessarily one.  NFTs and DAOs are part of a sea change in how people think about the web and digital ownership. It’s a “public goods” mindset, an overriding belief that people should be able to profit from their labors and collaborate more efficiently.  See also: NFT Artist Brian Frye Wants You to Steal This Article  There’s a legal standing that already fits this attitude: open copyright. There’s a growing trend for NFT creators to release their projects as CCO – the least restrictive copyright – so anyone can download, remix, transform and profit from these digital items. The tokens will still have an owner, but the work belongs to all.  In the U.S. there is a policy that any medium – a song, a picture, a three-hour blockbuster film – is your property by default so long as you created the work. On Twitter, you make a post and you technically own the intellectual property behind it. You and you alone own that tweet. Same for blogposts. Or uploading pictures. By default, you own that work.  Frank Herbert’s estate may want to keep profiting from Herbert’s ""Dune,"" which is within its right. It’s entirely possible the next great work of literary significance will be crowdfunded by a DAO or an NFT. Let’s hope it truly does belong to the world.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MANA | MARKET | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/01/17/what-you-own-when-you-own-an-nft,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f3706a6cd61c4fbf1db7669b26c0a59a19b1bafe-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Related Reading | Why This Token Thrives With A 38% Profit While Bitcoin And Ethereum Bleed According to Wu Blockchain, a OlympusDAO Whale triggered a cascade of liquidations on the protocol during today&apos;s trading session. This led to a 44% crash in OHM&apos;s price within an hour. At this time, the APY offered to OHM holders stood at around 190,000%. As reported by NewsBTC, OlympusDAO is an algorithmic currency protocol that was classified in 2021 as high risk, but with the potential to display a &apos;countercyclical&apos; price behavior by research firm Delphi Digital. In other words, OHM&apos;s price could move against the general sentiment in the market. However, OHM seems to have been unable to meet its potential or at least seems to have failed at appreciating as the crypto market trends to the downside. OHM&apos;s price action has been driven by early investors taking profits on their gains. User Freddie Raynolds identified the Ethereum transaction used by a &apos;savage&apos; OlympusDAO user to dump $11 million in OHM. The transaction caused a 25% slippage and $5 million in liquidations for this asset, as Raynolds reported via his Twitter ac...",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ohm-holders-wake-up-to-blood-how-this-olympusdao-whale-sank-its-price-by-44/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Designed to be vastly superior to Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of speed and scalability, TON got off to a good start, raising almost $1.7 billion from investors through an initial coin offering.

That move ultimately led Telegram to drop the TON project, handing over the work it had done to the open-source community, which has since rebranded GRAM as Toncoin.

42375493,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8X1z,1642437851,Indian Prime Minister Calls for Global Cooperation on Cryptocurrency,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for global cooperation to tackle the challenges posed by cryptocurrencies.  Speaking virtually at the 2022 World Economic Forum's annual Davos conference, Modi said, ""Cryptocurrency is an example of the kind of challenges we are facing as a global family with a changing global order. To fight this, every nation, every global agency needs to have collective and synchronized action.""  Likening cryptocurrency to supply-chain disruptions, inflation and climate change, Modi said that ""the kind of technology cryptocurrency is associated with makes decisions taken by one country inadequate to meet the challenges posed by cryptocurrency. We have to have common thinking.""  The Indian government has yet to formulate its own regulatory framework for crypto assets, and has already decided to study regulatory measures elsewhere and how global standards on cryptocurrencies evolve. The Finance Ministry has reached out to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) to frame its legislation.  The country's draft cryptocurrency bill probably won’t become law until after the year’s budget session ends in April. The bill has reportedly evolved from prohibiting all private cryptocurrencies while allowing “for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology"" to enabling cryptocurrency to be used as an asset but banning its use as currency or payment.  In his address, Modi asked whether multilateral organizations are equipped to tackle modern challenges.  ""When these institutions were formed circumstances were different and today they are different,"" he said. ""That's why every democratic nation has the responsibility to bring about an emphasis towards reforms in these institutions to make them capable enough to deal with modern challenges in the future.""  Modi, who leads the world's second-most populous country, ended his address by saying new challenges need new directions, that every nation needs the support of other nations much more than before, and that he has faith the discussions at the conference will bear fruit.  On Nov. 18, 2021, Modi gave a virtual keynote address at the Sydney Dialogue, an annual summit on emerging technology, and said democratic countries should work together to ensure crypto “doesn’t end up in the wrong hands” and “spoil our youths.”",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/01/17/indian-prime-minister-calls-for-global-cooperation-on-cryptocurrency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/55a99b12ee0c3a41a2beafdc6ec799f9634e16e5-1024x682.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The mining machine will have a hashrate of 198 TH/s, power efficiency (@ 35°C) of 27.5 joules per terahash (J/TH) and will consume 5445 watts of power, according to a tweet.

42411551,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOoHI,1642433085,"In the Metaverse, Gameplay Is What Matters","Blockchain-based metaverse experiences are a hot topic right now because they combine two of the technology industry’s biggest transformation drivers that have been around for a long time, attracting millions of users and participants – immersive digital experiences and stakeholder-based commerce.  Where the newer blockchain-based ecosystems have made a difference is in offering users an ongoing stake in the ecosystem. Yet, that’s very reminiscent of Second Life, another very successful immersive world that came to widespread attention a decade ago and compares to some of the blockbuster experiences that exist today.  Paul Brody is EY’s global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.  At the top level, there are two critical takeaways for companies looking to enter the metaverse.  The first is that community is powerful and remarkably durable. Though Second Life may not make a lot of headlines anymore, it has a remarkably consistent and loyal user base, even if it’s not enormous. It also has a robust economy that is driven by ongoing sales of real estate in that virtual world.  The second takeaway is that while community is enduring, it is gameplay that drives usage into the tens of millions. The biggest immersive digital experiences all have the same thing in common: They’re all games. From Minecraft to Roblox to Fortnite and quite a few others, the difference between having monthly average users in the tens of thousands and tens of millions is the difference between a 3D world that’s built for socializing and one that’s driven by gameplay, with social connections integrated.  The next big thing: stakeholder-driven gaming?  What hasn’t been tested – yet – is if a high-performance gameplay-driven experience can be built in one of the new emerging decentralized ecosystems taking shape now. There are technical challenges around how blockchains operate that don’t make this simple, but if it were done successfully, it would shake up the gaming and metaverse ecosystems substantially. The most successful games have tended to build strong dedicated communities from casual players to organized teams and hugely successful streaming personalities. Until now, those communities haven’t really had any stake in the game itself.  Stakeholder-driven gaming could have a big impact on the culture of gaming itself, which is not always known for being warm and friendly. Personalities in the gaming industry find themselves on a relentless treadmill with no safety net. On top of an already rough and tumble culture, women, minorities and members of the LGBTQ community often face relentless bullying in the comment feeds and online forums. (For a good primer on how rewarding though rough this ecosystem is, check out this excellent Washington Post article.)  A stakeholder-driven model that rewards big contributors with an ongoing share in the ecosystem as a whole – not just their own performance – might help balance the ups and downs of the business for individuals. And for community holders who have an economic stake in the ecosystem as a whole, the threat of economic confiscation for ugly behavior might have a powerful moderating effect as well. That would keep the fun in gaming, which is the point.

Originally founded with a focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) in August 2020, the firm pivoted to blockchain-based gaming after a slew of home run investments in the sector, including metaverse platform Star Atlas, play-to-earn Ember Sword and guild giant Yield Guild Games, according to a press release Monday.  “Right now it's called play-to-earn, but I think there’s a big push among industry participants to try to rebrand to play-and-earn,” Marc Weinstein, head of platforms at Mechanism Capital, told CoinDesk in an interview. “We want to back games that people want to play regardless of the crypto incentives.”  The firm is eyeing mobile gaming as the industry’s next big area of growth, hiring Steve Cho as its latest partner. Cho joins Mechanism Capital from Apple, where he led business efforts “to better understand NFTs and blockchain gaming” for the App Store.  The firm says it's also working to form direct partnerships with studios to develop games in addition to providing capital.  The play-to-earn arena has been no stranger to the launch of mammoth gaming funds in recent months.

42375492,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8WzT,1642423908,Technical Indicator Points to Bitcoin Price Bounce,"A lesser-tracked technical analysis indicator is signaling good times ahead for bitcoin.  The cryptocurrency's 10-week simple moving average (SMA) is about to dip below the 50-week SMA, confirming a so-called bearish crossover.  Historically, the negative signal has proven to be a contrary indicator, marking interim price bottoms and the end of bear markets, as the chart above shows.  The previous bearish cross dated mid-March 2020 occurred after bitcoin's coronavirus-induced crash to $4,000. Bitcoin picked up in the subsequent months, setting record highs above $20,000 by December.  Similarly, bitcoin bottomed out and rebounded at least 25% following the confirmation of the negative crossovers in early January 2020 and mid-June 2018.  Moving averages are based on backward-looking data. Thus, on weekly and monthly charts, bearish and bullish crossovers can be taken to represent oversold or overbought conditions and the potential for price bounce and bull market corrections.  That said, technical studies are unreliable as standalone indicators and seasoned traders prefer to read chart-based signals with money flow and fundamentals, which are currently signaling a low probability of a significant price bounce.  Bitcoin suffered a deeper drop following the confirmation of the first bear cross between 10- and 50-week MAs seen in September 2014.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/17/technical-indicator-points-to-bitcoin-price-bounce,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/171c0ef75c29c22881e22686691b08160e39e085-2476x1374.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The country's markets regulator, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV), now has the power to regulate crypto ads.  Starting in a month's time, influencers and their sponsors will be required to notify authorities in advance of posts promoting crypto. They will also have to warn of its risks, the FT reported Monday. Failure to do so will result in fines.  Rodrigo Buenaventura, the head of CNMV, described influencers as ""a backdoor to avoid regulation"" because they are not subject to the same rules as traditional media.  One of the triggers for the new requirements was World Cup-winning soccer star Andrés Iniesta's promotion of crypto exchange Binance in November.  Iniesta tweeted that he was “learning how to get started with crypto with @binance #BinanceForAll,” to his 25 million followers. The CNMV replied to the tweet, saying that ""cryptoassets, being unregulated products, carry some significant risks.”  Authorities in other jurisdictions have taken similar moves to curb crypto firms' abilities to advertise.  The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) today ordered that digital assets companies should not market their services to the public whether in newspapers, magazines, broadcast media or social media.

Businesses of all sizes are increasingly looking to monetize user data in order to power their products and services. However, the way in which these businesses go about extracting value from data often lacks fairness and transparency. Take Facebook, for example. The social media giant has come under fire in recent years for its business model, which is based on monetizing user data without giving anything back to the users themselves. This was most recently highlighted with the company&apos;s rebranding to &apos;Meta&apos;, which signifies its concerning foray into the metaverse industry. Google is another high-profile example of a company that has faced criticism for its monetization of user data. The search giant has been embroiled in a number of antitrust cases in Europe, with regulators accusing the company of abusing its dominant market position to prioritize its own products and services over those of its competitors. Thankfully, blockchain technology offers a potential solution to this issue. Blockchain is a distributed database that allows for the creation of digital ownership and fair distribution of wealth through trustless and permissionless protocols. This makes it an ideal technology for enabling a more equitable data monetization model.

42375502,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8XC3,1642417129,Cardano Price Surges on SundaeSwap DEX Catalyst,"Cardano's (ADA) price jumped 13% in 24 hours before Thursday's planned launch of SundaeSwap, the first decentralized finance (DeFi) exchange on the Cardano blockchain.  “SundaeSwap will launch as a fully functional beta decentralized exchange (DEX),” the project's developers confirmed in a blog post on Sunday. Projects will be allowed to create trading pools for their tokens after Tuesday, the team added.  Cardano surged to $1.55 in European morning hours on Monday, up from Sunday’s low of $1.28. Charts show $1.55 is a historic resistance level, suggesting some profit taking could occur and potentially push prices downward.  SundaeSwap (SUNDAE), like other decentralized exchanges, uses smart contracts to match token trades between users and distributes a portion of trading fees back to the investors who provide liquidity to the platform, a process broadly known as ""yield farming.""  Exchange users can earn SUNDAE rewards in the first six months following SundaeSwap’s launch. However, the launch remains a beta rollout with limited features and expected trade matching times of “hours to days” initially.  “While the DEX’s smart contracts have been fully audited and the DEX will meet all industry standards for security, the implementation of fully decentralized governance will not be immediately possible due to existing transaction size limits on the Cardano blockchain,” the team explained in the post.  Top DEXs built on other blockchains are some of the most valuable products in the crypto market.

42375489,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw8Wvh,1642414510,Case for Bitcoin Bottom Near $40K Is Weak as Institutions Stay Away,"While the bitcoin options market has recently shed its bearish bias, some analysts remain unconvinced about the strength of the move owing to weak institutional demand and the cryptocurrency's sensitivity to macro factors.  Laurent Kssis, a crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) expert and director of CEC Capital, said there are few signs of renewed interest from institutional investors, so a big price bounce soon looks unlikely. ""A good barometer is always the asset under management and inflows into crypto exchange-traded products and ETFs. So far we have recovered only $1 billion of inflows versus $4 billion that has left these products alone in January,"" Kssis told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  The image above, from ByteTree Asset Management, shows the number of coins held by U.S. and Canadian closed-ended funds and Canadian and European ETFs has declined by 8,812 BTC ($377 million) since mid-December.  Inflows into the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF listed on the New York Stock Exchange (BITO) have slowed. ""BITO now holds less than 5,000 CME futures contracts for the first time since November, and its AUM has reached its lowest level since Oct. 19, signaling dwindling interest for BTC exposure through futures-based ETFs,"" Arcane Research said in last week's research note, referring to assets under management.  The Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which invests in bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) in a bid to mimic the cryptocurrency's price performance, is vulnerable to contango bleed.  Institutions and large traders usually set market trends while retailers swim the tide. Institutions' refusal to step in should cause concern to the bulls expecting a rally from the recently held psychological support level of $40,000.  Adverse macro  Crypto services provider Amber Group said a continued rise in real or inflation-adjusted interest rates poses the biggest downside risk to bitcoin and risk assets, in general. ""Bitcoin's correlation with the stock market has gone up,"" Amber Group said.  Since mid-November, the U.S. 10-year real yield has jumped 50 basis points to -0.66%, data provided by the U.S. Department of the Treasury shows. Bitcoin has declined almost 40% during the same period.  The correlation between bitcoin and M1 money supply has increased to 0.77, pointing to a strong statistical relationship between the two, blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock said in a research note published over the weekend. That implies a bearish outlook for bitcoin if the Federal Reserve begins raising borrowing costs every quarter, as anticipated by the interest-rate market.  Non-directional trading preferred  Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from Blofin, a crypto-asset management company, said traders might be better off betting on a volatility explosion by holding long positions in options than predicting and betting on where the price might be headed next.  ""Long vega and long gamma [buying call or put options or both] are good solutions with some costs, for implied volatility is too low for the sell side, which means an improper risk-reward ratio,"" Ardern said in a Telegram chat. Being long vega means holding options positions that will benefit from a rise in volatility.  Implied volatility is investors' expectations for price turbulence over a specific period and positively impacts the option's price. Furthermore, it's a metric that tends to revert to its mean value.  Seasoned traders typically buy both call and put options at the same time when the implied volatility is cheap and sell options when the metric is too high. Over the past four weeks, the one-month implied volatility has crashed from an annualized 84% to 59%, according to data source Skew. As of writing, the metric hovered well below its lifetime average of 76%, looking cheap by historical standards.  At press time, bitcoin was changing hands near $42,700, little changed on the day. The cryptocurrency jumped nearly 3% in the seven days through Jan. 16, defending the $40,000 support level and snapping a two-week losing trend, CoinDesk data show.  Key support at $40,000  CEC Capital's Kssis foresees a retest of $40,000 should the cryptocurrency fail to establish a foothold above $43,000 this week and favors protective strategies to insure against a possible deeper decline. Traders typically buy put options or sell futures as a hedge against a long position in the spot market.  Put-call skews, which measure the spread between prices of puts, or bearish bets, and calls, bullish bets, were trading little changed at press time, implying a neutral bias. One-month futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) barely drew a premium to the spot price while those on other exchanges were trading at a premium of less than 5% annualized, a far cry from the double-digit figures observed in October and November. That's perhaps the result of traders selling futures to hedge their exposure.  According to Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, bitcoin remains vulnerable to a more profound drop due to the lack of buying demand. ""We are not seeing any bottom fishing at these levels, and the interest to own bitcoin risk around $40,000 remains low,"" Balani told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat. ""We could retest $40,000 and should that break; we can see a fresh round of selling come through.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/17/case-for-bitcoin-bottom-near-40k-is-weak-as-institutions-stay-away,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/799133625350a3a8553ecd112776f9b03656a205-1400x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Polygon and Hyperedge Capital also participated in the round, according to a report by TechCrunch on Monday. The funds will be used to spearhead a push into Web 3 gaming.  Having developed a range of games that have attracted tens of millions of downloads, nCore's bigger focus is turning to the metaverse and launching its own non-fungible tokens (NFT).

The report contrasted China’s crackdown on bitcoin throughout 2021 to El Salvador taking the “opposite approach” by adopting the digital asset as legal tender.  “We think the two developments observed this year couldn’t be more opposed. Time will certainly tell which path is more successful,” Fidelity wrote.  Even though many countries around the world are taking a strict approach to regulating crypto, Fidelity doesn’t believe that outright bans are on the table.  “An outright ban will be difficult to achieve at best and, if successful, will lead to a significant loss of wealth and opportunity,” reads the report.  Instead, as more countries adopt bitcoin, other countries will be forced to as well even if they don’t believe in the investment thesis or adoption of bitcoin.  “We also think there is very high stakes game theory at play here, whereby if bitcoin adoption increases, the countries that secure some bitcoin today will be better off competitively than their peers,” said the report. “In other words, a small cost can be paid today as a hedge compared to a potentially much larger cost year in the future.”  At an institutional level, a Fidelity Digital Assets Institutional Investor Survey found that 71% of U.S. and European institutional investors surveyed intend to allocate to digital assets in the future.

Digital payment token (DPT) service providers ""should not promote their DPT services to the general public in Singapore,"" MAS said in a statement.

Digital asset firms should not market their services in public areas or media that address the general public including newspapers, broadcast and magazines or social media platforms. That includes collaborations with influencers, MAS said.  Crypto ATMs are considered a form of promotion and so should also not be made available in public areas. Crypto firms are allowed to advertise on their own sites and social media accounts.  The guidelines apply to all firms offering crypto services in Singapore, including those licensed under Singapore's Payment Services Act, which gives crypto firms a path to regulated operations in the city state.

Some 100,000 ""land parcels"" were issued on Pavia, each being minted as a unique non-fungible token (NFT) with individual ""coordinates."" Over 60% of these parcels were pre-sold in October and November 2021, with the remaining set to go on sale in the first quarter of 2022.  NFTs are blockchain-based representations of tangible or intangible objects. Metaverses generally describe a virtual world in which people can interact as they do in the real world, but digitally.  Pavia’s native token functions as an in-game currency, 25% of which was airdropped to NFT landholders following a blockchain snapshot in December 2021. Data from MuesliSwap, a Cardano-based exchange, show pavia tokens sell for just over 20 cents at the time of writing and have a market capitalization of over $107 million.  Data shows there are now over 8,300 plot owners on Pavia. However, users cannot deploy assets over their plots as of Monday. “Please remember at this stage in development you cannot visit or deploy any content onto your land parcel,” documents from Pavia caution.  The project comes at a time when virtual land plots are being sold for millions of dollars on virtual ecosystems, built on blockchains like Ethereum. The plots on pavia were listed for as high as 30,000 cardano (≈$45,600 at the time of writing) on the Cardano NFT marketplace CNFT.  Companies have recently rushed to create their presence on the metaverse.
