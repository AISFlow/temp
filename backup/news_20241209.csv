A US-based think tank told Amazon to assess the prospect of using a portion of its financial reserve to hold Bitcoin to increase its shareholder‚Äôs value and fight off inflation. According to a recommendation made by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), the shareholders of the company are asking its Board to investigate if including cryptocurrencies into the treasury of the online retail store serves the best long-term interests of shareholders.

The American think tank suggested that Amazon should assess the benefits of holding some Bitcoin, encouraging the company to allot even 5% of its $585 billion assets to the cryptocurrency. ‚ÄúThough Bitcoin is currently a volatile asset ‚Äì as Amazon stock has been at times throughout its history ‚Äì corporations have a responsibility to maximize shareholder value over the long-term as well as the short-term,‚Äù NCPRR stated in the document.

Fighting Inflation The NCPRR said that the inflation rate in the US is going up, adding that cash and bonds are no longer the best approach to protect Amazon‚Äôs money. The US-based think tank cited that in the last four years, the average inflation rate in the country is pegged at 4.95%, which even went up to 9.1% in June 2022. It added that the true inflation rate is significantly higher, saying that several studies showed that it is nearly double the Consumer Price Index on occasion. ‚ÄúAmazon should ‚Äì and perhaps has a fiduciary duty to ‚Äì consider adding assets to its treasury that appreciate more than bonds, even if those assets are more volatile short term,‚Äù NCPPR remarked.

Or how Cosmos is shaking things up with its new interoperability features that connect blockchains like never before? These breakthroughs are turning heads in the crypto world. Amidst these developments, Qubetics ($TICS) emerges as a fresh contender with a bold vision. Unlike others, Qubetics addresses real-world issues that have held back blockchain adoption. With its presale already attracting attention, $TICS is a strong pick for anyone looking for the best coins with 1000X potential . Qubetics Redefines Blockchain Development with QubeQode IDE Qubetics is set to change the game with its innovative QubeQode IDE , an all-in-one tool for simplifying blockchain application development. Whether you‚Äôre a tech-savvy entrepreneur or someone with no coding experience, this platform empowers users to create decentralised applications with ease. Imagine a small retail business wanting to launch a blockchain-based loyalty programme. Instead of hiring expensive developers, the owner can use QubeQode‚Äôs drag-and-drop features to create a smart contract and manage customer rewards effortlessly. Or picture a logistics company needing better transparency for supply chains. QubeQode provides form-based configurations that allow managers to track goods and authenticate records‚Äîall without dealing with complex code. By offering pre-built blockchain functionalities, like token management and user authentication, and a library of pre-written code snippets, QubeQode eliminates the barriers that often keep businesses from exploring blockchain solutions. Qubetics has already sold over 300 million $TICS tokens to more than 8,000 holders, raising $5.3 million in its 12th presale stage. Currently priced at $0.031, $TICS is set to see a 10% price jump in the 13th stage starting this weekend. Each stage lasts just seven days, wrapping up every Sunday at midnight. Now, let‚Äôs look at the numbers. An investment of $36,000 at the current price would yield approximately 1,161,290 $TICS tokens. If the price reaches $0.25 by the presale‚Äôs end, that investment could grow to $290,322‚Äîequating to a 703.21% ROI. Post-presale projections suggest even higher gains, with the token potentially reaching $15, offering returns of 48,092.91%. To learn more about this project, take a look at this video . Litecoin‚Äôs Upgrades and Expanding Appeal Litecoin has long been known as Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äúsilver,‚Äù but its recent developments are helping it carve out its own unique identity.

The latest upgrade enhances its transaction processing capabilities, making it a reliable alternative for merchants looking for quick settlements. Its focus on scalability and reduced energy consumption also aligns with growing demands for eco-friendly crypto solutions. Litecoin is also gaining traction in cross-border transactions, providing a cost-effective and efficient way to transfer money internationally. With its robust network and practical use cases, Litecoin continues to solidify its position in the market as a high-potential investment. Cosmos Connects Blockchains with Seamless Interoperability Cosmos is taking blockchain communication to the next level with its new interoperability features. By allowing blockchains to share data and assets seamlessly, Cosmos eliminates the silos that have long hindered blockchain innovation. This development is a game-changer for developers and users alike. Decentralised apps can now operate across multiple networks, opening up endless possibilities for creating new solutions. For example, financial apps can leverage data from multiple chains, offering users a more connected and efficient experience. Cosmos‚Äôs focus on scalability and usability ensures its place as a forward-thinking platform. Its commitment to interoperability is set to attract more developers and users, further boosting its adoption in the blockchain space. Which Coin Offers the Best 1000X Potential? Qubetics, Litecoin, and Cosmos each bring unique strengths to the table. While Litecoin focuses on fast transactions and secure payments, Cosmos excels in blockchain interoperability. However, Qubetics stands out with its QubeQode IDE and its ability to simplify blockchain adoption across industries. For those eyeing exponential growth, Qubetics‚Äô $TICS token is hard to ignore. Its presale offers a promising entry point, and its innovative solutions make it a contender for the best coins with 1000X potential.

On Monday, these analysts raised the price target for Coinbase Global, Inc‚Äôs stock COIN to $420 per share. The revised estimate represents a notable increase from the firm‚Äôs $375 target. This increase reflects the growing optimism around Coinbase‚Äôs performance. This is largely driven by strong activity in the crypto market, particularly in December. Crypto Market Activity Drives Coinbase Price Target Increase The analysts attributed the boost to a major surge in retail activity within the crypto market. The exchange‚Äôs trading volumes are on track to reach record levels. This makes it one of the most active months for crypto trading in Coinbase‚Äôs history. The analysts pointed to Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility, particularly as its price approached $100,000, as a key factor driving the surge in market activity. They also highlighted the growing interest in altcoins , contributing to the boost. This combination of factors has led to a significant increase in trading volume across the crypto market. Coinbase‚Äôs Strong Year and Surge in Share Price Coinbase‚Äôs stock has soared more than 80% in 2024, reflecting the broader growth in the crypto market. The company saw a significant sharp uptick in its share price. This surge follows Donald Trump‚Äôs unexpected victory in November‚Äôs presidential election. Trump‚Äôs victory catalyzed a rally across digital assets, pushing Bitcoin past the $100,000 mark. This sparked renewed investor interest in crypto. Many investors view Coinbase‚Äôs stocks as an easy way to access the crypto market. Its strong infrastructure and market dominance make it a popular choice for those wanting to profit from crypto‚Äôs rise without managing digital assets directly. Looking Ahead: Strong Predictions for Q4 and 2025 Needham‚Äôs analysts expressed optimism about Coinbase‚Äôs financial trajectory. The analysts forecasted significant results for Q4 2024 and into 2025. Needham‚Äôs analysts predicted that Coinbase will continue to post strong financial results in the near future. For the fourth quarter of 2024, they predict the company will report $435 billion in trading volume and generate $2.1 billion in revenue. They expect the company‚Äôs stock earnings to reach $2.37 per share. Looking ahead to 2025, they forecast the company will earn $8.9 billion in revenue and report earnings per share of $9.61. Despite these optimistic predictions, Coinbase‚Äôs stock fell 8% on Monday, trading at $316.01 by midday. However, this dip does not overshadow the strong growth the company has experienced this year. Its share price has surged from under $200 to over $300, especially following the election.

Its roadmap focuses on increasing visibility through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. As an ERC-20 token, PEPE benefits from Ethereum‚Äôs Proof-of-Stake security. It is available on platforms like Uniswap, Binance, and KuCoin. PEPE‚Äôs popularity and community support contribute to its prominence in the current market cycle. Dogwifhat Dogwifhat is a new meme coin on the Solana blockchain, inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme. WIF stands out among dog-themed tokens in the crypto space, focusing on creating a sense of community and fun. In the current market cycle, interest in meme coins continues and WIF‚Äôs popularity is growing. The coin leverages Solana‚Äôs fast and low-cost transactions, which may attract users. Its appeal lies in the combination of meme culture and blockchain technology, which some investors find intriguing. BONK BONK is another meme coin on the Solana blockchain, featuring a Shiba Inu mascot. It aims to empower the Solana community by redistributing power from venture capital tokens. After a Coinbase listing, BONK surged over 100%. 50% of Bonk‚Äôs supply was airdropped to Solana‚Äôs NFT and DeFi participants, serving as a ‚Äúcommunity coin.‚Äù In mid-December 2023, BONK was the third-largest meme coin by market cap, with a year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. Despite challenges like a high total supply and the volatile nature of meme coins, BONK‚Äôs integration into the Solana ecosystem and involvement in dApps like BonkSwap make it a notable player. In the current market cycle, BONK shows potential due to its community focus and ecosystem integration. Conclusion Although DOGE, PEPE, WIF, and BONK may have limited immediate potential, DOGEN stands out. Tailored for those pursuing the best in life, it embodies luxury and success. With an expected 700% presale growth and potential for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season, DOGEN follows the successful paths of tokens like BONK and WIF.

JasmyCoin JasmyCoin has seen significant price movements recently. In the past week, its price surged by 51.41%. Over the last month it climbed an impressive 123.77% and over six months, it‚Äôs up by 21.62%. JASMY is currently trading between $0.0297 and $0.0532. Technical indicators suggest potential for more growth. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 42.97, indicating the coin isn‚Äôt overbought yet. A Stochastic level of 34.17 implies momentum may be building. Although the MACD level is slightly negative at -0.0006291, it could be poised for a reversal. If JasmyCoin breaks through the nearest resistance level at $0.0596, it might target the second resistance at $0.0625. This move would represent an increase of about 31%. On the downside, if the price drops, it may find support at $0.0197 or even $0.0121. XRP Over the last month, the XRP price surged by 359.68, and by 415.82% in the last six months. Currently, XRP trades between $1.60 and $2.67. The coin is approaching its nearest resistance level at $3.00. Breaking through this point could lead XRP to the next resistance level at $3.61. On the flipside, the closest support level is at $0.9099, which could help stabilize the price if it starts to fall. Technical indicators provide further insight. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $2.54, slightly above the 100-day average of $2.42, suggesting a potential uptrend in the short term. The RSI is at 56.65, indicating that XRP is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic value is 50.66, reflecting a neutral stance. A MACD level of 0.0159 suggests continued price increases for XRP. You might also like: Experts highlight XRP, Cardano, PEPE, and XYZVerse as top bets Pepe Pepe has been on a remarkable run lately.

37439786,https://crypto.news/?p=14317710,1733785273,From $100k to $250k? Analyzing Bitcoin‚Äôs bull market signals,"Who would have thought we‚Äôd see Bitcoin shoot through the roof this quickly, soaring past $100K, albeit retreating slightly at present? As we move forward into 2025, the main question on our minds is: what lies ahead? Is Bitcoin ( BTC ) a bubble about to burst, or are we on track for $150,000‚Äì$200,000 soon? Are there any rational tools to predict its trajectory, or are we left to just play guessing games? From what I‚Äôve observed, the fog starts to lift when you examine on-chain and technical indicators, while also factoring in the macro perspective. Let‚Äôs layer these three types of analysis in this article to see what picture emerges for Bitcoin‚Äôs next move. Table of Contents Extreme greed, rising active addresses, and record hash rate Weekly Golden Cross signals bull market with $150K-$250K potential RSI signals overbought conditions, hints at pullback or consolidation Fibonacci levels and Bollinger Bands signal key support and potential cooling Visualizing Bitcoin‚Äôs market behavior through key indicators Potential crypto space developments in 2025 Closing thoughts Extreme greed, rising active addresses, and record hash rate The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is currently at 78, indicating Extreme Greed, which often signals potential tops in the short term. However, sustained levels of extreme greed during bull markets often align with parabolic price increases before final peaks. This typically precedes short-term pullbacks due to market exuberance, which appears to be what we‚Äôre witnessing now as Bitcoin‚Äôs price hovers around the $100K level. Crypto Fear & Greed Index | Source: Alternative.me The number of active addresses is increasing and, as of Dec. 8, stands at 855,153, suggesting heightened interest and usage of the Bitcoin network. Number of active BTC addresses | Source: Glassnode As of Dec. 9, 2024, Bitcoin‚Äôs hash rate is approximately 850.70 EH/s, reflecting a significant recovery from recent fluctuations but remaining below its all-time high of 949.98 EH/s, recorded on Nov. 26, 2024. While the current hash rate hasn‚Äôt yet reclaimed the ATH, this sustained strength reflects miner confidence and network security‚Äîlong-term bullish signals. Bitcoin‚Äôs price tends to follow the hash rate; the more confident miners are about price appreciation, the less likely they are to sell. BTC hash rate | Source: CoinWarz Weekly Golden Cross signals bull market with $150K-$250K potential The weekly Golden Cross, where the 50-week moving average crosses above the 200-week MA, is a highly significant signal for long-term investors because it often marks the start of major bull markets and the conclusion of prolonged bearish phases. The previous instance of this signal occurred when Bitcoin recovered from the 2018 bear market and eventually surged to an all-time high of $69,000 in 2021. Mirroring its behavior in previous bull cycles, this signal reappeared in early 2024 and preceded Bitcoin‚Äôs parabolic rise to its recent all-time high of $103,647. Previous bull cycles following weekly Golden Crosses have led to gains of 300%‚Äì600%. If this pattern holds, Bitcoin could potentially reach $150,000 to $250,000 before the next major cycle correction. Meanwhile, the next Golden Cross is unlikely until 2026 or 2027, assuming Bitcoin undergoes a complete cycle of price appreciation, correction, and consolidation. BTC Golden & Death Cross pattern | Source: TradingView RSI signals overbought conditions, hints at pullback or consolidation On the weekly timeframe, the Relative Strength Index is at 74.47, consistent with overbought conditions. However, this does not imply a trend reversal right away but rather reflects the possibility of a short-term pullback or a period of sideways price action. In the past, many bull cycles saw similar RSI readings, followed by temporary pullbacks that were then succeeded by renewed rallies to higher highs. In the 2021 bull cycle, the RSI reached similar levels multiple times before peaking above 90, after which Bitcoin experienced a significant correction. Assuming Bitcoin stays in the most recent consolidation range around $100K and the RSI retraces back to a healthier range of 60‚Äì65, the next leg upward could occur. A healthy correction of 10%‚Äì20% or a sideways period would allow the markets to reset before experiencing sustained growth. For reference, a 10% correction from the all-time high of $103,647 would bring Bitcoin‚Äôs price to approximately $93,282. Relative Strength Index | Source: TradingView Fibonacci levels and Bollinger Bands signal key support and potential cooling Fibonacci retracement levels, used in technical analysis to identify potential support and resistance zones, help indicate where a price might retrace before continuing its trend. Based on the chart below: Key Levels: $71,858 (0.618): Major retracement level, acting as a strong support zone (a 30.67% pullback from the all-time high of $103,647). $103,135 (0.786): Significant resistance zone, near the all-time high. Bitcoin‚Äôs price is currently trading slightly below the upper Bollinger Band, signaling strong bullish momentum. However, this position also indicates potential overextension, as prices often retrace or consolidate when deviating significantly from the midline (20-week simple moving average, currently at $71,858). A pullback to $71,858 or further consolidation near the current price of $99,249 would represent a normal cooling-off period within the Bollinger Band framework and prepare the market for potential further gains. Fibonacci retracement levels & Bollinger Bands | Source: TradingView Visualizing Bitcoin‚Äôs market behavior through key indicators To further visually represent Bitcoin‚Äôs market behavior, let‚Äôs look at this colored chart below. It includes a color-coded bar at the top that reflects RSI conditions. The currently visible purple and green color blocks suggest periods of oversold or bullish divergence, reflecting bullish momentum and aligning with RSI overbought levels. The second bar shows market structure trends (e.g., ranging, bullish, or bearish). From the chart, we see green blocks that suggest the market is in a bullish phase, confirming breakout behavior. Next, the main oscillator displays the Awesome Oscillator with divergences and pivot points, where the green peaks above zero and brown regions below confirm positive momentum and bullish pivots. The secondary oscillator below the AO displays similar momentum indications, with positive bars (green above zero) suggesting accelerating upward momentum and a strong bullish bias. Bitcoin Rainbow Indicators | Source: TradingView Potential crypto space developments in 2025 Post-halving supply shock, increasing retail and institutional participation, institutional accumulation (companies like MicroStrategy and other corporate treasuries adopting Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset) could push demand for it to new highs. The proportion of institutional investors will likely grow, stabilizing price movements but also making Bitcoin more correlated with traditional markets. Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance (currently around 55%) could rise further as investors favor its ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù narrative over altcoins, especially if regulatory scrutiny tightens around smaller tokens. Bitcoin wallet growth will continue as adoption in emerging markets increases, with Bitcoin used as a hedge against local currency devaluation. Major corporations could start settling cross-border transactions in Bitcoin, while in regions with high inflation or de-dollarization trends central banks may increase interest in Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Countries like the U.S., the EU, and the UAE are likely to finalize crypto-friendly regulations , while other jurisdictions may clamp down on decentralized finance and self-custody to maintain control over financial systems. Closing thoughts With a loud explosion of excitement, Bitcoin shattered the $100K barrier, an achievement deemed nothing short of astonishing. Technical indicators, including the weekly Golden Cross and RSI, point toward the possibility of further growth, with projections suggesting a potential climb to $150K‚Äì$250K in this bull cycle. However, a healthy period of consolidation or correction would likely provide a stronger foundation for future price action. By 2025, Bitcoin may achieve what was once considered nearly impossible‚Äîestablishing itself as a major player in the global financial system.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,crypto.news,https://crypto.news/from-100k-to-250k-analyzing-bitcoins-bull-market-signals/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/37439786.jpeg

In a newly released Tether Insights publication , USDT-issuer Tether highlights the ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù growth of USDT in crypto wallets. ‚ÄúThe growth of USDT wallets has been extraordinary, increasing 71% in the past year and 129% the year before, driven primarily by wallets holding less than $1,000. This surge accelerated after the collapse of FTX when users chose to self-custody their USDT rather than keep it on centralized platforms. USDT‚Äôs momentum continued even after competitors like USDC and DAI de-pegged during the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, reinforcing its position as the stablecoin of choice for users worldwide.‚Äù Source: Tether According to Tether, the sheer quantity of low-balance wallets holding USDT proves the stablecoin‚Äôs reliability and practical usefulness. ‚ÄúThe prevalence of low-balance wallets is a feature, not a bug, highlighting USDT‚Äôs accessibility to users who might otherwise be unbanked. Moreover, the 29% reactivation rate of these wallets demonstrates that many users return to holding USDT whenever they have the funds, underscoring its reliability as a financial tool for those with limited access to traditional banking.‚Äù The largest stablecoin by market cap currently boasts a $1.38 billion market cap.

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address ‚Äì C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEMAGA.

37439615,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=625129,1733784623,Bitget targets US markets under Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto administration,"The new US administration is drawing in global investors with its strategic moves. With the forthcoming Trump administration‚Äôs expected pro-crypto approach, crypto exchange Bitget is exploring potential partnerships with US firms to secure a foothold in the country. BitGet CEO Gracy Chen said , ‚ÄúWe are revisiting a U.S. strategy, although we have not decided on anything yet[ ‚Ä¶] If we had a local partner who has many of those licenses already, then we could do a joint venture, for example. So we don‚Äôt need to go through all the applications. We might take that approach, but it‚Äôs not decided yet.‚Äù In a recent interview, the exchange‚Äôs CEO said that Bitget considered starting the process of getting US state licenses in early 2022. But after FTX went down, things didn‚Äôt look good. Chen added that the ‚Äúridiculously high‚Äù court costs and the possibility of going up against Coinbase directly made things worse. Even if Trump makes crypto regulations clearer in the US as president, newcomers will still have to deal with a mess of state-based licenses and different government agencies. Still, Bitget knows how to make partnerships that work for both parties. For example, its most recent partnership with the U.K. trading firm Archax helped it comply with British rules for financial advertising. Unfriendly US crypto regulations force companies overseas Crypto has been in regulatory trouble in the United States, especially under the Biden administration. During SEC‚Äôs Chair Gary Gensler‚Äôs tenure, several crypto exchanges, crypto investors, and traders have left America. Bitget‚Äôs planned entry to America shows faith in the new Trump administration. In April 2023, Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong said that the crypto exchange would consider leaving the US if the industry‚Äôs regulatory environment does not become clearer. Armstrong asserted, ‚ÄúI think the U.S. has the potential to be an important market for crypto, but right now, we are not seeing that regulatory clarity that we need I think in a number of years if we don‚Äôt see that regulatory clarity emerge in the U.S., we may have to consider investing more elsewhere in the world.‚Äù Regulatory uncertainties not only affected Coinbase. Its rival exchange, Bittrex, said it planned to exit the US, citing ‚Äúthe current U.S. regulatory and economic environment.‚Äù The reports followed a Wells Notice the crypto exchange had received from the SEC. In addition, Binance‚Äôs US arm, Binance.US, faced a market backlash that led the exchange to consider exiting America. The crypto lawfare later saw Changpeng Zhao (CZ) step down from leadership roles and pay $4 billion in fines. ‚ÄúBinance may choose to leave the U.S., which could make a resolution with the SEC easier,‚Äù says Philip Moustakis, a partner at New York-based law firm Seward & Kissel. ‚ÄúIf Binance were to agree to leave the United States and shut down all operations in the United States and no longer access the U.S. capital markets and investors, I think it might be easier for them to find that resolution.‚Äù Maybe things will be different under Donald Trump. Earlier today, his son ‚Äì Eric Trump, said that the United States could become a global crypto hub with ‚Äòsensible regulations.‚Äô A Step-By-Step System To Launching Your Web3 Career and Landing High-Paying Crypto Jobs in 90 Days.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitget-targets-us-markets-under-trumps/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37439615.jpeg

The attackers gained access through an elaborate scheme involving malware distributed via Telegram. $50M Radiant Capital DeFi Hack The breach, first discovered on October 16, 2024, prompted Radiant to partner with cybersecurity firms like Mandiant, zeroShadow, Hypernative, and SEAL 911 to investigate and mitigate the damage. According to the official blog post , the attack was traced back to September 11, 2024, when a Radiant developer received a Telegram message from someone impersonating a former contractor. The message, crafted to appear harmless, requested feedback on a supposed career-related PDF file linked to smart contract auditing. The sender convincingly spoofed a legitimate website, reducing suspicion. Once the file, titled Penpie_Hacking_Analysis_Report.zip, was opened, a macOS backdoor malware named INLETDRIFT was delivered. The malware communicated with an external server and appeared harmless by displaying a realistic PDF. Despite Radiant‚Äôs adherence to rigorous security protocols, including transaction simulations and payload verifications, the malware evaded detection by manipulating front-end transaction data. Developers unknowingly signed off on malicious transactions, believing they were legitimate. The attackers‚Äô planning rendered the intrusion nearly undetectable during routine checks. zeroShadow, a Web3 security solutions provider, has also corroborated Radiant Capital‚Äôs assessment that the hack was the work of North Korea-linked actors. In a statement on December 9, the platform said, ‚ÄúWe also attribute the Radiant Capital October 16 incident to DPRK with high confidence based on multiple indicators that we have gathered on and off chain. We have tracked the movements to Hyperliquid as stemming from Radiant users failing to revoke permissions, and not the initial incident‚Äôs stolen funds.‚Äù Radiant‚Äôs TVL Down by Over 97% This Year Radiant Capital is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that integrates cross-chain capabilities through the use of LayerZero technology. DefiLlama‚Äôs latest figures place its total value locked (TVL) at a little over $6 million. The October 16 hack is not the first time Radiant has been compromised this year. Back in January, a smart contract vulnerability was exploited , costing the platform $4.5 million, during which its TVL was significantly higher, surpassing $300 million, highlighting a significant decline in locked assets over the course of the year despite the bull run.

This marks a 13% increase seen over the past month. As revealed by CoinGecko data, this surge is fueled by growing interest in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms with lucrative yield opportunities. This indicates a significant surge in the adoption and utilization of stablecoins; digital assets pegged to stable currencies like the US dollar. Why Are Stablecoins Booming? The sharp rise in stablecoin capitalization reflects a broader trend in investor behavior . Coinbase analysts David Duong and David Han attributed this surge to the high yields offered by DeFi lending protocols. Leading DeFi platforms such as Aave and Compound have seen annual rates spike to 10-20%. This increased rate has attracted users seeking significant returns on their investments in a decentralized ecosystem. According to the analysts, this influx of funds began gaining momentum around November 5. This coincided with Donald Trump‚Äôs unexpected victory in the U.S. presidential election. The timing also aligned with the doubling of Circle‚Äôs USDC deposit rates on Aave over the same period. Lending Protocols Hit Record Highs The stablecoin market cap‚Äôs growth occurred when DeFi lending protocols‚Äô Total Value Locked (TVL) reached an all-time high of $54 billion. According to DeFiLlama‚Äôs data, this surpassed the previous peak of $52 billion during the last crypto bull run. One standout performer is Ethena‚Äôs yield-bearing token, sUSDe. The token‚Äôs annual percentage yield (APY) soared to over 24% in November, up from 13% earlier in the month. However, projections suggest this APY may dip below 19% in the coming weeks as market conditions evolve. However, the appeal of double-digit returns continues to attract investors. Beyond traditional stablecoins, newer on-chain assets are also attracting attention. HyperLiquid‚Äôs HYPE token and AI-driven agent protocols are offering even higher yields. Although, these tokens are accessible only to participants engaging directly with blockchain networks. This exclusivity drives more investors to interact with decentralized platforms, increasing the overall on-chain activity. Coinbase analysts highlighted this trend , noting significant growth in borrowing, lending, and trading on decentralized exchanges. The Ripple Effect on Crypto Majors The growing stablecoin market cap reflects a wider recovery and renewed interest in the crypto market. This resurgence is visible in several areas, such as rising trading volumes on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Also, there has been increased borrowing and lending activity within the DeFi ecosystem. These trends are supported by strong price performances from major crypto assets like Bitcoin , which often signal broader confidence in the market.

As we approach the next altcoin season, Best Wallet, Sui, and Dogwifhat display signs of massive breakouts with fundamental and technical strength. Best Wallet raises $2.4 million Best Wallet token is a viral presale for a next-generation crypto wallet. The wallet is already up and running, providing features such as Best DEX, which connects to over 200 exchanges to get users the best price, alongside ‚ÄúUpcoming Tokens,‚Äù which offers early access to vetted presales.

Sui‚Äôs ecosystem is thriving, with its total value locked (TVL) recently reaching a new all-time high (ATH) of $1.75 billion. Similarly, the SUI token value has entered price discovery, currently at $4.28.

But beneath the surface ‚Äì at the product, developer and decision-making levels ‚Äì the original smart contracts platform continues to take a beating from Solana, one of its closest competitors.  The threat may not yet be existential. Ethereum and its many closely-linked networks are still the most important, influential, and largest platforms for decentralized finance. That lead is beginning to erode, however, with many newcomers to crypto choosing Solana's speed and low fees.  It's enough for some of Ethereum's most vocal backers to muse if the network needs to shift to a war footing.  ""Ethereum has been at peacetime its entire life,"" ETH maximalist David Hoffman said on a recent episode of his podcast, Bankless. ""Today, more people are thinking this period of Ethereum's life has come to an end.""  The dynamic was further punctuated Monday with news that longtime Ethereum ecosystem developer Max Resnick was moving into Solana's orbit, abandoning his job at the developer studio Consensys.  ""There's just so much more possibility and potential energy in Solana,"" Resnick said in an interview with CoinDesk. He framed the decision as rooted in his own career path, but noted ""frustration"" with Ethereum's inability to adapt contributed to the move.  He criticized a culture of ossification that gets in the way of progress. Ethereum lacks a streamlined process for making quick changes. Some see that as a point of strength for a decentralized network, while others, like Resnick, see it as a hindrance for long-term success.  Speed of an iceberg  Ethereum is rather notorious for being a somewhat unwieldy technical beast of a network. Its developer community looks toward co-founder Vitalik Buterin's annual ""roadmaps"" as a benchmark in tracking Ethereum's sluggish march of progress. A number of important changes may still be years away.  While Ethereum's decision-making may not be as purposely disjointed and ineffective as Bitcoin's, the network still contends with an unhealthy degree of internal politics, said Resnick. Big, important discussions over improving the network ""are happening in Vitalik's DMs,"" he said.  ""If you do need to make rapid changes to keep up with competition, which I think Ethereum has to for the first time now, then you are really going to need to change that process up somehow.""  It was enough to prompt Resnick to search for a new home, and to land at Solana. He took a job at Anza, a spinoff of Solana Labs that is charged with building its core client. He said he's a fan of Solana's ability to move fast in the face of competition.  In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Dankard Feist, an Ethereum Foundation researcher, commended Resnick for ""finally opening the Overton window to speak about stuff that isn't perfect in Ethereum land. ... In the long term, we need to build a good product, can't do that without open criticism.""   Off the iceberg  One startling moment in the brewing fight between Solana and Ethereum came last week from Pudgy Penguins, one of the best-known NFT collections on Ethereum. The team behind Pudgy Penguins is launching a token, called PENGU, but doing so on the Solana network, not on the NFTs' home of Ethereum.  The shock announcement spurred plenty of hand wringing on crypto twitter.  At the least, commentators took the decision as evidence of Solana's superiority as a retail-friendly chain when compared to Ethereum. Many other ETH-native projects have sidestepped main-chain woes without leaving Ethereum entirely. They build on layer-2 networks that are built on top of Ethereum. Meanwhile, PENGU is completely off the iceberg.  Ethereum researcher Justin Drake was unfazed by the competition in an interview with CoinDesk published last week. According to him, Solana does not put enough priority on ""health"" to win in the long run.  Resnick sees it differently. And he claims he's not the only one.  ""There are many people in ETH ‚Äì many of whom have made much bigger contributions than I have ‚Äì who are frustrated about the state of Ethereum and are asking for change, and who are saying, 'hey, if these changes don't happen I don't know how much longer I will work here,"" he said.

This asset could be a game-changer as traditional coins lose appeal. CYBRO moves up listing after 450% surge and $7 million presale CYBRO , an AI-driven multichain platform, is fast-tracking its listing on major exchanges after a presale that amassed $7 million and nearly 20,000 investors. As a frontrunner in the decentralized finance (DeFi) revolution, CYBRO has already caught the attention of the crypto community, carving out its place in the sector. In the presale, CYBRO‚Äôs token price rocketed by 450%, moving from $0.01 to $0.055, with a listing price of $0.06 on the horizon. The significant presale success has analysts excited about the token‚Äôs growth potential, with demand showing no signs of slowing down. CYBRO‚Äôs mission is clear: Democratize DeFi with solutions that make staking, farming, and lending accessible to everyone. During its presale, CYBRO hit several key milestones: CYBRO app launch: The platform introduced over 30 vaults with competitive APYs, designed to suit various investment strategies and risk appetites. Blast Index launch: A seamless one-click investment option that integrates with lending protocols, simplifying DeFi participation for both new and seasoned investors. Platform development: Laying the foundation for a more streamlined, user-focused DeFi ecosystem that aims to expand the boundaries of decentralized finance. CYBRO plans to build on its early success by adding features like leverage farming, lending aggregators, and enhanced AI-powered tools ‚Äî all of which are set to enhance its user experience through 2025. This advanced toolkit aims to make CYBRO a major player in the DeFi world. As interest in AI-driven financial platforms continues to grow, the timing couldn‚Äôt be better. With the momentum from its successful presale and the upcoming listing at $0.06, CYBRO is poised to attract increased attention from both retail and institutional investors.

It enables decentralized peer-to-peer transactions without a central authority. Created by Satoshi Nakamoto, it offers an electronic cash system. Unlike physical coins, Bitcoin operates as a distributed ledger across network nodes, eliminating the need for intermediaries like banks. Transactions are verified through mining, where miners solve complex puzzles to validate them and receive bitcoins as rewards. The system is designed to be resilient against fraud. With a capped supply of 21 million bitcoins, the network undergoes a ‚Äúhalving‚Äù about every 4 years, reducing miners‚Äô rewards by half. This structure positions Bitcoin as a strong alternative to traditional financial systems. Ethereum Ethereum is a proof-of-stake blockchain known for its smart contracts and large ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). It supports DeFi and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon, which improve transaction efficiency. Created by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum has evolved significantly, transitioning to proof-of-stake with the Merge. Ether (ETH) is central to the ecosystem, enabling transactions, rewarding stakers, and serving as a tradable asset and collateral.

Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, allows users to store value, make payments, and stake within the network. Cardano utilizes the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, offering a more energy-efficient alternative. The blockchain is structured into two layers: the Settlement Layer for handling transactions and the Computing Layer for executing smart contracts. This architecture enhances the platform‚Äôs efficiency, potentially supporting up to a million transactions per second. BNB BNB is the digital currency that powers the Binance ecosystem. It started in June 2017 as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum but now works across Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain. BNB is used for paying fees, creating tokens, and moving assets. It supports smart contracts using Proof-of-Staked Authority, which allows users to earn rewards by staking. BNB also offers fee discounts on Binance.com and is accepted by third-party services. Every quarter, Binance reduces BNB‚Äôs supply through burns, aiming to bring down the total from 200 million to 100 million to enhance its value. Conclusion In the current market, traditional altcoins like BTC, ETH, ADA, and BNB may offer limited short-term potential. In contrast, CYBRO emerges as a technologically advanced DeFi platform that seeks to provide investors with exceptional opportunities to enhance their earnings. Leveraging AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain, CYBRO will deliver high staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. Its seamless deposit and withdrawal processes will ensure a superior user experience. With a strong commitment to transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO has attracted significant interest from crypto whales and influencers, positioning it as a promising project in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape.

37437753,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=659480,1733781654,Analyst Sets $4.40 XRP Target As 3rd-Straight Bull Pennant Forms,"An analyst has explained how XRP could eventually reach a $4.40 price target based on the bull pennant pattern that has formed in its 4-hour price. XRP Has Just Shown Its Third Straight Bull Pennant Pattern In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed the bull pennant patterns that have formed for XRP recently. The ‚Äúbull pennant‚Äù refers to a formation from technical analysis (TA) that occurs after an asset shows consolidation inside a triangle following a sharp uptrend. The pattern is made up of two parts: a pole and a ‚Äòpennant.‚Äô The pole corresponds to the initial uptrend in the asset‚Äôs price. This is exactly the same kind of structure that precedes the consolidation phase in a ‚Äúbull flag.‚Äù Related Reading: Bitcoin Flash Crash Causes $710 Million In Crypto Long Liquidations Where a bull pennant diverges from a bull flag is in terms of how the consolidation of the asset occurs. In a flag, the price moves between two parallel lines, while in a pennant, it‚Äôs between two converging trendlines. The upper line of the pennant is likely to be a source of resistance, meaning tops can probably occur at it. Similarly, the lower line may support the price. A break out of either of these levels can suggest a continuation of the trend in that direction; escapes above the pennant are bullish, while falls under it can lead to a bearish outcome. Like the bull pennant, a ‚Äòbear‚Äô pennant can also form in an asset‚Äôs price. This pattern works very much like the bull pennant, except for the fact that its pole corresponds to a downtrend instead. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the bull pennant that XRP is traveling inside right now: As is visible above, XRP attempted a retest of the pennant upper level yesterday, but the asset appears to have found rejection as its price has gone down since then. It‚Äôs possible that the coin may find support at the lower level next, which is located at $2.25. The cryptocurrency is slowly moving towards the apex of the pattern, meaning a break in either direction might be on the cards in the near future. As for which of the two directions is more likely, perhaps history may hold the answer. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At Crossroads: Will It Stabilize and Surge Again? From the chart, it‚Äôs apparent that this isn‚Äôt the first bull pennant that the asset has shown during the past month. Both of the previous two instances ended in the price finding a bullish breakout. Thus, XRP may obtain a similar outcome this time as well. As for how far the break might take the asset, Ali has mentioned a target of $4.40. This is based on the fact that pennant breakouts are generally of the same length as the pole. ‚ÄúWe should all be praying for a retest of $2.25 to buy the dip and target $4.40!‚Äù says the analyst. XRP Price Following its drawdown during the past day, XRP has plunged to the $2.39 level.

With the latest investment, the firm now holds 191 Bitcoins at $18 million, translating to an average price of $92,728 per BTC. On November 12, the company declared its intention to hold over 90% of its current and future reserves in BTC. The ‚ÄúBitcoin-first‚Äù strategy was rolled out with an initial target of $120 million in the coin. Genius Group made an initial purchase worth $10 million in BTC the same week to show commitment to the strategy. The firm has been making weekly purchases , investing an average of $2 million in the coin to add to its reserve. Corporate firms are racing to stock BTC Genius Group is not the only corporation turning to Bitcoin; several corporate firms are adopting BTC investments. Earlier, there were reports of Microstrategy acquiring 21,550 Bitcoins, amounting to $2.1 billion. This acquisition has made the company hold approximately 423,650 BTC, translating to $25.6 billion. With over 400,000 BTC, the company controls around 2% of the total Bitcoin supply. It is accurate to say that Microstrategy is among the prolific BTC enablers. Apart from Genius and Microstrategy, Riot Platforms deliberately attempts to consolidate its space in the Bitcoin ecosystem. The firm is planning to raise $500 million to purchase more BTC. Over the past year, several firms have raised funds to buy Bitcoin, underscoring the value of Bitcoins for corporate firms. Corporate and state adoption are securing Bitcoin‚Äôs future As firms continue to invest Bitcoin in their reserves and seal their positions in the BTC arena, countries are also taking notice. In 2021, El Salvador made a bold move in the crypto space. The country legalized BTC and embraced it as legal tender. Since then, the country has seen its BTC bets as rewarding. Slovenia has also made crypto lucrative by creating an environment for mining with zero VAT tax while offering tax write-offs for crypto trading. Germany is considering crypto private money, allowing people to trade freely. President-elect Donald Trump recently said he will develop a strategic BTC reserve for the country. He has shown signs of living up to his words by convening the crypto advisory council to help him with this project. Recently, Trump appointed David Sacks to be the AI and crypto czar and hinted that he is determined to deliver on his crypto voting agenda. It is safe to assume that other countries will most probably follow America‚Äôs entry into BTC. We must wait and see if there will be a BTC scramble.

These coins have become the cheeky underdogs of cryptocurrency, thriving on humour and community spirit while quietly delivering some serious gains. For those chasing quick flips and rapid returns, a new batch of meme coins has popped onto the radar‚Äîand they‚Äôre stirring up excitement like a sizzling barbecue on a sunny arvo. At the top of the list is BTFD Coin , smashing milestones with its record-breaking presale. With over $2.6 million raised and billions of tokens snapped up, this coin is on a trajectory that could redefine short-term success. Joining the hype train are Peanut the Squirrel, a quirky token tapping into nostalgia, and ANDY, a project combining community-driven innovation with playful branding. If you‚Äôre after the best meme coins to buy and hold for short-term gains, these three should be your top contenders. BTFD Coin: A Success Story in the Making When it comes to short-term opportunities, BTFD Coin is hitting all the right notes. Standing for ‚ÄúBuy the Dip,‚Äù this project has turned a popular crypto mantra into a booming presale event. With over 44 billion tokens sold and $2.6 million raised so far, it‚Äôs fair to say this coin‚Äôs presale has lit up the market like a campfire under a starry sky. Why is BTFD Coin such a hot prospect for short-term gains? It‚Äôs all about momentum. The presale buzz, coupled with a high-utility ecosystem, has analysts predicting a strong price surge once the coin hits decentralised exchanges. Its staking platform, offering a hefty 90% average APY, and its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game add layers of utility that go beyond the usual meme coin hype. Now, let‚Äôs put on our investor hats. Suppose you invest $4,000 in Stage 10 of the presale, where tokens are priced at $0.0001. That nets you a whopping 40 million BTFD Coins. If the price rises to $0.0006 shortly after launch‚Äîan entirely plausible scenario, given the presale performance‚Äîyou‚Äôd be looking at $24,000. That‚Äôs the kind of short-term gain that makes you feel like you‚Äôve struck gold while fossicking in the bush. With its vibrant community, tangible utility, and presale fireworks, BTFD Coin is undoubtedly one of the best meme coins to buy and hold for short-term gains. Peanut the Squirrel: Nostalgia Meets Crypto Few things capture the heart like a dash of nostalgia, and Peanut the Squirrel is banking on it. Inspired by a beloved cartoon rodent (you know the one), this token is spreading joy while delivering swift returns for savvy investors. It‚Äôs like finding a box of Shapes in your cupboard when you thought you‚Äôd run out‚Äîunexpected and satisfying. Priced at $1.36, Peanut the Squirrel is still in its early days, making it a bargain for those looking to get in before it scurries up the charts. The project‚Äôs roadmap includes a gamified ecosystem where players can complete fun tasks to earn Peanut rewards. Think of it as a virtual treasure hunt with a nostalgic twist. Analysts are optimistic about its short-term potential, with many predicting a jump to $3.10 next year. For a small investment, Peanut the Squirrel could deliver quick returns while keeping things light-hearted and fun. If you‚Äôre after a coin with charm and a strong FOMO factor, this could be your ticket. ANDY: The Community-Driven Powerhouse ANDY takes a slightly different approach, blending meme coin humour with a focus on community empowerment. Named after a cheeky and lovable character, ANDY aims to create a decentralised space where users have a say in the coin‚Äôs future. It‚Äôs like heading to a backyard cricket match where everyone gets a turn at bat‚Äîfair, inclusive, and loads of fun. Currently trading at $0.0003407, ANDY is attracting attention for its unique DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation) structure. Investors can vote on key project decisions, making it a truly community-driven coin. This engagement, combined with its clever marketing campaigns, has analysts predicting a 232.85% price surge, reaching $ 0.000983 within weeks of its next major announcement. The project frequently updates its community on progress and upcoming milestones, creating a buzz that‚Äôs hard to ignore. For short-term gains with a touch of community spirit, ANDY is well worth a closer look. Why These Meme Coins Are Short-Term Winners Meme coins are like a hot batch of freshly fried chips‚Äîthey‚Äôre best enjoyed quickly but can leave a lasting impression when done right. The market has evolved, and these tokens are no longer just about jokes and internet memes. Projects like BTFD Coin, Peanut the Squirrel, and ANDY bring a mix of entertainment and opportunity, making them standout options for those looking to capitalise on short-term trends. Timing is everything when it comes to meme coins. The early presale stages or initial listing days are often when the biggest gains can be made. With BTFD Coin‚Äôs record-breaking presale, Peanut the Squirrel‚Äôs nostalgic charm, and ANDY‚Äôs innovative approach, the potential for quick wins has never been more exciting. The Bottom Line The meme coin market is bursting with opportunities, and these three tokens are leading the charge. BTFD Coin‚Äôs presale success , Peanut the Squirrel‚Äôs nostalgic appeal, and ANDY‚Äôs community-driven model make them the best meme coins to buy and hold for short-term gains. Don‚Äôt wait too long‚Äîthese coins move faster than a summer storm rolling in. Jump into the BTFD Coin presale today and be part of a project that‚Äôs set to light up the market.

Trump‚Äôs Tesla (TRUMTESLA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMTESLA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump‚Äôs Tesla can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump‚Äôs Tesla could become the next viral memecoin. Trump‚Äôs Tesla launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.

If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMTESLA.

Qubetics, Cardano, and Ripple (XRP) are among the Best Coins To Invest In December 2024. These projects represent innovation, growth potential, and significant opportunities for both short-term gains and long-term value. Qubetics is setting new standards in blockchain usability with its innovative Qubetics Wallet, designed for seamless and secure crypto asset management. Cardano (ADA) is climbing toward a critical breakout level, aiming for a potential rally to $1.40. Ripple (XRP), riding high on bullish sentiment, is projected to surge to $7-$10 in Q1 2025, fueled by the resolution of its legal battles and new product launches. Let‚Äôs explore why these coins stand out as the Best Coins To Invest In December 2024. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Crypto Wallet Technology The Qubetics Wallet is a cornerstone of the Qubetics Network‚Äôs comprehensive blockchain ecosystem. As crypto adoption surges globally, the need for secure, user-friendly wallet solutions has never been greater. The Qubetics Wallet is poised to address this demand, offering a seamless experience across various platforms, including iOS, Android, and desktop interfaces. Key Features of the Qubetics Wallet: Accessibility Across Devices : Designed to cater to all user preferences, ensuring a consistent experience across mobile and desktop platforms. Ease of Use : The intuitive interface empowers users to manage $TICS tokens and other digital assets with minimal complexity. Financial Empowerment : By enabling secure and efficient transactions, the wallet positions users to take control of their financial futures. Currently, in Presale Phase 12, Qubetics is capturing investor attention. $TICS tokens are priced at $0.031, with over $5.3 million raised, 8,000+ holders, and 300 million tokens sold. A 20% price hike in the final presale stage will elevate the token to $0.25, offering a potential 703.5% ROI. With its focus on innovation and accessibility, Qubetics is one of the best coins to invest in for long-term returns in 2024 and beyond. Cardano (ADA): Eyeing a Breakout to $1.40 Cardano (ADA) is showcasing strong bullish momentum, trading within an ascending channel and attempting to breach the critical $1.24 resistance level . While ADA has faced challenges at this resistance, analysts remain optimistic about its potential to break through. Price Targets : Top analysts like Sssebi and CW predict ADA could rally to $1.40 and potentially $1.50 upon a successful breakout. Impressive Performance : Cardano has seen a 23.4% weekly gain and a 271.5% monthly increase , with 24 green days over the past month‚Äîa testament to high buying activity. Technical Indicators : The 14-day RSI remains above the midline, signalling upward momentum. Cardano‚Äôs robust ecosystem and focus on sustainable development make it a strong contender for future growth. As it approaches a potential breakout, ADA is firmly positioned among the Best Coins To Invest In December 2024 in the current market. Ripple (XRP): Aiming for $7-$10 in Q1 2025 Ripple (XRP) has been at the centre of crypto market discussions due to its ongoing legal battle with the SEC and its potential to redefine cross-border payments. Recent developments suggest that Ripple could experience a significant price surge in Q1 2025. Bullish Predictions : Analysts forecast XRP could pump to $7-$10 in the first quarter of 2025, driven by the anticipated resolution of the Ripple-SEC legal case. New Product Launches : Ripple‚Äôs upcoming stablecoin, RLUSD, is expected to add momentum to its growth. Current Performance : XRP has corrected to the lower part of $2 , but its value has risen 68.2% on the weekly timeframe and 376.5% on the monthly chart . Market sentiment surrounding Ripple remains positive, with experts like JackTheRipper highlighting the impact of a potential political shift, including Donald Trump‚Äôs emergence, on Ripple‚Äôs trajectory. Why These Coins Stand Out For investors looking to maximise their returns, Qubetics, Cardano, and Ripple offer unique advantages: Qubetics is transforming crypto management with its user-friendly wallet and integrated ecosystem, offering unparalleled growth potential during its presale phase. Cardano demonstrates robust market performance and technical strength, positioning itself for a breakout to $1.40 or higher.

37437200,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=625135,1733780123,"Needham goes bull on Coinbase stock price, raises target to $420 a share","On Monday, equity analysts at Needham & Company increased their price target for Coinbase to $420 from their previous price target of $375 a share. The target review is quite familiar, as Needham had previously projected a 467% increase in Coinbase‚Äôs revenue in 2021. However, in this case, Needham projects a 12% increase from $375 in December 2024. By this raise, Needham‚Äôs analysts anticipate that Coinbase will generate substantial results in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the following year, giving the stock a ‚Äúbuy‚Äù rating. Needham analysts say retail activity is returning The analysts point to the improving market conditions and interest in cryptos as a factor. ‚ÄúThe price target increase is driven by significant retail activity returning to the crypto market, with December volumes on track to be the highest ever,‚Äù the analysts said . ‚ÄúElevated volatility, particularly with Bitcoin around $100,000, and a rise in altcoin activity are major contributors to this volume surge.‚Äù Coinbase‚Äôs shares have increased by more than 80% this year, especially following Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in the November presidential election. Also in the days around the presidential election, the company‚Äôs shares surged from less than $200 to over $300 per share. The analyst predicts that: ‚Äú For Q4 2024, total volume is expected to reach $435 billion, with revenue at $2.1 billion and EPS at $2.37 per share For 2025, revenue is projected at $8.9 billion with an EPS of $9.61 per share.‚Äù Many buyers who like crypto but are not confident enough to invest in the market see putting money into Coinbase as a roundabout way to bet on crypto. Altcoins trading activity is returning Reports say that the market value of all altcoins, besides the top 10 crypto, has gone over $425 billion for the first time since November 2021. Last week, this significant target was reached, marking a big change in the bitcoin market. Altcoin Market Cap has Weekly Closed above $425bn (black) for the first time since November 2021 #BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/TtvCpdeiTA ‚Äî Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) December 9, 2024 The rise in the market cap of altcoins underscores the increasing interest and investment in crypto that is not as well-known as the prominent ones, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. This trend indicates that investors are diversifying their portfolios and investigating opportunities in digital assets that are less well-known. The altcoin market has also experienced a 138% increase in capital inflows over the past five weeks. The surge was led by utility coins such as XRP, XLM, ADA, and VET, as well as newer cryptocurrencies and meme coins, which experienced substantial gains. In the forthcoming weeks and months, analysts predict that the altcoin market will continue to expand, with Trump assuming the office of the President. Is the alt season permanent ‚Äì 2025 predictions CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju recently opined that the alt season may no longer be driven by capital rotation from Bitcoin, Cryptopolitan reported . Bitcoin has been outperformed by 73% of the top 50 altcoins in the past 90 days. The 75% threshold is being approached as this index has experienced a significant increase in the past few days. However, analysts think that the first month of 2025 will have some small declines. They stress how important it is to be careful in January 2025 and say that Bitcoin will drop below $95K and Ethereum will either test its all-time high (ATH) or even drop below it. Also, the altcoin market could experience a 30% to 50% drop during this time. According to predictions, the crypto market might pick up speed again from February to April 2025 before the end of the first quarter of 2025. Bitcoin could reach as much as $160,000, and Ethereum could reach around $10,000. That time will also be good for altcoins, and the market for them could reach a new all-time high.

The government plans to make Bitcoin acceptance voluntary for businesses, instead of mandatory, as part of the agreement. This policy adjustment aims to unlock additional international lending and finalize the loan deal within two to three weeks. The decision marks a significant shift in El Salvador's pioneering use of Bitcoin as legal tender, which was introduced in 2021 under President Nayib Bukele's administration. The IMF had previously expressed concerns over the risks associated with Bitcoin's mandatory acceptance, prompting the country to revise its stance.

37437550,https://blockworks.co/news/ethereum-researcher-joins-solana-anza,1733779800,Ethereum researcher Max Resnick makes surprise jump to Solana,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Max Resnick, who has in recent months become one of Ethereum‚Äôs more notable online figures, has joined Solana core development shop Anza, he announced on X today. Resnick previously worked at a Consensys subsidiary named Special Mechanisms Group and became known for his contrarian beliefs on Ethereum‚Äôs roadmap ‚Äî arguing that some thinking around layer-2s was misguided and Ethereum should focus on scaling the base layer . In classic crypto fashion, much of Resnick‚Äôs rising star originated on X: Kaito AI ranks him as having the 40th-highest mindshare on Crypto Twitter over the past three months. Consensys is a software company started by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin in 2014, and is perhaps best known for creating the MetaMask wallet. Anza is a Solana Labs spin-out that is responsible for continuing to develop the original Solana software. The move was celebrated in the Solana world, where Resnick‚Äôs move to Solana was viewed as something of a coup. For Ethereum, Resnick doesn‚Äôt quite reach household name status like Justin Drake or Dankrad Feist do, but another high-profile defection following Resnick‚Äôs could certainly ‚Äúraise some eyebrows,‚Äù said Paul Dylan-Ennis, a professor researching crypto at University College Dublin. Resnick‚Äôs transition to Anza was helped along by Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, who encouraged the researcher to take the leap, Resnick shared with me today. The process started around three months ago. Resnick was also considering moves to Ethereum layer-2s or non-MetaMask crypto wallets. Resnick said on X that he would be spending his first 100 days at Anza focusing on fee markets and consensus while getting up to speed on how Solana works at a core level. On a call today, Resnick added that his ‚Äúmoonshot‚Äù vision for Solana would be to add ‚Äúmultiple leaders‚Äù to the protocol. On Ethereum and Solana today, one so-called leader is chosen to propose a block for validators to check. Under this model, the single leader has a ‚Äúton‚Äù of economic power which makes the protocols economically inefficient, Resnick said. Having multiple leaders compete to propose blocks could put downward pressure on how much economic value leaders can extract from validators. Resnick credits himself with widening Ethereum‚Äôs overton window to allow for more serious conversations around how the layer-1 can scale, pointing out Ethereum Foundation researcher Dankrad Feist‚Äôs recent focus on scaling the L1 as an example. But ultimately, Resnick sees Solana‚Äôs culture as more open to unconventional ideas, such as having multiple leaders ‚Äî in comparison to Ethereum, which can tend to be bogged down by ‚Äúpolitical bullshit.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe ETH culture is really downstream of core development, and people who actually want to get things done are changing their personality, changing what they‚Äôre suggesting in order to make sure that they preserve political capital with the core dev community,‚Äù Resnick said.

With prices in quick retreat, bitcoin (BTC) at press time had fallen back to just above $95,000, down about 5% over the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH) was down 10% to $3,590.  The broader CoinDesk 20 Index was lower by more than 8% over the same time frame, led by roughly 20% dives for Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), and XRP (XRP).  Over $750 million worth of leveraged derivatives positions were liquidated across all digital assets over the past day, CoinGlass data shows, the ovewhelming majority of which were bullish bets. That puts today's flush almost on par with the August 5 crash and just trailing last Thursday's wild swing when BTC plunged to $90,000 from above $100,000.  There are some signs of waning momentum on the crypto markets, including declining exchange volumes and heavy profit-taking by long-term holders, analytics firm 10x Research pointed out in a Monday morning note.

Qubetics‚Äô jaw-dropping presale projections, Hedera‚Äôs historic year-to-date surge, and SUI‚Äôs bullish technical performance have thrown these coins into the spotlight. If you‚Äôre wondering whether these could be the best coins to join today , stick around‚Äîthe numbers are too exciting to ignore. While Hedera and SUI continue to make waves with price action and strategic moves, Qubetics promises to disrupt the crypto space with its innovative tokenised marketplace. Let‚Äôs dive into how these projects stack up and why they‚Äôre dominating conversations. Qubetics: Revolutionising the Market with $TICS The absence of a tokenised marketplace has been a thorn in the side of crypto investors for years. Illiquidity, lack of transparency, and restricted access to high-value opportunities keep countless investors sidelined. Enter Qubetics , a project laser-focused on fixing these real-world issues through its groundbreaking $TICS token. $TICS isn‚Äôt just another token; it‚Äôs a gateway to a fairer and more accessible investment landscape. It‚Äôs time we talk numbers‚Äîand they‚Äôre huge. At just $0.0311 during its presale, analysts predict a $0.25 price by presale‚Äôs end, translating to a whopping 703.21% ROI. That‚Äôs just the start. Once the presale wraps, $TICS could skyrocket to $10‚Äì15 after its mainnet launch, delivering up to 48,092.91% ROI. Now imagine this: what if you invested $1,000 today? By the presale‚Äôs end, your $1,000 would morph into $7,032. By the time $TICS hits $15, you‚Äôre staring at an astronomical $480,929. It‚Äôs no wonder this token has the crypto world‚Äôs undivided attention. But Qubetics isn‚Äôt just about financial returns. The tokenised marketplace tackles regulatory hurdles, illiquidity, and dependency on opaque third parties, creating a more secure and transparent ecosystem for investors. It‚Äôs solving problems that its predecessors left behind‚Äîand with style. For more information, please watch this video . Hedera: Surging 310% YTD and Still Climbing Hedera Hashgraph‚Äôs $HBAR is having a year to remember. With a staggering 310% year-to-date surge, Hedera‚Äôs innovative use of distributed ledger technology continues to attract institutional and retail investors alike. What makes Hedera one of the best coins to join today? Its consistent performance and a growing roster of enterprise partnerships‚ÄîGoogle, IBM, and Boeing are just a few names backing Hedera. Analysts are now forecasting $HBAR to hit $5 in the near term, a massive leap from its current value. For a $1,000 investment today, hitting that $5 mark would see your portfolio grow fivefold. Hedera‚Äôs focus on scalability and energy efficiency is clearly paying off, making it a project that‚Äôs impossible to overlook. SUI: Breaking Resistance, Building Momentum SUI‚Äôs recent price action has been nothing short of thrilling. The project recently flipped the $3.8 resistance level into solid support, setting the stage for a major breakout. Analysts are eyeing SUI as a top contender for the next big wave in crypto growth. SUI‚Äôs unique design, focusing on decentralised application scalability, has made it a favourite among developers. But its real charm lies in its technicals. If the current bullish trend holds, analysts predict SUI could double or even triple its value in the coming months. A $1,000 investment today could easily turn into $3,000 by the next bull cycle. The Final Word Whether it‚Äôs Qubetics‚Äô staggering ROI projections, Hedera‚Äôs trailblazing partnerships, or SUI‚Äôs bullish momentum, these coins aren‚Äôt just making headlines‚Äîthey‚Äôre making waves. Each project addresses unique market gaps while delivering returns that are too enticing to ignore. Miss out, and you might be kicking yourself a few months from now. Take action today. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned investor or a curious newbie, the window for joining these projects is wide open‚Äîbut not for long. Don‚Äôt wait. The best time to act is now.

37436504,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=625061,1733778608,Justin Sun dumps $119M Ethereum as price soars past $4K ‚Äì What‚Äôs happening?,"Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, executed a transfer of 29,920 ETH valued at $119.7 million to HTX following Ethereum‚Äôs impressive surge past the $4,000 mark. The transaction has sparked discussions regarding Sun‚Äôs strategy‚Äîwhether he‚Äôs cashing out or setting the stage for additional profits. Justin Sun acquired 392,474 ETH for $1.19 billion at an average price of $3,027 between February and August. Fast forward to December, he appears to be booking profit. He recently deposited 20,000 ETH valued at $76.3 million to HTX, precisely on December 5. The transaction happened just as ETH crossed $3,800. Later on December 8, Sun also deposited 29,920 ETH worth $119.7 million to HTX, as per Spot On Chain , following the ETH price surpassing $4,000. With Ether‚Äôs crossing the $4,000 price mark, it‚Äôs estimated that Justin Sun has generated a profit of $366 million, exclusive of staking rewards and airdrops. The Tron founder also transferred 41,630 ETH ($145.9 million) to centralized exchanges since early November, with 39,000 ETH being sent to HTX and 2,630 ETH being sent to Poloniex at an average price of $3,505. In addition, Sun deposited staking rewards to HTX, which included 322,119 EIGEN tokens valued at $1.44 million and 175,021 ETHFI tokens valued at $516,000. This move shows that his plan for making money with Ethereum during the bull run was sound. Ethereum‚Äôs recent trading activity Despite the sell-offs, Ethereum has made incredible steps, advancing toward the psychological $4K resistance zone. This price level is a significant area of selling pressure and is in alignment with Ethereum‚Äôs yearly high. The rejection at this line has recently resulted in a slight decline, indicating that buyers are finding it challenging to overcome the resistance. Although the price has encountered some resistance, it is probable that ETH purchasers will make another attempt to surpass $4K. Even so, a period of sideways movement is anticipated before that as the market absorbs the most recent gains. ETH‚Äôs market structure is positive, as it consistently results in higher highs and higher lows. However, a breach of the channel‚Äôs lower trendline could suggest a decline in bullish momentum, potentially leading to a mid-term pullback toward the $3.5K support level. This week, the price of Ethereum (ETH) reached $4,017, representing a 6.9% weekly increase and a 27.8% monthly increase. The favorable sentiment remains strong despite the fact that the price of ETH has decreased by 4.6% in the past 24 hours to $3,814. Ethereum ETFs also recorded $837 million in net inflows last week, setting a new record. According to analysts, the momentum is partially attributed to the substantial market support provided by robust ETF inflows. Altcoins verses Bitcoin Although several altcoins experienced substantial gains over the weekend, the majority are currently experiencing a decline. XRP is one of the worst performers, having lost over 6% of its value and plummeted to a level well below $2.4. Similar losses have been observed in DOGE, TRX, SHIB, and XLM. DOT has experienced an even greater decline, as have CRO, VET, FIL, and FET. On the other hand, Avalanche and Ethereum have experienced a 2% decrease, while SOL and BNB have experienced a 4% decline. Since yesterday, the cumulative market capitalization of all crypto assets has decreased by approximately $100 billion, reaching $3.750 trillion. On Friday, Bitcoin reached a peak of $102,000, and by Sunday evening, it had fallen to $101,300. But rejections doomed both efforts, sending the value spiraling downward. Following a little daily drop, bitcoin is currently trading at around $98k.

Crying Kamala (CRYKAMA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CRYKAMA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Crying Kamala can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crying Kamala could become the next viral memecoin. Crying Kamala launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crying Kamala on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Crying Kamala by entering its contract address ‚Äì 5eCJhSGBUN4YwJHLU9ZcWjrjmoufVznjzNBHfo4TN1P7 ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner.

The world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has fallen below the $100,000 level and is trading at $96,142 at the time of writing. Most of the crypto news today appeared positive. Major Bitcoin investor MicroStrategy announced that it had purchased another $2.1 billion worth of Bitcoin at an average price of $98,783, and the company now owns $25.6 billion worth of Bitcoin. Meanwhile, some Amazon shareholders have suggested that the company follow MicroStrategy‚Äôs lead and hold 5% of its assets in Bitcoin. The more embedded BTC becomes in the mainstream financial system, the better it is likely to perform, so it‚Äôs an interesting development. In more negative headlines, media outlets reported that El Salvador would be rolling back some of its Bitcoin laws in order to secure loan agreements from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank. El Salvador invested heavily in Bitcoin a few years ago, making it legal tender in the country in 2021 and accumulating a significant amount of BTC. The country has made hundreds of millions in profits from this move. Related News: El Salvador, Which Was Preparing for an Agreement with the IMF, Has Backed Down on Bitcoin (BTC)! Ultimately, the most likely reason for the pullback appears to be that investors are taking a break, which is healthy during bull markets. On the other hand, the decline in question also triggered liquidations in the cryptocurrency market. With the impact of Bitcoin losing about 4% in value in the last 24 hours, there was a massive liquidation wave of $864 million in the cryptocurrency market. $767 million of these were in long positions. Interestingly, neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum experienced the most liquidation. The cumulative liquidation observed in ‚Äúother altcoins‚Äù, excluding the largest cryptocurrencies, was the most liquidated in the last 24 hours. Ethereum came next with $111 million, and Bitcoin came third with $105 million. On the individual altcoin side, the most liquidations were observed in Dogecoin, Solana, XRP and PEPE, respectively.

In a new interview on CNBC, Lee says that BTC‚Äôs strong rallies over the last quarter are a sign that investors have a high-risk appetite and that future rallies in the S&P 500 are to be expected. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really telling us investors are pro-risk. I do think it also just signals how much capital has been idle for the last couple of years, either parked in money market cash or waiting to see if the economy survives.

Looking at the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate-cutting cycle, Lee says that contrary to popular consensus, fewer rate cuts next year may actually be better for risk assets because it elongates the Fed‚Äôs dovish easing cycle. ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a conceptual change that the market has to get used to which is, let‚Äôs say earlier this year when the Fed started cutting, people thought five cuts is good for stocks in 2025, so if the number gets reduced, it‚Äôs bearish. I think as we get into 2025, the market is going to shift into thinking the fewest cuts possible next year is the best case because it elongates the dovish cycle.

This latest acquisition brings the company's total Bitcoin reserves to 423,650 BTC, valued at around $41.7 billion, with an average purchase price of $60,324 per coin. The company's aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy, known as the '21/21 Plan,' aims to raise $42 billion over three years to continue its accumulation of the cryptocurrency. This move has drawn increased scrutiny due to the firm's reliance on a combination of equity and fixed-income securities sales to finance these rapidly increasing acquisitions. Michael Saylor, the company's executive chairman, has predicted that MicroStrategy could own 2% of all Bitcoin by 2045, with a bullish case of 49 million BTC. This is the fifth consecutive week of Bitcoin purchases, with the company achieving a Bitcoin yield of 43.2% for the quarter-to-date and 68.7% year-to-date.

The share price of Nvidia ‚Äî Big Tech‚Äôs darling that has surged almost 200% this year ‚Äî slipped on Monday on news that China opened a probe into the chipmaker on suspicions of anti-monopoly law violations. The investigation comes days after President Joe Biden expanded limits on exports of semiconductors to China. This is part of an effort, the administration says, to limit China‚Äôs access to cutting-edge AI technology. China last week also banned exports of three rare minerals and imposed new sanctions on US defense firms and executives. It‚Äôs starting to look like a full-on supply chain war in the final weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. After opting to respond with parallel tariffs against the US during Trump‚Äôs first term, the Chinese government appears to be taking a more aggressive approach this time around.

The offering is intended for accredited institutional investors who, within three days from the initial transaction, will also be offered an additional $75 million purchase option. Riot intends to use the money to buy more Bitcoin and for general corporate purposes. Convertible notes are a popular way to raise finance, where investors can convert debt into shares of the issuing company. The flexibility of the structure might attract investors with equity focuses and allow companies to raise substantial capital without early equity dilution. The Trend of Bitcoin Financing Riot‚Äôs move comes as part of a wider trend of cryptocurrency-focused firms relying on convertible debt to finance Bitcoin buying. Fellow major Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings recently increased the size of its note sale to $850 million, with the option to purchase an additional $150 million, taking its total reserves of BTC above $3.3 billion. Japanese firm Metaplanet has also used share sales to finance more than $45 million in Bitcoin buying. These strategies underscore the growing confidence in Bitcoin as a corporate asset and an alternative to traditional cash reserves. Pioneers of Bitcoin Debt Financing Michael Saylor, founder of MicroStrategy, was among the first to pioneer the use of convertible debt to buy Bitcoin, setting an industry benchmark. Saylor, once skeptical of cryptocurrencies, is now one of its leading advocates, predicting a future where Bitcoin captures a significant share of global cash reserves. His vision has inspired other corporations to adopt similar approaches. Crypto industry leaders, including Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, have also urged global firms to incorporate Bitcoin into their corporate strategies, with some suggesting it as a reserve asset and a payment option. A Global Race for Bitcoin With the supply of Bitcoin capped at 21 million, competition for reserves is growing tougher. Analysts predict an open race among corporations and nations to capture the rare digital asset. The new administration in the U.S., with President-elect Donald Trump seen as pro-Bitcoin, could further boost the trend by promoting policies that are friendly toward cryptocurrency adoption. Riot Platforms‚Äô latest raise underlines its commitment to Bitcoin, setting the company at the front and center of the cryptocurrency ecosystem .

37435843,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=625112,1733777428,Reddit rolls out new AI feature for search,"Reddit said on Monday it is rolling out a new AI feature known as Reddit Answers to help people quickly find answers based on user posts. The company revealed that Reddit Answers will be available on their homepage through a new button. The new link to the page will take users to the interface where they can ask AI questions, just as they do with ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other generative AI services. While the tool is accessible to a few, the company has indicated a desire to bring it to more languages and locations. Reddit says this will enhance search experiences Reddit‚Äôs AI-generated answers, unlike those of AI-powered chat and search tools, are sourced from posts made by users of the platform and not from around the web. The company said a small portion of Reddit users in the US will have the privilege to access the Reddit Answers feature as part of an initial test before it is made public to all users by the company. According to Reddit spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt, Reddit Answers can also pick up on things happening on Reddit within minutes. Reddit‚Äôs vice president of product Serkan Piantino talking to CNBC , said Reddit has been testing the AI answers feature for almost six months now and is part of the company‚Äôs plans to better the platform and aid how people get answers. The AI tool will answer with a bullet-point list of tips if say, a user asks AI Answers how to make modifications in a kitchen to a specific model. To access answers, a user can click the links in the answers and be redirected to related Reddit posts. Piantino added, ‚ÄúReddit Answers is more about building a bridge to the content than it is about being a replacement for it.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe company wants people to use the feature to access more Reddit content as opposed to merely reading AI-generated summaries.‚Äù Piantino. According to him, people will be able to use Reddit Answers to query any topic except those deemed NSFW, or not safe for work. Search provides ‚Äúfocused‚Äù investment for Reddit Earlier in October Reddit CEO Steve Huffman told analysts that, ‚Äúsearch represents a focused investment for the company in 2025 due to its utility and how it helps new users find their home on Reddit.‚Äù On the company‚Äôs third-quarter earnings call, he said this was an opportunity to register earnings from the AI feature. ‚ÄúIt helps core users navigate Reddit, answer their questions and it is a monetization opportunity.‚Äù Huffman. In the past 12 months, Reddit has become one of the most visited sites through Google , and this is because the company made changes internally. This was also helped by the fact that Google updated its algorithms to prioritize authentic content from online forums. Hoffman in October also said, ‚ÄúReddit is the sixth most searched word on Google in the US this year and so, those are people literally typing the word Reddit into Google. They know they are going to end up there. They are using in this case, Google to navigate Reddit.‚Äù The company reported that after the adjustments, it has seen an increase in new users who are not logged into accounts on the platform. The expectation is that with Reddit Answers, the number of users who will search for Reddit content on their platform will increase significantly and reduce reliance on Google for traffic. If it comes to suffice, the new users will create accounts that still want to use the feature. ‚ÄúReddit Answers is only available in English for iOS and desktop users for now, but we plan to roll out the feature to Android users as well as in other languages in the future,‚Äù Piantino said.

Proceeds from the offering will primarily fund additional Bitcoin acquisitions and other corporate purposes. Riot plans to calculate the initial conversion price using its common stock‚Äôs U.S. composite volume-weighted average price on the pricing date. The notes and any convertible shares will not be registered under the Securities Act or other securities laws. They cannot publicly trade in the U.S. without proper registration or exemptions. Riot closed Q3 with 10,427 BTC , adding 1,104 BTC while refraining from selling any holdings. This marked an increase from the 844 BTC mined in Q2. Race for Bitcoin Heats Up: How Miners Are Securing Funds Amid Limited Supply and Political Shifts The announcement aligns with a rising trend among Bitcoin miners leveraging convertible bonds to raise capital. According to The Miner Mag , seven publicly traded miners, excluding Riot, raised $5.2 billion via convertible bonds since June, with 70% of the funds secured in the four weeks leading up to December 5. Core Scientific issued $400 million in August, while Marathon Digital raised $1 billion in November. The company used the funds for debt management and Bitcoin purchases. Within a week, Marathon acquired 6,474 BTC, bringing its holdings to 34,797 BTC. Japanese firm Metaplanet followed suit, raising $45 million through share sales to finance Bitcoin acquisitions. This aligns with the growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin, with advocates like MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor leading the charge. On December 9, MicroStrategy announced a $2.1 billion purchase of 21,550 BTC at an average of $98,783 per Bitcoin. Michael Saylor, co-founder and former CEO of MicroStrategy, recently expressed his long-term optimism about Bitcoin. Saylor said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be buying Bitcoin at $1 million a coin.‚Äù Some experts believe the race for Bitcoin‚Äôs finite supply intensifies, especially amid political shifts, including the election of pro-Bitcoin U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.

Speaking to Bloomberg TV, Summers, who oversaw the US national gold reserve under President Bill Clinton, described the concept as impractical and unnecessary. ‚ÄúThe idea that we should have some kind of national Bitcoin reserve is crazy,‚Äù Summers said. ‚ÄúUnlike gold or oil, which have tangible uses and strategic value, Bitcoin is essentially an unproductive inventory.‚Äù Summers argued that the proposal lacked a clear purpose and appeared to appeal to special interests. ‚ÄúThere is no reason to do this other than to please the generous special interests who contributed to the campaign,‚Äù Summers added. The plan has its roots in promises made at a Bitcoin conference in July, when Trump vowed to fire Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler and floated the idea of a Bitcoin reserve. Trump claimed such a move was necessary to counter geopolitical rivals, saying, ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt do it, China and others will.‚Äù Crypto-friendly Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced a bill supporting the initiative, proposing that the U.S. government purchase 1 million Bitcoins over five years, about 5% of the global supply. At current market prices, such a reserve would cost about $100 billion. Proponents argue that the reserve could reduce the national debt and diversify government assets to strengthen the dollar. *This is not investment advice.

(GFO-X), a London-based crypto derivatives trading platform, has secured partnerships with prominent financial institutions including Standard Chartered Plc, Virtu Financial Inc., ABN Amro Clearing, and market maker IMC. The platform, backed by M&G Investments, plans to officially launch in the first quarter of 2025 after multiple delays. Can GFO-X‚Äôs Regulated Platform Redefine Crypto Derivatives for Institutional Investors? The announcement was made on December 9, confirming these financial giants as key collaborators in GFO-X‚Äôs efforts to establish a regulated platform for crypto derivatives trading in the United Kingdom. Source: GFO-X / Linkedin The exchange aims to handle trading in Bitcoin index futures and options, with transactions cleared through LCH SA, a clearinghouse majority-owned by the London Stock Exchange Group. LCH has developed a specialized service, DigitalAssetsClear, to cash-settle GFO-X‚Äôs derivatives trades, ensuring secure and regulated operations. This move follows LCH SA‚Äôs regulatory approval in April 2024 to clear Bitcoin index futures, a decision that came nearly a year after the firm announced plans to extend central clearing services for GFO-X‚Äôs platform. GFO-X revealed that the platform is set to launch officially in the first quarter of 2025, with the aim of offering Bitcoin index futures and options tailored for institutional investors. These products will operate through the DigitalAssetsClear service provided by LCH SA, a London-based clearing services firm. Andy Ross, global head of prime and financing at Standard Chartered, expressed enthusiasm for the initiative, stating, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre delighted to support the launch of GFO-X derivatives and to join LCH SA as a general clearing member to enable our clients to trade and clear.‚Äù The GFO-X derivatives platform has also received backing from M&G Investments and regulatory approval from the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) since 2022. From GFO-X to BlackRock: Financial Titans Double Down on Crypto Amid Market Rally The recent rally in digital asset prices, driven by Donald Trump‚Äôs re-election and his administration‚Äôs pro-crypto stance, has reignited institutional interest in the crypto market. Bitcoin surged over 40% since the election, reaching an all-time high of $103,800 last week. Arnab Sen, CEO of GFO-X, said: ‚ÄúThere are huge tailwinds post the US election. We‚Äôve had multiple firms reach out, many of whom had previously been cautious about entering the space.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs victory has fueled optimism among investors, who anticipate crypto-friendly legislation that could remove regulatory barriers and encourage greater participation from traditional financial institutions. The launch of GFO-X‚Äôs platform is expected further to bolster institutional engagement in the crypto derivatives space. Other financial giants are also increasing their involvement in cryptocurrency. Intesa Sanpaolo SpA recently expanded its digital assets desk to manage spot trades. Standard Chartered has been actively expanding its presence in the cryptocurrency sector. In October, crypto exchange OKX selected Standard Chartered as its crypto custodian. Meanwhile, BlackRock Inc., the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, has accumulated $58 billion in assets through its Bitcoin-backed exchange-traded fund. BlackRock is also advancing efforts to make its money-market digital coin more widely accepted as collateral in crypto derivatives trades. In August, the bank‚Äôs digital arm, Mox Bank, also launched the first spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by a virtual bank.

Brandt, who is recognized for his pessimistic perspectives on XRP, identified the token‚Äôs present chart pattern as a game-changing factor. According to reports, technical indicators show that an unprecedented breakout may be imminent for XRP. The critic identified critical signs, including an elevated trading volume and an ongoing support level, as indicators of an increasing level of investor confidence. Market analysts have expressed their opinion that XRP‚Äôs relative stability amid broader market fluctuations could potentially position it for a substantial rally. It is believed by some that the asset could reach new highs by surpassing resistance levels, thereby further solidifying its status as a significant participant in the crypto ecosystem. The Ripple Effect Beyond technical analysis, Ripple‚Äôs strategic partnerships and expansion into new markets have significantly increased the appeal of XRP. Using the altcoin to enable cross-border transactions, Ripple has been aggressively showcasing its payment solutions. These initiatives have drawn attention from institutional investors to the token‚Äôs use cases. Restoring investor confidence has also been much aided by Ripple‚Äôs most recent court triumph against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

37435698,https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-miner-convertible-note-raises,1733776200,A crypto stock check-in as miner raises continue,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . MicroStrategy has bought more bitcoin, and an analyst team has upped its Coinbase stock price target . But first a look at bitcoin miners, which are increasingly raising capital via convertible note issuances. Bitdeer last month unveiled a $360 million convertible senior notes offering. Then last week, Marathon Digital, Core Scientific and Iris Energy initiated convertible notes offerings ‚Äî amounting to $850 million, $550 million and $400 million, respectively. Seven publicly traded BTC miners and data center companies have raised a combined $5.2 billion via convertible notes since June, according to data compiled by TheMinerMag. About 70% of that came in the last four weeks. That MinerMag stat doesn‚Äôt include the most recent issuance: Riot Platforms on Monday proposed a $500 million convertible notes offering. These moves reflect mining firms capitalizing on growing bullish sentiment around bitcoin among institutional investors , BlocksBridge Consulting founder Nishant Sharma told me. ‚ÄúThis trend is likely to continue, as we‚Äôre in the early stages of a new crypto bull run ,‚Äù he added. Bitcoin‚Äôs price was about $98,000 at 2 pm ET Monday ‚Äî down 3% from 24 hours ago. Bitdeer noted the proceeds of its offering would go toward data center expansion, as well as ASIC-based mining rig development and manufacturing. The firm‚Äôs stock has surged 86% over the past month and more than 27% during last Friday‚Äôs trading session alone, Benchmark‚Äôs Mark Palmer wrote in a Monday research note. Last week‚Äôs rally came after the company boosted its SEALMINER A2 mining rig hashrate projection in 2025 from 18 exahash per second (EH/s) to 35 EH/s. Palmer raised his Bitdeer stock price target from $16 to $29 ‚Äî noting ‚Äúthe company‚Äôs multifaceted business model provides investors with multiple ways to realize upside.‚Äù Marathon and Riot specifically mentioned having their eye on using the capital to buy more BTC. MARA and RIOT share prices are down 3% and down 23%, respectively, over the past month. Sharma said it wouldn‚Äôt surprise him to see Marathon aggressively follow the ‚Äúcompelling precedent‚Äù set by MicroStrategy , noting MARA and competitor CleanSpark, for example, are well-positioned to take ‚Äúdecisive action‚Äù on both mining and ‚Äúhodling.‚Äù Marathon holds 34,959 BTC, while CleanSpark has 9,297 bitcoins. Hut 8 Mining has 9,122 BTC and said it would use some proceeds from its latest at-the-market (ATM) and stock repurchase programs to purchase more bitcoin ‚Äúas a strategic reserve asset .‚Äù As teased at the top, MicroStrategy bought another 21,550 bitcoins (for about $2.1 billion in cash) between Dec. 2 and 8, bringing its total pile to 423,650 BTC.

37435269,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=625031,1733775957,Nvidia shares tumble as China launches antitrust investigations,"Nvidia shares took a hit on Monday, falling 3%, after Chinese regulators announced a formal antitrust investigation into the company. The probe is being led by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), which is scrutinizing Nvidia‚Äôs $6.9 billion acquisition of Israeli tech company Mellanox Technologies back in 2020. The acquisition involved agreements that the Chinese government now claims may have violated its antimonopoly laws. The Chinese regulator‚Äôs statement, translated by CNBC, said it was acting ‚Äúin accordance with the law‚Äù to investigate Nvidia for ‚Äúrestrictive conditions‚Äù linked to the Mellanox deal. The investigation has raised concerns about Nvidia‚Äôs ability to operate in one of its biggest markets, just as the global chip industry faces growing geopolitical challenges. Chip wars heat up between the U.S. and China This whole thing just adds more fuel to the ongoing chip war between the U.S. and China. The Biden administration recently tightened export controls on semiconductors, barring Nvidia and other U.S. chipmakers from selling their most advanced AI chips to Chinese buyers. These restrictions are part of a broader strategy to prevent China from gaining access to technology that could improve its military capabilities. In response to U.S. sanctions, Nvidia created downgraded versions of its AI chips to stay compliant with regulations while still doing business in China. However, these measures have not been enough to ease the tensions. The Chinese investigation into Nvidia could be seen as retaliation for U.S. trade policies, which have repeatedly targeted China‚Äôs tech sector. The U.S. isn‚Äôt backing down either. Earlier this month, the Biden administration announced a new round of curbs aimed at semiconductor toolmakers. These restrictions, combined with past measures, have significantly limited the flow of advanced technology to China. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump, set to take office in January, has promised even harsher trade measures, including a proposed 60% tariff on Chinese goods. China‚Äôs actions against Nvidia follow similar moves targeting other U.S. tech companies. In 2023, China‚Äôs cybersecurity regulator barred Micron Technology‚Äôs chips from being used in critical infrastructure projects, claiming they failed to pass a security review. Micron reported that nearly half of its revenue tied to Chinese clients could be at risk because of the ban. Nvidia‚Äôs global antitrust troubles Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Justice launched its own investigation into Nvidia‚Äôs business practices. Officials looked into allegations that the company made it harder for customers to switch to rival suppliers and imposed penalties on buyers who didn‚Äôt exclusively use Nvidia‚Äôs chips. France also took aim at Nvidia in 2023. The country‚Äôs antitrust agency investigated the company‚Äôs AI chip dominance, with the head of the agency warning that Nvidia could face charges in the future. The European Union is also conducting an early-stage probe into potential anticompetitive practices in the AI hardware market. Nvidia‚Äôs GPUs, which were originally designed for video gaming, have become essential for training artificial intelligence models and running advanced applications. With competitors like Amazon working to create their own chips, the company‚Äôs hold on the market is under pressure. For now, though, Nvidia‚Äôs GPUs are in such high demand that they often sell for tens of thousands of dollars each. The bigger picture The Nvidia investigation is part of a larger economic battle between the U.S. and China. Over the past six years, trade tensions have escalated dramatically. During his first term, Donald Trump initiated a trade war with China, imposing tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods. Now as he prepares to return to office, Trump has vowed to take an even harder stance. China‚Äôs options for direct retaliation are limited because of its massive trade surplus with the U.S., but it has other tools at its disposal. One possibility is selling off its $734 billion in U.S. Treasury holdings. While this would disrupt global financial markets and put upward pressure on U.S. bond yields, it would also hurt China‚Äôs own foreign-exchange reserves. Another option is devaluing the yuan. A cheaper currency would make Chinese exports more competitive, helping to offset the impact of U.S. tariffs. During the 2018-2019 trade war, the yuan lost 11.5% of its value against the dollar, cushioning much of the tariff burden. But further devaluation risks triggering capital outflows and discouraging foreign investment. China has already shown its willingness to take asymmetrical measures. In addition to targeting Nvidia and Micron, Beijing has tightened its grip on rare earth minerals, which are critical for manufacturing high-tech products. Any escalation in the trade war could see China weaponizing its dominance in these materials, creating more chaos in global supply chains.

Allegations of Significant Economic Stimulus,"China has signaled significant economic stimulus plans in 2025, marking a significant shift in its monetary policy stance. The announcement, which underlines the readiness to support the country's slowing economy, shows that the Beijing administration has entered a new period of fiscal strategy. China‚Äôs top policy-making body, the Politburo, said monetary policy would shift to ‚Äúmoderate ease‚Äù in 2025, a term not used since the 2008 global financial crisis. Analysts see that as a clear directive to China‚Äôs central bank and finance ministry to step up efforts to support economic growth. The decision was made due to the poor performance of China‚Äôs stimulus measures, which were introduced in late 2024. Data from the last quarter showed that the initiatives failed to deliver the desired economic boost, prompting Chinese policymakers to reassess. The timing also aligns with broader global economic concerns, with analysts speculating that Beijing‚Äôs proactive approach could be an attempt to cushion the economy from potential geopolitical and financial uncertainties, including U.S. President-elect Trump‚Äôs economic policies. Chinese economic policy expert John Smith commented: ‚ÄúThis is the clearest signal yet that the Chinese leadership is prepared to go further to stabilise the economy. This announcement reflects a significant change of mindset at the highest levels.‚Äù The announcement is expected to have a ripple effect on global markets, particularly in Europe, where China's economic health greatly impacts the performance of the basic resources and luxury goods sectors. Related News: Coinbase Gives Partial Positive News This Time For Altcoin Shaken By Its Delist Decision But there are questions about whether geopolitical tensions will dampen China‚Äôs demand for European luxury goods. ‚ÄúIf Chinese consumers feel more affluent and confident, they will probably return to spending on high-end European brands,‚Äù Smith said. While the announcement is a strong signal, it remains to be seen whether China will deliver a ‚Äúbig bombshell‚Äù moment with large-scale stimulus or take a more measured approach. For now, economists see it as a crucial step in addressing long-standing economic challenges such as sluggish growth, a housing downturn and weakening consumer confidence. *This is not investment advice.

From Dogecoin‚Äôs hilarious beginnings to Shiba Inu‚Äôs rise as the ‚ÄúDogecoin killer,‚Äù these coins have consistently proven that they‚Äôre more than just jokes. They‚Äôre cultural phenomena. But 2024 is upping the stakes in a big way. Meme coins are no longer riding on pure hype‚Äîthey‚Äôre blending utility with community power to offer actual investment opportunities. And leading the charge this week is BTFD Coin , a brand-new contender that‚Äôs breaking records left and right. With its innovative Play-to-Earn (P2E) game , impressive staking rewards, and an electric presale launch that‚Äôs already smashed milestones, BTFD Coin is proving it‚Äôs here to stay. At the same time, OG meme coins like Shiba Inu are keeping their momentum with ecosystem expansions, while the quirky newcomer Comedian Coin is charming its way into investors‚Äô wallets. But why are these coins the best meme coins to buy this week? Let‚Äôs break it down. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Breaking Records and Setting the Bar High If you‚Äôre the type who loves to ‚ÄúBuy The F***ing Dip,‚Äù then BTFD Coin is calling your name. Launched in late November 2024, this meme coin is anything but ordinary. Its presale is breaking records‚ÄîBTFD has already raised over $2.6 million, sold 44 billion tokens, and amassed a passionate community of over 3,900 Bulls (their nickname for holders). With a presale price currently sitting at $0.0001 in Stage 10 and a planned listing price of $0.0006, the numbers speak for themselves. But it‚Äôs not just the presale stats that have everyone buzzing. BTFD Coin is revolutionising meme coins with utility. Its P2E game , Bulls Squad, takes gaming to a new level, offering players an immersive experience while earning real rewards. On top of that, staking is a major draw for BTFD holders, with attractive APYs that let you grow your bag passively while riding the hype wave.

With the token price set to hit $0.0006 at launch, even a modest investment could lead to jaw-dropping returns. If FLOKI could mint millionaires, why not BTFD?

Add in the P2E game and staking rewards, and you‚Äôve got a meme coin with a purpose‚Äîa rarity in today‚Äôs market. The Final Word: Act Before It‚Äôs Too Late Meme coins are all about timing.

The publication used her name and official Fox News graphics to promote a scam involving a non-existent BlackRock token. The Fraudulent Piece Terrett raised the alarm on X, stating: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a fake article circulating using my name and official Fox graphics to promote a scam BlackRock token sale.‚Äù She also cautioned users to remain vigilant against the scam. A screenshot she shared revealed details from the article. The fake report, dated December 5, falsely claimed that BlackRock, the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, had launched a presale for a token named ‚ÄúBlackRock Token (BRT).‚Äù The post described this fictional token as a ‚Äúgroundbreaking‚Äù initiative to integrate blockchain technology into traditional finance. It also urged readers to visit a phony website, ‚ÄúBlackRockToken[.]net,‚Äù to participate in the presale. The site allegedly provided detailed project information, including step-by-step purchase guides, insights into tokenomics and utility, and updates on supposed milestones. The post included promotional claims highlighting the ‚ÄúBlackRock Advantage,‚Äù describing the token as a testament to BlackRock‚Äôs leadership in financial innovation. It claimed that the initiative leverages the firm‚Äôs resources, expertise, and commitment to deliver exceptional value to investors, positioning the project as a blend of traditional finance and blockchain‚Äôs potential. The scam news article attempted to appear legitimate by featuring an AI-generated image resembling Fox News graphics and attributing false writing credits to Eleanor Terrett and FOX Business. Meanwhile, this isn‚Äôt the first time BlackRock has found itself on the wrong end of such an incident. Last year, on November 13, a bogus filing appeared on the Delaware Division of Corporations website, claiming that the asset manager had registered an ‚ÄúiShares XRP Trust.‚Äù However, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas later confirmed with the company that the document was fraudulent. Similar Exploits This incident is part of a broader trend of cryptocurrency-related scams and hacks targeting high-profile platforms and figures. On December 8, the Cardano Foundation‚Äôs X account was hacked to promote a fake token called ‚ÄúADAsol.‚Äù The bad actors falsely claimed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had filed a lawsuit against Cardano and alleged that the foundation would cease support for ADA. Similarly, in September, A Bloomberg report revealed that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman‚Äôs X account was compromised to advertise a fake token named ‚Äú$OPENAI.‚Äù The sham post, filled with errors such as referring to the token as ‚Äú$OPEANAI,‚Äù encouraged users to connect their wallets to a phishing website with a misleading URL, ‚Äútoken-openai[.]com.‚Äù The site promised early access to future OpenAI beta programs, preying on unsuspecting users eager to benefit from the nonexistent cryptocurrency.

37434554,https://crypto.news/?p=14317781,1733775082,Blockchain advocates oppose SEC Crenshaw‚Äôs re-confirmation,"Blockchain community members voiced strong opposition to the re-confirmation of Democratic U.S. SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw as the agency undergoes leadership transition. The Blockchain Association filed a joint letter with the DeFi Education Fund opposing Crenshaw‚Äôs potential extension as a Securities and Exchange Commission leader. ‚ÄúHer actions have undermined Congress‚Äôs clear mandate to establish sound regulatory policies for crypto,‚Äù the Blockchain Association tweeted on Dec. 9 ahead of a Senate vote on the SEC commissioner. Crenshaw was unanimously voted as an SEC commissioner in 2020, completing the Democratic SEC leadership alongside chair Gary Gensler and fellow commissioner Jaime Liz√°rraga. You might also like: Wyoming seeks developers for state-backed stablecoin Under Gensler, Crenshaw regularly sided with anti-crypto policies and dissented against pro-blockchain decisions. Crenshaw famously voted against approving spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded funds, the fastest-growing asset class on Wall Street, with over $109 billion in assets within a year. This divergence in perspective on regulatory matters integral to crypto in the U.S. is even more troubling, given the emerging consensus from the incoming Congress and administration. She was out of step with the prior Congress and will be even more so with the 119th. And, unlike many policymakers who‚Äôve grown to understand crypto‚Äôs potential through education and engagement, Commissioner Crenshaw has shown little-to-no interest in evolving her stance or fostering constructive dialogue with our growing industry. Blockchain Association Her history at the SEC would also pit her against potential incoming chair Paul Atkins, Trump‚Äôs preferred pick. Akins has been a long-time crypto supporter and called for common sense regulation of digital assets. The Senate still has to confirm Trump‚Äôs nomination of Atkins, but many industry insiders consider him the next SEC chair. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said the crypto community was alert to the Senate Banking Committee‚Äôs vote on Crenshaw‚Äôs SEC tenure. The outcome could affect future industry support for politicians, Armstrong noted. Crenshaw‚Äôs re-confirmation Senate vote is scheduled for Dec. 18. If re-confirmed, she could serve till 2029 and work at the SEC all through Donald Trump‚Äôs administration. Caroline Crenshaw was a failure as an SEC Commissioner and should be voted out. She tried to block the Bitcoin ETFs, and was worse than Gensler on some issues (which I didn't think was possible).

This achievement by the market leader has uplifted the whole crypto ecosystem, affecting major coins like Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT). However, this bullish wave is more beneficial for emerging gems like DTX Exchange. While projects like Cardano and Polkadot have provided substantial gains for investors, their communities are now shifting towards DTX Exchange because of its growth potential. DTX Exchange is under the spotlight with ground-breaking performance in its token presale. Cardano (ADA) Price Forecast: ADA Outperforms Major Altcoins The Cardano (ADA) token has closed in green in 17 of the last 20 trading days, outperforming major blockchains like BTC and SOL while hitting significant milestones. The Cardano (ADA) rally gained momentum primarily due to founder Charles Hoskinson‚Äôs active role in shaping U.S. cryptocurrency policy. Cardano (ADA) surged from $0.32 to over $1.15 in November, delivering a 216% gain. However, this week, Cardano (ADA) corrected nearly 15%, dipping to a low of $1.11. Now, ADA is recovering from $1.10 and testing the $1.15 level again. Cardano (ADA)‚Äôs price stayed strong above $1.15 on Thursday; the failure of sellers taking over hints at strength in the price. Recent on-chain inflows and speculation about Gary Gensler‚Äôs exit suggest the Cardano (ADA) rally could push toward $1.50 in the coming days. Polkadot (DOT) At Multi-year Resistance Polkadot (DOT) has shown strong momentum since the breakout in early November. Polkadot has climbed 156% in the past 30 days. Currently, Polkadot is trading near the multi-year breakout zone of $112. While the short-term momentum in Polkadot may pause for correction or sideways momentum, long-term performance remains positive, with a 77% increase compared to the same time last year. As per the data, Polkadot recently achieved an important milestone of carrying out 60 million monthly transactions as DOT went into a bullish mode. This increase in transaction volume raises the anticipation of DOT hitting $15 in the coming times. The recent surge of transactions expresses the bullish inclination for the crypto token, which signals that Polkadot has a bright future. DTX Exchange (DTX): The Best Future Bet? DTX Exchange is a small-cap gem poised to dominate the cryptocurrency space. This project is more than just another cryptocurrency; its unique hybrid infrastructure aims to transform the trillion-dollar crypto industry. The best part of DTX Exchange is that it combines the best of CEX and DEX in its hybrid platform, addressing challenges like governance issues and global accessibility, which affect trading liquidity. Further, with hybrid protocol, DTX allows the investment in various assets without changing the platform. Another advantage for DTX Exchange users is increased profit potential with exceptional leverage, which can quickly take the portfolio to new heights. Traders can use DTX‚Äôs remarkable features without any hectic KYC procedures, as it is a KYC-free platform. DTX Exchange (DTX) is making waves as the speculation of its mainnet launch has increased. With its strong growth momentum, DTX stands out as a top choice for those seeking significant gains in 2025, making it a clear winner this bullish season. In the sixth stage of the presale, investors can purchase DTX tokens at the price of $0.12.

Now, the Senate Banking Committee has scheduled a hearing on Wednesday to consider that nomination.  Several digital assets organizations have deployed in an effort to block her approval.

The DeFi Education Fund similarly contended that Crenshaw's actions are ""at odds with this charge.""  And Ji Kim, the chief legal and policy council for the Crypto Council for Innovation, posted on X, ""Commissioner Crenshaw has unfortunately not demonstrated the objective judgment required of agency leaders.""  Scott, for his part, asked President Joe Biden to withdraw his outstanding nominations after the election, reiterating this request last Friday.

The platform focuses on developing decentralised AI models that can operate transparently and collaboratively. By combining the strengths of AI and blockchain, ASIA aims to create a global network of AI agents that can solve complex problems across industries, from healthcare to finance. The project‚Äôs emphasis on ethical AI development and decentralisation ensures that it aligns with the values of transparency and fairness. As blockchain and AI converge, ASIA is well-positioned to lead this transformative trend. Presale and Growth Potential Currently in Presale Phase 12, Qubetics offers an unparalleled investment opportunity. The $TICS token is priced at $0.031, with over $5.3 million raised, 8000+ holders, and 300 million tokens sold. Weekly presale phases bring a 10% price hike, culminating in a 20% increase in the final stage. The post-presale target price of $0.25 offers an impressive 703.5% ROI potential, with analysts predicting that $TICS could reach $10 to $15 after the mainnetlaunch. Qubetics is also developing solutions for near-instant cross-border payments and seamless asset management, further cementing its position as a blockchain game-changer. Conclusion: Diversify with High-Growth Cryptocurrencies The cryptocurrency market offers many opportunities for investors willing to embrace innovation. Ethereum, VeChain, AAVE, Stacks, Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance, and Qubetics each bring unique strengths, addressing different aspects of blockchain technology and its applications. Among these, Qubetics stands out for its comprehensive ecosystem and transformative approach to tokenised assets and cross-border payments. With top crypto presale in its final stages, the opportunity to acquire $TICS tokens at a low entry price is dwindling.

Teng touched on a wide range of topics, including Binance's compliance efforts, global market strategies, and the state of crypto adoption in regions like the Middle East. The famous CEO noted that it was important for Donald Trump to select crypto-friendly figures for key roles such as SEC Chairman and crypto chief. Teng described 2024 as a turning point, pointing to milestones such as the price increase of Bitcoin, approval of ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the increasing involvement of institutions such as BlackRock. On the potential impact of Trump‚Äôs regulatory stance, Teng commented: ‚ÄúWe now have a crypto-friendly president in America‚Ä¶ This represents the most innovative technology for the future, and countries that adopt it will do very well.‚Äù However, he added that Binance continues to focus on compliance and global operations rather than engaging in political lobbying to influence regulatory decisions in the US.

He praised the region‚Äôs regulatory foresight, particularly Abu Dhabi‚Äôs early adoption of a crypto framework in 2018, positioning it as a global hub for blockchain and digital assets.

User expectations are for ME airdrops to be worth a few hundred dollars. However, some long-term NFT holders and traders were surprised to have a relatively small allocation. The expectations are that not all activities will boost the ME airdrop, but there may be a higher allocation for the holders of the Magic Eden Diamond Collection. Is Binance preparing for a ME listing? The actual ME token has not yet been created, and Magic Eden has not announced an official smart contract. Despite this, on-chain researchers are pointing to speculations of Binance preparing for deposits. Binance itself has not announced its intentions to list ME. Only OKX mentioned its plans to immediately list the asset, while KuCoin even allows pre-market price discovery. A wallet tagged as ‚ÄòBinance Deposit‚Äô by Arkham Intelligence was tracked for signs of onboarding ME. This wallet was the creator and owner of another token account , tagged as ‚ÄòMagic Eden‚Äô. This token account leads to a smart contract with an ME and a ‚ÄòMagic Eden‚Äô tag, but not yet a verified status. The ME contract is linked to other small-scale wallets as owners, and the distribution in percentage terms is not similar to the previously announced ME tokenomics. The only available ME token at the moment was minted in a single transaction 19 days ago in late November, with most of the tokens held back ahead of the expected distribution. For now, the best approach is to keep track of the verified token addresses, while avoiding speculative assets. While potentially connected to Binance, the current ME token transactions are not yet reliable. The newly launched ME asset is also showing low-grade trading activity, raising more doubts about whether it is the real token. When the official contract is announced, Magic Eden will also announce the first listings. However, data from Birdeye shows addresses are trying to send SOL liquidity even before the formation of a trading pair. The other disparity is that ME is intended to become a multi-chain token, with launches on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon. The December 10 airdrop will distribute 12.5% of the total supply. Over time, the community will receive 50.2% of the total token supply. The goal of ME is to serve as a governance token, making decisions on the NFT market.

The company intends to use the net proceeds primarily to acquire Bitcoin for its corporate treasury and for general corporate purposes. This move follows a similar strategy previously adopted by companies like MicroStrategy Inc. and Marathon Digital Holdings Inc., which have also invested in Bitcoin for their corporate treasuries. The announcement led to a 6.5% drop in Riot Platforms' shares during premarket trading. This is an AI-generated article powered by DeepNewz, curated by The Defiant.

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address ‚Äì C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEMAGA.

Key events such as the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in January , the long-awaited Halving in April, and the volatility surrounding the Presidential election cycle have fueled a mega bull market. This rally has propelled BTC/USD to a record high of $103,679 , cementing Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance in the financial landscape. #Bitcoin Cycles Timeline.

Look how‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/0305klH4WQ ‚Äî Brett (@brett_eth) December 7, 2024 However, for smart money investors, none of this is a surprise, as the ongoing bull run continues to add weight to the long-standing theory around predictable Bitcoin price cycles. Indeed, some Bitcoin maxi figures like Michael Saylor still believe Bitcoin is undervalued at current BTC USD price levels, Crypto CEO Claims Bitcoin Price is Set For Major Correction to Down to $65,000 While many in the crypto space remain bullish with price predictions reaching as high as $1 million , such as those from JAN3 CEO Samson Mow, not everyone shares this optimism. However, not all in the crypto industry share this optimistic view, with some prominent figures now bearish about the short-term potential of Bitcoin price action. Ilya Volkov , the CEO of Switzerland-based DeFi platform YouHodler, expects a major BTC USD price correction in 2025, with the crypto executive currently targeting the $60,000-$65,000 range. In an explanation, Volkov highlighted that despite the short-term risk of a price correction for BTC, the current trend towards cryptocurrency represents the birth of a major change in how the global financial ecosystem operates. ‚ÄúHowever, broader financial instability and currency devaluations may catalyze the emergence of large-scale debt markets utilizing cryptocurrencies, including loans and bonds,‚Äù Volkov suggested. ‚ÄúThis development could mark a turning point in the strategic adoption of blockchain technology, further integrating it into the global financial system.‚Äù This could suggest a high degree of upside for projects focused on tokenizing financial assets in the RWA cryptocurrency sector. BTC USD Skyrocket Is Dependent on US Equities: Is Bitcoin Just Another Tech Stock Now? However, Volkov isn‚Äôt alone in this though process, as another analyst at YouHolder, Chief of Markets Ruslan Lienkha backs this view. In discussing the speculative peak of Bitcoin this run, Lienkha spotlighted that BTC USD recently tested the key psychological level of $100,000 and surged above $104,000 , with a potential long-term speculative price target between $110,000 and $150,000. Yet, Lienkha also argued that any major shift-up in BTC USD price exploration is likely to be tied to the fate of US equities, with Leinkha speculating that such a move would have to see market capital drawn away from traditional stocks. ‚ÄúHowever, sustaining prices below $100,000 would likely require significant market shifts, such as increased pessimism in equity markets, which is an improbable scenario,‚Äù Lienkha warned. ‚ÄúInstead, global equity markets are experiencing a robust Christmas rally, with new all-time highs recorded in the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Germany‚Äôs DAX index.‚Äù Lienkha went on to explain that any downturn in equities could spook institutional Bitcoin investors. ‚ÄúThe ongoing equity rally is fuelled mainly by strong liquidity flows, which continue to support market valuations. We anticipate this upward momentum to persist through December, at least until the expiration of futures and options contracts on major U.S. exchanges,‚Äù added Lienkha. ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äôs price movements, meanwhile, exhibit the strongest historical correlation with U.S. stock indices, suggesting that any downturn in equities could trigger a simultaneous correction in Bitcoin.

37432933,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98594,1733772019,Amazon Shareholders Tell Company To Invest At Least 5% Of Its Assets In Bitcoin To Beat Inflation,"A group of Amazon shareholders is requesting the American multinational technology company to consider allocating a minimum of 5% of its assets to Bitcoin (BTC) to protect against inflation and boost shareholder value. The proposal was submitted by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a conservative think tank. The decision on whether to adopt Bitcoin comes at a pivotal moment as BTC adoption is becoming institutionalized and could be just months away from becoming a US national reserve asset . Amazon Shareholders Eye Bitcoin Allocation What if Amazon started buying up Bitcoin? That‚Äôs the big idea Amazon shareholders are proposing right now. The proposal, shared by Tim Kotzman, recommends adding the apex crypto to Amazon‚Äôs treasury as a hedge against inflation and asset diversification strategy. In particular, it calls for the Silicon Valley aristocracy to invest at least 5% of the company‚Äôs mammoth $585 billion total assets in BTC. https://twitter.com/TimKotzman/status/1865832907597807992 ‚ÄúThough Bitcoin is currently a volatile asset ‚Äî as Amazon stock has been at times throughout its history ‚Äî corporations have a responsibility to maximize shareholder value over the long-term as well as the short-term. Diversifying the balance sheet by including some bitcoin solves this problem without taking on too much volatility,‚Äù the proposal reads. Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs largest crypto by market cap, has jumped over 130% this year, crossing the long-promised $100,000 milestone in a move that has outshined every major asset, including gold, corporate bonds, and the S&P 500. The proposal urges Amazon‚Äôs board to assess whether Bitcoin treasury allocation serves shareholders‚Äô long-term interests. The NCPPR‚Äôs proposal is part of a wider institutional push toward Bitcoin adoption. In October, the think tank sent a similar proposal to Microsoft urging Bitcoin investment consideration. However, Microsoft‚Äôs board has advised shareholders to vote against their proposal, indicating that the company‚Äôs management had already carefully considered ‚Äúa wide range of investable assets,‚Äù including BTC. Notably, Amazon‚Äôs board of directors has to decide whether to include the proposal in the company‚Äôs proxy statement at the annual shareholders meeting in April 2025. Accept Bitcoin Payments? The proposal to add Bitcoin to Amazon‚Äôs treasury has also prompted suggestions regarding the top crypto‚Äôs practical use cases. The founder and former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has suggested that Amazon could just start accepting BTC as a payment option. https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1865854419331600533 Some commentators said Bitcoin is not a good means of payment because it takes too long to confirm transactions. However, as Zhao highlighted, the alpha crypto is reliable. Despite the delays, Bitcoin still works without any intermediaries, marking a huge advancement over traditional finance systems.

Analysts suggest Shibarium‚Äôs progress could be one of the factors sparking a SHIB rally. Shibarium Keeps Progressing Shiba Inu‚Äôs layer-2 scaling solution officially launched in August last year. Since then, it has achieved numerous milestones. As CryptoPotato reported in November, the total number of transactions processed on the protocol has surpassed 500 million. According to the latest data, the number of wallet addresses also reached a psychological level, crossing 2 million. Total blocks are on the way of tapping an impressive peak , too , currently standing at approximately 8.3 million. Shibarium‚Äôs ultimate goal is to foster the development of the Shiba Inu ecosystem by improving speed, reducing transaction costs, and enhancing scalability. Over the past several months, the network underwent several upgrades. In April, the team launched a new user interface (UI) update, describing it as ‚Äúfaster, smoother, and more accessible than ever.‚Äù The development improved compatibility with popular self-custody wallets such as MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Trust Wallet, and more. Shortly after, the team introduced an update through a hard fork to empower the community of developers and innovators and implement quicker block processing times. Shibarium also adopted a burning mechanism. While the effort differs from the original program, its goal is the same: to reduce the tremendous circulating supply of Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens, potentially making them more valuable via scarcity. SHIB Price Condition Some analysts believe Shibarium‚Äôs advancement could trigger a rally for the popular meme coin. SHIB has charted substantial gains in the past month but is down around 7% in the past 24 hours. Its underperformance coincides with a broader correction of the entire digital asset market. SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below $100K, while ETH plunged to $3,800. Other well-known cryptocurrencies recording losses today (December 9) include Cardano (ADA), Binance Coin (BNB), Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), and many more.

Here‚Äôs Why Qubetics Is the Best Crypto to Buy in December 2024 for Incredible Returns,"The crypto world has been buzzing, and Cardano (ADA) has been one of the major players leading the charge. Over the past few years, Cardano has carved a name for itself as a blockchain built on innovation, sustainability, and a laser-sharp focus on scalability. Its rise has been nothing short of impressive, making millionaires out of early adopters. But if you‚Äôre one of those folks who sat on the sidelines, watching ADA‚Äôs meteoric growth, you might be wondering if you missed your shot. Here‚Äôs the good news: you‚Äôre not out of the game. While Cardano continues to shine, a new star is rising‚ÄîQubetics ($TICS). This project isn‚Äôt just another crypto; it‚Äôs a revolutionary Web3 aggregator poised to deliver massive gains. If you‚Äôve been searching for the best crypto to buy in December 2024 , your search ends here. Let‚Äôs break down why Qubetics could be your ticket to the financial freedom you‚Äôve been chasing. Qubetics ($TICS): The Best Crypto to Buy in December 2024 for Real-World Solutions and Big Gains If Cardano made you feel like you missed out, Qubetics is here to prove it‚Äôs never too late to join the crypto party. This isn‚Äôt just about fancy blockchain tech or hyped-up promises. Qubetics is solving real-world problems with asset tokenization, opening doors for businesses, professionals, and individuals alike. Imagine you‚Äôre a small business owner trying to access quick liquidity but tired of jumping through hoops for a bank loan. With Qubetics, you can tokenize your inventory and turn it into digital assets, instantly tradable on the blockchain. It‚Äôs fast, secure, and leaves the old-school financial system in the dust. Or maybe you‚Äôre a real estate investor looking to tokenize property equity. Suddenly, you‚Äôre tapping into global markets without the hassle of traditional red tape. For freelancers and creatives, it‚Äôs even better. Think about an artist in Atlanta tokenizing their work and selling it directly to collectors in Paris or Tokyo. No middlemen, no commissions‚Äîjust pure profit. That‚Äôs the kind of game-changing potential Qubetics offers. Here‚Äôs the kicker: Qubetics is still in presale, which means you‚Äôre getting in at ground zero. As of December 2024, $TICS is priced at just $0.0311 in Phase 12. Over $5.3 million has already been raised, with 330 million tokens sold and more than 8,000 holders on board. The price jumps by 10% every week, so the clock is ticking. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 post-presale, delivering a jaw-dropping ROI of 900%. Qubetics isn‚Äôt just the best crypto to buy in December 2024; it‚Äôs a project redefining how we interact with assets, money, and value in a digital-first world. Cardano (ADA): A Blockchain Trailblazer That Continues to Impress Let‚Äôs not kid ourselves‚ÄîCardano has earned its spot as a blockchain heavyweight. Founded by Ethereum co-creator Charles Hoskinson, Cardano‚Äôs unique, research-driven approach has made it one of the most technically advanced blockchains out there. Its focus on sustainability and scalability has attracted developers and investors alike, making ADA one of the most trusted names in the crypto space. In 2024, Cardano has been firing on all cylinders. With the implementation of its Hydra scaling solution, the network can now handle millions of transactions per second, paving the way for massive adoption. From DeFi platforms to NFTs, Cardano‚Äôs ecosystem continues to expand, drawing in users from all corners of the crypto world. ADA‚Äôs price action has been solid too. Currently trading at around $0.54, analysts predict it could climb to $0.75 or even $1 by mid-2025. That‚Äôs a respectable growth trajectory, especially for an established project with a strong community backing it. Cardano‚Äôs strength lies in its stability and long-term vision. It‚Äôs a great choice for anyone looking to invest in a proven blockchain that‚Äôs here for the long haul. But for those seeking the kind of explosive growth that early Cardano investors enjoyed, Qubetics might just be the opportunity you‚Äôve been waiting for. Why Both Qubetics and Cardano Deserve a Spot in Your Portfolio Here‚Äôs the thing: crypto isn‚Äôt about putting all your eggs in one basket. It‚Äôs about diversifying and making smart bets. Cardano and Qubetics aren‚Äôt competitors; they‚Äôre complementary opportunities that cater to different investment goals. Cardano is the seasoned veteran, offering stability and a well-established ecosystem. It‚Äôs a solid play for investors who value steady growth and proven technology. Meanwhile, Qubetics is the fresh-faced disruptor with sky-high potential. Its focus on real-world applications and asset tokenization makes it a unique addition to any portfolio, especially for those looking to catch the next big wave in crypto. Missed out on Cardano‚Äôs early days? No worries‚ÄîQubetics offers a second chance to be part of a game-changing project from the start. And with the presale still ongoing, there‚Äôs no better time to jump in. Crypto doesn‚Äôt hand out second chances often, but when it does, smart investors know to grab them with both hands. Cardano‚Äôs rise has been incredible, and it‚Äôs still a strong choice for long-term investors. But if you‚Äôre looking for the best crypto to buy in December 2024 with the potential for massive gains, Qubetics ($TICS) is the way to go. With its presale in Phase 12 and tokens priced at just $0.0311, the window of opportunity is closing fast. Prices are set to jump by 10% next week, and once the presale ends, $TICS could skyrocket to $0.25, delivering an ROI of 900%. So, what‚Äôs the move? Don‚Äôt sit on the sidelines, watching others cash in. Head over to Qubetics, secure your $TICS tokens, and position yourself for the financial freedom you‚Äôve been dreaming of. The future‚Äôs calling‚Äîit‚Äôs time to answer.

Saylor also revealed he will buy the crypto asset at the rate of a billion dollars a day. Michael Saylor compares Bitcoin to Manhattan real estate Michael Saylor compared his approach to Bitcoin with the Manhattan real estate market, which was considered ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù in the 1930s but still considered expensive in the 1830s. Saylor explained that 100 years from now, people will still buy Manhattan real estate at more expensive prices than today‚Äôs market rates. ‚ÄúManhattan real estate is really expensive in 1930. It‚Äôs a lot more expensive than 1830. Well, you know, 100 years later we‚Äôll still be buying it, and we will be paying a lot more. The only issue is can you hold it for that time period because people are gonna wanna buy it.‚Äù Michael Saylor During the interview, Dave Portnoy said he thinks Bitcoin is too big to fail because too many people with a lot of money are involved in the asset. He also asked Saylor if owning Bitcoin is an economic or moral decision. Saylor explained that owning Bitcoin is both an economic and a moral decision because it gives holders control over their funds. Saylor also explained Bitcoin to Dave Portnoy in sports terms and said Satoshi Nakamoto created the Bitcoin game for everyone to win. Michael Saylor thinks Bitcoin is the world‚Äôs reserve capital network Michael Saylor is one of the most vocal Bitcoin enthusiasts in the crypto industry. He has appeared on numerous podcasts and mainstream media to talk about his aggressive Bitcoin approach and his future prediction on Bitcoin‚Äôs underlying value. $BTC is ‚Äúgoing to appreciate against the dollar forever,‚Äù MicroStrategy executive chairman @saylor says, adding: ‚ÄúI expect that it‚Äôll be the most valuable thing in the world 100 years from now.‚Äù pic.twitter.com/15RaoqV82A ‚Äî Yahoo Finance (@YahooFinance) December 5, 2024 Saylor recently appeared in an interview and explained how Bitcoin has emerged as the world‚Äôs reserve capital network for long-term investors in various parts of the world, including Africa. Saylor said in the interview that people have realized that Bitcoin is better than other popular investment vehicles, such as real estate and the stock market. During the interview, Saylor mentioned that the asset‚Äôs volatility will decrease as it grows and matures. He also highlighted that extreme drawdowns witnessed in the past will decrease significantly moving forward. According to Bitcoin Treasuries, Microstrategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder. The software company made its most recent purchase on December 8th, worth $2.1 billion, which saw the company add 21,550 Bitcoin to its holdings, bringing its total Bitcoin tally to 423,650 Bitcoin, worth $41.4 billion at current market rates.

According to a new announcement, top crypto exchange Binance is supporting Movement ( MOVE ) through its airdrop portal. After the airdrop, MOVE will be available to trade in the MOVE/BTC, MOVE/USDT, MOVE/BNB, MOVE/FDUSD and MOVE/TRY trading pairs. Binance is attaching a seed tag to MOVE, which the exchange applies to lower-liquidity projects that may exhibit higher volatility compared to other listed tokens. Binance requires users who own assets with seed tags to pass quizzes every 90 days to ensure they‚Äôre aware of the risks before trading the tokens. Korean crypto exchange Upbit has also announced trading support for MOVE. Hours after launch, MOVE is trading for $0.77 at time of writing, up 13.8% since going live. With a market cap of $1.7 billion, MOVE is the 86th largest crypto project. The project‚Äôs FDV, the current token price times the total supply, is at $7,708,019,888. Earlier this year, the project caught the attention of venture capitalist Chris Burniske, who called Movement an ecosystem that could be the one to watch in the near future. Move is a programming language originally built by a consortium backed by tech giant Meta for the now-defunct Diem project. It was then used to develop layer-1 blockchains Sui ( SUI ) and Aptos ( APT ). Said Burniske, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs worth paying attention to ‚Äì even though it‚Äôs very small at this point ‚Äì the Move ecosystem so things like Movement, Aptos, Sui‚Ä¶ People are not really talking about that ecosystem right now in a way that I find interesting, because I always like to go where people aren‚Äôt talking about something much.

37434704,https://invezz.com/?p=2380040,1733771124,Here‚Äôs why SushiSwap (SUSHI) token soared to a yearly high,"SushiSwap (SUSHI) token recently reached a yearly high of $2.64, capturing significant attention in the crypto market before undergoing a slight correction to $2.26 at press time, credited to the profit-taking behaviour of investors. Market participants, however, believe the current SUSHI price pullback can‚Äôt diminish the prior momentum attributed to the platform‚Äôs bold moves aimed at securing its financial stability and innovating its offerings. Two key catalysts that fueled the price pump are the announcement of a Treasury Diversification Proposal and the unveiling of Sushi‚Äôs ambitious 2025 roadmap. SushiSwap‚Äôs Treasury Diversification Proposal The Treasury Diversification Proposal , spearheaded by SushiSwap CEO Jared Grey, has created a buzz in the DeFi community. Aiming to fortify the platform‚Äôs financial foundation, the plan involves liquidating a significant portion of its native SUSHI tokens. The proceeds will be reallocated to a diversified asset mix, including stablecoins like USDC and USDT, ‚Äúblue-chip‚Äù cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, and high-potential DeFi tokens. By adopting a dollar-cost averaging strategy to execute this plan, SushiSwap aims to mitigate volatility while enhancing liquidity and generating passive income. This shift, pending governance approval, represents a transformative step toward ensuring the platform‚Äôs long-term sustainability, instilling investor confidence and driving the token‚Äôs value to new heights. Sushi‚Äôs visionary 2025 plans Under the leadership of Jared Grey, SushiSwap has unveiled an ambitious 2025 roadmap with a slate of innovative developments designed to enhance its ecosystem and address longstanding challenges in DeFi. SushiSwap plans to launch several groundbreaking products aimed at improving user experience and driving adoption. One of the most anticipated products is Wara, a trading platform specifically designed for the Solana blockchain. By leveraging Solana‚Äôs high-speed and low-cost infrastructure, Wara aims to offer seamless trading experiences, appealing to both retail and institutional users. Complementing this is Susa, an on-chain perpetual decentralized exchange (DEX) built with a robust order book structure, catering to advanced traders seeking greater control and precision. The roadmap also includes Kubo, a platform utilizing delta-neutral strategies to minimize risk exposure while maximizing liquidity. This approach not only supports stable returns but also facilitates the creation of new markets, broadening SushiSwap‚Äôs ecosystem. Another innovative addition is Blade, an automated market maker (AMM) that addresses latency-related losses, providing a more efficient trading experience and reducing slippage for users. Enhancements to SushiSwap‚Äôs aggregator stack are also in the works, ensuring users access the best pricing across multiple networks. Additionally, Jared Grey has hinted at a major acquisition that will integrate innovative DeFi primitives into SushiSwap‚Äôs AMM and perpetual trading verticals. This move is expected to significantly expand the platform‚Äôs capabilities, strengthening its position in a competitive DeFi market. Moreover, SushiSwap has partnered with GoPlus Security to enhance user safety by identifying fraudulent tokens and mitigating risks in the Web3 environment. This proactive approach to security underscores the platform‚Äôs commitment to user protection and trust, further boosting its reputation among investors and developers. Together, these initiatives paint a picture of a platform focused on long-term growth and innovation, providing the market with renewed confidence in SushiSwap‚Äôs potential. The roadmap demonstrates not just a vision for expansion but also a strategy for addressing key challenges in the decentralized finance space, fueling optimism among stakeholders.

37434703,https://invezz.com/?p=2380044,1733770935,"SOS, PEPE, Floki buck market trend as Bitcoin rally cools amid profit-taking","After securing a record weekly close of over $100,000 on Sunday, bears took control and pushed Bitcoin price below the six-figure mark, leading to a volatile start of the week. Most of the top altcoins lost the gains accrued over the past weeks, with SOS, PEPE and FLOKI leading the day‚Äôs gains. The overall cryptocurrency market capitalisation slid below $3.8 trillion to hit a daily low of and was hovering over $3.7 trillion at publication time. Effects of Bitcoin‚Äôs lacklustre performance were felt across the altcoin market, with the total altcoin market cap dropping approximately 2.76% in the past 24 hours as most of the top 99 cryptocurrencies struggled to stay profitable. Interestingly, Bitcoin‚Äôs market dominance continued to recede towards the low 50s alongside the Altcoin Season Index, which had dropped to 77 from the 82 seen the previous day. Market pundits pointed to profit-taking across both Bitcoin and altcoin markets as the most plausible reason for the post-election rally to cool off. Will Bitcoin recover? Experts and traders agree that Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term prospects look solid as the industry anticipates a pro-crypto government in the United States to take charge under the leadership of President-elect Donald Trump, and demand from institutional players and corporations continues to rise. At the moment, significant profit-taking from long-term holders is outweighing the buying pressure generated by corporate Bitcoin purchases and ‚Äã‚Äãspot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds inflows, according to CryptoQuant contributor Maartuun. In a recent post, Maartuun pointed out that since Nov. 8, long-term BTC holders holding the flagship for at least 155 days have offloaded 827,783 BTC. On the other hand, Bitcoin buying from MicroStrategy and inflows into Bitcoin ETFs amounted to just 30% of what was sold. Currently, heavy retail demand fueled by BTC‚Äôs recent rally past $100k is helping to counterbalance the strong sell pressure from long-term holders, with retail interest reaching ‚Äúyearly highs,‚Äù according to CryptoQuant‚Äôs retail demand 30-day change chart. Another potential factor behind the market slowdown could be traders awaiting the US Federal Reserve‚Äôs upcoming rate cut decision on Dec. 18, which historically tends to influence Bitcoin prices by increasing liquidity and reducing the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like cryptocurrencies. Previously, rate cuts have translated into substantial rallies for the flagship crypto, and another rate could be the catalyst Bitcoin needs for the next leg up. As of December 9, the CME FedWatch tool puts the probability of a 0.25% December rate cut at 85.5%. When writing, Bitcoin was down 1.7% in the past 24 hours, priced at $98,273. According to several analysts on X, the price needs to hold above the $98,000 support level for the momentum to sustain, or further corrections may follow. Meanwhile, the leading altcoins for the day were: Solana Swap Solana Swap (SOS) soared 26.6% in the past 24 hours, exchanging hands at $4.02 at the time of writing. The recent gains extended its weekly gains to 58.41% while bringing its market cap to over $2.4 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap SOS rallied amid hype surrounding the upcoming launch of the official version of Solana Swap. The surge outpaced the broader crypto market, which has suffered a 4.6% drop as Bitcoin‚Äôs price continues to trade sideways over the past four days, failing to hold above the $100,000 level. According to its white paper, Solana Swap is a decentralised intelligent routing exchange that leverages its integration with Google DeepMind‚Äôs open-source model and the high throughput of the Solana blockchain to offer users greater trading efficiency, enhanced security, and lower trading costs compared to traditional exchanges. Pepe Over the past day, Pepe (PEPE) was up 5.3%, trading at $0.000028 at the time of writing, extending its year-to-date gains to almost 2,000%. The Ethereum-based meme coin hit a 3-year intra-day high of $0.0000271 on Dec. 9, along with its market cap surging past $11 billion for the first time. Source: CoinMarketCap PEPE‚Äôs recent rally followed its feature on the American news channel Fox News, which highlighted the meme coin as a profitable investment alongside the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies typically tend to rally following a major announcement or development. Another potential catalyst for the PEPE rally is its listing on top-tier exchanges, Coinbase and Robinhood, which attracted significant interest from retail traders driven by FOMO and eager to capitalise on the meme coin following its impressive yearly gains. Floki Floki (FLOKI) rose 3.4% over the past day, reaching an intraday high of $0.00027 and bringing its market cap to over $2.5 billion at the time of publication. The meme coin‚Äôs yearly gains stood at over 530%, which has drawn a lot of new investors to buy the second-largest meme coin in the market. Source: CoinMarketCap Additionally, the meme coin recently secured listings on two of Canada‚Äôs largest regulated crypto exchanges, Coinsquare and Bitbuy. The announcement of these listings on such prominent platforms likely renewed interest among traders, driving a rise in the meme coin‚Äôs price.

The $ME token's token generation event (TGE) is set to occur tomorrow, but currently, the airdrop cannot be claimed, indicating that only project insiders or related parties may have access to the tokens at this time.

37432382,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=659449,1733770842,PEPE Whales Increased Their Holdings By $1.4 Billion Yesterday ‚Äì Details,"PEPE has made headlines again, reaching a new all-time high of $0.000027 just a few hours ago. This milestone comes amid heightened market volatility, with the token showing massive gains as it outpaces many other assets in the crypto space. PEPE‚Äôs explosive price action attracts significant attention as retail and institutional investors flock to capitalize on the momentum. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees Quiet Breakout As Data Signals Rally Continuation Recent metrics from IntoTheBlock reveal a striking trend: whales increased their PEPE holdings by a staggering $1.4 billion yesterday. This sharp accumulation by large holders suggests that smart money positions itself for an extended rally, signaling confidence in the token‚Äôs potential for further gains. As PEPE continues to soar, the market is closely monitoring its ability to maintain momentum in the face of growing interest and volatility. The influx of whale activity often signals a pivotal shift in market dynamics, which could begin a new phase for the meme coin. Smart Money Signals Upside Pepe (PEPE) has been on a remarkable ascent, consistently setting new all-time highs and showing no signs of slowing down. The meme coin has captured the market‚Äôs attention with its recent surge, positioning itself as one of the top-performing assets in the crypto space. After reaching $0.000027, PEPE appears ready to extend its rally, with on-chain activity supporting the bullish narrative. Data from IntoTheBlock, shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, highlights a key development driving PEPE‚Äôs momentum: whales increased their holdings by an astounding $1.4 billion yesterday. This significant accumulation underscores the growing interest of large holders, often considered ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù in the market. These entities can drive prices higher through substantial buying pressure, and their activity is often a precursor to explosive market moves. The broader crypto market is also trending upward, providing a supportive environment for PEPE‚Äôs continued growth. As whales position themselves for further gains, the meme coin‚Äôs trajectory over the next few weeks is expected to be fascinating to watch. Related Reading: XRP Price Forecast ‚Äì Analyst Sets $4 Target After Potential Retrace If current trends persist, PEPE could experience more substantial price increases, fueled by retail enthusiasm and institutional accumulation. However, market participants should remain cautious of potential volatility as the coin navigates its path to sustained highs. PEPE Enters Price Discovery Pepe (PEPE) has reached a new all-time high at $0.0000275, solidifying its place as one of the most resilient performers in the current market. The price is now retesting previous highs as support, a crucial step for bulls to maintain momentum. This level is pivotal, as it could either confirm a continuation of the uptrend or signal a potential reversal. Despite this achievement, PEPE faces uncertainty due to broader market conditions. Bitcoin and the entire crypto market are experiencing heightened volatility, adding an unpredictable element to PEPE‚Äôs price action. For PEPE to sustain its rally, it must hold firmly above the $0.000023 support level over the coming days. Successfully doing so would likely pave the way for a breakout into price discovery, with the potential for even higher highs.

37432673,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318257,1733770227,ImmuneFi Founder Warns of Professional DeFi Hackers Making Hacking a Full-Time Career,"The founder of Web3 bug bounty platform ImmuneFi, Mitchell Amador, has issued a stark warning that hackers are making a ‚Äúfull-time job‚Äù of attacking decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. His words come while a spate of high-profile hacks rock the industry just as the pro-crypto Donald Trump is about to take office, with many in the industry hoping for some long-needed regulatory clarity to help drive out the bad actors. 1/ Over the past few months I have been tracking a series of related compromises for McDonald‚Äôs, Usher, Kabosu Owner, Andy Ayrey, Wiz Khalifa, SPX 6900, etc on X & IG which has resulted in an estimated $3.5M+ stolen via launching Pump Fun meme coins. pic.twitter.com/ViZeHzQy5b ‚Äî ZachXBT (@zachxbt) November 26, 2024 Amador said at the recent Decrypt Web Summit that hacking DeFi protocols has become ‚Äúan infinitely sustainable and viable business‚Äù as hackers seek to unleash ‚Äúmore damage than ever.‚Äù He pointed to their wide skillset nowadays, and said that even when they‚Äôre not hacking, they could be front-running trades using MEV bots, which essentially monitor pending human trades, select the most profitable, and place it before the trader does. Amador also said North Korean hackers‚Äô recent looting of Radiant Capital for $50 million for $50 million was ‚Äúvery exotic‚Äù. He said of it that ‚Äúhuman beings are always the weakest link‚Äù, elaborating: ‚ÄúThey went after the private keys by compromising the underlying machines and spoofing transactions in this funky kind of man-in-the-middle attack.‚Äù Still, Amador remains optimistic about the growing safety of crypto in general, a safety which his company is doing many things to advance. ImmuneFi is hosting what it claims is the world‚Äôs largest bug bounty contest , offering $1.5 million for hackers who find lethal vulnerabilities in Ethereum, the world‚Äôs biggest high-functionality smart contract blockchain. Finally, Amador believes the Republican party‚Äôs recent talk about creating a Federal Bitcoin reserve , is pressuring European countries to ‚Äúbegin adopting crypto more aggressively and to become much more friendly as a result. I‚Äôve seen this with my own eyes.‚Äù The knock-on effect of this, he explains, will be heightened security across the industry. ImmuneFi polices bug bounty sector Last month, ImmuneFi suspended white hat security firm Trust Security for 90 days following allegations the latter had unfairly denied bug bounty payment. Trust Security on its part accused Immunefi of impartiality by siding with a project that allegedly dismissed a critical vulnerability that enables fund theft. The controversy began on November 12, when Trust Security disclosed on X that its team had discovered a critical theft-of-funds vulnerability on a forked mainnet of an undisclosed project. It shared the vulnerability with Immunefi, intending to secure a bounty for the identification of a critical bug. Immunefi claimed the bug was ineligible for a full bounty and offered a smaller payout, which Trust Security rejected, claiming ImmuneFi was backing a ‚Äúnonsense argument‚Äù by the project under scrutiny. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd rather expose the scam and warn hackers than take a few extra Ks in our pocket,‚Äù said Trust Security.

37431905,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98590,1733769875,Cardano‚Äôs Hydra Surpasses Visa with $2 Billion in Transactions in Just 4 Hours,"In a groundbreaking achievement, Cardano‚Äôs layer-2 scaling solution, Hydra, has shattered expectations by processing $2 billion in transactions in just four hours, surpassing the capabilities of global payments giant Visa. The milestone, reported by Financial Index this Sunday, quickly gained traction after Cardano‚Äôs founder, Charles Hoskinson, shared the update on X with a celebratory ‚ÄúMORE‚Äù captioned GIF. Hydra, designed to enhance the throughput and efficiency of the Cardano blockchain significantly, achieves scalability by processing transactions off-chain through a network of parallel ‚Äúheads.‚Äù This approach addresses the scalability challenges many blockchain networks face, reducing latency, slashing transaction fees, and preserving Cardano‚Äôs renowned security standards. This achievement follows a recent historic demonstration in which Hydra facilitated 1 million transactions per second during a live Doom tournament, showcasing its immense capacity for real-time data processing. The event highlighted Hydra‚Äôs potential to support decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, microtransactions, and industries where high-speed transactions are essential. Hydra‚Äôs infrastructure includes 12,000 heads deployed across six global regions, each capable of processing up to 800 transactions per second. This decentralized setup underscores Hydra‚Äôs ability to scale efficiently as transaction volumes grow. Moreover, Hydra‚Äôs architecture allows for zero transaction fees, a significant advantage for reducing costs in the blockchain ecosystem. In addition to Hydra‚Äôs record-breaking performance, Cardano‚Äôs ecosystem continues to evolve with the ongoing development of the Cardano Constitution. This decentralized governance initiative aims to give the community more control over the network. Charles Hoskinson, in an address at the Cardano Constitutional Convention in Argentina earlier last week, emphasized the importance of building a sustainable and inclusive financial system while celebrating Hydra‚Äôs achievements. ‚ÄúWe never give up in Cardano land. Look at Hydra, we finally got there. But, we‚Äôve been talking about it for two years and we finally got to a good part and there‚Äôs so much more work to do‚Ä¶‚Äù he noted . He further explained how Cardano‚Äôs infrastructure is designed to support millions of transactions without compromising decentralization or security, underscoring his vision of Cardano as a global financial system capable of supporting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, the crypto world faces important developments as the Cardano network reaches new heights. George, from the Angry Crypto show, also mentioned how Cardano has been dominating polls, with over 90% of votes in its favor in various blockchain comparisons. This growing community interest is reflected in Cardano‚Äôs global search interest, which has surged by 38% on Google Trends since early November. While Cardano‚Äôs technical advancements are garnering more attention, Trump‚Äôs recent appointment of David Sachs as the U.S. crypto czar has also sparked discussions about the future of crypto regulation. Many in the industry view his appointment as a potentially positive development for the entire crypto sector, including Cardano , as Sachs is seen as a pro-innovation, business-friendly figure who could help drive clearer and more supportive regulatory frameworks for the sector.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/cardanos-hydra-surpasses-visa-with-2-billion-in-transactions-in-just-4-hours/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Currently trading at $49.70, EGLD has gained 10.8% over the past week and an impressive 71% over the last month, reflecting growing investor confidence. Praised by Cyber Capital‚Äôs Justin Bons as the ‚Äú technological Holy Grail of crypto ,‚Äù MultiversX‚Äôs implementation of sharding positions it as a leader in scalability, achieving over 100,000 transactions per second. This sets it apart from competitors like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), which rely on second-layer solutions to address scalability challenges. EGLD seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Key fundamentals driving MultiversX‚Äôs growth MultiversX‚Äôs capped token supply of 31.4 million, combined with its robust DeFi use cases and forthcoming upgrades like sub-second block times, continues to enhance its market appeal. The platform offers users opportunities to earn passive income , generate yield , and benefit from features such as secure proof-of-stake, cross-chain interoperability, on-chain two-factor authentication, and opt-in gasless transactions, reinforcing its position as one of the most advanced blockchain platforms. Strengthening its growth trajectory, MultiversX has forged a collaboration with Alibaba Cloud , paving the way for its strategic push into Asian markets. This partnership aims to onboard Alibaba‚Äôs extensive customer base into the MultiversX ecosystem, a move with the potential to significantly expand its user adoption. The impact of this collaboration is already evident, with EGLD gaining momentum on South Korea‚Äôs largest crypto exchange , Upbit, signaling notable progress in its market expansion efforts. Further strengthening its momentum, EGLD‚Äôs inclusion in Coinbase‚Äôs COIN50 Index, which highlights promising cryptocurrencies, reflects growing institutional confidence. This recognition was amplified on November 13, when Coinbase announced the listing and expansion of six new cryptocurrencies for New York citizens, with MultiversX being a notable addition. This move aligns with the COIN50 Index rebalancing , positioning MultiversX as a key player in the evolving crypto market and setting the stage for further growth as the bull market unfolds. AI predicts EGLD year-end price To gauge EGLD‚Äôs future potential, Finbold leveraged market data and consulted ChatGPT-4o to analyze its prospects. According to the artificial intelligence (AI) model, EGLD is projected to close 2024 trading between $60 and $70, driven by a combination of technological advancements, strategic partnerships, and bullish market sentiment. ChatGPT outlook on EGLD price. Source: ChatGPT/Finbold However, in a bearish scenario influenced by market corrections or macroeconomic pressures, EGLD could retrace to the $40 to $45 range. As MultiversX continues to expand its footprint through innovation and collaboration, its growing reputation as a leader in scalability and security sets the stage for sustained long-term growth.

37431655,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98585,1733769342,Peter Brandt Calls Ripple‚Äôs XRP Chart the ‚ÄúMost Powerful in Crypto‚Äù Amid Path to $20 XRP Price,"XRP has been on an extraordinary price run since Donald Trump‚Äôs surprise presidential election victory in early November, which many see as a catalyst for broader optimism in the crypto space. After rallying by roughly 285% in November alone, XRP began December with continued momentum, climbing an additional 35% despite a minor correction from its $2.9 high to $2.20 earlier last week. Notably, the recent surge in XRP‚Äôs price has reignited bullish sentiment among investors and analysts, with many predicting significant upside potential. On Sunday, veteran market analyst Peter Brandt shared his enthusiasm for the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The pundit described the XRP/USD chart as ‚Äúthe most powerful in all of the crypto world,‚Äù highlighting its breakout from a seven-year triangular consolidation pattern, a move he sees as a strong signal for continued upward momentum. This follows his December 2 analysis, where he highlighted the chart pattern and suggested XRP could rally to $4.50 to $5.00 based on the measured move. Other analysts share similarly optimistic outlooks. Javon Marks pointed out that XRP‚Äôs price has already hit the $2.47 target projected earlier this year. ‚ÄúWith a break and hold above $2.47, the $4.804 target is in play, ‚Äù Marks said , adding that XRP could achieve a new all-time high, with a 90% upside still possible from its current levels. Elsewhere, technical analyst Jaydee highlighted indicators that suggest XRP is primed for a breakout. ‚Äú Adding two indicators gives us better confluence on a potential breakout to ATH,‚Äù he noted, referencing a bullish MACD cross, Stochastic RSI climbing above 80, and price action breaking through key resistance. Meanwhile, other analysts, like Cryptobilbuwoo, have laid out even loftier price targets for XRP, including $6.15 and $26.6, with speculative scenarios reaching as high as $589. These ambitious forecasts are supported by XRP‚Äôs parabolic curve pattern, which has already seen the cryptocurrency surpass four major price targets, $0.64, $0.915, $1.13, and $1.612, since November. Beyond technical factors, fundamental catalysts are also driving optimism. Ripple‚Äôs upcoming RLUSD stablecoin is expected to be pivotal in reducing transaction volatility, making XRP a more attractive option for institutional use. On Sunday, analyst Armando Pantoja described RLUSD as ‚Äúthe path to $20,‚Äù explaining that it could facilitate mass adoption by providing a stable bridge for cross-border transactions. Moreover, Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto stance and policy changes, such as appointing crypto-friendly regulators, are expected to create a more favorable environment for Ripple and XRP in the United States. These developments could help Ripple reclaim its position as a leader in global payment systems, further driving demand for XRP.

Over the weekend, many Coinbase users had taken to X to report account restrictions. Coinbase (@CoinbaseSupport) flippantly started its thread by implying that many of the complaints were ‚ÄúFUD/misinformation‚Äù, a claim that X crypto fact checkers quickly took to task. 1/ There‚Äôs a lot of FUD/misinformation out there about Coinbase restricting accounts. ‚Äî Coinbase Support (@CoinbaseSupport) December 8, 2024 In its thread, Coinbase attributed the restrictions to ‚Äúa surge of new users and old users re-activating their accounts post-election.‚Äù The exchange then elaborated: ‚ÄúAlong with this surge, as is typical with surges, we‚Äôve seen a 2-3x increase in fraudulent attempts.‚Äù In a later tweet in the same thread, the exchange claimed its fraud prevention systems have saved ‚Äúten of millions‚Äù in losses for Coinbase customers. Is Coinbase restricting accounts using VPNs? In what seems like a bit of foreshadowing, last Monday, Coinbase‚Äôs Product Director, Scott Shapiro, told followers on X: ‚ÄúPSA: Don‚Äôt use a VPN to access Coinbase.‚Äù He explained that the exchange‚Äôs security software flagged up VPN users as a potential risk, because ‚Äúattackers always use VPNs‚Äù [emphasis in original].

Shapiro doubled down in his replies to the tweets and two days later posted a tweet thread acknowledging his prior post was ‚Äúpoorly worded‚Äù.

Source: TradingView However, we may not see a real rebound until the 30-period average (orange) drops below the 200-period (blue), at which point overselling will have gone too far. And when it has gone too far, Dogecoin‚Äôs discounted price will entice buyers, who will be looking to buy the dip. We haven‚Äôt seen any major buys from whales in around a week , which indicates a lack of the kind of momentum it will need to push through to $0.50.

The MOVE token has a market cap of $1.8 billion at the time of writing. While the token is listed on cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance and Bybit, it is not listed on Coinbase. This phase is the first phase of the network's infrastructure rollout, allowing providers to deploy core components such as follower nodes, RPC nodes, and indexers. Movement Network stands out as the first blockchain built with the Move programming language to integrate proof-of-stake mechanisms built directly into the Ethereum network. According to Movement Labs, this architecture increases both security and transaction finality thanks to a feature called ‚Äúpost-confirmations,‚Äù which allows transactions to be completed quickly.

Experts Call XRP to Hit Bullish Prices This Cycle","Recent market analysis from Cryptobilbuwoo0 and other top cryptocurrency experts suggests XRP could rally remarkably with multiple strategic price targets. The digital asset‚Äôs recent performance supports this bullish outlook, and signs point to continued growth for the asset as we enter the new year. XRP has demonstrated significant momentum since early November, registering an impressive rally to levels unseen since 2018. Detailed technical analysis indicates a structured price progression beyond typical market fluctuations. Market experts have meticulously tracked XRP‚Äôs price movements, identifying key breakthrough points that substantiate its strong market position, and could lead to even better performance. Technical Analysis and Price Targets Cryptobilbuwoo0 has unveiled a parabolic structure on XRP‚Äôs chart. The analyst‚Äôs research highlights a systematic price advancement that has already achieved multiple predetermined targets. Specifically, the cryptocurrency successfully surpassed four critical price levels: $0.64 on November 12, $0.915 on November 16, $1.13 on November 17, and $1.612 on November 23. Beyond these initial milestones, the analysis points to more ambitious price targets if the asset can maintain the $2 level. The current projection identifies two primary profit-taking levels at $6.15 and $26.6. The targets after those are $50, $113.13, $349, and the potential to reach as high as $589, a level other experts are confident the asset can reach . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Regulatory Context and Market Sentiment Crypto expert Levi (@LeviRietveld) drew an intriguing parallel between XRP‚Äôs market performance and the historical performance of Tesla shares. Levi highlighted the potential for significant value appreciation following extended periods of regulatory challenges and consolidation. The ongoing legal proceedings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have been perceived as a potential catalyst for future growth. Levi noted that Tesla traded sideways for seven years until the company settled with the SEC and the stock price skyrocketed. XRP‚Äôs consolidation is nearing the seven-year mark, and with speculation that the new administration will end the lawsuit , it might experience a similar price explosion. Harry (@HaraldoXRP), another well-known market analyst, provided additional insight into the current market structure. He emphasized the importance of support zones and the potential for continued upward movement. He showed a consolidation pattern on the chart that could precipitate a substantial price breakout. At the time of analysis, XRP was trading at $2.62, representing a 4.86% increase over the preceding 24-hour period. The asset is nearing its recent multi-year high of $2.86, and breaching this level could lead to further gains.

While SOL is now basically flat in the past week, the alt is up by 12% in a month and by 200% in a year, with its momentum remaining solid. And some analysts are arriving at bullish Solana price predictions , with one trader ‚Äì @AltcoinGordon ‚Äì setting $420 as ‚Äú the next obvious target .‚Äù Given Solana‚Äôs enviable fundamentals, and given that the bull market may still be warming up, this is a realistic goal, one SOL could certainly reach by the end of the year. Crypto Analysts Predict $420 for Solana ‚Äì Is This the Rally of the Year? The underlying logic of AltcoinGordon‚Äôs prediction is that SOL has consolidated very firmly around its support level, which currently sits in the $225 region. For him, $420 is an ‚Äúobvious‚Äù goal, and in his chart below he actually annotates this price as SOL‚Äôs ‚Äúfirst target.‚Äù Judging by my expert analysis, Solana is resting on an extremely strong support $420 is the next obvious target. Do you understand? pic.twitter.com/zFyCK3QBMG ‚Äî Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) December 7, 2024 In other words, he seems highly confident that Solana will get somewhere near this level next year, with SOL‚Äôs recent price action supporting his bullishness. Not only has Solana risen by 200% in a year, but it has also increased by just over 1,500% in two years. By contrast, Bitcoin has gained by 470% in a two years while Ethereum is up by 200%. This suggests that Solana enjoys stronger momentum than many other major tokens, including its biggest rival (Ethereum). This is partly because it‚Äôs a newer token than many of its peers, yet it‚Äôs also arguably because its fundamentals are stronger. It‚Äôs now the second-biggest layer-one network in the market in terms of TVL , which in its case has risen by 4,300% since the beginning of January 2023. Christmas and 2025 Price Predictions This is testament to its long-term growth, yet the coin is also looking good in the near term. While it has dipped in the past day, it looks like it‚Äôs very close to hitting a bottom, from which it will bounce up soon. Source: TradingView Its relative strength index (purple) has dipped just below 30 in the past hour, indicating overselling. We also see its 30-period average (orange) dipping below the 200-period average (blue). This is usually a negative sign, in that it indicates further losses, but it also means that a given asset is close to hitting a bottom. As such, we can expect Solana to return to $235 towards the end of the week, before gaining further strength as we near 2025. It could end the year at around $250, while the inauguration of Donald Trump could help push it (and the wider market) to new highs. Assuming the introduction of pro-crypto policies in the coming months, it could cross $300 by Q2 2025, and $350 by Q3.

Following a comprehensive governance overhaul in April, the Sushi DAO formalized its structure with the establishment of the Sushi DAO Foundation and Sushi Labs. This move aims to promote the DAO‚Äôs interests through a multi-token ecosystem, facilitating the launch of new products. Sushi‚Äôs 2025 Strategy Among the planned initiatives is the expansion of SushiSwap beyond Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains, with products like Wara on Solana, and the introduction of Susa, an on-chain order book perpetual DEX built on the N1 network. Additionally, Sushi Labs will focus on advancing SushiSwap‚Äôs aggregation capabilities. The product lineup for 2025 includes Kubo, a perps primitive for delta-neutral strategies, and Blade, a new AMM solution to combat MEV for blue-chip assets. Sushi also plans to scale the SushiSwap Aggregator by integrating more partners. Treasury Diversification Proposal The latest development comes days after SushiSwap proposed a major financial restructuring through its ‚ÄúTreasury Diversification Proposal.‚Äù The goal of the plan is to reduce SushiSwap‚Äôs reliance on its native SUSHI tokens and create a more stable and sustainable treasury. Currently, the Sushi DAO treasury is heavily dependent on SUSHI tokens, which makes it vulnerable to market fluctuations. To address this, Grey has proposed liquidating a significant portion of the SUSHI holdings and reallocating the funds into a diversified portfolio. The new structure will dedicate 70% of the treasury to stablecoins such as USDC and USDT, ensuring liquidity and mitigating risks from market volatility. Another 20% will be invested in established cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, providing both diversification and potential growth opportunities. The remaining 10% will focus on high-potential DeFi tokens, selected after careful risk analysis. If approved, the plan will be implemented gradually through dollar-cost averaging, minimizing market impact. The proposal will undergo a governance vote, allowing the Sushi community to have a say in the final decision.

In a Dec. 9 blog post , Tether noted that millions of users currently utilize the Tether ( USDT ) stablecoin as their bank account. In October, the company released a report that showed 330 million users, represented by on-chain wallets and accounts, had received USDT as of the end of September, 2024. However, the report noted that many more users with USDT solely use it off-chain. This means that adoption for the world‚Äôs largest stablecoin by market cap is wider than the indicated data, Philip Gradwell, head of economics at Tether, said. You might also like: Tether CEO unveils updated stablecoin portfolio roadmap: Bitcoin mining, TradFi and commodity trading USDT on-chain holders As of the start of Q4, 2024, there were 109 million users with USDT in on-chain wallets.

In addition to the 109 million on-chain USDT wallets, Tether estimates that two-thirds, or about 56 million, of wallets that use the stablecoin on centralized platforms are holders. Partner details suggest most crypto exchange users across emerging markets use the platforms to exclusively buy, hold, and transfer USDT on platforms such as Binance, Coinbase, and OKX. According to the Dec. 9 report, a total of 165 million or more hold the stablecoin on-chain. The continued reactivation of wallets amid repeat payments also suggests many more users trust and value USDT‚Äôs utility ‚Äúas a store of value,‚Äù Tether noted. Tens of millions of accounts could hold USDT on centralized exchanges and trading platforms. Notably, 18.7 million wallets hold between one cent and $1 of USDT, while 31.5 million wallets currently hold $1 to $1,000 in USDT.

37431165,https://blockworks.co/news/movement-labs-mainnet-beta,1733767200,MOVE drops following Movement mainnet beta,"This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . One of the more hotly anticipated airdrops is happening today, with the MOVE Token Generation Event (TGE). Movement Labs‚Äô Movement mainnet beta went live on Dec. 5 ahead of today‚Äôs ‚ÄúMoveDrop.‚Äù The Movement chain‚Äôs big idea is to provide the MoveVM execution environment, but settle to Ethereum, with a focus on the scalability and security sides of the typical blockchain trilemma. Movement‚Äôs approach parallels the Eclipse chain‚Äôs use of the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to extend Ethereum‚Äôs capabilities . Just as Eclipse allows Solana developers to interact seamlessly with Ethereum without abandoning the SVM‚Äôs advantages, Movement Labs enables Move developers to branch out from Sui and Aptos , while still taking advantage of Move‚Äôs safety-focus and a high-throughput environment, according to Rushi Manche, co-founder of Movement Labs. ‚ÄúWe are the first and only Move-based Ethereum scaling solution,‚Äù Manche, who comes from an Aptos background, told Blockworks. ‚ÄúSo, if you think of it, all the benefits of Move combined with Ethereum‚Äôs liquidity.‚Äù The TGE distributes up to 10% of the MOVE token supply, designed to reward community contributions and participation. On the first day of trading, MOVE is seeing an $8 billion fully diluted valuation (FDV) down from a high of about $9 billion. That puts it in the vicinity of Celestia ( TIA ) and Mantle Network ( MNT ) on an FDV basis. Movement‚Äôs token plays a role in the network operations, as ‚Äúattestants‚Äù must stake MOVE tokens to offer finality guarantees for transactions. Movement Labs has undergone significant architectural changes during its development. Initially, the project was designed as a standard optimistic rollup on Ethereum. However, optimistic rollups typically have a seven-day period to fully settle on Ethereum. Unlike rollups, Movement does not need to wait for Ethereum finality, thanks to its ‚Äú post-confirmation ‚Äù mechanism. This system, akin to a pre-confirmation , provides a better user experience given a one-second finality, though at the expense of some security guarantees. While Movement does not inherit Ethereum‚Äôs security, the economic collateral from stakers is subject to slashing ‚Äî closer to the Polygon PoS sidechain than to a zk-rollup. ‚ÄúWe need to have an economic stake built up ahead of time, such that if someone‚Äôs malicious or transactions go wrong, we have something to slash,‚Äù Manche said, in justifying the launch of the token before the production version of the Movement mainnet. Developers stand to benefit from Movement‚Äôs architecture. A high-throughput execution environment and improvements to smart contract security are at the core of the Move programming language, which is widely regarded as being safer than Solidity . Some examples of applications already building on the network include the Meridian DEX, lending market Echelon, and Bracket, which offers innovative prediction market tools. Movement‚Äôs competitive strategy is focused on community and developer engagement. ‚ÄúThe moat is in each community, which is something that you can‚Äôt fork,‚Äù Manche said, noting their approach avoids unsustainable practices like incentivized liquidity programs. Manche says Movement is more closely-aligned with other Move-based chains than it is to Ethereum. ‚ÄúObviously, we‚Äôre an odd duck in the EVM and Ethereum community, given the fact that we‚Äôre doing alternative VMs, we have an alternative rollup framework and the architecture of the token design as well,‚Äù Manche said. But there‚Äôs room for the full-range of experimentation in the Ethereum design space to compete with high-throughput chains like Solana, he said.

SOL: A scalable blockchain for high-performance DApps Solana is a blockchain platform focused on scalability and speed, providing a foundation for decentralized applications (dapps). Its native cryptocurrency, SOL, is central to its ecosystem, facilitating transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network supporters. Unlike some platforms, Solana avoids sharding or second-layer solutions, opting for a high-capacity network capable of hosting high-activity products and services. This design attracts developers and investors seeking efficient and flexible development across multiple programming languages. With its architectural choices aimed at faster transactions, SOL holds potential in the cryptocurrency market. In the current market cycle, the coin‚Äôs features make it an attractive option for those interested in scalable blockchain solutions. Ethereum: A leading proof-of-stake blockchain with growing potential Ethereum is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain that supports smart contracts and decentralized applications. Launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, it introduced ERC-20 tokens used for governance, utility, and value storage. Ether (ETH) is the native currency, used for transactions and gas fees. In 2022, Ethereum transitioned to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge, enhancing efficiency. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon improve transaction speed and reduce costs. Future plans include sharding to boost scalability. Based on historical price movements and Bitcoin halving cycles, ETH‚Äôs price could reach $6,580.53 next year. With its evolving technology and strong ecosystem, Ethereum looks attractive in the current market cycle. Conclusion Solana and Ethereum may have limited short-term potential. DOGEN, crafted for those seeking luxury and success, is projected to grow 700% by presale‚Äôs end, with potential thousand-fold returns. Following successful tokens like BONK and WIF, DOGEN builds a community of leaders and offers real benefits and exclusive perks to early supporters.

In a post on social media platform X, Armes says Florida will likely create its own stockpile of the leading crypto asset amid support from pro-Bitcoin leaders. ‚ÄúFlorida has a very good chance of creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve this session, which starts in Q1 of 2025.‚Äù Armes says Florida can build its crypto reserve by using a small portion of the state‚Äôs pension fund, which already invests in Bitcoin and crypto-related assets. ‚Äú[We can] leverage our $185.7 billion pension fund (4th largest in the U.S.) to allocate a small percentage to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation‚Ä¶Just investing ONE percent of our pension fund into Bitcoin would be $1.857 billion.‚Äù He says Florida can also tap into its budget surplus to invest in Bitcoin without cutting essential services. ‚ÄúInflation and time will eat away at any budget surpluses we have.

37432831,https://invezz.com/?p=2379592,1733766486,"Colombia ranks 4th in LATAM for Bitcoin revenues, earning $6.79 billion in 2024","According to Chainalysis‚Äô Geography of Cryptocurrency Report 2024 , Colombia has emerged as a major player in the regional cryptocurrency environment. The country ranked fourth in Bitcoin transactions, having amassed more than US$6.788 billion during the same period. The latest increase in Bitcoin‚Äôs value, surpassing a critical milestone of US$100,000, coincided with a government declaration by the newly elected president Donald Trump. This development caused waves in global markets, increasing valuations for corporations with Bitcoin holdings and raising the cryptocurrency assets of countries like El Salvador. However, the consequences of this increase go beyond the bounds of established economies and wealthy investors. According to industry experts, Bitcoin‚Äôs soaring price and more favourable laws under the US government, alongside the potential establishment of a Bitcoin strategic reserve, poised the cryptocurrency to gain enhanced legitimacy and a growing user base. Colombia‚Äôs rising cryptocurrency adoption However, the Geography of Cryptocurrency Report 2024 by Chainalysis indicates the level of adoption of these digital activities in the region, with Colombia ranking fifth in the region among those who use a variety of cryptocurrencies the most, with US$28.455 million received between the second semester of 2023 and the first semester of 2024. Although Bitcoin inflows have not yet eclipsed remittances from outside, it is worth noting that this share is greater than 50%. With potential barriers to record remittance inflows during Trump‚Äôs presidency, the importance of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin may grow, providing Colombians with an appealing option for transfer and investment. According to Juanita Rodr√≠guez Kattah, Bitso‚Äôs country manager in Colombia, the Bitcoin record emphasizes the importance of studying and understanding the fundamentals of cryptocurrency. The arrival at this historical price confirms that bitcoin‚Äôs value is being strengthened by the confidence and support of businesses, institutional investors, and governments around the world.‚Äù Comparative adoption rates in Latin America Colombia‚Äôs Bitcoin adoption rate is now at 13.7%. In comparison, neighbouring nations have varied levels of Bitcoin engagement: Brazil has 14.2%, Argentina has 14.7%, and Mexico leads with a significant 19.3%. However, with a boom in interest and investment in Bitcoin among Colombian consumers, these rankings may vary in the future years as consumer attitudes and legal frameworks evolve. Stablecoins: a major player in the Colombian crypto market Beyond Bitcoin, stablecoins have established a distinct niche in Mexico‚Äôs cryptocurrency market. Globally, stablecoins account for 44.7% of all cryptocurrency transactions, followed by altcoins at 24.6% and Bitcoin at 22.3%. Notably, stablecoins dominate the Colombian market, accounting for a remarkable 66% of transactions. This distinguishes Colombia as the country with the highest relevance for stablecoins in the region, followed by Argentina (61.8%), Brazil (59.8%), and Venezuela (56.4%). In terms of financial impact, stablecoin income in Colombia reached US$3.178 billion by June 2024, highlighting the importance of stablecoins in the country‚Äôs crypto economy. This development suggests a strong desire among Colombian investors to find stability and security in digital assets tied to traditional currencies. The future of cryptocurrencies in Colombia As Colombia navigates the growing cryptocurrency landscape, it has the opportunity to strengthen its position not only as a major player in Bitcoin adoption but also as a pioneer in stablecoin usage in Latin America. The combination of favourable regulatory settings and rising consumer demand points to a promising future for cryptocurrencies in Colombia, where people are rapidly adopting these digital assets for investment and remittance purposes. Overall, the developments around Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in Colombia mirror broader tendencies poised to influence the region‚Äôs financial and economic fabric, indicating a transformative moment in which digital currencies may play a vital role in determining financial futures.

37430216,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=625035,1733766421,TON Accelerator partners with Bybit for Web3 project integration,"TON Accelerator has added Bybit as its partner for its Synergy program. The Synergy program has already set aside $5M in grants for projects offering cross-chain solutions. TON Accelerator has added Bybit as the latest partner for its Synergy program. Bybit will become a partner by offering liquidity opportunities for projects in the first TON Accelerator cohort of projects. The first cross-chain partnership includes the native Toncoin chain and Manta, an EVM-compatible L2 chain. For now, the Synergy cohort of projects is still unknown, as the program is in the application stage, even before making selections. TON Accelerator outlined its preferred types of projects, among which is the presence of a universal Web3 wallet. The platform seeks its own version of the Phantom wallet, which carries four main chains and aims to offer cross-chain transfers for tokens and stablecoins. Other sample projects include cross-chain DeFi and yield platforms, multi-chain payments, staking, and collaterals, as well as cross-compatible DEX. Projects on TON Accelerator may also propose cross-chain games or AI agents. Bybit to offer marketing opportunities for Web3 projects Bybit has already established its position as the second-largest exchange by trading volumes after Binance. The market boasts more than 40M active users, compared to 240M for Binance. The exchange offers more than 300 token pairs and provides both centralized trading and Web3 services. The partnership is also linked to the Bybit Web3 program, which aims to create an open ecosystem for all projects. Bybit has already onboarded more than 130M wallets from over 30 major on-chain ecosystems. Bybit Web3 has already built a suite of widely used products for holding, swapping, collecting, and growing Web3 assets. The exchange operator provides low-risk wallets and access points for a global user base. The market operator will offer Synergy projects mentoring and marketing support, including onboarding assistance and visibility advice for each startup. Another key feature of Bybit is its ability to provide liquidity and jump-start trading for new projects. ‚Äú TON Accelerator‚Äôs partnership with Bybit marks a significant milestone for the TON ecosystem, ‚Äù said Sophia Rusconi, Head of Acceleration at TON Accelerator. ‚Äú The Synergy Cohort is set to accelerate the next wave of founders and startups, bridging the TON and EVM ecosystems ,‚Äù Rusconi said. TON projects will also gain access to the Bybit Web3 wallet, along with training on integration between Toncoin‚Äôs native chain and other EVM networks. The Synergy-supported projects will connect a potential user base of 950 million Telegram subscribers to available pools of cross-chain liquidity. Bybit will also offer access to $8.18 billion in daily liquidity, with more than $15 billion in value locked. Bybit has the potential to expand the Toncoin ecosystem, which has so far relied primarily on decentralized activity or its Binance listings. Toncoin ecosystem seeks additional liquidity For now, the TON ecosystem remains relatively isolated. Other chains are also retaining their liquidity, despite a drive to bridge more value. The TON Accelerator projects will offer specific gateways for cross-chain liquidity, encouraging more inflows and outflows. In total, cross-chain bridges handle $17.92 billion in monthly volumes, an encouraging indicator for the inclusion of TON startups. The TON chain, however, still has a relatively modest total value locked (TVL) of $328 million, but it holds $1.21 billion in stablecoin supply. This supply could potentially offer significant liquidity for payments and DeFi activities. Despite having its native USDT version, the Toncoin ecosystem remains disconnected from broader token transfers or wrapped Ethereum assets. Additionally, there is no mechanism for the backward adoption of Toncoin tokens into the Ethereum ecosystem. As a result, Toncoin ecosystem tokens are largely isolated from broader liquidity flows, existing outside the mainstream meme token space and general token trading activity. Even top Toncoin tokens are valued at just $19 billion , despite widespread adoption into real user wallets. Toncoin tokens are also predominantly tied to gaming applications, and not all are compatible with DeFi protocols or lending platforms. The ecosystem includes meme tokens and two primary DEXs, StonFi and DeDust, but it lags behind other blockchain ecosystems in terms of liquidity and integration. Some Toncoin assets are accessible via the Binance Web3 wallet ; however, Binance has not explicitly established liquidity for its TON ecosystem partner.

Riot noted that it intends to offer a $500 million private convertible senior notes, due in 2030. Riot Offers $500M Convertible Notes As revealed in a press release , this offering is contingent upon market conditions and other relevant factors. The notes target institutional buyers who qualify under Rule 144A of the Securities Act. Riot plans to use the money from these offers to purchase BTC, aligning with the broader market optimism over the flagship crypto‚Äôs future movements. Riot also plans to grant the initial purchasers an option to buy an additional $75 million aggregate principal amount of the notes. This is slated within three days beginning on and including the date on which the notes are first issued. Riot‚Äôs Strategic BTC Purchase However, the mining giant highlighted that there is no certainty as to whether, when, or on the terms of completion. This means the offering remains subject to market and other risk conditions. As announced, the notes will comprise Riot‚Äôs unsecured senior obligations, which are not expected to bear interest. Depending on its choice, Riot may convert the notes into cash, MARA common stock, or both. Riot intends to use the net proceeds of this offering to buy more Bitcoin and for general corporate purposes.

Trump‚Äôs Tesla (TRUMTESLA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMTESLA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump‚Äôs Tesla can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump‚Äôs Tesla could become the next viral memecoin. Trump‚Äôs Tesla launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.

The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

The XRP price is currently trading at $2.40, down 15% from its yearly high. In a major concern for the bulls, the whales appear to be rotating their capital to Ethereum meme coins. While XRP dips, the Pepe coin is skyrocketing and reached a new all-time high today. Another frog-themed Ethereum meme token Pepe Unchained is set to launch tomorrow amid much hype and FOMO. Prominent investors are eyeing up to 100x returns from this microcap. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Fails To Spark Rally In 60 Minutes Interview Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse sat down with CBS News's Margaret Brennan for last Sunday‚Äôs 60 Minutes show. While the show was largely about the crypto industry‚Äôs role in this year‚Äôs Presidential election, the bulls had hoped that XRP‚Äôs mention could spark a rally in the asset. Instead, the XRP army was largely furious regarding the host‚Äôs apparent mischaracterization of Ripple and the blockchain industry. Even Garlinghouse posted his disappointment on X, highlighting how Brennan failed to mention that XRP is not a security following Judge Torres‚Äôs last year‚Äôs ruling. Crypto made its debut on @60Minutes tonight ‚Äì there‚Äôs no doubt that these technologies will continue to become more and more mainstream - with influence and reach that will only continue to grow. A few things I do want to comment on after watching:I spoke with Margaret‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 9, 2024 However, XRP‚Äôs mention as the third-largest cryptocurrency in the interview should still attract retail investors in the upcoming bull market. There is also speculation that Garlinghouse could next sit with popular podcast host Joe Rogan. Nevertheless, the asset faces major downside risk in the short term. Expert Predicts The XRP Price Can Dip Another 40% Experienced traders have repeatedly highlighted the importance of securing profits in a bull market. It could now potentially be time for XRP spot holders to lock in their profits and buy back at a lower price. The XRP price is headed for another retest of the $2.24 support level - 6th time in just over a week. Owing to the low-high structure in the daily timeframe and the declining volume, experts are concerned that the upcoming retest could finally result in a breakdown. Prominent crypto analyst Ninja highlights that the XRP price could see another 30% to 40% correction in the coming weeks, forming a local bottom at the $1.40 - $1.70 range. thank me later $XRP pic.twitter.com/hsrUAJksLL ‚Äî Ninja (@Ninjascalp) December 7, 2024 Meanwhile, the bulls are hoping for another successful retest of the aforementioned support, which could pave the way for a new all-time high. Smart Money Investors Pivot To Meme Coins Prominent crypto investors appear to be rotating to Ethereum meme coins like Pepe and Floki. The Pepe price reached a new all-time high on Monday, trading above the $0.000027 mark.

This is higher than the pre-Binance valuation of meme coins like First Neiro On Ethereum and Act I: The Prophecy. Pepe Unchained is a high-utility meme coin, which separates it from the run-of-the-mill coins that launch daily in the crypto market. For instance, the project‚Äôs Layer-2 blockchain is set to launch soon as well, seeking to be the ‚Äúgo-to chain for meme coin development and trading‚Äù.

The analyst suggested that things could turn out differently for DOGE as its price action hasn‚Äôt exactly followed this historical pattern. What Next For The Dogecoin Price In an X post, Master Kenobi suggested that the 91-day sequence scenario may have been invalidated for the Dogecoin price. He explained that the chart had only touched the green trendline and failed to break through the yellow or orange trendline. This green trendline is at $0.46, which the DOGE price touched last week. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bull Run: Analyst Reveals Why BTC Will Hit Its Top A Month From Now Below $150,000 However, the Dogecoin price failed to touch the yellow or orange trendline, which is at around $2 and $4, respectively. Before now, the crypto analyst predicted that Dogecoin could break above $1 and at least touch $2 this month as this 91-day pattern gets completed. Meanwhile, Master Kenobi also explained why Dogecoin closing last week in the green is significant. The crypto analyst noted that the weekly close in the green marks the eighth consecutive green week for the Dogecoin price, marking the second time this has happened. Statistically, Master Kenobi opined that this is not the most favorable configuration for the DOGE price, suggesting that the foremost meme coin might be in uncharted waters. However, based on Master Kenobi‚Äôs earlier Dogecoin price update, DOGE recording its eighth consecutive green week is something to keep an eye on. The last time this happened was during the final stage of the 2017 bull market, with a rally that began in November and ended in January with a 1,750% price increase during that period. Therefore, if history were to repeat itself, the Dogecoin price could still record massive gains ahead. In November, DOGE recorded a price gain of 161%, providing a bullish outlook for the foremost meme coin. Meanwhile, the December candle is currently green, although DOGE has yet to come close to its November gains. DOGE Is Far From A Price Breakout Crypto analyst Kevin Capital has asserted that the Dogecoin price is still far from a breakout. He made this statement while revealing that DOGE is currently at the macro golden pocket with 0.703 and 0.786 right above, stretching to $0.60. Related Reading: Technical Analysis Puts XRP Price Above $5 In Next 3 Days, Whales Buy $288 Worth Of XRP In line with this, the crypto analyst remarked that anything price action below $0.60 should be treated with major caution as Dogecoin is far from a breakout of any kind. Kevin also called for market analysts to stop with the endless euphoria as the Dogecoin price is nowhere near the level at which a breakout can be expected. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.44, down almost 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Solana‚Äôs SOL: Powering a high-performance blockchain for decentralized applications Solana is a blockchain platform built for scalability, offering a robust foundation for decentralized applications (dApps). Its innovative architecture enables faster transactions and supports development across multiple programming languages, making it a preferred choice for developers. The platform‚Äôs native cryptocurrency, SOL, plays a central role in its ecosystem. SOL facilitates transactions, powers custom programs, and rewards network participants. It also underpins the operation of Solana‚Äôs ecosystem by providing access to a wide array of projects built on the platform. Exploring AVAX: The Layer-1 blockchain with low fees and fast transactions AVAX is the native token of Avalanche, a Layer-1 blockchain known for its low fees and quick transactions. Avalanche can handle up to 4,500 transactions per second. It uses a hybrid consensus mechanism that blends classical and Nakamoto principles, aiming for transaction finality in less than two seconds. The platform features three interoperable chains: X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain. These chains facilitate various operations like transactions and smart contract executions. AVAX plays a key role in the ecosystem. It is used for transaction fees, staking to secure the network, and operating Subnets. Subnets allow users to launch customizable blockchains. AVAX demonstrates strong utility in payments, staking, and enabling the creation of custom tokens and blockchains. Chainlink: Bridging smart contracts with real-world data Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that helps smart contracts connect with external data sources, APIs, and systems. It uses a reputation score to ensure the accuracy of data provided by oracles. By bridging blockchain and the outside world, Chainlink enhances what smart contracts can do, allowing them to interact with real-world applications. Its three-step process involves oracles retrieving data, aggregating it for accuracy, and securely delivering it to smart contracts. Chainlink combines on-chain and off-chain architectures for efficient data handling. The LINK token plays a key role in this system. It rewards node operators for supplying data, supports staking to secure the network, and serves as payment for data services, ensuring the network‚Äôs reliability and decentralization. Polkadot: Bridging blockchains for seamless interconnectivity Polkadot is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency that enables secure communication between different blockchains. It allows value and data to be shared between networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin without intermediaries. Using parachains, Polkadot enhances speed and scalability, processing more transactions than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The DOT token is used for governance and staking, letting holders participate in the network‚Äôs development and verify transactions. Created by Ethereum co-creator Gavin Wood and supported by the Web3 Foundation, Polkadot aims to create more interconnected and efficient blockchains. Conclusion While established coins like SOL, AVAX, LINK, and DOT show potential, their short-term growth may be limited. In contrast, CYBRO presents unique opportunities for investors to enhance their earnings. Utilizing AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain, CYBRO offers features such as high staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. With easy deposits and withdrawals, it provides a smooth user experience. Emphasizing transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO has attracted significant interest from major crypto investors and influencers.

While institutional capital and the incoming pro-crypto administration have sent the crypto king to new heights, retail has been pouring into altcoins like DOGE, which has the total market cap for all of crypto close to touching $4 trillion . Bitcoin‚Äôs six-figure price tag, however, is leaving some retail investors feeling priced out. But the advent of Bitcoin DeFi promises to help retail investors get a piece of this trillion-dollar store-of-value pie. Bitcoin DeFi has exploded into popularity this year, going from having just $300 million in total value locked (TVL) to now surpassing $3.58 billion . The key to unlocking further potential for Bitcoin lies in developers making BTC an active asset that allows anyone holding BTC to put it to work and earn rewards. A prominent project helping make this reality is the Bitcoin Layer 2 GOAT Network . GOAT not only rewards BTC holders; it also rewards holders of the OG meme coin DOGE, so that a wider swath of the crypto population can take part in this wealth creation and protection. After all, BTC‚Äôs triple-digit percentage gains this year and better-than-500% uptrend since its Nov. 2022 low have outdone almost all notable altcoins. Now GOAT Network, which helps bring scalability and transaction efficiency to Layer 1, is running a pre-mining campaign ahead of its mainnet launch. The ‚ÄúEarly GOAT‚Äù Pre-Mining campaign provides both BTC and DOGE holders the opportunity to earn juicy BTC mining rewards. The concept of dual-staking both BTC and DOGE to earn BTC mining rewards was introduced by the project recently, after GOAT launched public testnet. Users who supply either BTC or DOGE will reap an annual Mining Rewards Rate of greater than 30%, payable in both BTC and GOAT points. This way, users can start building their BTC holdings, which, unlike newer and shinier coins, can be a better bet for sustained long-term success. The campaign is currently live, and you can join by visiting the official website, premining.GOAT.network to start contributing to the BTC pool (live on the main Bitcoin network) and/or the DOGE pool, live on BNB Chain. These boosted rewards, as part of the ‚ÄúEarly GOAT‚Äù Pre-Mining campaign ahead of the L2‚Äôs official mainnet launch, are only for a limited time. The project has capped these pools at 20 BTC and 5 million DOGE tokens, so once these thresholds are reached, no more deposits will be allowed. With this campaign, GOAT Network aims to get BTC and DOGE holders ready for what‚Äôs to come early next year, as the network readies for mainnet launch. Once GOAT launches its mainnet, users will be able to supply BTC or DOGE into one of GOAT‚Äôs sequencer nodes, helping to secure the network while earning sustainable BTC yield. After mainnet goes live, users will be able to earn even more BTC rewards with the help of BTCFi and MemeFi dApps, kickstarting a new era of sustainable Bitcoin yield and driving Bitcoin DeFi momentum even higher.

In one of his rare public appearances, Ma spoke at the Ant Group‚Äôs 20th-anniversary celebrations, expressing enthusiasm for Ant‚Äôs AI-powered future.

His speech at the Ant Group‚Äôs event was the first time he publicly addressed the company‚Äôs team since Ant withdrew its IPO in November 2020. Jack Ma pointed out that past challenges and tests have helped fintech mature and benefit from criticism. Since then, the fintech firm has overhauled its business model to comply with financial regulation. Ant has also reorganized its units to push for breakthroughs in AI-powered products that play key roles in people‚Äôs lives in China. He said : ‚ÄúWe were lucky to capture the Internet opportunities 20 years ago‚Ä¶In the next 20 years, AI will bring changes far beyond the imagination, AI will bring on an even greater era.‚Äù ‚Äì Jack Ma A Reuters report claimed that Alipay, owned by Ant, controlled over half of the mobile payment market at the end of 2023. Statista estimated that China‚Äôs mobile payments services would process over $8 trillion in 2024 and $12.8 trillion in 2029. Ant expands global business with AI-powered products Ant announced earlier on September 6th that it would pay special attention to advancing AI technology through its products. Ant‚Äôs AI-driven Zhixiaobao app was able to help users hail taxis, order meals, as well as discover local entertainment and dining options. The app would also access services in the Alipay digital payment app. Ma said the ‚Äòonly way to determine success or failure‚Äô was whether Ant could create truly valuable and unique products soon. Cyril Han, Ant Group‚Äôs President, said the fintech firm was committed to harnessing AI‚Äôs potential to ensure that ‚Äúlife assistants‚Äù like Zhixiaobao become valuable tools for everyday life. Ant described Zhixiaobao as an AI-native application powered by Ant Group‚Äôs Bailing foundation model, which was approved by the Chinese government last year. The firm also announced the rollout of AI-powered products for merchants and insurance companies. Eric Jing, the outgoing CEO, said the firm‚Äôs success in AI products was underpinned by the relaying of passion and vision from one generation of Ant employees to the next. Jing encouraged younger generations to always be ready to step up and take on strategic responsibilities because they understood the future better and had the strength to create it. A recent Ant statement confirmed that the firm‚Äôs cross-border mobile payment solution connected over 90 million merchants in 66 markets to over $1.6 billion user accounts as of November.

It successfully raised $30 million in its initial issuance under El Salvador‚Äôs new Digital Asset Law. Built on the Liquid Network, USTBL combines the stability of government-backed securities with the transparency and efficiency of Bitcoin‚Äôs immutable ledger. The offering highlights the potential of tokenised assets to democratise investment opportunities and reshape global financial markets, setting the stage for a more inclusive and efficient financial future. A Look at NexBridge‚Äôs Tokenised US Treasury Offering and Capital Raise NexBridge , a digital asset issuer based in El Salvador, recently achieved a significant milestone with the launch of USTBL , a tokenised US Treasury Bill offering. USTBL was offered on Blockstream‚Äôs Liquid Network , raising $30 million during its initial public issuance through Bitfinex Securities. NexBridge states it has plans to scale the issuance to $200 million. Founded to bridge traditional finance and blockchain technology, NexBridge specializes in tokenising real-world assets (RWAs) such as securities and private investment funds. The company aims to enhance financial inclusivity and accessibility by leveraging Bitcoin‚Äôs efficiency and transparency. NexBridge operates as both a Digital Asset Issuer and a licensed Digital Asset Service Provider, ensuring that its offerings meet the compliance standards of the El Salvador digital assets regulator, the Comision Nacional de Activos Digitales (or CNAD), while integrating seamlessly with global financial systems. The USTBL issuance was a continuation of NexBridge‚Äôs mission to modernise asset management and demonstrate the potential of digital assets to transform conventional financial instruments. The tokenisation of RWAs, such as US Treasuries, reflects a growing trend in traditional finance, driven by the Bitcoin blockchain‚Äôs ability to improve efficiency, liquidity, and accessibility. Tokenised assets enable 24/7 trading, faster settlement times, and lower transaction costs by reducing reliance on intermediaries. This trend has gained traction with major players like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton introducing similar offerings, signalling a shift in how institutional and retail investors interact with financial assets. NexBridge‚Äôs USTBL aligns with this broader movement, offering a model that combines the stability of traditional investments with the adaptability of digital finance. The success of NexBridge‚Äôs USTBL demonstrates the potential of tokenised assets to reshape the global financial landscape. By democratising access to traditionally exclusive markets, tokenisation enables broader participation and increases liquidity for assets like government bonds and real estate. Looking ahead, regulatory clarity and technological advancements will be critical to the widespread adoption of tokenized RWAs. NexBridge‚Äôs compliance with El Salvador‚Äôs forward-thinking Digital Asset Law positions it as a pioneer in this space, paving the way for more accessible, transparent, and efficient financial markets. As tokenisation becomes more prevalent, it may redefine how financial assets are issued, traded, and managed on a global scale. What are the Implications of Widespread Tokenisation and the Crypto-fication of Traditional Markets? The digitalisation of traditional finance and capital markets, driven by the increasing acceptance and regulation of Bitcoin and digital assets, holds transformative potential. By integrating digital asset technologies with legacy systems, these markets can achieve enhanced efficiency, transparency, and accessibility. Tokenisation of traditional assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate enables fractional ownership, allowing a broader range of investors to participate with lower capital requirements. This democratisation of finance could bridge the gap between institutional and retail investors, potentially reshaping the global investment landscape. Regulatory clarity and oversight are key to fostering trust and encouraging broader adoption of digital assets among institutional players and retail participants alike. Widespread tokenisation could unlock significant capital inflows into both traditional and digital markets. Institutional investors, previously hesitant due to regulatory uncertainties and perceived risks, may increasingly allocate funds to tokenised assets, attracted by their enhanced liquidity, lower transaction costs, and real-time settlement capabilities. Retail investors, enabled by fractional ownership and 24/7 trading opportunities, could further drive demand. The integration of tokenised assets into Decentralised Finance (DeFi) ecosystems also creates opportunities for innovative financial strategies, such as collateralised lending, automated portfolio rebalancing, and yield farming, which could amplify overall market activity and liquidity. The ‚Äúcrypto-fication‚Äù of legacy financial markets is likely to spur the development of new investment products and trends. Tokenised funds, exchange-traded tokens, and blockchain-based derivatives could become mainstream, offering dynamic and programmable investment solutions tailored to individual needs. Real-world assets, such as real estate or infrastructure projects, could be tokenised and made available to a global pool of investors. Additionally, hybrid financial instruments combining traditional securities with decentralised mechanisms may emerge, offering a unique blend of stability and innovation. Crowdfunding and project financing could also evolve, allowing entrepreneurs to raise capital directly through tokenised equity or debt offerings. The growing integration of decentralised digital assets with centralised FinTech platforms is blurring traditional boundaries, creating a hybrid financial ecosystem that combines the transparency and programmability of digital assets with the accessibility and regulatory compliance of conventional finance. As these trends evolve, the broader financial ecosystem may see a convergence of traditional finance and DeFi, leading to a more integrated and interoperable global market. Digital asset transparency and programmability could help mitigate risks of fraud and inefficiency. This transition could ultimately redefine asset ownership, streamline cross-border transactions, and enable the creation of a truly global, inclusive financial system. However, achieving this potential will require addressing challenges such as regulatory alignment, technological interoperability, and investor education to ensure a smooth and sustainable integration of rapidly evolving digital assets into the fabric of far more conservative traditional finance. Will More Nimble Emerging Economies Be the Real Winners Moving Forward? Emerging markets, historically constrained by limited access to liquidity and global investment opportunities, are uniquely positioned to leverage the technological advancements of tokenisation and digital assets. Unlike developed nations with entrenched financial systems and complex regulatory frameworks, these economies can adopt and implement cutting-edge digital asset-focused infrastructure with greater agility. This advantage mirrors the way many emerging markets bypassed costly and resource-intensive landline infrastructure, instead adopting wireless, cell phone-based systems to achieve widespread connectivity. By embracing tokenisation as a foundation for modernising their economies, emerging markets have the potential to leapfrog traditional financial models, enabling more efficient capital flows and broader economic participation. The regulatory flexibility often found in emerging markets plays a significant role in their ability to iterate and innovate rapidly in the adoption of digital assets. Without the burden of legacy systems and entrenched interests that often hinder change in developed economies, these nations can design forward-looking policies that encourage investment, technological experimentation, and entrepreneurial activity. For instance, countries such as El Salvador, which has actively embraced Bitcoin as legal tender, demonstrate how emerging markets can use digital assets to enhance financial inclusion and attract foreign capital. These nimble regulatory environments allow emerging markets to serve as testbeds for new financial technologies, potentially setting global benchmarks for innovation. Tokenisation offers emerging markets a powerful tool to unlock liquidity in previously illiquid assets such as real estate, agricultural goods, and infrastructure projects. By converting these assets into digital tokens that can be traded on digital asset platforms, emerging economies can attract global investors, democratise access to local opportunities, and generate new capital inflows. This increased liquidity can stimulate domestic growth and strengthen resilience against external economic shocks. Additionally, tokenisation provides a more secure, transparent, and efficient mechanism for managing and trading assets, reducing barriers to entry for both domestic and international participants, and combatting corruption or financial mismanagement common in emerging markets. The ability of emerging markets to leapfrog developed nations in adopting digital assets could reshape the global economic landscape. By starting with a more flexible and technologically advanced foundation, these economies can redefine traditional power dynamics in global finance, positioning themselves as leaders in the blockchain-driven transformation of capital markets. Over time, this shift could narrow the gap between developed and developing nations, fostering greater economic equity and innovation on a global scale. Emerging markets that successfully harness the potential of tokenisation may not only enhance their own financial ecosystems but also influence the evolution of financial systems worldwide.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Pepe rallies 23% to a new ATH with surging volume, while Wall Street Pepe offers a strong alternative. Table of Contents Pepe Breaks Out With Strong Volume Traders Target SHIB Market Cap Can Wall Street Pepe provide bigger returns than Pepe? Pepe has rallied 23% in the past week to a new all-time high (ATH). It‚Äôs trading volume is surging and other meme coins are struggling to stay afloat. Is this a good time to buy Pepe, or could the newly launched Wall Street Pepe offer a better alternative? Pepe Breaks Out With Strong Volume Pepe coin‚Äôs volume is much higher than the market average today, which shows traders remain interested despite its heightened price. Right now, Pepe is trading at $0.00002642, up 4% today, 26% this week, and 143% this month. It currently holds a $11.1 billion market cap and a $6.4 billion 24-hour trading volume. That‚Äôs over $4 billion more than Shiba Inu‚Äôs volume and under $300 million less than Dogecoin‚Äôs. Pepe‚Äôs volume even surpasses that of Solana , which currently holds a $110 billion market cap. Its high volume confirms that the uptrend is strong, laying the way for more growth.

Currently, Shiba Inu holds an $18.3 billion valuation, which is $7.2 billion higher than Pepe‚Äôs. Analyst Jameson says that the ‚Äúflippening is inevitable.‚Äù Based on Shiba Inu‚Äôs current market cap, Pepe must rise by 64% to catch up. This would push its price to $0.0000433. $PEPE : $7.5B daily volume, 68% of market cap $SHIB : $2.4B daily volume, 13% of market cap The flippening is inevitable, it's only a matter of time. pic.twitter.com/EN8NjztN7O ‚Äî Jameson (@jamesonxbt) December 8, 2024 However, the crypto market is amidst a bullish phase, in which Shiba Inu will also rise. So, should Pepe flip Shiba Inu as expected, we could see its price climb higher than that.

In the tweet, the analyst also points to Dogecoin‚Äôs ATH, which would give a Pepe price of $0.0002. This week, Pepe has created an ATH while tokens like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin struggled to stay in the green. This highlights the project‚Äôs market appeal and momentum, which could provide legs for much more gains in the coming months. Based on all of this, Shiba Inu‚Äôs ATH market cap ‚Äì which would place Pepe at a price of $0.00012 ‚Äì seems an optimistic but achievable target for this market cycle. In a storm of euphoria, Pepe could potentially even reach Dogecoin‚Äôs previous high market cap at a price of $0.0002. However, as Pepe shows strength, a new Pepe-related token has entered the market and is making significant gains. The project is called Wall Street Pepe, and it has raised over $3 million in its opening five days of presale. Can Wall Street Pepe provide bigger returns than Pepe? Profit-hungry investors are rotating to Wall Street Pepe , drawn to its electrifying blend of Pepe coin and Jordan Belfort. The project is building an army of everyday traders who are tired of seeing others get rich and want to become millionaires themselves. Crypto is swamped with whale insider groups who know what to buy, when to buy, and when to sell. Wall Street Pepe is creating his own, and all WEPE holders are invited. It‚Äôs more than a Pepe reboot. This project is fueled by a love of Pepe and inspiration from Jordan Belfot‚Äôs rags-to-riches story, and it‚Äôs providing the community with market-beating tools. As mentioned, it‚Äôll have its own trading insider group. Users can discuss strategies and the best ways to maximize profits. But the project will also provide trading signals and alpha insights, giving users the heads up on the next 100x potential meme coins and more. Users can also earn tokens via staking or submitting their trading ideas to the team. This concept that has never been done before. It‚Äôs using the starpower of two iconic figures to cultivate a community, and then it‚Äôs providing the tools to organize this community into the next group of crypto whales. The presale price is expected to rise throughout the campaign, so prospective buyers should not wait around. For more information, visit the Wall Street Pepe presale website .

37429137,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318295,1733763989,"Ethereum Price Slumps 4% After $4,000 Breakout Failure, But History Suggests More Upside Coming","The Ethereum (ETH) price is pulling back after running into a wall of resistance at the $4,000 level, and was last down around 4% this Monday in the $3,800 area. A bearish divergence on its 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) chart, which also recently just dropped back from overbought conditions, suggests continued near-term downside is a possibility. A re-test of the 21DMA at $3,600, or even resistance turned support in the $3,500 area, are possibilities. Elevated ETH futures funding rates and rising market profitability , per Glassnode data, further highlight the risk of a mid-bull market pullback. But Ethereum bulls shouldn‚Äôt get overly pessimistic, as the medium-term outlook for Ethereum is as strong as it has been for years. Altcoin Season Is Here While much has been made of Ethereum‚Äôs ‚Äúdecline‚Äù relative to some of its rising rivals such as Solana and Sui, this narrative is overstated. Ethereum remains the dominant DeFi chain, retaining a commanding share of trade value-locked smart contracts. Per DeFi Llama , crypto assets worth over $76 billion are locked in smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, a 56% market share. Meanwhile, Ethereum remains the only altcoin to have secured spot ETFs in the USA, making it the major gateway for institutional investors seeking to gain exposure to the altcoin market. All of that means that Ethereum is set to be a major beneficiary of any future altcoin seasons. And altcoin season has arguably already returned. blockchaincenter.net ‚Äòs index recently flew into altcoin season territory. CMC‚Äôs altcoin season index is painting a similar picture. Bitcoin (BTC) dominance also just started to break down in a major way for the first time since early 2021. If history does repeat, BTC.D could be about to crater from its current levels around 56% all the way to around 40%, as a result of altcoin outperformance, not as a result of poor Bitcoin performance. Indeed, the medium-term outlook for the Bitcoin price remains strong. Just under 8 months on from its halving, BTC broke into a new phase of price discovery in November following the positive US Presidential and Congressional election results. A meaningful breakout above $100,000 is yet to materialize, but historic Bitcoin price cycles suggest the top isn‚Äôt in yet, and a move to $150,000 and beyond is on the table for 2025. Where Next for the Ethereum Price? Bitcoin‚Äôs breakout to fresh record highs is a very important development for Ethereum, which tends to follow closely behind the world‚Äôs largest crypto by market cap. In the 2020/2021 bull cycle, when Bitcoin broke out to fresh record highs in December 2020, Ethereum was still substantially below its record levels. In 2020/2021, took ETH an additional month to even test its prior record highs. And then the actual Ethereum price discovery didn‚Äôt kick off until 2 months after Bitcoin price discovery began. We are seeing the exact same setup play out in 2024. If history does repeat, we could see the Ethereum price retest its record highs but fail to break out this month decisively. Real ETH upside price discovery (i.e. a move above $5,000) may need to wait for January 2025. Around this time, there will be plenty of narratives about the positive shift in US crypto regulation as the Trump administration moves into the White House and the new Congressional session begins, meaning plenty of fodder to power a major rally. Ethereum investors need to be patient and not get shaken out in the event of any short-term market dips. Bitcoin‚Äôs price rally suggests further upside could be right around the corner for ETH and Ethereum price predictions are likely to remain bullish.

Amid this ongoing downturn, whale transaction tracker Lookonchain shared a post on X (formerly Twitter), reporting that a newly created wallet had withdrawn a significant 1,850 BTC worth $183.37 million from Binance, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchange. Whale Buys $183 Million Worth Bitcoin However, this notable withdrawal comes at a time when BTC has dropped to a support level near $97,300. Additionally, it follows MicroStrategy‚Äôs acquisition of 21,550 BTC worth $2.1 billion, purchased at an average price of $98,783, as reported by CoinPedia . These recent acquisitions suggest that this whale and the institution are capitalizing on a perfect buy-the-dip opportunity. $335 Million of BTC Outflow from Exchanges In addition to the recent BTC withdrawals by whales and institutions, on-chain analytics firm Coinglass revealed that exchanges have experienced a significant outflow of $335 million worth of Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. This indicates a potential buying opportunity and suggests possible upside momentum in the coming days. Source: Coinglass Bitcoin Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, BTC has been trading in a pattern of higher highs and higher lows since November 11, 2024. Currently, BTC has reached a higher low in this pattern. Source: Trading View Historically, whenever BTC reaches this level, it tends to experience upside momentum. However, this time, investors and traders are speculating about whether the same upside momentum will occur, which might explain the rising interest from whales and institutions. Based on recent price action, there is a strong possibility that BTC could soar by 6.5% to reach the $104,160 level in the coming days. On the positive side, BTC‚Äôs Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 44, near the oversold region, suggesting a potential upside rally in the coming days. Additionally, BTC is trading above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, indicating an uptrend.

Dogecoin‚Äôs Rise: From Meme to Major Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) launched in 2013 as a light-hearted alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies, using a Shiba Inu meme for its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, it has no maximum supply and produces 10,000 new coins every minute. Initially considered a memecoin, it surged in value in 2021, entering the top ten cryptocurrencies with a market cap exceeding $50 billion. This surge was fueled by social media influence, notably from Elon Musk. Created as a joke by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, Dogecoin gained popularity, highlighting the impact of community and social media on financial markets. Its potential lies in its active community and widespread recognition. In the current market cycle, its attractiveness depends on social media engagement and market trends. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Expanding Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency token inspired by Dogecoin, but it operates on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi, SHIB began with a supply of 1 quadrillion tokens. Half were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who donated a significant portion to the India COVID-Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply. SHIB‚Äôs integration with Ethereum enables it to benefit from Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem, including decentralized applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Plans for a future NFT platform and a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance system could expand its utility. SHIB‚Äôs attractiveness in the current market cycle is influenced by its expanding ecosystem and active community engagement. Conclusion With Dogecoin and Shiba Inu showing less short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as the token for those seeking luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by the end of presale and potentially multiply during this altcoin season, DOGEN follows successful tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat. It builds a community of leaders and offers real benefits to early adopters.

According to the press release shared with Cryptonews, the novel index aggregates market prices from validated CoinMarketCap data sources. It‚Äôs refreshed every five minutes and calculated in USD. Notably, the index is rebalanced monthly, with the selection of coins based on their market capitalization ranking. Additionally, the index is calculated as a market capitalization-weighted index. Unsurprisingly, the weight of the top 10 coins per market cap is 90.11%. Source: CoinMarketCap The team noted that, thanks to the index being calculated every five minutes, it provides ‚Äúreal-time transparency into the cryptocurrency market‚Äôs most significant players.‚Äù They described the CMC100 as ‚Äúthe first crypto index to cover such a wide range of assets,‚Äù including emerging sectors like gaming and meme coins. However, it excludes stablecoins and asset-backed wrapper tokens to keep the focus on volatile, market-driven assets. The index is freely accessible and can be embedded into publications and websites through an API. That said, per the team, with a base level of 100 set on 1 January 2024, ‚Äúbacktested performance data is available to provide historical insights and aid in market analysis.‚Äù Meanwhile, the index is governed by CoinMarketCap‚Äôs Benchmark Oversight Committee to ensure compliance with industry standards, manage methodology changes, and address conflicts of interest. You might also like CoinMarketCap Launches ChatGPT Plugin to Simplify Crypto Analysis ‚ÄòVisibility Into Over $3 Trillion in Digital Assets‚Äô The CoinMarketCap team noted that the crypto market continues to evolve. As such, it requires accurate and reliable benchmarks. They argued that the lack of standardized performance metrics has hindered institutional adoption and market transparency. Therefore, the team claims the CoinMarketCap 100 Index works to address this need through several key features. As mentioned above, it comes with real-time updates and monthly rebalances to ensure continued representation of the market. Additionally, it covers approximately 87% of the total crypto market capitalization, as well as various blockchain projects and technologies. The index weights assets based on their market value to provide a proportional view of the market. Moreover, the Benchmark Oversight Committee conducts monthly methodology reviews, said the announcement. Source: CoinMarketCap Meanwhile, in November this year, major crypto exchange Coinbase unveiled its Coinbase 50 Index (COIN50) , a benchmark representing the top 50 digital assets listed on the exchange. It also excludes stablecoins and privacy coins to ensure investability, it said. The index is rebalanced quarterly and currently covers around 80% of the total crypto market cap. Read more below.

37429135,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318280,1733763486,El Salvador to Adjust Bitcoin Policy for $1.3 Billion IMF Loan,"El Salvador is reportedly revising its crypto policy, making Bitcoin acceptance optional as part of a $1.3 billion loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) . According to a recent report by the Financial Times, the agreement includes dropping the legal requirement for businesses to accept Bitcoin as payment. This move addresses concerns raised by the IMF regarding financial concerns in the country‚Äôs economy. El Salvador‚Äôs Financial Concerns El Salvador‚Äôs decision to alter its Bitcoin policy would be part of broader financial commitments required to secure the IMF loan. The government also plans to reduce its budget deficit by 3.5 percentage points of GDP over three years through spending cuts and tax reforms. An IMF mission is currently in San Salvador to finalize the terms of the agreement with President Nayib Bukele‚Äôs administration, as revealed by two people close to the talks. The deal is expected to bring additional financial support, including $1 billion from the World Bank and another $1 billion from the Inter-American Development Bank. The IMF has consistently opposed El Salvador‚Äôs decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, citing risks to financial stability. The country‚Äôs 2021 law mandating Bitcoin acceptance as payment had been a point of contention in negotiations with the IMF. Nayib Bukele‚Äôs Push for Bitcoin Adoption Under the new agreement, businesses will no longer be legally required to accept Bitcoin as payment. The government has also committed to increasing its financial reserves from $11 billion to $15 billion to strengthen economic stability. El Salvador has accumulated Bitcoin in its national reserves , with President Bukele frequently purchasing during price dips. The value of these reserves was reported at over $600 million last month, representing a 127% gain, according to Bukele‚Äôs social media updates. Based on the report, while Bitcoin adoption has been promoted as part of El Salvador‚Äôs efforts to rebrand itself as a global crypto hub, the majority of Salvadorans continue to rely on the US dollar for daily transactions.

The Tesla and SpaceX CEO shared a playful post with his son, sparking excitement across the meme coin ecosystem. This unexpected rally has positioned BABYDOGE near its all-time high (ATH), showcasing the power of online culture and community-driven tokens in driving market trends. The tweet that ignited the BABYDOGE rally On December 7, Elon Musk shared a playful tweet featuring a black-and-white photo of himself and his son, styled with the words ‚ÄúDogefather‚Äù and ‚ÄúDogeson,‚Äù nodding to the iconic The Godfather film. He followed it with a mention of ‚ÄúDoge & Minidoge,‚Äù setting off a frenzy within the meme coin community. Elon Musk @elonmusk ¬∑ Follow 10:56 AM ¬∑ Dec 7, 2024 57.6K Reply Copy link Read 3.6K replies While the tweet didn‚Äôt explicitly reference Baby Doge Coin, its impact was immediate. BABYDOGE surged over 80%, climbing from $0.0000000002443 to $0.0000000006164. The meme coin outperformed its counterparts, like Dogecoin (DOGE), which saw a modest about 5% increase. This surge brought BABYDOGE close to its ATH of $0.000000006345, achieved in January 2022. The Baby Doge community amplified the buzz, responding to Musk‚Äôs post with enthusiasm, which helped drive the rally. Adding to the rally, whale accumulation has also boosted Baby Doge‚Äôs momentum. Large holder net flows shifted from a net outflow to a net inflow of over 10 trillion BABYDOGE within days. The meme coin has also seen a 44% increase in futures open interest, indicating strong demand among traders. Source: Coinglass Baby Doge ecosystem growth and market momentum Baby Doge‚Äôs surge is not solely driven by Musk‚Äôs tweet. Baby Doge Coin‚Äôs ecosystem has been expanding rapidly, providing strong fundamentals. Recently, the project renounced its token contract on Solana and secured a spot listing on Binance, increasing its accessibility and liquidity. Furthermore, the introduction of the ‚Äúpuppy.fun‚Äù platform‚Äîa meme token launchpad‚Äîpositions BABYDOGE as an innovator in the meme coin space. Key metrics underscore BABYDOGE‚Äôs growing prominence. Its market cap has soared to $978.86 million, with a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $557 million. The token‚Äôs supply dynamics remain robust, with 162 quadrillion coins circulating out of a total and max supply of 420 quadrillion. Technical indicators suggest further bullish momentum. Although the Relative Strength Index signals overbought conditions, strong investor interest appears to override market cooldown expectations. The MACD confirms strong buying pressure, while BABYDOGE‚Äôs price consistently exceeds the upper Bollinger Band. As Baby Doge approaches its ATH, the combination of Musk‚Äôs influence, whale activity, and a growing ecosystem highlights its potential to redefine the meme coin market.

Five alternative coins are positioned to potentially surpass the performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum. This anticipated shift could redefine the digital currency landscape. What are these promising tokens, and what factors could drive them ahead of the market leaders? Explore the details to uncover these emerging contenders. You might also like: Why market leaders are flocking to CYBRO over XRP and ADA CYBRO fast-tracks listing after $7M presale and 450% token surge CYBRO , the AI-powered multichain platform, is gearing up for an early exchange listing following a remarkable presale that garnered $7 million and attracted close to 20,000 investors. As a frontrunner in the decentralized finance space, CYBRO aims to bring unique features that redefine DeFi engagement. During the presale, CYBRO tokens soared by 450%, climbing from $0.01 to $0.055, with a listing price set at $0.06. Analysts are buzzing about the token‚Äôs growth prospects, as the surging demand indicates that CYBRO may be the next big DeFi disruptor. This isn‚Äôt just another token listing; it‚Äôs the dawn of a new era for DeFi enthusiasts. CYBRO is democratizing decentralized finance with advanced tools, including staking, yield farming, and innovative lending solutions. Here‚Äôs a snapshot of its remarkable milestones: CYBRO App Launch: Over 30 versatile vaults launched, tailored to provide competitive APYs for a broad array of investment strategies. Blast Index Debut: Simplifies DeFi participation with a one-click integration into various lending protocols. Platform Growth: Establishes a foundation for a streamlined, intuitive DeFi ecosystem that will keep expanding. The roadmap through 2025 promises further growth with upcoming features like leverage farming, advanced lending aggregation, and AI-enhanced user tools. With growing excitement around AI-driven financial platforms, CYBRO‚Äôs listing at $0.06 is expected to attract a wide range of investors, from retail to institutional. The project‚Äôs solid fundamentals combined with rapid presale growth, position it as a must-watch player in the evolving DeFi space. XRP: A decentralized currency for fast, secure transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency supported by the XRP Ledger. It is designed to be fast, low-cost, and open. It allows borderless transactions that are resistant to censorship or counterfeiting. XRP operates on a decentralized system without a central authority. This makes transactions irreversible and secure. XRP does not require a bank account for settlements. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was launched with an initial supply of 100 billion, with 80 billion gifted to Ripple for further development. Ripple, initially called OpenCoin Inc., uses XRP to improve network liquidity and support the ecosystem. The name XRP comes from ‚Äúripple credits,‚Äù reflecting its goal to facilitate seamless payment transfers across different currencies. Cardano: A scalable and sustainable blockchain platform Cardano is a flexible blockchain platform designed for smart contracts. This allows developers to build decentralized apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, lets users store value, make payments, and stake on the network. Cardano uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is more energy-efficient than proof-of-work models. The blockchain is divided into two layers: the Settlement Layer for transactions and the Computing Layer for smart contracts. This design can enhance transaction processing up to a million transactions per second. Cardano‚Äôs native tokens offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts, setting a new standard for blockchain efficiency and scalability. Solana‚Äôs SOL: Powering a scalable blockchain for decentralized apps Solana is a blockchain platform designed for scalability, providing a foundation for decentralized applications (dapps). It stands out with architectural choices that aim for faster transactions and flexible development options across multiple programming languages. SOL is Solana‚Äôs native cryptocurrency, central to its ecosystem. It facilitates transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards network supporters. The SOL coin holds value by underpinning the operation of the Solana ecosystem, rewarding participants, and allowing users access to a suite of projects on Solana. Unlike some platforms, Solana avoids sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability, aiming to attract developers and investors with its high-capacity network and potential for hosting high-activity products and services. TRON: Empowering content creators through decentralization TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain platform designed to give digital content creators full ownership rights over their work. Developed by the Tron Foundation, it aims to help creators who often receive only a small portion of the income generated from their content. TRON allows content consumers to reward creators directly, removing intermediaries like YouTube or Facebook. The platform supports smart contracts, various blockchain systems, and decentralized applications (dApps). It uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin, where transactions occur on a public ledger that users can track. TRON enables developers to create dApps and offers the ability to share content openly without concerns about transaction fees. Conclusion As the bull run of 2024 unfolds, investors seek opportunities beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. While tokens like XRP, ADA, SOL, and TRX may show less potential in the short term, CYBRO stands out as a promising alternative. This advanced DeFi platform leverages AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain to maximize investor earnings. With features like lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, CYBRO offers a superior user experience with seamless deposits and withdrawals. Its emphasis on transparency, compliance, and quality distinguishes it in the market.

Against this backdrop, some altcoins are standing out, showcasing compelling buy setups despite the market‚Äôs challenges. Finbold turned to the RSI heatmap from CoinGlass on December 9 to identify altcoins poised for growth, presenting attractive opportunities for traders and investors in the current market climate. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin ( DOGE ) is currently flashing strong buy signals across key technical indicators, presenting a compelling opportunity for traders and investors. With an average 24-hour RSI of 62.13, DOGE remains in a bullish momentum zone, signaling strength without entering overbought territory. The cryptocurrency has seen a minor 24-hour price dip of 2.52%, trading at $0.44838, which reflects a healthy correction rather than a trend reversal. This dip presents an attractive entry point for those looking to capitalize on a potential upward move. Furthermore, the one-week RSI at 83.56 shows sustained buying interest over a longer timeframe, signaling strong market confidence. Crypto Market RSI 24-hour Heatmap: DOGE. Source: CoinGlass Historically, DOGE has shown sharp rebounds following similar consolidations, with its technical indicators suggesting the potential for another rally. Reinforcing this outlook, all major exponential and simple moving averages (from 10 to 200 periods) signal a ‚Äúbuy,‚Äù pointing to consistent upward momentum across different timeframes. Supporting this, oscillators remain neutral, signaling stability and a lack of bearish pressure. The Average Directional Index (ADX) further validates the strength of DOGE‚Äôs current directional trend. With a combination of bullish RSI levels, supportive moving averages, and a favorable market structure, DOGE offers a high-probability setup for traders and investors looking to capture short- to medium-term gains. Enjin Coin (ENJ) Enjin Coin ( ENJ ) also exhibits a strong buying opportunity supported by a solid technical foundation and favorable market dynamics. With a 24-hour RSI of 64.46, ENJ outperforms the market average RSI of 62.13, indicating sustained bullish momentum while remaining below the overbought threshold of 70. This suggests the potential for further upward movement, making ENJ an attractive prospect in the current market environment. The technical outlook is further reinforced by 11 out of 14 moving average indicators signaling a ‚Äúbuy.‚Äù Key moving averages, such as the 50 EMA, 100 EMA, and 200 EMA, are significantly below ENJ‚Äôs current price of $0.33883, providing robust support and highlighting consistent upward momentum across short-, medium-, and long-term timeframes. Crypto Market RSI 24-hour Heatmap: ENJ. Source: CoinGlass This alignment of moving averages underscores the asset‚Äôs favorable trajectory and enhances its appeal for both traders and investors. Although ENJ has experienced a 6.53% price decline over the past 24 hours, this correction presents a compelling entry point for those seeking to capitalize on its next potential rebound. Corrections of this nature are often followed by upward movement, particularly when supported by strong technical indicators. Meanwhile, oscillators remain neutral, signaling market stability and a lack of significant bearish pressure. Short-term momentum indicators, including the MACD also exhibit mild bearish signals, which warrant close monitoring. However, the broader technical framework strongly favors bullish continuation, positioning ENJ as an asset with significant potential for medium- to long-term gains. While these cryptocurrencies demonstrate strong momentum and robust technical support, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge that short-term market fluctuations could influence their trajectories. Investors are encouraged to approach these opportunities with caution, perform comprehensive research, and ensure their investment strategies align with their risk tolerance and long-term financial objectives.

37428529,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=625020,1733762332,Altcoin‚Äôs bull run threatens market volatility ‚Äì It‚Äôs not welcome,"Since November 1, altcoins have grown enormously in the crypto market, with gains reaching 99.31%. This has sparked speculation about the start of altcoin season‚Äîa bull rally of sorts. This comes particularly as Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance has declined over the last month, raising fears about volatility. The crypto market is always unpredictable and volatile. An intriguing phenomenon that many investors have observed is that the value of many altcoins decreases when the price of Bitcoin (BTC) increases. Donald Trump‚Äôs recent victory in the U.S. presidential election has resulted in major upside for the altcoin market. However, some market analysts have expressed concern that the current rally may be temporary. Why is the Altcoin bull rally threatening volatility? Liquidity flow is the most significant factor contributing to the current market environment. This is why the majority of altcoins are traded against the BTC pair on exchanges. This induces traders to dispose of altcoins to acquire Bitcoin, thereby capitalizing on its expansion. As a result of their decline, the value of these altcoins decreases. According to on-chain data, speculators who use leverage are incurring annualized expenses of 48% to 72% to sustain their positions. In an uptrend, these costs may not appear to be prohibitive; however, if the market stabilizes or experiences a decline, they could result in forced liquidations or sell-offs. One analyst cautions that these circumstances are similar to those that occurred in late 2021 when coins such as XRP and Solana experienced rapid corrections following lengthy rallies. According to the analyst, traders may continue to exhibit irrationality. However, he said, ‚ÄúWe are at the point where teams and VCs start clipping more aggressively.‚Äù Source: X He observes that financing rates exceeding 100% annually indicate an increase in risk in a market that is already characterized by increased leverage and declining spot trading volumes. According to Sergei Gorev from YouHodler, these coins are not to blame. He explained that the rise of Bitcoin above $100,000 has had even more of an effect on the market. Sergei added that because Bitcoin is linked to the S&P 500, its changes could have an effect on the whole crypto market. He went further to say that divergences in technical charts and the rising value of the US dollar are signs that the rise might not last. In the past, round-number milestones for Bitcoin have caused times of higher volatility, which has added to the uncertainty. Although these concerns persist, there is still considerable optimism regarding the altcoin market. Some traders contend that the present circumstances could result in a long-term bull market, while others believe that historical trends and the increasing cost of funding indicate a potential decline. It is evident that the market is currently unpredictable, as evidenced by the ongoing divergence of opinions. Is the alt season over? In a December 5 ‚ÄúVolatility Review‚Äù report, Bybit observed that Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin since the US elections. The report observed that traders are beginning to adjust their preferences toward ETH, as evidenced by the significant shift in the ETH/BTC ratio. The ratio increased from a minimum of 0.31 on November 19 to over 0.4 on Friday. Additionally, the decline in Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance has been attributed to ETH‚Äôs outperformance against Bitcoin, which has sparked speculation about the onset of an altcoin season. Crypto market Dominance: Source ‚Äì TradingView Also, yesterday, an altcoin called Monero (XMR) was trading at $201.75 and experienced a 2% increase. The price, however, has gone down to $198.19. Both Bitcoin and altcoins are experiencing market stagnation. As the days approach Trump‚Äôs inauguration, one of the two could eventually become bullish. Why is there such an inverse relationship between Bitcoin and altcoins? One is Bitcoin dominance. When Bitcoin climbs in price, investors go from altcoins to Bitcoin, a more reliable investment tool. Bitcoin‚Äôs market value rises, leading altcoins to fall. The market sentiment also causes the inverse. Bitcoin typically sets crypto trends. Bitcoin spikes are usually good for the market. Investors choose Bitcoin over lesser-known altcoins in this era. This reduces altcoin capital flows. In addition, market manipulation equally causes the inverse. The Bitcoin market is volatile. Big investors (called ‚Äúwhales‚Äù) may pump and dump altcoin values. When Bitcoin rises, these people may sell altcoins to buy more Bitcoin, causing market instability. FOMO is also a major reason. When Bitcoin prices rise, the FOMO effect pushes investors to put more money into it. They worry about missing out on this growing trend, reducing cryptocurrency investment and value. Despite popular belief, cryptocurrencies do not necessarily follow Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory. Certain events or news about Bitcoin can raise its price without boosting altcoins, causing a price gap. This is called a lack of correlation.

Tether Releases New Report,"Tether, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, reported in its new report that 109 million on-chain wallets held USDT as of the beginning of the 4th quarter of 2024. This figure is more than double the number of wallets holding Bitcoin and approaching the 128 million wallets holding Ethereum. In addition to on-chain activity, centralized platforms have also become a significant part of the USDT ecosystem. Tether reported that 86 million accounts on such platforms have held on-chain USDT deposits. Centralized exchanges recorded 4.5 billion web visits in the first three quarters of 2024, with nearly half (46%) of those visits originating from emerging markets. Many users in these regions primarily use USDT on-platform for holding and trading, but the exact balances are known only to the platforms. Some interesting data from the report shared by Tether are as follows: Active wallets: Of the 330 million on-chain accounts that have ever purchased USDT, at least a third (109 million) and likely close to half still hold USDT today. Reactivation trends: USDT usage is cyclical for many users. Approximately 29% of wallets currently holding less than $0.01 in USDT have been reactivated in the past, typically for recurring payments. Related News: Watch Out: 38 Altcoins Have Massive Token Unlocks in the New Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List Interestingly, a significant portion of wallets have small balances, with 18.7 million wallets holding more than $0.01 but less than $1 USDT. USDT continues to dominate the stablecoin space, with four times more wallets than all other stablecoins combined. As of November 1, 54 million on-chain wallets held more than $0.01 in USDT, compared to just 13.8 million wallets for all other stablecoins, a staggering 4:1 ratio. *This is not investment advice.

Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) dropped by about 7% to a low of $0.000030, much lower than this month‚Äôs high of $0.000033. Other popular meme coins also experienced declines, with Popcat ( POPCAT ), Peanut the Squirrel, and Dogwifhat ( WIF ) leading the way. Shiba Inu‚Äôs retreat coincided with a significant drop in its burn rate. Data from ShibBurn showed the burn rate decreased by about 90% to 413,412 SHIB coins. This marked a sharp decline after a wallet burned 250 million SHIB coins in a single transaction on Friday. Shiba Inu has burned over 410 trillion SHIB coins since its inception, leaving 589 trillion coins in circulation. This burning process is expected to continue over the long term, which could make the remaining coins more valuable. Meanwhile, data from Shiba Inu‚Äôs ecosystem indicates positive growth. Shibarium, a layer-2 network, has processed over 623 million transactions since its inception. It recently surpassed 2 million total addresses, while total BONE transfers have risen to nearly 2 million. ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange within the ecosystem, has achieved over $28 million in total value locked .

37427978,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374061,1733761504,Short-Term Pain but Long-Term Rally for Ripple (XRP): Analyst,"TL:DR; Ripple‚Äôs native token is poised to retrace in the short term, but that could be just the start of another rally that will push it to a new all-time high, said a popular analyst. XRP has cooled off after the recent gains and is actually 10% down on the week. XRP took off a little late after Trump‚Äôs decisive win in the US presidential elections, but once it did, it stole the show completely. At one point, its gains had gone above 420% on a monthly scale as the asset climbed to a multi-year peak of almost $3. As the community was praising and celebrating the move in anticipation of a new all-time high ($3.4, according to CoinGecko), XRP‚Äôs momentum vanished, and it started to lose value gradually. As mentioned above, the token now stands at an 11% weekly decline, and its price struggles to reclaim $2.4. Consequently, it lost its third spot in terms of market cap to Tether. Moreover, popular analyst Ali expects a further decline in the short term. $XRP : 3 consecutive bull pennants! We should all be praying for a retest of $2.25 to buy the dip and target $4.40! pic.twitter.com/KgXnM929yk ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) December 9, 2024 However, the strategist remains highly bullish on XRP‚Äôs long-term potential as he believes it will bounce off the $2.25 support and skyrocket to a new all-time high of $4.4. This would put its market cap at over $250 billion. As reported earlier, Ali also put even more optimistic targets for XRP in the future, including a ‚Äòconservative‚Äô one of $8.4 and a highly outrageous one of $48.12. With such quite optimistic predictions for XRP‚Äôs price during this cycle, one can‚Äôt help but wonder whether Ripple‚Äôs native token has the legs to surpass Ethereum (ETH) in terms of market cap.

According to Arkham Intelligence, an on-chain analytics platform, the Royal Government of Bhutan transferred 406 BTC worth around $40 million. Bhutan‚Äôs Strategic Offloading Amidst Bitcoin Rally The transfer is the latest in a series of transfers in the last two months. Despite the Bitcoin price rally, the Royal Government of Bhutan has been unloading its holdings at regular intervals. The movement of its Bitcoin holdings intensified after Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in the U.S. November election. This offloading of its Bitcoin stake is happening despite the price rally of the world‚Äôs leading digital asset. The 406 BTC, which moved to QCPCapital, has sparked speculation among stakeholders as some believe it is an outright sale. This development contrasts with those of other countries like Brazil eyeing Bitcoin reserve. Data shows the Bhutan government‚Äôs holdings have dwindled to 11,781 BTC in its treasury. Notwithstanding, the Royal Government of Bhutan still ranks among the top five largest government holders. Is Profit the Motivation Behind the Sales? The cumulative value of the remaining Bitcoin in the Royal Government of Bhutan‚Äôs treasury stands at approximately $1.164 billion. This massive chest is due to Bhutan being a major mining site for Bitcoin. Notably, the government‚Äôs acquisitions came mainly from its hydro-powered mining operations. However, since late October 2024 , when the price of Bitcoin surged, the government has offloaded 1,696 BTC. Market observers suggest that they were taking advantage of the price increase to make a profit. The sales made at an average price of $81,999 has generated approximately $139 million. All of the transactions have flowed either through Binance or QCPCapital. Long-Term Bitcoin Projections Interestingly, despite Bitcoin breaching the psychological level of $100,000 in a historic climb, the asset has struggled to reach a support level. As of this writing, data shows that BTC exchanges are at $98,977, down by 1.19%. However, its market volume has risen by 59.40% to $66.41 billion. Analysts speculate that despite the continued fluctuations in the volatile market, Bitcoin will soar in 2025 in the long term Some have predicted that before the end of 2025, BTC will cross $200,000.

Though Bitcoin and Ethereum are always fighting for the limelight, some altcoins now appear to have what it takes to make a great return on investments. Among them are Rexas Finance (RXS), Dogecoin (DOGE), Uniswap (UNI), Sui (SUI), and Dogwifhat (WIF). These tokens are gradually establishing themselves due to their unique aspects, strong community base, and market possibilities. Let‚Äôs see the merits of these altcoins. Rexas Finance (RXS): Moving Toward an Entirely New Era of Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance is leading the charge on the tokenization of real assets in the blockchain space, allowing for small proportions of ownership in a safe and secure framework. Whether it‚Äôs real estate or fine art, RXS opens up previously inaccessible markets to investors. This disruption is generating a lot of excitement around the platform. The presale of RXS tokens can be described as a remarkable success. It raised more than $23 million, and over 308 million tokens were sold in all stages. In stage 9, token prices are at $0.125, making it an attractive valuation for investors. It has been anticipated that the token will list on major exchanges in 2025 and bring high returns for early investors. The ecosystem incorporates features such as Rexas Estate for real estate investment, Rexas Launchpad for decentralized fundraising, and Rexas GenAI for designing NFTs using AI technology. A CertiK audit and listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko prove the safety and transparency of the projects after all objectives were successfully reached. To boost participation, Rexas Finance is also holding a $1 million giveaway where early investors will each receive 50,000 RXS tokens. This makes Rexas Finance more attractive as a long-term investment. Its significance in the real world and tremendous scope for growth make it an essential asset in your portfolio. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Meme Coin That Just Does Not Die Out Currently, Dogecoin is selling at $0.001425, which is indicative of hope for investors. Popular communities always support Dogecoin, and so it has lots of global significance. Reportedly, Dogecoin has one of the largest fan bases out there, along with plenty of attention. Currently, DOGE is a very great cryptocurrency and worth investing in. Dogecoin has the support of well-known figures such as Elon Musk, who consistently mentions Dogecoin as a mode of payment through various social platforms (such as Twitter), propelling interest in the coin further. With the growing number of payment methods and integration into more ecosystems, it seems that DOGE is here to stay for a long period. Furthermore, with its potential to grow, Dogecoin is once again in the spotlight as a favored coin with undeniable vitality and strength. Throughout its near-decade history, Dogecoin has witnessed multiple rallies and highs in terms of worth. With that in mind, and for the future, it is quite possibly a very safe investment. Uniswap (UNI): The DeFi Powerhouse Uniswap, the biggest peer-to-peer token exchanging platform in existence, is one of the key players in the world‚Äôs very first distributed economy. The current priced of the Uniswap token is $23.77 and the volume of trades per day rests around $45 million. Despite the lack of demand, Uniswap remains one of the most respected platforms and a core part of Ethereum. Due to its reliance on code and smart contracts, large transaction costs began to dwindle the need for a lot of centralization. Uniswap features a consistent amount of beneficial concepts, including Layer 2 solutions, which help it become a leader in the economy. If the number of people switching their focus toward decentralized financial platforms increases, this will result in a nice return on investment, making UNI a core development. Sui (SUI): The Innovator in Scalability Blockchain Sui, with its $3.87 share price and $11.31 billion market cap, has quickly positioned itself as a favorite, especially among developers and investors, as it‚Äôs a scalable blockchain platform with low transaction costs. Sui boasts unique architecture that guarantees high throughput and fast transaction speeds, facilitating its use within decentralized applications and NFTs. Given the growing adoption and active developer community, Sui is likely to provide a return on investment in the months ahead. Such a low price level, in comparison to other similar capabilities, is of great interest to retail as well as institutional investors. Dogwifhat (WIF): The Next Meme Coin Slated for Management Dogwifhat (WIF) is rapidly establishing itself as a genuine top-tier competitor in the meme coin space. It brings a compelling combination of humor, community, and practical functionality. With a target price of $3.30 and a market capitalization of $3.29 billion, WIF seems appealing to speculative investors wishing to aim above the target. Unlike many meme coins that gather traction purely based on hype, Dogwifhat aims to develop a sustainable ecosystem with actual utility. Owing to its creative marketing and active community, it is an interesting coin to watch during this bull run. Given the right momentum, WIF may duplicate the success of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Early investors could see excellent profits. Conclusion As the crypto market welcomes its biggest bull run in a very long time, picking the right tokens can be a game-changer. On the other hand, options like Rexas Finance, Dogecoin, Uniswap, Sui, and Dogwifhat have their benefits and suit different types of investment. These currencies can be added to the forecast from utility-sustaining projects to speculative meme coins. However, the most promising token is Rexas Finance (RXS), which combines all the elements of becoming a market leader. Don‚Äôt sit idle, as these opportunities never last long, especially with rising market momentum.

Though iGaming is yet to pick up steam in this cycle, gaming remains the largest entertainment industry by some distance. Killing two birds with one stone, gaming also has the added benefit of combining both speculative hype with innovative utility, not one or the other. The Sandbox and Gala are two noteworthy cryptos that experienced immense growth in the previous bull run. As investors seek out new gems that could rival or supersede these cryptocurrencies, analysts are confident that Rollblock could be the next big thing to take the DeFi gaming space by storm. Here‚Äôs why they are bullish. Can The Sandbox Recover From Post Bitcoin Halving Lows? The Sandbox is a leading metaverse platform that allows users to create, own, and monetize virtual worlds. During the 2021 bull run, The Sandbox garnered viral attention and reached an all-time high of $8.44, boasting partnerships ranging from major brands to celebrities like Snoop Dogg to boot. With gaming tokens experiencing a meandered resurgence, The Sandbox is reclaiming some momentum, rallying over 50% in the past week amidst wider bullish market trends. Driven by renewed interest in the metaverse and gaming platforms like The Sandbox as retail money continues to breach the market, The Sandbox has already recovered from its post Bitcoin halving lows. However, smart money is scouting for the next gem, with Rollblock emerging as a strong candidate for massive gains. Will Gala‚Äôs Expanding Ecosystem Help It Achieve 2021 Level Returns? Gala is a blockchain-based ecosystem that aims to revolutionize the gaming and entertainment industries. In the 2021 bull run, Gala made waves by enabling users to own in-game monetary assets as NFTs and rewarding participation with the native GALA token. As momentum slowly builds in the gaming sector, Gala has surged 50% in the past seven days. Adding to the excitement around Gala Games specifically, an extension of the Gala ecosystem called ‚ÄúGala Film‚Äù with the $FILM token has launched this week. With a vibrant entertainment ecosystem spanning games, music, and most recently film, Gala Games is poised to expand its reach when other sectors gain traction besides memes, large cap blue chips, and layer-1‚Äôs. Next In Line: Why Rollblock Is Poised For Greatness Within Crypto Gaming Rollblock is reshaping the gaming landscape with its innovative play-to-earn casino platform, combining strong fundamentals, rewarding incentives, and remarkable growth prospects. With analysts forecasting 20x returns by year-end and even greater gains in 2025, Rollblock is quickly becoming a standout in the space that could replicate the returns of cryptos like The Sandbox and Gala Games from 2021. Boasting a library of over 7,000 games, Rollblock caters to a diverse audience with popular casino classics like poker and blackjack alongside blockchain-exclusive titles. The forthcoming launch of sports betting will enhance its appeal further, cementing its reputation as an all-in-one entertainment hub. For investors, Rollblock‚Äôs revenue-sharing model offers a compelling incentive. Thirty percent of weekly profits are used for RBLK token buybacks, with half burned to reduce supply and the other half distributed as staking rewards, fostering long-term value and stability. Currently priced at $0.041 in its ninth presale stage, RBLK presents an exciting investment opportunity, with momentum building ahead of a predicted gaming rally in 2025.

XRP has dropped 5.4% in 24 hours and trades at $2.39. The eminent launch of RLUSD and approval of XRP ETFs under Trump could push XRP higher. XRP has dropped 5.44% in the past 24 hours, trading at $2.39, holding a market cap of $136.44 billion. This decline moves XRP out of the top three cryptocurrencies, sliding to be the fourth-largest by valuation. While XRP rallied to $2.70 during the recent market upswing, it failed to sustain the momentum, retreating from the $3 milestone. CoinMarketCap data shows that XRP remains up 320% over the last 30 days, despite undergoing what analysts describe as a necessary correction. Key Bearish Indicators for XRP The daily chart reveals a downtrend forming as multiple candles closed below previous highs.

37428010,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624980,1733761118,Michael Saylor hails Riot Platforms as a company on the Bitcoin Standard ‚Äì Here‚Äôs why,"Michael Saylor said the Riot company is on the Bitcoin standard, following its decision to offer a substantial amount of its convertible senior notes in a private offering, whose proceeds would be used to buy additional Bitcoin. According to a recent press release, Riot Platforms, a leading Bitcoin mining and digital infrastructure firm with a market value of $4.3 billion, is planning to hold a private offering of $500 million in convertible senior notes set to mature in 2030. Per the release, the offering will be limited to qualified institutional investors. Riot reportedly plans to allocate the net proceeds from the offering toward acquiring more Bitcoin and supporting general corporate activities. MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor took to X to laud Riot for unveiling its plan to expand its BTC holdings, calling it a ‚Äúcompany on the Bitcoin Standard.‚Äù $RIOT is a company on the #Bitcoin Standard. https://t.co/qRJ3JIc0BU ‚Äî Michael Saylor‚ö°Ô∏è (@saylor) December 9, 2024 Riot also stated that the unsecured, senior-ranking notes will mature on January 15, 2030, unless repurchased, redeemed, or converted earlier. Starting January 20, 2028, the company has the option to redeem the notes partially or in full for cash, provided at least $50 million in principal remains outstanding. According to the press release, Riot also intends to provide the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase up to an additional $75 million aggregate principal amount of the notes within three days beginning on and including the date on which the notes are first issued. Also, the offering is subject to the market and other factors, and no guarantee can be made as to whether, when, or under what terms it will be completed. Riot Platforms Bitcoin strategy keeps the company financially ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô Riot Platforms is seemingly looking to mimic MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin investment policy to buy more BTC alongside its mining operations. As of November 2024, the company held 11,425 Bitcoin, a 55% increase from its year-to-date holdings, per a Stock Titan insight . During the same month, Riot Platforms announced it had mined 495 Bitcoin, maintaining steady month-over-month output despite a 7% rise in network difficulty. The company‚Äôs operational hash rate also grew by 13% compared to the previous month. Riot aims to establish itself as the world‚Äôs foremost Bitcoin-driven infrastructure platform and continues to lead the industry in vertically integrated Bitcoin mining. With operations on a significant scale, the company projects a self-mining hash rate capacity of 34.9 EH/s by the close of FY2024. As of the latest quarter, Riot maintained a strong financial standing, reporting $590.6 million in working capital, including $355.7 million in cash and $190.1 million in marketable equity securities. An InvestingPro analysis reveals that Riot currently holds more cash than debt, reflecting a current ratio of 5.68. However, the data also indicates the company is rapidly consuming its cash reserves, although financial analysts project a strong revenue growth rate of 32% for the year. Meanwhile, Riot Platforms saw its stock price drop by 5.8% to 12.05 pre-market trading, after unveiling plans for a private offering. The company‚Äôs shares had faced a rough start in 2024, facing a 19.7% decline within the first six months of 2024. However, in the second half, RIOT has gained by 22%, according to NASDAQ data. Bitcoin price outlook In other news, Bitcoin (BTC) saw a slight intraday decline of 1%, trading at $98,804. Over the last 24 hours, the cryptocurrency fluctuated between a low of $97,986.82 and a high of $101,399.98. The crypto had briefly dipped below the $100,000 threshold earlier in the day, continuing its consolidation phase while encountering resistance around the $101,000 level. After reaching a high of $101,267 early in trading, BTC fell to $99,113 before making a small recovery to its current price point. Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin has seen a significant gain of nearly 50% since the November 2024 U.S. presidential election but is now trading at $99,000 at press time, down 1.15% over the past 24 hours, per Coingecko data .‚Äã A Step-By-Step System To Launching Your Web3 Career and Landing High-Paying Crypto Jobs in 90 Days.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/michael-saylor-praises-riot-on-bitcoin/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37428010.jpeg

37428401,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51677,1733760939,3 Cryptos to Buy Today for Long-Term Investment,"As the cryptocurrency market gears up for another promising year, savvy investors are seeking cryptos to buy today for long-term investment that have strong fundamentals and significant growth potential. The right picks aren‚Äôt just about riding short-term trends‚Äîthey‚Äôre about finding projects that offer innovation, utility, and staying power in an increasingly competitive space. One project making serious waves is Qubetics , which has raised over $5 million in its presale so far and sold more than 288 million $TICS tokens. Alongside Qubetics, we‚Äôll explore Solana and Ethereum, two well-established players that have proven their value and continue to offer substantial opportunities for long-term growth. 1. Qubetics: Revolutionising Blockchain for the Future If you‚Äôre searching for cryptos to buy today for long-term investment, Qubetics should be at the top of your list. This cutting-edge blockchain is reshaping the digital economy with its seamless integration of blockchain networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others. Using advanced chain abstraction, Qubetics ensures interoperability, scalability, and unmatched security, all while addressing real-world financial challenges. The buzz around Qubetics‚Äô presale is undeniable. With tokens priced at just $0.0282, investors have already secured over 288 million $TICS tokens, contributing to a remarkable $5 million raised so far. What makes Qubetics stand out is the immense potential for ROI‚Äîcrypto analysts project that $TICS could reach $15 after its mainnet launch, marking a staggering 58,213% ROI for early supporters. An investment of $12,000 at the presale stage could net you 425,532 $TICS tokens. If prices soar to $15, that investment would skyrocket to $6.38 million, cementing Qubetics as one of the most lucrative cryptos to buy today for long-term investment. Why did this coin make it to this list: Qubetics isn‚Äôt just about hype; its real-world applications include the QubeQode development interface, which simplifies dApp creation, and a tokenised asset marketplace that opens up high-value investment opportunities. With its ability to unify blockchain ecosystems and support cross-chain operations, Qubetics is a top contender for future blockchain dominance. 2. Solana: The High-Speed Contender When discussing cryptos to buy today for long-term investment, Solana inevitably comes up. Known for its high-speed performance, Solana handles over 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) with transaction costs of fractions of a cent. Its Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanism is a game-changer, allowing the blockchain to process transactions faster than most of its competitors. Solana has become a hotspot for developers building decentralised applications (dApps), particularly in the gaming and NFT sectors. The network‚Äôs active user base and growing developer interest have kept Solana relevant even amidst market downturns. Looking forward, analysts predict that Solana‚Äôs price could increase significantly as adoption continues to expand. Why did this coin make it to this list: Solana‚Äôs long-term growth potential lies in its unmatched scalability and robust ecosystem. As more developers and users flock to its platform, it remains a solid choice among cryptos to buy today for long-term investment. 3. Ethereum: The Pioneer of Smart Contracts No list of cryptos to buy today for long-term investment would be complete without Ethereum. As the first blockchain to introduce smart contracts, Ethereum has built an ecosystem that supports thousands of decentralised applications, DeFi protocols, and NFTs. Its recent transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) with the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade has significantly reduced energy consumption and increased scalability, ensuring the network remains future-proof. Ethereum‚Äôs versatility and consistent innovation make it a favourite for both retail and institutional investors. Crypto experts anticipate that its price will climb steadily over the coming years as demand for decentralised applications and blockchain solutions grows. Why did this coin make it to this list: Ethereum‚Äôs dominance in the smart contract space and its commitment to scalability and sustainability make it one of the best cryptos to buy today for long-term investment. With an ever-expanding user base and developer community, it‚Äôs a project that‚Äôs here to stay. Conclusion: Secure Your Spot in the Future of Crypto The cryptocurrency market offers countless opportunities, but selecting the right cryptos to buy today for long-term investment is key to building lasting wealth. Qubetics stands out as a high-potential project with its innovative technology, impressive presale performance, and jaw-dropping ROI projections.

37429134,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318188,1733760357,Schiff Brands Bitcoin ‚ÄòPublic Enemy #1‚Äô Amid Bitcoin Reserve Talks,"Peter Schiff, a prominent gold advocate, has labeled Bitcoin a national security threat and ‚Äúpublic enemy number one.‚Äù His criticism comes amid growing discussions among U.S. federal and state governments about the potential creation of a Bitcoin reserve. Schiff‚Äôs Concerns Grow Amid Trump and Senator Lummis‚Äôs Bitcoin Reserve Plans On December 8, Schiff expressed his concerns in an X post, emphasizing that while it‚Äôs one thing for individuals to spend their money on Bitcoin, it crosses a serious line when government officials begin using public funds to invest in it. Bitcoin has become a national security threat. It's one thing when private citizens voluntarily waste their own money buying #Bitcoin . But it crosses the line when they bribe government officials to squander the public's money buying it. Bitcoin is now public enemy number one. ‚Äî Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 8, 2024 His comments were met with widespread opposition, including a pointed critique from Dan Held , former Head of Marketing at Kraken. Held highlighted Schiff‚Äôs shifting stance on Bitcoin, noting that Schiff had initially claimed Bitcoin would never succeed, then admitted it had succeeded somewhat but would eventually fail, and now argues it poses a major threat to the U.S. government. Schiff‚Äôs concerns are directly tied to ongoing proposals led by Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis and the incoming Trump administration. In July 2024, Senator Lummis first introduced the Bitcoin Act , which proposed that the U.S. Treasury acquire one million Bitcoin over time. The goal was to hold approximately 5% of the total Bitcoin supply, intending to establish a government-backed Bitcoin reserve similar in scope to the country‚Äôs gold reserves. With Trump‚Äôs return to office as the 47th president of the U.S., Lummis‚Äôs proposal gains new momentum. Trump has supported a Bitcoin reserve, having outlined his vision at a Bitcoin conference in Nashville in July 2024. JUST IN ‚Äì Trump, if President, pledges to form a Bitcoin Reserve, using 210,000 Bitcoin seized by the Department of Justice, as the core of a new ‚ÄúStrategic National Bitcoin Stockpile.‚Äù pic.twitter.com/ucvlyP3BDx ‚Äî Disclose.tv (@disclosetv) July 27, 2024 He suggested that such a reserve would reinforce the nation‚Äôs financial stability and increase its influence within the global financial system. This growing support for a federal Bitcoin reserve has stirred debate, particularly among experts and analysts. Michael Saylor, the co-founder of MicroStrategy, has even suggested the U.S. should abandon gold entirely in favor of Bitcoin. MICHAEL SAYLOR: Dump all US gold for 5M #Bitcoin ‚Äîthe trade is free. Demontize enemy gold reserves to zero while we take control of the World's Reserve Capital Network pic.twitter.com/XpWhVtKeuF ‚Äî Swan (@Swan) December 7, 2024 This idea has sparked strong reactions, with former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers criticizing the proposal as unrealistic . William Dudley, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, also warned that creating a federal Bitcoin reserve could cause BTC price to surge . This would benefit current Bitcoin holders but potentially destabilize the broader economy. Could a Bitcoin Reserve Solve the $36 Trillion U.S. National Debt? According to the U.S. debt tracking website , the national debt has now reached $36 trillion, equating to $107,000 per citizen. Crypto enthusiasts suggest that creating a Bitcoin reserve could offer a way out by leveraging Bitcoin‚Äôs growing value. Bitcoin recently surged to an all-time high of over $103,000 on December 5, 2024, drawing attention to its potential as a financial asset. While its price has since stabilized around $98,000, experts believe that factors such as favorable crypto regulations, increased adoption, and the establishment of Bitcoin reserves by various nations will continue to drive its value upwards. If the price of Bitcoin continues to rise, countries that implement Bitcoin reserves could benefit substantially from its appreciation, with the U.S. using the gains to offset its enormous national debt. MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm, is already demonstrating how Bitcoin can be used for financial growth. The company began purchasing Bitcoin in 2020 and now holds over 423,650 BTC after purchasing 21,550 BTC for about $2.1 billion , yielding a 68.7% return so far this year. With Bitcoin‚Äôs increasing prominence, this concept is gaining momentum as a potential game-changer in global finance.

37427509,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374021,1733760349,Bhutan‚Äôs Government Transfers $40M in Bitcoin to QCP Capital,"According to blockchain analytics platform SpotOnChain, on December 9, the Royal Government of Bhutan transferred 402 Bitcoin (BTC) worth $39.56 million to QCP Capital. This is the latest in a series of transactions from Bhutan‚Äôs government, which has been actively selling its Bitcoin reserves since October. Previous Transfers and Current Reserves SpotOnChain data shows that the wallet has moved 1,696 BTC, valued at $139 million, since Bitcoin‚Äôs price surge in late October. These sales, carried out through Binance and QCP Capital, were made at an average price of $81,999 per BTC. While the government has not disclosed the reasons behind these transactions, deposits to cryptocurrency exchanges are often associated with intentions to sell. This marks the third major Bitcoin transfer by Bhutan‚Äôs government this year. In October, it sent 929 BTC, valued at $66.16 million, to Binance across two transactions. These occurred shortly after the cryptocurrency surpassed $70,000 for the first time since June. Earlier in July, Arkham data revealed that the government-linked wallet deposited 381 BTC worth $24.1 million at the time to Kraken. Bhutan holds approximately 11,700 BTC valued at $1.15 billion across seven known wallets, making it the fourth-largest government Bitcoin holder globally. The coins are managed by Druk Holding & Investments (DHI), the country‚Äôs state investment arm. Bitcoin‚Äôs Role in Bhutan‚Äôs Economy Unlike many countries that acquire Bitcoin through criminal asset seizures, Bhutan has built its reserves through mining operations powered by its abundant hydroelectric resources. Officials recently confirmed that mining in the country began in April 2019, when Bitcoin was priced at around $5,000. The reserves have since grown to account for 26.9% of Bhutan‚Äôs $2.9 billion GDP in 2023, as reported by the World Bank. In May 2023, DHI partnered with Bitdeer Technologies Group to launch a $500 million fund to boost Bitcoin mining in the country. In April 2024, Bhutan announced plans to expand its mining capacity by 500 megawatts by mid-2025, bringing the total capacity to 600 megawatts. In addition to its mining activities, Bhutan has explored innovations in digital finance. In 2021, the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA) partnered with Ripple to develop a digital version of its national currency. At the time, the nation‚Äôs central bank said the initiative aimed to enhance digital and cross-border payments and promote financial inclusion.

37428696,https://invezz.com/?p=2379866,1733760299,El Salvador considers Bitcoin law changes to secure $1.3 billion IMF loan,"El Salvador, the pioneering country that introduced Bitcoin legal tender, is proposing major changes to its Bitcoin legislation. This perspective shift occurs as the government seeks a pivotal agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a $1.3 billion loan. The revisions would allow El Salvador to address the IMF‚Äôs ongoing worries about the financial ramifications of its cryptocurrency effort, which was started in September 2021. The context for El Salvador‚Äôs Bitcoin Journey El Salvador made headlines in 2021 when it adopted Bitcoin as a legal currency, a historic step aimed at increasing financial inclusion and stimulating economic growth. President Nayib Bukele has positioned the country as a model for cryptocurrency adoption, gaining worldwide interest and investment. However, this ambitious initiative has not been without controversy and problems. Critics have highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility and potential economic concerns, especially in a country already plagued by high poverty and weak financial infrastructure. Loan Proposal and its Implications According to reports by Cointelegraph , El Salvador is close to negotiating a $1.3 billion loan deal with the IMF, with conversations ongoing since October. Also, according to the Financial Times, if the agreement is ratified, it will need considerable changes to current Bitcoin laws. One of the most significant changes would be the removal of the statutory obligation for businesses to accept Bitcoin as payment. Instead, the cryptocurrency would shift to a voluntary payment option, relieving some of the immediate economic strains on local firms. By implementing this approach, the Salvadoran government wants to secure an additional $2 billion in funding from foreign financial organizations, particularly the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. These funds could provide critical help to the country‚Äôs economy, which has been hampered by factors such as the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent economic slowdowns. IMF‚Äôs Concerns The IMF has continually expressed reservations about El Salvador‚Äôs Bitcoin proposal, expressing concerns about financial stability and the possible hazards of incorporating a highly volatile digital asset into the national economy. The organization‚Äôs perspective emphasizes the delicate balance that states must strike when contemplating alternative currencies within established financial systems. The IMF has previously warned that Bitcoin price volatility may expose the government to serious financial risks. This stance reflects the global community‚Äôs concern regarding the viability of cryptocurrencies as a stabilization tool in emerging markets. Possible outcomes: financial stability and international support As negotiations with the IMF advance, changes to the Bitcoin law may stabilize El Salvador‚Äôs economy while also improving relations with international financial partners. The reworking of its Bitcoin strategy may represent a strategic shift from aggressive cryptocurrency adoption to a more careful and sustainable approach. This would allow El Salvador to align its economic goals with global expectations while also capitalizing on the potential benefits of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. The financing agreement is scheduled to be finalized within the next several weeks, which creates a sense of urgency for both the Salvadoran administration and citizens. The conclusion of these negotiations will most certainly have an impact not just on the country‚Äôs current economic health, but also on its long-term financial stability and credibility with international investors. Is El Salvador at a crossroads? El Salvador‚Äôs changing approach to Bitcoin and international financing marks an important milestone in the country‚Äôs economic development. The country is at a crossroads as it strives to receive an important IMF loan while also addressing local and global worries over cryptocurrency. The decisions taken in the next weeks may shape its financial future and impact how other governments view cryptocurrency‚Äôs role in their economies. El Salvador‚Äôs capacity to handle the intricate interplay of innovation and stability will determine whether or not it emerges victorious from this watershed moment.

Increased buying from major whales is often viewed as a sign that ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù sees value in an asset, and that its risk reward is good. So, as the XRP price consolidates within recent ranges, could it be setting up for its next major surge? XRP Price Targets $5 Per analysis of the shorter time-frame charts from popular technical analyst CryptoinsightUK , another surge in the XRP could be coming shortly. When $XRP last had a range based correction, the 0.5-0.618 acted as key resistance; Once we broke this level, we hit a full 4.236 extension in 3 days and 17 hours; We are currently fighting these levels again; A repeat would put is at $5.26 by December 11th if we break today;‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/3RKkVr45Ly ‚Äî Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) December 7, 2024 CryptoinsightsUK looks at the example of the late-November price correction, where the XRP price fell back from highs of around $1.60 to lows of around $1.20. He notes that the XRP price rallied all the way beyond the 4.236 Fibonacci extension level and retraced upwards from $1.20 to $1.60. If history were to repeat, XRP could surge to $5.26 by the 11th of December. That would mean new all-time highs for the cryptocurrency and a market cap of nearly $300 billion. XRP has been one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in the space since Donald Trump‚Äôs US presidential election victory just over one month ago, and since the pro-crypto Republican Party took majorities in both the US House and Senate. The XRP price has suffered badly as a result of a major SEC lawsuit in recent years. But the incoming Trump administration and congressional session looks set to usher in a new golden age for the US crypto industry, with XRP likely to be one of the biggest winners. Elsewhere, XRP recently cut its reserve requirements to allow transactions from wallets holding lower XRP amounts, widening the accessibility of the XRP Ledger. All said, there is plenty of ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù backing the XRP price‚Äôs recent move higher, which has seen it roughly 5x since the start of November. So how high could the XRP price go? How High Can XRP Go? With Ethereum (ETH) testing $4,000, Bitcoin (BTC) dominance breaking down in a major way for the first time since early 2021, various indices, including from blockchaincenter.net , have confirmed the return of altcoin season. If we are at the beginning of a new alt-coin surge, XRP price risks remain tilted strongly to the upside. In a separate update on X, ali_charts argued against the idea that XRP is overbought at current levels. He instead pointed to the fact that XRP has broken out of a multi-year symmetrical triangle. His conservative target is for a near-4x rally all the way up to $8.40, but potentially as high as $48. To some, $XRP looks overbought! To me, it looks undervalued after breaking out of this massive multi-year symmetrical triangle. Conservative target = $8.40 Optimistic target = $48.12 pic.twitter.com/5dDMcD2jGC ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) December 8, 2024 A rally that high would mark a stunning 100x return for XRP from its pre-US election levels.

37427400,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=659435,1733760056,Bitcoin Is ‚ÄòHighly Likely‚Äô In A Supercycle: Expert Explains Why,"Renowned macro analyst Alex Kr√ºger posits that Bitcoin is ‚Äúhighly likely‚Äù in a supercycle. Kr√ºger articulated his perspective via X, emphasizing the distinct trajectory Bitcoin is currently undertaking compared to previous market cycles. A Bitcoin supercycle is a theoretical phase wherein Bitcoin‚Äôs price is anticipated to ascend extraordinarily, surpassing its traditional boom-and-bust cycles. This concept implies a prolonged period of growth fueled by increased mainstream adoption, leading to a significantly stronger and more enduring upward trajectory than the typical four-year halving cycle that Bitcoin historically follows. Is Bitcoin In A Supercycle? With regard to President-elect Donald Trump‚Äòs pro-Bitcoin U-turn and his plan to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, Kr√ºger remarked: ‚ÄúDo yourself a favor and stop comparing this cycle to prior cycles. Bitcoin is highly likely in a supercycle. The crypto industry has just experienced its most dramatic change in history, a fundamentally driven 180 degree turn,‚Äù the analyst stated. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears $100,000: Market Expert Predicts $200K Surge Amid Retail FOMO And Volatility Kr√ºger also referred to the rapid evolution of the Bitcoin and crypto sector, noting that it transitioned ‚Äúfrom a barely legal pariah detested by the state, to one of the top industries embraced by the state‚Äù within weeks‚Äîa change he describes as ‚Äúso extreme it‚Äôs hard to find comparables in modern times.‚Äù Drawing parallels to historical financial shifts, Kr√ºger highlighted the transformative impact of the 1970s on gold. ‚ÄúMaybe gold in the 1970s is one. The 1970s was a transformative decade for gold. Nixon‚Äôs ending of the Gold Standard in 1971, dismantling Bretton Woods, sent gold surging from $35 per ounce to $850 in 1981,‚Äù he explained. Kr√ºger also addressed the timing of Bitcoin‚Äôs potential peak, suggesting that expecting a major local top around March is reasonable based on his previous analyses. ‚ÄúThis would be heavily dependent on the slope of ascent, funding rates, and the broader economy. But one should not equate a major local top with the beginning of the bear market,‚Äù he noted. While acknowledging the possibility of a bear market, he emphasized that ‚Äúthe conditions for it are not yet there. It‚Äôs also too soon to be expecting a top. Bitcoin bull-runs always last for many months. It‚Äôs only been 33 days since Trump unleashed the Kraken.‚Äù Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally To Continue If This Level Holds, Is $110,000 The Next Stop? Highlighting the precarious nature of market sentiment, Kr√ºger added a cautionary note: ‚ÄúThe moment you all finally believe what I just wrote, then it will [be] the top.‚Äù With this statement Kr√ºger underscores the psychological factors that often influences market dynamics, particularly the collective belief in market peaks. X user Paradox Parrot (@Paradoxparrot) commented on Kr√ºger‚Äôs assertion, stating, ‚ÄúAgree. But, ‚Äòthis time is different‚Äô is a good way to round trip back down.‚Äù In response, Kr√ºger acknowledged the cyclical skepticism surrounding altcoins, asserting, ‚ÄúSure. Alts will round trip most of it. It‚Äôs the nature of the beast. Mind this time has already been proven different multiple times at many levels. I‚Äôve anticipated and covered that here in detail since mid 2023. Btw alts round trip for 2 reasons. A) lack of fundamentally driven demand. And more importantly B) illiquidity (that‚Äôs also why they go up in such a vertical manner).‚Äù Despite Kr√ºger‚Äôs optimistic outlook, not all experts concur with the supercycle hypothesis. Chris Burnsike, partner at Placeholder VC, offered a contrasting view on X on December 7: ‚ÄúBookmark it for later: a supercycle is never real ‚Äì everything is cyclical, though cycles can vary. Buying into the idea of a supercycle is how you never sell and roundtrip. Ask anyone who never sold in 2021.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $98,287.

37427374,https://crypto.news/?p=14317677,1733760006,BIT Mining expands with new operations in Ethiopia,"BIT Mining, a cryptocurrency mining firm listed on the New York Stock Exchange, has announced steps to expand its mining operations with new acquisitions in Ethiopia. The company revealed on Dec. 9 that it had completed the first phase of its plan to acquire data centers and Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining equipment in Ethiopia. In its initial announcement, BIT Mining said it planned to acquire up to $14.2 million worth of data centers and BTC mining machines. The deal will see the miner get an additional 51-megawatt in data centers as well as 17,869 Bitcoin mining machines. The first phase of the deal is done, BIT wrote . The cash-and-stock transaction included $2.265 million in cash and 369,031,800 Class A ordinary shares to acquire a 35 MW crypto mining data center. BIT Mining also added 17,869 Bitcoin mining machines to its operations. The next phase of the expansion is expected to conclude in March or April 2025, focusing on acquiring the remaining data centers. The deal should finalize with the new data centers operational by late Q1 or early Q2 2025. If successful, the company plans to issue up to 45,278,600 BTCM shares to fund the expansion. Read more: Ethiopian Bitcoin mining gets 600MW boost as country signals support for industry Earlier this month, BIT Mining announced that it would continue to merge mine Litecoin ( LTC ) and Dogecoin ( DOGE ). The company attributed this to the huge profits that the firm netted from self-mining both LTC and DOGE in the past year. As of November 27, 2024, BIT had mined a total of 84,485.42 LTC and 227,908,250.38 DOGE. ‚ÄúThe recent rally in Litecoin and Dogecoin, fueled in part by Elon Musk‚Äôs influence and the changing regulatory landscape in the US after the Trump win, has had a major impact on mining profitability,‚Äù Dr. Youwei Yang, BIT Mining‚Äôs chief economist and vice president of mining, said in a statement. LTC and DOGE prices have surged 73% and 117%, respectively, in the past 30 days. Bitcoin, which recently surpassed $100,000, gained 31% during the same period and has risen 126% over the past year.

37437394,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51768,1733760004,"Bitcoin Rally Sparks Wall Street FOMO as Traders Spot a Secret Altcoin Ready for a 22,104% Breakout","The recent Bitcoin rally toward the $100,000 mark has sparked Wall Street FOMO among traders, driving them to seek opportunities in altcoins. A secret altcoin stands out as a hidden gem, with projections suggesting a 22,104% breakout. As Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance continues to rise, its influence on the broader market could trigger significant gains for undervalued altcoins like PCHAIN. This presents a low-risk, high-reward opportunity for investors looking for growth beyond Bitcoin‚Äôs established trajectory. Why the Bitcoin Rally is Pushing this Undervalued Altcoin, PCHAIN, into the Spotlight The recent surge in the Bitcoin price , currently trading at $101,962, has been driven by several key factors, including institutional adoption and macroeconomic trends, such as the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. Major players like BlackRock, MicroStrategy, and Fidelity have contributed to Bitcoin‚Äôs growing legitimacy as a financial asset.‚Äã Historically, as Bitcoin hits new highs, altcoins often follow suit, riding the wave of increased market activity‚Äã. Bitcoin‚Äôs current price trend and its impact on altcoins highlight the cyclical nature of the crypto market, where significant price movements in Bitcoin often signal opportunities for other undervalued tokens to rise. The Fundamentals Behind PCHAIN‚Äôs 22,104% Breakout The Bitcoin rally plays a significant role in propelling this undervalued altcoin toward its projected 22,104% surge, but several crucial factors further contribute to this potential price explosion. PCHAIN , an RWA (Real-World Asset) token, is backed by the massive $300 trillion real estate sector. As the utility token for PropiChain, an innovative real estate blockchain platform, PCHAIN offers investors a chance to access the industry‚Äôs future. With RWA tokenization expected to reach $16 trillion and real estate being the largest asset class to undergo tokenization, PCHAIN benefits from this substantial market growth. PropiChain, PCHAIN‚Äôs parent project, is on track to leverage revolutionary real estate technologies. With plans to capture 1% of the market, PropiChain aims to build a $6 trillion ecosystem. Should this succeed, PCHAIN will become the primary utility token of this vast space, potentially causing its value to surge dramatically. The recent Bitcoin rally has sparked renewed interest in undervalued altcoins like PCHAIN. This momentum creates a perfect storm for PCHAIN, positioning it for substantial growth as Bitcoin‚Äôs influence ripples through the market. The Bitcoin Rally‚Äôs Ripple Effect: Why PCHAIN is the Altcoin to Watch PropiChain uses RWA tokenomics to transform the real estate investment landscape. By integrating metaverse, the platform eliminates the need for physical site visits, allowing investors to explore properties virtually in an interactive digital environment. Smart contracts streamline operations like lease management, automating traditional tasks like rent collection, reducing intermediaries, and cutting operational costs. Artificial intelligence further enhances the platform with personalized virtual assistants and chatbots that provide real-time support. At the same time, AI-powered market analysis tools identify emerging opportunities, giving investors a strategic advantage. PropiChain converts real estate into digital tokens through RWA tokenization, enabling fractional ownership. This innovation lowers financial barriers, making property investment accessible to a broader audience. Why PropiChain Could Be the Next Big Player in the Crypto Market Anticipated is a potential 22,104% breakout for PCHAIN as the Bitcoin rally gains traction. At its current presale price of $0.004, a $1,000 investment could yield a remarkable $222,040 return. Joining the presale now is crucial, as prices will rise to $0.011 and $0.034 in subsequent rounds. PCHAIN‚Äôs credibility is supported by an audit from BlockAudit , a globally trusted blockchain security firm that confirmed its smart contract has no vulnerabilities. The project‚Äôs listing on CoinMarketCap also confirms its commitment to innovation and long-term success in crypto. This is your ideal time to invest in this altcoin before the presale runs out.

37427870,https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-etf-performance-comparison,1733760000,Some bitcoin ETFs are doing better than others,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . It goes without saying: What‚Äôs good for bitcoin is good for bitcoin ETFs. No surprise then that almost $10 billion net has now flowed into US-listed spot funds since Trump‚Äôs win ‚Äî about 83% going to BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT. Some ETFs are still doing better than others. To be clear: Share prices for the ETFs, by design, closely track the price of bitcoin. But share prices don‚Äôt reflect whether the funds themselves are up or down on their bitcoin purchases to date. Blue is IBIT, orange is GBTC. Notice that flows relaxed when bitcoin‚Äôs price trended sideways Every stock market trading day, the funds must spend the cash flowing into them on an equivalent amount of BTC. And vice versa: They must offload coins when net flows are negative. So, it‚Äôs possible to calculate an estimate for how much BTC each fund buys and sells per day, by dividing the daily US dollar flow figures by the price of bitcoin (per CF Benchmark reference rate , which all the major funds use). Tally those BTC-denominated flows together and you get their cumulative current holdings: over 855,000 BTC ($84.2 billion), not counting Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC and BTC, and more than 1.1 million BTC ($108.3 billion) when included. That‚Äôs about 5.6% of the circulating supply. But what we‚Äôre after is the value of each fund‚Äôs BTC stash compared to how much they paid for all those coins, what I‚Äôve called relative value on the chart below. It turns out that Invesco-Galaxy‚Äôs BTCO is far ahead of the rest of the pack ‚Äî it has acquired around 8,740 BTC net for $418.9 million so far. As of this morning, BTCO‚Äôs bitcoin would fetch $860.6 million, putting its shareholder collective ahead by more than 100%. As you can see on the next chart, three-quarters of BTCO‚Äôs net flows to date came in the first two weeks of live trading, when bitcoin was changing hands for under $43,000. BTCO‚Äôs average estimated purchase price per coin: $47,930. Compare that to BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT. It has maintained more steady flows over the past 11 months ‚Äî acquiring roughly 523,935 BTC from $34.4 billion net flows. That means the ETF has effectively dollar-cost averaged its bitcoin stash to date, giving it an average coin price of $65,600. IBIT is about 50% ahead on its BTC purchases to date and has timed the market worse than any other fund in the cohort. Of course, IBIT‚Äôs BTC has appreciated much more than BTCO‚Äôs in raw dollar terms, on account of the sheer size of the fund by comparison. Still, hats off to BTCO‚Äôs contributors.

Deathstroke‚Äôs inclusion marks the end of the game‚Äôs underperforming roadmap in 2024. Struggles in development resulted in Warner Bros recording massive losses from the project. ‚ÄòSuicide Squad: Kill the Justice League‚Äô was developed by Rocksteady Studios and released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S in January 2024. The action-adventure game was created to follow the four Batman: Arkham series games. However, despite having ample financial backing and a clear roadmap, the game has continued to perform underwhelmingly, repeatedly failing to meet expectations. Deathstroke debuts in ‚ÄòSuicide Squad: Kill the Justice League‚Äô Deathstroke will be the next playable character in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, launching on December 10. #SuicideSquadGame pic.twitter.com/8O0u98jVGs ‚Äî Batman Arkham Videos (@ArkhamVideos) December 6, 2024 Rocksteady Studios announced Deathsroke‚Äôs inclusion in the game‚Äôs fourth season. The iconic masked villain will be part of the final announced season that kicks off on December 10th, with more content expected to follow. The unveiling of Deathstroke‚Äôs new design has sparked significant interest among gamers, intensifying anticipation for the upcoming season‚Äôs launch. However, Rocksteady‚Äôs announcement didn‚Äôt feature any precise details about Deathstroke‚Äôs new role. Fans expect more details to follow soon. Deathstroke‚Äôs inclusion brings a close to RockSteady‚Äôs 2024 roadmap that was revealed in January. At the time, Rocksteady announced season 1, adding the Joker as a playable character and more game content. The game‚Äôs marketing materials also promised the inclusion of three new playable characters, three new playable environments, themed gear sets, more weapons, more activities, mid-season updates, and more content in seasons 2, 3, and 4. The game studio delivered on its promise, with the content milestones all being achieved despite struggling through its development. While the roadmap announcement triggered gamer intrigue, the game fell short of gamers‚Äô and publishers‚Äô expectations. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League‚Äôs release earned subpar reviews, with gamers giving it mixed reviews on Steam. Season 2 and Season 3 also struggled to resonate with gamers despite including iconic characters such as Dr. Freeze and Gunhawk. Consequently, Rocksteady faced substantial criticism as the studio sought to reignite player interest through a series of post-launch updates and adjustments. Rocksteady faces challenges as final season launches ‚ÄòSuicide Squad: Kill the Justice League‚Äô has been underwhelming despite building up gamer anticipation before it was released. The game‚Äôs struggles extended to its publisher, Warner Bros, which said it had lost $200 million in revenue. The loss was one of many disappointing outcomes that affected the game‚Äôs development and, more so, its decisions around its development direction. After launching the game in a live-service format, the developers struggled to match gamers‚Äô expectations. A fan said : ‚ÄúTook you way too long to add your best character. Haven‚Äôt even thought about this game since The Joker was added. Maybe I‚Äôll give it a try for Deathstroke.‚Äù ‚Äì BucklandBrad However, with Deathstroke, a fan-favorite character, making his entry, gamers‚Äô expectations have been raised. Fans of the series have stated that they were eagerly waiting for the season to kick off. Some discussed the game‚Äôs previous setbacks, with many stating that they would have been avoided if the developers had included characters that gamers were interested in. With some gamers opting to be skeptical about the fourth season, others speculated that it might be Rocksteady‚Äôs final chance to change the game‚Äôs dwindling fortunes.

Just a day after appointing crypto advocate Paul Atkins on Dec. 4 to lead the SEC in 2025, Trump introduced a new face on Dec. 5 to shape his administration‚Äôs AI and crypto strategies: David Sacks. I am pleased to announce that David O.

In November, Trump unveiled a new advisory board, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Co-led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, this board is tasked with streamlining government operations. The name, a clear nod to the meme-inspired crypto Dogecoin ( DOGE ), has already sparked speculation about Trump‚Äôs administration embracing digital currencies. As a result, Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged past $100,000 shortly after the Atkins announcement on Dec. 5, reaching an all-time high of $103,900 before settling around $99,000 as of Dec. 9. In a Truth Social post announcing Sacks‚Äô appointment, Trump praised him as a person of ‚Äúbusiness experience, intelligence, and pragmatism.‚Äù Sacks is now tasked with tackling critical challenges in both AI and crypto. I am pleased to announce that David O. Sacks will be the ‚ÄúWhite House A.I. & Crypto Czar.‚Äù In this important role, David will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness. David‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Donald J. Trump Posts From His Truth Social (@TrumpDailyPosts) December 6, 2024 These tasks include establishing a legal framework to enable crypto businesses to flourish and addressing what Trump has described as ‚ÄúBig Tech bias and censorship.‚Äù So, who is David Sacks, and what does this appointment really mean for the future of crypto and AI in America? Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the man behind the title, his responsibilities, and the broader reactions from the crypto world Who is David Sacks? David Sacks is far more than a Silicon Valley entrepreneur. His journey through tech, venture capital, and thought leadership has made him one of the most prominent voices in innovation today. Born in South Africa and educated at Stanford University and the University of Chicago Law School, Sacks first gained recognition as the Chief Operating Officer of PayPal during its formative years. This experience not only defined his career but also positioned him within the influential ‚ÄúPayPal Mafia,‚Äù a group of early PayPal executives who went on to build groundbreaking companies. Fellow members include Elon Musk, a vocal proponent of crypto, and Peter Thiel, one of Bitcoin‚Äôs earliest supporters. After PayPal‚Äôs sale to eBay in 2002, Sacks turned his focus to entrepreneurship. In 2008, he founded Yammer, an enterprise-focused social network similar to ‚ÄúFacebook for businesses.‚Äù Four years later, Microsoft acquired Yammer for $1.2 billion, cementing Sacks‚Äô reputation as someone who could build and scale tech ventures to global success. He didn‚Äôt even stop there ‚Äî he founded Craft Ventures, a San Francisco-based venture capital firm known for backing disruptive startups. Moreover, Sacks‚Äô connection to the crypto world isn‚Äôt recent. As early as 2017, he was advocating for the huge potential of Bitcoin, calling it the cornerstone of a ‚Äúdecentralized web‚Äù or the ‚Äúinternet of money.‚Äù Sacks‚Äô perspective aligns with the ethos of the crypto community and sheds light on why Trump, who has pivoted to a pro-crypto stance in recent years, sees Sacks as a natural fit for guiding policy in this domain. Another unique aspect of Sacks‚Äô profile is his role as a co-host of the All-In Podcast . The podcast, co-hosted with Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis, and David Friedberg, covers a mix of economics, technology, and politics, often with a focus on crypto and blockchain. Palihapitiya, for instance, has been a vocal advocate for Bitcoin, famously predicting its value to rise to millions in the coming decades. Jason Calacanis has similarly shown interest in decentralized technologies, often discussing their disruptive potential. Beyond the podcast, Sacks has remained closely aligned with key figures in the tech world, including Musk. He even played a key role in Musk‚Äôs acquisition of Twitter (now X). His influence extends to venture capital as well. Under Craft Ventures, Sacks has backed several startups operating in the blockchain and decentralized finance space, hinting at a strategic belief in crypto‚Äôs potential in global finance. For a crypto industry long plagued by regulatory uncertainty, his appointment offers a glimmer of hope for clearer, more forward-looking policies. Industry voices on Sacks‚Äô appointment Sacks‚Äô new role as the White House A.I. & Crypto Czar has drawn reactions from some of the biggest names in tech and crypto, and those who know Sacks, either personally or through his work, are optimistic about what he brings to the table. Musk, who has worked closely with Sacks on several ventures, kept his message simple: ‚ÄúIndeed, congratulations, David!‚Äù ‚Äî giving a subtle nod to each word from Trump‚Äôs Truth Social post. Indeed, congratulations David! ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 6, 2024 Their long-standing partnership, including Musk‚Äôs leadership in the newly established DOGE advisory board, hints at a potential synergy between private-sector innovation and government policy under Sacks‚Äô guidance Tyler Winklevoss, an early Bitcoin investor and co-founder of Gemini , framed Sacks‚Äô appointment as a win for pro-business and pro-crypto policies. ‚ÄúDavid‚Äôs a multiple-time tech founder with huge successes,‚Äù Winklevoss noted. https://twitter.com/tyler/status/1864847390760484921 He pointed out that Sacks is someone who ‚Äúwas super early in crypto‚Äù and understands what it takes to build meaningful policies that support business and innovation, calling the decision a bullish move for the U.S. economy. Palihapitiya, Sacks‚Äô co-host on the All-In Podcast, said, ‚ÄúDavid Sacks is the very best of America‚Äîa successful entrepreneur, a principled free speech absolutist, and a brilliant technologist.‚Äù David Sacks is the very best of America ‚Äì a successful entrepreneur, a principled free speech absolutist and a brilliant technologist.

For those in the industry like Jeremy Allaire, CEO of USDC ‚Äôs issuer Circle, this appointment seems like a validation of crypto and AI‚Äôs role in shaping the future. Allaire noted that Trump‚Äôs decision shows a recognition that these technologies are critical for maintaining the U.S.‚Äô edge in the global innovation race.

Well done. ‚Äî Jeremy Allaire ‚Äì jda.eth / jdallaire.sol (@jerallaire) December 6, 2024 Allaire‚Äôs optimism was echoed by Ripple‚Äôs ( XRP ) CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who believes Sacks will play a key role in driving ‚Äúpro-innovation plans‚Äù forward, especially in providing clarity to the regulatory chaos that has frustrated crypto firms for years. Huge congrats to @DavidSacks on this appointment ‚Äì he understands tech inside and out, and importantly, will push forward President Trump‚Äôs crypto and AI pro-innovation plans. Dream team! https://t.co/FFMSCIiscl ‚Äî Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 6, 2024 A pro-crypto administration: What the future holds? For years, regulatory uncertainty has plagued the U.S. crypto industry. Under the current SEC chair, Gary Gensler, the agency‚Äôs approach has been widely criticized as overly aggressive, with enforcement actions taking precedence over clear guidelines. With the appointment of Sacks as the White House A.I. & Crypto Czar and Atkins set to replace Gensler as SEC chair, the stage seems set for a significant policy overhaul. Atkins has been a known advocate for lighter regulatory frameworks, and he will step into his role as the SEC chief in January 2025. Back in 2018, Atkin argued that excessive red tape could stifle innovation in the blockchain sector. His appointment represents a major win for the crypto industry, which has struggled with ambiguous rules around whether tokens are securities or commodities. Musk‚Äôs involvement adds another layer of momentum. Musk has been a vocal supporter of crypto, famously enabling Tesla to accept Bitcoin payments briefly and often using his social media influence to drive interest in Dogecoin. Topping it all, Sacks‚Äô mandate to create a clear legal framework for the crypto industry could finally address the patchwork of inconsistent rules that have left many businesses either in limbo or relocating to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions like Dubai and Singapore. If these appointments signal anything, it‚Äôs this: the future of America‚Äôs crypto industry is no longer a question of if but how far it can go.

Although Gala was on an uptrend last week, it is now facing a minor short-term correction before continuing its bullish momentum. Meanwhile, Rollblock is revolutionizing the GambleFi market with its new crypto native project that is poised for 880% gains before the end of its viral presale. Decentraland (MANA) Records Significant Capital Inflows During Whale Accumulation Decentraland‚Äôs price has been trading sideways since its peak in 2021 because of low investor interest in the GameFi space. Despite losing investors over the last three years, Decentraland recorded an impressive 188.09% surge during the post-election rally. Even when the broader crypto market faced a correction, Decentraland showed resilience and maintained its uptrend. Decentraland is currently trading for $0.6774 after an intraday dip of around 8%. Decentraland‚Äôs volume has also decreased by 1.19% during the same period which is likely caused by a minor retracement after last week‚Äôs rally. Since Decentraland‚Äôs technical indicators are still showing bullish strength, analysts believe Decentraland could attract more investors before the end of Q4‚Äôs altseason. If these bullish predictions stand true, Decentraland‚Äôs price could target the $1.08 and $1.61 levels soon. Gala (GALA) Experiences Short-term Correction After Massive Rally Gala‚Äôs price has jumped by 221.69% during the last 30 days as traders regain interest in the Web3 gaming space. Since Gala recently broke out of a falling wedge pattern on its weekly chart, analysts believe Gala is on its way to record a new all time high price before the end of Q4. Gala also retested the upper trendline which typically suggests strong bullish momentum. Gala is currently trading for $0.06149 after an intraday decline of 1.68%. Gala‚Äôs trading volume has increased by 11.53% during the same period which suggests some selling activity from short holders. Since Gala‚Äôs RSI has already recovered and the MACD indicator is suggesting another uptrend, analysts believe Gala‚Äôs price will target the $0.06565 and $0.09536 levels soon. Rollblock (RBLK) Brings Whales Back to DeFi Gaming with Web3 GambleFi Project Rollblock is bringing significant whale investments to the world of DeFi gaming by launching a new GambleFi project.

Dogecoin‚Äôs rise: From meme to major cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) launched in 2013 as a light-hearted alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies, using a Shiba Inu meme for its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, it has no maximum supply and produces 10,000 new coins every minute. Initially considered a memecoin, it surged in value in 2021, entering the top ten cryptocurrencies with a market cap exceeding $50 billion. This surge was fueled by social media influence, notably from Elon Musk. Created as a joke by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, Dogecoin gained popularity, highlighting the impact of community and social media on financial markets. Its potential lies in its active community and widespread recognition. In the current market cycle, its attractiveness depends on social media engagement and market trends. Conclusion DOGE and other coins show less short-term potential. DOGEN, designed for those seeking luxury and success, is set for 700% growth by presale‚Äôs end, with possible thousand-fold returns this altcoin season.

He noted that cryptocurrencies fall under the jurisdiction of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), which is actively developing a regulatory framework. Iran‚Äôs Vision for Crypto Regulation According to local reports , Hemmati highlighted the government‚Äôs goal of eliminating the negative impacts of cryptocurrencies on the economy while maximizing their potential benefits.

The framework prioritizes compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) laws, counter-terrorism financing (CTF) measures, and local tax regulations. CBI Governor Mohammadreza Farzin underscored the importance of collaboration between the CBI and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to create robust policies for the digital asset ecosystem. Farzin echoed Hemmati‚Äôs sentiments, citing cryptocurrencies as tools to boost national assets, align with global economic practices, and evade sanctions. Economist Mohammad Sadegh Alhosseini estimates that Iranian investors currently hold $30 billion to $50 billion in cryptocurrency. This is comparable to one-third of the nation‚Äôs gold market. This underscores the growing importance of digital assets in Iran‚Äôs economy. Iran CBDC Plans Amid Regional and Global Implications Beyond cryptocurrencies, Iran has made strides in developing central bank digital currency (CBDC). A report shows that 134 countries are exploring digital currency . The digital rial, which has been in development since 2018, is part of Iran‚Äôs efforts to modernize its financial systems. The digital currency utilizes open-source Hyperledger Fabric technology and has undergone extensive research and testing. This includes a retail CBDC pilot launched on the island of Kish, a free trade zone. The pilot aims to evaluate the currency‚Äôs domestic use and scalability for future implementation. In June, CBI Governor Farzin remarked that the CBDC initiative is critical to Iran‚Äôs plan to maintain modern banking practices while addressing domestic economic challenges.

This strategy marks a notable shift in how governments under economic constraints leverage blockchain technology to bolster their financial systems.

37426885,https://crypto.news/?p=14317670,1733758849,Economist explains why crypto and stock prices may crash in 2025,"Crypto and stock prices have surged this year, driven by strong earnings and central banks lowering interest rates. Bitcoin ( BTC ) reached a record high of nearly $105,000, while the total cryptocurrency market cap increased by 120%. U.S. stock indices like the Nasdaq 100, Dow Jones, and S&P 500 have also risen by over 20%. Analysts are optimistic about continued growth in these assets. Oppenheimer, for instance, predicted the S&P 500 to rise from its current level of around 6,070 to 7,100, citing robust fundamentals Similarly, Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, estimated that Bitcoin price could eventually reach $3 million, driven by corporate and government adoption of Bitcoin as a reserve asset.

Mark Zandi explains why crypto and stocks may crash in 2025 Mark Zandi, Chief Economist at Moody‚Äôs, cautioned that both stocks and crypto are significantly overvalued. He attributes their current stability to the absence of a major bearish catalyst. I‚Äôve argued that most asset markets appear overvalued, bordering on frothy. Stocks, corporate bonds, single family housing, crypto and gold, quickly come to mind. But what could be the catalyst for them to selloff? How about a meaningful correction in the Treasury bond market. ‚Äî Mark Zandi (@Markzandi) December 8, 2024 The catalyst, in his view, will come from the Treasuries market, which has expanded dramatically in the past few years. In the U.S., public debt has jumped to over $36.2 trillion and is growing by $1 trillion every four months. Zandi believes that the bond market will become highly volatile in 2025 as the Federal Reserve exits quantitative tightening. At the same time, China is no longer buying U.S. bonds, while Japan is starting to reduce its purchases. As such, he expects hedge funds that are buying these bonds to exit en masse when signs of problems emerge. At the same time, U.S. deficits are expected to keep rising under Trump. Therefore, Zandi expects that bond yields will soar, leading to a rotation from overvalued assets like stocks and crypto. Recent history shows that cryptocurrencies and stocks often drop when bond yields are rising. A good example is what happened in 2022 when the 10-year bond yield jumped from 1.33% to 4.3% as the Fed hiked rates to combat elevated inflation. Bitcoin crashed by 64% in that year, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones fell by 19% and 8.8%, respectively. These assets have rallied this year as bond yields fell as the Fed started cutting interest rates .

A year of achievement and promise. The gloom that started 2024 melted away at the end.   With the approval of bitcoin ETFs in January, and the re-election of Donald Trump in November, everything about the mood in crypto changed. New investors came into the market and funding flowed across categories.  Bitcoin reigned supreme, zooming through $100K in December. Bitcoin dominance was at 70%-plus. And the U.S. president-elect had promised a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, perhaps to buy the U.S. as much as 5% of total supply.  Bitcoin ETFs had the most successful launches of any in history, with $145 billion already invested. Bitcoin found a widely acknowledged role ‚Äì as digital gold ‚Äì and looks more and more like a base layer to a new financial system.  Ethereum sputtered (or so they said) with critics complaining about lengthy development roadmaps and inferior performance (compared to Solana and other new L1s). Still, ETH was up 58% (compared to bitcoin‚Äôs YTD of 120%) and 500-plus Layer-2s bloomed. Base, Optimism and Arbitrum, in particular, gained real-world traction.   Solana, with SOL up 111% YTD, hummed with memecoins and many less ephemeral projects. Telegram, now a real blockchain player, purred with tap-to-earn gaming, garnering hundreds of millions of players around the world. DePIN (or Decentralized Physical Infrastructure) took off as a category, promising real-world infrastructure (telecoms, electricity, mapping, and more) and a different form of crypto adoption. Polymarket showed that prediction markets could be better than polls, and became as relevant to crypto traders ‚Äì and everyday people ‚Äì as CNN. AI became part of everything.   Stablecoins remained the most popular form of crypto (by transaction volume) and looked ever more like a global payment layer. USDT dominated and, and, flush with profits, Tether invested in a range of non-USDT projects, hoping one day to trade legally in the U.S., too.   Crypto showed real political power, helping elect Trump and 50+ other Congressional candidates. PACs like Fairshake look well-placed for 2026.  Europe, though not as dynamic as Asia or the U.S., implemented MICA, becoming the first region with a comprehensive policy framework. Hong Kong and Singapore led the way in APAC.

37426927,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624902,1733758723,China keeps making the wrong economic decisions this year ‚Äì But here‚Äôs the bigger picture,"China is stumbling through 2024, and the numbers show it. Consumer inflation in November fell to a measly 0.2% year-on-year, the lowest in five months. Expectations weren‚Äôt high, with analysts predicting a 0.5% rise, but even that was missed. Core inflation, which leaves out volatile food and fuel prices, barely moved, ticking up to 0.3% from October‚Äôs 0.2%. Meanwhile, pork prices surged 13.7%, and fresh vegetables jumped 10%, further straining household budgets. Wholesale inflation was no better. The producer price index dropped for the 26th straight month, falling 2.5% year-on-year. This decline, slightly better than the 2.8% drop analysts expected, still signals trouble. Prices for ferrous metals plunged 7.1%, fuel and power dropped 6.5%, and chemical raw materials fell 5%. Across the board, key industries are feeling the squeeze. Stimulus efforts aren‚Äôt working China‚Äôs economy may meet its growth target of ‚Äúaround 5%,‚Äù but that‚Äôs where the good news ends. A prolonged housing slump, weak domestic spending, and worsening trade tensions with the U.S. are dragging everything else down. Since late September, Beijing has been throwing everything it can at the problem: cutting interest rates, easing property buying rules, and pumping liquidity into stock markets. The results? Minimal. Consumer price inflation remains stuck near zero, while producer price deflation deepens. The roots of these issues trace back to the country‚Äôs struggling real estate sector, which props up local government finances. Beijing announced a $1.4 trillion bailout in November to ease the debt crisis choking local administrations, but it‚Äôs like putting a Band-Aid on a bullet wound. Economists at Morgan Stanley warn the debt swap program needs to expand further. Local government financing vehicle (LGFV) debt is almost half of China‚Äôs GDP, and the current measures won‚Äôt be enough. On top of this, Beijing plans to widen its fiscal deficit by 1.4 percentage points to fund central government borrowing. By October, the fiscal deficit had already surged to 3.8%, driven by special bond issuance. Yet, by March, policymakers scaled back to a 3% target. China‚Äôs leaders are banking on ‚Äúmore proactive‚Äù fiscal policies and ‚Äúmoderately‚Äù looser monetary policies to stimulate domestic consumption. At a recent Politburo meeting, they committed to stabilizing property and stock markets while using ‚Äúunconventional counter-cyclical‚Äù measures. Trump‚Äôs return, U.S.-China trade tensions rise As if internal problems weren‚Äôt enough, China is facing another trade showdown with the United States. President Donald Trump has vowed to slap 60% tariffs on Chinese imports, a move that would gut trade between the world‚Äôs two largest economies. Beijing isn‚Äôt taking this lightly, recently restricting exports of high-tech and military-use materials. Despite the tensions, Trump claims he‚Äôs on speaking terms with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Over the weekend, Trump told NBC‚Äôs Meet the Press , ‚ÄúI had an agreement with President Xi, who I got along with very well.‚Äù However, their relationship hasn‚Äôt always been smooth. During his first term, Trump escalated the trade war and called COVID-19 the ‚ÄúChinese Virus,‚Äù souring relations further. Beijing congratulated Trump on his election win, showing a desire for ‚Äúhealthy and sustainable‚Äù relations. At the same time, Xi laid down China‚Äôs ‚Äúfour red lines‚Äù during a recent meeting with President Joe Biden, setting boundaries for any future negotiations with Trump. Financial markets are already reacting. Hong Kong‚Äôs Hang Seng Index jumped 2.8% following Monday‚Äôs economic data release. The Chinese offshore yuan strengthened slightly to 7.2776 against the U.S. dollar. However, China‚Äôs 10-year bond yields hit a record low of 1.935%. Housing and debt woes pile up China‚Äôs real estate market remains a disaster. Local governments, heavily reliant on land sales for revenue, are finding themselves in deeper financial trouble as property prices stagnate. The November $1.4 trillion bailout package is supposed to help, but Morgan Stanley analysts say it‚Äôs just a start. LGFV debt is a ticking time bomb, and expanding the debt swap program is important. The real estate crash isn‚Äôt just a housing issue, it‚Äôs hitting consumer spending hard. With fewer people buying homes, related industries like construction and retail are also taking a hit. Xi Jinping acknowledged these challenges at a recent policy meeting, calling for ‚Äúfull preparation‚Äù to meet 2025 economic targets. Meanwhile, the Central Economic Work Conference, scheduled for December 11-12, will set the stage for next year‚Äôs fiscal plans. Leaders are expected to keep the GDP growth target at ‚Äúaround 5%,‚Äù the same as this year. But given the current economic climate, even maintaining that modest goal might be a stretch. Beijing is also facing criticism over its latest tech export restrictions. The move, seen as retaliation against U.S. sanctions, could escalate the tech war between the two nations. With Trump naming China hawks to key administration posts, including ex-Senator David Perdue as U.S. ambassador to China, the road ahead looks rough.

You might also like: XYZVerse 25x gains by early 2025, looking to beat XRP and AVAX XRP XRP has seen significant growth lately. In the past week, its price increased by 31.10%. Over the last month, it surged by 359.68%. Looking back over six months, XRP‚Äôs price has risen by an impressive 415.82%. Currently, it trades between $1.60 and $2.67, highlighting a strong upward trend. The coin is approaching its nearest resistance level at $3.05. Breaking through this point could lead XRP to the next resistance level at $4.11. These levels are important as they may influence future price movements. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $0.9099, which could help stabilize the price if it starts to fall. Technical indicators provide further insight. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $2.54, slightly above the 100-day average of $2.42, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 56.65, indicating that the market is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic value is 50.66, reflecting a neutral stance. The MACD level of 0.0159 hints at possible continued upward momentum. These indicators collectively suggest that XRP may continue its positive performance, but market dynamics can change rapidly. Cardano Cardano (ADA) has experienced substantial growth recently. In the past six months, its price increased by 169.39%. Over the last month, ADA surged by 191.89%. Even in the past week, there was a 10.10% rise. These significant gains reflect strong interest and momentum in the market. Currently, ADA trades between $0.96 and $1.25. The nearest resistance level is at $1.35. Breaking above this could push the price toward the second resistance at $1.64, a potential increase of around 31%. On the other hand, the nearest support level is at $0.77. A drop to this level would mean a decrease of about 20%. The second support sits at $0.49, indicating further downside risk if breached. Technical indicators are mixed. Both the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are at $1.20, showing price consolidation. The Relative Strength Index is 43.73, suggesting ADA is neither overbought nor oversold. The stochastic oscillator is at 30.19, reinforcing this neutral stance. However, the MACD level of -0.003241 hints at slight bearish momentum. This data suggests ADA‚Äôs price may continue to consolidate unless market conditions change. Pepe Pepe (PEPE) has been on a remarkable run lately. Over the past week, its price jumped by 32.71%. In the last month, it surged a staggering 143.78%. Looking back six months, PEPE has climbed 122.53%. This consistent upward trend highlights growing investor interest and strong market momentum. Currently, PEPE is trading between $0.00001862 and $0.00002462. It‚Äôs edging closer to its nearest resistance level at $0.00002698. If it breaks through, the next target is the second resistance at $0.00003298, which could mean a potential rise of about 34%. On the flip side, the nearest support level stands at $0.00001496. A drop to this point would represent a decrease of roughly 20%. Technical indicators suggest the bullish trend may continue. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is slightly above the current price range, indicating potential for further growth. The Relative Strength Index is at 67.08, close to overbought territory but still leaving room for an upward move. The positive MACD level reflects ongoing bullish momentum. Based on this data, PEPE‚Äôs price might keep rising in the near future. Conclusion XRP, ADA, PEPE, and XYZVerse are strong bets in the bull run; XYZVerse unites sports fans in a community-driven meme coin aiming for 20,000% growth and lasting impact.

37426670,https://coinpedia.org/?p=391133,1733758436,Meme Coin Market Reaches New ATH as Crypto All-Stars Raises $10.5M ‚Äì But ICO Ends In 11 Days,"The post Meme Coin Market Reaches New ATH as Crypto All-Stars Raises $10.5M ‚Äì But ICO Ends In 11 Days appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The meme coin market reached a new all-time high (ATH) valuation over the weekend of $133.7 billion, but Crypto All-Stars ($STARS) was one of the main beneficiaries as its presale raise crossed $10.5 million. After trailblazing success throughout its fundraising campaign, $STARS is now preparing to list on crypto exchanges. Investors are seizing the opportunity to buy the token before that happens, with almost $500,000 of capital pouring into the presale in the past 24 hours. The project is building a unified staking platform that lets users generate passive income on their meme coins. 2024 has been a transformative year for meme coins as the world begins to view them as respectable mid-term investments rather than short-term opportunistic bets like in the 2021 meme coin bull run. This is why the meme coin market reached a record-high valuation this weekend. Crypto All-Stars serves this longer-term outlook by allowing users to put their meme coins to work rather than leaving them sat uselessly in their wallets. The presale is running at $0.0016782, but it ends in 11 days, and then $STARS will be listed on the open market. As Bitcoin takes a breath around $100K, altcoins are growing and taking a bigger market share. Notably, meme coins are thriving, which is exactly what the Crypto All-Stars community wants to see. No Longer A Joke: Meme Coins like $STARS Are Dead-Serious Legacy media and more conservative crypto investors have succumbed to the power of meme coins and now regard them as an integral part of the industry. Players such as the Financial Times and Vitalik Buterin are among those who have switched their stance and accepted meme coins. Yes, they remain speculative and volatile assets. But as Vitalik wrote, they can also be a force for good, creating new use cases inside the crypto industry. Indeed, that‚Äôs exactly what Crypto All-Stars is doing. Investors can bet and have fun by holding their favorite meme and being a part of the community, but Crypto All-Stars turns these ‚Äújoke tokens‚Äù into strategic, revenue-bearing assets. Vitalik underscored multiple potential use cases, such as charity and gaming, which could birth meme coins that ‚Äúsupport public goods.‚Äù Floki is an example of a charity-focused meme coin, while Shiba Inu incorporates gaming. The meme coin sector is no longer just useless dog coins ‚Äì it‚Äôs an innovative financial asset class that merges fun with new possibilities. Crypto All-Stars is the project that ties all this together. Whether you hold Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Floki, Pepe, or something else, you can stake it in Crypto All-Stars‚Äô MemeVault and generate passive income. Is Crypto All-Stars The Next $1 Billion ? Crypto Project? There are now ten meme coins with a valuation above $1 billion. However, Crypto All-Stars is the first to unlock staking utility inside the sector, a much-needed addition for those seeking to maximal returns. But what‚Äôs interesting about Crypto All-Stars is that they simplify the experience of staking meme coins. You‚Äôll be able to stake all the top meme coins from one app, removing the headaches of managing different sites, learning different UIs, and having to switch back and forth to track your assets. MemeVault users will save time and bolster returns. It‚Äôs a no-brainer. The $STARS token is the centerpiece of this. Users can earn up to three times as much from MemeVault by maximizing their $STARS holdings. Forget $1 billion; $STARS could be heading much higher. MemeVault‚Äôs addressable market is over $100 billion. Users can also stake their $STARS tokens for more rewards. Right now, $STARS staking offers a 220% APY. Experts Greenlight Crypto All-Stars The project‚Äôs unique position as the only protocol offering unified meme coin staking services is drawing huge industry-wide attention. Popular crypto trader Danny Boo recently told his 64.8K YouTube subscribers that $STARS is the most bullish meme coin of the year. Boo underscored that meme coins are undergoing a ‚Äúsuper cycle,‚Äù where prices are rallying, unlike anything we‚Äôve seen before. With that, Crypto All-Stars‚Äô industry-first utility creates huge potential for gains. The project has also featured in leading media outlets like Cryptopotato and Cointelegraph , attesting to its ability to turn heads at the highest levels. Will Crypto All-Stars List on Binance or Coinbase In 11 days? As Crypto All-Stars veers towards its exchange launch, $STARS is set to list on exchanges, which provide exposure to a wider investor pool and increased liquidity. Its significant presale success shows that it has real market appeal, something that will not go unchecked by tier-1 platforms like Binance, Coinbase, and Robinhood. The All-Star Dominance Continues!

37426645,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/top-6-non-custodial-wallets-that-make-buying-crypto-as-simple-as-your-daily-coffee-run,1733758345,Top 6 Non-Custodial Wallets That Make Buying Crypto as Simple as Your Daily Coffee Run,"Buying crypto should be as easy as grabbing your morning coffee, and with the right non-custodial wallet, it can be. When it comes to fiat-to-crypto transactions, there are a few key features to look for. You want a wallet that supports quick and easy purchases with low fees, and offers multiple payment methods (like bank transfers or credit cards). Bonus points if it supports multiple blockchains and offers staking options to grow your assets. Here are the top 7 non-custodial wallets that make buying crypto simple and hassle-free. 1. NOW Wallet NOW Wallet provides effortless multi-chain support, allowing users to store, send, receive, buy, sell, exchange, and stake their assets seamlessly. One of its unique features is its easy fiat-to-crypto functionality ‚Äîan effective tool, especially for crypto newbies. All of this is made easy with ChangeNOW crypto exchange, ensuring that NOW Wallet users have access to seamless, limitless, and secure transactions with just a few taps. Supporting 60+ fiat currencies, NOW Wallet users can purchase crypto using Mastercard, Visa, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or bank transfers. Keep in mind that users don‚Äôt need to register or complete KYC to use NOW Wallet, but for fiat-to-crypto transactions, it‚Äôs required by the wallet‚Äôs partner services. NOW Wallet supports over 70 blockchains and 1,500 tokens. Once a user has crypto on their balance, they can start making transactions on different networks without leaving the app. If users happen to send tokens to the wrong network, NOW Wallet‚Äôs 24/7 customer support with a 99% resolution rate can help get them to the right place. This wallet simplifies transactions for different types of cryptos, including privacy coins such as Monero (XMR) , OGs like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) , meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) , Shiba Inu (SHIB) , and many more. Users can also enjoy the flexibility of adding custom tokens that run on supported EVM-compatible blockchains and Tron network. Moreso, NOW Wallet enables in-app staking of Tron (TRX) , Cardano (ADA) , NOW Token (NOW) , and more. For a more personalized experience, the wallet users get to unlock Pro benefits like cashback on each transaction, AML checks, unlimited crypto loans, and private domains for receiving crypto payments. NOW Wallet is accessible on Google Play and App Store as well as macOS , Windows , and Linux devices. 2. Coinbase Wallet Coinbase Wallet rides on the popularity of the US leading crypto exchange, Coinbase. The wallet supports thousands of digital assets, including NFTs, and offers the users the opportunity to purchase, swap, and stake these assets. Buying crypto with fiat is a breeze through Coinbase Onramp, offering an easy and intuitive interface. Users can access over 100 cryptocurrencies and more than 60 fiat currencies with a single integration. Recently, Coinbase added Apple Pay to its Onramp service, making it even more convenient. Users can fund their wallets with 100+ tokens, enjoy no fees on USDC, and have access to a wide range of fiat currencies. Although a product of a centralized exchange, it is considered one of the safest wallets in the crypto space. Features of its security architecture include two-factor authentication, multiple signatures, security locks, biometric logins, PINs, permission management, confirmation requests, and Ledger integration. However, unlike NOW Wallet and Metamask where you can choose transaction fee rates, there is a tendency for transaction fees to accumulate using Coinbase Wallet, especially for smaller transactions. The wallet‚Äôs strict vetting policy also means you have a limited number of cryptocurrencies and dApps available for user experience. 3. Metamask With over 30 million monthly active users, Metamask is one of the most popular non-custodial wallets. It provides a simple yet secure way to buy cryptocurrencies with fiat, store funds, and connect to blockchain-based applications. The wallet‚Äôs fiat-to-crypto feature is now available in around 200 countries. It was first introduced in April 2023 and has expanded since then to include various payment options like Apple Pay, debit and credit cards, PayPal, wire transfers, and ACH bank transactions, making it even easier to swap your fiat for crypto. Its portfolio site provides comprehensive insights into the performance of assets a user has across different networks. This feature allows the user to monitor trends, track price movements, stay informed, and make informed decisions. MetaMask primarily supports Ethereum and Ethereum-compatible blockchains. However, Metamask might be a poor option for individuals who store assets on non-EVM chains like Cardano or Solana. 4. Trust Wallet Trust Wallet lets users buy crypto with their local fiat currency, supported by global partners handling over 100 different currencies. Partners like MoonPay, Simplex, Banxa, Mercuryo, Ramp Network, and Transak manage the entire transaction process, making it easy to complete a purchase with just a few clicks directly from the app. Supporting thousands of crypto assets, Trust Wallet like Metamask and NOW Wallet, all users full control and management of their assets. It enables users to buy, send, receive, trade, and stake cryptocurrencies. Aside from the millions of crypto assets it supports, Trust Wallet is compatible with 100+ blockchains and stores over 600 million NFTs. This means that users can transact these assets without having to switch the app. Though its multitude of supported assets is a plus, it also serves as a drawback, especially for newbies. These users may struggle to discern between legit crypto assets and fake ones. Also, the absence of two-factor authentication also puts a flaw in Trust Wallet's security architecture. 5. Exodus Wallet Buying Bitcoin or crypto in Exodus is pretty straightforward. You can pay using debit or credit cards, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or a bank account. There are also a few third-party providers you can use, like MoonPay or PayPal. The process is smooth, and your crypto usually shows up in about 5-20 minutes, depending on network traffic. This wallet is known for its intuitive interface and ease of use. It has multichain compatibility and an integrated exchange through which users can quickly swap their tokens. They can also decide to earn passive income through its staking platform. Exodus also offers 24/7 customer support that is highly efficient. In addition to its customer service reps, this support spreads across different platforms and includes a chatbot, a 10,000+ Discord community, and a robust Reddit community. Unlike Metamask and Trust, however, Exodus is closed-source. Hence, there might be questions about its transparency. Also, the wallet lacks common security features such as multi-signature transaction approvals and two-factor authentication. 6. Zerion Wallet Zerion makes it simple to fund your wallet with fiat through a fiat onramp. Once you‚Äôre in the wallet, you can easily access the option to buy crypto, and it‚Äôll connect you to the onramp provider's platform. You just enter the amount you want to spend, confirm the wallet address, and choose your payment method. Depending on the transaction size, you might need to complete KYC verification. This process allows users to quickly convert fiat into crypto and add it directly to their Zerion wallet. Zerion supports over 60 DeFi protocols and has garnered more than 200,000 monthly active users. It comes with a DeFi interface and features through which users can invest, lend, borrow, and swap their digital assets. One distinguishing feature of this wallet is that while other wallets allow users to earn passive income through staking, Zerion users earn passive income by lending tokens and earning interest. Zerion is richly integrated with a plethora of DeFi protocols, which means users can easily access liquidity pools for rewards, as well as yield farming without having to interact with multiple dApps. However, unlike Metamask, NOW Wallet, or Trust Wallet‚Äôs vast range of support, supported blockchains on Zerion are quite limited. Summary The cryptoverse offers a wide array of wallets for users to store and manage their assets. However, not all of these wallets are reliable. This is why this article provides a comprehensive overview of some of the most reliable non-custodial wallets in the crypto space. All the wallets mentioned here‚ÄîNOW Wallet, Metamask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, Exodus, and Zerion‚Äîeach have their own perks, but NOW Wallet really stands out when it comes to making fiat-to-crypto transfers easy, plus, it offers a solid selection of tokens and plenty of options for what you can do with your crypto next.

37428145,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=104257,1733758334,Pundit Says XRP Will Retire a Lot of People: Here‚Äôs How,"Amid the resilience demonstrated by XRP, a market pundit insists the altcoin will be the reason multiple investors finally retire. The crypto market is currently facing investor uncertainty after a previous upsurge triggered by the latest Bitcoin (BTC) push toward $100,000 . Despite the pullback that ensued, XRP has shown resilience against further bearish pressure. As a result, the altcoin has held above $2.4 for days.This comes after a massive uptrend that allowed it to breach $2 on Dec. 1. Since recently overcoming the $2 mark for the first time in seven years, XRP has not dropped below the price mark despite the occasional pullbacks. This has bolstered confidence in its potential.Optimism Around XRP‚Äôs PotentialFor instance, Bark, a crypto market pundit and founder of Bark Media, boldly asserted that XRP is going to give multiple investors the necessary returns to allow them to retire. Notably, the goal for a lot of crypto investors is to make enough profit to retire from work.https://twitter.com/barkmeta/status/1863433776405082449However, the requirements for retirement vary depending on the investor‚Äôs geography and his appetite. While some individuals could retire on $700,000 if they live in a low-income country with less cost of living, others who live in places like the U.S. might require more to comfortably retire.Notably, a report from CNBC earlier in the year confirmed that a resident of Hawaii would need $2 million to retire for 25 years, marking the highest retirement threshold for any state in the U.S. However, the average 30-year retirement threshold in the U.S. is a little above $1 million.Given these realities, certain proponents have wondered if just holding XRP could retire an investor. Considering a retirement threshold of $2 million, above the average, an investor could hit this level based on his capital and the price targets that XRP is able to claim .At What Price Can XRP Retire Investors?This assessment would consider an initial investment of $10,000, allowing an entry point for the average retail investor. If an investor buys $10,000 worth of XRP at the current price of $2.44, he would procure 4,098 XRP tokens.¬†Notably, for these tokens to hit the retirement threshold of $2 million, XRP must reach an ambitious price of $488 per token. This would mark a massive appreciation rate of 19,900% for the altcoin, pushing its market cap to an audacious $27.8 trillion.¬†The chances of this materializing within the next few years are rather slim. As a result, investors looking to retire with XRP might need to commit more than $10,000 at current prices. For instance, a $400,000 investment in XRP would yield the $2 million retirement threshold at $12, a more realistic target .However, investors who already procured XRP before its recent breakout have better chances of retiring at lower price targets. Interestingly, an investor who procured $100,000 worth of XRP when it consolidated at $0.5 from Nov. 1 to 4, would have 200,000 tokens. These 200,000 XRP would be worth $2 million at a $10 price .Nonetheless, while these estimates can be rather enticing, it is important to note that they rely on speculative assessments. There is no guarantee that XRP would reach $10, $12 or any target necessary to make an investor retire.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/09/pundit-says-xrp-will-retire-a-lot-of-people-heres-how/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pundit-says-xrp-will-retire-a-lot-of-people-heres-how,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Last week, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $103,650. However, the momentum quickly waned as bearish activity drove the price downward.¬†Over the last 24 hours, Bitcoin‚Äôs value fell 1.3% to $98,978, though it remains up 4.19% over the past week. Amid this volatility, notable industry figures, including Changpeng Zhao, the former CEO of Binance, and MicroStrategy‚Äôs Michael Saylor, have weighed in on Bitcoin‚Äôs future trajectory.Bitcoin as the Future of MoneyDuring a recent discussion, Zhao addressed Bitcoin‚Äôs evolving role, emphasizing its utility beyond an investment asset. He highlighted how Bitcoin‚Äôs perception could shift over the next decade as nations potentially adopt it as a strategic reserve.¬†According to Zhao, this would likely bolster Bitcoin‚Äôs value mathematically. He refrained from providing a specific price prediction, stating it is difficult to quantify Bitcoin's long-term potential. Notably, when pressed for a number, Zhao reiterated his belief in Bitcoin‚Äôs unlimited upside, responding simply, ‚ÄúTo the moon.‚Äù Zhao‚Äôs remarks came as the crypto‚Äôs recent volatility captured global attention. Despite short-term price fluctuations, Zhao suggested Bitcoin‚Äôs adoption as a medium of exchange and its integration into national reserves could redefine its role in the financial ecosystem.Saylor Projects Exponential Growth for BitcoinSimilarly, during an interview, Michael Saylor reiterated his perspective on Bitcoin‚Äôs transformative potential. He described Bitcoin as ‚Äúdigital capital‚Äù and highlighted its attributes such as portability, programmability, and resilience against centralized risks. Saylor predicted exponential growth for the cryptocurrency, estimating its valuation could expand from $2 trillion to $280 trillion by 2045. This translates to a price of $13 million per Bitcoin. Interestingly, Binance founder CZ believes any number slammed on Bitcoin is attainable.Meanwhile, Saylor explained MicroStrategy‚Äôs unique strategy of leveraging financial instruments like convertible bonds to accumulate BTC. He argued that this approach aligns with the objectives of public companies and bridges traditional finance with the crypto economy. Additionally, he drew parallels between Bitcoin‚Äôs adoption curve and historical technological advancements.Notably, MicroStrategy has invested over $25 billion to acquire over 423,000 BTC tokens since 2020.Keiser Amplifies Forecast¬†Max Keiser, an advisor to El Salvador‚Äôs pro-Bitcoin government, has also raised his Bitcoin price prediction. Inspired by Saylor‚Äôs proposed strategy, Keiser increased his target from $200,000 to $2.2 million per Bitcoin.¬†Saylor had earlier suggested that the U.S. could counter economic threats from BRICS nations by adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset.

37426762,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623820,1733758200,Shiba Inu Price Prediction for December 2024 and Lightchain AI Insights,"The cryptocurrency market remains one of the most dynamic industries globally, constantly evolving with surprising turns. Two standout topics grabbing the attention of crypto enthusiasts right now are Shiba Inu ($SHIB) and the revolutionary Lightchain AI Protocol . Whether you‚Äôre looking to park your funds in familiar meme coins or explore fresh utility-driven tokens, this article covers all you need to know about price predictions for SHIB and the promising potential of Lightchain AI ($LCAI) . Shiba Inu Price Prediction for December 2024 Shiba Inu has been a crowd-favorite meme token that emerged as an ecosystem underdog in recent years, going well beyond its gimmick roots. Thanks to its growing utility, committed community, and planned developments like Shibarium (its Ethereum Layer 2 solution), many believe Shiba Inu has more bullish potential than meets the eye. Recent Performance Overview The past months have seen Shiba Inu trading steadily within the $0.000006 to $0.0000075 range . However, external market forces such as Federal Reserve policies and Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance play a significant role in its price fluctuations. SHIB has also benefited significantly from the meme-coin hype surrounding other tokens like Dogecoin, creating waves of speculative investment. üåä December 2024 Price Forecast Analysts and on-chain data indicate potential upward movement for Shiba Inu in December 2024. Here are the key factors driving this prediction: Token Burning Strategies : Shiba Inu developers have been ramping up token burn initiatives to reduce SHIB supply, positively impacting scarcity. Ecosystem Growth : Its utility-focused ecosystem, encompassing ShibaSwap, its metaverse project, and Shibarium, boosts investor confidence. Community Support : SHIB‚Äôs robust and passionate community actively contributes to its social media momentum and trading interest. Expected Price Range for December 2024: Bearish Estimate : $0.0000057 Base Case (Flat Market) : $0.0000075 Bullish Scenario üöÄ : $0.000010 (a psychological ceiling for many SHIB holders) üí° Pro Tip : Shiba Inu remains a volatile investment influenced by high-risk, high-reward opportunities in the crypto sector. Ideal for those with an adventurous appetite for growth. A Revolutionary Contender ‚Äî Lightchain AI and December Speculations While tokens like Shiba Inu capture headlines for their nostalgia and meme-worthy origins, pioneering platforms like Lightchain AI transform how we view blockchain meeting artificial intelligence . This cutting-edge project has been making waves due to its exceptional Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and its AI Virtual Machine (AIVM), offering developers a seamless computational layer for decentralized AI applications. If your portfolio needs future-ready use cases , Lightchain AI shouldn‚Äôt be flying under your radar. üåê How Lightchain AI is Capturing Attention Here‚Äôs what sets Lightchain apart: Proof of Intelligence (PoI): Unlike Proof of Work or Stake, PoI incentivizes meaningful AI contributions, such as training or optimization, while ensuring blockchain security. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): Designed to execute AI-specific tasks on the blockchain, making decentralized intelligence truly scalable. Decentralized Governance: Token holders play an active role in shaping the ecosystem, securing its alignment with community-driven growth. December Prediction for Lightchain AI ($LCAI) Price Currently, Lightchain AI‚Äôs Presale tokens are available at $0.001125‚Äîa discount that early adopters shouldn‚Äôt miss. üöÄ With the upcoming mainnet launch scheduled for Q1 2025 , analysts believe December will showcase increased demand. Here‚Äôs why: Institutional Interest in blockchain-AI projects will surge toward the year-end. Scarcity Factor: As the presale tokens sell out, $LCAI could experience immediate valuation boosts before listing. Community Momentum encouraged by Lightchain AI‚Äôs transparent roadmaps and exclusive partnerships. Predicted Price Range for December 2024: Base Case üåü : $0.0018 Bullish Figure üî• : $0.0025 (~100% potential upside from the current presale price) üí° Pro Tip : Unlike speculative assets, Lightchain AI offers long-term utility that could deliver exponential returns, especially once its ecosystem achieves widespread adoption. Why Consider Lightchain AI Over Traditional Tokens Like Shiba Inu? While meme tokens like Shiba Inu have their place in any diversified portfolio, Lightchain AI is a utility-driven project with revolutionary implications for AI-blockchain integration . Here‚Äôs what makes it a compelling investment compared to typical meme coins: Real-world applications in AI tasks like model training and inference. A decentralized ecosystem governed by the community itself. An early-bird opportunity via its ongoing presale (available at a discounted entry point).

This milestone surpasses the previous high achieved just weeks earlier, pushing year-to-date (YTD) inflows to $41 billion. Additionally, total assets under management (AuM) for digital assets have reached a new peak of $165 billion, nearly double the $83 billion high from the 2021 cycle.Bitcoin Dominates the Weekly Inflow Records Bitcoin remained the primary beneficiary of the latest record-breaking weekly inflow. It secured $2.5 billion in weekly inflows, bringing its YTD total to $36.5 billion.This new record follows Bitcoin‚Äôs historic milestone in the spot market, where its floor value surpassed $100K last week. After overcoming the $100K barrier, the premier asset went on to establish its all-time high at $104,000.¬†While Bitcoin‚Äôs price continued to consolidate in the $90K region after its record rally, it later achieved another historic milestone by closing above $100K for the first time ever on December 8.This development affected Bitcoin products, spilling over to the broader crypto market.Record Inflows in Ethereum ETPsEthereum investment products, in particular, experienced their largest weekly inflow ever, amassing $1.2 billion.

""President-elect Donald Trump's reelection triggered a historic rally and jump in market caps across the crypto ecosystem,"" analysts led by Kenneth Worthington wrote. This included tokens, decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins and publicly listed companies with crypto exposure.  The bank noted that the crypto ecosystem recorded its best monthly return, with its market cap rising 45%. Total crypto market cap swelled to $3.3 trillion.

37426579,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624922,1733757531,The Royal Government of Bhutan extends its Bitcoin (BTC) selling streak,"The Royal Government of Bhutan is extending its selling streak, moving more Bitcoin (BTC) to external exchanges. After years of accumulation, the known wallets of Druk Holdings are moving assets once again. The Royal Government of Bhutan is taking profits with its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings. After accumulating for years through mining operations, the known state-owned wallets are once again moving their assets for an imminent sale. The latest transaction was for 100 BTC, sent to an unknown CoinJoin address. Before that, the state‚Äôs wallets sent out 406.074 BTC to QCP Capital, one of the government‚Äôs usual counterparties. The latest sale is valued at around $40M, after previous smaller tranches to Binance. The current wallet transfers are also not necessarily a direct sale as they may be linked to further investments using BTC. The Royal Government of Bhutan is selling at a time when BTC miners are also shedding some of their holdings, taking advantage of prices close to $100,000 per coin. Miner reserves are now down to 1.89M coins, from a recent level of 1.91M. Miners have been selling for the past six months, with accelerated deposits after BTC had its latest Q4 rally. The Royal Government of Bhutan uses either QCP Capital or Binance for selling some of its mined coins. QCP Capital is known for its tailored solutions to trading BTC, with the potential for OTC selling for large orders. Bhutan joins BTC miners in liquidating holdings The sale took place just as BTC slid further down, to $98,469.80. For most miners, this price is above even the most expensive production fees for new BTC. However, direct selling to exchanges at this price range may lead to additional slippage or panic, leading Bhutan to choose a personalized solution. Even after recent sales, the Royal Government of Bhutan still holds more than $1.153B in BTC, as the asset is still relatively close to its all-time high. However, the last transfers from Foundry Digital and Antpool are from three months ago, with no more daily mining inflows. Other known wallets received mining inflows a month ago, retaining another 2,465 BTC . A smaller wallet holds 1,768 BTC, while a smaller intermediary wallet holds 188.85 BTC . In the past few hours, some of the BTC holdings were sent to the last wallet for additional reserves. After the latest divestment, the Royal Government of Bhutan retains 11,688 BTC in its main known wallet. The total estimated holdings from all known wallets may be up to 12,200 BTC. Bhutan BTC holding is an alternative to foreign reserves The Royal Government of Bhutan‚Äôs holdings puts it ahead of Tesla and US Riot Platforms . The wallet is the fifth-largest based on other countries‚Äô estimates, holding 0.05 of the entire BTC supply. The country can be ranked third, but other reports put Ukraine in that place, with 46,351 BTC from various donations. On the scale of the BTC economy, Bhutan‚Äôs holdings lag behind those of even relatively small exchanges. However, the BTC wallets are key to Bhutan‚Äôs stability. The country has around $648M in foreign reserves , down from 981M in 2021. BTC is a highly liquid asset, which can boost reserves and provide new investment opportunities for the small kingdom. Bhutan‚Äôs BTC wallet also makes up a significant size of the Bhutan economy, which produces $2.7B annually. Bitcoin‚Äôs appreciation in the past few months has added significantly to the country‚Äôs GDP, though some of the profits are unrealized. The country has mined BTC since 2019, though reports of its full mining capabilities emerged in the past year. Bhutan uses excess renewable hydroelectric power for its mining facilities, after committing to a data center investment. For now, governments lag behind corporate BTC holders, as most of the coins are still taken up for treasuries, or for ETF reserves. Talk of official state reserves of BTC have not been connected to official policy, and most large government holdings are still from confiscated assets.

42389447,59ab169b-3ef6-4593-ae68-491163db4823,1733757350,El Salvador to Change Bitcoin Law as Part of New IMF Deal: FT,"El Salvador may roll back a small aspect of its Bitcoin law as part of a new deal with the International Monetary Fund.    The Latin American country may no longer require Salvadorean merchants to accept bitcoin (BTC) as a means of payment across the nation, instead making bitcoin acceptance voluntary, according to a new report from the Financial Times.   The legal modification is part of the conditions imposed by the IMF for El Salvador to gain access to a $1.3 billion loan program, the report said. The World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank are also expected to lend an extra $1 billion each to the nation, for a total of $3.3 billion. The agreement is projected to be reached within the next two or three weeks.   El Salvador shook the world when it made bitcoin legal tender in 2021, granting the top cryptocurrency the same regulatory status as the nation‚Äôs official currency, the U.S. dollar. At the same time the country‚Äôs president, Nayib Bukele, has pursued the establishment of a bitcoin Treasury, the holding of which has neared $600 million at bitcoin's current price of roughly $100,000.  The IMF, however, has criticized the approach and issued various warnings over the years that El Salvador‚Äôs bitcoin strategy could imperil the nation‚Äôs financial stability.   The law change is unlikely to significantly impact bitcoin adoption across the country, which has been relatively poor. The Central American University, Bukele‚Äôs alma mater, found in January that 88% of surveyed Salvadorans hadn‚Äôt used Bitcoin in 2023.    Modifications to the bitcoin law aren‚Äôt the only condition imposed by the IMF. The Salvadoran government will also need to commit ‚Äî via spending cuts and tax increases ‚Äî to reducing its budget deficit to 3.5% of GDP over three years, the report said. Increased reserves and the passing of an anti-corruption law will also be necessary, according to the report.   Beyond the Bitcoin law, El Salvador‚Äôs National Commission of Digital Assets (CNAD) has already developed a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto. At press time, the agency had not responded to a request for comment on the potential bitcoin law modification.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/12/09/el-salvador-to-change-bitcoin-law-as-part-of-new-imf-deal-financial-times,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e45359923799a19c2d522da1ea88ebace7e1d7a2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
37426477,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-the-turbo-train-hop-on-the-btfd-rocket/,1733757349,Missed the Turbo Train? Hop on the BTFD Rocket,"Did you miss the Turbo train? FOMO kicking in? Don‚Äôt worry, crypto enthusiast! A new, high-flying meme coin is ready to take off: BTFD Coin. With a presale that‚Äôs already raised over $1.5M in less than a month, BTFD Coin is quickly gaining momentum. This isn‚Äôt just any ordinary meme coin; it‚Äôs a rocket ship fueled by community enthusiasm and a solid project foundation. So, what makes BTFD Coin so special? Let‚Äôs dive in! Turbo: The Golden ICO That Many Missed Remember the wild ride with Turbo? Yeah, the one that shot to the moon faster than you can say ‚Äúdiamond hands.‚Äù It was a total rollercoaster, a crypto craze that had everyone losing their minds. Turbo‚Äôs market cap went from zero to hero, peaking at a whopping $555 million. The trading volume was insane, hitting a 24-hour high of over $180 million. Social media was flooded with Turbo memes, tweets, and all sorts of hype. It was like a digital gold rush, and everyone wanted a piece of the action. Unfortunately, as quickly as it rose, the Turbo craze began to cool down. Many investors who missed the initial surge were left wondering if they had missed their chance at crypto glory. BTFD Coin: Your New Opportunity to Cash In Big BTFD Coin is quickly making a name for itself with a presale that‚Äôs already raising eyebrows. For a $100 investment at the current price of $0.000076 per coin, you would acquire approximately 1.32 million coins. When the price increases to $0.0006 by the end of the presale, your $100 investment would grow to around $789.47, giving you an impressive return of 689.47%. . But there‚Äôs so much more to BTFD Coin than just its presale. Let‚Äôs dive into some of its coolest features that make this coin a must-buy now. 1. The Play2Earn Game: Turning Fun into Profits BTFD Coin is bringing something unique to the table with its upcoming Play2Earn (P2E) game. This isn‚Äôt just any crypto game‚Äîit‚Äôs designed to integrate directly into the BTFD Coin ecosystem, allowing players to earn in-game rewards that can be converted into BTFD tokens. So while you‚Äôre having fun, you‚Äôre also stacking coins! This Play2Earn model is expected to generate massive attention and engagement, especially with the younger crypto crowd who are eager to earn while they play. By gamifying the experience, BTFD Coin taps into the growing trend of crypto gaming, which means it could see a flood of new investors and users once the game goes live. 2. Staking Rewards: APY That‚Äôs Almost Too Good to Be True If you‚Äôre looking for long-term rewards, BTFD Coin has you covered. With staking rewards offering an average APY (annual percentage yield) of 90%, this is the type of passive income most crypto enthusiasts dream of. Imagine earning a hefty return just by locking up your BTFD Coins and letting them grow over time. Plus, you‚Äôll be a part of the community that‚Äôs driving the coin‚Äôs success. BTFD Coin‚Äôs staking rewards aren‚Äôt just about high APY; they‚Äôre designed to benefit the holders who believe in the project‚Äôs long-term growth. By locking up tokens for a set period, you help stabilize the ecosystem while reaping the benefits of compounded rewards. 3. The Bulls Squad: A Strong, Vibrant Community A key element of BTFD Coin‚Äôs rise is its community‚Äîthe Bulls Squad. These are the passionate, dedicated characters that represent the values and vision of BTFD Coin . Each member of the squad plays a role in promoting the project, rallying behind its mission, and getting the word out. Whether it‚Äôs Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, or Peoples Bull, they all have unique traits that resonate with the broader crypto community. The Bulls Squad isn‚Äôt just about characters‚Äîit‚Äôs about fostering a sense of belonging and support within the ecosystem. As more people get involved, the community grows stronger, and that means more attention, more partnerships, and ultimately more value for holders of BTFD Coin. 4. Affordable Entry with High Potential Returns At just $0.00005 per coin in Stage 5 of the presale, BTFD Coin is still incredibly affordable for early investors. But that low entry price is poised to climb as the presale progresses and the project gains traction. If you jump in now, you‚Äôre getting in at the ground level before BTFD Coin goes mainstream. To give you an example, if you were to invest $5,500 at the current price, you‚Äôd get: $5,500 √∑ $0.00005 = 110,000,000 BTFD Coins And if the price of BTFD Coin rises to $0.0006 by the end of the presale (which is highly plausible given the excitement around the project), your 110 million coins would be worth: 110,000,000 √ó $0.0006 = $66,000 That‚Äôs a 12x return on your investment‚Äî$5,500 today could turn into $66,000 in the near future! With a community that‚Äôs already growing rapidly and a product that has the potential to disrupt the meme coin space, BTFD Coin is an opportunity you don‚Äôt want to miss. Conclusion: Get In Before It‚Äôs Too Late Here‚Äôs the deal‚ÄîTurbo may have already taken off, but BTFD Coin is just about to hit its stride. The presale is on fire, the community is buzzing, and the potential for huge returns is there. If you‚Äôre looking for your next big investment in the meme coin world, BTFD Coin is the one to watch. With a presale price of just $0.00005 per coin, this is your chance to scoop up a massive amount of tokens before the price climbs. Don‚Äôt let this second opportunity pass you by‚Äîjoin the BTFD Coin presale today and be part of the next meme coin success story!

Ripple ( XRP ) dropped to a low of $2.40, down by 16.2% from its highest level this year, bringing its market cap to $138 billion. Its retreat followed Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple Labs‚Äô CEO, appearing on 60 Minutes, the popular program on CBS. In an X post after the interview, he noted that it was edited to exclude some of the details. Specifically, Garlinghouse highlighted that 60 Minutes did not mention XRP‚Äôs status as not being a security, a position confirmed by a federal judge in 2023. You might also like: Missed the XRP price surge? 3 old-school crypto to consider He also criticized the program for implying that XRP had no utility, likening this perspective to early criticisms of the internet. Garlinghouse maintained that Ripple Labs handles billions of dollars in KYC-compliant transactions for institutional customers. Crypto made its debut on @60Minutes tonight ‚Äì there‚Äôs no doubt that these technologies will continue to become more and more mainstream ‚Äì with influence and reach that will only continue to grow. A few things I do want to comment on after watching: I spoke with Margaret‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 9, 2024 In its most recent results, Ripple said that the network handled over 172 million transactions in the third quarter , a 99% annualized increase. The network burned 598,477 XRP tokens generated from transaction fees, a 21% increase from the same period last year. XRP price has performed strongly over the past few months, becoming one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies. It surged 382% from its lowest level in November, positioning it as the third-biggest cryptocurrency in the market. This rally was fueled by optimism that Donald Trump‚Äôs Securities and Exchange Commission would adopt a more crypto-friendly stance compared to Gary Gensler‚Äôs tenure. In line with this, investors anticipate that Paul Atkins may decide to do away with the pending appeal by the agency. Also, the agency may approve a spot XRP ETF as soon as in 2025.

This decline has mirrored the broader market trend, as Bitcoin and other altcoins also began the week in the red. Despite the pullback, XRP remains above the key resistance level of $1.9700, its peak in April 2021. Ripple is still significantly above the 50-week and 200-week Exponential Moving Averages. The most likely scenario suggests XRP could drop to retest support at $1.9700 before resuming its uptrend. This break-and-retest pattern is a common continuation indicator.

These ETFs have drawn nearly $10 billion since Donald Trump‚Äôs election win and now cumulatively hold total net assets of $112.74 billion. This all signals bullish sentiments for the market after the appointment of a crypto-friendly SEC head.

It seems like big players will have access to high liquidity while trading. It added that Goldman Sachs has a suite of Bitcoin and Ether ETPs. This includes US BTC ETFs like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), and more.

Analysts Answer!,"Although the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin briefly surpassed $100,000 yesterday, it started the new week weakly and fell to $98,000. This decline affected altcoins and left investors with leveraged positions in a bind. According to Coinglass data, $495 million worth of leveraged transactions were liquidated in the last 24 hours, $413 million of which were long positions and $82 million were short positions. While 200 thousand investors liquidated in the last 24 hours, the largest liquidation occurred in the DOGE/USDT trading pair on Binance. While Bitcoin is trending sideways, analysts have announced their expectations for Bitcoin. Ethereum Will Launch After January! At this point, analysts at Singapore-based crypto company QCP Capital announced that they expect Bitcoin and the crypto market to move within a certain range until 2025. Adding that Bitcoin and the market are still in an upward trend, analysts stated that they expect an increase and ATH in Ethereum after January. ‚ÄúWhile we are still structurally bullish, spot prices are likely to remain in this range for the remainder of the holiday season. Historically, Ethereum typically doesn‚Äôt reach a new all-time high until January of the post-halving year. This sentiment is also reflected in the options market, where ETH risk-on returns are skewed toward calls only from January onwards.‚Äù Bitcoin Could Reach $120,000! Alex Kuptsikevich, senior analyst at FxPro, said that Bitcoin‚Äôs failure to stay above $100,000 is a worrying sign for bullish momentum: ‚ÄúBitcoin is failing to consolidate above $100,000, which is likely suppressing buying in the broader market. Bitcoin‚Äôs lack of bullishness and growth has also negatively impacted altcoins. We view Bitcoin‚Äôs lull as a significant position correction that will help the market shake off short-term overbought conditions and move higher more reliably.

Here‚Äôs the Timeline,"In a recent update, crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) shared insights on XRP‚Äôs potential price trajectory, referencing his detailed analysis from 2022.

This projection identifies critical price levels and trend lines, offering a structured view of how XRP might move through various corrective and impulsive waves. The technical roadmap is centered around three trend lines (TLs): Trend Line 1 (TL1): XRP breaking TL1 was identified as a key event, signaling the start of a bullish movement. Trend Line 2 (TL2): For continued momentum, XRP needed to surpass TL2, a significant resistance point. Trend Line 3 (TL3): TL3 is the ultimate barrier for XRP to overcome to achieve higher targets. The digital asset has now broken above the levels stated by EGRAG CRYPTO in 2022, and he expects it will complete the Elliott Wave pattern . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Projected Waves and Price Targets EGRAG CRYPTO‚Äôs analysis outlines XRP‚Äôs journey through a series of waves based on the Elliott Wave Theory. These include both impulsive (I) and corrective (C) waves, each representing different stages of price action: Wave 1 (W1): XRP moves upward to $1.40, encountering resistance at TL3. The digital asset has completed this phase as it broke above the $1.4 level. Wave 2 (W2 ‚Äì Corrective): A retracement to $0.55, aligning with TL2. This correction is critical for market consolidation. This is the correction the analyst is warning about, as a decline to $0.55 will discourage many investors. According to EGRAG CRYPTO, this could come in March 2025. However, the journey doesn‚Äôt end here. Wave 3 (W3 ‚Äì Impulsive): The most impactful impulsive wave, driving XRP past TL3 to approximately $7.50. Wave 4 (W4 ‚Äì Corrective): Another pullback to $3.30, reflecting a temporary market slowdown before the next surge. Wave 5 (W5 ‚Äì Impulsive): The final upward movement, projecting XRP to its peak target of $27. EGRAG CRYPTO‚Äôs advice to adopt a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy allows investors to spread their risk while potentially benefiting from long-term gains, especially during corrective phases like Wave 2 and Wave 4. The analyst has predicted a rise to $27 in the past, and with multiple factors currently favoring XRP, it could hit this target if it follows the pattern predicted by EGRAG CRYPTO.

The most dominant memecoin, Dogecoin, has now turned bearish as the BTC price is flashing bearish signals. Meanwhile, the DOGE price remains within the bullish range, while the Shiba Inu price may face a notable pullback and trade within the same range after experiencing a 12% rise in the next 48 hours. Dogecoin Consolidating Ahead of a Major Move After breaking above the consolidation below $0.15, the DOGE price soared by above 150% and entered a bullish pattern. The price is currently trading within a rising parallel channel but the bulls are holding the rally above the average levels. This suggests they continue to hold a large dominance and may keep up a consolidated ascending trend ahead. The DOGE price suggests the price has formed a bull flag as the levels trade within a rising parallel channel. The Bollinger bands have contracted and are going parallel with each other suggesting a drop in the volatility. This can be reflected in the MACD, which suggests a drop in volume and pressure. The bulls are defending the support by backing the rally at regular intervals, which suggests the price could be primed for a massive rise and reach $0.55 if they manage to breach the resistance. Shiba Inu in a Decessive Phase Shiba Inu price is trading within a rising wedge, which is believed to be bearish in the long term. The market participants are believed to get a good buying opportunity before the end of the first fortnight, which may keep up the trend for the rest of the month until the year-end. This move is expected to push the SHIB price beyond the threshold, which could pave the way for a new ATH. As seen in the above chart, the SHIB price is testing the support of the rising wedge, and as the technicals have gone bearish, the token is expected to breach the lower support. The MACD displays a drop in the buying pressure and the levels are about to undergo a bearish crossover. Additionally, the RSI is testing the immediate support at 57.87 and a drop beyond this level may initiate a fresh bearish trend, dragging the levels just below $0.00003. However, this could be a good buying opportunity as the price is primed for a rebound and reclaim highs above $0.000035 before 2024 ends.",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOGE | SHIB,ALTCOIN | BTC | DOGE | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/shib-price-turns-bullish-while-doge-preparing-for-a-rally-after-the-consolidation-heres-when-they-may-mark-a-new-ath/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

They are called four meggers because they are almost 4 megabytes (MB) big (the maximum size of each block of transactions on Bitcoin). Ordinals collectors consider them valuable due to their visibility on the blockchain.  ""There's more than just bragging rights behind wanting to have the largest file on Bitcoin,"" said Toby Lewis, co-founder of OrdinalsBot. ""Four meggers will be on the Bitcoin blockchain forever and they already hold significant market value.""  Bitcoin inscriptions, similar to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum, were made possible by the Ordinals protocol. It allows data to be ""inscribed"" onto individual satoshis, or ""sats"" (the smallest unit of BTC at 1/100,000,000 of a full bitcoin), making each one unique and potentially valuable.   To build on MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor's analogy of Bitcoin as real estate in a cyber Manhattan, minting a four-megger is the equivalent of buying an entire skyscraper rather than a single office or apartment.  Almost 4 MB  Pizza Ninja No. 1500 is 3.969429 MB in size and was mined at block 873,893 at 05:57 UTC (00:57 a.m. ET) on Dec. 9 by BTC miner MARA Holdings (MARA).   To be clear, it's not technically possible to inscribe a file of exactly 4 MB, but the term four meggers is given to files larger than 3.5 MB.  ""By the constraints of the blockchain, you're never going to get a file of exactly 4 MB because there's always some transactional overhead,"" OrdinalsBot's other co-founder, Brian Laughlan, told CoinDesk in an interview.   ""People come to us and say, 'I want to have the largest file ever inscribed,' so we look at the current largest and try to squeeze every single byte to beat it,"" he said.  This could be compared to track and field events, where athletes attempt to beat the 100-meter world record by 0.01 seconds or the long jump record by a centimeter or two.   The first Runestone, also minted by OrdinalsBot and MARA in February in anticipation of the Runestones airdrop, was the largest file at the time and was subsequently auctioned for 10 BTC ($972,000).  Pizza Ninja #1500  The ninja in question is ""Ralf,"" a playable character and antagonist in the on-chain Ordinals game Pizza Pets. The file is an interactive app built with HTML and JavaScript, which allows anyone to use it in any digital medium, something which is ""nearly possible"" to do on Ethereum, according to Pizza Ninjas co-founder Trevor Owens.  ""All the data is just raw on-chain, which you can't do in a smart contract on Ethereum very easily, because it has its own programming language and you can't just put HTML and JavaScript in there to make an application,"" he told CoinDesk.  Ordinals have been a controversial topic among many in the Bitcoin community because of concerns that they clog the network and drive up transaction fees. However, they can also honor the culture and history of the original cryptocurrency. By attaching uniqueness to individual satoshis, developers could draw attention to certain niches of the Bitcoin world, much like putting historical artifacts in a museum.  For example, all of the Pizza Ninjas are inscribed on satoshis from the 10,000 BTC that Laszlo Hanyecz exchanged for two pizzas on May 22, 2010, believed to be the first time anyone used bitcoin to pay for goods.  Pizza Ninja #1500 is inscribed on a ""black uncommon pizza sat."" Black uncommon sats are the last satoshis of each individual block. Therefore the black uncommon pizza sat is the last sat of the block on which the pizza transaction was recorded.

37425595,https://coinpaper.com/6437/ai-driven-scammers-target-web3-professionals-with-malware-laced-apps,1733755721,AI-Driven Scammers Target Web3 Professionals with Malware-Laced Apps,"The fake apps are embedded with Realst info-stealing malware. These attacks target sensitive data, including crypto wallet credentials. It is expected that the apps may be North Korea-linked, just like the $50 million exploit of Radiant Capital. Meanwhile, authorities made some progress with the arrest of Dmitry V., former head of WEX, which is a crypto exchange tied to fraud and money laundering. Web3 Workers Under Threat Web3 professionals are being targeted by a sophisticated malware campaign that uses fake meeting applications to steal sensitive information, including credentials for websites, applications, and crypto wallets. According to a report by Cado Security Labs, scammers employ artificial intelligence to create legitimate-looking websites and social media profiles for fraudulent companies. They use these platforms to lure targets into downloading a malicious meeting app. The app was named ‚ÄùMeeten,‚Äù but now goes by ‚ÄùMeetio‚Äù and it frequently changes its branding. It also previously operated under domains like Clusee.com, Meeten.gg, and Meetone.gg. The application contains Realst info-stealing malware that is designed to extract critical information, including Telegram logins, banking details, and crypto wallet credentials, which are then sent to the attackers. The malware can also harvest browser cookies, autofill credentials from web browsers like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, and even access data related to hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor, as well as Binance Wallets. The campaign also employs social engineering tactics, as scammers sometimes impersonate known contacts to build trust. In one instance, a target reported being approached on Telegram by someone posing as a colleague and receiving an investment presentation stolen from their own company. Other victims shared experiences of being on calls related to Web3 projects, downloading the malicious software, and subsequently losing their cryptocurrency. Fake meeting app (Source: Cado Security ) To boost their credibility even more, scammers established company websites populated with AI-generated blogs, product descriptions, and social media accounts on platforms like X and Medium. This use of AI allows them to produce very convincing content very quickly, which makes their fraudulent operations appear legitimate and harder to detect. In some cases, their fake websites include JavaScript capable of stealing crypto stored in web browsers even before the malware is downloaded. The campaign is targeting both macOS and Windows users and has been active for close to four months. Similar scams have been observed in the crypto space. On-chain investigator ZackXBT uncovered a group of 21 developers, believed to be North Koreans, working on projects using fake identities. In September, the FBI also issued a warning about North Korean hackers deploying malware disguised as employment offers to target crypto companies and decentralized finance platforms. North Korean Group Behind Radiant Capital Breach Radiant Capital revealed that the $50 million hack on its decentralized finance (DeFi) platform in October was orchestrated by a North Korea-linked hacker who infiltrated the platform using malware distributed through Telegram. The attacker posed as a trusted ex-contractor, and sent a zip file to a Radiant developer on Sept. 11 under the pretense of seeking feedback on a new project. Cybersecurity firm Mandiant , contracted by Radiant, confirmed with high confidence that the attack was carried out by a Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea (DPRK)-affiliated threat actor. The malicious zip file appeared legitimate because of its routine nature in professional settings, and was shared among developers. This allowed the malware to infect multiple devices. The attackers then gained control of private keys and smart contracts, which forced Radiant to halt its lending markets on Oct. 16. The malware also spoofed the contractor‚Äôs legitimate website, deceiving the developers even more. While traditional checks and transaction simulations showed no irregularities, the attackers manipulated the front-end interface to display benign transaction data while executing malicious transactions in the background. The threat actor was identified as ‚ÄúUNC4736‚Äù or ‚ÄúCitrine Sleet,‚Äù and is associated with North Korea‚Äôs Reconnaissance General Bureau and may be a sub-group of the notorious Lazarus Group. After the attack, $52 million of the stolen funds were moved by the hackers on Oct. 24. According to Radiant, even more advanced security measures, including hardware wallets, simulation tools like Tenderly, and industry-standard SOPs, were not good enough against such a sophisticated threat. Radiant TVL (Source: DefiLlama ) This incident was the second major compromise for Radiant this year, and happened after a $4.5 million flash loan exploit in January . A crypto flash loan attack is a type of exploit in DeFi platforms where an attacker takes advantage of flash loans to manipulate market conditions or exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Flash loans are uncollateralized loans that must be borrowed and repaid in a single blockchain transaction. Attackers use these loans to execute complex sequences of actions that can, for example, manipulate the price of assets, trick smart contracts into releasing funds, or drain liquidity pools. Because the loan and repayment happen almost instantaneously, the attacker can profit without risking their own capital. The series of hacks seriously¬†impacted the platform‚Äôs standing, with its total value locked plummeting from over $300 million at the end of last year to just $6.07 million as of Dec. 9, according to DefiLlama . Polish Authorities Detain Ex-WEX Head Dmitry V. Although crypto crime is still an issue, authorities are working hard to bring these criminals to justice. Polish authorities arrested Dmitry V., the former chief of the Russia-based crypto exchange WEX, in Warsaw after an extradition request from the United States Department of Justice. Dmitry V‚Äôs full name was withheld due to local laws, and he is accused of fraud and money laundering during his management of WEX, which was the successor to BTC-e. The arrest was confirmed by a Polish police spokesperson, who stated that Dmitry V. is in custody and awaiting extradition proceedings. If extradited to the U.S., he could face charges carrying a maximum prison sentence of 20 years. Dmitry V. has a history of arrests and releases across multiple countries. In August of 2021, he was detained in Poland but released after 40 days. He was arrested again in Croatia in 2022 by Interpol at Zagreb Airport after an extradition request from Kazakhstan. In 2019, Italian authorities arrested him, but he was later released when errors in the extradition request were discovered. WEX collapsed in 2018, which left approximately $450 million unaccounted for. The platform was often described as a ‚Äúdark‚Äù exchange, and was notorious for its lack of identity verification and its involvement in laundering funds from high-profile crypto hacks, including the Mt. Gox breach. At its peak, WEX handled more than $9 billion in transactions from more than a million users, including many from the United States. This latest WEX arrest happened after developments with Alexander Vinnik, the former head of BTC-e, WEX‚Äôs predecessor. Vinnik was nicknamed ‚ÄúMr. Bitcoin,‚Äù and pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering for activities between 2011 and 2017. He was arrested in Greece in 2017, and was later extradited to the U.S. in 2022 after serving two years in a French prison.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | WALLET,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6437/ai-driven-scammers-target-web3-professionals-with-malware-laced-apps,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png
37425527,https://finbold.com/?p=218138,1733755554,This is how Cardano (ADA) performed in 2024 so far,"Cardano ( ADA ) has emerged as one of the standout performers in the cryptocurrency market this year, with its price surging from $0.60 at the beginning of 2024 to $1.13 at the time of writing‚Äîa 90% year-to-date (YTD) gain. Despite facing challenges along the way, Cardano‚Äôs ecosystem has made significant strides in governance, network activity, and decentralized finance ( DeFi ), positioning itself for long-term growth. At press time, ADA is trading at $1.13 with a one-day decline of 6%. On the weekly chart, the token is up 2.25%. ADA five-day price chart. Source: Finbold Positive momentum: Governance milestones and ecosystem growth Cardano‚Äôs DeFi ecosystem has experienced explosive growth, with its total value locked (TVL) increasing from $370 million in January 2024 to $602 million by December 9 according to DefiLlama. This surge is mirrored in ADA‚Äôs price performance, which has climbed 157% in the past month, reaching $1.20 and tripling its value compared to the previous month. According to Input Output Global (IOG), Cardano has surpassed 100 million total transactions, adding 2.65 million in November alone. Furthermore, the number of projects built on Cardano has reached 1,979, with 603 new initiatives launched this year, highlighting its vibrant developer activity. Whale activity and network accumulation have also been key drivers of ADA‚Äôs price recovery. Data from CoinGlass reveals that ADA has exhibited heightened volatility, with sharp net outflows from exchanges driving a significant price rally in late November. ADA spot inflow/outflow. Source: CoinGlass This behavior suggests a bullish sentiment, as reduced supply on exchanges often leads to upward price momentum. However, intermittent inflows during the rally indicate some profit-taking, as traders brought ADA back to exchanges, possibly to capitalize on the price surge. For traders and investors, the substantial outflows hint at strong holding behavior, which could support further price growth if demand continues to rise. However, caution is warranted during inflow spikes, as they may introduce short-term selling pressure. Derivatives data and governance breakthrough Cardano derivatives data also reveals a significant surge in trading activity, with a 31.53% increase in volume, bringing the total to $2.27 billion. The long/short ratio highlights a predominance of long positions across major platforms, with Binance and OKX reporting ratios of 4.13 and 3.65, respectively, indicating bullish sentiment among traders. ADA derivatives data. Source: CoinGlass However, liquidation data (‚Äúrekt‚Äù) shows that shorts experienced heavier losses, particularly over the past 12 hours, with $5.68 million in liquidated longs compared to $187.64K in shorts, hinting at a volatile trading environment. Another defining moment for Cardano in 2024 came in December with the approval of its Constitution during a global convention held in Argentina and Kenya. This foundational document establishes governance protocols, scaling strategies, and Treasury management policies. The Constitution will move on-chain next month for endorsement by decentralized representatives (DReps), ensuring decentralized governance remains a core feature of the network. In parallel, speculation about Input Output CEO Charles Hoskinson‚Äôs potential involvement in shaping U.S. crypto policy under a new Trump administration has sparked intrigue about Cardano‚Äôs role in future regulatory developments. Hoskinson also revealed plans for a dedicated policy division at IOG, set to launch in January 2025. Challenges and risks While Cardano has achieved remarkable milestones, 2024 has not been without its hurdles. On December 8, the Cardano Foundation‚Äôs official X account was compromised, resulting in two false announcements that temporarily disrupted market sentiment. The first misleading announcement claimed the launch of a Cardano-branded token on Solana, which generated over $500,000 in trading volume according to DexScreener , before being exposed as a scam. The second false claim alleged that the Cardano Foundation was facing a lawsuit from the SEC and would cease support for ADA. Technical analysis paints a bearish picture From a technical perspective, ADA‚Äôs price action has revealed a rising wedge pattern, a bearish indicator that suggests a potential reversal. Analyst Ali Martinez warns that a close below key levels at $1.10 and $1.03 could trigger a bearish breakout, pushing the price down to $0.88‚Äîa 20% correction. #Cardano $ADA could be heading for a 20% correction. A close below $1.10 signals a trend shift, while a drop under $1.03 confirms a bearish breakout to $0.88.

Despite these risks, Martinez remains optimistic about Cardano‚Äôs long-term outlook, forecasting a new all-time high of $6 between July and September 2025. This would represent a staggering 445% increase from current levels, driven by continued ecosystem growth and increasing adoption. Mixed signals in Cardano‚Äôs market activity Cardano‚Äôs derivatives market also paints a complex picture. Although trading volumes have remained robust, open interest has declined by 2.07%, standing at $1.10 billion. This drop suggests that some traders may be closing positions to secure profits. Meanwhile, options trading activity has plummeted by 92.94%, with volumes falling to $6,590, signaling reduced enthusiasm for ADA options. These mixed signals, combined with heightened market volatility, suggest ADA may face near-term resistance in its upward trajectory. While 2024 has tested Cardano with volatile price movements and unexpected hurdles, the network has achieved significant milestones in governance and ecosystem expansion. With increased whale activity, strong network development, and promising long-term forecasts, Cardano continues to position itself as a compelling investment despite short-term challenges.

As market enthusiasm grows, presales are becoming standout opportunities for significant gains, offering immense potential for early investors. However, with countless projects vying for attention, pinpointing the best crypto for the 2025 bull run is no easy task. This article simplifies the process by highlighting the top four presale projects poised to deliver exceptional returns. 1. BlockDAG: DAG-Driven Innovation with Presale Crossing $159M BlockDAG (BDAG) is hitting milestone after milestone in its presale journey, with over $159 million raised. The presale‚Äôs batch 26 is almost sold out at $0.0234 per BDAG coin. Between presale batch 1 and batch 26, BDAG has experienced a remarkable price surge of 2240%. This outstanding performance positions BlockDAG as a top choice for crypto enthusiasts, supported by its robust Layer 1 blockchain foundation. BlockDAG‚Äôs appeal lies in overcoming the blockchain trilemma‚Äîbalancing Security, Scalability, and Decentralization through its hybrid blockchain (Block) and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture. This approach enables rapid, low-cost transactions, making BlockDAG ideal for microtransactions and unlocking new business models within decentralized applications. The project‚Äôs success continues to attract major crypto players and blockchain developers, supported by constant updates like the completion of its Mainnet development, which is now in the audit phase. These milestones position BlockDAG as a key player in the crypto space, with rumors swirling about tier-1 exchange listings after the presale ends. Such listings could significantly boost BlockDAG‚Äôs visibility and drive mainstream adoption, potentially delivering a 30,000x ROI to early holders. As an established presale coin, BlockDAG‚Äôs successful trajectory and innovative roadmap upgrades make it one of the best cryptos for the 2025 bull run. 2. Crypto All-Stars: Innovative Staking Project Nears $9M Crypto All-Stars (STARS) has raised $8.7 million in its presale, nearing its $10 million target with $1.3 million left to secure. A key feature of this project is its staking program, providing an annual percentage yield (APY) designed for those interested in passive income opportunities. Investors can join the presale using BNB, USDT, or traditional bank cards. With its impressive progress, Crypto All-Stars positions itself as one of the best cryptos this year, drawing attention from holders aiming to prepare for the 2025 bull run. 3. Flockerz: Community-Driven Meme Coin Raises $4.1M Flockerz (FLOCK) has raised $4.1 million in its presale, positioning itself as a notable meme coin with a focus on decentralization. Token holders play a central role, voting on decisions such as token burns, marketing strategies, and potential feature developments, including game projects. Recent macroeconomic factors, such as the Federal Reserve's lowered interest rates and the SEC's approval of crypto spot ETFs, have increased liquidity in the cryptocurrency market, potentially benefiting meme coins like Flockerz. As the presale progresses, the project‚Äôs community-driven approach highlights its commitment to empowering holders to future direction. 4. Best Wallet: Mobile-First Crypto Solution Raises $2.2M Best Wallet (BEST) has raised $2.2 million in its public token sale, following a successful $1 million private funding round. The ICO is ongoing, and investors can participate using cryptocurrency or bank cards. Best Wallet plans to list its token, BEST, on an exchange after the ICO concludes, though specific details have not yet been disclosed. The wallet combines advanced features with a beginner-friendly design, offering a self-custodial experience that balances security and convenience. Its mobile-first approach ensures accessibility for users on the move. These attributes highlight Best Wallet as a secure option. Which Is the Best Crypto for the 2025 Bull Run? The crypto market is on the brink of transformative growth, with 2024's ongoing bull run poised to extend into the next year, driving interest in both established coins and innovative presales. Projects like BlockDAG, Crypto All-Stars, Flockerz, and Best Wallet are gaining attention. While Crypto All-Stars nears a $10M presale target, Flockerz focuses on community-led decentralization and Best Wallet secures $2.2M with its beginner-friendly design. BlockDAG, however, has broken a $159 million presale record with its innovative DAG architecture, achieving an exceptional balance of security, scalability, and decentralization that surpasses most traditional blockchain models. This momentum firmly positions BlockDAG as the best crypto for the 2025 bull run among the four presales discussed above.

The article uses her name, coupled with AI-generated graphics meant to mimic FOX News‚Äô official online news presentations. Through her official X account, Fox News journalist Eleanor Terrett has raised the alarm over a fraudulent attempt to dupe investors into buying a scam token. Eleanor cited pictures of a news report with her name and official Fox graphics promoting a fake BlackRock token presale. The deceptive article falsely claimed that BlackRock, the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, had launched the BlackRock Token (BRT), marking a supposed milestone in blockchain integration with traditional finance. Eleanor Terrett cautioned her followers against the scam, saying, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a fake article circulating using my name and official Fox graphics to promote a scam BlackRock token sale.‚Äù üö®PSA: There‚Äôs a fake article circulating using my name and official Fox graphics to promote a scam BlackRock token sale.

As seen in the pictures Terrett shared, the article urged readers not to ‚Äúmiss out on this historic opportunity‚Äù and directed them to a website to purchase the fraudulent tokens before the presale concluded. The site is meant to present itself as a legitimate source of information, offering step-by-step guides on how to acquire the tokens. It also detailed the tokenomics, utility, and benefits of the so-called BlackRock Token (BRT). Website visitors are greeted with baseless promises that buyers will receive a 20% annual staking token reward, referral bonuses and rewards, and VIP membership access, among others. Source: The fake BlackRock token site Additionally, the website includes fabricated updates on presale milestones and upcoming developments, further attempting to create a sense of legitimacy and urgency.

AI cryptocurrency scams are growing threats Over the years, scammers using artificial intelligence have significantly advanced their tactics to steal cryptocurrency from investors. In 2023 alone, crypto-related fraud complaints rose by 45%, resulting in over $5.6 billion in reported losses. AI technology allows scammers to monitor user behavior online, tailoring schemes to exploit individual investment patterns and cryptocurrency involvement. This personalization increases the chances of success as fraudsters craft convincing narratives targeting specific users. Moreover, AI enables mass automation, allowing scammers to reach thousands of potential victims simultaneously. Each unsuccessful attempt feeds back into machine learning algorithms, enabling real-time improvements to their strategies. This adaptability creates a dangerous dynamic where scams can evolve faster than security measures can respond. The financial implications of these scams are staggering. Research from the Motley Fool shows that In the first half of 2024, scams involving cryptocurrency as a payment method cost consumers $679 million. A notable example of this trend occurred in New Zealand, where a 72-year-old grandmother, Jill Creasy, lost $224,000 after falling victim to an AI-generated deepfake video. As reported by local news sources, the video featured a convincing likeness of Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, falsely promoting Bitcoin investments as a means for pensioners to boost their income. The scam, which circulated on Facebook in July, also involved fabricated endorsements from TVNZ broadcaster Jenny-May Clarkson and Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters. The deepfakes were so convincing that they prompted a public warning from New Zealand‚Äôs Financial Markets Authority weeks later.

Some of the best altcoin projects right now are Aave (AAVE), BlockDAG (BDAG), Bittensor (TAO), and Arbitrum (ARB) ‚Äî projects that promise faster, smarter, and more efficient blockchain alternatives. Whether it‚Äôs financial innovation, scalability, or advanced technology, these altcoins are carving their niches. While the market is volatile, these altcoins have created opportunities for early investors to gain significant returns during rebounds. Let's explore why these 4 best altcoin projects stand out in the market right now and have the potential to shape the future of cryptocurrency. 1. BlockDAG: Most Advanced Layer-1 Blockchain Project BlockDAG (BDAG) uses an innovative Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure alongside Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus to redefine blockchain scalability and security. Unlike traditional chains, its architecture enables simultaneous transaction validation, ensuring faster speeds and enhanced decentralization. This advanced design supports a growing user base and increasing demands, positioning BlockDAG as the world's most advanced layer-1 blockchain solution. Besides this, BlockDAG's presale has been a resounding success, raising over $159 million across 26 batches. The BDAG coin's price has surged by 2240%, rising from $0.001 to $0.0234, showcasing strong investor confidence. With its $600 million target in sight, the presale momentum underlines BlockDAG's immense growth potential, offering early adopters significant returns. Adding to its appeal, BlockDAG has introduced a 5-tier bonus system to reward its community. Starting with a 150% bonus on the first purchase and an impressive 170% bonus on the second one, the system progressively unlocks even greater rewards with each subsequent buy. This combination of innovative technology, financial success, and community-focused rewards makes BlockDAG a leading contender among the best altcoin projects for the next crypto bull run. 2. Aave (AAVE): Innovating DeFi Lending Protocols Aave is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies without intermediaries. It is well-known for introducing flash loans‚Äîinstant, uncollateralized loans that must be repaid within the same transaction block. This feature positions Aave as a considerable platform for liquidity management in DeFi. The AAVE token is integral to the ecosystem, providing governance rights and staking rewards. It allows users to vote on protocol upgrades and ensures network security. While Aave has seen significant adoption in the DeFi space, it faces increasing competition from newer protocols offering more scalability and advanced functionalities. 3. Bittensor (TAO): Decentralized AI Collaboration Bittensor combines blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI), creating a decentralized protocol for AI training and deployment. It rewards users who contribute computing resources to its network, aiming to build a scalable, collaborative ecosystem for machine learning. By integrating blockchain's transparency with AI's computational needs, Bittensor appeals to industries seeking decentralized solutions for data-driven applications. The TAO token powers the platform, enabling participants to stake, earn rewards, and access network features. As AI adoption grows, Bittensor highlights the potential of decentralized approaches to addressing computational challenges. 4. Arbitrum (ARB): Scaling Ethereum Efficiently Arbitrum is a layer-2 scaling solution that aims to address Ethereum's congestion and high transaction fees. It enhances efficiency by offloading computations and transaction processing from Ethereum's main chain, offering faster and cheaper interactions for decentralized applications (dApps). The ARB token facilitates governance within the network, allowing holders to influence protocol decisions. Arbitrum's compatibility with Ethereum-based dApps has driven its adoption among developers seeking scalability without compromising Ethereum's security. While it provides a much-needed solution to Ethereum's limitations, its relevance depends on how effectively it adapts to competition from emerging layer-2 technologies. The Best Altcoin Projects: Which One Are You Choosing? The altcoin market showcases the diverse applications of blockchain technology, from Aave's focus on DeFi lending to Bittensor's integration of AI and Arbitrum's efforts to enhance Ethereum's scalability. Each project addresses specific challenges and contributes to the evolution of decentralized systems. However, BlockDAG stands out for its innovative technology, robust presale success, and unique reward structures for its buyers. BlockDAG's unique hybrid technology delivers a comprehensive solution for scalability, security, and enhanced user engagement. Its impressive presale momentum and a 5-tiered bonus system highlight BlockDAG‚Äôs potential to outperform competitors in the next crypto bull run. For those seeking the best altcoin projects with proven growth and future promise, BlockDAG emerges as a highly compelling opportunity.

Be part of the future‚Äî secure your discounted tokens here . This article dives into why Solana's surge in popularity matters and how Lightchain AI positions itself to leapfrog limitations in traditional blockchain and take innovation to the next level. Together, they paint a vibrant picture of decentralized technology tailored for the modern investor. Why Solana Stands Out as an Investor Favorite Solana earned its place in the crypto hall of fame due to its speed and scalability. Sporting an impressive transaction throughput of over 65,000 TPS (transactions per second), Solana outranks legacy blockchains like Ethereum, especially concerning efficiency. The heart of its innovation? Proof of History (PoH)‚Äîa system that timestamps transactions, eliminating delays while enhancing transparency. For developers, Solana represents a goldmine. Its versatility has attracted decentralized apps (dApps), NFT marketplaces, and DeFi projects alike. For investors, Solana‚Äôs affordable fees and eco-friendly consensus model make it a winning bet. üå± Yet, as great as Solana is, there's always room for innovation, and that‚Äôs precisely where Lightchain AI takes charge. The Paradigm Shift with Lightchain AI Unlike Solana (or most blockchains for that matter), Lightchain AI doesn‚Äôt just deliver faster transaction speeds‚Äîit redefines what blockchain can do. At its core is a radically different consensus model called Proof of Intelligence (PoI). Where traditional PoS or PoW systems focus on cryptographic puzzles or staking, PoI rewards nodes for executing meaningful AI computations‚Äîtraining machine learning models, running complex AI inferences, and optimizing decentralization. Lightchain‚Äôs Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) acts as its brain‚Äîa computational layer that transforms the blockchain into an evolving ecosystem for decentralized AI. Here‚Äôs why this matters: Developers can deploy AI-powered decentralized apps (dApps) with unprecedented ease. It creates an auditable framework, so users always know how AI models process decisions, increasing transparency and trust. It merges governance with intelligence, ensuring voting systems evolve alongside AI developments. Solana made blockchain affordable and fast. Lightchain AI makes blockchain intelligent. Key Areas of Comparison Scalability & Speed Solana has rightfully been recognized for its high-speed capabilities, enabling over 65,000 TPS with low fees.

Some of the largest crypto exchanges such as Binance, ByBit, OKX and Bitget are prohibited from serving U.S. citizens. Binance.US, the American arm of the largest exchange, has been all but squeezed out as part of a bruising $4.3 billion settlement between its parent company and U.S. authorities.  In early 2022, Bitget, which has daily trading volume of around $8 billion, considered starting the process of acquiring U.S. state licenses, said the exchange‚Äôs CEO, Gracy Chen. But after the collapse of FTX, the climate didn‚Äôt look favorable, not to mention the ‚Äúridiculously high‚Äù legal costs, combined with the prospect of competing directly with Coinbase, Chen added.  Even with the regulatory clarity for crypto in the U.S. that Trump might bring as president, a tangle of state-based licenses and various federal authorities await new entrants. That said, Bitget has experience forging mutually beneficial relationships: A recent partnership with U.K. trading firm Archax enabled Bitget to become compliant with British financial promotions rules.  ‚ÄúWe are revisiting a U.S. strategy, although we have not decided on anything yet,‚Äù Chen said in an interview. ‚ÄúIf we had a local partner who has many of those licenses already, then we could do a joint venture, for example. So we don‚Äôt need to go through all the applications. We might take that approach, but it‚Äôs not decided yet.‚Äù  TON and Nigeria  Following the collapse of FTX and the regulatory clampdown on Binance, opportunities opened up for rival exchanges to pick up customers around the globe. Mobile app downloads tracked by business intelligence firm Sensor Tower and web traffic researcher SimilarWeb show big growth areas for several top exchanges in places like Russia, India and Nigeria, for instance.  Chen said her firm may have picked up some business that previously belonged to Binance. However, customer growth didn't just fall into Bitget‚Äôs lap, she said ‚Äî it was won over by being sharper and more innovative than the competition.  For example, Bitget made a $30 million investment in TON, the token of the blockchain network linked to the popular messaging app Telegram, which in turn led to a surge in Nigerian users. Many customers in the African country play games using TON and get tokens airdropped to their wallets, Chen said, and they needed easy access to deposit and trade these on an exchange. This was something Bitget was able to provide for Nigerians, Chen said.  ‚ÄúWe wanted to gain some of the TON users obviously, and this strategy worked really well from the Nigeria side,‚Äù Chen said. ‚ÄúThere was a period of time when we had more downloads in Nigeria than Google or TikTok.‚Äù  Nigeria is a country Chen has yet to visit, and because of the detainment of Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan, she won't be doing so for the time being.  ‚ÄúThere are some countries where we feel the government is perhaps not stable enough and for reasons of security no one from our team would fly there,‚Äù she said.  Russia, India, China  Chen said she was aware of some rival exchanges aggressively courting Russian users and influencers in the period after the Ukraine war began, especially during conferences in Dubai, for example. (Data from Sensor Tower shows Bybit had more than a million monthly active users in Russia in August.)  Bybit did not immediately reply to requests for comment about the number of Russian users on its platform.  Chen said Bitget had held back when it came to Russia. ‚ÄúStrategically, we thought we should stay away from the Russia/U.S. argument because sanctions were being imposed,‚Äù she said.  India, a market where Binance is re-established after receiving a fine this year, has not been a growth region for Bitget, mainly because of the lack of a clear regulatory framework, Chen said. ‚ÄúWe are working with the government and we have a few team members looking at India right now,‚Äù she said.  Large crypto exchanges do what they can to stop customers from restricted territories such as China or in some cases the U.S. from trading on their platforms illicitly. But it‚Äôs often the case that users in these excluded regions find ways to get around know-your-customer (KYC) checks, and may use virtual private networks (VPNs) to circumvent IP-blocking measures.  This type of activity happens a fair bit in China, Chen said, where users may have a passport or drivers' license attached to another country.  ‚ÄúI think all the major exchanges have business that comes from certain countries, such as China,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBecause it's such a big economy with so many retail users, it's just very hard to avoid all of them.‚Äù  Rising star  Chen, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate who was promoted from managing director and head of marketing to CEO of Bitget this year, is one of several Asian or Asian-American women steering the largest crypto companies; others include Binance co-founder Yi He, the partner of its former chief CZ; OKX President Hong Fang; and Helen Liu, the chief operating officer of Bybit.  In fact, Binance's He is an old friend who introduced Chen to crypto back in 2015.  ‚ÄúI know her pretty well. She was a bridesmaid at my wedding.

The rejection has raised questions about the strength of the bulls and whether they can regain control to steer the price back to higher levels. Bearish Build-Up On The 4-Hour Timeframe With bearish pressure mounting, the focus now shifts to key support zones and whether the bulls can hold firm against the downside movement, preventing XRP from experiencing a much deeper correction. Related Reading: XRP To Maintain Price Rally As Whales Reload Amidst Price Dip- Details On the 4-hour chart, XRP exhibits negative sentiment, attempting to drop below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) as it trends downward toward the $1.9 support level. Specifically, a continued descent to this support suggests that selling pressure is intensifying, and if the support fails to hold, the asset could experience more declines. Also, an analysis of the 4-hour chart reveals that the Composite Trend Oscillator‚Äôs trend line has fallen below the SMA line, signaling a potential shift in momentum as it edges closer to the zero line. This indicates a struggle to sustain upward movements and points to moderate bearish pressure, leading to a cautious market sentiment. If the signal line continues to drop, it may trigger heightened selling activity. Price Set Up For XRP On The 1-Day Timeframe On the daily chart, the crypto giant displays significant downward movement, highlighted by a bearish candlestick after a failed recovery attempt to surge toward its previous high of $2.9. The inability to sustain an uptrend implies a lack of buyer confidence and a prevailing pessimistic sentiment in the market. As XRP aims at the $1.9 support level, the pressure from sellers could intensify, raising concerns about the possibility of a breakdown. Finally, the 1-day Composite Trend Oscillator signals growing bearish momentum, with the indicator‚Äôs signal line dropping below the SMA after lingering in the overbought zone. This development suggests a possible shift in market dynamics as the overbought conditions may give way to increased selling pressure. A crossover of the signal line below the SMA is often interpreted as a bearish signal, indicating that the upside momentum could be weakening. Related Reading: XRP Price Steadies Above Support: Preparing for the Next Move? Conclusively, as XRP faces renewed negative pressure, key support levels become crucial in determining its next move. Meanwhile, the first level to watch is $1.9, which could act as an initial buffer against further declines. A sustained break below this level might open the door for a deeper drop toward $1.7, a region of significant historical activity. If bearish momentum persists, the $1.3 mark could serve as the last line of defense before a broader selloff ensues.

37425039,https://crypto.news/?p=14317632,1733754273,6 tokens that could help build a 7-figure crypto portfolio in the next 6 months,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum lead, but 6 altcoins could grow your portfolio to 7 figures in 6 months. Table of Contents Rexas Finance Aptos SUI Pepe Coin Solana Toncoin Conclusion Cryptocurrency is one of the most rewarding assets for investors who see its potential. While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate, lower-cap altcoins are growing and have greater potential to yield huge gains quickly. This post will list six tokens with distinct traits and development potential that might boost your cryptocurrency portfolio to seven figures in six months. You might also like: Future of asset tokenization: Rexas Finance poised to lead $16 trillion market Rexas Finance Rexas Finance , a project that intends to tokenize and manage real-world assets (RWAs), has shown potential with its rapid presale. Starting on September 8, the presale fast passed through eight stages, and currently, in stage 9, RXS has risen 316% from $0.03 to $0.125. The presale has sold 310 million tokens and raised $23.3 million, with plans to launch the token for $0.20 on at least three tier-1 exchanges after all phases. Rexas Finance‚Äôs asset tokenization vision sets it apart. By transforming real estate, art, and commodities into digital tokens, Rexas allows fractional ownership, liquidity, and international investor access. Retail and institutional investors are showing interest in this novel method, and as the presale gains momentum, many analysts anticipate a significant price increase on key exchanges. Along with tokenization, the project offers a complete ecosystem, including the Rexas Token Builder and Launchpad, which let users design and launch tokens without technical expertise. Rexas AI Shield improves security, and Rexas Treasury optimizes yield farming with decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. These technologies enable seamless, safe, and efficient digital money transactions. The ongoing giveaway also makes Rexas Finance appealing. The top 20 winners of the $1 million sweepstakes will get $50,000 in RXS tokens. This event boosts user engagement and project awareness as the presale winds down. Based on the project‚Äôs presale performance and intentions to list on tier-1 exchanges, analysts expect RXS to easily exceed $10 once listed on major exchanges. This potential upside and unique value proposition make RXS a top option for growing a seven-figure portfolio in six months. Aptos Aptos (APT) is becoming a Layer-1 blockchain to watch in 2024. Retail and institutional investors are interested in the network‚Äôs rising TVL and strong developer environment. APT broke $13, hitting new records. As decentralized finance grows, analysts expect APT to rise. If the trend continues with its tremendous scalability, inexpensive fees, and good development tools, Aptos might reach $20 in six months. SUI SUI has been exhibiting strong bullish momentum, lately breaking its all-time high and moving toward $5. The network‚Äôs performance has been boosted by rising adoption, with TVL exceeding $2.9 billion. Analysts have compared its current price behavior to Solana‚Äôs early years, pointing to a potential parabolic surge that may propel SUI to $6 or higher in the coming months. The cryptocurrency is gaining traction as a leading contender for exponential growth with increased speculation about an ETF listing for SUI. Pepe Coin Pepe Coin (PEPE) , recognized for its meme-based appeal, is gaining traction, aided by whale accumulation. PEPE has increased by 120% in the last month, thanks to whales purchasing more than 10 trillion tokens. This amount of accumulation has traditionally preceded major price rallies. Analysts believe that PEPE will have a 7x increase, reaching as high as $0.00015 in the coming months. Increased market demand and restricted exchange supply make PEPE a meme currency with significant upside potential. Solana Solana (SOL) has recently gained bullish momentum, mirroring the overall market‚Äôs increase. Sol is trading at $235 right now, up 45% over last month. With Bitcoin exceeding $100k, experts think Solana is set for huge increases; price forecasts over the next six months top $500. Solana‚Äôs high transaction per second (TPS) and rapid popularity make it a leading candidate for significant price gain. Toncoin Toncoin (TON) is another Layer-1 token that is exhibiting significant bullish trends. TON is currently trading at $7.08, reaching its all-time high of $8.24. With rising open interest and trading volumes, analysts expect that TON will shortly break over this hurdle and reach $10. The rapid acceptance of TON within Telegram and the expanding derivatives market for TON are expected to boost its prospects over the next six months. Conclusion The current market dynamics create an intriguing environment for cryptocurrency investors. Tokens such as Aptos, SUI, Pepe Coin, Solana, and Toncoin have huge growth potential, with analysts predicting big gains over the next six months. However, Rexas Finance distinguishes itself with its revolutionary asset tokenization technology, strong presale success, and expanding market presence. With its imminent exchange listings and the potential for spectacular price increases, RXS presents an excellent opportunity to construct a seven-figure portfolio in the next six months.

Is Cryptocurrencies Being Given the Green Light? Here Are the Details,"Iran is moving to regulate cryptocurrencies rather than impose restrictions as the government seeks to embrace the benefits of digital assets, according to Iranian Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance Abdolnaser Hemmati. Iran Turns to Crypto Regulation to Reap Economic Benefits Key Points Policy Shift: Speaking at a national event on Saturday, Hemmati stressed that the government‚Äôs focus is to leverage the positive aspects of cryptocurrencies while mitigating their potential negative economic impact. Jurisdiction: Digital assets will be regulated under the jurisdiction of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), which is preparing new policies for the sector. Economic Potential: Hemmati highlighted the potential of cryptocurrencies to boost youth employment, help circumvent US sanctions, and align Iran‚Äôs financial ecosystem with the global economy. New Regulatory Framework The Central Bank of Iran has released a document outlining upcoming cryptocurrency regulations, as reported by state-run Nour News. The framework aims to: Supporting crypto investors in complying with local tax and anti-money laundering (AML) laws. Developing policies that integrate cryptocurrency use into the broader economy. Economist Mohammad Sadegh Alhosseini estimates that Iranian investors currently hold between $30 billion and $50 billion worth of crypto assets, equivalent to about a third of Iran‚Äôs gold market, underscoring the growing importance of digital currencies in the country‚Äôs financial world. The announcement coincides with renewed optimism for cryptocurrency regulation in the United States. US President-elect Donald Trump recently appointed pro-crypto officials, including longtime blockchain advocate Paul Atkins, as the new chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This development could signal a global shift towards more favorable regulatory environments for digital assets. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Iran Changes Strategy!

The buys were made over the week ended Dec. 8 and the firm paid an average price of $98,783 each, totaling $2.1 billion, according to a Monday regulatory filing. It funded the acquisition by selling roughly $2.13 billion shares during the same period. The company now has an additional $9.19 billion remaining from its previously existing $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) share sales facility.  The latest buying spree brought the firm's BTC holdings to 423,650, or nearly $42 billion worth at current prices. Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy now holds more than 2% of the 21 million bitcoin that can ever exist.  The purchases took place and perhaps contributed to bitcoin's price action as the crypto crossed above $100,000 last week for the first time in its history with significant U.S. investor activity bidding spot prices higher. Alongside, U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs also saw massive inflows raking in $2.73 billion in fresh funds last week, data compiled by Farside Investors showed.  MicroStrategy shares were down 1% to $395 in premarket trading alongside a modest decline in bitcoin prices to $99,000.

While Ripple XRP has long dominated discussions for its role in revolutionizing cross-border payments, Lightchain AI is now entering the arena with groundbreaking technology. üöÄ Lightchain AI's Presale is NOW LIVE! This revolutionary blockchain project merges artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain via cutting-edge innovations like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). Take advantage of discounted tokens and join the future of decentralized AI technology. Click Lightchain AI Presale to learn more! This article explores how Lightchain AI and Ripple XRP stack up in technology, potential use cases, and future price projections to answer one burning question for investors and blockchain enthusiasts alike‚Äîwhich project will redefine blockchain as we know it? Lightchain AI Takes Center Stage Lightchain AI brings something truly unique to blockchain technology by fusing it with artificial intelligence. At the heart of Lightchain's mission is Proof of Intelligence (PoI), a groundbreaking consensus mechanism that goes beyond the inefficiencies of traditional Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS). Instead, PoI rewards nodes for valuable AI computations like machine learning model training‚Äîan innovation that prioritizes real-world utility. Complementing this is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). Unlike traditional blockchain environments, AIVM enables smart contracts tailored for AI tasks, such as neural network optimization. Lightchain AI transforms blockchain from a transactional ledger to a hub of intelligent computation. Key Features of Lightchain AI Proof of Intelligence (PoI) - Rewards meaningful AI computations while securing the blockchain. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) - Executes advanced AI models on-chain, creating a seamless decentralized AI ecosystem. Transparency - Every AI decision is accountable and auditable, fostering trust across the ecosystem. Current Price of Lightchain AI Token (LCAI): $0.003 Join the Lightchain AI Presale here üåê Ripple XRP‚Äôs Focus on Payments Ripple XRP has become synonymous with fast and cost-effective cross-border payment solutions. It leverages blockchain technology to eliminate intermediaries in banking and financial transactions, creating near-instant settlement on a global scale. Ripple‚Äôs Market Position Ripple has consistently been a top cryptocurrency by market cap, and its partnerships with financial institutions worldwide are a testament to its influence. RippleNet, the company's blockchain network, has successfully replaced outdated SWIFT systems for many banks thanks to its speed and scalability. Key Features of Ripple XRP: On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) - Enables instant cross-border transactions without pre-funded accounts. High Scalability - Processes up to 1,500 transactions per second. Financial Connectivity - Relationships with over 300+ financial institutions in 40+ countries. Current Price of Ripple XRP Token (XRP): $2.59 The Head-to-Head Comparison Innovation Potential Lightchain AI‚Äôs focus on blending AI with blockchain puts it in a league of its own when it comes to innovation. Its PoI incentivizes computational intelligence, while Ripple XRP remains looped into financial services. However, Ripple wins when it comes to seasoned market presence. Advantage üëâ Lightchain AI in innovation; Ripple XRP in maturity. Use Cases Ripple XRP dominates fintech and payments, whereas Lightchain AI extends blockchain‚Äôs relevance into untapped areas like AI development, dApp creation, and decentralized governance. Advantage üëâ Lightchain AI for versatility; Ripple for specialization. Pricing and Accessibility Lightchain AI tokens are priced at $0.003, offering a high upside for early investors during the presale stage. Ripple XRP, on the other hand, trades significantly higher but offers stability for long-term holdings. Advantage üëâ Lightchain AI for new investors; Ripple for limited risk tolerance. Price Predictions: Weekly Projections Lightchain LCAI With strong early traction and increasing interest in AI-blockchain projects, Lightchain AI could see its price rise steadily during the presale and early adoption phases. Week 1 - $0.0042 Week 2 - $0.0056 Week 3 - $0.0071 Week 4 - $0.009 The presale pricing offers smaller investors a high-reward opportunity. Join the presale today .

37424906,https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-120k-by-christmas,1733753968,$120K by Xmas: Why another bitcoin run could be in the cards,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Need some holiday cheer this Monday morning? Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôve got you: Bitcoin at $120,000 could be a thing by Christmas. Or so Steven McClurg, Canary Capital CEO, thinks. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of appetite‚Äù for bitcoin and bitcoin ETFs, which could fuel the run, he added. I‚Äôm not going to sugarcoat it. That type of run looks tough right now. Over the weekend, bitcoin mostly sat below six figures, unable to take ‚Äî and hold ‚Äî $100k. But McClurg told me all of the work he‚Äôs done has led him to believe that a rally could happen. And even if $120,000 remains elusive into the next year, he‚Äôs hopeful that it‚Äôs a matter of when we see it rather than if. And, if we don‚Äôt see that number by Christmas, he‚Äôs fairly certain we‚Äôll see it before we ring in the new year. Keep in mind, McClurg‚Äôs price target is fairly similar (a mere $5k short) to Ledn‚Äôs John Glover‚Äôs PT. Just look at how far we‚Äôve come this year As I wrote last week , some analysts are concerned that late January could mark a turning point for bitcoin. K33‚Äôs Vetle Lunde, in a note, wrote: ‚ÄúThe average distance between BTC‚Äôs first cycle ATH and its last ATH during its past three cycles is 318 days. Under the assumption that average trajectories hold, a peak would occur on January 17. This is not unlikely, given that Trump‚Äôs inauguration will take place on January 20.‚Äù McClurg doesn‚Äôt think we‚Äôll see the market peak next month. Instead, he reckons it could last anywhere from June to October, which is specifically based on the fact that bitcoin historically runs for roughly six months after a new president takes office. When I asked whether or not the four-year cycle will hold moving forward, McClurg said yes‚Ä¶with a twist. ‚ÄúI believe that cycle will still be there, but that being said, bitcoin will begin to follow the broader macroeconomic cycle closer over time than the typical four-year cycle,‚Äù he told me. Now this is important to note for a few reasons: We have a few macro events incoming. Not only are we getting the all-important November CPI this week, but we also have the Federal Reserve meeting next week. Both of which could have a positive (or negative, depending on the data and what‚Äôs said) impact for bitcoin. It seems like it‚Äôll be par for the course to see continued fluctuation between the upper $90k‚Äôs and $100k. Still, who knows. The market could feel merry and bright in light of the holidays, and a $120k run is just around the corner. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

37425046,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624878,1733753957,Ethereum spot ETF weekly inflows hit record $837M,"Ethereum spot ETFs saw huge inflows in the last week, bringing in a total of $837 million. BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA was the biggest gainer of the week with $573 million. Ethereum ETFs had their best day on record on December 5 with $428.5 million invested into the funds. The new high beat out the previous record of $332.9 million which it set on November 29. These inflows reflect investors‚Äô increasing confidence in Ethereum as a long-term store of value. While the Ethereum spot ETFs struggled for months to attract investors‚Äô attention, especially compared to their BTC counterparts, the landscape is entirely different now. Institutions drive 10-day ETF inflow streak ETH ETF inflows are soaring driven by institutional adoption. According to SosoValue , ten days of healthy inflows have proven Ethereum ETFs‚Äô durability and appeal for diverse investment portfolios. Weekly net inflow into ETH ETFs. Source: Sosovalue Last week, Bitcoin spot ETFs had their second-largest net inflows ever at $2.73 billion. BlackRock‚Äòs IBIT fund led inflows with $2.63 billion. These data demonstrate Bitcoin‚Äôs ETF dominance. This comes at a time when Bitcoin‚Äôs price hit an all-time high of $100,350, breaking the $100,000 mark for the first time. ETH‚Äôs price has also risen, reaching over $4,000, the highest since March 2024. This rise has led to an improved ETH/BTC ratio, which has surged by 14.5% in the past month. Analysts predict that this trend could continue over the next six to twelve months as Ethereum continues gaining strength against BTC. Investors embrace crypto ETFs as demand for regulated digital asset exposure grows The record-breaking inflows into the ETFs demonstrate extended belief in its status as digital gold. Due to regulated exposure, institutional investors increasingly embrace Bitcoin ETFs, expanding this market segment. With the recent increase in Ethereum and Bitcoin prices, the trend of spot ETFs may be considered significant in integrating digital assets into mainstream investment portfolios. Notably, since Donald Trump became president-elect, about $10 billion has been poured into US exchange-traded funds, which are invested directly in Bitcoin. Several analysts believe his embrace of the crypto sector heralds a boom for the market.

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address ‚Äì C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/pepe-maga-pepemaga-solana-memecoin-will-explode-18000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37429655,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/can-lightchain-ai-outpace-solana-sol-blockchain-experts-share-their-insights,1733753858,Can Lightchain AI Outpace Solana SOL? Blockchain Experts Share Their Insights,"The blockchain world is a battleground, with projects fighting tooth and nail to claim the throne of innovation, scalability, and utility. In one corner, we have Solana (SOL), the reigning champ basking in its well-deserved spotlight. On the other, enter Lightchain AI (LCAI), the bold new contender combining blockchain and AI like peanut butter and jelly‚Äîonly smarter. While Solana enjoys its moment of glory, Lightchain AI is sneaking up, ready to shake things up. Experts are starting to whisper: Could Lightchain AI outshine Solana in adoption, utility, and even market cap? In this article, we dive into the juicy details‚Äîexpert takes, standout features, and what the future might hold for these two blockchain heavyweights. Let the showdown begin! Solana: The High-Speed Blockchain Pioneer Solana‚Äôs Strengths Solana is known for its blazing-fast transaction speeds and super low costs, thanks to its unique mix of Proof of History (PoH) and Proof of Stake (PoS). With the ability to handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), it‚Äôs become a go-to blockchain for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Web3 apps. Developer Ecosystem: Solana has an awesome community of developers creating everything from DEXs to NFT marketplaces. Scalability: Its Sealevel parallel processing lets the network handle big workloads with ease. Low Transaction Fees: Solana‚Äôs super low fees make it perfect for apps with lots of transactions. Challenges Facing Solana Despite its advantages, Solana faces significant challenges: Network Reliability: Repeated outages have undermined trust in Solana's infrastructure. Centralization Concerns: A limited number of validators raises questions about its decentralization, a core principle of blockchain. Technological Stagnation: Solana‚Äôs PoH innovation, once revolutionary, now risks being overshadowed by more advanced consensus mechanisms like Lightchain AI‚Äôs Proof of Intelligence (PoI). Lightchain AI: The New Frontier of Blockchain Innovation What Sets Lightchain AI Apart? Lightchain AI is transforming the blockchain world by blending cutting-edge artificial intelligence directly into its ecosystem. With two groundbreaking innovations, it‚Äôs redefining what‚Äôs possible in the blockchain space: Proof of Intelligence (PoI): Move over, Solana. PoI takes blockchain to the next level by rewarding nodes for performing real-world AI tasks, like training and optimizing models. This isn‚Äôt just a blockchain‚Äîit‚Äôs a productive powerhouse driving advancements in AI. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): Think of the AIVM as a turbocharged engine for executing AI tasks on the blockchain. It empowers developers to build scalable, AI-driven decentralized applications (dApps) like never before. Why Lightchain AI Stands Out By putting AI at the heart of its design, Lightchain AI opens doors to groundbreaking possibilities across industries: Healthcare: Revolutionize diagnostics and accelerate drug discovery with predictive AI. Finance: Build smarter DeFi platforms with AI-powered risk assessments and investment insights. Supply Chains: Achieve real-time optimization and unparalleled transparency through AI analytics. Lightchain AI isn‚Äôt just changing the game‚Äîit‚Äôs creating a brand-new one. Expert Insights: Can Lightchain AI Surpass Solana? The Case for Lightchain AI Blockchain experts argue that Lightchain AI is poised to outpace Solana due to its technological superiority and real-world relevance: Productivity and Innovation: By focusing on AI computations, Lightchain AI creates tangible value beyond simple transaction validation, unlike Solana‚Äôs limited scope. Scalability for Future Needs: The AIVM ensures that Lightchain AI is not only scalable but also adaptable to evolving technological demands. Sustainability: PoI eliminates wasteful computations, making Lightchain AI an eco-friendly alternative in a world increasingly focused on green technology. The Case for Solana While Solana faces criticism, its strong community and established presence cannot be ignored: Ecosystem Maturity: Solana‚Äôs extensive ecosystem of DeFi, NFTs, and gaming projects gives it a significant first-mover advantage. Network Effect: The large number of projects and users on Solana creates a self-reinforcing cycle of growth. Institutional Backing: Solana‚Äôs backing by major investors ensures continuous funding and development. Price Predictions and Market Growth Solana‚Äôs Outlook Short-Term: Analysts predict Solana could reach $300-$400 by the end of 2024, assuming improvements in network stability and decentralization. Long-Term: If Solana resolves its current challenges, it could surpass $500 by 2026. However, competition from innovative platforms like Lightchain AI may hinder this growth. Lightchain AI‚Äôs Outlook Short-Term: With a presale price of just $0.003, experts project Lightchain AI could reach $1-$5 by the end of 2024, driven by its unique use cases and growing adoption. Long-Term: As industries adopt Lightchain AI‚Äôs technology, prices could soar to $50 or more by 2026, rivaling or even surpassing Solana in market cap. Why Lightchain AI Could Outpace Solana Technological SuperiorityLightchain AI‚Äôs PoI and AIVM innovations give it a competitive edge by offering real-world utility and advanced scalability. Solana‚Äôs reliance on outdated PoH technology limits its long-term potential. Broader ApplicationsWhile Solana focuses on DeFi and NFTs, Lightchain AI targets diverse industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance. This broad scope ensures sustained demand and relevance. Eco-Friendly DesignIn a world increasingly concerned about sustainability, Lightchain AI‚Äôs energy-efficient PoI mechanism positions it as a preferred choice among environmentally conscious developers and investors. Community and GovernanceLightchain AI‚Äôs decentralized governance empowers its community, fostering trust and long-term engagement. Solana‚Äôs centralization, by contrast, risks alienating its user base. Future-Proof VisionLightchain AI‚Äôs focus on continuous innovation ensures it remains relevant as blockchain and AI technologies evolve. Solana, without significant updates, risks being left behind. Takeaways: Who Will Lead the Blockchain Race? While Solana has solidified its place as a major blockchain player, its limitations‚Äîsuch as centralization and network instability‚Äîmay prevent it from maintaining its dominance. Lightchain AI, with its innovative approach and real-world applications, is poised to disrupt the industry and potentially outpace Solana in terms of adoption, utility, and market cap.

In August, Bukele revealed in an X post that Turkish company Yilport Holdings made the largest private investment in El Salvador‚Äôs history, around $1.6 billion, and will develop the port at the proposed Bitcoin City site in La Uni√≥n, a municipality in La Uni√≥n Department of El Salvador.

On one hand, the move generated global headlines, attracted crypto enthusiasts, and bolstered Bukele‚Äôs image as a disruptor. Bitcoin‚Äôs price surge to over $100,000 this year has also boosted the value of the country‚Äôs cryptocurrency reserves. https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1822974421142782176 According to Bukele‚Äôs recent post on X, El Salvador‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings are now worth over $550 million, reflecting a 127% gain. ‚ÄúYou can call it our first #Bitcoin piggy bank. It‚Äôs not much, but it‚Äôs honest work,‚Äù he wrote. For many Salvadorans, Bitcoin hasn‚Äôt quite lived up to its expectations. Even though it‚Äôs legally recognized, most people still prefer the U.S. dollar for their transactions. Many cite Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility and their lack of trust in it as reasons for sticking with the dollar. A survey from Francisco Gavidia University in San Salvador, conducted in 2024, found that only 7.5% of the 1,224 participants actually use Bitcoin for transactions. Details on IMF deal According to the Financial Times, the IMF loan deal would lead to changes in El Salvador‚Äôs Bitcoin policy, removing requirements for businesses that required them to accept BTC as a legal tender and making these payments optional. The government has also agreed to cut its budget deficit by 3.5% of GDP over the next three years, fight corruption, and increase foreign reserves from $11 billion to $15 billion. The approval timeline is still uncertain, and it‚Äôs unclear if the changes mentioned above will be enough. However, the IMF loan could lead to another $1 billion from the World Bank and $1 billion from the Inter-American Development Bank, helping the country rejoin global financial markets. Economic revival amid controversy Bukele has maintained strong domestic support, buoyed by a sharp drop in crime rates following his crackdown on violent gangs. His re-election earlier this year with 85% of the vote might reflect his popularity, though his administration has faced criticism abroad for alleged human rights violations and corruption. While the Biden administration initially criticized Bukele‚Äôs policies, recent months have seen a shift toward closer ties. El Salvador‚Äôs sovereign bonds rallied 22% earlier this year, closing the steep discount that previously alarmed investors. Bukele linked the bond rally to Bitcoin‚Äôs rise, calling it ‚Äúthe first time in history that Bitcoin has driven sovereign bonds up in traditional markets.‚Äù Bitcoin‚Äôs surge to $100k Bitcoin‚Äôs skyrocket price surge has definitely played its role in softening criticism of El Salvador‚Äôs crypto gamble. The crypto‚Äôs value boost provided a windfall for the government, helping to bolster reserves and partially vindicating Bukele‚Äôs strategy of buying Bitcoin during market dips. BTC Price Chart | Source: crypto.news Still, the country‚Äôs broader economy remains sort of fragile. With GDP growth slowing and public debt elevated, analysts caution that Bitcoin‚Äôs gains alone might not be enough to resolve structural economic challenges. The IMF loan agreement, if finalized, would certainly mark a big step in addressing these issues, albeit with conditions that require scaling back some of the crypto ambitions that first put El Salvador on the global stage. The IMF has yet to publicly comment on the ongoing negotiations. For Bukele, the deal represents both a retreat from his Bitcoin bet and an opportunity to reset the country‚Äôs financial trajectory.

37426169,https://invezz.com/?p=2379575,1733752835,Australia‚Äôs stricter crypto rules trigger blockchain firm decline,"Blockchain and cryptocurrency-focused firms accounted for the largest share of fintech shutdowns in Australia in 2024. According to a December 9 report from professional services firm KPMG, the blockchain and cryptocurrency space were ‚Äúthe hardest hit in the Australian fintech landscape‚Äù in 2024. Roughly 7% of fintech companies headquartered in the country ceased operations between 2023 and 2024, amounting to a total of 60 firms shutting down. The total number of independent fintech firms dropped to 767 in December 2024 from a high of over 800 in 2022, the report added. Firms belonging to the blockchain and crypto sector accounted for 14% of the total number of firms that exited the Australian fintech space this year. Currently, the nation houses 74 active firms in this sector including prominent firms like SwyftX and CoinSpot. According to KPMG, the primary driver behind this drop was the ‚Äúglobal shift in spotlight from blockchain technology to AI,‚Äù with investors ‚Äúdeploying capital in the increasingly important AI space to convert their businesses into forward-looking and AI-capable‚Äù enterprises. However, KPMG researchers believe this downturn is momentary, pointing to positive catalysts that will help reverse this trend in the future. Specifically, the report cited the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the United States as a potential catalyst for revitalising the blockchain sector. Earlier this year, Monochrome Asset Management‚Äôs IBTC fund became the first ETF in the country to directly hold Bitcoin. Among other potential drivers, KPMG noted that expected rate cuts across several global markets, also anticipated in Australia, ‚Äúcould free up capital that has been sitting on the sideline‚Äù and make risk assets like cryptocurrencies a more viable investment option. Australia increases crypto oversight Amid this backdrop, regulators in Australia are looking to ramp up oversight of the crypto sector, focusing on areas like taxation and investor protection. Last month, Australia‚Äôs treasury department published a consultation paper on whether it should implement the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development‚Äôs (OECD) Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework that seeks to establish guidelines for reporting and collecting tax data on crypto assets. If implemented, the guidelines will require crypto exchanges in the nation to report crypto transactions to tax authorities. More recently, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ( ASIC ) issued Consultation Paper 381, constituting plans to address regulatory gaps in the crypto industry and enhance investor protection measures. The regulations would classify crypto assets as financial products and regulate service providers like exchanges and other related platforms under the Australian Financial Services Licence and Market Licence frameworks. Several market participants have raised concerns that stricter regulations could compel crypto pioneers to move to offshore markets. Meanwhile, in the coming year, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) has vowed to crack down on scams and money laundering activities fuelled by cryptocurrency ATMs in Australia. As previously reported by Invezz, AUSTRAC has created an internal task force that will ensure crypto ATM operators in the country comply with anti-money laundering laws and are subject to enforcement action and penalties for non-compliance.

Bitcoin's price movements are influenced by its four-year halving cycle, showing resilience and potential for long-term growth. Supply and demand dynamics are crucial to Bitcoin's success, suggesting it will be a significant market outperformer in 2025. The article will delve into Bitcoin's supply/demand factors to explain its future market potential. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 ( SPY ) and all other asset classes since its inception in 2009. Bitcoin was priced at zero when it began, and the price recently surpassed $100,000 before pulling back a bit. Bitcoin's rise over this long-term 15-year period was marked by large boom and bust markets based on its halving cycle, which occurs every four years. Since it lasted for 15 years and increased to all-time highs at each halving cycle, I can argue that Bitcoin has staying power with the potential to continue to make higher highs over the long term. Bitcoin's success comes down to supply and demand, which the price of anything is based upon. In this article, I will explain how Bitcoin is likely to be a significant market outperformer in 2025. Bitcoin's Supply/Demand Dynamics Bitcoin faces positive supply/demand dynamics as we finish 2024 and begin 2025. As for the supply, a maximum of 21 million Bitcoin can be mined . Therefore, Bitcoin's limited supply is positive for its underlying price, since the crypto cannot be diluted with excess supply beyond the maximum of 21 million coins. Having limited supply is likely to keep upward pressure on the price of Bitcoin over the long term. Bitcoin is experiencing demand from multiple sources. Each halving cycle which occurs every four years tends to increase demand for Bitcoin as the price rallies significantly. Bitcoin's recent halving took place on April 19, 2024. The price of Bitcoin was in the low $60k range at that time. Investor demand led the price to surpass $100,000 in November 2024. 1. Bitcoin ETF Approvals Strong demand for Bitcoin actually began before the 2024 halving took place. The price of Bitcoin bottomed near $15k in November 2022. This was after reaching a previous high of about $69k in November 2021. Demand increased from here in anticipation of the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, which eventually occurred in January 2024. Now that the ETFs are approved, it has created demand from institutional investors, exchanges, and from retail investors of all sizes who can now purchase Bitcoin like stocks in regular brokerage accounts. Inflows to Bitcoin ETFs amounted to a monthly record $6.4 billion in November 2024 . Bitcoin ETFs experienced $1.5 billion in inflows in just the first week of December 2024 as the price surpassed $100k. 2. Halving Cycle/Technical Perspective The demand for Bitcoin was also accelerated from the anticipation of the 2024 halving cycle and a technical bottom, indicated by a bullish divergence between the bitcoin price and the RSI and MACD indicators. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) Weekly Chart with RSI and MACD (Trading View) Bitcoin's weekly chart above shows the price bottoming at about $15,000 back in 2022. The bottom was marked by the bullish divergence as the price decreased from July 2022 to November 2022. At the same time, the RSI and MACD indicators increased. This classic bullish divergence marked the bottom of the bear cycle. The beginning of the new bull cycle was confirmed in 2023 as the price made higher highs and higher lows. I zoomed out to the monthly chart below to show where we are now and where we could be going based on past cycles. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) Monthly Chart (Trading View) Bitcoin's monthly chart above, where each candle represents an entire month of price action, shows how high the purple RSI indicator (middle of the chart) goes at each peak for every halving cycle. In each previous cycle, the RSI increased to above 90 in the overbought territory. Currently, Bitcoin increased into the overbought territory, but is still in the $70s range. So, there is most likely more room for the price to go in this cycle since there are multiple demand factors driving the price up. 3. The potential for The United States to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve Donald Trump's advisors have been discussing the possibility of creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve . The state of Pennsylvania has the same proposal for a strategic Bitcoin reserve. This can drive large demand from not only the United States purchasing, but from other countries and other states if the U.S. and PA set the example. If the United States and PA establish Bitcoin reserves, it could lead other countries and states to establish them as well. 4. Companies buying and holding Bitcoin MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), led by Michael Saylor, has been the leader in buying Bitcoin . MSTR now has over $25 billion in Bitcoin holdings. Other companies that hold over $1 billion worth of Bitcoin include: MARA Holdings (formerly Marathon Digital Holdings) ( MARA ) with about $2.7 billion, Galaxy Digital Holdings ( OTCPK:BRPHF ) with $1.5 billion, and Tesla ( TSLA ) with $1.15 billion. There are other companies that are getting close to holding $1 billion worth of Bitcoin, and many holding multiple-millions worth of it. This trend is likely to continue as the price of Bitcoin increases and companies learn to use the crypto to get a good return on their investments over the long term. The increases in companies buying large quantities of Bitcoin can help drive demand and the price higher. The Common Denominator for Bitcoin's Demand Bitcoin is really becoming a replacement for gold as a store of value. The reason for that is because Bitcoin's price appreciation significantly outperformed gold over the long term. Bitcoin's price went from zero to $100,000 in 15 years, while the price of gold increased from about $900 to $2,651 over the same period. Those who want to buy Bitcoin are buying it because they expect the value to increase over time. That is true for retail investors, institutional investors, governments, and companies. In general, people don't use gold to buy goods & services in present times. Most people don't use Bitcoin to buy goods & services, either. That tends to be the argument from those who don't believe in Bitcoin. They don't see Bitcoin being used widely as a currency, so they dismiss it as an investment. I think Bitcoin needs to be thought of as a store of value, which it has demonstrated over the last 15 years. Data by YCharts Gold was given to baby Jesus as a gift over 2,000 years ago, so the yellow metal does have staying power. However, if Jesus was born today, one of the wise men might consider gifting him Bitcoin for its superior price appreciation potential over the long term. Just as the masses of people gave gold value over time, the masses of people today are giving Bitcoin value. Bitcoin demonstrated over the past 15 years that it is more than just a fad and that it has staying power. As a result, demand for Bitcoin can continue to increase over the long term. Bitcoin's Target Price and Peak For 2025 There were three previous halving cycles before the current fourth cycle. The 1st cycle lasted 1,148 days from the bottom to the top of the market, according to Bitcoin's price. The 2nd and 3rd halving cycles lasted 1,064 days each from the bottom of the market to the top. The 1st cycle was most likely skewed because Bitcoin had more volatility as a new asset class back then. So, an educated guess on the current cycle's top could be similar to the last two cycles at 1,064 days from Bitcoin's low price to the peak price. Bitcoin's price was about $15,400 at the bottom of the current cycle on November 21, 2022. So, if we count 1,064 days since that bottom, the peak of the current cycle could occur around October 2025. As for the price target, my realistic estimate is for Bitcoin to reach approximately $154,000 by about October 2025. This is based on the price reaching the 2.618 Fibonacci level. The price did surpass the 1.618 Fibonacci level at $102,000 before pulling back below the $100k mark. There are always pullbacks along the way to the peak price. The average pullback in the 2023 to 2024 Bitcoin bull market has been 23%. The rallies following pullbacks of more than 20% in this time period have been 54%. So, there is likely to be plenty of volatility along the way even during bull markets. My thesis for the $154,000 price target is that the current supply/demand dynamics and the technical price perspective will drive the price towards the 2.618 Fibonacci level after the $102,000 or 1.618 Fibonacci level holds as support. This would be a 54% gain from the current price of about $100,000. This would significantly outperform Wall Street's top strategists' projected return of 10% for the S&P 500 in 2025 . The multiple factors influencing demand for Bitcoin have a good possibility of driving the price towards the 2.618 Fibonacci level. Of course, there are no guarantees that this will occur. With all of the factors discussed here, it does look like a realistic possibility.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4743011-bitcoin-significantly-outperform-stock-market-2025?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37424434.jpeg

This emphasis on privacy boosts user confidence and strengthens 1Fuel‚Äôs standing as the most secure cryptocurrency wallet . Whales Accumulate 9 Trillion PEPE Tokens: A Bullish Signal Recently, whales have been very active, purchasing 9 trillion PEPE tokens . For instance, one whale took out 337 billion PEPE, worth about $6.92 million, from the Binance exchange. This movement often suggests that these investors plan to hold onto their tokens for a long time. This buying frenzy has encouraged smaller investors to get involved, leading to a significant price jump of 21% in PEPE‚Äôs price over the recent week. PEPE is currently trading around $0.00002552, with its market cap now over $10 billion. Daily trading volume is high at $7 billion, showing strong interest. Overthe past month, PEPE‚Äôs price rose by 130%, and it has gained an impressive 167% over the past year. This recent increase has reportedly turned many investors‚Äô losses into profits. Sui Network‚Äôs Price Surges 25% After Phantom Partnership Phantom cryptocurrency wallet, which has over 7 million active users each month, has recently partnered with Sui Network . This collaboration marks a significant milestone for both Phantom and Sui , as confirmed by the Sui Foundation on December 5. Phantom Wallet previously only supported Solana, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, bit this new integration marks Sui as the fourth blockchain and the first one using the Move programming language. Jameel Khalfan from the Sui Foundation called this partnership a ‚Äúgiant leap‚Äù for Sui, promising users a great wallet experience. Now, Sui users can securely access their wallets on various platforms, including iOS, Android, and popular web browsers. Since teaming up with Phantom Wallet, Sui Network has seen impressive growth. Its price has jumped over 20% in a week and 25% in a month, reaching an all-time high of $4.47. Conclusion The emergence of 1Fuel as a promising altcoin highlights a pivotal moment for investors looking to diversify their portfolios away from established coins like Sui and Pepe. With a presale touted to be the best crypto presale of 2024, a token price of $0.01, and a potential ROI of 500%, investing in 1Fuel today might just be one of the most profitable investment decisions one could ever make.

CleanSpark is diversifying regionally to mitigate risks, investing in mining infrastructure with the potential to reach 63 EH/S with $200mm capital investments. CleanSpark's BTC holdings grew 260% in FY24, nearing 10,000 BTC, with plans to leverage these holdings for additional revenue through asset management and trading. CleanSpark ( CLSK ) remains one of the most resilient BTC miners on the market, growing its hash rate to 33.5EH/S with the trajectory to increase it to 50EH/S in 2025. CleanSpark has also benefited from the price growth for BTC, which now sits just shy of $100,000/BTC. Given the firm‚Äôs growth trajectory and the strong support from the incoming US President-elect Donald Trump, I have reason to believe that BTC may find stability at these higher levels. I recommend CLSK with a BUY rating with a price target of $18.75/share at 5x price/BTC holdings. CleanSpark Operations CleanSpark realized a major turning point for growth, generating $379mm in revenue for FY24, growing by 125% on a year-over-year basis. In addition to this, CleanSpark significantly improved its adjusted EBITDA margin to 65%, up from 15% in FY23, to generate $246mm in FY24. The profitability improvement was primarily driven by fleet efficiency and improved operations. Despite the halving event that took place in early 2024, CleanSpark generated 7,100 BTC in FY24, up from 6,900 in FY23. This was driven by the firm‚Äôs exceptional growth in mining machines, growing its hash rate from 9.6 EH/second in FY23 to 33.5EH/second at the end of FY24. Despite the increased hash rate, the mining operations have certainly experienced its headwinds as a result of the BTC halving event. In November 2024, CleanSpark mined 622 BTC with an ending hash rate of 33.7EH/S. This compares to 666 BTC mined in November 2023 at a rate of 10.08EH/S. Despite the higher hash rate per BTC mined, the BTC market has significantly improved when compared to the previous year, with BTC topping $100,000/BTC at the beginning of December. This compares last year‚Äôs price of ~$43,000/BTC. TradingView In addition to the strong growth, CleanSpark realized improved power costs in FY24. The average cost for power for FY24 was $0.046/kWh, down from $0.048/kWh in FY23. The firm‚Äôs wholesale electricity cost was $0.031/kWh in FY24. All in, CleanSpark‚Äôs cost to mine was $21,400/BTC for FY24. One factor to consider is that the cost has increased going into 2h24, going from $26,950/BTC in q3‚Äô24 to $36,250/BTC in q4‚Äô24. The firm did face some headwinds in q4‚Äô24 as a result of Hurricane Helene which disrupted operations at its Georgia facilities, leading to partial outage that led to a loss in revenue in the range of $2-3mm. Management‚Äôs overall model is to diversify regionally, with mining assets in Georgia, Wyoming, Tennessee, Mississippi, and New York. The basis behind this is to shield the broader operation from any downtime risk as a result of harsh weather, volatility in the power market, and grid instability. This growth was driven by CleanSpark‚Äôs investment in mining infrastructure, ordering 60,000 units in January 2024 with the option to purchase an additional 100,000 units for the same fixed rate. This investment paid off, growing CleanSpark‚Äôs hash rate to 33.5 exahash/second. Management is targeting adding an additional 3.5 exahash/second by the end of December 2024. CleanSpark added 425MW in operational power capacity in FY24, bringing the total capacity to 726MW. From a growth perspective, CleanSpark has 75MW of power contracted in 2025 with the option to increase capacity by hundreds of megawatts for its Wyoming locations as part of its mining site acquisition in May 2024 . In addition to this, CleanSpark has been opportunistic in acquiring assets. Accordingly, management noted in their q4‚Äô24 earnings call that the firm consolidated over 178MW in private asset acquisitions, adding 9 sites in September 2024. In October 2024, CleanSpark acquired GRIID Infrastructure, adding 68MW of developed infrastructure and paving the way for CleanSpark to grow its mining capacity in Tennessee to over 400MW in the coming years. As of q4‚Äô24, CleanSpark is developing 80MW of additional capacity through a greenfield project at its Eastern Tennessee location. With the expansion, CleanSpark has developed a more efficient operating environment, improving its fleet efficiency to 19 joules per terahash in q4‚Äô24, down from 28.4 joules per terahash in q4‚Äô23. Management‚Äôs broader target is to expand its mining operations to 50 EH/second in 2025. Accordingly, CleanSpark has a fixed rate for purchasing ASICs to get the firm to 63EH/second, protecting the firm from potential inflationary costs. Given the current market dynamics, primarily driven by the price of BTC increasing to over $100,000/BTC, management is pivoting its strategy from growth by acquisition to more heavily focus on organic growth. As part of their growth strategy, management made it clear that their focus will remain in BTC mining. This compares to MARA ( MARA ), a competing BTC mining company that is expanding operations to cohosting AI training and cooling technology development. CleanSpark Financial Position Corporate Reports As for CleanSpark‚Äôs growth trajectory to reaching 63EH/second, management noted that the investment in infrastructure will sum to $200mm in capital investments, not including the miners. Accordingly, CleanSpark has a fixed rate to purchase the miners to reach its 63EH/second goal. Given the growth path for CleanSpark, I‚Äôm forecasting the firm to generate $554mm in net revenue in eFY25, with an aEBITDA margin of $325mm. This growth will be driven by CleanSpark increasing its hash rate through both organic growth and private acquisitions. Given the change in administration, I have reason to believe there will be more support for the price of BTC as President-elect Donald Trump has plans to establish a national BTC reserve. This can both improve CleanSpark‚Äôs revenue generation and its book value as part of its BTC HODL strategy. CleanSpark is actively increasing its BTC holdings, growing nearly 260% in FY24 on a year-over-year basis and is nearing 10,000 BTC. Management is planning to further leverage its BTC holdings on the balance sheet, as it did in q4‚Äô24 by securing a $50mm line of credit with Coinbase. In addition to this, the firm is considering other methods of monetizing its BTC holdings, including establishing a digital asset management group within the company. Speculating on the matter, this may mean that the firm will be more active in trading BTC through the volatility, taking advantage of price premiums and discounts. The asset management arm may also be utilized to provide liquidity to the BTC ETFs in the marketplace. Risks Related To CleanSpark Bull Case CleanSpark is well-positioned to grow its operations through capital investments to add additional hash rates to BTC production in a strong BTC price environment. In addition to this, management is exploring additional value-add avenues, including a BTC asset management operation that may add an additional revenue stream through BTC lending and active BTC trading. In addition to this, the new administration is very pro-BTC, with talks of adding a BTC strategic reserve. This may potentially create a price floor for BTC and improve price stability. Bear Case BTC remains highly volatile and may not sustain these recent highs. One factor that I believe may be impactful to the price of BTC is the popularity of BTC ETFs. In the instance of a broader market correction, retail investors may use BTC for liquidity, as the market for BTC is highly liquid with many buyers and sellers. This could potentially drive down the price per BTC if a correction were to occur. Valuation & Shareholder Value Corporate Reports As of q4‚Äô24, CleanSpark has $432mm in BTC on its balance sheet. Accordingly, CleanSpark holds 8,049 BTC on the balance sheet. At the current price of $99,455/BTC, this is valued at $800mm, leading to the CLSK being valued at 4x price/BTC. CleanSpark has significantly underperformed BTC by 72% on a total return basis. TradingView Looking at CleanSpark‚Äôs growth trajectory, I believe shares have room for growth. Using an internal valuation model based on my adjusted EBITDA forecast for eFY25 and the shares‚Äô historical trading premium, I believe shares should be priced at $18.75/share at 11x eFY25 EV/aEBITDA. Corporate Reports Translating this to the firm‚Äôs current BTC holdings and the current market value of BTC, this would price shares at 5x price/BV of BTC. I recommend CLSK with a BUY rating.

Developed by the Movement Network Foundation, the Movement (MOVE) project is reportedly the first Move-EVM Layer 2 solution on the Ethereum network. Binance, one of the world‚Äôs largest crypto exchanges, officially announced the listing of MOVE on December 9, 2024. The listing follows an airdrop campaign on the Binance Airdrops Portal, where users were encouraged to participate by staking BNB in the exchange‚Äôs Simple Earn Flexible or Locked products between December 2 and December 5, 2024. As part of the campaign, Binance distributed a total of 200 million MOVE tokens, which represents 2% of the project‚Äôs maximum token supply.

37424362,https://crypto.news/?p=14317599,1733752692,3 reasons why the IDEX price and volume soared,"IDEX, a prominent player in the decentralized exchange sector, surged to its highest level since March this year. The IDEX (IDEX) token climbed to $0.1150, marking a gain of over 335% from its lowest level this year and pushing its market cap to more than $70 million. This rally occurred in a high-volume environment, with 24-hour trading volume increasing by over 4,420% to reach $318 million. The surge coincided with the total value locked tin IDEX‚Äôs network hitting a record high of $70 million. Most of this volume is on its Ethereum ( ETH ) version, with the rest being on the IDEX Chain and Polygon. Additionally, data by DeFi Llama shows that the weekly trading volume on IDEX V4, its platform for perpetual futures, jumped to $84.2 million‚Äîthe highest on record. The platform‚Äôs all-time volume has now surpassed $388 million. IDEX V4 volume soars | Source: DeFi Llama The coin also rallied ahead of the upcoming launch of Buy & Lock, which is expected to happen later this week. Buy & Lock will be a liquidity initiative to strengthen its on-chain presence. As part of this service, 100% of all fees generated in the network will be reinvested and locked. 50% of these fees will be used to buy the IDEX token, reducing the number of circulating supplies. You might also like: Solana hits new highs as Lightchain AI aims to be the next big contender The remaining 50% of the tokens will be paired with the purchased IDEX and added into a Uniswap ( UNI ) liquidity pool. The developers hope that Buy & Lock will create more value and liquidity for the network. https://twitter.com/idexio/status/1864776646898913334 The new initiative came after the developers launched its points program that lets users trade, stack points, and then claim rewards every Friday. Users can then reinvest these coins and earn as the IDEX price rises. IDEX price faces resistance IDEX chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that the IDEX crypto price surged to a high of $0.1148 on Dec. 9 and then retreated to $0.086. This retreat happened as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and most altcoins declined. The coin remains above the key resistance level at $0.060, its highest level on August 28. It has moved above all moving averages, meaning that bulls are in control. IDEX has moved slightly below the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level. Therefore, the coin will likely bounce back and possibly retest its highest level this week at $0.1148. A break above that level will point to more gains, possibly to the March high of $0.1253.

Here Are the Details,"The Czech Republic has enacted a series of sweeping financial market reforms aimed at positioning itself as a leading destination for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation. Czech Republic Implementing Financial Reforms to Become a Leading Crypto Hub This legislative move will remove key barriers for crypto firms and investors, boosting their appeal in the country‚Äôs fast-growing digital finance sector. Main Features of the Reformation The new legislation enables cryptocurrency businesses and investors to open bank accounts without unnecessary restrictions, removing a long-standing operational hurdle for the industry. This change is expected to facilitate financial transactions, provide stability, and stimulate growth for crypto businesses in the Czech Republic. Another important aspect is the three-year tax exemption period for crypto investments. This measure aligns crypto taxation with traditional assets like stocks, providing a more predictable and favorable tax environment for investors. Deputy Speaker of Parliament Jan Skopeƒçek, one of the leading advocates of the reforms, emphasised the role of the reforms in retaining high-value businesses in the Czech Republic. Skopeƒçek noted the importance of leveraging the country‚Äôs strong talent pool and innovative blockchain companies to remain competitive in the evolving global digital economy. ‚ÄúThese reforms remove unnecessary barriers and provide clarity for businesses and investors, ensuring the Czech Republic remains a top choice for crypto innovation,‚Äù Skopeƒçek said. The reforms come as the European Union prepares for the next phase of its Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, which comes into force on December 30. MiCA aims to harmonize crypto regulations across EU member states, but uneven grace periods and bureaucratic hurdles have created challenges for companies operating within the bloc. By implementing these proactive measures, the Czech Republic has the opportunity to attract both domestic and international investors, potentially outpacing neighboring countries in crypto adoption and innovation. *This is not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Bitcoin hits $100k, sparking rallies for Dogecoin, Cardano, and newcomer Yeti Ouro, which eyes a potential $1 milestone in 2025. Table of Contents Cardano forecast Dogecoin: DOGE prepares to rally Yeti Ouro eyes $1 A midweek rally sparked by Bitcoin‚Äôs rise to $100,000 has boosted several cryptocurrencies, with Dogecoin and Cardano among the big gainers. New DeFI token Yeti Ouro (YETIO) also continues to attract investor interest as it eyes $1 in 2025 amid a great debut in its ongoing presale. Cardano forecast Cardano has been one of this year‚Äôs best crypto tokens for investors after years of lackluster price movements. It has gained over 230% in the past 30 days, hitting a high of $1.3 in early December, its highest price since 2021. The end-year bull rally came at the perfect time for Cardano. Over the past two years, the network has been on a journey to reinvent itself, with Charles Hoskinson and his team at Input Output progressively handing over control of the network to its community via a number of upgrades. Cardano‚Äôs biggest decentralization upgrade has been Voltaire, whose biggest hard fork, Chang, was in early September this year. Chang ushered in a new era of on-chain governance for Cardano, where ADA holders could vote on proposals and elect governance representatives. Giorgio Zinetti, the CTO of the Cardano Foundation, described Chang as ‚Äúthe biggest event in Cardano history,‚Äù and claimed that it made Cardano ‚Äúthe largest layer 1 with on-chain governance.‚Äù When the bull market commenced, Cardano‚Äôs ADA was in a great position to leverage this change in investor sentiment, and it has been reflected in its performance, which is the third-best among the top 20 cryptos after Stellar Lumens and XRP, respectively. You might also like: Bitcoin ETFs surge, XRP shows strength as Yeti Ouro emerges as the next viral altcoin Dogecoin: DOGE prepares to rally Dogecoin has also retained its appeal to investors despite a slowdown in its momentum over the past two weeks. DOGE is still the biggest meme coin, with a $62 billion market cap, which is higher than Cardano and USDC. One of Dogecoin‚Äôs main appeals this year is expected adoption by major companies in the US following the ascension of its biggest cheerleader, Elon Musk, to an influential government position as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency. Many expect that Musk will spark a new wave of major companies accepting DOGE payments, starting with Tesla and X, which he runs. Yeti Ouro eyes $1 Meanwhile, the new Ethereum utility meme coin project Yeti Ouro is eyeing $1 next year as investors tout it to be the next Dogecoin rival. The project has been selling its YETIO tokens for $0.012 in its ongoing presale, a discounted price that has attracted thousands of investors and raised nearly $1 million for the project. With analysts expecting it to hit $1 next year, the presale price is an ideal opportunity to make massive gains for those who invest early. Yeti Ouro is built around Yeti Go, a play-to-earn racing game that rewards winners with YETIO tokens. Built using the Unreal Engine, Yeti Go tests the players‚Äô skills, quick reflexes and gaming acumen as they dodge hazards and attacks from fellow players to emerge victorious. The YETIO token also powers other payments, such as the purchase of weapons and customizations and race entry fees, giving it utility and supporting its bullish thesis. Yeti Ouro has capped the supply of YETIO at one billion tokens and earmarked 5% for the token-burning mechanism.

This fusion of digital currency and traditional card games has not only revolutionized how players engage with poker but has also introduced a new level of excitement and innovation to the gaming industry. As cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to gain traction, their influence on poker platforms is becoming increasingly significant. This article researches into the dynamic intersection of cryptocurrency and poker, exploring how this new era is reshaping the gaming landscape. The Rise of Crypto Poker Platforms: Revolutionizing Online Gaming The advent of crypto poker platforms has marked a significant turning point in the online gaming industry. These platforms have emerged as a popular choice for poker enthusiasts, offering a unique blend of traditional poker gameplay with the modern advantages of cryptocurrency. By leveraging digital currencies, these platforms provide players with a seamless and secure gaming experience, free from the constraints of traditional banking systems. This has opened up new opportunities for players worldwide, allowing them to participate in poker games without the usual geographical and financial barriers. One of the key factors driving the popularity of crypto poker platforms is the enhanced level of privacy and security they offer. Unlike conventional online poker sites, which require players to disclose personal and financial information, crypto platforms allow users to maintain anonymity. This is particularly appealing to players who value their privacy and wish to keep their gaming activities discreet. Additionally, the use of blockchain technology ensures that all transactions are transparent and immutable, further enhancing the security of these platforms. Moreover, the integration of cryptocurrency into poker platforms has introduced a new level of innovation and excitement to the game. Players can now enjoy faster transactions, lower fees, and access to a global pool of opponents. This has not only increased the competitiveness of online poker but has also attracted a new generation of players who are eager to probe the possibilities offered by digital currencies. As a result, crypto poker platforms are rapidly gaining traction, reshaping the landscape of online gaming and setting the stage for a new era of poker. Bitcoin and Ethereum: The Preferred Currencies for Poker Enthusiasts Among the myriad of cryptocurrencies available today, Bitcoin and Ethereum have emerged as the preferred choices for poker enthusiasts. Their widespread acceptance and robust infrastructure make them ideal for use in online poker platforms. Bitcoin, being the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, offers players a reliable and secure means of conducting transactions. Its decentralized nature ensures that players can enjoy a level of financial freedom and autonomy that is unmatched by traditional currencies. Ethereum, on the other hand, brings a unique set of advantages to the table. Known for its smart contract capabilities, Ethereum allows for the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) that can automate various aspects of the poker gaming experience. This includes everything from managing player funds to ensuring fair play through automated processes. The flexibility and versatility of Ethereum make it a popular choice among poker platforms looking to innovate and enhance their offerings. Platforms like GGPoker have embraced these cryptocurrencies, recognizing their potential to revolutionize the online poker experience. By integrating Bitcoin and Ethereum into their systems, these platforms offer players a seamless and efficient way to engage with the game. The use of these digital currencies not only streamlines the transaction process but also provides players with a level of security and transparency that is crucial in the world of online gaming. As more poker enthusiasts turn to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the influence of these cryptocurrencies on the gaming industry is set to grow even further. Blockchain Technology: Ensuring Fair Play and Transparency in Poker The integration of blockchain technology into poker platforms has been a game-changer, ensuring a level of fairness and transparency that was previously unattainable. By utilizing blockchain, poker platforms can create a decentralized and tamper-proof environment where all transactions and game outcomes are recorded on a public ledger. This not only prevents any form of cheating or manipulation but also provides players with the assurance that the games they are participating in are fair and transparent. Card games, particularly poker, have always been susceptible to issues of trust and fairness. However, with blockchain technology, these concerns are effectively addressed. The immutable nature of blockchain ensures that all game data is securely stored and cannot be altered, providing players with a level of confidence that is essential in the world of online gaming. As a result, blockchain technology is playing a key role in transforming the poker industry, paving the way for a more secure and trustworthy gaming experience. The intersection of cryptocurrency and poker represents a new era in the gaming industry, characterized by innovation, security, and global accessibility. Crypto poker platforms have revolutionized the way players engage with the game, offering a level of privacy and efficiency that is unmatched by traditional platforms. The use of Bitcoin and Ethereum as preferred currencies has further enhanced the online poker experience, providing players with a reliable and secure means of conducting transactions. Blockchain technology has been instrumental in ensuring fair play and transparency in poker, addressing long-standing concerns about trust and security. By leveraging the power of blockchain, poker platforms can offer players a level of assurance that is crucial in the world of online gaming. As the popularity of cryptocurrency continues to grow, its influence on the poker industry is set to expand, ushering in a new era of gaming that is both exciting and transformative. In conclusion, the fusion of cryptocurrency and poker is reshaping the gaming landscape, offering players a unique and innovative experience. As more platforms embrace digital currencies and blockchain technology, the future of poker looks promising, with endless possibilities for growth and development. This new era of gaming is not only revolutionizing how players engage with poker but is also setting the stage for a more secure, transparent, and exciting gaming experience.

37424116,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624879,1733751493,China plans to restructure its monetary policies to encourage domestic consumption,"According to a report from the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee meeting held on December 9, China plans to change its monetary policies to improve economic growth and boost domestic consumption. The meeting was held after the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics released the inflation report, which indicated a slowdown in economic growth in the country. In the meeting, the Beijing administration promised to loosen monetary policies while being more proactive in its fiscal stimulus measures. The Politburo, a body led by Chinese President Xi Jinping, also revealed other top priorities for the government in the coming year to improve the economy. The meeting, presided by Xi Jinping, first aimed to analyze the current economic performance. The report added that the performance review would pave the way for policy implementation for 2025. The Beijing administration also discussed the economic growth target for 2025 during the meeting while also planning the country‚Äôs budget. The body‚Äôs policy changes will further aid its advisory decisions with other sectors, including the parliament, of their future decisions. The Politburo decision to initiate fiscal policy changes is the first since 2010, marking over 14 years since the last policy changes in the country. In late 2010, the body initiated policy changes after another change after the 2008 global financial crisis. Despite the Beijing administration not initiating changes frequently, China remains the second-largest economy globally. China deals with growing economic risks The Politburo confirmed that decreasing inflation has negatively affected the economy‚Äôs growth. The rates in November showed that the country‚Äôs inflation hit a 5-month low, with China‚Äôs consumer price index rising by only 0.2% year-on-year. The consumer price index also dropped by 0.6% month-on-month, compared to October‚Äôs 0.3% drop. Many analysts outlined the possibility of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump triggering trade wars. Trump has vocalized his tariff plans, which would hit China, Mexico, and Canada the most. The risk of economic instability caused by Trump‚Äôs tariffs has been one of the greatest contributors to the country‚Äôs slow economic growth. The risks have further created instability in some of the country‚Äôs sectors, especially the housing sector, which faces high housing taxes and mortgages. According to Stansberry analyst Brian Tycangco, China expects the current policy shifts to create more stability in stocks and housing. The analyst also outlined the possibility of an increase in RRR cuts, a reduction in personal tax cuts, and a better focus on direct fiscal stimulus. Tycangco added that the policies would further try to maintain growth in all departments in the country, increasing all-rounded domestic demand. Analysts bank on a 5% economic growth target A Reuters report outlined that Beijing administration advisers are encouraging the government to adopt 5% as the economic growth target for 2025. The report also highlighted that the advisors believe focusing on fiscal stimulus will help the country better manage the effects of Trump‚Äôs tariffs. Goldman Sachs has suggested that implementing a 20% tariff on Chinese imports would weigh the country‚Äôs GDP by 7%. The report also pointed out a Reuters poll, which revealed that many analysts project that the Beijing administration will stick to a 5% economic growth target for 2025. Another poll suggested that China would get about 4.5% in economic growth in the coming year. The report insisted that the projected range by most analysts was between 4% and 5%.

The acquisition, conducted between December 2 and December 8, was executed at an average price of $98,783 per Bitcoin. With this latest purchase, the business intelligence giant now holds a total of 423,650 BTC, valued at around $42 billion. MicroStrategy‚Äôs Fifth Consecutive Week of Bitcoin Purchase The latest acquisition marks the firm‚Äôs fifth consecutive week of Bitcoin investments. Just last week, MicroStrategy acquired 15,400 BTC for $1.5 billion at an average price of $95,976 per coin. The company financed the recent transaction through the sale of approximately 5.4 million shares of its common stock, part of a broader $21 billion equity offering authorized in October 2024. MicroStrategy plans to raise $42 billion over the next three years, with the funding split evenly between equity and fixed-income securities. Of this, $9.19 billion worth of shares remains available for future sales. Co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor revealed that the firm‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings were acquired at an average cost of $60,324 per BTC, totaling $25.6 billion, including fees.

In its submission to Amazon, the think tank raised concerns over inflation‚Äôs impact on corporate reserves. It criticized the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which currently estimates inflation at 4.95%, as a ‚Äúremarkably poor measure‚Äù of actual currency debasement. The organization suggested that the real inflation rate could be significantly higher, potentially double the official CPI figure. The proposal is set to be discussed at the company‚Äôs April 2025 shareholder meeting. The NCPPR‚Äôs proposal aligns with a broader push for institutional Bitcoin adoption. In October, it urged Microsoft to invest in Bitcoin through a similar letter. However, Microsoft advised shareholders to reject it , stating management already evaluates such matters. The proposal will be discussed this week at Microsoft‚Äôs annual meeting on December 10. Last week, Bitcoin‚Äôs price dip to $92,957 spurred major acquisitions by BlackRock and MARA Holdings, who collectively purchased 9,173 Bitcoin. BlackRock made the most significant move, purchasing 7,750 Bitcoin. This acquisition pushed the asset management giant‚Äôs total Bitcoin holdings to $48.9 billion. Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings added 1,423 Bitcoin in four transactions between December 5 and 6, valued at $139.5 million. The acquisitions came after the firm closed its second $850 million convertible note offering, earmarked for boosting Bitcoin reserves.

37423709,https://coinpedia.org/?p=391083,1733751047,Why XRP Is Going Down: 8% Drop Explained!,"The post Why XRP Is Going Down: 8% Drop Explained! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP, the cryptocurrency closely associated with Ripple, experienced a sharp 8% drop today, bringing its price down to $2.36 . This unexpected dip, the steepest in over two months, has left investors puzzled, especially as the token remains near its all-time highs. So, what triggered this bearish momentum? Ripple CEO‚Äôs Missed Opportunity? A major factor behind XRP‚Äôs decline seems to be Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse‚Äôs recent appearance on CBS‚Äôs 60 Minutes . While the interview tackled some of Ripple‚Äôs challenges, it conspicuously omitted a critical point: a Federal Judge‚Äôs ruling that XRP is not a security. This omission did not sit well with the crypto community. Garlinghouse himself expressed frustration, calling it a missed opportunity to shed light on Ripple‚Äôs ongoing legal battles. Following the broadcast, XRP‚Äôs price plummeted by 8%, hitting $2.35 within a single day. Liquidations Add More Pressure XRP‚Äôs drop became even worse due to a surge in liquidations. In the past 24 hours, over $14.5 million worth of long positions on XRP were liquidated . This was part of a broader $358 million sell-off across the crypto market, which triggered a ripple effect, pushing prices down further. Increased market activity was evident as XRP‚Äôs trading volume soared to $12 billion within the last day. However, the selling pressure also dragged XRP‚Äôs market capitalization below $136 billion, pushing it behind Tether (USDT) in the cryptocurrency rankings. Another contributing factor is profit-taking . Many investors appear to be cashing in after XRP‚Äôs strong rally earlier in November. Additionally, market attention is shifting towards Bitcoin and Ethereum, further reducing demand for XRP. Curious about where XRP is headed? Read our long term XRP price prediction to uncover insights on potential breakouts and future trends! Can XRP Recover? Key Levels to Watch From a technical perspective , XRP has fallen below critical support levels, including $2.45. This suggests the potential for further short-term declines. However, there are glimmers of hope for the token. Currently hovering around the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $2.33, XRP could find support at this zone. Analysts believe that breaking above $3 could reignite bullish momentum and set the stage for a rally toward $5. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37423725,https://coinpaper.com/6435/venture-capitalists-question-crypto-s-role-in-ai-disruption,1733751040,Venture Capitalists Question Crypto's Role in AI Disruption,"The intersection of cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence is rapidly emerging as a focal point for technological innovation and investment. However, recent developments highlight the complexities and debates shaping these industries. At a major conference in Prague, venture capitalists expressed skepticism over the ability of crypto projects to disrupt established AI leaders, emphasizing the need for practical use cases. Meanwhile, in the United States, President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs appointment of David Sacks as the presumptive White House AI and Crypto Czar has sparked discussions about the future of AI governance, decentralization, and the role of blockchain in reshaping these sectors. Crypto and AI: Venture Capitalists Express Skepticism on Decentralized Disruption in the AI Space The intersection of cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence (AI) has ignited significant interest and investment, with retail investors and venture capitalists (VCs) alike pouring resources into innovative projects. However, skepticism remains among key figures in the VC world about the potential of crypto projects to meaningfully disrupt dominant AI players in the current cycle. Speaking at the Emergence conference in Prague, two prominent venture capitalists outlined both their doubts and the nuanced opportunities for blockchain and AI integration. Rob Hadick, a general partner at the crypto-focused VC firm Dragonfly, addressed a recurring issue he sees in the crypto industry: the tendency to ‚Äùput things on-chain‚Äù without improving upon their off-chain counterparts. ‚ÄúCrypto has a problem of taking things that exist really, really well off-chain, making them worse, putting them on-chain, and selling them to people who are already on-chain,‚Äù Hadick remarked. This criticism was not limited to AI but spanned various narratives in the blockchain space. According to Hadick, many current AI-crypto crossover projects fail to justify their existence, often lacking the critical product-market fit necessary to compete with centralized AI leaders such as OpenAI, Microsoft, and Anthropic. Despite this skepticism, both Hadick and David Pakman, managing director at CoinFund, acknowledged the transformative potential AI holds for the broader crypto ecosystem. Pakman highlighted that AI could play a pivotal role in enhancing developer productivity‚Äîa key factor in the resource-intensive world of blockchain development. ‚ÄùAI is a massive software, technical revolution,‚Äù Pakman stated. ‚ÄùWe're building a lot of software in Web3, and we should benefit from the use of AI in a bunch of different decentralized applications, both in infrastructure and security and the way user apps behave.‚Äù In this context, AI‚Äôs utility lies in streamlining the development of decentralized applications (dApps), fortifying blockchain infrastructure, and enhancing security protocols. Pakman‚Äôs perspective focuses on the idea that, while crypto may not fundamentally disrupt AI giants, it can still leverage AI to refine its ecosystem. The Challenge of Decentralized AI Models The conversation turned to whether decentralized AI systems could compete with highly centralized entities. Both panelists expressed doubts that this would be feasible in the current cycle, primarily due to the immense compute resources and infrastructure required to train large-scale AI models. ‚ÄùWe‚Äôve been really skeptical of this idea that there's going to be a market around things like decentralized training or doing anything around models on-chain,‚Äù said Hadick. He noted that Dragonfly‚Äôs investments in this space were limited to niche applications, such as edge computing for latency-insensitive workloads. Pakman echoed this sentiment but emphasized the importance of exploring alternatives to the centralized AI landscape. ‚ÄùIf we want a future of highly centralized AI, we should continue on the current path we‚Äôre on,‚Äù Pakman said. ‚ÄùBut if we want an alternate future, where compute resources to train really large AI models are more decentralized and democratically distributed for access, then we should talk about the wonderful ways Web3 decentralizes access to a tech stack or hardware.‚Äù While the panelists were critical of many current AI-crypto projects, they acknowledged the value of ongoing experimentation in the space. They praised builders who are laying the groundwork for decentralized alternatives, particularly those who are leveraging blockchain to democratize access to compute resources and technical infrastructure. Projects focusing on local AI models and decentralized hardware solutions‚Äîsuch as blockchain-based marketplaces for GPU resources‚Äîwere highlighted as promising directions. While these initiatives may not rival the central AI powerhouses in the short term, they represent a step toward a more equitable technological future. Both Hadick and Pakman urged crypto builders to ‚Äùfollow the incentives‚Äù rather than attempting to replicate centralized AI capabilities. According to Hadick, the focus should be on solving tangible problems where blockchain technology offers clear advantages, rather than forcing AI solutions into a decentralized framework without a compelling use case. The AI-crypto crossover remains a dynamic frontier, full of both potential and pitfalls. While the current cycle may not see decentralized AI systems dethrone industry titans, the ongoing integration of AI into the blockchain space is poised to yield meaningful advancements in efficiency, security, and accessibility. As Pakman concluded, the future of AI in Web3 lies not in competing with centralized behemoths, but in complementing the ecosystem with tools and systems that align with blockchain‚Äôs core values of decentralization and accessibility. Whether this vision will materialize in the next cycle remains an open question‚Äîbut the groundwork is being laid today. David Sacks Named Trump‚Äôs AI and Crypto Czar: A Bold Move Amid AI Industry Tensions In other AI news, United States president-elect Donald Trump has named David Sacks, a veteran tech executive and member of the illustrious ‚ÄúPayPal Mafia,‚Äù as the presumptive ‚ÄùWhite House AI and Crypto Czar.‚Äù The announcement, made via Trump‚Äôs Truth Social account on Dec. 5, has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence (AI) sectors, sparking debate over Sacks‚Äô controversial views and deep connections to prominent figures such as Elon Musk. Sacks‚Äô appointment was met with a wave of enthusiasm from the cryptocurrency community, where he is celebrated as a staunch supporter of Solana and a multi-coin investor. Known for his forward-thinking approach to blockchain and decentralized finance, Sacks has long been a proponent of policies that encourage innovation in the crypto space while reducing regulatory bottlenecks. His leadership is expected to bring renewed focus to crypto-friendly legislation and initiatives, a sentiment echoed by several prominent industry voices. One notable supporter, Ryan Selkis, former CEO of the Messari cryptocurrency exchange, chimed in with a sarcastic remark on X, ‚ÄúThis makes me so happy,‚Äù accompanied by a meme. While Selkis‚Äô tone might hint at skepticism, the broader crypto community seems optimistic about Sacks' ability to steer US policy toward crypto innovation. Sacks‚Äô influence on the AI industry is equally notable, albeit more polarizing. He has consistently championed open-source AI solutions and a hands-off regulatory approach, arguing that self-regulation is vital for the sector's growth. While this perspective has garnered support from tech entrepreneurs wary of government overreach, it has also raised concerns among those who advocate for stricter controls to prevent misuse of AI technologies. Sacks‚Äô strong stance on AI regulation aligns closely with that of Elon Musk, with whom he shares both a professional history and a critical view of OpenAI‚Äôs business practices. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI as a nonprofit organization in 2015, has been vocal about his disapproval of the company‚Äôs subsequent pivot to a for-profit model under CEO Sam Altman . At the heart of the tension lies OpenAI‚Äôs controversial restructuring, which has drawn criticism from Musk and other industry figures, including Sacks. Initially established as a nonprofit research organization, OpenAI introduced a ‚Äùfor-profit branch‚Äù to support its monetized operations and scale its efforts in artificial intelligence development. This shift has been met with legal challenges, most notably from Musk‚Äôs AI company, xAI, which filed a lawsuit in California to block the for-profit pivot. The legal battle intensified on Dec. 2, when Musk‚Äôs lawyers filed a motion to halt OpenAI‚Äôs transition while the case proceeds. On an October episode of the All-In Podcast, Sacks and guest Mark Cuban expressed their disapproval of OpenAI‚Äôs actions. Sacks accused the company of betraying its philanthropic roots, stating, ‚ÄúOpenAI tricked Musk into investing in what was thought to be a philanthropic endeavor.‚Äù Cuban echoed this sentiment, adding, ‚ÄúWhen people f--- over investors, it always comes back. Karma is a bitch in business, too.‚Äù Musk, Altman, and a Social Media Drama The drama surrounding Sacks‚Äô appointment took a lighthearted turn on social media, where Musk and Altman exchanged veiled jabs. After Altman publicly congratulated Sacks on X, Musk responded with a laughing-crying emoji, a gesture that many interpreted as a sarcastic critique of Altman‚Äôs leadership. The exchange prompted reactions from industry insiders, including Selkis, whose tongue-in-cheek commentary added another layer of intrigue to the unfolding saga. As Sacks prepares to take on his new role, his appointment signals a potentially transformative era for AI and crypto policy in the United States. His support for open-source AI and blockchain technology suggests a commitment to fostering innovation, albeit with minimal government intervention. However, his criticisms of centralized entities like OpenAI and his ties to Musk could complicate his ability to navigate the broader AI landscape, particularly as tensions between centralized and decentralized models continue to escalate. For the crypto community, Sacks‚Äô leadership may bring a much-needed ally in Washington, one who understands the unique challenges and opportunities facing the industry. Yet, his views on AI regulation could put him at odds with policymakers advocating for greater oversight, setting the stage for a contentious tenure.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6435/venture-capitalists-question-crypto-s-role-in-ai-disruption,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

37423619,https://crypto.news/?p=14317584,1733750859,This DOGE alternative is set to turn $800 into $80000,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogecoin soars 175% in November, but Rexas Finance emerges as the next big opportunity with a potential 10,000% return by 2025. Table of Contents Rexas Finance: Examining real-world asset tokenization‚Äôs prospect How might one purchase Rexas Finance? Conclusion Closing with an amazing 175% gain, Dogecoin emerged as one of the best-performing mega-cap cryptocurrencies as November came to an end. On November 22, its price peaked at $0.45 as DOGE battled to acquire more momentum following this climb. Traders started locking in gains, and by the end of the month, Dogecoin had dropped 16% to $0.40. Crypto markets surged with major market catalysts, including WisdomTree‚Äôs XRP ETF filings and MicroStrategy‚Äôs $1.4 billion Bitcoin buy. But Dogecoin fell short of surpassing its $0.50 benchmark, which resulted in a lack of immediate momentum. For those who buy now and hold, another token quickly attracts interest and is expected to offer significantly more profits. At just $0.125, this coin has already shown an amazing 316% return since its September introduction. Should it continue its increasing path experts estimate it may reach $12 by the end of 2025. That‚Äôs a possible 10,000% gain from a $800 investment to $80,000. The token in question is none other than Rexas Finance. Rexas Finance: Examining real-world asset tokenization‚Äôs prospect Leading in the real-world asset tokenizing scene is Rexas Finance. Unlike Dogecoin, which has mostly been a meme coin, Rexas Finance is driven by developing concrete blockchain use cases. Its main objective is to use blockchain for flawless tokenization, democratizing access to real-world assets. On the Rexas platform, assets, including real estate, art, goods, and intellectual property, may now be tokenized, bought, and traded worldwide, providing users with unheard-of liquidity and transparency. Whether users wish to tokenize a piece of real estate or a company trying to simplify asset management, the platform‚Äôs user-friendly design makes asset tokenizing accessible to everybody. Rexas Finance is a strong candidate for the next big crypto rise since it is leveraging a huge market potential that many others have yet to explore by streamlining difficult procedures. Rexas Finance has grown remarkably since its September 8 launch. The platform started its presale at $0.03 for its Stage 1 offering; three months later, at Stage 9, the price jumped to $0.125. Investor interest is rising given the money raised of $22,333,050 of its $26,375,000 target and more than 302,662,122 tokens sold out of a total of 335 million. Rexas Finance will be listed on three main exchanges in early 2025 for $0.20, matching the expected bull run in the crypto industry. Now would be the ideal moment to invest since the token‚Äôs value is anticipated to soar to $12 by the end of 2025. For individuals wishing to convert $800,000 into $80,000, Rexas Finance‚Äôs expected 10,000% rise presents a unique chance not seen in the crypto industry.

37423885,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51720,1733750776,How Do Traditional Payment Methods Compare to Crypto in Casinos?,"Money might not grow on trees, but in the online casino world, it sure flows through all kinds of pipes. Whether you‚Äôre spinning the slots or doubling down on blackjack, how you move your cash matters. In Zambia, the payment options for online casinos are growing faster than a 90s dial-up modem. Traditional methods are still leading the pack but crypto emerges as the new kid on the block. But how do these options stack up? Let‚Äôs break it down The Tried-and-True: Traditional Payment Methods For years, Zambian players have relied on mobile money and bank cards. Airtel Money, MTN Mobile Money, and Kazang are household names, offering quick, reliable ways to deposit and withdraw. They‚Äôre user-friendly, widely accepted, and perfect for players who value simplicity. And let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äì most online casinos, including the ever-popular Betway Casino , practically roll out the red carpet for these options. But let‚Äôs not ignore the quirks. While deposits are usually a breeze, withdrawals can sometimes take longer than you‚Äôd like. Nothing kills a Friday night vibe faster than waiting on your jackpot to process. Plus, some methods sneak in transaction fees, making those winnings feel a little lighter. Still, for most players, the familiarity and ease of use make these methods the go-to choice. Crypto: The Flashy New Contender Enter cryptocurrencies ‚Äì the cool new kid in town, rocking Bitcoin wallets and Ethereum chains. These digital currencies are bringing lightning-fast transactions and lower fees to the table. Imagine cashing out your winnings in minutes instead of hours. That‚Äôs the kind of speed we‚Äôre talking about here. On top of that, crypto comes with the added bonus of privacy. Thanks to blockchain technology, your financial details are locked down tighter than your grandma‚Äôs cookie jar. But, as with any shiny new tech, there are trade-offs. First, not every casino is ready to embrace crypto just yet. Many platforms catering to Zambian players haven‚Äôt fully integrated digital currencies. This will limit your options. And then there‚Äôs the volatility. Crypto values can swing wildly ‚Äì your winnings might be worth a fortune today and lunch money tomorrow. Add to that the regulatory uncertainty in Zambia, and it‚Äôs clear that while crypto is exciting, it‚Äôs not for the faint of heart. Head-to-Head: Traditional vs. Crypto So, how do these two payment giants measure up? When it comes to speed, crypto takes the crown. Transactions take minutes, while traditional methods ‚Äì especially withdrawals ‚Äì can take days. Fees also lean in crypto‚Äôs favour, with most transactions costing far less than bank or mobile money transfers. However, traditional methods win in terms of accessibility and acceptance. They‚Äôre everywhere, familiar, and backed by solid regulations ‚Äì something crypto can‚Äôt yet claim. For Zambian players, Betway Casino is a household name. It‚Äôs the kind of platform that makes gambling easy, with support for popular local payment options like Airtel Money and MTN Mobile Money. Whether you‚Äôre depositing a quick 10 ZMW for some weekend fun or cashing out your big win, the process is smooth and straightforward. While crypto isn‚Äôt on their roster yet, Betway has a reputation for staying ahead of trends, so who knows what the future holds? Which Option is Right for You? Here‚Äôs the deal: if you value speed and lower fees, crypto is worth exploring. It‚Äôs a bold choice, great for tech-savvy players ready to embrace the future. If you prefer the comfort of tried-and-true methods, traditional payment systems are still your best bet. As the gambling world continues to evolve, keeping up with payment innovations is part of the fun. Whether you‚Äôre sticking with the classics or dipping your toes into crypto, choose what works best for you.

37424725,https://invezz.com/?p=2379612,1733750773,Five fast-rising coins to buy before you‚Äôre left behind during the bull run,"Amid ongoing crypto activity, whether by veteran or novice investors, interest is directed toward potentially lucrative projects. Those focused on advanced technologies, unique business models, and first-mover advantage will probably be the next batch of winners. Some of the most solid candidates seem to be Injective (INJ), Cosmos (ATOM), Celestia (TIA), Toncoin (TON), and Rexas Finance (RXS). While all these tokens contribute to the project somehow, the industry change is led by Rexas Finance (RXS). Rexas Finance (RXS): the pinnacle in the tokenization era progression It is pertinent to note that Rexas Finance is not simply another altcoin; it is a revolutionary platform that seeks to marry the traditional financial world with the blockchain. The Rexas platform emphasizes Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, allowing ordinary people to own shares of fixed assets that include property, fine art, and intellectual property. With a current presale of $0.125 in the 9th stage, RXS has garnered over $23 million and sold 308.5 million tokens as of this writing. This is quite impressive and speaks volumes about its profitability. The ecosystem also has the Rexas Launchpad and Token Builder, which give businesses the power to tokenize their assets and build solutions on the blockchain seamlessly. This combination of utility and innovation makes Rexas more competitive than Injective and Cosmos, which concentrate on niche applications. Rexas has made some considerable achievements, including a CertiK audit and features on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. As such, the soon-to-be-launched million-dollar giveaway, where each participant has an opportunity to win $50,000 worth of the RXS token, also emphasizes that the team aims to enhance community loyalty. According to the analysts‚Äô initial estimates, Rexas Finance may deliver 100x and more returns in the upcoming bull market, which will encourage many token investors. Its benefit, the ability to access high-value assets, is quite revolutionary in the crypto community. Injective (INJ): pioneering decentralized finance Injective Protocol seems to have secured a place among the top leading decentralized exchange protocols built for derivatives trading. With a priority on interoperability, Injective links different blockchain systems for quicker, lower-cost, and simpler trading. Naturally, in the last twelve months, INJ has displayed remarkable price trends, soaring over 109%. Its tokenomics and governance model are extremely appealing to investors seeking long-term value chains during the bull run. Since the adoption of DeFi continues to increase, INJ is set to surf the wave. However, even if its development is well established, it has rivals like Cosmos and is saddled by the immense potential of disrupters like Rexas Finance. Cosmos (ATOM): the internet of blockchains The Cosmos network seeks to develop an ecosystem in which different blockchains are compatible while ensuring that both value and data are prioritized. Given that it is a very dynamic project in the blockchain space, the project has a distinct proof of stake (PoS) consensus, which, when combined with the IBC protocol, makes the project one of the cornerstones of the Web3 architecture. ATOM has shown some solidity and steady growth, making it worth about $3.9 Billion as of this writing. Its ecosystem is growing as it is home to new projects in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized governance. Despite Cosmos being a quality project with great fundamentals, it operates in a highly saturated market where it is vital to be set apart. This is where Rexas Finance‚Äôs strategy of tokenizing real-world assets (RWA) applies very well. Celestia (TIA): modular blockchain revolution game Celestia is establishing itself as a modular blockchain network, which enables developers to create blockchains optimized for particular use cases. This modularity design lowers the barrier to excess and makes it easier to scale up, thus becoming popular with developers who seek to simplify the building of dApps. TIA, with the launch of the native token for the Celestia ecosystem, the project has been steadily growing ever since. Analysts note its potential as they think it would be able to market itself as soon as the strain for a more scalable blockchain solution emerges. Nonetheless, while Celestia‚Äôs tech developments are impressive, they are rather niche projects compared to Rexas Finance, which has broader applications for both retail and institutional investors. Toncoin(TON): expanding voice of this ecosystem Toncoin is built on The Open Network (TON), one of the most impressive projects within the crypto world. TON, which is the creation of Telegram, was intended to be seamlessly incorporated into its platform, thereby making cryptocurrency easier for the masses as it gets to the hands of millions of users. Migrating towards energy efficiency, TON‚Äôs proof of stake consensus will also be able to ensure that energy is used efficiently and that its ecosystem is complimentary to DeFi, NFTs, and micropayments. With a market cap above 17.7 billion dollars as of this writing, Toncoin sports a high rank within the space. Its dependency on Telegram for its uptake is a drawback compared to Rexas Finance, which has numerous applications and operates within different industries. Conclusion: Rexas Finance (RXS)- the leader Altcoins such as Injective, Cosmos, Celestia, and Toncoin all present interesting prospects, but it‚Äôs fair to say Rexas Finance excels in this context. It stands a chance to be the first mover in RWA tokenization which will definitely increase the wider audience for the blockchain technology in the retail and institutional sectors. With a cryptocurrency bull market on the horizon, it would be prudent to look for projects with good fundamentals and use cases. Rexas Finance satisfies all requirements and is the token to consider and acquire before the bullish market begins. You are early; the time to respond has come.

37423433,https://coinpedia.org/?p=391077,1733750378,These Two Top Tokens are Sliding Into a Bearish Well-How Long Can XRP & SOL Price Bear the Heat?,"The post These Two Top Tokens are Sliding Into a Bearish Well-How Long Can XRP & SOL Price Bear the Heat? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto markets are contracting again as the Bitcoin price is losing grip over the rally as the token is struggling to sustain above $98,500. This has caused the other top altcoins, like Ethereum, to lose support as it drops below $3,900. As a result, the other altcoins within the top 10 like XRP & Solana are facing massive selling pressure. The tokens have printed huge bearish candles and hence are believed to test the pivotal support. Will the XRP $ SOL price retrace this week? If yes, here are the levels it may reach before the weekend. The XRP price has been trying hard to rise above the interim highs at around $2.75 since the start of the month, but the bearish hold seems to be higher than the buying pressure. Therefore, the price is dropping at a faster rate. Besides, the volume also has decreased, suggesting the bulls could be facing some exhaustion and after maintaining a sluggish trend, they are expected to utilise all their accumulated strength and push the price above $3. The STF chart of XRP suggests the price is facing immense upward pressure. The bulls remain passive as they await the token to reach their buying range. After the rejection from the resistance of the expanding channel, the price is on its way to reaching support, which could confirm the end of the correction. Besides, the RSI is forming constant lower highs and lows, validating the bearish claim. Therefore, the price is expected to hit the support close to $2 as the Ichimoku cloud is about to go bearish with the base & conversion line heading towards a bearish crossover. Regardless of the growing bearish case, the XRP price is still primed to rise and reclaim the lost level and eventually revamp a strong ascending trend, marking the highs above $4. What‚Äôs Next for the Solana (SOL) Price Rally? Solana tried to make a move above the bearish formation but eventually failed to clear the pivotal resistance around $245. Due to this, the bulls have lost most of their strength, pushing the price back within the bearish range. With this move, the lower targets for SOL price close to $210 remain active, provided the bulls fail to hold the token above $220. The SOL price trades within a falling wedge in the short term, hence displaying a huge possibility of a rebound. The stochastic RSI enters the oversold range and prepares for a bullish crossover. The MACD indicates the selling pressure continues to grow, which may compel the price to drop below the support at $223 and after reaching the support just below $220, a strong rebound could elevate the levels back to $235. If the bulls display strength, then the price is believed to break the range and enter the resistance zone between $247.78 and $249.59. A rise above the range is expected if the bulls display strength and if the market sentiments turn extremely bullish, then the Solana (SOL) price rally is expected to mark a new ATH close to $275.",NEGATIVE,SOL | XRP,ALTCOIN | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/these-two-top-tokens-are-sliding-into-a-bearish-well-how-long-can-xrp-sol-price-bear-the-heat/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

She drew comparisons to Bitcoin and posed a thought-provoking question: If Bitcoin can reach $1 million per coin, why can‚Äôt Shiba Inu reach $0.01?Notably, prominent industry leaders have argued for a future where Bitcoin could be worth $1 million per coin. They include Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy, financial author Robert Kiyosaki, and former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. These industry experts have forecasted that Bitcoin could reach this lofty price point as early as 2030, just six years away. At $1 million per coin, Bitcoin would have a total market valuation of $21 trillion.¬†While experts are unanimous in their bold forecast for Bitcoin, skepticism remains regarding Shiba Inu‚Äôs potential to reach a lofty target like the one-cent dream.Why Can‚Äôt Shiba Inu Reach $0.01 if Bitcoin is Expected to Reach $1M?As of today, Shiba Inu is trading with four zeros at $0.00003. Attaining $0.01 would require Shiba Inu‚Äôs price to increase by 332-fold or 33,233%.¬†Market analysts have largely dismissed the possibility of Shiba Inu reaching $0.01 , mainly due to its extensive circulating supply. Those who believe in the possibility often set extended timelines like 2040. Shiba Inu $0.01 prediction timeline by Telegaon However, Shiba Inu proponents like Lola remain steadfast in the belief that this dream could become a reality someday.Lola's latest comments on the subject focused on the importance of SHIB's tokenomics and its deflationary mechanism. She emphasized that burn activity plays a crucial role in its future value.According to Lola, when SHIB was priced at $0.000006, it was the perfect time to reduce the supply. However, as SHIB‚Äôs price increases, the need for high-volume revenue-generating activities to support continued burns becomes even more significant.She pointed to developments within the XRP ecosystem, where the incoming Ripple stablecoin will burn XRP with transactions, which enthusiasts see as a bullish factor. Lola cited this as a prime example of how burn mechanisms can enhance the value of a token.Propositions for SHIB $0.01 DreamAccordingly, Lola speculated that platforms like Robinhood could create Layer 2 (L2) solutions to avoid future regulatory issues and use SHIB as their gas token, helping the price soar.In this hypothetical scenario, Robinhood adopting SHIB as the gas for transactions within their L2 could be a step toward mass adoption and usage of SHIB in a more mainstream context.Ultimately, whether SHIB can reach $0.01 remains to be seen. Proponents believe that with the right combination of deflationary mechanics, increased adoption, and institutional integration, the path forward could be more promising than many think.",NEUTRAL,SHIB | XRP,BTC | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/09/pundit-says-why-cant-shiba-inu-reach-0-01-if-bitcoin-can-reach-1m/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pundit-says-why-cant-shiba-inu-reach-0-01-if-bitcoin-can-reach-1m,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

According to Trump‚Äôs campaign manifesto, his government could significantly impact the relationships between the world and the United States. One of his most popular promises was his pledge to establish the United States as the center of crypto, and the industry is eager. Behind the scenes, a team of senior aides and prospective White House officials are formulating their initial policy initiatives to fulfill the president-elect‚Äôs campaign promises.¬†There is a fervent commitment within his camp to speedily and effectively implement the president-elect‚Äôs vision in comparison to his first term. Trump‚Äôs top five priorities About trade, Trump is committed to imposing 25% tariffs on all products imported from Mexico and Canada on his first day in office in January unless those countries satisfactorily stop the flow of illegal drugs such as fentanyl into the United States and illegal immigration. Additionally, he has issued threats to impose supplementary tariffs on China until it implements measures to reduce fentanyl production. However, Trump stated that he is unable to guarantee that the tariffs he has promised to impose on key U.S. foreign trade partners will not increase prices for American consumers. On taxes and budgets, Trump made assurances regarding tax policy to both businesses and individuals. Among other things, tax reductions on tipped income, overtime pay, some Social Security taxes, tax reductions for first responders and the military, and Americans residing abroad, as well as deductions for auto loan interest. In addition, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) provisions that are about to expire will almost probably be extended, though there will likely be a long fight over some important details. Trump will put in place big new taxes, though they might not be as strong at first as he said he would be during the campaign. On border and immigration, the incoming administration is set to implement strict border measures, strike down Biden-era policies, and initiate the detention and deportation of migrants on a large scale. Immigration was a central focus of President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs 2024 presidential campaign. However, unlike his initial campaign, which was primarily focused on the construction of a border wall, Trump has shifted his focus to interior enforcement and the removal of undocumented immigrants who are already in the United States. On retribution and the deep state, Trump issued over 100 threats to investigate, prosecute, and imprison his perceived adversaries, including political opponents and private citizens, during the 2024 presidential campaign. Trump was attacked during his campaign by entities dubbed as the deep state. These are people who perceive themselves to be above the law. Photo of Donald Trump with his right fist in the air after an assassination attempt during a campaign stop in Pennsylvania. Trump‚Äôs opponents anticipate that the president-elect may implement a policy of ‚Äúretribution,‚Äù as he phrased it. On foreign policy , Trump indicated a return to his ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù foreign policy, which was characterized by a decrease in international collaboration and an increase in isolationism. However, this did not prevent Trump from claiming his ability to end Russia‚Äôs war against Ukraine within 24 hours of assuming office, bring peace to the Middle East, and exert dominance over China, one of the United States‚Äô largest geopolitical rivals. Crypto‚Äôs position in the Trump government Crypto is a priority for the incoming government, just not the most urgent on the agenda. However, there are several things Trump has established in favor of the crypto industry. He has verbally supported crypto during his campaign. He noted, ‚ÄúThe United States will be the Crypto Capital of the Planet and Bitcoin superpower of the world.‚Äù This statement caused Bitcoin to take off on a parable trajectory. He has also established a crypto-friendly administration. DJT appointed a pro-crypto Vice President-elect in JD Vance. He also nominated Paul Atkins as SEC chairman, a co-chairman of the Token Alliance at the Digital Chamber, a prominent blockchain trade association, and a crypto advocate that the crypto industry loves. The price of Bitcoin surpassed $100,000 soon after Atkins‚Äôs nomination. DJT then congratulated the crypto community, saying, ‚ÄúCongratulations Bitcoiners!!! $100,000!!! You‚Äôre welcome!!!‚Äù Screenshot of a post from President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs Truth Social account.

37423335,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108304,1733750146,TON-Based Tap-to-Earn Games Struggle with Retention Due to Repetitive Gameplay,"Despite a bullish cryptocurrency market, TON-based tap-to-earn games are grappling with significant user retention challenges. According to a recent report by BeInCrypto, leading games such as Hamster Kombat, Notcoin, and Catizen have witnessed a sharp decline in active users. Specifically, active wallets on the TON blockchain have plummeted from over 1 million in September to less than 500,000 by December. A Chainplay survey further highlights that repetitive gameplay is the primary reason behind this downturn, with over 51% of players citing monotonous tasks as their main reason for quitting. Decline in User Engagement The rapid decrease in active wallets within the TON blockchain indicates a broader issue of declining user engagement across tap-to-earn platforms. Despite the overall positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, these games are unable to maintain a steady user base, leading to concerns about the sustainability of the tap-to-earn model on Telegram-based platforms. Key Statistics: Active Wallets Drop: From 1 million in September to less than 500,000 by December. User Retention Issues: Over 51% of surveyed players quit due to repetitive tasks. Leading Games Affected: Hamster Kombat, Notcoin, and Catizen among the most impacted. Repetitive Gameplay: The Core Issue A significant factor contributing to the decline in user retention is the repetitive nature of gameplay . Tap-to-earn games often rely on simple, repetitive tasks to reward players with cryptocurrency or in-game assets. While this model initially attracts users with the promise of easy earnings, the lack of variety and engaging content quickly leads to player fatigue and boredom. Insights from Chainplay Report The Chainplay survey sheds light on player dissatisfaction, revealing that: Monotonous Tasks: A majority of players find the repetitive nature of tasks unengaging. Lack of Incentives: Insufficient rewards or progression systems fail to motivate sustained participation. Gameplay Variety: Limited diversity in game mechanics reduces long-term appeal. Impact on TON Blockchain Ecosystem The decline in user engagement within tap-to-earn games has broader implications for the TON blockchain ecosystem . As these games are significant drivers of transaction volume and blockchain utilization, their downturn can affect the overall health and growth prospects of the TON network. Economic Implications: Reduced Transaction Volume: Fewer active users translate to lower transaction activity on the blockchain. Investment Concerns: Declining user engagement may deter new investments and partnerships within the TON ecosystem. Developer Challenges: Game developers may struggle to innovate and attract players without a substantial user base. Strategies to Improve Retention To address the retention challenges, developers and platform operators need to implement strategies that enhance user engagement and diversify gameplay experiences. 1. Introducing Game Variety Incorporating diverse game mechanics and challenges can keep players engaged for longer periods. Features such as missions, quests, and varying levels of difficulty can add depth to the gameplay experience. 2. Enhanced Reward Systems Developing more robust reward systems that offer meaningful incentives can motivate players to continue participating. This could include tiered rewards, exclusive in-game items, or higher earnings potential for consistent play. 3. Community Building Fostering a strong community around tap-to-earn games can enhance player loyalty. Interactive features such as leaderboards, tournaments, and social events can create a sense of belonging and competition among players. 4. Continuous Content Updates Regularly updating the game with new content, features, and challenges can prevent the gameplay from becoming stale. Seasonal events, limited-time challenges, and new game modes can keep the experience fresh and exciting. Future Outlook While TON-based tap-to-earn games are currently facing retention issues, the potential for recovery and growth remains if strategic measures are effectively implemented. The increasing interest in blockchain gaming and the evolving nature of the cryptocurrency market present opportunities for these platforms to reinvent themselves and better cater to player preferences. Potential Developments: Integration of NFTs: Incorporating non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can add unique value to in-game assets, enhancing player ownership and investment. Cross-Platform Compatibility: Expanding beyond Telegram to other platforms can increase accessibility and user reach. Advanced Gamification: Leveraging advanced gamification techniques can create more engaging and interactive gameplay experiences. Conclusion The decline in user retention among TON-based tap-to-earn games highlights the critical need for innovation and diversification in the blockchain gaming sector. Repetitive gameplay and lack of engaging content are major hurdles that need to be addressed to sustain and grow the user base. By implementing strategic enhancements such as varied game mechanics, robust reward systems, and community-building initiatives, tap-to-earn platforms on the TON blockchain can overcome current challenges and pave the way for a more vibrant and sustainable gaming ecosystem. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, the success of tap-to-earn models will depend on their ability to adapt and offer meaningful, engaging experiences to users. Developers and platform operators must prioritize creativity and user-centric design to ensure long-term viability and growth within this competitive market.

Whale Alert, a prominent whale-tracking resource, first called the public‚Äôs attention to the recent development. The analytical platform confirmed in a recent post that the whale initially held a balance of 870,019 DOGE. Whale Alert on X Whale Alert on X The distribution campaign, which began on Dec. 7 at 11:41 UTC, started with the offloading of 50,000 DOGE. Further, the whale moved an additional 100,000 DOGE tokens and then transferred several batches of 67,500 tokens. After this, it then moved out 450,000 DOGE.Possible DOGE SelloffInterestingly, the address sent all the assets, totaling 870,000 tokens, to Coinbase, America‚Äôs largest crypto exchange. This move was likely an effort toward cashing out on his investment after eleven years of holding the assets.¬†However, the latest development has had very minimal impact on the Dogecoin market, as DOGE remains largely unperturbed. Despite this, the market is currently down as the asset has slumped 5% over the past 24 hours due to a broader crypto market collapse.¬†On-chain data shows that the address began accumulating Dogecoin in its early days. Notably, the wallet received the 870K tokens between December 2013, about two weeks after the launch of Dogecoin, and January 2014.¬†The address received the assets in several uneven batches, with the first inflow involving 67,500 DOGE on Dec. 21, 2013. Afterward, the wallet then witnessed three more batches of 67,500 tokens as inflows across several minutes on the same day.At the time of the transactions between December 2013 and January 2014, Dogecoin traded at an average price of $0.0007. This indicates that the tokens were procured with a meager $609. Eleven years later, the whale has now dissolved the investment at a price of $391,889, representing an ROI of 64,249%.Dogecoin Eyes Second PushThis massive return comes despite Dogecoin‚Äôs recent pullback. Notably, market analysts insist that the meme coin is still on the verge of another parabolic upsurge. A prominent analyst Kevin believes the next leg will come up soon, with targets at $3.8 to $4.Interestingly, while this address dumped, larger investors have been accumulating more tokens in anticipation of this upsurge. For instance, late last month, some whales procured 550 million DOGE tokens amid a price drop. Another set of addresses amassed 160 million tokens in mid-November.¬†Meanwhile, Dogecoin has held above the pivotal $0.40 psychological support amid the ongoing market correction. The meme coin is down 5.92% over the past 24 hours, currently trading for $0.4345 at press time.",NEUTRAL,DOGE,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/09/ancient-dogecoin-whale-with-870k-doge-reawakens-after-11-years-as-doge-slumps-5/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ancient-dogecoin-whale-with-870k-doge-reawakens-after-11-years-as-doge-slumps-5,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

As the cryptocurrency nears its historic price threshold, a shift in market dynamics could soon catch traders offside, especially if the current buy-side demand begins to fade. Long-term Holders Cashing Out According to data from CryptoQuant contributor Maartuun, long-term holders ‚Äî defined as wallets that have held Bitcoin for over 155 days ‚Äî have sold an alarming 827,783 BTC since November 8. At Bitcoin‚Äôs current price of approximately $99,200, this amounts to roughly $82.6 billion in offloads. This large-scale selling has sparked concerns that the market may be reaching a top, especially given that these holders are sitting on significant unrealized profits, with an average gain of around 400%. Retail Demand and ETF Inflows Keep Bitcoin Strong While prominent buyers like MicroStrategy and Bitcoin ETFs have added to their holdings ‚Äî with MicroStrategy purchasing 149,800 BTC and ETFs seeing 84,193 BTC inflows over the same period ‚Äî Maartuun points out that these inflows represent only a fraction (roughly 30%) of the sell-offs by long-term holders. ‚ÄúThe overall market is much larger than just them,‚Äù Maartuun said, adding that retail traders, particularly those involved in Bitcoin futures, are also playing a significant role in the market‚Äôs current dynamics. Bitcoin‚Äôs Open Interest (OI), which tracks the total number of unsettled derivative contracts, stood at a hefty $61.2 billion as of early December. Profit-Taking and Liquidity Concerns The growing concern is the impact of long-term holders exiting the market . Many are sitting on massive profits, with Bitcoin‚Äôs Long-Term Holder realized price ‚Äî the average price paid by long-term holders ‚Äî sitting at $24,481. As Bitcoin approaches $100,000, this sell-side pressure could signal a top, particularly if retail demand begins to taper off. Analysts are already sounding the alarm. On December 6, Real Vision‚Äôs chief crypto analyst, Jamie Coutts, pointed to worsening liquidity conditions, which could soon dampen the rally. His Bitcoin MSI macro model suggests that while Bitcoin is hitting all-time highs (ATHs), the market is operating in a deteriorating liquidity environment. If this trend worsens, the current euphoria could soon give way to a downturn, with the rally potentially running out of steam sooner than expected.

This marked a 111 percent rise from its summer lows under $50,000. However, the rally was followed by a sharp 14.84 percent correction , including a rapid 10 percent drop within just eight minutes‚Äîthe largest pullback from a present ATH since the pre-election sell-off. The correction triggered over $1.1 billion in liquidations, of which $419 million were in Bitcoin long positions, underscoring the level of leverage in the market. Despite this volatility, signs of market stabilisation are emerging. The Realized Profit metric , which peaked at $10.5 billion daily, has fallen to $2.5 billion, easing sell-side pressure. Futures funding rates have also normalised, signalling reduced speculative leverage. And while ETF inflows slowed slightly towards the end of last week, they remain a critical source of support amid ongoing long-term holder profit-taking. As Bitcoin consolidates above $100,000, the mid-term outlook remains bullish, and with normalising funding rates and slowing sell-side pressure, further upward momentum is likely, provided ETF inflows continue. The latest US economic data threw up some mixed results last week, but overall showed that the economy continues to look resilient. November saw a strong rebound in job creation , with 227,000 jobs added, exceeding expectations despite disruptions from October‚Äôs hurricanes. However, a slight rise in unemployment to 4.2 percent suggests lingering workforce shifts. October job openings surged to 7.74 million, highlighting sustained demand for labour, although hiring slowed, reflecting employer caution amid economic uncertainties. Meanwhile, the service sector marked its 51st consecutive month of growth in November, though at a slower pace, with the PMI at 52.1, supported by robust consumer spending and wage growth. Inflationary pressures persist, but easing supply chain bottlenecks and strong year-end expectations point to stability. As the Federal Reserve evaluates potential policy shifts from the new incoming administration, the economy remains anchored by a resilient labour market and steady consumer demand. Uneven recovery across sectors however, signal the need for cautious optimism. In crypto news last week, South Korea experienced a dramatic surge in crypto trading , with $34 billion recorded in just 24 hours across leading Korean crypto exchanges, following the declaration of martial law by President Yoon Suk-yeol. The political unrest caused panic sell-offs and platform outages, highlighting the market‚Äôs sensitivity to geopolitical instability. Bankrupt exchange Mt. Gox also transferred $2.4 billion worth of Bitcoin to a new wallet, just as Bitcoin rose above $100,000 for the first time. And Grayscale joined the competitive race to launch a Solana ETF , filing to convert its Solana Trust as SOL rallied. These events illustrate the dynamic interplay of political, regulatory, and historical factors shaping the evolving crypto landscape. Have a good trading week!

The report offers an in-depth analysis of digital asset trends and predicts significant growth in Bitcoin adoption, Ethereum‚Äôs resurgence, and the integration of stablecoins into traditional financial systems. The firm anticipates 2025 as a pivotal year for the sector, driven by increased institutional interest, U.S. regulatory advancements, and favorable macroeconomic conditions.

The report highlights Bitcoin‚Äôs growing stature as a strategic reserve asset. It projects that more nation-states will follow El Salvador‚Äôs lead in embracing Bitcoin as part of their financial strategy. Argentina is identified as a potential candidate for such adoption. This shift indicates a broader acceptance of Bitcoin‚Äôs role beyond a store of value, as 21Shares predicts the cryptocurrency‚Äôs total value locked (TVL) will exceed $10 billion in 2025. Moreover, according to the report, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is also set for a renaissance in 2025. After stagnation, Ethereum‚Äôs revenue growth is expected to rebound significantly, surpassing 100% of its target. The resurgence will be driven by strategic Layer 2 integrations , which will ultimately enhance scalability and utility. Adrian Fritz, Head of Research at 21Shares, emphasized the shifting dynamics in global markets. He noted that while Europe has led the charge in digital asset adoption, the United States is rapidly emerging as a formidable player. ‚ÄúIn 2025, we expect the market to become even more positive towards crypto, spurred by a more favorable regulatory environment under a new administration that will likely accelerate crypto adoption, and growth for the industry at large, at a pace we‚Äôve never seen before.‚Äù Adrian Fritz ETP and Stablecoin Growth Amid War Against Bitcoin Reserve The report also projects explosive growth for crypto ETPs, forecasting assets under management (AUM) to reach $150 billion by 2025. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and similar regulatory changes worldwide are expected to drive this momentum. With institutional investors showing an increased appetite for regulated exposure to crypto assets, at least one U.S.-based Bitcoin ETF is anticipated to rank among the top 25 largest ETFs globally. Stablecoins , often touted as the bridge between traditional finance and blockchain technology, are another focal point of 21Shares‚Äô outlook. These digital assets are expected to see deeper integration into public and private sectors, with nation-states, banks, and Web2 companies adopting stablecoins for various use cases. Notably, the idea of a country-owned Bitcoin reserve is gaining momentum. On Friday, December 6, a report showed that Florida is exploring the creation of a statewide Bitcoin reserve , aiming for a potential launch in early 2025. While there has been praise, there have also been some cautions. Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has criticized President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs proposal to establish a national Bitcoin reserve, calling it impractical and politically motivated. Trump‚Äôs plan involves retaining 200,000 Bitcoins from past asset seizures, and advocates suggest it could reduce the national debt through value appreciation. Summers, however, dismissed the idea as a misplaced financial strategy, questioning why the government would accumulate Bitcoin as a ‚Äústerile inventory.‚Äù Former Federal Reserve Bank of New York President Bill Dudley recently criticized the idea , claiming it is a ‚Äúbad deal for Americans.‚Äù The post 21Shares‚Äô 2025 Outlook Predicts More Bitcoin Adoption and Ethereum Resurgence appeared first on Cryptonews .",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | MARKET,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/21shares-2025-crypto-outlook/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37425647.jpeg

This rally to a new PEPE all-time high was driven by increased whale activity and accumulation. Whale Accumulation Fuels PEPE‚Äôs Bullish Momentum Data shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez on social media platform X highlights that PEPE whales recently added $1.14 billion in PEPE to their holdings, pushing the total whale-controlled amount to $7.56 billion. This plays into a bullish run over the weekend, which saw PEPE‚Äôs market cap surpass $10 billion for the first time. At the time of writing, PEPE has a market cap of about $11.17 billion, meaning this holder cohort now controls about 67% of the total market cap. Related Reading: Technical Analysis Puts XRP Price Above $5 In Next 3 Days, Whales Buy $288 Worth Of XRP Interestingly, on-chain data shows the surge in whale accumulation didn‚Äôt just start yesterday. IntoTheBlock‚Äôs Balance By Holdings In USD metric shows a 30-day increase of 147.81% in the holdings of addresses holding more than $10 million worth of PEPE tokens. These large holders have been on an accumulation trend, with a massive $1.14 billion purchase coming in on December 7 alone. Other holder cohorts have also significantly expanded their positions over the past month. Addresses holding between $1 million and $10 million worth of PEPE recorded a 119% increase in their holdings during this period, while those holding between $100,000 and $1 million saw a 108% rise. Mid-tier investors with holdings between $10,000 and $100,000 registered an 84.25% growth in their balances, while even smaller holders with $1,000 to $10,000 worth of PEPE saw their holdings increase by 55.29%. This increase in accumulation from all cohorts has increased the buying pressure on PEPE, which in turn has allowed the meme cryptocurrency to surge in value by 150% in the past 30 days. Exchange Listings And Accessibility Boost PEPE‚Äôs Popularity Another notable driver behind PEPE‚Äôs record-breaking performance is its growing accessibility after listing on major crypto exchanges. PEPE has been added to crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Robinhood, and Binance US in the past few days, which has significantly increased its exposure to retail and institutional investors in the US These listings have made it easier for a broader audience to trade and invest in the meme cryptocurrency.

37422887,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373979,1733749107,Experts Predict Ethereum‚Äôs Clear Path to ATH Amid Bullish Structural Shifts,"Ethereum has been struggling to clear the $4,000 resistance. It suffered fresh declines of around 3% on Monday that pulled its price down to $3,850. Despite this, experts suggest that a new peak could be just around the corner owing to a strong weekly close. Ethereum ATH Soon? Pseudonymous crypto trader Pentoshi‚Äôs analysis suggests that Ethereum is experiencing significant ‚Äústructural shifts,‚Äù similar to Bitcoin‚Äôs recent developments. ETH has just recorded a higher high and achieved its highest weekly close of the year, signaling strong upward momentum. According to Pentoshi, the absence of substantial resistance between the current price and its all-time high suggests that the leading altcoin may be drawn toward this level, much like a ‚Äúmagnet.‚Äù Beyond this critical milestone, he sees a clear path for further growth, with minimal barriers to sustained upside potential. This could be supported by the growing presence of large ETF flows, signaling increasing institutional interest in Ethereum. Ethereum surpassed the $4,000 price level last week for the first time since March 2024, yet its all-time high of $4,878, recorded in November 2021, remains untouched. The subsequent corrections further sent the price lower. But, on-chain data reveals few resistance levels ahead, indicating Ethereum is positioned to challenge this previous all-time high. Additionally, Bankless podcast host Ryan Adams also suggested in a recent X post that a new Ethereum all-time high ‚Äúcould happen‚Äù within the coming week. However, not everyone foresees a new record for Ethereum this year. While crypto trading firm QCP Capital maintains a bullish outlook on Ethereum, it predicted that the price action will remain range-bound during the holiday season. Historically, it peaks in January post-halving, a sentiment mirrored in the options market with calls favored after that. Ethereum‚Äôs ‚ÄúJump or Die‚Äù Moment Ethereum is currently retesting a critical three-year trendline, with the next price movement holding significant implications. If the cryptocurrency manages to bounce off this line, it could trigger a rapid and volatile rally, pushing prices to new highs. However, if the price fails to hold and breaks below this level, one analyst predicts that Ethereum could revisit the $3,500 range. This moment is described as a ‚Äújump or die‚Äù scenario for the token.

37425644,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318137,1733749022,Australian Blockchain and Crypto Firms See 14% YoY Decline in 2024,"Australia‚Äôs blockchain and cryptocurrency sector faced a significant downturn in 2024, experiencing a 14% year-on-year decline, according to KPMG‚Äôs Australia Fintech Landscape 2024 report . The study revealed that over 7% of the country‚Äôs fintech companies ceased operations this year, with the blockchain and crypto markets hit the hardest. Australia‚Äôs Fintech Sectors Shrinks For Second Year The number of fintech firms in Australia has been shrinking for two consecutive years, falling from 800 in 2022 to 767 by December 9, 2024. Of the 60 companies shutting this year, 14% were from the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. ‚ÄúThe blockchain and cryptocurrencies space was the hardest hit in the Australian fintech landscape, decreasing by 14% YoY with 74 active firms as of 2024.‚Äù Approximately 4.5% of the closures were attributed to firms shutting down, while 3% resulted from mergers and acquisitions (M&A). KPMG said many of these M&A deals stemmed from buyers‚Äô strategic efforts to strengthen specific business capabilities. The report also pointed to the growing interest in artificial intelligence, which has contributed to the decline in blockchain and crypto firms. However, KPMG suggested that recent pro-crypto developments, such as the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, could help revive the sector in 2025. Additionally, expected U.S. interest rate cuts and a rising demand for alternative investments may encourage the establishment of new crypto-focused businesses in the coming year. Meanwhile, regulatory developments in Australia indicate increased scrutiny of the crypto industry. Last week, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) released a consultation paper proposing a comprehensive licensing framework for most crypto firms. We have released a consultation paper outlining proposals to update our digital asset guidance: https://t.co/PR6k2KDgY7 pic.twitter.com/a3tuRbxOVR ‚Äî ASIC Media (@asicmedia) December 3, 2024 Shortly after, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) flagged crypto as a priority for the year ahead. The agency plans to create a task force to crack down on crypto ATM providers that may be flouting Anti-Money Laundering laws. Kraken Raises Concern About Lack of Regulatory in Australia In September, Kraken raised concerns about Australia‚Äôs lack of regulatory clarity following a Federal Court ruling against its fiat margin trading product. The exchange said Australian crypto businesses and investors continue operating in a ‚Äúconfusing and uncertain regulatory environment.‚Äù The exchange claimed that the court‚Äôs decision underscores the broader issue of regulatory ambiguity in the country‚Äôs approach to cryptocurrency. ‚ÄúThis ruling makes it clearer than ever that bespoke crypto regulation is urgently needed.‚Äù Despite Australia‚Äôs increased crypto scrutiny, crypto adoption is still growing. As reported, the country has one of the highest rates of cryptocurrency adoption globally, ranking 9th out of 26 countries for crypto adoption. The crypto ownership rate in Australia is 17% , which is higher than the global average of 15%.

The NFT market is witnessing a revival, with sales rising to new highs, led by Ethereum‚Äôs dominance. However, some challenges persist. This is evidenced by the large number of NFT scams targeting artists and Kraken‚Äôs decision to close its NFT marketplace to focus on other services. Despite this, other NFT projects are still growing. Yuga Labs plans to enhance NFT utility through its acquisition of Tokenproof. Pudgy Penguins Surpasses Bored Ape Yacht Club Pudgy Penguins, the well known non-fungible token (NFT) project, surged past Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) to claim the position of the second-largest NFT collection by market cap. Over the past 24 hours, Pudgy Penguins‚Äô floor price climbed by 8.4%, reaching 22.1 ETH, or¬†$86,922. It also saw an impressive 44.9% increase over the week, according to data from CoinGecko. This growth propelled its market cap to $772.5 million, surpassing BAYC‚Äôs $755 million. CryptoPunks still dominate the NFT space with a market cap of $1.5 billion. Top 10 NFT projects by market cap (Source: CoinGecko ) The remarkable rise in Pudgy Penguins‚Äô value happened after the project‚Äôs announcement regarding the upcoming launch of its official token, ‚Äú Pengu .‚Äù The token is set to debut on the Solana network later this month, and will have a total supply of 88,888,888,888 tokens, with 25.9% earmarked for the Pudgy Penguins community. An NFT is a unique digital asset that represents ownership or proof of authenticity for a specific item, like artwork, music, videos, or virtual goods, on a blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum, which are fungible and interchangeable, NFTs are one-of-a-kind and cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis. Their uniqueness and ownership details are secured through blockchain technology, which makes them quite popular for digital collectibles and other applications. Despite the NFT market experiencing a downturn compared to its peak in 2022, there are signs of recovery. NFTs Surge in December NFTs started December with strong momentum, led by Ethereum‚Äôs dominance in digital collectible sales. According to data from CryptoSlam , NFTs generated more than $187 million in sales volume during the first week of December, surpassing November‚Äôs strongest week that recorded $181 million. This growth continues the upward trend that started back in October after a challenging period where NFT volumes declined since March to reach a low in September with the worst monthly sales since 2021. October was the beginning of a recovery, which culminated in a 57% month-on-month increase in November, with over $562 million in NFT sales. Ethereum maintained its leadership position among NFT blockchains by recording $92 million in sales last week. This was a 44.69% increase from the previous week. This surge was largely driven by popular collections like Pudgy Penguins and CryptoPunks. NFT collections by 7 day sales (Source: CryptoSlam ) Pudgy Penguins saw $25 million in sales, reflecting a staggering 346% weekly increase, according to DefiLlama . CryptoPunks followed with $16.5 million in weekly sales, with its floor price briefly hitting 44 ETH on Dec. 4 before settling at 40 ETH, worth about $160,000. Bitcoin-based NFTs ranked second after Ethereum after recording $43.8 million in sales. Other blockchains, including Solana, Immutable, Mythos Chain, Polygon, Cardano, and Flow, collectively contributed $47 million in weekly sales. ETH‚Äôs price action over the past 7 days (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Ethereum‚Äôs NFT resurgence coincided with a price breakout for ETH , which surged above $4,000 on Dec. 6 to reach a high of $4,067. Fake NFT Websites Target Artists While the NFT market is picking up some steam, so are NFT crimes. Brooklyn‚Äôs District Attorney announced the closure of 40 fraudulent NFT marketplace websites after a case where an 85-year-old artist was scammed out of $135,000. The victim was approached on LinkedIn by someone posing as an art dealer, who convinced him to mint his artwork on a fake NFT marketplace that mimicked the New York-based OpenSea platform. The scammer claimed the artist earned $300,000 in profit but required a $135,000 ‚Äúfee‚Äù to access the funds. The artist ended up liquidating his retirement account by using credit cards, and took out a loan to pay the fee. Unfortunately, the artist soon realized that the promised payout was a scam, which left him financially and emotionally devastated. District Attorney Eric Gonzalez stated that the case led investigators to uncover a network of fraudulent websites that are specifically targeting artists. His office believes that shutting these domains and raising awareness is crucial to prevent similar scams. Warning signs of NFT scams (Source: The Brooklyn District Attorney's Office ) The investigation revealed that funds were traced to accounts in Nigeria, where they were then converted to local currency. The fake websites were controlled from Nigeria, and often asked users to input their crypto wallet seed phrases. This allowed scammers to empty the contents of their wallets. Two other artists from Georgia and California were also victims of the same scam. The District Attorney‚Äôs Virtual Currency Unit urged artists to use established NFT marketplaces, avoid revealing their crypto wallet seed phrases, and stay aware of phishing attempts. It also warned that offers that seem too good to be true often are. Yuga Labs Strengthens Its NFT Ecosystem with New Acquisition Yuga Labs, the blockchain company behind the BAYC and ApeCoin, acquired the technology and part of the team from Tokenproof, a Web3 tokenization service specializing in verifying NFT ownership in real-world scenarios. Tokenproof‚Äôs founder and CEO, Fonz O , confirmed the acquisition on Dec. 3. Yuga Labs co-founder Greg Solano praised Tokenproof‚Äôs contributions, and admires their joint efforts in solving complex problems to enhance the utility of NFTs, like enabling BAYC holders to access global events. As part of the acquisition, Tokenproof‚Äôs tech team will join Yuga Labs‚Äô research and development division, The Workshop. The division was established in August during a period of layoffs and company restructuring. The Workshop is focused on advancing projects like Otherside, Yuga‚Äôs gamified and interoperable metaverse. The acquisition is part of Yuga Labs‚Äô strategy to make cryptocurrency tokens and NFTs a lot more accessible and engaging. Community members and developers are also excited about the move and Tokenproof‚Äôs role in adding real-world utility to NFTs. The NFT market¬†faced many mixed developments over the past few months. In November, NFT sales volume exceeded $562 million, reaching a six-month high. However, overall market conditions are still a bit uncertain, which was made evident through the closure of Kraken‚Äôs NFT marketplace less than a year after its launch. According to Kraken, the decision was made to reallocate resources toward new products and services. Kraken also assured its users that they could transfer their NFT collections to Kraken Wallet or a self-custodial wallet.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6432/pudgy-penguins-floor-price-soars-and-market-cap-surpasses-bayc,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

37422865,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624816,1733748456,Switzerland prepares to reveal findings on Credit Suisse‚Äôs collapse,"Switzerland is about to drop one of its most highly anticipated reports: the findings from its investigation into Credit Suisse‚Äôs shocking collapse in 2023. The report, led by the Parliamentary Investigation Commission (PUK), will get deep into the chain of events that caused the downfall of one of the nation‚Äôs banking giants. Apparently, this is about holding people accountable and reshaping how Swiss banking operates moving forward. The Swiss government has already drafted proposals for stricter financial regulations, including massive capital requirements for UBS, which swallowed Credit Suisse in a rushed deal. But here‚Äôs the thing: while the rest of the world‚Äôs banking hubs are easing up on regulations, Switzerland is leaning in hard. The PUK‚Äôs unprecedented power The PUK is Switzerland‚Äôs nuclear option when it comes to investigations. This commission can drag in witnesses, demand confidential documents, and get to the root of problems in a way few other political tools can. In the 18 months since its formation, the PUK has grilled over 60 key players. So far, it has spoken to Swiss National Bank officials, Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) regulators, and top executives from both Credit Suisse and UBS. The central question? How did regulators and the government allow Credit Suisse to spiral out of control? The commission isn‚Äôt wasting time picking apart every management mistake; instead, it‚Äôs digging into how the system itself failed. Was the forced sale to UBS really the best option, or was it a panic move by the government to save face? What steps did regulators take‚Äîor fail to take‚Äîbefore the bank was shoved into UBS‚Äôs arms? According to insiders, FINMA, the Swiss financial regulator, could come out of this looking the worst. Critics have long said the agency didn‚Äôt act fast or decisively enough. FINMA, of course, claims its hands were tied by legal limitations. But that argument might not hold up if the report uncovers missed opportunities to intervene before things got out of hand. UBS braces for impact For UBS, this report could be a nightmare. The worst-case scenario involves regulators demanding 100% capital backing for UBS‚Äôs foreign subsidiaries. Translation: UBS might need to come up with an extra $25 billion in capital. That would put the bank at a severe disadvantage compared to its global competitors, cutting into profits and possibly making investors rethink their confidence. UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher and CEO Sergio Ermotti have been vocal about their opposition to this level of regulatory overreach. They‚Äôve argued that Switzerland‚Äôs financial rules are already among the toughest in the world and that more regulation could crush the competitiveness of the country‚Äôs banking sector. They‚Äôve also made it clear they‚Äôre ready to roll with most of the government‚Äôs proposed changes ‚Äî just not the ones that hit them where it hurts the most. UBS isn‚Äôt waiting around for lawmakers to decide its fate. The bank is already overhauling its emergency protocols, making sure it won‚Äôt end up in a Credit Suisse-style crash. The Swiss finance minister has hinted that UBS‚Äôs plans could influence how much extra capital it will ultimately need to hold. Finger-pointing and fallout The PUK report is expected to name names, and some big ones are already in the spotlight. FINMA President Marlene Amstad is under scrutiny for her agency‚Äôs failure to act aggressively when the warning signs at Credit Suisse were impossible to ignore. Swiss newspaper Blick has hinted that FINMA will take the brunt of the blame. Then there‚Äôs Ueli Maurer, the former finance minister. Just three months before Credit Suisse‚Äôs collapse, he confidently told the public the bank would ‚Äúget its act together.‚Äù Now, the PUK has extended its investigation timeline all the way back to 2015‚ÄîMaurer‚Äôs entire tenure. That‚Äôs not a good sign for him. His successor, Karin Keller-Sutter, might escape unscathed since she only stepped into the role in 2023. But let‚Äôs not forget: she played a key role in negotiating the UBS takeover, so she‚Äôs not completely out of the woods. The SNB isn‚Äôt off the hook either. Former chief Thomas Jordan could face heat for how the central bank handled Credit Suisse‚Äôs liquidity needs during the crisis. Critics say the SNB‚Äôs rigid collateral requirements added unnecessary pressure on the bank. The SNB, for its part, denies this and says it‚Äôs already expanding its liquidity regime to avoid a repeat disaster. Past PUK investigations have ended careers. One 1996 probe into a pension fund scandal accused the finance minister of ‚Äúwillful deception.‚Äù Don‚Äôt be surprised if this report leads to similar political casualties.

While an asset jumping over 300% in a short time can often spark broad expectations of significant corrections, many still believe that XRP has significant gas left in the tank .An Explosion Waiting to Happen? ""Love it or hate it, the XRP explosion will begin unexpectedly,"" prominent XRP influencer ""Amonyx"" asserted in an X post on Sunday, December 8, surmising the bullish sentiment surrounding the asset.Along with this statement, Amonyx shared a chart showing that despite the latest rally above $2, XRP has traded within a range over the past seven years when viewed from a larger timeframe, particularly over a 1-month period. Data confirms that XRP slipped into this range after it soared to claim the $3.31 all-time high in January 2018. The chart, which the analyst presented to tickle the fantasy of XRP holders, suggests that XRP has unlimited upside potential should it break above the range.Charts and views like this around XRP are not new, as core proponents and 'permabulls' have long prophesied that the asset was due for a face-blistering run. Still, many believe this time is different, as prominent analysts are also sharing these significantly bullish views .XRP to $20?Recently, crypto analyst ""BarriC"" suggested that XRP is getting ready for another leg up with a potentially astronomical target.For context, XRP is trading at the $2.40 price point at the time of writing, representing a 4.8% decline in the past 24 hours. A price jump to $20 will represent an almost 1,000% gain from current prices.Still, BarriC has suggested that the price target could be even higher if recent bids for XRP ETFs get the SEC's green light in 2025.XRP's recent rally comes as the dark regulatory cloud that has long hindered its prospects appears to be clearing , with the broader crypto industry anticipating more friendly conditions under the incoming Donald Trump administration.",POSITIVE,XRP,MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/09/pundit-predicts-unexpected-xrp-explosion-as-xrp-eye-more-gains/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pundit-predicts-unexpected-xrp-explosion-as-xrp-eye-more-gains,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

37425160,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/ripples-xrp-364-growth-candle-in-november-is-this-just-the-beginning,1733747990,Ripple's (XRP) 364% Growth Candle in November: Is This Just the Beginning?,"For Ripple (XRP), November 2024 has been a historic month as the token soared 364%. Many investors wonder if this spike is only the start as XRP keeps gathering strength and reaches a live price of $2.38 as of writing. Experts see another 270% increase in XRP before Christmas, positioning its amazing expansion to continue. Though XRP's recent success has drawn interest from the crypto market, another token, Rexas Finance (RXS), is also generating waves with its outstanding presale performance and future promise. XRP ranks #4 on CoinMarketCap at the time of writing, with a market capitalization of $135.9 billion and a circulation supply of more than 57 billion units. XRP's ascent is amazing, given a 24-hour trade volume of over $21 billion. Still, the fast-expanding Rexas Finance platform is poised to outshine XRP as it rises. Rexas Finance has already jumped 320% in presale; as of writing, the token currently costs $0.125 per RXS in stage 9, up from $0.030 in stage 1. Rising above $22.9 million, the presale indicates great investor confidence and future expansion possibilities. Why Rexas Finance Is a Strong Prospective in the Crypto Domain? Built on a community-centric strategy, Rexas Finance has followed a different path by eschewing venture capital funding in favor of assembling a committed set of individual investors. Rexas Finance's smart decision to list on big sites like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, therefore greatly increasing its visibility, only serves to magnify this. Targeting sectors including real estate ($379.7 trillion market value), commodities like gold ($121.2 trillion), and the art industry, estimated at $65 billion yearly, the project's unique characteristic is its emphasis on actual asset tokenization. Whether full ownership or fractional, this creative solution lets anyone tokenize assets, democratizing access to valuable investments. By bypassing conventional limits, Rexas Finance transforms how individuals might invest in real-world assets with only a click. Rexas Finance is flexible and adaptive for a broad spectrum of assets since its ecosystem supports token standards, including ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155. With its easy-to-use tools, the Rexas Token Builder and Launchpad, among others‚Äîeveryone can design and generate money for tokenized assets without coding knowledge. As it grows, the platform will likely take a sizable chunk of the trillion-dollar market. The Presale and RXS's Future The token price is expected to rise by another 60% before the official release as Rexas Finance prepares for the last phases of its presale. Three out of the top 10 tier-1 exchanges will shortly feature the coin, improving its liquidity and accessibility. With an anticipated token price of $0.20 at launch, Rexas Finance's presale success is expected to extend into 2025 and present a major chance for early investors to realize large gains. The Certik audit helps investors learn more about the platform's security and reputation, even though the total quantity of the token is limited to 1 billion RXS. The ongoing $1 million giveaway, which has drawn over 389,000 entries as of writing, offers an opportunity to win $50,000 in RXS, inspiring people to become involved and raising their chances of success. Twenty random winners will be rewarded with $50,000 worth of RXS each. Participants can increase their chances of winning by completing tasks on the Rexas Finance website and sharing about the giveaway on social media. Conclusion: Why Investors Should Look to Rexas Finance Although XRP's amazing 364% increase in November is impressive, Rexas Finance is becoming a major rival with its creative approach to actual asset tokenizing. With a great presale performance, a strategic community-driven approach, and the support of big exchange listings, Rexas Finance is positioned for a big leap into 2025. Now is the moment to use Rexas Finance's presale to optimize your crypto investments before it's too late. Investing in RXS now could pay out handsomely, given that RXS is priced cheaply at $0.125 as of writing and is currently up 320% from its stage 1 price of $0.030, which is expected to rise to $20 in the next bull run. Join the revolution of actual asset tokenization to reserve your place in the crypto future.

El Salvador expects to reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund over the next two to three weeks on a $1.3 billion loan program in exchange for changes to its leading use of Bitcoin as legal tender and reduced government deficits, according to two people familiar with the talks. An IMF mission has arrived in San Salvador to iron out details of the deal with President Nayib Bukele's government, according to the FT. Under the agreement with the IMF, El Salvador will lift the requirement for businesses to accept Bitcoin as a payment method and make it voluntary.

When most traders and investors think of risk, they refer to sizing and downside potential. However, many don‚Äôt understand that one of the biggest risks to a trade can be their own lack of conviction. The saying ‚Äúconviction can not be borrowed‚Äù applies to users who either copytrade or tail trades of people they consider smart or influential. Those who tail trades are usually unable to handle it when price action moves against them as the trade idea isn‚Äôt original, or the trader lacks conviction. Often, this leads to closing a trade or position for a loss or selling too early. Low conviction in a trade leads to poorly handled capital, and if repeated over and over again, is a surefire way to lose significant amounts of money. So, the ability to understand your own personal conviction in trades you enter needs to be a necessary part of the risk analysis process.

37422159,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108506,1733747027,Movement Network Foundation Announces Launch of Movement Mainnet Beta and $MOVE Token Generation Event,"GRAND CAYMAN, Cayman Islands, Dec. 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ ‚Äî The Movement Network Foundation , the organization dedicated to fostering innovation and advancing the adoption of MoveVM technology, today announced the successful launch of Movement Labs ‚Äò Movement Mainnet Beta and the Token Generation Event (TGE) of $MOVE , marking a significant milestone for the first Move-based blockchain that settles to Ethereum. The launch of Mainnet Beta represents the first phase of Movement‚Äôs production infrastructure. During this phase, infrastructure providers can deploy essential network components including follower nodes, RPC nodes, and indexers. Network operators will focus on two critical tasks: ensuring the network properly synchronizes and validating security measures. This managed launch environment sets the foundation for Movement‚Äôs innovative ‚Äú postconfirmations ,‚Äù which achieve transaction finality in as little as one second ‚Äî dramatically faster than existing ethereum scaling solutions that can take minutes or even day. Movement Foundation is launching the $MOVE token, via its MoveDrop program, distributing up to 1 billion $MOVE tokens (10% of maximum supply) to its community.¬†The MoveDrop rewards meaningful participation and genuine technical contributions. The program is designed to build a community-driven network where token holders can actively participate in securing the network‚Äôs infrastructure and governance, reflecting Movement‚Äôs commitment to sustainable ecosystem development. Unlike next-gen Layer 1 blockchains that operate in isolation‚ÄîMovement introduces a solution designed to enhance Ethereum‚Äôs possibilities. Movement directly integrates with Ethereum, leveraging its robust network effects and security while simultaneously expanding the pool of secure and innovative applications. Through Movement, all Move developers inherently become Ethereum developers. ‚ÄúWhat sets Movement apart is our vision for true utility on Ethereum,‚Äù said Rushi Manche, Co-founder of Movement Labs. ‚ÄúBy bringing the Move language to EVM, we‚Äôre not just creating another L2, we‚Äôre building a bridge that transforms every Move developer into an Ethereum developer, dramatically expanding the ecosystem‚Äôs potential.‚Äù At the core of Movement‚Äôs appeal is the Move programming language, developed for Meta‚Äôs Diem project and celebrated for its enhanced safety and expressiveness. Move‚Äôs resource-oriented programming model aims to ensure secure and bug-resistant smart contract development ‚Äî eliminating over 90% of auditor-prioritized attack vectors. ‚ÄúMovement‚Äôs strength lies in our vibrant community of over 800 builders and 840+ contributors who have been with us on this journey,‚Äù said Cooper Scanlon, Co-founder of Movement Labs. ‚ÄúMainnet Beta launch and MoveDrop are about empowering developers and users to shape the future of Ethereum scaling. Whether you‚Äôre building on the Movement Network, testing new protocols, creating content, or participating in governance, there‚Äôs a place for everyone in our ecosystem.‚Äù To celebrate this milestone, Movement Network Foundation also announced its first-ever NFT initiative ‚Äì a community-driven competition to create the official commemorative artwork for the Mainnet Beta launch. ‚ÄúOur community has been essential in building the Movement, so it‚Äôs only fitting they should create the artwork that commemorates this historic moment,‚Äù added Scanlon. ‚ÄúThis genesis NFT will be a testament to the creative power of our ecosystem.‚Äù The winning design will be minted as Movement‚Äôs first NFT, with the top three submissions receiving $1,000 prizes.

37422000,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373982,1733746776,Ethereum Price Analysis: Here‚Äôs What Next for ETH After Getting Rejected at $4K,"Ethereum‚Äôs price is in a critical zone near $4K, facing resistance but also showing signs of consolidation. While the market remains bullish overall, short-term fluctuations within the $3.5K-$4K range are expected before a potential breakout or deeper pullback. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Ethereum has made impressive progress, surging toward the psychological $4K resistance region. This price level coincides with Ethereum‚Äôs yearly high and is a strong area of selling pressure. Recently, the rejection at this line has caused a slight decline, signaling that the resistance is proving difficult for buyers to overcome. After the correction, the market entered a period of low volatility, suggesting a short-term consolidation phase. This phase could last within the $3.5K-$4K range as buyers and sellers reach a standoff. The RSI indicator‚Äôs bearish divergence supports the notion of an overbought market, reinforcing the likelihood of this corrective stage. While the price has faced some resistance, ETH buyers will likely make another attempt to push past $4K. However, before that, a period of sideways movement is expected as the market digests the recent gains. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, ETH maintains a bullish market structure, consistently forming higher highs and higher lows. Despite the rejection at $4K, the overall trend remains upward, as Ethereum has been trending within an ascending price channel. The failure at the $4K resistance zone has led to a period of consolidation, with the asset hovering just below this critical level. The lower boundary of the ascending channel, currently around $3.7K, provides short-term support. If the price continues to maintain it, a bullish surge toward the $4K threshold is likely. On the other hand, a break below the channel‚Äôs lower trendline could indicate weakening bullish momentum, with a possible pullback toward the $3.5K support level in the mid-term. However, if buyers manage to defend it, another attempt to break $4K could be imminent. Onchain Analysis By Shayan Ethereum‚Äôs Funding Rates metric, reflecting futures market sentiment, has surged to its highest level in months, coinciding with a significant price rally. This highlights strong bullish sentiment, with traders anticipating new all-time highs. However, the market may require a correction to sustain this momentum. Funding rates are at levels last seen in January 2024, when Ethereum rallied by 88%. This reflects increased long-position interest as optimism grows. Similar to January, this sharp increase suggests the likelihood of a pullback, allowing the market to stabilize and avoid excessive volatility. While Ethereum‚Äôs rally is underpinned by bullish sentiment, the spike in funding rates signals the need for a short-term correction, paving the way for healthier and more sustainable price growth.

His strategy is looking at new projects that could experience exponential growth, such as Ripple. Out of these investments, Rexas Finance (RXS) is an important one, with its novel real-world asset tokenization. Of these digital assets, the trader has expressed optimism in their ability to generate, if not surpass, the trader's success in the past. How Rexas Finance Transforms Real-World Asset Investments Rexas Finance's innovative real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platform garners serious investor attention. Rexas uses blockchain technology to tokenize physical assets, like real estate and gold, so that users can partially own them. With just a click of a button, investors can now purchase fractions of luxury properties, such as restaurants in Europe and properties in Asia. Rexas has emerged as a game-changer in the finance industry, demolishing the barriers that have prevented the acceptance of decentralized systems into industries dominated by centralized systems. Rexas allows people to digitise and tokenize their assets using its user-friendly token builder, whether technically skilled or not. Not only is it a platform for asset owners, but the Launchpad also connects innovators with investors, bridging project creators with global capital. Advanced tools such as the Quickmint Bot and GenAI improve the tokenization process by recovering tokens quicker and adding security to the market. Rexas brings us these features, eliminating some challenges that have held back blockchain adoption in the traditional markets. It has a tokenomics model backed by long-term growth with a capped supply of 1 billion ERC-20 tokens. Already, investors in the presale have contributed over $21 million, and there is strong demand and confidence in the platform‚Äôs future success. Filecoin (FIL) Filecoin (FIL) solves the problem of secure, private data storage with a decentralized solution. As a network, it uses empty storage space as a resource and creates a system where users can safely store data while remaining private. The addition of Aethir to Filecoin enhances its position in Web3 storage solutions, for instance, those for AI and data heavy applications. Filecoin provides users with a transparent and decentralized alternative to traditional cloud services. Businesses and individuals that rely on robust data management solutions need a scalable and secure platform. As digital storage needs continue to expand, Filecoin will be a key player in an evolving landscape of what we once called Web3. Aptos Token (APT) Aptos (APT) is notable for its speed and scalability, which makes it perfect for high-performance blockchain applications. Aptos, built using the Move programming language, offers faster transaction processing at lower costs than what‚Äôs common with many other blockchains. This makes it a versatile solution for developers and investors alike that can support decentralized finance (DeFi) as well as NFTs. Aptos also integrates Stripe for real-world payment processing, which fortifies its place in the blockchain space. Because Aptos has grown rapidly as an institution and developer, demand for robust blockchain solutions with the capabilities to address the needs of large applications has increased, and Aptos is well-placed to become the leader in this sector. Solana (SOL) With its phenomenal scalability, speed, and low transaction costs, Solana (SOL) has taken off. These characteristics make it a favorite block synthesized for DeFi, NFTs, and gaming applications. Solana‚Äôs institutional interest is only growing, and an ETF may soon be approved, consolidating the project‚Äôs long-term potential. Solana can operate very high-volume transactions at very low costs, which is very attractive to developers and investors. Supported by strong institutional support and its continued growth, it consolidates its role as one of the top players in the blockchain ecosystem.

Airdrops have proven to be a great way for new projects to stand out and reward their communities. One of the most exciting airdrops happening right now comes from Jupiter , one of the leading decentralized exchanges (DEX) on the Solana blockchain. Their second round of airdrops is now underway and will continue until January 2025, giving crypto enthusiasts the chance to claim free JUP tokens. The process is simple: swap Solana coins on Jupiter‚Äôs platform and meet the eligibility requirements. Jupiter‚Äôs $1.4 Billion Airdrop Proposal Recently, Jupiter passed a successful proposal to continue its airdrop events for another two years under the name ‚ÄúJupuaries.‚Äù This proposal will allocate $700 million worth of JUP tokens per year over the next two years, adding up to $1.4 billion . The community showed strong support, with 87% of the 360 million votes cast voting in favor of this plan.

Key Changes to the Airdrop Program Jupiter is introducing a few important changes to improve its airdrop system: Unclaimed JUP Tokens to Active Users: Any unclaimed tokens will be redistributed through a rewards pool, focusing on active users who stake their tokens. Anti-Bot Features: The new system will include safeguards to prevent bots from exploiting the airdrop. Rewarding Engagement: The aim is to reward users who actively use the platform instead of opportunistic traders. These changes follow a failed attempt at a similar proposal in the past.

37422404,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51716,1733746436,Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Slams 60 Minutes. Here‚Äôs why,"Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has criticized 60 Minutes for how it portrayed cryptocurrency and Ripple in a segment aired recently. Following the broadcast, Garlinghouse took to X to address key omissions and what he saw as a misrepresentation of crypto‚Äôs utility. He highlighted that despite speaking with Margaret Brennan for over 90 minutes, crucial points‚Äîsuch as the federal court ruling of July 2023 about XRP security status were left out. Garlinghouse described this omission as ‚Äúshocking,‚Äù especially given the ruling‚Äôs significance in Ripple‚Äôs legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Crypto made its debut on @60Minutes tonight ‚Äì there‚Äôs no doubt that these technologies will continue to become more and more mainstream ‚Äì with influence and reach that will only continue to grow. A few things I do want to comment on after watching: I spoke with Margaret‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 9, 2024 60 Minutes Ignores Important Details He criticized the program for airing comments from John Reed Stark, a former SEC official, who dismissed cryptocurrencies as a ‚Äúscourge‚Äù and implied they primarily facilitate illicit activity. Garlinghouse rejected these claims, calling Stark a ‚Äúshill‚Äù for SEC Chair Gary Gensler, and argued that Stark‚Äôs comments ignored the real-world utility of blockchain and digital assets. Garlinghouse also rebuked 60 Minutes for perpetuating outdated narratives about crypto. He compared these to early misconceptions about the internet when skeptics dismissed it as a platform for illegal activities. He noted that doubts have been disproven by blockchain‚Äôs adoption in mainstream financial institutions. Specifically, Garlinghouse pointed to Ripple‚Äôs success in conducting billions of dollars worth of transactions for institutional clients using XRP, which facilitates efficient, KYC-compliant cross-border payments . Additionally, Garlinghouse emphasized that Ripple‚Äôs work directly contradicts claims that crypto lacks utility. He highlighted that even traditional financial giants like JPMorgan are increasingly adopting blockchain technology . Despite this, 60 Minutes failed to recognize Ripple‚Äôs contribution to modernizing global payment systems. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Call for Regulatory Clarity During the interview, Garlinghouse also reiterated his long-standing call for regulatory clarity in the U.S. He criticized the SEC‚Äôs approach as misguided, arguing that it stifles innovation and mischaracterizes crypto assets like XRP. According to him, existing laws do not adequately address the unique nature of blockchain technology, creating unnecessary confusion and legal challenges. Garlinghouse‚Äôs frustration reflects broader dissatisfaction within the crypto industry about media narratives and regulatory uncertainty. His critique of 60 Minutes shows the need for balanced discussions that acknowledge blockchain‚Äôs transformative potential while addressing legitimate concerns. For Ripple, the omission of key points from a high-profile interview, which was initially seen as a positive development , marks a missed opportunity to correct public misconceptions about the technology.

Since its September 8, 2024 presale, the project has garnered attention. Stage 9 of the presale is 92% complete, and the RXS token is worth $0.125, up 316% from $0.03. Over 310 million tokens have been sold, raising $23.3 million. Rexas Finance's asset tokenization method is unique. The platform makes it easy to convert RWAs like real estate, commodities, and art into digital tokens. This innovative technology offers fractional ownership, liquidity, and global accessibility. Investors have access to assets previously reserved for the wealthy or institutional investors. With its ecosystem, Rexas Finance supports both expert and novice users, not simply asset tokenization. The platform is more accessible because tools like the Rexas Token Builder let users create digital tokens without coding. Rexas Launchpad provides decentralized funding for new cryptocurrency initiatives, while Rexas GenAI generates unique NFTs. These innovations establish Rexas Finance as a one-stop shop for digital assets and decentralized financing. The project's market potential is high. The tokenization of RWAs provides $121.2 trillion, $379.7 trillion, and $486 trillion markets for commodities, real estate, and financial assets. Rexas Finance also offers a $1 million giveaway to early adopters. Each of the top 20 candidates will get $50,000 RXS. This offer encourages early investors and may boost token demand. The project aims to list on at least three tier-1 exchanges to increase visibility and liquidity. Investors rejoice. If RXS enters major exchanges at $0.20, investors could profit from its presale price of $0.125. TRX: Tron Ride Bullish Momentum Another solid flan in the veteran trader pot is Tron (TRX). Its core coin, TRX, experienced a surge of 70% in 24 hours, reaching a peak of $0.45. The coin‚Äôs price increased by 94% over the course of last week to $0.38. Cause of this incredible rally? TRX surges during heavy market activity, with daily trading volumes topping $14.6 billion, a 510% spike from the previous day. The altcoin reentered the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, surpassing Avalanche (AVAX) at $32.8 billion. Many analysts expect TRX's latest climb to last until 2025. On the rise, Tron founder Justin Sun said the project is still going strong after six years. Analysts are optimistic about TRX's future due to market strength. Blockchain analyst Mihir expects TRX to reach $1.80 based on its trajectory. Javon Marks and other experts expect the token will climb 369% to $1.11. Not all analysts are hopeful. The pseudonymous expert Team Lambo warns that TRX may correct to $0.33. Rising TRX futures open interest suggests traders expect the uptrend to continue. Conclusion The veteran investor who made millions with DOGE and SHIB is betting on Rexas Finance and Tron in 2025. Rexas Finance offers a game-changing asset tokenization solution, while Tron benefits from its strong community and market momentum. Rexas Finance (RXS) is a promising investment. With its upcoming exchange listings and growing sector, RXS might be a crypto giant.

37421826,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624848,1733746227,Sushi CEO Jared Grey pitches big year in 2025 with roadmap updates,"Sushi‚Äôs DAO‚Äôs CEO, Jared Grey (aka head chef), took to X (formerly Twitter) to share Sushi‚Äôs plans for 2025 as well as the project‚Äôs accomplishments in 2024. In April 2024, Sushi DAO, the community governance structure behind SushiSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Ethereum blockchain, implemented a far-reaching governance overhaul. It led to the establishment of the Sushi DAO Foundation and Sushi Labs to enhance the multi-token ecosystem. 2025 will be an eventful year for Sushi From the looks of things, 2025 is shaping up to be a busy year for Sushi . According to Grey‚Äôs X post, there are plans to launch several new products in 2025, including Wara, Susa, Kubo, and Blade, all of which will upgrade Sushi‚Äôs trading services and market reach. With some of these products, Sushi will also attempt to franchise its brand and product stack into new ecosystems, such as Solana in order to promote its influence beyond Ethereum-based platforms. One of the products Grey teased is the Susa , a new perpetual DEX that will utilize the N1 network to optimize the performance of on-chain order books to promote trading efficiency. Speaking about another product, Wara exchange , Jared Grey described it as a new comprehensive trading experience for traders on Solana. As a new Solana DEX, it will be competing to knock off more prominent names like Raydium and Orca. Unlike Raydium and Orca, Wara exchange could set itself apart by integrating degenerate trading features. The memecoin market and its traders are a very active and dominant crypto demographic, and they have maintained a stranglehold on narratives since the bull run officially started. Grey presented Sushi Labs‚Äô new perps primitive, Kubo , as a creation to bootstrap new markets via delta-neutral strategies. He also teased Blade as a part of SushiSwap. He described it as a new LVR AMM solution that eliminates MEV for blue-chip assets. Finally, there‚Äôs the SushiSwap aggregator, which is already in production. According to Grey, the project has plans to scale its distribution by integrating new partners. Sushi‚Äôs accomplishments in 2024 Grey cited the ‚Äúcomprehensive governance overhaul‚Äù that SushiDAO passed in April 2024 as he talked about the project‚Äôs achievements this year. One of the accomplishments Grey mentioned was the finalization of the Sushi DAO Foundation and Sushi Labs to formalize and promote Sushi DAO‚Äôs interests via a multi-token ecosystem. He also mentioned the usage of the multi-token ecosystem mandate to launch new Sushi products, some of which will be ready next year. The CEO discussed expanding the Sushi brand and product stack into new ecosystems like Solana to expand SushiSwap‚Äôs reach beyond its native EVM roots. Grey‚Äôs post noted the launch of its new perps DEX, Susa. Grey offered an explanation for those who wanted to know why Sushi opted to build another perp DEX: ‚ÄúThis one is built on N1 , the most performant network for on-chain order books,‚Äù he said. This year, Sushi Labs also received autonomy to expand SushiSwap into aggregation. Grey claims a report will be released later this week to prove that SushiSwap is the most distributed and performant aggregation. SushiDAO recently proposed liquidating all its SUSHI tokens to diversify its treasury. The plan, which is pending a governance vote, involves reallocating the treasury into 70% stablecoins, 20% blue-chip cryptocurrencies and 10% other DeFi tokens. The DAO expects the plan to reduce volatility and boost liquidity. There has also been talks about the Sushi Labs model, which involves the transfer of over $40 million DAO-controlled treasury assets to a new entity exclusively controlled by Sushi Labs. The proposal was met with mixed reactions with many expressing concerns about centralization and how the community will be carried along. While some see the fund as a wise strategy to manage risk, others see it as a potential threat to the intrinsic value of the ecosystem‚Äôs governance tokens.

37422723,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318090,1733746202,Crypto Scam Targets Web3 Workers with Fake Meeting Apps,"Web3 workers are being targeted by a sophisticated phishing scam that uses fake meeting apps to steal sensitive information and crypto. According to a report by Cado Security Labs , the attackers employ AI to craft convincing websites, blogs, and social media profiles for fictitious companies. These platforms are then used to lure victims into downloading malware-infected applications under the guise of legitimate business opportunities. The malware, known as the Realst info-stealer, operates on macOS and Windows systems and steals credentials, financial details, and crypto wallet information. Cado Security Labs has discovered a new malware campaign targeting Web3 workers with a sophisticated scam using AI-generated content to appear legitimate. Read more in our latest blog post: https://t.co/Pj8Y82kaKY ‚Äî Cado (@CadoSecurity) December 6, 2024 Web3 Workers at Risk: How Are They Being Targeted? The attackers behind this campaign have created an elaborate fa√ßade of legitimacy by establishing fake companies with names like ‚ÄúMeeten‚Äù and ‚ÄúMeetio.‚Äù Source: Cado Security These entities change their branding frequently, cycling through domains such as ‚ÄúClusee.com‚Äù and ‚ÄúMeeten.us.‚Äù The scammers use AI to generate detailed websites filled with blog posts, product descriptions, and social media accounts to appear credible. These platforms mimic the professionalism of real businesses, making it challenging for victims to distinguish between legitimate and malicious actors. Once a target is identified, the attackers initiate contact through various methods, including direct messages on Telegram. In many cases, they impersonate individuals known to the victim, using stolen personal details to bolster their claims. For instance, some victims reported receiving messages from what appeared to be colleagues or professional acquaintances, only to discover later that the accounts were fake. In one notable case, a victim was shown an investment presentation from their own company, which the attackers had stolen and repurposed to lend credibility to the scam. After securing the victim‚Äôs trust, the scammers direct them to a well-designed website where they can download the purported meeting application. Unbeknownst to the victim, the software contains the Realst info-stealer, which immediately begins extracting sensitive information from the user‚Äôs device. Even before the malware is installed, the fraudulent websites deploy malicious JavaScript to siphon crypto stored in web browsers. How the Malware Steals Data The Realst info-stealer is a sophisticated piece of malware that operates on both macOS and Windows systems, with versions tailored to each platform. Source: Cado Security Once installed, it combs through the victim‚Äôs device to extract a wide range of data, including Telegram credentials, browser cookies, banking details, and cryptocurrency wallet information. The malware targets popular browsers such as Google Chrome, Brave, and Microsoft Edge and wallet services like Ledger, Trezor, and Binance. The malware disguises itself on macOS as a legitimate package file, often called CallCSSetup.pkg. When executed, it prompts the user for their system password under the pretence of resolving an error. It then uses this access to collect and exfiltrate sensitive data. The stolen information is compressed into a zip file and sent to remote servers controlled by the attackers. The Windows variant, on the other hand, uses an Electron framework-based application called MeetenApp.exe. This version employs advanced obfuscation techniques, such as Bytenode-compiled JavaScript, to evade detection. Like its macOS counterpart, it collects system information and sensitive data before transmitting it to the attackers. Both malware versions have high technical sophistication, with features designed to ensure persistence on the victim‚Äôs device and evade security tools checks. Notably, a similar technical attack happened to the Solana ecosystem earlier this month. A critical vulnerability was discovered in the Solana/web3.js library that can leak private keys through seemingly legitimate CloudFlare headers.

Where would the best levels for a bounce be? $DOGE price in a bullish ascending triangle Source: TradingView The $DOGE price in the short time frame is looking quite good. A rejection at $0.47 was probably to be expected, and the price is now heading back down. The 0.382 Fibonacci at $0.43 has already been touched, and now it remains to be seen whether the price will continue further down. Favourite level for a bounce is possibly $0.41, or a wick down to the 0.618 at $0.395 is also a possibility. The ascending trendline could also provide some support. One very bullish factor to notice is that the price is possibly within an ascending triangle. These patterns are generally very bullish, and so it might be expected that the $DOGE price could indeed bounce from the bottom trendline of this pattern. If $DOGE does succeed in breaking to the top of this potential ascending triangle, the measured move would be to $0.58. A possible flag retest for $PEPE Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for $PEPE shows that the price recently broke out of a flag. While the measured move for the flag is still a long way off, a correction is going to come first. This correction could take the price all the way back to retest the top of the flag at $0.000022, and there is even the possibility that the price could come back inside this pattern. $0.000021 at the 0.618, and $0.000019 at the 0.786, are also possible bounce levels. Potential W formation for $WIF Source: TradingView The daily chart for $WIF is showing that the price is falling fast. There is some support at the current price level, but stronger support is below at $3.19. There is also the possibility that the price goes further down to the support at $2.95. If a bounce does take place at one of these two levels, there is the potential for the formation of a big W chart pattern. This could send $WIF much higher if it should play out. A cautionary note One major factor to consider, and this goes for all the three memecoins mentioned above, is that the weekly Stochastic RSIs are at, or very near the top. This means that there is the potential for a longer term pull back. The indicator lines could stay at the top for quite some time, but it is certainly a cautionary note for future price action.

Fan tokens, tied to football teams, connect the model of meme assets with already existing fandoms. Fan tokens, assets tied to high-profile football clubs, are becoming one of the growing trends in crypto. Trading activity for the token category spiked from baseline levels in what analysts consider a pivot to a new class of assets. After suffering from limited attention for a long time, fan tokens have emerged as an overlooked source of growth. They start from a low market cap below $300M, lagging far behind the meme market. Fan tokens are making a comeback with surge in trading volumes. | Source: Coingecko In the past week, many top fan tokens saw 10X growths in trading volumes, surging past $500M in 24 hours. Most top tokens also experienced short-term price spikes. Why are fan tokens making a comeback? Fan tokens became famous during the Euro Cup in the summer of 2024. However, t he Chiliz ecosystem renewed its efforts to boost the adoption in December, adding apps to the ecosystem. Our Fan Tokens have sparked a movement. üåü Now, with new dApps on the Chiliz Chain, we're connecting iconic teams and millions of fans to Web3. This is SportFi in action. #ChilizChain ‚ö°Ô∏è $CHZ pic.twitter.com/DxR31UPRZ3 ‚Äî Chiliz ‚Äì The Sports Blockchain ‚öΩüèÜ (@Chiliz) December 8, 2024 The project revamped its tokenomics, increasing the CHZ supply, with the goal of creating a SportFi sector based on already existing fan tokens. Chiliz also added a merch layer and additional perks, directly targeting already established fan token users. After years of slow adoption, Chiliz set out on a social media mission to put more sports fans on-chain. It is using rewards , airdrops, and points mining to generate renewed interest among sports fans. The growing token activity is also drawing the attention of crypto insiders, who provided the increased trading volumes. Fan tokens are also a replacement for celebrity assets, which often have brief successes before falling into obscurity. In comparison, these sports-inspired tokens are less exciting, with less susceptibility to aggressive pumps and rug pulls. Binance started the sports fan token trend with a dedicated launchpad Binance actively supported the issuance of fan tokens through a dedicated launchpad. Some of the tokens it supported include LAZIO, PORTO, SANTOS, and ALPINE. The exchange Binance Fan Tokens was also dedicated to boosting utility and organizing events for those assets, though most of the activities were phased out in the past few months. Other assets use the Chiliz ecosystem, a long-running blockchain dedicated to sports fandom products. Sports tokens were initially a relatively niche ecosystem and were meant to facilitate activities for the team and fans. Fan tokens helped in fundraising, incentives, community-building, and unlocking various tiers of privileges. They can also be used for voting or spent on NFT markets. Outside their immediate utility, fan tokens are simply responding to hype, aiming to pump their still relatively low market capitalization. Still, they hold an advantage over memes ‚Äì a long-running history, an identity, and limited incentives to rug pull. Their low volumes make them volatile, but they also have a higher potential upside during rallies. Chiliz ecosystem hopes for a recovery The recent altcoin rally lifted the value of Chiliz (CHZ) by 100%, from $0.06 to $0.12. CHZ is also starting to recover its trading volumes. A more active Chiliz ecosystem may also boost the adoption of Socios and its list of fan tokens. These types of assets have been around since 2019, with various levels of adoption. Fan tokens also suffered during the bear market and disillusionment of 2022, as they became an afterthought for many clubs. However, the current bull market and emerging Web3 technologies have led to renewed demand. The renewed interest in altcoins and memes is already reflected in search trends , with a sudden spike in activity at the end of November. The other factor driving traffic to Chiliz is its emerging DeFi ecosystem. Chiliz holds just $16.68M in value locked, with emerging DEX and the Azuro prediction market. For now, fan tokens only have a hypothetical role in DeFi, but those assets are relatively reliable and can be included in additional pools.

The blockchain and cryptocurrency sector has been the hardest hit, marking a stark decline in the number of active firms. The findings , as part of KPMG‚Äôs Australia Fintech Landscape 2024 report, reveal that the number of independent fintech firms in the country has dropped from 800 in 2022 to just 767 in December 2024. Australia fintech sector sees a major decline The study highlights that a considerable portion of the closures can be attributed to the blockchain and crypto sector, with 14% of the 60 Australian fintech firms that shut down this year falling into this category. Specifically, the number of active blockchain and cryptocurrency firms has dropped by 14% year-over-year, with only 74 companies remaining. The KPMG report attributes much of this decline to the sector‚Äôs struggle to compete against the growing interest in artificial intelligence, which has become a more prominent focus for many fintech firms. The overall fintech contraction in Australia also reflects a broader trend of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the market. Around 3% of firms closed their doors due to M&A activity, with strategic purchases aimed at strengthening certain capabilities. However, KPMG suggests that despite the challenges, the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries may have a chance to rebound in 2025. This potential recovery could be fueled by global events like the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., alongside anticipated U.S. interest rate cuts, which could spark a renewed interest in alternative investments and provide a much-needed boost to the sector. Government‚Äôs Growing Focus on Crypto Regulation The Australian regulatory environment is also becoming more stringen t, adding pressure to an already struggling market. In early December, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) proposed a sweeping financial licensing regime for cryptocurrency firms. The consultation paper, issued on December 4, suggests that nearly all crypto businesses in Australia may soon need to adhere to stricter financial regulations. Furthermore, Australia‚Äôs national financial intelligence agency, AUSTRAC, has announced plans to focus its efforts on the cryptocurrency industry in 2025. AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas emphasized that crypto ATMs have become a major concern for money laundering, and the agency intends to clamp down on illegal activities within the sector. While these regulatory changes might pose additional challenges for crypto firms, they could also help bring about a more secure and transparent operating environment.

According to on-chain data from Arkham Intelligence, the Royal Government of Bhutan has purchased nearly 14,000 Bitcoins since early 2021, signaling a strategic move into the cryptocurrency market. Slowing Down Bitcoin Purchases However, in recent months, Bhutan‚Äôs pace of Bitcoin accumulation has slowed. In the past two months alone, addresses linked to the Royal Government of Bhutan have sold more than 1,000 Bitcoins. Earlier today, the government transferred 406 Bitcoins, worth around $40 million , to QCP Capital. Bhutan now holds approximately 12,000 Bitcoins, making it the seventh-largest BTC holder among countries with strategic Bitcoin reserves. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Marathon Digital Expands Bitcoin Holdings with $130 Million BTC Purchase , Measuring Success with Gross National Happiness Unlike most nations that measure economic growth with Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Bhutan uses Gross National Happiness (GNH) to assess the well-being of its people.

37421545,https://nulltx.com/?p=135448,1733745722,ETHEREUM PRICE ANALYSIS & PREDICTION (December 9) ‚Äì ETH Loses Grip Above $4k After Dropping 2% Daily But Bigger Moves Lies Ahead,"The past week was impressive as Ethereum revisited ATH following a steady monthly recovery. Looking strongly bullish weekly, it is down today as it searches for solid rebound support. A breakout is underway. During last the bullish cycle, Ethereum signalled a wild altcoins rally as volatility flew from the primary cryptocurrency while consolidating. That pattern is likely to repeat this bull season as ETH sets to break the genes again after recovering fully back to the top last week. It managed to reach the $4,084 level but saw rejection and fell slightly to where it is changing hands at around $3,931 at the time of writing Although the past month of trading has been rough following a choppy price movement from the $3,000 level compared to a major move from the $2,400 range. While still maintaining a higher high and higher low pattern on the lower timeframe, the choppy price actions indicate an incoming huge rally, and from the look of things, the price will likely break higher soon. Such a breakout should trigger a massive altcoins season as it rallies to a new all-time high. As of now, it is looking for a close support level to bounce back. Once that happens, we can expect a break-up. ETH‚Äôs Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Looking at the daily price actions, the $3,000 level has become a strong support for Ethereum in the past month. If the price drops below the close $3,760 support, the lower level to consider for a drop is $3,497, followed by the $3,255 level. Once ETH recovers from the current drop, it must successfully cross above the $4,094 high before considering the next major rally to $4,500 and $5,000 in the near term. It may end the bull run with a new ATH of $7,000. Key Resistance Levels: $4,094, $4,500, $5,000 Key Support Levels: $3,760, $3,497, $3,255 Spot Price: $3,931 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

37421550,https://crypto.news/?p=14317161,1733745660,Five verification needs when tokenizing RWAs | Opinion,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news‚Äô editorial. Tokenization of real-world assets‚Äîthe process of creating digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership of a traditional financial asset‚Äîpromises to change the way we invest in and trade everything from real estate and fine art to government securities and corporate bonds. You might also like: The future of RWA tokenization: A call for standardized verification | Opinion The bridge between tradfi and DeFi allows a broader set of investors to transact complex assets from anywhere in the world, lowers fraud risk through enhanced transparency, and enables instant global trading of previously illiquid assets. Though still a tiny fraction of the overall finance world, this $13 billion market is racing toward a projected $30 trillion valuation over the next decade. As Wall Street and the blockchain universe start tokenizing more of our financial infrastructure, we face a critical challenge: how do we reliably verify the link between real-world assets and their digital twins? While blockchain technology provides the foundation for tokenization, it cannot inherently guarantee the integrity of underlying off-chain assets. We need robust verification mechanisms to bridge this physical-digital divide and drive widespread RWA adoption. Here, we discuss five foundational tokenization challenges that verification solves. 1. Asset verification: The foundation of trust Tokenization is only as valuable as the accuracy of the assets it represents. For RWA tokenization to reliably scale, verification systems must establish secure, real-time connections to trusted external data sources. This ensures that every tokenized asset is backed by authentic, verifiable information. Consider a tokenized commercial real estate property. Today, verifying this asset requires constant coordination between multiple parties: legal teams checking ownership documents, auditors conducting inspections, and oracles updating property values. Each step introduces delays and potential failures, making real-time verification nearly impossible. The solution lies in decentralized verification networks that provide automated connections to authoritative data sources‚Äîfrom land registries to regulatory filings. These networks consolidate fragmented verification processes, creating an immutable record of every step, from initial authentication to ownership transfers. Through continuous monitoring, changes in property ownership or valuations are automatically reflected on-chain, enabling truly liquid markets. 2. Digital identity: Establishing legitimacy of participants When transacting with RWAs, knowing who you‚Äôre dealing with is paramount. Advanced verification systems enhance trust in digital identities by making off-chain identity verification processes transparent and auditable. Imagine a multi-million dollar tokenized art transaction. Today‚Äôs identity verification relies on a patchwork of KYC providers, each operating independently and often requiring investors to repeatedly verify their identity across each platform and transaction. An investor from Singapore looking to purchase tokenized artwork from a European gallery might need to complete separate KYC processes for the art platform, the payment provider, and the custody solution‚Äîeach with different standards and timeframes. This fragmented approach creates friction and security vulnerabilities. Advanced verification systems can transform this process by creating a standardized framework where identity verification is executed on decentralized networks. The resulting certified transcript can be trusted across platforms while protecting privacy, enabling seamless participation across various tokenized asset markets. 3. Custody verification: Confirming your assets are where they should be Whether it‚Äôs a vintage wine collection or gold bars, tokenized assets must be physically stored and protected. Think of custody verification as digital proof that your asset exists and is properly safeguarded‚Äîsimilar to how bank statements prove your money is secure, but with real-time verification. Modern verification systems must track every aspect of custody operations, from security measures to storage conditions. Each custody action generates an immutable record, creating a comprehensive audit trail that allows asset owners to verify their holdings at any time. 4. Provenance tracking: Validating ownership history The luxury watch market demonstrates why provenance matters. Tracking a rare Patek Philippe‚Äôs history relies on scattered paper certificates, dealer records, and auction house documentation. This fragmented system enables counterfeiting and can diminish legitimate assets‚Äô value when ownership history becomes unclear. Verification systems must create an unbroken chain of cryptographically secured records. Each transfer of ownership, maintenance record, and authentication check generates a certified transcript on a decentralized network that is both immutable and interconnected. When an authorized dealer in Geneva services a watch, that record automatically becomes part of its verified provenance chain, making it accessible to all future owners. 5. Regulatory compliance verification: Adhering to legal frameworks The complexities of regulatory compliance are clearly visible in tokenized securities trading. Take a tokenized corporate bond trading between investors in different jurisdictions. Today, checks are manual and retrospective‚Äîa trade might be executed only to discover days later that it violated regulations, requiring costly reversals. Traditional systems struggle with transactions crossing jurisdictions, where requirements vary dramatically. Decentralized verification systems can integrate smart contracts with regulatory frameworks to automate compliance checks. Each verification generates a portable transcript, creating an immutable audit trail for regulators. These transcripts can be linked to ledger transactions or used off-ledger, simplifying the compliance demonstration process and fostering a more transparent and trustworthy ecosystem. The verification imperative The future of RWA markets depends on developing comprehensive verification systems that address these five requirements. These systems must be scalable, cost-effective, and capable of handling diverse asset types. Through advanced cryptographic techniques and verified decentralized compute networks, we can create reliable bridges between physical assets and their digital representations. Widespread adoption of RWAs hinges on our ability to verify reliably. Without robust, scalable verification systems, we‚Äôll be left with a system that‚Äôs only marginally better than traditional finance.

42416972,f450a5cd-fca8-4331-91ea-c6b506e87ff2,1733745600,Crypto Daybook Americas: BTC Hits Mid-Cycle Peak as Retail Interest in Altcoins Soars,"By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)  The crypto market has begun the week on a negative note, with bitcoin (BTC) lower after a weekend spent wrestling with the $100,000 mark amid reports that Amazon shareholders are pushing for an allocation to the cryptocurrency. The persistent indecisiveness since Dec. 5 amid increased retail participation has some indicators pointing to a mid-bull cycle top.  For example, BTC's value days destroyed (VDD) indicator, a velocity gauge, has jumped to 2.0 from 0.5, signaling that older coins are being sold. As the founder of 10x Research, Markus Thielen, points out, ""This often reflects profit-taking by long-term holders, a behavior typical in the later stages of a bull market."" Luckily for the bulls, VDD is still below the critical 3.8 level, marking the end of previous bull markets. The popular MVRV ratio supports this idea, rising to 2.7x in a move Thielen calls a hint of a mid-cycle peak where many investors contemplate taking profits.  Meanwhile, MicroStrategy's CEO Michael Saylor faced a backlash on social media for urging the U.S. to replace gold with BTC in its reserves, leaving America's enemies with a worthless asset. At least that's an improvement compared with the maxi narrative of late 2020 that suggested BTC would replace the USD, or is it? The cheesy take has some wondering whether the bullish cycle is about to peak.  Ether is also feeling the pressure, posting even larger losses than bitcoin and dampening hopes for a recovery in the ether-bitcoin ratio. Despite this, retail interest remains robust, with open interest in ETH perpetuals rising to $843 million on leading decentralized exchange Hyperliquid, exceeding BTC's $616 million. This follows record inflows of $836 million into ether ETFs last week.  ""This indicates significant retail interest in ETF flows,"" said Toe Bautista, a research analyst at GSR. ""Most carry trades are on CME versus Hyperliquid, so this interest seems to reflect sticky retail capital that could fuel the next leg up.""  On a positive note for ETH, the DeFi sector, which primarily operates on Ethereum, is booming. Last week, TradingView's DeFi market cap index surged over 28% to $151.9 billion, its highest since early 2022. This increase has reduced ether's inflation rate to 0.3% and was accompanied by a 71% rise in DEX trading volumes, a 39% increase in network revenue and a 20x surge in total blob fees.

PEPE has gained more than 23% in the past seven days, with trading volumes increasing from an average of $2 billion to over $8 billion in that period.  That move made the token the first among the relatively new memes from 2023 ‚Äî a cohort that includes bonk, dogwifhat, and mog, among others ‚Äî the first to eclipse a landmark $10 billion market cap.  Gains in pepe likely tracked those of ether, which has outperformed bitcoin (BTC) and other major tokens with an 8% rise in the past seven days.  Since late 2023, meme tokens have been increasingly seen as a beta ‚Äî or a leveraged way to bet on the growth of their underlying blockchain.  Some PEPE whales increased their holdings by roughly 1.1 billion tokens over the weekend, suggesting strong institutional or large investor interest in expectations of a higher move, according to Lookonchain data.  Derivatives Positioning  Funding rates in perpetual futures tied to major tokens, including BTC, have dropped to less than 30% from nearly 100% last week. It's a sign that speculative excesses have been crowded out.  While perpetual futures open interest for most major coins has increased over the past seven days, cumulative volume deltas (CVDs) have declined, indicating a net selling pressure.  BTC's options market has seen a strong uptake for the Dec. 13 expiry call at $105,000 and calls at $130,000 and $150,000 expiring in January and March. Calls continue to trade at a premium to puts.  In ETH, an entity financed a large purchase of the $3,200 put expiring on Dec. 27 with a short position in the $4,200 call. The positioning shows expectations for a price drop.

The world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency has gained almost 50% since Trump‚Äôs election victory but is down by 1.25% over the past 24 hours as it consolidates around the $100,000 mark. The crypto market has started the week in the red, with almost all major cryptocurrencies firmly in the red. These include Ethereum (ETH), which is down almost 2%, and Ripple (XRP), down nearly 5%, and Solana (SOL), down almost 4%. Significant losses were also recorded by Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Tron (TRX) , Toncoin (TON), Polkadot (DOT), Stellar (XLM) , and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) .

The latest purchase also demonstrates growing confidence in BTC as an asset for investing and wealth management. BlackRock‚Äôs spot Bitcoin ETF crossed $50 billion in assets under management within 228 days of its launch, highlighting growing interest among traders who want to gain exposure to the asset through regulated commercial products. Spot Bitcoin ETFs also make it easy for entrepreneurs to access cryptocurrency markets without managing wallets or private keys. ‚ÄúLATEST: BlackRock‚Äôs $IBIT bought $253.2M worth of Bitcoin on Dec. 6. That makes a total of $2.6 billion of inflows this week for $IBIT.‚Äù BTC has seen a steady stream of interest from institutions and major corporations, with analysts observing that demand from new shareholders is helping BTC test new highs.

Crypto Industry Frustrated Over Anti-Crypto Commissioner Vote The United States Senate Banking Committee is set to vote on whether to renominate Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, a vocal critic of cryptocurrencies. Industry executives have voiced considerable frustration on the possibility of her re-election. Crenshaw also voted against approving spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. Coinbase president and COO Emilie Choi criticized the potential re-election, stating the ‚ÄúSEC has to change‚Äù in a post on X. ‚ÄúCaroline Crenshaw is anti-crypto.

Committee vote set for next Wednesday.‚Äù Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart stated, ‚ÄúShe wasn't just ""an ally to Gensler"" IMO -- she was more vehemently anti-crypto than Gensler. Just read through her dissent letter on the Bitcoin ETF approvals back in January (The other dem commissioner, Liz√°rraga, didn't even join her on that letter).‚Äù Iran Embraces Crypto To Counter Sanctions Iran has shifted its stance on crypto, focusing on regulation rather than restrictions, according to Minister Abdolnaser Hemmati.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has continued to trade in range as it consolidates before its next big move. Bullish sentiment has waned as the price faces significant resistance around the $101,000 mark. The price had dipped to a low of $90,708 on November 26 but rebounded to clear crucial resistance levels at $96,000 and $98,000, eventually creating history by going above $100,000 and setting a new all-time high of $103,900. BTC started the previous week on a bearish note, registering a drop of 1.25% on Monday and settling at $95,812. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as BTC briefly dipped below the 20-day SMA, dropping to a low of $93,763. However, it recovered from this level to climb above $95,000 and settle at $95,751. The price recovered on Wednesday, registering a substantial jump of almost 3% and settling at $98,851. Thursday saw unprecedented volatility and a historic moment as BTC surged past $100,000. The day began with sellers in control as BTC dropped to an intraday low of $92,285. However, it recovered from this level to surge past $100,000 and set a new all-time high of $103,900 before settling at $97,093. Source: TradingView BTC breached the $100,000 mark again on Friday, rising to an intraday high of $101,911. However, it could not stay above $100,000 and fell to $99,695, registering an increase of 2.68%. BTC remained positive over the weekend, registering a marginal increase on Saturday before rising by 1.32% on Sunday to end the weekend above $100,000 at $101,043. However, BTC has slipped below $100,000 during the current session, with the price down just over 2% and trading at $98,898. So where does BTC go from here? BTC is facing resistance around the $101,000 mark. If it fails to go above this level, we could see a decline, with immediate support around $99,000. The next support levels lie at $97,500 and $95,000. On the other hand, if buyers retake control, BTC could push towards the $105,000 mark. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) struggled to move above the resistance at $4,000, with the price dropping considerably during the ongoing session. ETH started the previous week in the red, falling almost 2% to $3,645. Bearish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as ETH dropped to a low of $3,504. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $3,617, eventually registering a marginal increase. However, ETH made a strong recovery on Wednesday, rising over 6% and going past the resistance at $3,700 to settle at $3,844. The price experienced significant volatility on Thursday as buyers and sellers attempted to take control. As a result, ETH rose to an intraday high of $3,957 and fell to an intraday low of $3,644 before settling at $3,787, ultimately registering a drop of 1.48%. Source: TradingView ETH recovered on Friday as it surged past $4,000 to an intraday high of $4,093. However, it could not stay at this level and declined to $4,003, registering an increase of 5.71%. Saturday saw ETH register a marginal drop as sellers attempted to lower the price, and buyers attempted to push the price higher before ETH settled at $3,999. Sellers tried to take control on Sunday and drive ETH towards $3,800 as the price dropped to a low of $3,924. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $4,007. The current session sees sellers firmly in control, with ETH down over 3% and trading at $3,875. ETH faces resistance at $4,000, a level it is struggling to overcome. If buyers can go above this level, a move to $4,250 could materialize. On the other hand, if sellers retain control, we could see the price drop as low as $3,500. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL started the current week with a substantial decline as selling pressure registered a considerable increase. The altcoin had started the previous week with a significant drop, falling almost 5% to slip below the 20-day SMA and settle at $225, but not before dropping to an intraday low of $219. Sellers pushed SOL to an intraday low of $215 on Tuesday as bearish sentiment persisted. However, SOL recovered from this level to register an increase of almost 4% and settle at $234. Buyers attempted a move past the 20-day SMA on Wednesday as SOL reached an intraday high of $241. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level, and SOL fell by almost 2% to $229. Source: TradingView Volatility increased substantially on Thursday as SOL fell to an intraday low of $221 and reached an intraday high of $244 before dipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $236, registering an increase of almost 3%. Buyers lost momentum on Friday, thanks to the 20-day SMA acting as a dynamic resistance level. As a result, SOL registered only a marginal increase and settled at $237. The weekend was mixed for SOL as it registered a marginal increase of 0.51% on Saturday before dropping by 0.48% on Sunday to settle at $237. However, selling pressure has intensified considerably during the current session, with SOL down almost 4% and trading at $227. If sellers retain control, SOL could drop to $220. A breach of this support level could drive the price to $200. Litecoin (LTC) Price Analysis Litecoin (LTC) has been highly bullish during recent sessions, but momentum waned towards the end of last week, with volatility and selling pressure increasing substantially. LTC surged over 16% last Sunday, going above crucial resistance levels and settling at $119. Bullish sentiment persisted on Monday as LTC rose almost 11% to go above $130 and settle at $132. Despite a strong start to the week, LTC fell to a low of $121 on Tuesday as bearish sentiment returned. The price ultimately settled at $130, registering a drop of 1.43%. LTC registered another dramatic fall on Wednesday as it dropped to $121 before recovering to register an increase of 2.23% and settle at $133.

Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis Chainlink (LINK) started the previous week with an unprecedented surge, registering an increase of almost 34% to go above $20 and settle at $25. However, buyers lost momentum on Tuesday, allowing sellers to take control. As a result, LINK dropped over 4% and settled at $24.12. Buyers attempted a recovery on Wednesday as LINK surged above the resistance at $25 and settled at $26.52. However, it could not stay at this level and fell to $24.10, registering a marginal decline.

Despite a solid 132% return since inception, STCE has underperformed peers like BITQ and FDIG. STCE's index methodology results in significant weights to some relatively small companies. I am bullish on Bitcoin and view Bitcoin ETFs as a better crypto play than STCE. The Schwab Crypto Thematic ETF ( STCE ) is an ETF which seeks to deliver exposure to companies that are poised to benefit from the development or utilization of cryptocurrencies. STCE was launched in August 2022 and currently has $106 million in net assets. The fund has a total expense ratio of 0.30% and currently holds 42 securities. While I expect crypto-related assets to do well in the near term, STCE is not my preferred way to play the sector. Management Fee Is Reasonable STCE charges a total expense ratio of 0.30% which I view as reasonable compared to other funds which offer exposure to the crypto industry. Comparable funds include the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF ( BITQ ) which has an expense ratio of 0.85%, the VanEck Digital Transformation ETF ( DAPP ) which has an expense ratio of 0.51%, and the Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF ( FDIG ) which has an expense ratio of 0.39%. Additionally, STCE's expense ratio is reasonable compared to the suite of recently launched ETFs which hold cryptocurrencies directly. The largest Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) charges a fee of 0.25%. The iShares Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHA ) also carries a fee of 0.25%. Historical Performance Overview As shown by the chart below, STCE has delivered a total return of 132% since inception. While this level of return is solid on a standalone basis, it is less compelling compared to peer funds. In the time since STCE's inception, BITQ has delivered a total return of 159% while FDIG has delivered a total return of 135%. Perhaps the most important thing to note is that all of these funds have significantly underperformed Bitcoin itself, which has delivered a total return of 337% over the same time period. I believe the reason for this is that Bitcoin has received a far greater level of adoption than any other cryptocurrency. There are a few reasons for this including the fact that Bitcoin has a longer history than other cryptocurrencies and has delivered stronger long-term results for early adopters compared to other cryptocurrencies. I expect this trend to continue as Bitcoin is now easier to access, due to the listing of Bitcoin ETFs, relative to other cryptocurrencies. Moreover, it should also be noted that STCE's largest holding, MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), has delivered outsized gains compared to STCE's other holdings (5 largest current holdings shown below.) As a Bitcoin treasury company, MSTR's focus has been on buying Bitcoin. Thus, without the impact of MSTR (which is primarily a price play on Bitcoin itself), STCE's performance relative to Bitcoin would have been even worse. Data by YCharts Data by YCharts Index Methodology STCE seeks to track the Schwab Crypto Thematic Index, which is constructed using a proprietary rules-based methodology. STCE's prospectus outlines the four-step process: 1) Each company in the eligible universe is scored based on its exposure to the Theme, their ‚ÄúThematic Beta‚Äù. Each company‚Äôs Thematic Beta is calculated by applying a proprietary natural language algorithm using keyword terms to review large volumes of publicly available data, including datasets and documents... (2) Each company with a Thematic Beta score greater than zero is then mapped to one or more common equity securities, including ADRs, GDRs and EDRs, listed on exchanges in the Eligible Trading Venues (the Index Universe). If a corresponding security cannot be identified then the company is removed from consideration... (3) Liquidity and investability screens are then applied to each security in the Index Universe. Securities that do not meet the screen criteria are removed from the Index Universe... (4) The remaining securities in the Index Universe that have passed the applicable liquidity and investability screens are ranked by a function of their Thematic Beta and the weight of the security from the previous rebalancing (if applicable). Up to 50 companies are kept in the Index Universe. The securities are then reviewed by the index provider to ensure that they are positively exposed to the Theme based on one or more factors and business metrics applied by the index provider... One key thing to note is that STCE's index methodology differs from traditional market cap weighted index approaches, as a larger company is not necessarily guaranteed to make up a larger part of the fund. For example, STCE's second-largest holding IREN Ltd. (IREN) has a market cap of just $3.3 billion, while STCE's fourth-largest holding Coinbase (COIN) has a market cap of roughly $88 billion. The thematic beta approach is useful to ensure that larger companies which have some crypto exposure, but are mostly driven by exposure to other businesses, have a smaller weight in the index compared to companies that are more directly exposed to the crypto industry. However, the thematic approach also results in less concentrated exposure to the biggest companies with crypto exposure, such as MicroStrategy and Coinbase. Holdings Overview STCE is a fairly concentrated fund as it holds just 42 securities. The fund's top 5 holdings account for 42% of the fund's assets. One thing to note is that, due to the methodology discussed above, the largest market cap companies in the index such as MicroStrategy and Coinbase have exposures which are significantly lower than would be the case if the index was market cap weighted. On the other hand, much smaller companies such as Iren Ltd. and Cipher Mining have much larger exposure than would be the case if the index was market cap weighted. One interesting thing to note is that STCE has some exposure to companies with minimal exposure to the crypto theme. For example, the fund currently holds shares of PayPal (PYPL), Cboe Global Markets (CBOE), WisdomTree, StoneX Group (SNEX), Nvidia (NVDA), CME Group (CME), Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), and BGC Group (BGC). Together, these companies account for nearly 10% of STCE which is nearly as much as the fund's largest holding, MicroStrategy. While the companies mentioned here all have a small degree of exposure to crypto, I would argue that it is not a major driver of value for most of these companies, and thus these stocks are likely to move based on factors unrelated to crypto markets. STCE is primary focused on U.S. domiciled companies (76% of the portfolio) but also has exposure to Canadian domiciled companies (15.7% of the portfolio) and smaller exposures to companies from other countries. Charles Schwab Charles Schwab My Preferred Alternative to STCE My preferred way to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency theme is through Bitcoin ETFs. Specifically, I have owned the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF since its early days of trading and continue to hold it. I am very bullish near-term on Bitcoin itself, as I believe the conditions are in place such that a melt up is likely. Positive drivers for Bitcoin in the near-term include the recent halving event earlier this year, inflows for recently launched Bitcoin ETFs, increased institutional investor interest, a more friendly regulatory environment under a Trump administration, and the recent emergence of options on Bitcoin ETFs which have potential to drive a squeeze higher. I think the bull case was well covered by Seeking Alpha contributor Stony Chambers Asset Research in a recent piece, IBIT Options And Insatiable Corporate Demand: A Historical Squeeze Is Coming . Given my bullish view on Bitcoin, one might wonder why MicroStrategy is not my preferred alternative to STCE given that fact that it is a levered play on Bitcoin. The reason why I prefer to own Bitcoin ETFs is that MicroStrategy currently trades at a significant premium to its Bitcoin asset value. I expect the company to aggressively issue stock over the next few months to buy Bitcoin. My view is that this could result in relative underperformance of MicroStrategy as the stock moves down to trade closer to its Bitcoin asset value while Bitcoin itself continues to move higher. Conclusion STCE represents one way for investors to get exposure to companies which are exposed to the cryptocurrency industry. The fund charges a reasonable fee and has performed fairly well historically on a standalone basis. However, STCE has underperformed its peer funds since inception and has significantly underperformed Bitcoin itself. While STCE has exposure to companies that are heavily exposure to the cryptocurrency industry, it also has nearly 10% exposure to companies which are primarily driven by other factors. I view this as a negative, as STCE is not a true pure play vehicle. I am currently bullish on Bitcoin but prefer to express this view through Bitcoin ETFs as opposed to owning STCE.",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4742987-stce-not-my-preferred-crypto-play?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png

Last Thursday, Bitcoin made another major move after trading calmly for weeks. That positive action alone put the asset in a more bullish state as it painted a fresh all-time high of $104,088 on Binance. It lost grip and plunged to a low of $90,500 that same day, creating a notable spike. However, it recovered some ground and traded average at around the $100k level throughout the week. The price is currently down due to a 3% loss overnight. A continuous drop could result in more losses. The general market outlook appears strongly bullish from a long-term perspective but things are likely to slow down a bit as the daily volume indicator is now on the fall. Looking at the daily chart, BTC volatility has been contracting for almost a month, reaching an overbought condition. If Bitcoin advances bullishly, it may rally hard in the next few days. But from the look of things, it seems due for a correction. A drop below the $90k level could facilitate a small correction before rising back. As it stands, the white ascending trendline is still providing support for the market. A break below it could signal an end to the latest uptrend. BTC‚Äôs Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Aside from the mentioned ATH, there‚Äôs no key resistance level to stop the bulls in the next leg up. Once they push above it, a new high may surface at around $110,000 and potentially $115,000 Bitcoin‚Äôs key support right now is the $90,791 level. If the price breaks below it, the potential support for a retracement would be $85,072 and $81,500. Key Resistance Levels: $104,088, $110,000, $150,000 Key Support Levels: $90,791, $85,072, $81,500 Spot Price: $99,430 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Trump‚Äôs Tesla (TRUMTESLA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMTESLA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump‚Äôs Tesla can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump‚Äôs Tesla could become the next viral memecoin. Trump‚Äôs Tesla launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump‚Äôs Tesla on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump‚Äôs Tesla by entering its contract address ‚Äì 8T1qq1DxSqWqoR8J9hi3ULGCCoMJdqQBev4WAvJg9awR ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMTESLA.

BTC fell 2% from its six-figure landmark causing a dive across majors. XRP, dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana‚Äôs SOL fell as much as 5.5%, with BNB Chain‚Äôs BNB and ether (ETH) down 2.5%. Cardano‚Äôs ADA fared the worst with a 7% drop, which came on the back of the Cardano Foundation‚Äôs X account getting temporarily compromised on Sunday.

Responding to Gensler‚Äôs Approach Launched in 2023, Fairshake was created as a response to Gensler‚Äôs tough stance on cryptocurrency.

He criticized the lack of mention about a recent federal judge‚Äôs ruling that XRP is not a security. Instead, the show gave air time to Spencer, a former SEC official, who repeated the claim that XRP could still be considered a security.

This dramatic momentum shift caused uncertainty among many investors. This uncertainty extended to the altcoin market, as a massive decline for Bitcoin could adversely affect altcoins. Despite this recent turbulence, crypto analysts like Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) are confident that XRP has a bright future. He recently shared an intriguing insight into the asset‚Äôs potential trajectory, with lofty targets. #XRP is not dumping, it's a whole market thing. Triggered by #BTC dump. Fundamentals are very strong for XRP, if you're a holder, my gut is telling me it will hit $5 by Feb 2025. All this is noise. Not Financial Advice. I am not qualified to give any advice. pic.twitter.com/33dtboWwRl ‚Äî Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) December 5, 2024 Is XRP Going to $5? Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price performance exemplified the market‚Äôs unpredictability. However, BTC traded above $100,000 at the time of press, showing how quickly the market recovered. Interestingly, the altcoin market demonstrated remarkable resilience during this period. XRP, in particular, exhibited a more measured response to the market downturn. While Bitcoin experienced a significant drop, XRP‚Äôs value declined from $2.48 to $2.23, representing a more moderate 10% reduction. However, the digital asset recovered swiftly to trade at $2.53 but has since exhibited massive fluctuation. This performance has drawn the attention of market observers who typically expect altcoins to suffer more pronounced losses during cryptocurrency market corrections. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 According to Van Code, XRP‚Äôs fundamentals are strong, potentially contributing to its resilience. He implies that long-term investors should view current market fluctuations as temporary phenomena, calling the price decline ‚Äúnoise.‚Äù Van Code is convinced that XRP can reach $5 by February 2025 because the underlying strength of the digital asset remains intact. This target is almost twice the asset‚Äôs current price, and far above its all-time high of $3.84. Other analysts shared similar targets in the past, and XRP‚Äôs resilience and strong fundamentals suggest it could hit this target. Other Experts Weigh In Other prominent analysts like XRP Captain (@UniverseTwenty) have identified potential bullish indicators, including the formation of a bull flag pattern amid the recent downturn. This technical formation suggests the possibility of an imminent price breakout, and XRP Captain believes the digital asset can hit a new all-time high. King XRP (@MRKingXRP), another well-respected analyst, has highlighted a bullish triangle pattern and expects the asset to reach $54.24 in a few days. Experts are extremely bullish on XRP. One of them recently listed 8 reasons to hold the digital asset. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

37421059,https://crypto.news/?p=14317543,1733744482,Solana hits new highs as Lightchain AI aims to be the next big contender,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana‚Äôs blockchain dominance faces a challenge as Lightchain AI emerges with smart AI-powered solutions, redefining the future of decentralized technology. Table of Contents Solana‚Äôs ascent to new highs The challenges Solana faces Enter Lightchain AI: The rising contender Head-to-head: Solana vs. Lightchain AI What makes Lightchain AI stand out? What experts are saying Price forecast: Solana vs. Lightchain AI The road ahead: Who will lead? Bet on the future: Why Lightchain AI is your next smart move The cryptocurrency space thrives on innovation, competition, and groundbreaking technology. Solana (SOL), long hailed as a high-performance blockchain, continues to set benchmarks with its speed and affordability. Yet, as it reaches new highs, the question arises: Can Lightchain AI (LCAI) , the emerging blockchain-AI fusion, take the reins as the next transformative force in the market? While Solana enjoys its current momentum, Lightchain AI brings fresh perspectives, cutting-edge technology, and smart solutions to the blockchain ecosystem. This article explores how the two projects stack up and whether Lightchain AI has what it takes to rival Solana‚Äôs dominance. Solana‚Äôs ascent to new highs Solana‚Äôs journey has been nothing short of impressive, thanks to its efficient design and growing ecosystem. Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs been turning heads: 1. Blazing-fast transactions Solana can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) with super low fees. That‚Äôs a game-changer for developers and users who value speed and affordability. Its unique Proof of History (PoH) combined with Proof of Stake (PoS) ensures lightning-fast confirmations, making it perfect for scaling decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and NFT marketplaces. 2. A thriving ecosystem Solana‚Äôs ecosystem is growing fast, with all kinds of creative use cases. DeFi platforms: Think decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and yield farming protocols that operate smoother than ever. NFT marketplaces: Artists and creators love Solana for its low fees, making it a go-to for launching popular NFT collections. Web3 apps: Solana‚Äôs developer-friendly tools make it easy to build scalable decentralized applications (dApps). 3. Big backing With investment from major venture capital firms and support from institutions, Solana has built credibility with both crypto enthusiasts and mainstream users. This has also helped boost its price and market cap. The challenges Solana faces Of course, it‚Äôs not all smooth sailing for Solana . There are some roadblocks that could give competitors like Lightchain AI a chance to shine. Network reliability issues Solana has dealt with frequent outages during high-traffic periods, which hasn‚Äôt exactly helped its reputation. Developers and investors need a network they can count on, especially for important DeFi and web3 applications. Decentralization concerns Its validator network is relatively small, which raises questions about how decentralized it really is. For people who prioritize blockchain‚Äôs trustless nature, this can be a drawback. Stiff competition While Solana‚Äôs PoH technology was groundbreaking when it launched, newer projects like Lightchain AI are stepping in with features like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) that could steal the spotlight. Solana‚Äôs achievements are impressive, but it‚Äôll need to tackle these challenges if it wants to stay ahead in the ever-evolving blockchain world. You might also like: Ethereum and Solana loyalists are betting big on Lightchain AI for December 2024 Enter Lightchain AI: The rising contender Lightchain AI is an exciting blockchain platform that combines artificial intelligence with decentralized technology. By addressing some of Solana‚Äôs limitations and unlocking new possibilities, it‚Äôs paving the way for blockchain‚Äôs next big evolution. 1. Proof of Intelligence: A game-changing consensus mechanism Lightchain AI‚Äôs PoI takes a fresh approach to consensus. Instead of relying on traditional mining, it rewards nodes for performing AI tasks like model training and optimization. Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a big deal: It creates real-world value by advancing AI research and applications. It‚Äôs sustainable and energy-efficient‚Äîno more energy-draining mining. It‚Äôs scalable without compromising network security. 2. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine: A smart new layer The AIVM adds a unique layer that‚Äôs specifically designed for executing AI tasks on the blockchain. Developers can: Build dApps powered by real-time AI analytics. Use scalable AI solutions for industries like healthcare, supply chain, and finance. Create adaptive systems that get smarter over time. 3. Decentralized governance and transparency Lightchain AI believes in keeping things fair and community-driven. With decentralized governance, token holders have a say in shaping the project‚Äôs future, creating trust and inclusivity across the board. Head-to-head: Solana vs. Lightchain AI Feature Solana (SOL) Lightchain AI (LCAI) Consensus Mechanism Proof of History (PoH) Proof of Intelligence (PoI) Primary Applications DeFi, NFTs AI-enhanced dApps, finance, healthcare Transaction Speed High (65,000 TPS) Optimized for AI workloads Energy Efficiency Moderate Highly eco-friendly Decentralization Limited Fully decentralized governance Market Growth Potential Stable High-growth emerging project You might also like: Why Lightchain AI is stealing the spotlight from Ethereum and Solana What makes Lightchain AI stand out?

Logistics: Predictive analytics for seamless supply chain optimization. Finance: Advanced tools for managing risks and making smarter decisions. Sustainability matters Thanks to the PoI mechanism, Lightchain AI keeps its environmental impact to a minimum‚Äîsomething that‚Äôs becoming a must for eco-conscious developers and investors. A chance to get in early Right now, LCAI tokens are available at a presale price of $0.003‚Äîan incredible opportunity for early adopters. As the ecosystem grows, demand for these tokens is expected to rise significantly. Lightchain AI is more than just a blockchain; it‚Äôs a platform for sustainability and growth. What experts are saying Solana‚Äôs position Blockchain analysts acknowledge Solana‚Äôs strong foundation and widespread adoption. However, they highlight its inability to address emerging demands, particularly in AI-driven applications. Experts warn that reliance on its existing architecture may limit its long-term growth. Lightchain AI‚Äôs potential Lightchain AI is viewed as a forward-looking project that combines blockchain and AI to solve real-world problems. Analysts praise its ability to attract developers from diverse sectors, creating a versatile ecosystem that appeals to both enterprises and individual users. Price forecast: Solana vs. Lightchain AI Cryptocurrency Short-Term (2024) Long-Term (2026 and Beyond) Solana $300-$400 $500+ (dependent on staying competitive) Lightchain AI $1-$5 $50+ (driven by industry adoption and innovation) The road ahead: Who will lead? Solana might have the perks of an established ecosystem, but with its reliability hiccups and centralization issues, there‚Äôs plenty of room for fresh ideas. Enter Lightchain AI, the cool new kid on the blockchain block. By blending AI and blockchain, it tackles scalability, sustainability, and real-world utility like a pro. Lightchain AI isn‚Äôt here to compete with Solana‚Äîit‚Äôs here to show what blockchains should be doing.

37421031,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373952,1733744386,Top Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions,"TL;DR Despite plunging in the past 24 hours, XRP has surged significantly in the last 30 days, with analysts predicting additional gains. Leadership changes at the SEC could influence the outcome of Ripple‚Äôs legal battle and XRP‚Äôs price trajectory. The Calm Before the Storm? Ripple‚Äôs XRP experienced an impressive bull run over the past month, with its price skyrocketing by 330%. On December 3, it tapped a nearly six-year peak of $2.82. Currently, it trades at approximately $2.38, which represents a 6% decline on a daily scale . XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko According to some popular analysts, XRP might be poised for much more substantial gains in the near future . The X user Ali Martinez suggested that the asset ‚Äúlooks undervalued after breaking out of this massive multi-year symmetrical triangle.‚Äù He set a ‚Äúconservative target‚Äù of $8.40 and an ‚Äúoptimistic‚Äù one of a whopping $48.12. Veteran trader Peter Brandt chipped in, too . He maintained that XRP has ‚Äúthe most powerful chart in all of crypto world.‚Äù It is worth mentioning that Brandt has been quite critical of Ripple‚Äôs native token over the years, expressing skepticism about its value and potential numerous times. The X user CRYPTOWZRD shared a similar thesis, predicting that XRP‚Äôs market cap is on its way to hitting a new all-time high of $270 billion. XRP‚ÄôS BEAUTY The most beautiful chart in the whole space .. Dear bears, I‚Äôm sorry.. you had several years‚Ä¶ $XRP is going so much higher.. up next is $270B.. it won‚Äôt stop there See you at a new all time high‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/DpIAPV7Ohh ‚Äî CRYPTOWZRD (@cryptoWZRD_) December 8, 2024 As of writing these lines, its capitalization stands at around $136 billion. This makes XRP the fourth-biggest cryptocurrency, trailing behind Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (USDT). The Ripple v. SEC Lawsuit Remains a Burden One factor that may propel a further pump for XRP‚Äôs price is a favorable resolution of the four-year-long legal battle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Not long ago, Gary Gensler (the current Chairman of the agency ) confirmed he will vacate his post in January next year. His departure was somewhat expected since the recently elected president of the United States, Donald Trump, promised to fire him on day 1 after assuming office. Gensler is known as a critic of the digital asset industry with the Commission filing multiple lawsuits against crypto businesses during his tenure. Last week, Trump nominated former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins to spearhead the securities regulator. The latter has been a consistent advocate of the crypto sector, and it will be interesting to see whether the Ripple case will reach a faster conclusion under his leadership.

Every breakthrough, every new development, offers a glimpse into the future of decentralized technology. So, which ERC-20 tokens are making the most noise this month? Santiment‚Äôs latest analysis ranks the top performers by development activity. Curious to know who‚Äôs leading the charge and why their developments matter? Let‚Äôs dive in and uncover the trends. Here are crypto's top ERC-20 coins by development activity. Directional indicators represent each project's ranking positioning since last month: 1) @chainlink $LINK 2) #susd $SUSD 3) @synthetix_io $SNX 4) @ethereum $ETH 5) @ethstatus $SNT 6)‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/dHiUwVwvyF ‚Äî Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 9, 2024 Chainlink ($LINK): Still the Dev Leader! Chainlink ($LINK) remains at the top of the development activity rankings, and December is no exception. With 649 GitHub events in just one month, Chainlink continues to lead the way‚Äîsurpassing even Ethereum in activity. Why is this important? Chainlink projects like the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) are transforming how real-world assets are tokenized. They are also advancing zkEVM chains, allowing decentralized apps to use secure, advanced data feeds. The numbers back their progress too.

The surge has propelled year-to-date (YTD) inflows to $41 billion, with total assets under management (AuM) climbing to an all-time high of $165 billion, according to a report from CoinShares . By comparison, the 2021 bull cycle saw inflows of $10.6 billion and an AuM peak of $83 billion. U.S. Leads in Terms of Inflows Regionally, inflows were led by the United States, which accounted for $3.6 billion of the total. Other significant contributions came from Switzerland ($160 million), Germany ($116 million), Canada ($14 million), and Australia ($10 million). Bitcoin investment products dominated the inflows, attracting $2.5 billion and bringing its YTD total to $36.5 billion. Meanwhile, products that allow investors to short Bitcoin saw modest inflows of $6.2 million, a figure lower than historical norms following sharp price rises. This suggests caution among investors against the cryptocurrency‚Äôs recent upward momentum. Ethereum also broke records, registering its highest-ever weekly inflow of $1.2 billion. The surge overshadowed Ethereum‚Äôs July ETF launch and came at the expense of Solana, which experienced $14 million in outflows for the second consecutive week. Digital asset investment products saw the largest weekly inflows on record last week totalling US$3.85bn!

The inflow surge surpassed the previous record of $333 million set on November 29, highlighting growing investor confidence in Ether ETFs. Blockchain equities saw inflows of $124 million, marking the largest weekly increase since January. The surge reflects growing investor optimism fueled by improved profit margins for Bitcoin miners. $10 Billion Flowed into Spot Bitcoin ETFs Since Trump Win In the broader market, nearly $10 billion has flowed into U.S. exchange-traded funds (ETFs) directly investing in Bitcoin since the re-election of President Donald Trump on November 5. The influx has lifted ETF assets to approximately $113 billion, underscoring investor confidence in the administration‚Äôs pro-crypto stance. President Trump has pledged to replace the Biden administration‚Äôs skepticism toward digital assets with supportive regulations, including the concept of a strategic national Bitcoin reserve. His administration‚Äôs appointments of crypto advocates to key regulatory and policy roles, such as the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, have further fueled market optimism. Bitcoin prices reflect this sentiment, surpassing $100,000 for the first time on December 5. Although the token briefly dipped to $92,000 due to volatility, it remains on a six-week streak of gains, its longest since 2021‚Äôs crypto boom. While Bitcoin‚Äôs historic surge past the $100,000 milestone has captivated the cryptocurrency market, Sergei Gorev, Head of Risk at YouHodler, remains cautious. In a recent statement shared with Cryptonews.com, Gorev predicted that the price may see only moderate growth beyond this level before a significant correction takes hold. ‚ÄúThe cryptocurrency market is very fond of round numbers, and the price often unfolds in such cases.‚Äù The post Digital Asset Investment Products Hit Record-Breaking $3.85B Weekly Inflows appeared first on Cryptonews .",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/digital-asset-investment-products-hit-record-breaking-3-85-billion-weekly-inflows/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37422721.jpeg
37420849,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373942,1733743991,Amazon Shareholders Urge Bitcoin Adoption as Treasury Asset to Protect Value,"Amazon shareholders have called on the tech giant to consider Bitcoin as a treasury asset, arguing that this could protect shareholder value while aligning with emerging financial trends. The resolution requests Amazon‚Äôs board to assess the long-term benefits of incorporating Bitcoin into its treasury strategy. Bitcoin‚Äôs Appeal Grows Amazon shareholders, guided by the conservative think tank National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), have proposed an important strategy urging the tech giant to allocate part of its $88 billion in cash reserves to Bitcoin. This proposal is driven by the growing recognition of Bitcoin‚Äôs potential as a hedge against inflation, a concern highlighted by the NCPPR‚Äôs assertion that traditional metrics like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) may understate actual inflation rates, which it estimates closer to 10%. Emphasizing Bitcoin‚Äôs historical performance, the NCPPR argued that despite its volatility, the asset has consistently outpaced traditional financial instruments such as corporate bonds. The proposal pointed out several prominent examples of corporate Bitcoin adoption, like MicroStrategy, which holds over 402,000 BTC valued at $40 billion, and Tesla, further substantiating this claim. Analysts speculate that if Amazon embraces Bitcoin, it could catalyze a broader corporate shift, potentially influencing giants like Apple. Industry voices, including Binance‚Äôs Changpeng Zhao, have amplified this push, advocating Bitcoin payments as the next logical step for Amazon. Microsoft Faces Push for Bitcoin Diversification The proposal comes a little over a month after the think tank announced plans to propose a Bitcoin Diversification Assessment at Microsoft‚Äôs annual shareholder meeting on December 10. The proposal, detailed in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), advocated for Microsoft to consider Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and macroeconomic pressures. It suggests allocating at least 1% of the company‚Äôs total assets to the cryptocurrency. Microsoft‚Äôs board, on the other hand, opposed the idea and requested the shareholders to vote against it. The board argues that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have already been assessed in the company‚Äôs financial strategies and continue to be monitored for potential opportunities. Earlier this month, Michael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy, recently urged Microsoft‚Äôs board of directors with a proposal urging the company to adopt Bitcoin on a larger scale.

Although the market continues to expect BTC to reach higher levels by rising above $100,000, one analyst said that data shows that BTC is unlikely to continue to reach new highs until January. Speaking to Decrypt, Sean Dawson, head of research at DeFi derivatives protocol Derive, said that the probability of BTC reaching $150,000 by January 2025 is low and that the probability of Bitcoin exceeding $150,000 is 6%. Stating that the derivatives market has a small chance for Bitcoin's upward momentum to increase further, the analyst stated that Ethereum also has a 10.5% probability of reaching $6,000. ‚ÄúWe see a 10.5% probability of Ethereum reaching $6,000 by January 31, while Bitcoin has a 6% probability of exceeding $150,000.

The move excited the DOGE community, as the meme coin seemed ready for further gains. However, the price has since retraced slightly, failing to confirm a breakout above this critical resistance. Top analyst and trader Cheds shared his insights on X, revealing that Dogecoin is pressing against its range highs. According to his technical analysis, a confirmed breakout above these levels could set the stage for a significant rally, potentially driving DOGE toward new all-time highs. Related Reading: Large Ethereum Transactions Grow As ETH Breaks Yearly Highs While the recent price action has sparked optimism, the market remains cautious, with bulls needing to sustain momentum for any meaningful upside. Cheds highlights the importance of breaking above these critical resistance levels, emphasizing that a successful move could pave the way for DOGE to reclaim its bullish narrative. With Dogecoin at a crucial juncture, the next few days will determine whether the price continues to climb or settles into further consolidation. All eyes are now on the $0.484 mark as traders await confirmation of a breakout or signs of renewed selling pressure. Dogecoin Testing Key Levels Dogecoin is currently testing key liquidity levels around $0.44 and below the critical $0.50 mark, sparking intense interest among traders. These levels have acted as both support and resistance, making them crucial for determining DOGE‚Äôs next significant move. Analysts believe a clear path to new highs will emerge if Dogecoin can break above these thresholds. Top analyst and trader Cheds shared a detailed technical analysis on X, highlighting Dogecoin‚Äôs ongoing battle with its range highs since November 24. Despite multiple attempts, DOGE has struggled to confirm a decisive breakout, which would signal the beginning of a new rally. According to Cheds, once the meme coin clears these key levels, a massive surge is likely to follow, potentially propelling the price to challenge its all-time highs for the first time since 2021. This outlook aligns with Dogecoin‚Äôs recent price dynamics, which show resilience despite broader market volatility. The upcoming days are critical as traders await whether DOGE can solidify its breakout and sustain upward momentum. Related Reading: XRP Price Forecast ‚Äì Analyst Sets $4 Target After Potential Retrace Breaking above $0.50 and holding that level for several days will catalyze Dogecoin‚Äôs rally. If bulls succeed, the market could witness another parabolic move, reviving the excitement that has historically driven DOGE to unprecedented highs. Last Level Of Supply Before A Rally Dogecoin is trading at $0.43 after weeks of sideways consolidation and repeated failed breakouts, leaving investors increasingly frustrated with its stagnant price action. Despite attempts to gain upward momentum, DOGE has struggled to surpass key resistance levels, and the lack of a decisive breakout is testing the patience of market participants. Currently, all eyes are on the $0.44 level, a critical threshold for Dogecoin‚Äôs price trajectory. If DOGE manages to hold above this level in the coming days, a breakout could finally materialize, potentially leading to a surge toward higher resistance zones and reigniting investor enthusiasm. However, the downside risk remains significant. Should Dogecoin fail to maintain its current levels, it could face a deeper retracement, testing lower demand zones as investors reassess their positions. This would likely dampen sentiment further, leaving the meme coin vulnerable to continued consolidation or even bearish pressure.

Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a hedge against inflation As of Sept. 30, 2024, the total U.S. federal debt is $35.5 trillion, a $2.3 trillion increase from 2023, as per the recent Financial Audit data. Institutions and nations seeking decentralized alternatives like BTC are encouraged by the rising levels of fiscal instability that undermine trust in traditional fiat systems. Due to its capped supply and freedom from central banks, BTC is increasingly viewed as a hedge against inflation and monetary uncertainty.

The crypto world and its endless potential have revealed many alternative investment opportunities with potentially much higher yields than traditional options. Husky Inu (HINU) , a promising Solana-based memecoin, Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are prime buying opportunities for the savvy crypto investor. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Enjoys Massive Gains Shiba Inu (SHIB) gained an impressive 56% in the past month as developers successfully rolled out enhanced security upgrades to Shiba Inu‚Äôs Shibarium bridge. Shibarium is Shiba Inu‚Äôs Layer-2 blockchain, which enables seamless and secure token transfers between Ethereum and Shibarium. The bridge will also undergo a hard fork next week to optimize network performance, improve transaction speeds and address scalability concerns. SHIB, the native token of Shiba Inu, is one of the top-selling memecoins by market cap.¬†The decentralized community-led token and its reputation as the ‚ÄúDogecoin Killer‚Äù has yielded impressive rewards in the past year, gaining over 191%.¬†SHIB is one of the biggest Solana-based memecoins, which¬†quickly rose to fame in the crypto industry and has since become a household name. SHIB, launched in 2020, is currently the 12th largest crypto by market cap and the second biggest memecoin after Dogecoin (DOGE). SHIB surged in popularity thanks to its dedicated community of investors, its charm, and the support of industry giants such as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Pepe (PEPE) Sets a New All-Time High Pepe¬†(PEPE) is a fan favourite among crypto investors, gaining a whopping 1,400%¬†in the past year. The project is currently the third largest memecoin by market cap and quickly gained infamy for being a tribute to the 2000s internet meme sensation Pepe the Frog. Pepe has continued a reward streak driven by its robust community, rapid ascent and highly optimistic future projections. Analysts predict the memecoin will potentially increase by over 2100% by 2030, positioning it as a prime opportunity for those interested in meme coins' speculative aspects. Pepe has also handsomely gained since the Trump victory, gaining over 127% in the past month. PEPE‚Äôs popularity and value surged after exchanges Robinhood and Coinbase listed the memecoin for trading, skyrocketing the memecoin to a new ATH of $0.00002748 on December 9, 2024. Dogecoin (DOGE): The OG Memecoin Dogecoin (DOGE), the top memecoin by market cap, exploded after Donald Trump‚Äôs victory over Kamala Harris in the US presidential election. DOGE ranks as the 7th¬†largest crypto with a market cap exceeding $63.9 billion, and further gains are expected in the coming months. DOGE quickly rose through the ranks to become a household name in the crypto industry, owing its success to a strong community spurred by the involvement and endorsement of Elon Musk. The tech mogul is the world‚Äôs richest man, CEO of Tesla, and owner of social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Musk joined the Trump campaign, playing an integral role in the president-elect‚Äôs victory, and his involvement with the party could see DOGE run to new heights as the Trump administration comes into power. DOGE‚Äôs value stepped into overdrive after Donald Trump released a statement naming Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy as the leads of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. According to Trump, DOGE will pave the way for his administration to ‚Äúdismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditure, and restructure Federal Agencies ‚Äì Essential to the ‚ÄúSave America‚Äù Movement.‚Äù Husky Inu (HINU) Presale Generates Over $600K! Husky Inu (HINU) is one of the newest members of the Solana network, created to bring its holders more value and utility by harnessing the power of this popular blockchain. Husky Inu recently launched the presale of its native token, HINU , with tremendous success, and the two are on a mission to conquer the memecoin industry through a robust and supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Since going live, the presale has generated over $612,000, completing its third presale round. Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders.

37420501,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108357,1733742933,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Falls to 78, Remaining in ‚ÄòExtreme Greed‚Äô Zone","In the dynamic and often volatile world of cryptocurrency, market sentiment plays a crucial role in shaping price movements and investment strategies. One of the most widely referenced tools for gauging this sentiment is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . As of December 9, 2024, the index has fallen to 78 , maintaining its position in the ‚ÄòExtreme Greed‚Äô zone. This persistent level of extreme greed signals a market that remains highly bullish, albeit with underlying concerns about potential overheating and subsequent corrections. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a metric designed to evaluate the prevailing sentiment within the cryptocurrency market. Developed by the software development platform Alternative , the index aggregates data from various indicators to provide a comprehensive snapshot of market emotions. Ranging from 0 to 100, the index categorizes sentiment into five distinct zones: Extreme Fear (0-24): Indicates significant pessimism, often preceding market bottoms. Fear (25-49): Reflects apprehension and uncertainty among investors. Neutral (50-74): Suggests a balanced market sentiment. Greed (75-99): Denotes strong optimism and potential market exuberance. Extreme Greed (100): Signifies overwhelming bullishness, often leading to market tops. The Current Reading: 78 in the Extreme Greed Zone With the index currently at 78 , the market remains firmly in the ‚ÄòExtreme Greed‚Äô zone. This level indicates that the majority of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, as tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), have been outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) over the past 90 days. While a high index value reflects robust investor confidence and a bullish market outlook, it also raises concerns about potential market overheating and the sustainability of current price levels. Components of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The index is calculated based on six different factors, each contributing to the overall sentiment score: Volatility (25%) Market Momentum/Volume (25%) Social Media (15%) Surveys (15%) Bitcoin Dominance (10%) Google Trends (10%) 1. Volatility (25%) Volatility measures the degree of variation in Bitcoin‚Äôs price over a specific period. High volatility often correlates with fear, as significant price swings can signal instability and risk. Conversely, lower volatility tends to reflect a more stable and confident market sentiment. In the current context, a relatively stable volatility level contributes to maintaining a high index score, as extreme price fluctuations are less pronounced. 2. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) Market Momentum and Volume assess the trading activity and the speed at which prices are changing. High trading volumes paired with upward price momentum typically indicate strong buying interest, pushing the index higher. The current high momentum suggests that investors are actively purchasing cryptocurrencies, further fueling the extreme greed sentiment. 3. Social Media (15%) Social Media sentiment analyzes the tone and volume of discussions surrounding cryptocurrencies across platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook. Positive sentiments and increased mentions can drive enthusiasm and fear of missing out (FOMO), contributing to higher index scores. Currently, social media sentiment remains overwhelmingly positive, reinforcing the extreme greed zone. 4. Surveys (15%) Surveys gather direct feedback from investors regarding their sentiment and outlook on the market. When a majority of respondents express bullish sentiments and confidence in future price increases, the index reflects this optimism. Presently, survey results indicate strong positive sentiment, supporting the high index value. 5. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) Bitcoin Dominance measures Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization relative to the total cryptocurrency market cap. A decreasing Bitcoin dominance often signifies a rising interest in altcoins, contributing to higher greed levels as investors seek higher returns in alternative assets. The current dominance trends suggest a balanced yet slightly favoring Bitcoin‚Äôs stable role in the market. 6. Google Trends (10%) Google Trends analyze the search interest in cryptocurrencies over time. Increased search volumes for terms like ‚ÄúBitcoin,‚Äù ‚ÄúEthereum,‚Äù or ‚Äúcrypto investment‚Äù indicate growing public interest and can drive market excitement. The index benefits from high search activity, reflecting heightened curiosity and engagement with the crypto market. Implications of Remaining in the Extreme Greed Zone Market Sentiment and Investor Behavior The ‚ÄòExtreme Greed‚Äô classification indicates that investors are highly optimistic, often leading to increased buying activity and upward price momentum. This bullish sentiment can drive prices to new highs as more participants enter the market, fueled by the fear of missing out (FOMO) on potential gains. However, sustained extreme greed can also signal overvaluation. When sentiment becomes excessively bullish, it can lead to speculative bubbles, where prices rise beyond their intrinsic value. This environment increases the risk of a significant correction or crash, as market participants may eventually lose confidence, triggering a sell-off. Potential for Market Corrections Historically, periods of extreme greed have often been followed by market corrections. For instance, the 2017 Bitcoin bull run saw the index reach extreme levels, only to be followed by a sharp decline in 2018. While past performance is not indicative of future results, the current high index value suggests that investors should be cautious and prepared for possible downturns. Impact on Altcoins and Bitcoin A high Crypto Fear & Greed Index not only affects Bitcoin but also has broader implications for the entire cryptocurrency market. Altcoins, which often exhibit higher volatility than Bitcoin, can experience more significant price swings. During periods of extreme greed, altcoins may see disproportionate gains as investors seek higher returns, potentially inflating their valuations beyond sustainable levels. Conversely, if the market sentiment shifts and extreme greed subsides, altcoins may be among the first to experience corrections. Investors might revert to more stable assets, including Bitcoin, reducing the relative dominance of altcoins and leading to a market-wide adjustment. Historical Context: Extreme Greed and Market Cycles Past Instances of Extreme Greed The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has recorded extreme greed several times in the past, each corresponding with major bull runs and subsequent corrections: December 2017: The index reached extreme greed levels as Bitcoin‚Äôs price surged to nearly $20,000. This period was marked by massive media coverage, widespread retail investor participation, and speculative trading, culminating in a significant market correction in 2018. May 2021: Following Bitcoin‚Äôs peak of around $64,000, the index again entered the extreme greed zone. This period saw heightened institutional investment and mainstream adoption but was followed by a notable downturn due to regulatory concerns and market saturation. November 2023: The index hit extreme greed amid a booming crypto market driven by technological advancements and increased integration with traditional financial systems. While the market remained bullish for a while, the index eventually stabilized as investors began to reassess valuations. Lessons from the Past Analyzing historical instances of extreme greed offers valuable insights: Sustainability: Markets cannot sustain extreme greed indefinitely. Periods of excessive optimism are often followed by corrections as investor sentiment shifts. Investor Preparedness: Understanding market cycles helps investors prepare for volatility. Diversification and risk management become crucial during high sentiment phases. Regulatory Influence: Regulatory actions can significantly impact market sentiment. Clear and supportive regulations can sustain growth, while stringent measures can trigger corrections. Expert Opinions: Navigating Extreme Greed Analyst Perspectives Financial analysts and cryptocurrency experts offer diverse views on the implications of an extreme greed index: Optimistic Views: Some analysts argue that extreme greed reflects strong market fundamentals and increased adoption. They believe that high sentiment can drive continued growth and innovation within the crypto ecosystem. Cautious Optimism: Others adopt a more balanced stance, recognizing the current bullish sentiment but emphasizing the need for caution. They suggest that while the market may continue to rise, investors should be mindful of the potential for corrections and avoid overexposure. Bearish Predictions: A faction of skeptics warns that extreme greed is a red flag for impending market downturns. They advocate for profit-taking, diversification, and maintaining a long-term investment perspective to mitigate risks. Investment Strategies During Extreme Greed Given the high Crypto Fear & Greed Index, investors might consider the following strategies: Profit-Taking: Locking in gains by selling portions of profitable holdings can protect against potential downturns. Diversification: Spreading investments across various assets, including stablecoins, stocks, and traditional financial instruments, reduces risk exposure. Risk Management: Implementing stop-loss orders and position sizing can help manage potential losses during volatile periods. Long-Term Holding: Adopting a buy-and-hold strategy can help investors weather short-term volatility, focusing on the long-term potential of their investments. The Broader Market Context: Current Trends and Developments Technological Innovations Advancements in blockchain technology continue to drive interest and investment in the crypto market. Innovations such as layer-two scaling solutions , decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms , and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) contribute to the expanding utility and adoption of cryptocurrencies. These developments enhance the functionality and appeal of digital assets, supporting the high sentiment reflected in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. Regulatory Landscape The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies remains a critical factor influencing market sentiment. Positive regulatory developments, such as the approval of Bitcoin ETFs and supportive policies in major economies, can bolster investor confidence and sustain bullish trends. Conversely, regulatory crackdowns and unfavorable policies can dampen sentiment and trigger sell-offs. Institutional Adoption Institutional interest in cryptocurrencies has grown significantly, with major financial institutions, hedge funds, and publicly traded companies incorporating digital assets into their portfolios. This institutional adoption adds legitimacy to the market, driving increased investment and supporting high sentiment levels. The involvement of institutional players can also enhance liquidity and market stability, mitigating some of the risks associated with extreme greed. Macroeconomic Factors Global economic conditions, including inflation rates, interest rate policies, and geopolitical tensions, continue to impact the cryptocurrency market. High inflation rates, for instance, can drive investors towards cryptocurrencies as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation. Similarly, economic uncertainties and political instability can increase demand for decentralized assets, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Potential Risks and Considerations Market Volatility While a high Crypto Fear & Greed Index reflects strong investor confidence, it also underscores the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Significant price fluctuations can result in substantial gains but also expose investors to considerable losses. Managing this volatility through strategic investment approaches is essential to safeguard portfolios. Regulatory Uncertainty The evolving regulatory landscape poses ongoing challenges for the cryptocurrency market. Changes in regulations can impact the legality, trading mechanisms, and overall acceptance of cryptocurrencies, influencing market sentiment and investor behavior. Staying informed about regulatory developments and adapting investment strategies accordingly is crucial for navigating this uncertainty. Overvaluation Concerns Extreme greed can lead to overvaluation, where asset prices exceed their intrinsic value. This overvaluation increases the risk of a market correction, as investors may reassess valuations and shift towards more stable assets. Monitoring valuation metrics and maintaining a disciplined investment approach can help mitigate the risks associated with overvaluation. Psychological Factors Investor psychology plays a significant role in market dynamics. During periods of extreme greed, emotions like FOMO and euphoria can drive irrational investment decisions, leading to herd behavior and speculative bubbles. Maintaining emotional discipline and adhering to a well-defined investment strategy can help investors avoid the pitfalls of emotionally driven decisions. Future Outlook: Navigating the Crypto Market Sustaining Growth Amid Extreme Greed While the current extreme greed sentiment suggests robust market growth, sustaining this momentum requires continuous innovation, regulatory support, and the maturation of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Projects that offer tangible use cases, demonstrate technological advancements, and foster strong community engagement are more likely to sustain growth and attract long-term investment. Preparing for Potential Corrections Investors should remain vigilant and prepared for potential market corrections. Implementing risk management strategies, diversifying portfolios, and maintaining a balanced investment approach can help mitigate the impact of sudden downturns. Recognizing the cyclical nature of market sentiment and positioning portfolios to capitalize on both bullish and bearish phases is essential for long-term success. The Role of Emerging Technologies Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), are likely to shape the future of the cryptocurrency market. These technologies can enhance the functionality, security, and interoperability of digital assets, driving further adoption and investment. Keeping abreast of technological trends and integrating relevant innovations can provide a competitive edge in the evolving market landscape. Institutional Influence and Market Maturity As institutional involvement in the cryptocurrency market deepens, the market is likely to mature, exhibiting increased stability and reduced volatility. Institutional players bring disciplined investment approaches, risk management practices, and significant capital inflows, contributing to a more robust and resilient market infrastructure. This maturation can support sustained growth and mitigate some of the risks associated with extreme greed. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a valuable barometer for understanding market sentiment and guiding investment strategies within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As of December 9, 2024, the index‚Äôs value of 78 underscores a market entrenched in ‚ÄòExtreme Greed‚Äô , reflecting strong investor confidence and bullish sentiment. While this high sentiment can drive continued market growth and innovation, it also heightens the risk of overvaluation and potential market corrections. Investors navigating this environment should adopt a strategic approach, emphasizing diversification, risk management, and emotional discipline to capitalize on the opportunities presented by extreme greed while safeguarding against its inherent risks. Staying informed about technological advancements, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic factors will further enhance the ability to make informed and resilient investment decisions. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, the interplay between investor sentiment, technological innovation, and regulatory frameworks will shape its trajectory. By leveraging tools like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and maintaining a balanced and informed investment strategy, participants can effectively navigate the complexities of the market, harnessing its potential for growth while mitigating the challenges posed by volatility and sentiment-driven dynamics.

The scammer persuaded the artist to mint his work on a counterfeit NFT marketplace designed to mimic the reputable OpenSea platform.

MicroStrategy CEO Weighs In appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the possibility of a pro-crypto candidate winning the US presidency becomes more likely, former MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor has been vocal about creating a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve for the country. Recently, President-elect Donald Trump hinted at his plan to set up this reserve , sparking both interest and controversy. But the big question is: Will he be able to make it happen? Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the challenges ahead. Saylor‚Äôs Vision for a Bitcoin Reserve In a recent interview , Saylor expressed his excitement over Trump‚Äôs win, especially for the crypto industry. He called for a new framework under the next administration that is low on regulation and encourages innovation. This would help grow the digital economy, with the Bitcoin reserve being a key part of the plan. Saylor‚Äôs idea? The US should buy a significant amount of Bitcoin to strengthen its financial power worldwide. Why Are People Opposing the Idea? While Saylor is pushing for the Bitcoin reserve, many lawmakers are not convinced . Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has been one of the most vocal critics, questioning both the legitimacy and purpose of the plan. She has raised concerns about how to convince Americans of the benefits this reserve could bring to the economy. In her view, it won‚Äôt be easy for Trump to push this initiative through. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Displaying a Bearish Divergence Is This a Matter of Concern for the BTC Price Rally? , Saylor Makes a Strong Argument In response to the criticism, Saylor defended the plan by positioning it as a necessary step to keep the US financially strong in the face of rising competition from Russia and China. He suggested that the US buy 20-25% of the total Bitcoin supply, arguing that selling off some of its gold reserves to fund this purchase would weaken competitors who depend on gold. According to Saylor, this could increase the value of the US capital reserve by trillions of dollars. Interestingly, institutional interest in Bitcoin is growing. Former Bank of America executive Steve Weiss recently revealed that the bank is aggressively buying Bitcoin. This growing confidence from large institutions only adds weight to Saylor‚Äôs argument for a Bitcoin reserve. The Future of Bitcoin in the US Economy The debate over Bitcoin‚Äôs role in the US economy is heating up.

With key figures like Robert Kennedy Jr., Howard Lutnick, and Tulsi Gabbard set to influence policy and a light-touch SEC green-lighting compliant crypto enterprises, the environment for blockchain businesses is becoming increasingly favorable. This renewed support for digital assets and blockchain technology realigns America with longstanding tradition of technological innovation. While these tailwinds don‚Äôt alter the technical footprint of existing US-based blockchains, they certainly make it easier for them to do business: onboarding institutions; integrating web3 protocols; partnering with companies intent on leveraging their stack. The following blockchains have already done the hard work of building out their respective ecosystems. Now that the US is open for crypto business, they‚Äôre poised to flourish. Constellation Network: Data Security Meets Decentralization Constellation Network stands out for its focus on data assurance and interoperability. Founded in 2017, it‚Äôs developed Hypergraph Transfer Protocol (HGTP), a framework that reimagines how blockchains securely process and validate data. Designed to address big data challenges, HGTP facilitates seamless communication between blockchains, making it as integral to web3 as HTTP is to the world wide web. What sets Constellation apart is its adoption by mission-critical industries. Its zero-trust architecture and edge validation capabilities make it a natural fit for military and supply chain applications. Validated by the U.S. Department of Defense and the Air Force Research Laboratory , Constellation‚Äôs solutions are already embedded in cutting-edge environments like Panasonic Toughbooks, ensuring real-time insights and secure workflows in ruggedized operations. Moreover, its partnership with Common Crawl to integrate blockchain and AI highlights its vision for the future of decentralized data. As Constellation opens its metagraph application layer to developers, it‚Äôs positioning itself as a hub for real innovation. The ability to integrate seamlessly with existing hardware and workflows makes it a frontrunner in applications requiring scalable, secure, and cost-effective solutions. Hashgraph: Blockchain with Enterprise-Grade Efficiency Hedera Hashgraph has carved a niche as a highly efficient enterprise-ready blockchain. Its unique hashgraph consensus algorithm provides high throughput and security without compromising on energy efficiency. Hedera‚Äôs governing council, which includes corporate heavyweights like Google, IBM, and Boeing, ensures its decentralized infrastructure remains resilient and enterprise-focused. HBAR‚Äôs utility extends beyond its governance model. Its energy-efficient approach to achieving consensus is increasingly relevant as environmental concerns take center stage in blockchain discussions. Hedera has also embraced tokenization and decentralized identity solutions, making it a key player in sectors like supply chain management, healthcare, and IoT. The network‚Äôs ability to handle up to 10,000 transactions per second gives it an edge in scalability. As more organizations seek blockchain solutions that can integrate with existing systems without overhauling infrastructure, Hedera Hashgraph is a strong contender. Ripple: Bridging Global Payments Through Blockchain Ripple has long been synonymous with blockchain-based cross-border payments. Its native token, XRP , facilitates near-instant settlement at minimal cost, solving inefficiencies in traditional banking systems. Ripple‚Äôs partnerships with major financial institutions have solidified its reputation as a blockchain tailored for real-world financial use cases. Despite regulatory hurdles in recent years, Ripple has emerged stronger, with the resolution of its SEC lawsuit positioning it for renewed growth. Its RippleNet technology continues to gain traction globally, offering liquidity and settlement solutions that reduce the friction of international transactions. Ripple‚Äôs focus on interoperability is also noteworthy. By integrating with Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) initiatives, Ripple aims to modernize global payments while maintaining compliance with evolving financial regulations. Algorand: Balancing Performance and Sustainability Algorand is a blockchain designed for high performance, offering near-instant finality and low transaction costs. Its Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism ensures security while minimizing energy usage, making it one of the greenest blockchains on the market. With an ecosystem rich in decentralized finance projects and NFTs, Algorand has attracted retail users attracted by its speed and ease of use. Its recent focus on institutional adoption, meanwhile, has positioned Algorand as a go-to blockchain for enterprises exploring tokenized assets and blockchain-based governance. Algorand‚Äôs support for seamless smart contract deployment and its collaboration with global organizations like the International Blockchain Monetary Reserve (IBMR) highlight its role as a versatile, sustainable blockchain platform. Cardano: Advancing Blockchain with a Research-First Approach Cardano has earned its reputation as a research-driven blockchain. Famously founded by Charles Hoskinson, one of Ethereum‚Äôs co-creators, Cardano employs a layered architecture that separates computation from settlement, enhancing security and scalability. The platform‚Äôs Ouroboros consensus algorithm, rooted in academic rigor, makes it one of the most secure proof-of-stake blockchains available. Cardano‚Äôs focus on decentralized governance is exemplified by its Project Catalyst initiative, which funds community-driven projects to foster ecosystem growth. Cardano is also a strong advocate for blockchain adoption in underserved regions, particularly in Africa, where it‚Äôs partnering with governments and institutions to build blockchain-based solutions for identity and financial inclusion. Stellar: Democratizing Global Financial Access Stellar is a blockchain designed to facilitate low-cost, cross-border transactions. With a focus on financial inclusion, Stellar connects traditional financial institutions with blockchain-based solutions, enabling seamless value transfer across borders. Its partnership with IBM on the World Wire payment network demonstrates its ability to integrate with legacy systems while introducing the benefits of blockchain technology. Stellar‚Äôs Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) actively promotes ecosystem growth, funding initiatives to expand its use cases. With a transaction cost of fractions of a cent and near-instant processing times, Stellar is particularly suited for remittances and microtransactions. Its commitment to financial inclusion makes it a standout in regions where traditional banking systems are inaccessible. A Bright Future for US Blockchain Projects As the US enters a more crypto-friendly era, these American-made blockchains are well-positioned to lead the global market. From Constellation‚Äôs data-focused solutions to Stellar‚Äôs mission of financial inclusion, each network offers unique advantages that reflect the diversity and potential of the nation‚Äôs thriving blockchain industry. With pro-crypto leadership in Washington and the emergence of policies that encourage innovation, the stage is set for these US-centered blockchains to thrive. As blockchain technology continues to redefine finance, governance, and data security, these projects underscore America‚Äôs role as a driving force in delivering global blockchain solutions.

Ethereum price briefly taps $4k before tumbling On Monday, December 9, morning Ethereum (ETH) price briefly hit $4,000 for the first time since March, before pulling back to around $3,884.78 at press time. The ETH brief surge to $4k can be attributed to multiple factors including strong institutional interest through US spot Ethereum ETFs and whale activity that has injected substantial liquidity into the market. A particularly noteworthy development is the movement of Ethereum whales. On December 5, a long-dormant whale transferred 60,079 ETH worth $234 million into Bitfinex after nearly six years. This strategic move marked a major profit-taking opportunity, as the whale‚Äôs initial investment in January 2019 was only $13.4 million.

PEPE‚Äôs market cap has surged above $10 billion, placing it in the top 20 by market capitalization. This growth is driven by strong whale activity, which has seen a $1.14 billion increase in holdings over the weekend, signalling sustained bullish momentum.

The Coinbase listing has spurred a 70% increase in MOG‚Äôs value, bringing its market cap close to $1.44 billion and placing it among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Meme coins like MOG thrive on community engagement and internet hype, making them highly volatile and difficult to predict but also capable of significant gains in short time spans. Ethereum L2 solution token Movement (MOVE) gets listed on Upbit Movement (MOVE), an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, is another notable mention in the current crypto landscape as the week kicks off. Movement is designed to enhance scalability and transaction efficiency by supporting both MoveVM and EVM transactions, making it a viable solution for faster and more cost-effective Ethereum-based transactions.

Saylor‚Äôs artistic portrayal of Bitcoin has been the evangelist‚Äôs mandate since MicroStrategy adopted the asset in 2020. The chairman has unapologetically spread the Bitcoin gospel , leading MicroStrategy‚Äôs new ‚ÄúBitcoin bank‚Äù endgame.Meanwhile, Saylor‚Äôs recent description of how the United States can alter the BRICS‚Äôs attempt to demean its economy has caught the attention of Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser. The advisor to Nayib Bukele, El Salvador‚Äôs pro-Bitcoin president, raised his Bitcoin price prediction from $200,000 to $2.2 million in a Sunday tweet , citing Saylor‚Äôs grand gold rug pull masterclass.Saylor Proposes Strategy to Defend BRICS AttackIn an interview with Yahoo Finance, Saylor inferred that the United States could use Bitcoin to stop BRICS‚Äôs dollar harassment. He stated that a massive adoption of Bitcoin as a reserve asset would hedge against the attack on the US economy.The MicroStrategy chairman advised the US government to acquire 20% to 25% of Bitcoin‚Äôs circulating cap and store it as a global reserve asset. He argued that the move would steer a global Bitcoin buying spree, boosting the asset‚Äôs value and, consequently, the US economy.Furthermore, Saylor also teased a ‚Äúgreat twist‚Äù on the strategy, which involves the US selling all its gold reserves to stack Bitcoin. The chairman insisted the ploy would demonetize the entire gold asset class, affecting the US enemies, who hold a substantial amount of the precious metal.Notably, this plot would ensure that gold‚Äôs $20 billion market cap would shift to Bitcoin , rug-pulling holders of the asset class. Saylor noted that the twist will see the US control over $100 trillion in assets and the world‚Äôs reserve currency network.Keiser Says Strategy is FeasibleMeanwhile, the Bitcoin maxi insisted that Saylor‚Äôs gold rug pull strategy is largely feasible. He stated that the potential $20 billion market cap diversion from gold to Bitcoin has a ‚Äúvery high probability of success.‚ÄùKeiser implied that Saylor just revealed MicroStrategy‚Äôs incessant fixed-income market exploration endgame. He stated that the software firm has been raising funds from the $200 trillion sector to rug-pull gold, speculating that it would come to fruition.On this basis, Keiser raised his Bitcoin projection tenfold from $220,000 to $2.2 million. Notably, the price call still falls below Saylor‚Äôs $13 million Bitcoin prediction.Meanwhile, a surge to $2.2 million from the current market price of $98,680 would entail a 2,129% upsurge.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana is gearing up for a powerful rally to $290. Whale interest in Cardano and a rising DeFi coin could trigger a price surge. Table of Contents Solana faces major resistance on the way to $290 Cardano whales scoops 100m ADA as analyst forecasts rally to $1.5 Intel Markets brings AI into crypto trading Final thoughts Most top altcoins in the crypto market are currently in a consolidation phase after the recent price pump. One of them is Solana (SOL). Analysts forecast a breakout could occur in the coming weeks which could propel it to $290. On the other hand, whales are showing huge interest in Cardano (ADA) and a new DeFi coin called Intel Markets (INTL) . They have stocked millions of both coins recently, a move that could trigger a bull run in the coming weeks. Solana faces major resistance on the way to $290 Crypto analyst Pentoshi believes the Solana coin is getting ready for a price discovery after a long period of consolidation. Price information from CoinMarketCap shows Solana has been consolidating between $215 and $245 in the past week. The token‚Äôs value has dropped by 8.9% in the last 14 days. Nevertheless, analysts expect a trend reversal to occur in the coming weeks. ColdBloodShill predicts the Solana price could soar to $300 in the coming weeks. Another expert called The Moon Show expects an upside to $290. However, Raoul Pal has highlighted a major resistance around $260. According to him, breaking this level is crucial to the acceleration of the Solana crypto. Looking at Solana‚Äôs technical indicators, bulls are still active. The relative strength index is above the midline, signaling high buying pressure. Also, the Stoch RSI (14) is hinting at a potential upsurge as it flashes a buy signal. Cardano whales scoops 100m ADA as analyst forecasts rally to $1.5 In a recent tweet, top analyst Ali Martinez revealed that Cardano whales are on a buying spree. According to him, they bought over 100 million ADA in less than 24 hours. This increased buying activity could be the much-needed trigger to push the Cardano coin above the $1.30 resistance. Ali believes the altcoin has formed an ascending triangle. He forecasts the Cardano price could rally to $1.50 in the coming weeks. In the meantime, ADA is trading above the $1 level despite the recent downtrend the cryptocurrency has experienced. Data from CoinMarketCap shows the value of the Cardano token has increased by 228.0% on the monthly chart. The percentage increase in the weekly timeframe has dropped to 11.0%. Going forward, the sentiment surrounding Cardano is bullish. The relative strength index is in the overbought zone which signals high buying pressure. The Fear and Greed Index is also showing Greed, a sign investors are still optimistic.

37420022,https://coinpedia.org/?p=390968,1733741838,"Eigen Layer Analysis: Market Sentiment, Technical Patterns, and Key Levels","The post Eigen Layer Analysis: Market Sentiment, Technical Patterns, and Key Levels appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Eigen Layer (EIGEN) is quickly becoming one of the most intriguing cryptocurrencies on the market. With 99% of its investors currently in profit , it‚Äôs clear that EIGEN has captured attention for all the right reasons. Recently, a mysterious crypto whale made headlines by purchasing $7.25 million worth of EIGEN , sparking speculation about whether this is just the beginning of a major price rally. What makes this more fascinating is that EIGEN‚Äôs price has shown noticeable volatility in recent days. Let‚Äôs dive into the latest trends, technical patterns, and community sentiment to understand better. EIGEN‚Äôs Recent Market Movements EIGEN‚Äôs price has been making headlines with its recent ups and downs. The token recently peaked at its all-time high (ATH) of $5.06 , just two days ago, but has since fallen 8.69% from that high. Despite the recent decline, trading volume has surged 41.15% , reaching $290.06 million , indicating strong investor interest. Source : IntoTheBlock Current Investor Sentiment 99% of EIGEN holders are still in profit , while only 1% are at breakeven. Earlier this week, EIGEN dipped 1% , hitting a low of $4.44 , before recovering slightly to $4.60 , up 0.71% for the day. While these price fluctuations are common, the whale‚Äôs recent purchase suggests that long-term investor confidence remains strong. Could this purchase indicate a bullish shift for the token? Technical Analysis: What the Charts Are Telling Us Looking at technical indicators, things are a bit mixed for EIGEN. From a technical standpoint, EIGEN has been moving in an upward parallel channel since November 21 ‚Äîa pattern that typically signals bullish momentum. However, recent price action has shown some hurdles. After reaching its ATH, EIGEN faced rejection and fell back toward the median level of the upward channel for support. Source : Tradingview Key Technical Indicators to Watch: The 20-day moving average (MA20) is currently above the token‚Äôs price , suggesting there is no immediate support if the price drops further. A key level to watch is $4.02 . If EIGEN falls below this, it could trigger panic selling and a steeper price correction. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 55.11 , indicating that the market is neither oversold nor overbought‚Äîinvestors are still in a wait-and-watch mode. Community Sentiment vs. Market Actions While most investors are optimistic about EIGEN‚Äôs future, recent moves from high-profile market players have introduced uncertainty. Justin Sun, the founder of Tron , recently sold 322,119 EIGEN tokens worth $1.44 million . His ongoing sale of other assets has raised concerns in the market. The futures open interest has declined slightly by 0.2% , suggesting that the bullish rally might be losing some steam. Source : Coinglass Despite some investor concerns, Binance has shown its faith in EIGEN by adding it to its loanable assets and VIP loans earlier this year. This move is a significant indicator of trust from institutional investors and highlights EIGEN‚Äôs long-term potential in the market. What‚Äôs Next for EIGEN? The technical trends suggest caution, but market actions and investor sentiment are sending mixed signals. If EIGEN can maintain its position within the upward parallel channel , it could attempt another breakout. However, if the token falls below $4.02 , we might see a deeper correction. The whale‚Äôs $7.25 million purchase suggests optimism over the long term, even though short-term volatility remains. While community sentiment remains largely positive, recent market moves‚Äîparticularly by Justin Sun‚Äîhave introduced uncertainty. With the market in this state of flux, the question remains: Will the bullish whale purchases push EIGEN higher, or will the bears regain control? The upcoming days will be critical.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/is-eigen-going-for-another-rally-or-drop/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Microsoft shareholders vote on Tuesday Tuesday marks the day when Microsoft shareholders will vote on the proposal to add Bitcoin to the balance sheet of the tech giant. Given Bitcoin‚Äôs upward price momentum over the last couple of years, and with the likes of Blackrock and other trusted funds buying Bitcoin hand over fist for the last eleven months, it might be guessed that Microsoft shareholders would also be keen to dip their toes into this new world of sound digital money. However, for such a tech leviathan as Microsoft to move any of its treasury into Bitcoin would be a very large step indeed. Especially considering that the Microsoft board of directors has specifically counselled shareholders to vote ‚Äúno‚Äù to the proposition. That said, Michael Saylor, Chairman of MicroStrategy, which holds the largest amount of Bitcoin of any company treasury, managed to convince the Microsoft board to show a short 3-minute video of the advantages of adding Bitcoin to its treasury, during their shareholder meeting on Tuesday. Saylor said that three minutes was probably not enough for such an important consideration, so he decided to release the video he made across social media, so that shareholders would be able to see it and digest it properly before the vote. Amazon shareholders say board has a fiduciary responsibility Meanwhile, the board of commerce giant Amazon is also being asked to diversify its treasury by adding Bitcoin. A shareholder proposal urges the Amazon board to build at least a 5% treasury holding in Bitcoin. The proposal goes as far as to say that even though Bitcoin is volatile, the board has a fiduciary responsibility to add it to the balance sheet, given the likelihood that it will appreciate over time a lot more than bonds, or other such traditional assets. $BTC correctional phase continues Source: TradingView The $BTC price is still in a correctional phase. The short-term time frame shows that the price has just dipped under the 0.382 Fibonacci and that it may be coming down to stronger support at the 0.5 Fibonacci, and could also make a retest of the top of the triangle. The 0.618 Fibonacci is also at a strong horizontal level, and this would have the extra support of the bottom trendline of the triangle. $96,000 could be the bounce level Source: TradingView Looking at a very simple $BTC chart on the daily, it can be seen that there are three main horizontal support lines for the price action over the last month or so. The bears are currently battling with the first line, and if this breaks, the price can head down to the second, thicker line. This is in bold because it corresponds with the 0.618 fibonacci. If one takes into account the ascending trendline - where this bisects the middle support line would be a great place for the bulls to hold the line. A bounce here could then potentially confirm a continuation of the upward trend. If the correction continues below, the last line in the sand would be the bottom of the three horizontal support lines. Just below this a lower low could be made, and a much deeper correction might ensue. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While the international exchange expands its offerings with new listings, including Algorand and Moo Deng, reports of fraudulent activity and account restrictions have raised questions about Coinbase's customer experience and security measures. Coinbase Responds to Surge in Account Restrictions and Fraudulent Activities: Users Voice Concerns Over Support and Security Over the weekend, Coinbase found itself under scrutiny as several users reported sudden account restrictions on the platform. Complaints flooded social media, particularly X, where frustrated customers sought clarity. In response, Coinbase's @CoinbaseSupport account addressed the issue in a series of posts, urging users to exercise patience and caution. ‚ÄùPlease bear with us and don‚Äôt believe everything you see on Twitter,‚Äù the account emphasized. The recent surge in complaints coincides with reports of an uptick in phishing attacks and fraudulent schemes targeting Coinbase users. On Saturday night, pseudonymous security researcher and SEAL 911 team member @pcaversaccio shared alarming details about a wave of account compromises. ‚ÄùYesterday skiddies (again) decided to fake Coinbase support and drained multiple accounts,‚Äù he posted on X. The term ‚Äùskiddies,‚Äù short for ‚Äùscript kiddies,‚Äù refers to inexperienced hackers who rely on prewritten scripts to execute cyber exploits rather than creating their own tools. These opportunistic attackers have increasingly targeted digital asset platforms, leveraging deceptive methods to trick unsuspecting users into revealing sensitive information. In its thread on X, Coinbase acknowledged the heightened activity, attributing it partly to a significant influx of new and returning users post-election. ‚ÄùAlong with this surge, as is typical with surges, we‚Äôve seen a 2-3x increase in fraudulent attempts,‚Äù the @CoinbaseSupport account wrote. Despite these challenges, Coinbase highlighted the effectiveness of its fraud-prevention systems, claiming they had saved customers ‚Äùtens of millions in losses in November alone.‚Äù However, Coinbase‚Äôs efforts to combat fraudulent activities have not been without criticism. Users and security experts have voiced concerns over the exchange‚Äôs reliance on stringent account security measures, which some argue are overly sensitive and prone to false positives. The VPN Debate: Balancing Security and Usability Coinbase‚Äôs stance on VPN use has sparked particular controversy. In a Dec. 2 post, Scott Shapiro, Coinbase‚Äôs product director, explained that attackers frequently use VPNs, making them a potential red flag in the platform‚Äôs risk models. However, Shapiro clarified that VPN usage alone would not trigger account restrictions. Instead, it is flagged when combined with other risk factors, such as logins from unknown devices in unfamiliar locations attempting to transfer large sums of cryptocurrency. Critics, including rival exchange Kraken‚Äôs chief security officer Nick Percoco, have pushed back against Coinbase‚Äôs approach. ‚ÄùA VPN is your digital armor,‚Äù @pcaversaccio wrote, emphasizing its necessity for users who rely on public Wi-Fi or seek to protect their privacy. Percoco went further, suggesting Coinbase‚Äôs measures could force users to choose between financial freedom and personal safety. Another point of contention has been Coinbase‚Äôs customer support. Users have reported delays in receiving assistance, exacerbating frustration over account restrictions and fraudulent activity. Taylor Monahan, principal security researcher at Metamask, critiqued Coinbase‚Äôs lack of weekend support, sarcastically remarking, ‚ÄùCrypto operates 9-5 PT Monday-Friday, and no one victimizes your users outside those hours either.‚Äù Coinbase acknowledged the challenges, admitting to a ‚Äùminor increase in restricted accounts and elevated CX wait times‚Äù due to the spike in fraud attempts. ‚ÄùIf you are restricted, we‚Äôre not ignoring you; we‚Äôre working hard to respond asap,‚Äù @CoinbaseSupport assured users. While Coinbase maintains its systems are acting as expected, the platform's handling of the situation has drawn mixed reactions. Some users have praised its proactive fraud prevention, while others have expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of timely communication and perceived overreach in account restrictions. The exchange‚Äôs challenges place the spotlight on the delicate balance between maintaining robust security measures and providing a seamless user experience. With the cryptocurrency market operating 24/7, platforms like Coinbase face mounting pressure to meet user expectations without compromising on safety. Coinbase International Celebrates Milestone with 100th Perpetual Futures Contract Listing In related news, Coinbase International has reached a significant milestone with the listing of its 100th perpetual futures contract. In a celebratory tweet, Coinbase International stated, ‚ÄùWe‚Äôve officially listed our 100th perpetual future on Coinbase International Exchange. That‚Äôs 100 unique opportunities for you to diversify, trade, and grow.‚Äù This milestone is indicative of Coinbase's dedication to innovation in the derivatives space and its ongoing efforts to cater to a growing international user base seeking advanced trading options. However, Coinbase International is not stopping at 100. The exchange has announced the addition of four new perpetual futures contracts, which will be available starting Dec. 12. The new listings include: Moo Deng (MOODENG) Algorand (ALGO) The Sandbox (SAND) Mog Coin (1000MOG) These listings will be accessible to traders on both Coinbase International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced, further broadening the range of assets available for trading. Moo Deng is a Solana-based meme coin inspired by a famous Thai zoo hippo of the same name. Known for its quirky branding and community-driven appeal, Moo Deng has garnered significant attention in the meme coin ecosystem. At the time of writing, Moo Deng's price had dropped by 15.64% in the last 24 hours, reaching $0.4521. Algorand stands out as a blockchain platform emphasizing energy efficiency and security. Its single-layer architecture is designed for instant transaction finality, high throughput, and low fees. ALGO, the native cryptocurrency of the Algorand blockchain, was trading at $0.482, down 3.24% in the last 24 hours. The Sandbox is a virtual metaverse platform where users can create, own, and monetize gaming experiences using non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The SAND token serves as the ecosystem‚Äôs primary utility token. Over the past 24 hours, SAND suffered a drop of 5.02%, trading at $0.8751. Mog Coin, an Ethereum-based meme coin, has captured headlines with its meteoric rise. Recently, it reached an all-time high of $0.000004, but has since settled at $0.000003761. Coinbase International‚Äôs Growing Influence The listing of the 100th perpetual futures contract marks a pivotal moment for Coinbase International as it strengthens its foothold in the global derivatives market. Perpetual futures, a key offering in the crypto trading space, allow traders to speculate on asset price movements without the constraints of an expiry date. This flexibility has made perpetual futures a popular choice among experienced traders. Coinbase‚Äôs expansion into derivatives comes as part of a broader strategy to tap into the rapidly growing international crypto markets. By introducing diverse assets and advanced trading features, Coinbase aims to attract a more sophisticated trading audience while keeping up with competitors like Binance and Bybit, which dominate the derivatives market. As Coinbase International continues to expand its portfolio of perpetual futures contracts, it signals a clear ambition to remain at the forefront of global crypto trading innovation. The introduction of new assets like Moo Deng, Algorand, The Sandbox, and Mog Coin demonstrate the exchange‚Äôs dual focus on supporting both established and emerging digital assets. With an increasing number of traders turning to derivatives as a means of hedging and leveraging their positions, Coinbase‚Äôs proactive approach to expanding its offerings is likely to bolster its appeal among retail and institutional investors alike. As the global crypto landscape evolves, Coinbase International's continued focus on expanding its offerings and improving user experience positions it as a key player in the competitive cryptocurrency derivatives market.",NEGATIVE,ALGO | MOG,ALGO | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | MOG,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6427/coinbase-faces-backlash-over-restricted-accounts-and-support-delays,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

In an interview on 60 Minutes, Garlinghouse acknowledged that while Trump was once skeptical of cryptocurrencies, he now openly supports the industry, and the feeling appears to be mutual. Trump‚Äôs earlier stance on Bitcoin was far from friendly. Back in 2021, he labeled Bitcoin a scam, arguing it posed a threat to the U.S. dollar‚Äôs dominance. Trump expressed his desire for the dollar to remain the world‚Äôs primary currency, and his comments sparked criticism from some within the crypto community. However, Trump‚Äôs perspective seems to have shifted dramatically. When asked about this transformation, Garlinghouse avoided delving into Trump‚Äôs past views but instead emphasized the present, stating, ‚ÄúDonald Trump embraced crypto, and crypto embraced Donald Trump.‚Äù This acknowledgment underscores the significant change in Trump‚Äôs approach toward the digital asset space. During his presidential campaign, Trump consistently voiced his support for the cryptocurrency sector. He outlined plans to foster crypto adoption in the United States and pledged to implement pro-crypto policies if elected. Since winning the presidency, he has already begun taking steps to fulfill these promises. One of Trump‚Äôs notable actions was appointing several crypto-friendly individuals to key positions in his administration. Among them was Paul Atkins , a well-known supporter of digital assets, who replaced Gary Gensler as chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). This move was seen as a clear signal of Trump‚Äôs commitment to fostering a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. The impact of Trump‚Äôs crypto-positive actions has been profound. His support has fueled optimism in the market, with Bitcoin reaching new milestones and gaining wider acceptance among investors. The crypto community views Trump‚Äôs leadership as an opportunity for the industry to achieve greater recognition and regulatory clarity in the United States. Garlinghouse‚Äôs remarks reflect the growing alignment between Trump and the cryptocurrency world. While the reasons for Trump‚Äôs change of heart remain unclear, his current support for digital assets has undoubtedly bolstered confidence within the industry. As his presidency unfolds, the crypto community will likely continue to watch closely, hopeful that Trump‚Äôs actions will further legitimize and advance the adoption of digital currencies.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/trump-turns-pro-crypto-ripple-ceo-reacts,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37419862.jpeg

Analysts are now predicting the crypto will continue leading the memecoin market, staying ahead of popular coins DOGE, SHIB, UNI and LTC. According to data from crypto market data tracker CoinMarketCap, memecoin PEPE now ranks 20th on the crypto market cap list, going past Uniswap (UNI) and Litecoin (LTC). The coin‚Äôs recent price surge has extended its year-to-date (YTD) gains to an impressive 1,550%, setting it at a prime position to outperform rival memecoins Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) by the end of FY2024. Crypto market analysts have attributed the recent price uptick to speculation that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under a potential Trump administration could approve policy changes facilitating staking yield for crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Such a shift, per analysts from Bernstein, could enable ETFs tracking spot prices of Proof-of-Stake coins like Ethereum to stake their holdings, which may exponentially boost yields for investors. PEPE market cap outperforms DOGE, SHIB PEPE‚Äôs price jumped by 33.9% in just a few days, moving from $0.000020 to $0.000028 between December 5 and December 9. As a result, the memecoin‚Äôs market cap broke past $11 billion, making it the 20th largest crypto globally. Notably, the coin‚Äôs price has risen by almost 140% in the last 30 days, outperforming DOGE and SHIB‚Äôs 30 day price upticks, recording at 113% and 60% respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap The crypto coin‚Äôs rise has also been reflected in its growing demand. In the three days leading up to December 9, PEPE saw a surge in new addresses, with 13,030 new wallets created. The growth trend indicates the market sentiment could be more than short-term speculation, and the coin may have gained sustained interest from new market entrants. The coin‚Äôs price upward trajectory was also fueled by FOX News business talks, which mentioned PEPE and Bitcoin as ‚Äúvery good investments.‚Äù Whale activity boosts PEPE positive price rise Recent data from IntoTheBlock shows a dramatic shift in the crypto coin‚Äôs whale activity, with large holders moving from a net inflow of over 1 billion PEPE on December 6 to a significant net outflow of nearly 2 trillion PEPE by December 8. This type of sell-off, often seen as a sign of profit-taking or panic, typically results in price declines. However, PEPE‚Äôs price has remained resilient, posting a 27.3% surge over the past week, unaffected by the whale sell-offs. In addition, PEPE‚Äôs open interest (OI) has hit new highs. Per CoinGlass data, the coin‚Äôs OI levels have increased to $370.8 million, reflecting a 9% rise in just 24 hours. The number of short-term PEPE holders has surged by 263% in the past month, reaching 80,450 unique addresses, further supporting the upward market price momentum. Source: CoinGlass Market analysts are increasingly bullish on the coin‚Äôs future price action. Technical analysis suggests a bullish outlook for PEPE, with key patterns indicating further price growth. According to Analyst Captain Faibik, the coin has broken out of a multi-month symmetrical triangle, potentially driving the price up to $0.000031, marking a 19% increase from current levels. Similarly, a chart expert on X using the pseudonym Chandler Bing noted the formation of a Cup and Handle pattern, a rare bullish signal in technical analysis, which suggests that the coin‚Äôs rally could continue in the short term. $PEPE has formed a cup and handle pattern, signaling a potential breakout.

37419742,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108377,1733741247,"U.S. Spot ETFs Hold Over 1.1 Million Bitcoin, Valued at $111 Billion","In the rapidly evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investments, Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have emerged as a pivotal vehicle for institutional and retail investors seeking exposure to digital assets without the complexities of direct ownership. A recent disclosure by crypto investor HODL15Capital on X (formerly known as Twitter) has shed light on a significant milestone: U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively hold over 1.1 million Bitcoin , valued at an impressive $111 billion in assets under management (AUM). This development underscores the growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin and signals a transformative phase for the cryptocurrency market. Understanding Spot Bitcoin ETFs What are Spot Bitcoin ETFs? A Spot Bitcoin ETF is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges that directly holds Bitcoin as its underlying asset. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which derive their value from Bitcoin futures contracts, spot ETFs provide investors with direct exposure to Bitcoin‚Äôs current market price. This direct holding mechanism ensures that the ETF‚Äôs performance closely mirrors the actual price movements of Bitcoin, offering a more transparent and straightforward investment avenue. The Mechanics of Spot Bitcoin ETFs Spot Bitcoin ETFs operate by holding Bitcoin in custody on behalf of their investors. The ETF issues shares that represent fractional ownership of the total Bitcoin held in the fund. Investors can buy and sell these shares on traditional stock exchanges, just like they would with any other ETF or stock. This structure allows for seamless integration of Bitcoin into conventional investment portfolios, eliminating the need for investors to manage digital wallets, private keys, or navigate cryptocurrency exchanges directly. Regulatory Approval and Significance The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by regulatory bodies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) marks a significant milestone in the mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Regulatory approval not only legitimizes Bitcoin as an investment asset but also paves the way for broader institutional participation. It provides a regulated framework that ensures investor protection, transparency, and compliance with financial standards, making Bitcoin accessible to a wider range of investors, including those who were previously hesitant due to regulatory uncertainties. The Milestone: 1.1 Million Bitcoin Held by U.S. Spot ETFs Breakdown of the Holdings As of December 6, 2024, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have amassed a total of 1,108,419 Bitcoin , with an estimated total value of $111 billion . This figure represents a substantial portion of the total Bitcoin in circulation and signifies a major influx of institutional capital into the cryptocurrency market. Comparative Analysis with Past Data To contextualize this milestone, it‚Äôs essential to examine the historical trajectory of Bitcoin ETFs: Launch of First Bitcoin ETFs: The first Bitcoin ETFs were launched in Canada in early 2021, providing Canadian investors with regulated exposure to Bitcoin. The U.S. followed suit later, with the SEC approving spot Bitcoin ETFs in late 2023, albeit with stringent regulatory conditions. Growth Over Time: Since their inception, Bitcoin ETFs have experienced exponential growth. From a modest AUM at launch, the combined holdings have surged to over 1.1 million Bitcoin within a relatively short period, reflecting robust investor interest and confidence in the asset class. Institutional Adoption: The steady increase in Bitcoin holdings by ETFs indicates a broader trend of institutional adoption. Major financial institutions, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Vanguard, have launched their Bitcoin ETF products, attracting significant investments from pension funds, endowments, and other large-scale investors. Drivers Behind the Growth Several factors have contributed to the surge in Bitcoin holdings by U.S. spot ETFs: Institutional Confidence: Institutional investors view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, driving substantial inflows into ETFs that provide exposure without the need for direct ownership. Regulatory Clarity: The SEC‚Äôs approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has provided the necessary regulatory framework, reducing uncertainties and encouraging more investors to participate. Market Maturity: As the cryptocurrency market matures, with improved infrastructure, security, and liquidity, Bitcoin ETFs become a more attractive and reliable investment option. Diversification Benefits: ETFs offer diversification benefits, allowing investors to integrate Bitcoin into their portfolios alongside traditional assets like stocks, bonds, and commodities. Implications for the Cryptocurrency Market Enhanced Liquidity and Market Stability The substantial holdings of Bitcoin by ETFs enhance the overall liquidity of the cryptocurrency market. Increased liquidity facilitates smoother trading, reduces price volatility, and ensures that large transactions can be executed without significant market disruptions. This stability is crucial for attracting more institutional and retail investors, fostering a more resilient and robust market environment. Price Appreciation Potential The inflow of $111 billion into spot Bitcoin ETFs exerts upward pressure on Bitcoin prices. As ETFs purchase large quantities of Bitcoin to meet investor demand, the increased demand coupled with limited supply can drive significant price appreciation. Historically, similar inflows have led to bullish trends, contributing to rapid price surges during periods of high institutional investment. Institutional Legitimacy and Mainstream Acceptance The growing presence of Bitcoin ETFs signifies a broader institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies. As more reputable financial institutions manage substantial Bitcoin holdings, the stigma surrounding digital assets diminishes, promoting mainstream acceptance. This legitimization can lead to further institutional participation, enhancing the overall credibility and stability of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Impact on Alternative Investments The rise of Bitcoin ETFs presents both opportunities and challenges for alternative investment vehicles. Traditional hedge funds, private equity firms, and venture capital funds may increasingly incorporate Bitcoin into their portfolios to align with institutional trends and capitalize on the growth potential of digital assets. Conversely, alternative investments that fail to adapt to the evolving market dynamics may face reduced attractiveness and competitiveness. Institutional Adoption and Market Dynamics The Role of Major Financial Institutions Leading financial institutions have been at the forefront of Bitcoin ETF adoption. Firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco have launched their own Bitcoin ETF products, leveraging their extensive client bases and financial expertise to attract substantial investments. These institutions bring credibility, operational efficiency, and robust risk management practices to the cryptocurrency market, fostering greater trust and confidence among investors. Strategic Investment Strategies Institutional investors employ various strategies to maximize the benefits of Bitcoin ETFs: Hedging Portfolios: Institutions use Bitcoin ETFs to hedge against macroeconomic risks, such as inflation and currency depreciation, ensuring portfolio resilience during economic downturns. Diversification: Incorporating Bitcoin ETFs into diversified portfolios enhances overall returns and reduces risk exposure by providing access to a high-growth asset class. Strategic Allocation: Institutions allocate a portion of their assets to Bitcoin ETFs based on their risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals, optimizing portfolio performance. Competitive Landscape The Bitcoin ETF market is becoming increasingly competitive as more financial institutions enter the space. Differentiating factors among ETFs include fee structures, asset management strategies, and the extent of institutional backing. This competition drives innovation, leading to the development of more sophisticated investment products that cater to diverse investor needs and preferences. Potential for Further Growth Given the current momentum, the Bitcoin ETF market is poised for continued growth. Factors such as broader regulatory acceptance, increasing institutional confidence, and technological advancements in the cryptocurrency space will likely drive further inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. As the market matures, Bitcoin ETFs may become a standard component of institutional and retail investment portfolios, fostering sustained growth and stability. Regulatory Considerations and Challenges The SEC‚Äôs Stance on Bitcoin ETFs The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC marks a significant regulatory milestone. However, regulatory scrutiny remains a critical factor influencing the growth and sustainability of Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC continues to monitor the cryptocurrency market closely, ensuring that ETFs adhere to stringent regulatory standards designed to protect investors and maintain market integrity. Compliance and Transparency Bitcoin ETFs must comply with various regulatory requirements, including: Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC): ETFs must implement robust AML and KYC protocols to prevent illicit activities and ensure transparent operations. Custodial Standards: Ensuring secure and reliable custody solutions for holding Bitcoin is essential to safeguard investor assets and maintain trust. Reporting and Disclosure: Regular reporting and transparent disclosure practices are mandatory to provide investors with accurate and timely information about ETF holdings, performance, and risk factors. Potential Regulatory Changes As the cryptocurrency market evolves, regulatory frameworks are likely to undergo significant changes. Potential developments include: Enhanced Regulatory Oversight: The SEC may introduce more comprehensive regulations to address emerging risks and challenges associated with Bitcoin ETFs, including market manipulation, insider trading, and fraud. Global Regulatory Harmonization: Coordinated efforts among international regulatory bodies could lead to standardized regulations for Bitcoin ETFs, facilitating cross-border investments and reducing regulatory arbitrage. Innovative Compliance Solutions: Advancements in blockchain analytics and regulatory technology (RegTech) can enhance compliance and transparency, ensuring that Bitcoin ETFs meet evolving regulatory standards. Impact of Regulatory Developments on Bitcoin ETFs Regulatory changes can have profound effects on Bitcoin ETFs: Positive Developments: Favorable regulations can boost investor confidence, attract more institutional investments, and drive further growth in Bitcoin ETF holdings. Negative Developments: Stricter regulations or unfavorable policies can constrain the growth of Bitcoin ETFs, limit investor participation, and create operational challenges for asset managers. Market Sentiment and Investor Behavior The Psychology Behind the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Market sentiment plays a pivotal role in the cryptocurrency market, influencing price movements, investment decisions, and overall market dynamics. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a barometer for investor sentiment, categorizing the market‚Äôs emotional state based on factors like volatility, trading volume, social media activity, and more. Current Sentiment: Extreme Greed With the Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently at 78 , the market remains in the ‚ÄòExtreme Greed‚Äô zone. This high sentiment level reflects strong investor confidence, robust buying activity, and an overall bullish outlook. Extreme greed often precedes significant price movements, either upward due to continued investment inflows or downward as market corrections ensue. Implications of Extreme Greed for Bitcoin ETFs Increased Investment Activity: High sentiment levels can drive more investments into Bitcoin ETFs, amplifying the inflow of capital and boosting AUM. Price Momentum: Continued extreme greed can sustain Bitcoin‚Äôs price momentum, encouraging further ETF investments and potentially leading to new all-time highs. Risk of Overvaluation: Prolonged periods of extreme greed can lead to overvaluation, increasing the risk of market corrections that may impact Bitcoin ETFs negatively. Balancing Sentiment with Fundamentals While market sentiment provides valuable insights, it‚Äôs essential to balance emotional factors with fundamental analysis. Investors and asset managers should assess the underlying value, technological advancements, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic trends to make informed investment decisions, rather than solely relying on sentiment indicators. The Future of Bitcoin ETFs and Institutional Investments Projected Growth Trajectory Given the current holdings and market trends, Bitcoin ETFs are expected to continue their upward trajectory. Factors such as increasing institutional adoption, technological innovations, and favorable regulatory developments will likely drive further growth in Bitcoin ETF holdings and AUM. Potential for New ETF Products As the market matures, we can anticipate the introduction of more specialized Bitcoin ETF products, catering to different investor needs and preferences. Examples include: Thematic ETFs: Focused on specific aspects of the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as mining, blockchain technology, or environmental sustainability. Leveraged ETFs: Designed for investors seeking amplified exposure to Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements through the use of leverage. Multi-Crypto ETFs: Offering exposure to a basket of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major digital assets, providing diversified investment options within a single ETF. Integration with Traditional Financial Systems Bitcoin ETFs will increasingly integrate with traditional financial systems, bridging the gap between conventional finance and the cryptocurrency market. This integration can facilitate seamless investment processes, enhance liquidity, and promote greater acceptance of digital assets among mainstream investors. Technological Advancements and Infrastructure Development Continued advancements in blockchain technology, cybersecurity, and financial infrastructure will enhance the operational efficiency and security of Bitcoin ETFs. Innovations such as decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, improved custodial solutions, and real-time tracking systems will further bolster the attractiveness and reliability of Bitcoin ETFs as a preferred investment vehicle. Global Expansion and Cross-Border Investments As regulatory frameworks evolve and Bitcoin ETFs gain global acceptance, cross-border investments in Bitcoin ETFs will become more prevalent. International investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin will leverage U.S. spot ETFs as a reliable and regulated investment option, driving global capital flows into the cryptocurrency market. Conclusion The U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs holding over 1.1 million Bitcoin , valued at $111 billion , marks a significant milestone in the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. This development underscores the growing confidence of major financial institutions in Bitcoin as a viable and strategic investment asset. The substantial investment inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs enhance market liquidity, drive price appreciation, and contribute to the overall stability of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. BlackRock‚Äôs aggressive investment in Bitcoin ETFs and the ongoing support from other leading asset managers reflect a transformative shift in how traditional finance interacts with digital assets. Regulatory approvals, technological advancements, and the maturation of the cryptocurrency market continue to propel Bitcoin ETFs into the mainstream investment landscape. However, this growth trajectory is not without challenges. Regulatory uncertainties, market volatility, and the potential for overvaluation pose significant risks that must be navigated with strategic foresight and robust risk management practices. Balancing market sentiment with fundamental analysis will be crucial for investors and asset managers to sustain growth and mitigate risks associated with extreme greed and speculative investments. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, Bitcoin ETFs will play an increasingly pivotal role in shaping the future of digital finance. By providing a regulated, accessible, and transparent investment vehicle, Bitcoin ETFs bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies, paving the way for broader adoption and integration of digital assets into global financial systems. For investors seeking to capitalize on the growth potential of Bitcoin while maintaining exposure to a regulated investment vehicle, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs represent a compelling option. As these ETFs continue to attract substantial investments and expand their holdings, they will undoubtedly influence the trajectory of Bitcoin‚Äôs market dynamics and the overall landscape of institutional investments in the cryptocurrency space.

37419745,https://coinpaprika.com/news/peter-schiff-calls-bitcoin-a-national-threat,1733741233,Peter Schiff Calls Bitcoin a National Threat,"Renowned gold advocate and long-time Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff has once again sparked debate with his latest remarks on the cryptocurrency. Using X (formerly Twitter), Schiff declared Bitcoin to be a ""national security threat,"" claiming its misuse and growing prominence harm economic efficiency and divert resources from productive sectors. Schiff accused Bitcoin supporters of using the cryptocurrency to influence government officials, calling it a misuse of public funds. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one thing when private citizens waste their money on Bitcoin,‚Äù he stated, ‚Äúbut bribing officials to squander public money on it makes Bitcoin public enemy number one.‚Äù This comment aligns with his ongoing criticism of Bitcoin as a speculative bubble and contrasts sharply with the cryptocurrency‚Äôs rising institutional adoption. Despite his assertions, Bitcoin continues to gain traction. Its adoption by institutional investors and the success of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are key milestones. Reports indicate that these ETFs now hold more Bitcoin than the estimated 1.1 million BTC owned by its mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Schiff also argued that Bitcoin misdirects investment away from essential sectors, undermining economic productivity. ""Bitcoin is not a threat to gold but to the U.S. economy,"" he stated, adding that public investments in Bitcoin could worsen capital misallocation, further harming productive businesses. Schiff has consistently dismissed Bitcoin as lacking the intrinsic value he believes makes gold superior. The cryptocurrency community has widely mocked Schiff‚Äôs claims. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, sarcastically noted Bitcoin's evolution in Schiff's narrative. ‚ÄúIn 11 months, Bitcoin went from a sinking ship to a national security threat... You love to see it,‚Äù Geraci quipped. The debate surrounding Bitcoin remains heated, with critics frequently highlighting its use in illegal activities and its challenge to national currencies. Supporters counter these arguments, emphasizing Bitcoin‚Äôs potential as a financial innovation and hedge against inflation. Schiff‚Äôs criticisms, while controversial, continue to influence discussions about Bitcoin's role in the global economy . Prominent Bitcoin advocates also joined the conversation. Erik Voorhees responded to Schiff‚Äôs claims, sarcastically pointing out broader economic issues like the $36 trillion U.S. national debt , which overshadow Bitcoin‚Äôs impact. Schiff‚Äôs consistent focus on Bitcoin, while championing gold, underscores the growing importance of digital assets in modern financial debates. Adding to the controversy, Schiff recently suggested that Trump Media should invest in Bitcoin, a comment some viewed as ironic given his strong criticisms. Despite his disdain for Bitcoin, Schiff has endorsed Donald Trump in the 2024 U.S. presidential race, highlighting the complex and often contradictory aspects of his public persona. As the debate continues, Schiff‚Äôs stance resonates with a segment of his audience while fueling backlash from the crypto community. His views, though polarizing, reflect the increasing prominence of cryptocurrencies in economic and political discussions, making Bitcoin a central figure in debates about the future of finance.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/peter-schiff-calls-bitcoin-a-national-threat,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37419745.jpeg

The ARB price reached a high of $1.23 on December 6, the highest level for the cryptocurrency since May. Gains over the past week currently stand at over 14%, while daily trading volume has increased nearly 8% to more than $699 million. What next for Arbitrum price? While the ARB token has pared some of the gains with a 24-hour slip of about 5%, Mechanism Capital partner Andrew Kang says Arbitrum is largely undervalued.

How Do They Stack Up Against the Hottest Crypto Rollblock?,"Are you monitoring the most popular cryptocurrencies currently? As the Solana price experiences a decline, the Chainlink price is surging, creating a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market. However, another contender is emerging‚ÄîRollblock. The ninth presale has generated almost $6.9 million, and with the token priced at $0.041, it is garnering significant interest. How do Solana, Chainlink, and Rollblock compare to one another? Let us discuss the reasons why Rollblock might be your next major cryptocurrency investment. Rollblock: Staking rewards, global reach, and transparency make it the hottest crypto to watch as the year comes to an end You‚Äôve probably heard of big players like Solana and Chainlink, but have you met Rollblock yet? This rising crypto is quickly rubbing shoulders with the giants, and it‚Äôs easy to see why. For starters, RBLK holders enjoy generous staking rewards, meaning your tokens can work for you while you sit back and watch Rollblock‚Äôs journey unfold. But that‚Äôs not all! Rollblock is expanding its utility, forming partnerships and exploring future applications that could make it an even bigger name in the crypto world. With more uses and real-world adoption, Rollblock is looking to be a game-changer. What about transparency? You‚Äôll love this ‚Äì Rollblock operates on blockchain technology, meaning all transactions are permanent and immutable. No funny business here! You can trust that everything is above board. Plus, Rollblock is spreading its wings globally with a wide operational reach. Licensing agreements are helping it grow its user base across regions, giving you even more reasons to jump on board this exciting crypto. Ready to join the ride? Solana price faces a crucial test: Will the bearish trend hold or reverse? The Solana price chart may be forming a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern, which has added to market instability. This trend might break the $230 support level and down Solana prices by 12%. On-chain signs show less interest, indicating whales are transferring SOL to exchanges, which may foreshadow further selling pressure. Ignoring this, there is some optimism for the future of Solana since the Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that a recovery is still within the realm of possibility. Traders are closely monitoring these important levels as the Solana price changes. Many are wondering what the future holds for the popular blockchain. Can Chainlink price sustain its 74% rally, or is a pullback looming? The Chainlink price rose 74% in three weeks to a six-month high around $27. Strong buying pressure was indicated by the rally breaking exponential moving averages (EMAs). After testing this resistance level, the Chainlink price must decide whether to surge over $27 or drop. Many traders still have long positions, indicating market optimism. The Chainlink price might reach $30 if it breaks over the $25 barrier. If resistance persists, a drop to $15 support may occur, depending on market conditions. Solana and Chainlink are great, but Rollblock might just be your next big crypto move So, while Solana and Chainlink are grabbing headlines with their price swings, Rollblock might just be the one to watch. With strong staking rewards, a global footprint, and transparent blockchain tech, RBLK is shaping up to be a real contender. It‚Äôs exciting, growing fast, and could be your next crypto success!

37420312,https://invezz.com/?p=2379309,1733741000,Should you invest in iDEGEN as Jim Cramer reiterates bullish view on crypto?,"Significant rallies in cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin have turned many into a believer. Even notable names like Jim Cramer are bullish on the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency by market cap and apparently have been so since 2020 when he first secured exposure to the BTC. But it hasn‚Äôt been the giants like Bitcoin only that have attracted solid demand in 2024. Meme coins have seen massive interest as well primarily because of their explosive potential in the early stages. If you‚Äôre on the lookout for one such meme coin that is yet to have its moment in the sun, you might want to take a look at iDEGEN . Why is BTC optimism relevant for iDEGEN? Jim Cramer recently revealed to have made enough money out of Ethereum as well that helped him ‚Äúbuy a large farm in an undisclosed location‚Äù. The Mad Money host is positive on the crypto industry predominantly because Donald Trump has vowed to ‚Äúgo all in on Bitcoin‚Äù after taking the office in January. He even plans on setting up a strategic Bitcoin reserve. ‚ÄúIf crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted, and made in the USA,‚Äù Trump disclosed in his address on July 27 th . The President-elect has even met with executives of the biggest crypto mining companies to discuss the possibility of such a reserve. Now, had it been oil, and Trump had met oil executives to build a strategic oil reserve, ‚Äúyou would have wanted to bet on oil [following] a Trump victory.‚Äù So why not on BTC, Cramer argued last week. His comment and Trump‚Äôs commitment to Bitcoin is meaningful for iDEGEN as the crypto pioneer tends to set the direction for the rest of the industry. If it continues to rally under the Trump administration, the broader crypto industry, hopefully including iDEGEN could benefit significantly. Click here if you‚Äôd like to invest in iDEGEN today. iDEGEN is firing on all cylinders during presale iDEGEN is a retail investor friendly way of playing the expected strength in cryptocurrencies under Donald Trump as the President of the United States. Why? Because unlike Bitcoin or even Ethereum, it‚Äôs valued at pennies only at writing. So, nobody has to break a bank to build a sizable position in this up-and-coming meme coin. iDEGEN‚Äôs ongoing presale has raised more than $3.4 million in less than a month also because it offers exposure to another fast-growing market ‚Äì artificial intelligence. iDEGEN relies on AI to learn from what the community posts on X. iDEGEN‚Äôs tends to jump once every 10 minutes as long as certain conditions are met. But the real returns will likely shower once it goes live on a crypto exchange after the presale as a listing typically makes a meme coin much more accessible for crypto enthusiasts.

According to a December 6 investigation update, cybersecurity firm Mandiant attributed the attack to a Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea (DPRK)-aligned threat actor identified as ‚ÄúUNC4736,‚Äù also known as ‚ÄúCitrine Sleet.‚Äù Malware Delivered Through Telegram The breach began on September 11, when a Radiant developer received a Telegram message from an individual posing as a former contractor. The message included a ZIP file purportedly seeking feedback on a new project. Upon review, the file was determined to have contained malware. The domain associated with the file spoofed the contractor‚Äôs legitimate website, making the deception highly convincing. Once the malware infiltrated developer devices, it allowed attackers to gain control of private keys and smart contracts. The platform halted lending operations on October 16 after malicious transactions were executed under the guise of routine activities. Sophisticated Tactics in Radiant Hack Radiant highlighted the advanced techniques employed by the hackers, who exploited the DeFi platform‚Äôs reliance on blind signing and front-end verifications. The malware further spoofed transaction data on user interfaces, rendering traditional checks and simulations ineffective. ‚ÄúEven with best practices, such as hardware wallets, transaction simulations, and standard operating procedures, the attackers executed their deception seamlessly,‚Äù Radiant noted. North Korean hacking collectives, notably the Lazarus Group, have a history of targeting crypto platforms , stealing over $3 billion in assets between 2017 and 2023. In this case, the attackers transferred $52 million of stolen funds on October 24, causing a severe blow to Radiant‚Äôs operations. This incident is not Radiant‚Äôs first setback this year. In January, the platform suffered a $4.5 million flash loan exploit. Following these events, Radiant‚Äôs total value locked (TVL) has plummeted from over $300 million at the start of the year to approximately $5.81 million, according to DefiLlama. Radiant underscored the need for hardware-level solutions to counteract advanced threats. As the DeFi sector continues to grow , attacks like these highlight the critical importance of bolstering cybersecurity measures to safeguard user funds and platform integrity.

In September 2024, the daily average trading volume on the blockchain increased from $2 million to $17.2 million, corresponding to a growth of 760% year-to-date . Tap-to-earn (T2E) games are one of the primary reasons for TON's success. This guide explores three of the most appealing T2E projects and the best way for novices to enter the gaming niche. As with all phenomena, malicious actors are quick to enter the ecosystem, so we will also look at the signs of subpar T2E games or outright scams. Catizen Catizen , a cat-themed game on TON, combines AI, metaverse elements, and GameFi. Players adopt virtual cats and perform tapping actions to earn tokens. The game became popular for its community features and appealing graphics, allowing players to care for lovely cats while interacting with each other. Catizen also offers unique rewards for taking part in events and completing tasks. As of December 2024, Catizen had 3.27 million on-chain users, 7,908,055 channel subscribers, and 296,875 daily players. The total number of ecosystem participants comes to an impressive 45.34 million, according to information published on the official website. Its seed round received investments not only from TON but also from Moon Capital, Mask Network, Y2Z, Web3 Ventures, EMURGO Ventures, and SecondLive. While many T2E games have risen rapidly only to fizzle out, this one continues to show engagement from players due to its innovative mechanics, such as building a cat-themed city, leveling up characters, and earning tokens through tasks and missions. Its integration with TON and the ability to stake or exchange earned tokens for real-world value help sustain its appeal. The game is fun for fans of casual mobile gaming and blockchain integration. Still, it has faced criticism for repetitive gameplay and high reliance on in-game purchases to progress faster. X Empire X Empire is a popular Telegram-based clicker game inspired by Elon Musk, where players earn tokens by tapping on their screens. The game allows players to develop and upgrade virtual versions of the hectobillionaire. It rebranded from Musk Empire to X Empire in September 2024 to distinguish itself from Musk-related content while expanding the game's features and gameplay. In October 2024, X Empire had almost 50 million players and integrated over 18.5 million TON wallets, as several crypto media sources reported. The T2E model has helped it attract a loyal player base. The main goal of the game, which stands out through its focus on community rewards and strategic gameplay, is to accumulate coins by tapping on the screen. Players can choose to upgrade their Musk avatar, enhancing their earning potential. They avail of passive earnings for up to three hours, facilitating growth while taking a break from the game. They can invite friends and earn more rewards by rising to more significant in-game challenges. Daily competitions and quests provide additional earning opportunities through investments and tasks within X Empire's stock exchange. X Empire strives for sustainability and long-term growth. It features strategic depth, which appeals to people with an affinity for Web3 technologies who want to take part in gameplay with digital economy elements. While the game is free, the platform reliably rewards those who have invested in it. Unfortunately, X Empire's site uses concealed WHOIS data, which makes it hard to verify the owner, raising concerns about its transparency. Funtico's Lucky Funatic Funtico , the platform behind the T2E game Lucky Funatic, is establishing itself as the golden standard for gamer-focused Web3 projects. Players own their game assets and items, which are sold in the Funtico marketplace. The upcoming Telegram-based app is implementing highly engaging mechanics in its effort to surpass leading games like Notcoin and Hamster Kombat. It provides experiences such as collectible cards, passive income generation, and quest milestones. Funtico aims to establish itself as a gaming and entertainment hub, providing different studios and developers with opportunities to publish their games. Lucky Funatic focuses on earning FUNZ tokens, in-game ranks, and unlocking level-ups to make progress. Players climb ranks and use FUNZ to buy power-ups that help them gain even more rewards. The platform's Telegram and Discord channels have 28,271 and 23,244 members, respectively, as well as 2,000 followers on LinkedIn. Lucky Funatic boasts almost 400,000 active monthly players. Getting started with T2E Beginners should start with one or two games to understand the gameplay mechanics and join social media groups or forums related to those games. Players share tips and strategies in forums, which can be extremely helpful for a novice. Setting limits on playing time is encouraged to avoid burnout, as is visiting the official site regularly to check for developer announcements, new features, updates, or events that could affect the gameplay experience. Most critically, T2E novices should make sure they understand the risks of investing money into any game. How to identify less-than-stellar projects If the project asks for upfront payment, it's a sure sign of a scam. Legitimate projects never require payment. The odds are against any player who is asked to invest funds during or after the mining stage. The games presented here do not require anyone to pay upfront to start playing. Instead, they focus on a free-to-play, P2E model. Finally, some projects try to gamify participation by throwing excessive tasks at players. The tasks deplete the latter's time and effort rather than enabling them to accumulate value. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Kusama issued the statement in response to Shiba Inu enthusiasts who emphasized that burns are crucial to driving SHIB‚Äôs demand.¬†Community Reacts as 1 Cent Dream Burns 250M SHIB¬†For context, the exchange started after the 1 Cent Dream's official X handle announced its second Shiba Inu burn campaign, featuring the incineration of 250 million SHIB.¬†https://twitter.com/1cDream/status/18651022170336831241 Cent urged the Shiba Inu community to support its project to remove more SHIB tokens from circulation. In response, some users instead criticized Kusama for not significantly enhancing SHIB burns.¬†Notably, a community member with the pseudonym Gunz0369 emphasized that burns are necessary to attract new investors. The user noted that this move might help propel Shiba Inu into the future.¬†Kusama Refutes Claim, Highlights Factors Driving SHIB Success¬†Reacting, Kusama pointed out the inconsistency in the claim. According to him, while critics argue that burns are relevant in attracting investors to the ecosystem, they also claim that there are not enough burns.¬†He characterized the claims as false, referencing Shiba Inu‚Äôs spectacular performance this year despite limited burns. For context, the price of Shiba Inu has witnessed a year-to-date (YTD) surge of 192% to $0.00003035.¬†The Shiba Inu leader suggested that Shiba Inu‚Äôs growth is not entirely reliant on burn but other factors. They include increased utility, partnerships, and a complete ecosystem featuring the Shibarium blockchain.¬†Instead of focusing solely on burns, Kusama emphasized utilizing a holistic strategy featuring utility, governance, and influence to impact SHIB‚Äôs success.¬†According to Kusama, key partnerships within the Shiba Inu ecosystem and revenue will increase burns and positive sentiment in the long term.¬†Furthermore, the Shiba Inu lead suggested that increasing utility and completing more projects to attract new users to the ecosystem are the perfect ways to enhance burns. ‚ÄúFinally, and again, Shib is going well. And it isn't because we burnt an enormous amount of Shib, ONLY, it's because WE ARE SHIB. ZOOM OUT,‚Äù he added .¬†Shiba Inu Success Cannot be Tied to Only Shibarium¬†Meanwhile, some community members downplayed Shibarium's role in reducing SHIB‚Äôs supply. Specifically, a user questioned how Shibarium has impacted SHIB burns despite being labeled the ‚Äògame changer.‚ÄôResponding, Kusama emphasized that the price of SHIB has soared 3x since Shibarium launched on the mainnet. However, another user alleged that SHIB‚Äôs incredible performance was not driven by Shibarium, adding that the L2 blockchain requires SHIB to be successful, not the other way around.¬†Interestingly, Kusama used McDonald‚Äôs success as an analogy to explain why SHIB‚Äôs growth cannot be attributed to a single factor like Shibarium. The Shiba Inu leader suggested that just like McDonald‚Äôs success cannot be attributed to its fries alone, SHIB‚Äôs growth cannot be tied to only Shibarium.¬†He asserted that the success is driven by a total package, ranging from marketing to location.¬†It bears mentioning that Shibarium has facilitated the incineration of over 56 billion SHIB since its launch last year. The team manually burned these tokens using a portion of Shibarium gas fees. Following the launch of the burn portal, the system has automatically removed over 300 million SHIB from the circulating supply.¬†In the meantime, over 410.74 trillion SHIB tokens have gone up in flames since Shiba Inu launched on August 1, 2020.",NEUTRAL,SHIB,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/09/shiba-inu-lead-addresses-misconceptions-about-the-role-of-burns-to-shib-success/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=shiba-inu-lead-addresses-misconceptions-about-the-role-of-burns-to-shib-success,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Indeed, such an assessment was proven correct in early December as the cryptocurrency stopped its surge shortly after breaking above $2.80 and almost crashed to $2.20 before stabilizing. XRP 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold Despite the original bull run appearing over for the time being, the on-chain analyst and digital assets expert, Ali Martinez, explained on X that he believes the long-term trends and associated analyses still favor a continued ‚Äì and, eventually, even greater ‚Äì rally for XRP. Crypto expert sets $48 as the XRP price target Specifically, Martinez directly countered the idea that XRP was truly overbought as the token‚Äôs long-term chart reveals that the November surge constituted an important breakout from a ‚Äòmassive‚Äô multi-year symmetrical triangle. A symmetrical triangle is a chart pattern in which the support trend line connects the lower highs, the resistance trend line is drawn using the higher lows, and the two ultimately converge in an equal slope. Though the pattern itself shows the continuation of a trend and can lead to a shift in either direction, XRP‚Äôs move from $0.5 in early November to $2.37 at press time on December 9 demonstrates a decisive bullish breakout. Finally, along with estimating that the token is not only overbought but, arguably, remains undervalued, the expert also provided two price targets they deem likely for the cryptocurrency. According to the expert, XRP is bound for a rally to $8.40, which he described as a highly plausible estimate. Furthermore, thanks to the current setup, the token might also go as high as $48.12 ‚Äì a 1,888.43% upside. Furthermore, the forecast may be coming to fruition already at press time, as the very same cryptocurrency analyst pointed out on December 9 that the token has had three consecutive bull pennants. They also added in their X post that the ideal scenario would be a correction to $2.25 to ‚Äòbuy the dip‚Äô with the immediate next target standing at $4.40. Why XRP will likely regain old highs in 2025 Moving beyond the technical setup and price history, a continued rally for XRP in 2025 appears likely. The token is associated with one of the biggest companies in the sector ‚Äì Ripple Labs ‚Äì and, despite its continued popularity, its value has been depressed by the ongoing legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for years. The latest rally followed a string of direct and vicarious victories: Ripple made substantial gains in the courtroom, Donald Trump ‚Äì seen as far more crypto-friendly than either Joe Biden or Kamala Harris ‚Äì was re-elected, and Gary Gensler confirmed he would be resigning as SEC Chair on January 20. Considering that the factors that enabled the rally in November remain in play and that a period of consolidation is commonly seen after significant rallies, Martinez‚Äôs optimistic forecast appears more than plausible. Still, one possible cause for pessimism might be that XRP owed much of its popularity to Ripple‚Äôs dogged defense against the SEC ‚Äì seen as taking a stand on behalf of the entire cryptocurrency industry ‚Äì and its staying power to the many investors who purchased at the 2018 and 2022 highs and were, until the most recent rally, overwhelmingly in the red.

This came out during an interview with Big Pey, a Cardano-focused YouTube channel, where he talked about meetings with Ripple execs Brad Garlinghouse and David Schwartz. After years of being at each other‚Äôs throats, the two camps might finally be working together. RLUSD, which is set to launch on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum after approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), could eventually be deployed on Cardano. Here's my interview with @bigpeyYT https://t.co/ZB1slJNaju ‚Äî Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 8, 2024 RLUSD and Cardano‚Äôs potential Charles wants RLUSD to find a home on Midnight, a privacy-focused sidechain within the Cardano network. Midnight runs on a dual-token model with NIGHT for transactions and DUST for governance and staking. Charles envisions RLUSD becoming an alternative currency on the sidechain, alongside XRP . ‚ÄúIt makes sense to bring XRP into the Midnight story,‚Äù he said, adding that RLUSD could strengthen the privacy and functionality of Midnight‚Äôs ecosystem. Charles believes RLUSD and XRP would enhance its appeal to developers and users alike. Midnight‚Äôs dual-token system already covers transactions and governance, but RLUSD could bring stability to its financial infrastructure. Marlowe, Cardano‚Äôs open-source toolkit for creating smart contracts, might also play a role in this collaboration. Charles suggested that XRP and RLUSD could benefit more from Marlowe than Cardano‚Äôs native ADA token ever has. According to him, its tools align perfectly with the functionality Ripple‚Äôs ecosystem requires. Charles pointed out that RLUSD could expand its use cases through Marlowe‚Äôs features, making it a more versatile asset. He called the integration ‚Äúa no-brainer.‚Äù A history of beef Charles and Ripple‚Äôs community haven‚Äôt exactly been best friends. In fact, he‚Äôs gone as far as calling XRP supporters ‚Äútrolls‚Äù in the past. The Ripple vs. SEC legal drama only made things worse, with Charles taking jabs at Ripple‚Äôs fans during the height of the case. But last month, something changed. As we reported , Charles issued a public apology to the XRP community, admitting that the crypto industry‚Äôs infighting was counterproductive. ‚ÄúWe all need to move forward,‚Äù he said. This opened the door to a more constructive relationship, leading to his recent discussions with Ripple‚Äôs leadership. Let‚Äôs not forget who we‚Äôre dealing with here. Charles is no stranger to drama. His early days at Ethereum ended with a bitter split from Vitalik Buterin over governance. Charles wanted Ethereum to go for-profit, while Vitalik insisted on a non-profit model. The fallout led Charles to create Cardano , which he marketed as a superior blockchain with decentralized governance. He‚Äôs spent years criticizing Ethereum, calling its governance a ‚Äúdictatorship‚Äù under Vitalik‚Äôs control. But now, Charles wants to see an end to what he‚Äôs called ‚Äúpetty tribalism‚Äù in crypto. ‚ÄúWe have a window to grow this market into the trillions,‚Äù he said.

The star token has been constantly testing the highs above $100K but is closing the day‚Äôs trade below the range. This could have raised the uncertainty over the token and, as a result, the selling pressure has been rising since the early trading hours. A leading indicator has just turned bearish and a continuation towards the lower targets may delay the bullish continuation for a while. The recent price action suggests a drop in the bullish strength as the buying volume also fades. Does this indicate the end of the Bitcoin bull run is close enough? Is the token in the last phase of the bullish cycle? The BTC price has been trading sideways over the past few days and is unable to sustain the price above the pivotal range. After a breakout from the range, the price is testing the resistance-turned-support zone. While the possibility of a rebound after the ongoing retracement is pretty high, but only be if the token sustains above one of the pivotal support zones. With a drop in the volume from the highs above $150 billion, the token‚Äôs volatility has also declined to a large extent. Besides, the bands of Bollinger are going parallel with each other, suggesting the price to maintain a sluggish behaviour for some more time as the altcoins are surging with a rise in their dominance. Secondly, the RSI has displayed a bearish divergence, which validates the bearish trajectory. The short-term price action suggests a drop as the momentum forms lower highs while the price forms higher highs. Hence, even if the markets rally sideways for days or while being within the overbought zone, the caution of the local correction remains high. Therefore, the BTC price is feared to drop below the zone as the upward pressure escalates. Meanwhile, some on-chain readings support the bullish narrative, hinting towards a rebound shortly. The above chart shows that the BTC illiquid supply is on the rise, meaning more Bitcoin is being held long-term while less is on exchanges. When demand increases, a limited supply on exchanges can drive the prices higher. Therefore, more exciting price action is expected for Bitcoin ahead of the yearly close but the drop in volatility may be a matter of concern at the moment.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-displaying-a-bearish-divergence-is-this-a-matter-of-concern-for-the-btc-price-rally/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

According to cybersecurity firm Cado Security Labs, the malware, dubbed Realst, has been active for around four months, targeting cryptocurrency wallets, browser-stored credentials, banking card details, and hardware wallet information disguised as a fake meeting application. The stealthy malware, which can infiltrate both Windows and Mac operating systems, is distributed via AI-generated websites designed to look like a genuine platform, complete with fabricated product reviews, blog posts, and social media accounts to enhance their credibility. Researchers warned that scammers are ‚Äúincreasingly using AI to generate content for their campaigns,‚Äù which allows them to easily create ‚Äúrealistic website content,‚Äù making it difficult to spot the scams.

In a new interview on Yahoo! Finance, Saylor says Bitcoin is emerging as the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs reserve capital network.‚Äù ‚ÄúPeople are realizing that Bitcoin is better than real estate, it‚Äôs better than stocks. There‚Äôs not a single company or real estate property that you would rather own for the long term than Bitcoin.‚Äù Saylor, whose company owns the largest corporate holding of Bitcoin in the world, says the US should attempt to control up to a quarter of the entire Bitcoin network, and then force the price of gold down by unloading all its precious metal holdings. Once gold is ‚Äúdemonetized,‚Äù Saylor says other countries will be forced to acquire BTC, sending their money into the United States via the BTC network, tilting the world financial chessboard back in favor of the US. ‚ÄúSo the very simple idea is to buy 20 or 25% of the Bitcoin network on behalf of the US government, catalyze the development of that world reserve capital network, and then let all the Chinese and the Russians and foreigners sell all their other assets and buy Bitcoin and then the money flows into the United States. If you want to put a great twist on it, dump your gold, sell all the US gold, buy Bitcoin. Then the trade is free because you could buy five million Bitcoin for the cost of the gold. You will demonetize the entire gold asset class and our enemies hold gold in their banks, so their assets would go to zero, our assets would go to a hundred trillion dollars and we would control the world‚Äôs reserve capital network as well as the world‚Äôs reserve currency network.‚Äù Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

37418931,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108373,1733739330,BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT Buys $2.6 Billion in Bitcoin Last Week: A Landmark Move for Institutional Adoption,"In a monumental development within the cryptocurrency landscape, BlackRock‚Äôs spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has made headlines by purchasing a staggering $2.6 billion worth of Bitcoin over the past week. This impressive acquisition translates to an average daily purchase of approximately half a billion dollars . Reported by the crypto intelligence platform Arkham on X (formerly Twitter), this move not only underscores BlackRock‚Äôs growing commitment to digital assets but also signals a significant boost for Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional adoption and market dynamics. Understanding BlackRock and Its Influence in the Financial World Who is BlackRock? BlackRock, Inc. stands as one of the world‚Äôs largest and most influential asset management firms. Founded in 1988 by Larry Fink and a group of partners, BlackRock has grown exponentially, managing trillions of dollars in assets across a diverse range of investment vehicles. With its extensive global presence and deep expertise in financial markets, BlackRock plays a pivotal role in shaping investment trends and financial strategies worldwide. The Significance of a Spot Bitcoin ETF An Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is a type of investment fund that is traded on stock exchanges, much like individual stocks. ETFs typically track an index, commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets. A spot Bitcoin ETF , in particular, directly holds Bitcoin as its underlying asset, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the need to purchase and store the cryptocurrency themselves. This contrasts with futures-based Bitcoin ETFs , which derive their value from Bitcoin futures contracts rather than the cryptocurrency itself. Spot ETFs provide a more direct and transparent investment vehicle, closely mirroring the actual price movements of Bitcoin. BlackRock‚Äôs Entry into the Bitcoin ETF Space BlackRock‚Äôs introduction of the IBIT (BlackRock Bitcoin Trust ETF) represents a strategic foray into the cryptocurrency market. By launching a spot Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock is catering to institutional and retail investors seeking straightforward and secure ways to invest in Bitcoin. This move aligns with the broader trend of traditional financial institutions embracing digital assets, signaling a shift towards greater integration between conventional finance and the burgeoning crypto ecosystem. Arkham‚Äôs Reporting: Unveiling the Massive Purchase Who is Arkham? Arkham is a leading crypto intelligence platform known for its in-depth analysis, tracking, and reporting of significant movements within the cryptocurrency markets. By leveraging advanced data analytics and real-time tracking, Arkham provides valuable insights into institutional investments, market trends, and blockchain activities. Details of the Purchase According to Arkham‚Äôs recent post on X, BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT has acquired $2.6 billion worth of Bitcoin within a single week. Breaking down this figure, it averages to about $500 million in daily purchases . This level of investment is unprecedented for a single entity within such a short timeframe, highlighting BlackRock‚Äôs aggressive strategy in capitalizing on Bitcoin‚Äôs growth potential. The Implications of BlackRock‚Äôs Massive Bitcoin Purchase Boosting Bitcoin‚Äôs Legitimacy and Market Sentiment BlackRock‚Äôs substantial investment in Bitcoin serves as a powerful endorsement of the cryptocurrency‚Äôs viability as a mainstream asset. Institutional investments are often seen as a barometer of an asset‚Äôs stability and potential for long-term growth. By allocating billions into Bitcoin, BlackRock not only bolsters investor confidence but also encourages other institutional players to consider similar investments. Impact on Bitcoin‚Äôs Price and Market Dynamics Large-scale purchases by influential entities like BlackRock can have significant effects on Bitcoin‚Äôs price and overall market dynamics: Price Appreciation: The infusion of $2.6 billion into Bitcoin can drive its price higher due to increased demand, especially if the market perceives this move as a bullish indicator. Increased Liquidity: Higher institutional participation enhances Bitcoin‚Äôs liquidity, making it easier for investors to enter and exit positions without causing drastic price swings. Market Stability: Institutional investments can contribute to market stability by providing sustained demand, potentially reducing extreme volatility that often characterizes the crypto markets. Encouraging Wider Institutional Adoption BlackRock‚Äôs aggressive investment strategy sets a precedent for other large financial institutions. As one of the most trusted and influential asset managers globally, BlackRock‚Äôs endorsement can pave the way for broader institutional adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This trend can lead to the development of more sophisticated financial products, increased regulatory clarity, and a more integrated financial ecosystem that bridges traditional finance and digital assets. The Strategic Rationale Behind BlackRock‚Äôs Investment Hedging Against Inflation and Currency Depreciation In the current economic climate, characterized by rising inflation rates and concerns over fiat currency depreciation, Bitcoin offers a compelling hedge. Its limited supply (capped at 21 million coins) and decentralized nature make it resistant to inflationary pressures and government manipulation. By investing in Bitcoin, BlackRock is positioning itself to protect its assets against the eroding value of traditional currencies. Diversification of Asset Portfolios Diversification is a fundamental investment strategy aimed at spreading risk across various asset classes. Incorporating Bitcoin into BlackRock‚Äôs portfolio allows for exposure to a unique asset with different risk-return profiles compared to traditional investments like stocks, bonds, and real estate. This diversification can enhance overall portfolio performance and reduce volatility. Capitalizing on Bitcoin‚Äôs Growth Potential Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable growth since its inception, with significant price appreciation driven by increasing adoption, technological advancements, and institutional interest. BlackRock‚Äôs investment in Bitcoin is a strategic move to capitalize on this growth trajectory, anticipating that Bitcoin will continue to appreciate as it gains broader acceptance and integration into the global financial system. Regulatory Considerations and Compliance Navigating the Complex Regulatory Landscape The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies remains complex and varies significantly across jurisdictions. BlackRock, with its extensive experience in navigating regulatory frameworks, is well-positioned to manage the compliance challenges associated with a spot Bitcoin ETF. This involves adhering to anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) regulations, ensuring transparency, and maintaining robust security measures to protect investor assets. Impact of Regulatory Developments on Institutional Investments Positive regulatory developments, such as the approval of Bitcoin ETFs and clear guidelines for cryptocurrency investments, can enhance institutional confidence and drive further investments. Conversely, stringent regulations or outright bans can hinder institutional participation and negatively impact the market. BlackRock‚Äôs strategic investments are likely influenced by ongoing regulatory dialogues and the anticipation of favorable regulatory outcomes that support cryptocurrency adoption. Technological Infrastructure and Security Measures Ensuring Secure Storage of Bitcoin Assets Managing and securing Bitcoin holdings require advanced technological infrastructure and stringent security protocols. BlackRock employs state-of-the-art cold storage solutions, multi-signature wallets, and robust cybersecurity measures to protect its Bitcoin assets from theft, hacking, and other security threats. These measures ensure the integrity and safety of the investments, providing peace of mind to both the firm and its investors. Leveraging Blockchain Technology for Transparency Blockchain technology offers unparalleled transparency and traceability, which are crucial for institutional investors. BlackRock utilizes blockchain‚Äôs immutable ledger to maintain transparent records of its Bitcoin transactions, ensuring accountability and facilitating regulatory compliance. This transparency enhances trust and credibility among stakeholders, reinforcing BlackRock‚Äôs reputation as a responsible and forward-thinking asset manager. The Broader Impact on the Cryptocurrency Ecosystem Stimulating Innovation and Development BlackRock‚Äôs substantial investment in Bitcoin can stimulate further innovation within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Increased institutional involvement often leads to the development of more advanced financial products, improved trading platforms, and enhanced security protocols. This innovation can drive the evolution of the cryptocurrency market, making it more efficient, secure, and accessible to a broader range of investors. Encouraging the Growth of Ancillary Services The influx of institutional capital into Bitcoin can spur the growth of ancillary services such as custodial solutions, blockchain analytics, and financial advisory services tailored to cryptocurrency investments. These services are essential for supporting the needs of large investors, ensuring the smooth integration of digital assets into traditional financial systems. Enhancing Global Adoption of Bitcoin BlackRock‚Äôs investment signals a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class on a global scale. As more institutions recognize the value and potential of Bitcoin, its adoption can accelerate, leading to increased usage in various financial applications, greater integration with traditional financial services, and enhanced acceptance by regulatory bodies worldwide. Potential Challenges and Risks Market Volatility and Price Fluctuations While Bitcoin offers significant growth potential, its price volatility remains a critical concern. Large-scale investments can drive price spikes, but they also expose investors to the risk of sudden downturns. BlackRock must implement effective risk management strategies to mitigate the impact of Bitcoin‚Äôs inherent volatility on its portfolio. Regulatory Risks and Uncertainty The evolving regulatory landscape poses ongoing risks for institutional Bitcoin investments. Changes in regulations, such as increased scrutiny or restrictive policies, can impact Bitcoin‚Äôs legality, trading mechanisms, and overall market sentiment. BlackRock must remain agile and responsive to regulatory developments to navigate these uncertainties effectively. Technological Vulnerabilities Despite robust security measures, Bitcoin and blockchain technologies are not immune to vulnerabilities. Potential threats include hacking, fraud, and technical failures that could compromise asset security and operational integrity. Continuous investment in cybersecurity and technological advancements is essential to safeguard Bitcoin holdings and maintain investor trust. Market Saturation and Diminishing Returns As more institutional players enter the Bitcoin market, the potential for diminishing returns exists. Increased competition for limited Bitcoin supply can drive up prices, reducing the potential for significant gains. Additionally, market saturation can lead to reduced liquidity, making it challenging to execute large trades without impacting prices. Strategic Recommendations for Amazon and Other Corporations Consideration of a Diversified Crypto Strategy Instead of allocating the entirety of reserves to Bitcoin, corporations like Amazon could adopt a diversified crypto strategy that includes a mix of digital assets. This approach mitigates risks associated with individual asset volatility and capitalizes on the unique strengths of various cryptocurrencies. Implementation of Robust Risk Management Frameworks Developing comprehensive risk management frameworks is crucial for navigating the high volatility of cryptocurrency investments. Strategies such as hedging, position sizing, and setting clear investment limits can help manage potential losses and protect overall portfolio health. Engagement with Regulatory Bodies Proactive engagement with regulatory bodies is essential for shaping favorable policies and ensuring compliance. Corporations should collaborate with policymakers to advocate for clear and supportive regulatory frameworks that facilitate institutional cryptocurrency investments while safeguarding market integrity. Investment in Technological Infrastructure Building and maintaining advanced technological infrastructure is paramount for managing cryptocurrency investments effectively. Investing in secure storage solutions, blockchain analytics, and real-time monitoring systems enhances operational efficiency and asset security. Focus on Long-Term Value and Sustainability Adopting a long-term investment perspective allows corporations to weather short-term volatility and capitalize on Bitcoin‚Äôs potential for substantial appreciation over time. Emphasizing sustainability and responsible investment practices ensures that crypto strategies align with broader financial goals and risk tolerance levels. Conclusion BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT purchasing $2.6 billion in Bitcoin within a single week marks a watershed moment for institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. This strategic investment not only underscores BlackRock‚Äôs confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs potential as a store of value and inflation hedge but also sets a powerful precedent for other major financial institutions to follow suit. As one of the most influential asset managers globally, BlackRock‚Äôs foray into Bitcoin investment signifies a broader acceptance and integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. The implications of this move are profound, impacting Bitcoin‚Äôs price dynamics, enhancing market liquidity, and fostering greater institutional confidence in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. However, this bold strategy is not without its challenges, including managing volatility, navigating regulatory uncertainties, and ensuring robust technological security. For corporations like Amazon, the decision to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy requires careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks. By implementing diversified investment approaches, robust risk management frameworks, and engaging proactively with regulatory bodies, companies can effectively harness the advantages of Bitcoin while mitigating associated risks. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, institutional investments by titans like BlackRock will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of digital finance. These investments drive innovation, enhance market stability, and pave the way for broader adoption, ultimately contributing to the maturation and mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. In this transformative era, staying informed, strategic planning, and embracing technological advancements will be key for investors and corporations alike to navigate the complexities of the cryptocurrency landscape and capitalize on its vast potential.

However, the scam quickly unraveled as the community identified and exposed the fraud, leading to a dramatic 99% price crash for ADA/SOL. The attack didn‚Äôt end there. The hackers further amplified the damage by posting a fabricated update, falsely claiming the Cardano Foundation would halt support for its native ADA token due to the ongoing SEC lawsuit and that ADA withdrawals were suspended. This coordinated misinformation campaign, despite rapid efforts to remove the false announcements, significantly impacted investor sentiment. Months of positive market outlook for Cardano evaporated, replaced by uncertainty and fear fueled by the ongoing compromise of the official X account.

Technical indicators show ADA‚Äôs macro momentum has switched downward. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence displays a bearish wave as the MACD line moved beneath the signal line over the weekend. That suggests potential near-term price dips for Cardano. A downside MACD crossover amid weak trading volumes often precedes bearish price actions. Moreover, ADA lacks massive bullish signals at prevailing levels. The alt requires significant momentum resurgence to challenge the nearest resistance zones. The current outlook signals potential struggles for Cardano unless bulls dominate the broader market. Buyer uptick would see the token targeting the resistance at $1.20. A successful flip of this hurdle into footing could open the path to $1.32. Meanwhile, such an uptrend would necessitate immense bull activity, robust trading volumes, and enhanced sentiments. Meanwhile, seller dominance could trigger a significant bearish wave to the vital support barrier at $1.01. A rebound from this support amidst negative sentiments, possibly catalyzed by the hacking incidents, could keep ADA range-bound. Nonetheless, overcoming $1.32 with massive volumes could cancel the downside narrative. That would confirm renewed momentum for ADA, possibly attracting more buyers to the Cardano ecosystem.

37418824,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108269,1733739086,Polish Authorities Arrest Former WEX CEO Dmitry V. on U.S. Extradition Request,"In a landmark case within the cryptocurrency industry, Polish authorities have arrested Dmitry V., the former CEO of the Russia-based crypto exchange WEX , following an extradition request from the U.S. Department of Justice. This arrest underscores the escalating efforts by international law enforcement to clamp down on financial crimes in the digital currency space, particularly those involving fraudulent activities and money laundering. The Arrest of Dmitry V.: A Detailed Overview On December 9, 2024, central Warsaw witnessed the apprehension of Dmitry V., a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency exchange sector. Dmitry V. previously led WEX, the successor to the infamous BTC-e Exchange, which collapsed in 2018 amid allegations of extensive fraud and money laundering. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has been actively pursuing Dmitry V. for his alleged involvement in these illicit activities, and his recent arrest by Polish authorities marks a significant advancement towards his extradition and subsequent prosecution. Background of WEX and BTC-e Exchange To fully comprehend the significance of this arrest, it is essential to explore the histories of WEX and its predecessor, BTC-e Exchange. BTC-e was established as a cryptocurrency exchange platform that quickly gained traction due to its user-friendly interface and a wide array of supported digital currencies. However, beneath its legitimate operations, BTC-e was entangled in numerous controversies. In 2017, U.S. authorities charged BTC-e and Dmitry V. with facilitating substantial money laundering activities, including handling proceeds from the notorious Mt. Gox heist and other cybercrimes. The exchange was accused of laundering billions of dollars in illicit funds, making it a prime target for international law enforcement agencies. Following the collapse of BTC-e in 2018, WEX emerged as its successor, inheriting not only the user base but also the legal troubles associated with its predecessor. Despite efforts to rebrand and restructure, WEX continued to face scrutiny over its financial practices, ultimately leading to the current extradition request from the U.S. Legal Proceedings and Extradition Process The extradition process is often intricate, involving multiple legal steps and international cooperation. In Dmitry V.‚Äôs case, the U.S. Department of Justice has been diligently seeking his extradition to face charges related to fraud and money laundering. The arrest in Poland signifies that the necessary legal frameworks and agreements between the U.S. and Poland have been activated to facilitate this process. Poland, as a member of the European Union, adheres to stringent extradition treaties that ensure the efficient transfer of individuals accused of serious crimes to the requesting countries. The extradition request likely involved comprehensive legal documentation outlining the charges, evidence, and the necessity of Dmitry V.‚Äôs presence in the U.S. legal system. Implications for the Cryptocurrency Industry The arrest of a former CEO of a major crypto exchange on such serious charges has profound implications for the cryptocurrency industry. It highlights the increasing attention regulatory bodies are placing on digital currencies and the platforms that facilitate their trading. As cryptocurrencies continue to gain mainstream acceptance, the necessity for robust regulatory frameworks becomes paramount to prevent misuse and ensure the integrity of financial systems. Enhanced Regulatory Scrutiny This case exemplifies the tightening regulatory environment surrounding crypto exchanges. Authorities are now more vigilant in monitoring these platforms to prevent fraud, money laundering, and other illicit activities. Exchanges are likely to face more stringent compliance requirements, including Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols. Impact on Crypto Exchange Operations Crypto exchanges may need to reassess their operational frameworks to align with evolving regulations. This could involve implementing more transparent financial practices, enhancing security measures, and ensuring that all transactions comply with international laws. Investor Confidence While regulatory actions might initially cause apprehension among investors, they ultimately contribute to building trust in the cryptocurrency market. Knowing that there are active measures to combat fraud and protect investments can enhance investor confidence in the long term. The Role of International Cooperation in Combating Financial Crimes The successful arrest and potential extradition of Dmitry V. highlight the critical role of international cooperation in tackling financial crimes within the cryptocurrency sector. As digital currencies transcend national borders, so do the challenges associated with regulating and overseeing them. Collaborative efforts between countries are essential to ensure that perpetrators cannot easily evade justice by exploiting jurisdictional loopholes. Information Sharing Effective information sharing between international law enforcement agencies is vital. In Dmitry V.‚Äôs case, the cooperation between the U.S. Department of Justice and Polish authorities enabled the swift execution of the arrest. Unified Legal Standards Harmonizing legal standards across countries can streamline the extradition process and ensure that there is a consistent approach to handling financial crimes related to cryptocurrencies. Joint Investigations Collaborative investigations allow for the pooling of resources and expertise, making it easier to trace complex financial transactions and gather the necessary evidence to prosecute high-profile individuals involved in fraud and money laundering. Potential Outcomes and Future Developments As Dmitry V. awaits extradition, several potential outcomes and future developments could shape the landscape of the cryptocurrency industry: Extradition and Prosecution If extradited, Dmitry V. will face trial in the U.S., where he could be convicted on charges of fraud and money laundering. A conviction could result in a lengthy prison sentence, serving as a deterrent to others in the industry. Precedent for Future Cases This case may set a legal precedent for how similar cases are handled in the future. It signals to crypto executives that international law enforcement is serious about prosecuting financial crimes, potentially leading to greater compliance and ethical standards within the industry. Regulatory Enhancements In response to high-profile cases like this, regulatory bodies may introduce more comprehensive regulations to oversee cryptocurrency exchanges, ensuring greater transparency and accountability. Market Reaction The cryptocurrency market may experience fluctuations in response to such arrests, with investors reacting to the heightened regulatory environment. However, over time, these measures are likely to contribute to a more stable and trustworthy market. Dmitry V.‚Äôs Legal Defense and Responses While the arrest marks a significant development, Dmitry V. and his legal team are expected to mount a robust defense against the extradition request. Potential defenses may include challenging the legality of the extradition process, questioning the sufficiency of the evidence, or asserting that the charges are politically motivated. Legal Arguments Dmitry V. may argue that his rights under Polish and international law are being infringed upon, or that the U.S. lacks jurisdiction over certain aspects of his alleged activities. Public Statements Public statements and press releases from Dmitry V. and his associates may attempt to sway public opinion or cast doubt on the legitimacy of the charges. The legal battle is likely to be closely watched by both the crypto community and the general public. Impact on Reputation Regardless of the legal outcome, the arrest has undoubtedly impacted Dmitry V.‚Äôs reputation and that of WEX. The association with fraud and money laundering charges can have long-term consequences for his career and any future ventures he may undertake. The Broader Context of Crypto Regulation The arrest of Dmitry V. is part of a broader trend of increased regulatory scrutiny in the cryptocurrency sector. Governments and regulatory bodies around the world are grappling with how to effectively oversee and regulate digital currencies to prevent misuse while fostering innovation. Global Regulatory Landscape Different countries are adopting varying approaches to crypto regulation. Some, like the United States, are moving towards more stringent oversight, while others may adopt more lenient or innovative regulatory frameworks to attract crypto businesses. Technological Advancements Advancements in blockchain technology and digital security are both a boon and a challenge for regulators. While blockchain offers transparency and traceability, it also presents new avenues for financial crimes that require sophisticated monitoring and enforcement strategies. Industry Adaptation Crypto exchanges and other industry players are adapting by enhancing their compliance measures, investing in security technologies, and engaging with regulators to shape favorable regulatory environments. The Future of WEX and Its Users With the arrest of its former CEO, WEX faces an uncertain future. The company may undergo significant restructuring to address the legal challenges and restore trust among its user base. Key considerations include: Operational Overhaul WEX might implement comprehensive changes to its operational practices, including enhanced KYC and AML protocols, to comply with regulatory requirements and prevent future legal issues. User Confidence Maintaining and rebuilding user confidence will be crucial. Transparent communication about the steps being taken to ensure the platform‚Äôs integrity can help retain and attract users. Potential Acquisition or Merger In some cases, exchanges facing legal and reputational challenges may seek acquisition or merger opportunities to stabilize their operations and leverage the strengths of a more established entity. Expert Opinions on the Arrest Industry experts have weighed in on the arrest of Dmitry V., offering insights into its implications for the cryptocurrency sector: Regulatory Experts Regulators view the arrest as a necessary step to enforce compliance and deter financial crimes. They emphasize the importance of international cooperation in achieving these goals. Crypto Analysts Crypto analysts suggest that while such arrests may cause short-term market volatility, they ultimately contribute to a healthier and more regulated market environment, fostering long-term growth and stability. Legal Scholars Legal scholars highlight the complexities involved in extradition cases, especially those involving digital assets and international jurisdictions. They stress the need for clear legal frameworks to address these emerging challenges. Historical Context: WEX and Its Predecessor BTC-e To fully grasp the significance of Dmitry V.‚Äôs arrest, it‚Äôs essential to revisit the history of WEX and BTC-e, two platforms that have been at the center of major crypto controversies. BTC-e Exchange BTC-e was founded in 2011 and quickly became one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally. However, it became infamous for facilitating the laundering of funds from various cybercrimes, including the Mt. Gox hack, which saw the theft of approximately 850,000 Bitcoins. In 2017, the U.S. DOJ charged Dmitry V. and other executives with operating a vast money laundering operation through BTC-e. The exchange was subsequently shut down, and efforts to track down its key figures intensified. Transition to WEX Following BTC-e‚Äôs collapse, Dmitry V. launched WEX as its successor, aiming to continue serving the same user base while distancing the platform from the legal issues of its predecessor. Despite rebranding efforts, WEX struggled to escape the shadow of BTC-e‚Äôs notorious past. WEX faced multiple legal challenges and regulatory scrutiny, culminating in the current extradition request and the arrest of Dmitry V. The transition from BTC-e to WEX highlights the difficulties in reestablishing trust and legality in the aftermath of significant financial scandals. The Impact on Crypto Exchange Regulations The arrest of Dmitry V. has broader implications for how crypto exchanges are regulated globally. It serves as a case study for the necessary measures exchanges must implement to operate within legal boundaries. Enhanced Compliance Requirements Exchanges are now required to adhere to stricter compliance standards, including comprehensive KYC and AML procedures, regular audits, and transparent reporting mechanisms. Licensing and Accreditation Many jurisdictions are introducing licensing requirements for crypto exchanges, ensuring that only entities meeting specific standards can operate legally. This move aims to weed out fraudulent and non-compliant platforms from the market. Consumer Protection Measures Regulators are placing greater emphasis on consumer protection, ensuring that users‚Äô funds are secure and that they are informed about the risks associated with cryptocurrency trading. Lessons Learned and Best Practices The arrest of Dmitry V. provides valuable lessons for the cryptocurrency industry, emphasizing the importance of transparency, compliance, and ethical management. Transparency Crypto exchanges must maintain transparency in their operations, providing clear information about their financial practices, ownership structures, and compliance measures. Proactive Compliance Adopting proactive compliance strategies can help exchanges stay ahead of regulatory changes and avoid legal pitfalls. Regular training, audits, and updates to compliance protocols are essential. Ethical Leadership Strong, ethical leadership is crucial in fostering a culture of integrity within crypto organizations. Leaders must prioritize legal and ethical standards to ensure long-term success and trustworthiness. The Role of Technology in Preventing Financial Crimes Advancements in technology play a pivotal role in preventing financial crimes within the cryptocurrency sector. From blockchain analytics to artificial intelligence, various tools are being leveraged to enhance security and compliance. Blockchain Analytics Blockchain analytics tools enable the tracing of transactions across the blockchain, helping identify suspicious activities and linking them to illicit sources. These tools are invaluable for regulatory compliance and forensic investigations. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning AI and machine learning algorithms can analyze vast amounts of transaction data to detect patterns indicative of fraud, money laundering, and other financial crimes. These technologies enhance the ability of exchanges and regulators to identify and respond to threats in real-time. Enhanced Security Protocols Implementing advanced security measures, such as multi-factor authentication, encryption, and secure storage solutions, can protect user funds and sensitive information from cyber threats and unauthorized access. Community and Industry Response The crypto community and industry stakeholders have responded to the arrest of Dmitry V. with a mix of concern and support for increased regulation. Community Reactions Users and investors express concerns over the stability and legality of crypto exchanges. However, many also recognize the necessity of such regulatory actions to ensure the long-term viability of the industry. Industry Initiatives Crypto exchanges and related businesses are taking steps to improve their compliance frameworks and engage with regulators to shape favorable policies. Industry groups are advocating for balanced regulations that protect consumers without stifling innovation. Educational Efforts There is a growing emphasis on educating users about the importance of choosing regulated and reputable exchanges. Enhanced user awareness can lead to more informed decisions and safer investment practices. Conclusion The Polish arrests former WEX CEO Dmitry V. by Polish authorities on a U.S. extradition request marks a watershed moment in the cryptocurrency industry‚Äôs ongoing battle against financial crimes. This development not only underscores the critical need for robust regulatory frameworks and international cooperation but also serves as a cautionary tale for crypto executives and exchanges worldwide. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, the balance between innovation and regulation will remain paramount. Ensuring that digital currencies operate within legal boundaries is essential for fostering trust, protecting investors, and promoting sustainable growth in the industry. The case of Dmitry V. and WEX exemplifies the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead as the world grapples with the complexities of regulating a rapidly expanding and transformative financial ecosystem.

Enhanced platforms and user-friendly interfaces facilitate seamless investment experiences, attracting a broader investor base. Impact on Total Assets Under Management The $2.73 billion net inflow into spot BTC ETFs has significantly impacted the total assets under management (AUM) within the cryptocurrency ETF space. This influx has elevated the AUM to unprecedented levels, reflecting the growing trust and reliance on Bitcoin ETFs as a staple investment product. Growth Trajectory of Spot BTC ETFs Spot Bitcoin ETFs have exhibited exponential growth over the past few years, and the recent inflow further cements their position as a preferred investment instrument.

37418753,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108276,1733738881,South Korea‚Äôs Main Opposition Party to Abolish Capital Gains Tax on Investments as Planned,"In a significant policy shift aimed at stimulating the financial markets and attracting both domestic and international investments, South Korea‚Äôs main opposition party, the Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), plans to abolish capital gains tax on investments during the upcoming December 10 session. This move, slated to occur during the last regular session of the National Assembly for this year, underscores the DPK‚Äôs commitment to fostering a more investment-friendly environment and aligning with its economic reform agenda. Overview of the DPK‚Äôs Capital Gains Tax Abolition Plan The abolition of capital gains tax on investments represents a pivotal change in South Korea‚Äôs fiscal policy. Capital gains tax, which is levied on the profit from the sale of assets or investments, has long been a subject of debate among policymakers, investors, and the general public. By proposing to eliminate this tax, the DPK aims to reduce the tax burden on investors, thereby incentivizing more active participation in the financial markets. According to News Tomato, a DPK official confirmed that the party intends to follow through on its previous decisions regarding this policy change. The official emphasized that the abolition of capital gains tax is a cornerstone of the DPK‚Äôs economic strategy to enhance investment opportunities and drive economic growth. Legislative Process and Timeline The December 10 session marks the culmination of months of deliberation and negotiation within the National Assembly. The DPK has been actively working to build consensus among lawmakers to ensure the successful passage of the capital gains tax abolition bill. This legislative effort is part of the DPK‚Äôs broader agenda to implement comprehensive financial reforms aimed at modernizing South Korea‚Äôs economic landscape. Key Steps in the Legislative Process Drafting the Bill: The initial step involved drafting the legislation, which outlines the specific provisions for abolishing capital gains tax on various types of investments, including stocks, bonds, and real estate. Committee Review: The bill underwent rigorous scrutiny by relevant parliamentary committees, including the Finance Committee and the Judiciary Committee, to assess its feasibility, economic impact, and legal implications. Public Consultations: The DPK conducted public consultations to gather feedback from stakeholders, including investors, financial experts, and the general populace. This step ensured that the bill addresses the concerns and needs of all affected parties. Debates and Amendments: Lawmakers engaged in debates to discuss the merits and potential drawbacks of the proposed abolition. Amendments were proposed and incorporated to refine the bill and address any identified issues. Final Voting: The bill is now poised for final voting during the December 10 session, where it will be subject to approval by the majority of the National Assembly members. Statements from DPK Officials A DPK official, speaking to News Tomato, stated, ‚ÄúAbolishing capital gains tax on investments is essential for creating a more vibrant and dynamic investment environment in South Korea. This policy will not only alleviate the financial burden on investors but also attract significant foreign investments, contributing to our nation‚Äôs economic growth.‚Äù Furthermore, the official highlighted that this move aligns with the DPK‚Äôs commitment to economic reform and its broader vision of positioning South Korea as a leading global economy with robust financial markets. Support from Financial Leaders The DPK‚Äôs proposal has garnered support from various financial leaders and institutions, who view the abolition of capital gains tax as a positive step towards enhancing the competitiveness of South Korea‚Äôs financial markets. Lee Bok-hyun‚Äôs Endorsement In a related development, Lee Bok-hyun, the Governor of the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), has expressed strong support for the abolition of capital gains tax. According to Newsis, Lee emphasized his commitment to consistently advancing major policies, including the capital market advancement plan and the elimination of capital gains tax on financial investments. Lee stated, ‚ÄúEliminating capital gains tax on investments is a strategic move to strengthen our capital markets. It will encourage more investments, promote financial innovation, and ultimately lead to a more resilient and prosperous economy.‚Äù Implications for Investors and the Financial Market The planned abolition of capital gains tax on investments is poised to have far-reaching implications for both individual investors and the broader financial market in South Korea. Increased Investment Activity By removing the tax on capital gains, investors are likely to experience higher returns on their investments, which could lead to increased investment activity across various asset classes. This, in turn, may result in greater liquidity and depth in the financial markets, fostering a more robust investment environment. Attraction of Foreign Investments The elimination of capital gains tax can make South Korea a more attractive destination for foreign investors seeking favorable tax conditions. This influx of foreign capital could spur economic growth, create jobs, and enhance the overall competitiveness of South Korea‚Äôs financial markets on the global stage. Enhanced Portfolio Diversification Investors may find it more appealing to diversify their portfolios across different asset classes without the burden of capital gains tax, thereby optimizing their investment strategies and risk management practices. Economic Growth and Financial Stability The DPK‚Äôs initiative to abolish capital gains tax on investments is expected to contribute significantly to South Korea‚Äôs economic growth and financial stability. Stimulating Economic Growth Increased investment activity can lead to higher capital formation, which is essential for funding business expansions, innovation, and infrastructure projects. This, in turn, can drive economic growth and improve the overall standard of living. Promoting Financial Stability By encouraging a more active and diversified investment landscape, the abolition of capital gains tax can contribute to greater financial stability. A well-functioning financial market can better absorb shocks, reduce systemic risks, and support sustainable economic development. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the abolition of capital gains tax presents numerous benefits, it also comes with potential challenges that need to be carefully addressed to ensure its successful implementation. Revenue Implications for the Government Capital gains tax revenue constitutes a significant portion of the government‚Äôs income. Abolishing this tax could lead to a shortfall in revenue, necessitating alternative measures to offset the loss. The government may need to explore other tax reforms or budgetary adjustments to maintain fiscal balance. Market Speculation and Volatility The removal of capital gains tax might lead to increased speculation in the financial markets, potentially resulting in heightened volatility. Policymakers must implement measures to mitigate excessive speculation and ensure that investment activities remain aligned with long-term economic goals. Equity and Fairness Concerns Critics may argue that abolishing capital gains tax disproportionately benefits high-income individuals who are more likely to engage in investment activities. To address concerns of equity and fairness, the DPK may need to consider complementary policies that promote inclusive growth and ensure that the benefits of tax abolition are widely shared across different segments of society. Comparative Analysis: Capital Gains Tax Policies in Other Countries To contextualize South Korea‚Äôs proposed abolition of capital gains tax on investments, it is useful to examine how other countries approach this tax. United States In the United States, capital gains tax rates vary based on the holding period and the investor‚Äôs income level. Long-term capital gains, derived from assets held for more than a year, are taxed at preferential rates compared to short-term gains. This structure incentivizes long-term investment and portfolio diversification. United Kingdom The United Kingdom imposes capital gains tax on profits from the sale of assets, including stocks, real estate, and other investments. However, there are annual exemptions and reliefs that reduce the effective tax burden on investors. Singapore Singapore does not impose capital gains tax, making it an attractive destination for investors seeking favorable tax conditions. This policy has contributed to the growth of Singapore‚Äôs financial markets and its reputation as a global financial hub. Implications for South Korea By abolishing capital gains tax, South Korea would align itself more closely with jurisdictions like Singapore, potentially enhancing its attractiveness to both domestic and foreign investors. However, it would also need to carefully manage the fiscal implications and ensure that the policy supports sustainable economic growth. Stakeholder Reactions and Public Opinion The DPK‚Äôs proposal to abolish capital gains tax on investments has elicited a range of reactions from different stakeholders, including investors, financial institutions, and the general public. Investor Sentiment Investors have generally responded positively to the announcement, viewing it as a favorable development that can enhance their returns and investment opportunities. Both individual and institutional investors anticipate that the abolition of capital gains tax will lead to increased investment activity and higher returns on their portfolios. Financial Institutions Financial institutions, including banks, asset management firms, and brokerage houses, have expressed support for the policy change. They recognize that a more attractive tax environment can lead to increased client engagement, higher asset flows, and greater profitability. Public Opinion Public opinion on the abolition of capital gains tax is mixed. While many see it as a boon for investors and the economy, others are concerned about the potential loss of government revenue and the implications for fiscal sustainability. The DPK has been proactive in communicating the long-term benefits of the policy while addressing concerns related to equity and revenue. Political Reactions The DPK‚Äôs proposal has been met with both support and opposition from other political parties. Proponents argue that the policy will drive economic growth and financial innovation, while opponents raise concerns about fiscal implications and equity. The success of the proposal will depend on the DPK‚Äôs ability to build a broad coalition of support within the National Assembly. Strategic Implications for South Korea‚Äôs Economy The abolition of capital gains tax on investments is more than just a tax policy change; it represents a strategic move to position South Korea as a leading financial center in Asia. Enhancing Competitiveness By creating a more favorable tax environment, South Korea can enhance its competitiveness relative to other regional financial hubs. This can attract multinational corporations, financial institutions, and high-net-worth individuals seeking advantageous investment conditions. Encouraging Innovation and Entrepreneurship Lowering the tax burden on investments can free up capital for entrepreneurs and startups, fostering innovation and economic dynamism. This can lead to the creation of new businesses, technologies, and industries that contribute to sustained economic growth. Strengthening the Financial Sector Abolishing capital gains tax can bolster the financial sector by increasing the flow of capital into financial markets. This can lead to greater liquidity, more robust market infrastructure, and enhanced financial services, benefiting both investors and the broader economy. Potential Economic Scenarios Post-Implementation The successful abolition of capital gains tax on investments could lead to various economic scenarios, each with its own set of implications. Scenario 1: Robust Economic Growth In this optimistic scenario, the policy leads to a surge in investment activity, driving economic growth and job creation. Increased capital flows into the financial markets can stimulate innovation, infrastructure development, and overall economic prosperity. Scenario 2: Moderate Growth with Fiscal Adjustments In a more balanced outcome, the abolition of capital gains tax contributes to steady economic growth while the government implements fiscal adjustments to compensate for the loss of tax revenue. This could involve introducing new taxes, cutting expenditures, or enhancing economic efficiencies to maintain fiscal balance. Scenario 3: Economic Challenges and Policy Revisions If the abolition of capital gains tax results in unforeseen economic challenges, such as excessive market speculation or significant revenue shortfalls, the government may need to revisit and revise the policy. This could involve reintroducing certain taxes, implementing regulatory measures, or enhancing fiscal policies to mitigate adverse effects. Comparative Policy Analysis: Pros and Cons Analyzing the potential benefits and drawbacks of abolishing capital gains tax on investments can provide a clearer understanding of the policy‚Äôs impact. Pros Increased Investment Activity: Lowering the tax burden encourages more individuals and institutions to invest, leading to higher capital flows into the financial markets. Economic Growth: Enhanced investment can drive economic growth, create jobs, and foster innovation and entrepreneurship. Attraction of Foreign Investments: A favorable tax environment can attract foreign capital, boosting South Korea‚Äôs position as a global financial hub. Investor Confidence: The policy signals government support for the financial sector, enhancing investor confidence and trust in the market. Cons Revenue Loss: Abolishing capital gains tax could lead to a significant loss of government revenue, necessitating alternative measures to maintain fiscal balance. Market Speculation: Lower taxes on investments might encourage speculative trading, potentially increasing market volatility and risks. Equity Concerns: The policy may disproportionately benefit high-income individuals who are more likely to engage in investment activities, raising concerns about income inequality and fairness. Regulatory Challenges: Managing increased investment activity and ensuring market stability may require enhanced regulatory oversight and measures to prevent financial misconduct. Lessons Learned from Other Jurisdictions Examining the experiences of other countries that have implemented similar policies can offer valuable insights into the potential outcomes and best practices for South Korea. Singapore‚Äôs No Capital Gains Tax Policy Singapore does not impose capital gains tax, making it an attractive destination for investors. This policy has contributed to the growth of Singapore‚Äôs financial markets and its reputation as a global financial hub. However, Singapore balances this with other forms of taxation and robust regulatory frameworks to maintain fiscal stability and market integrity. Switzerland‚Äôs Financial Policies Switzerland offers favorable tax conditions for investors, including low or zero capital gains tax on certain investments. This has helped establish Switzerland as a leading financial center. The country‚Äôs success is attributed to its comprehensive regulatory environment, political stability, and strong financial institutions. Lessons for South Korea South Korea can draw lessons from these jurisdictions by ensuring that the abolition of capital gains tax is complemented by robust regulatory measures, diversified revenue streams, and policies that promote inclusive growth. Additionally, proactive communication and stakeholder engagement are crucial to address concerns and build broad-based support for the policy. Technological Integration and Financial Innovation The DPK‚Äôs policy initiative aligns with broader trends in technological integration and financial innovation, positioning South Korea at the forefront of modern financial practices. Fintech and Investment Platforms The rise of financial technology (fintech) has revolutionized investment platforms, making them more accessible and user-friendly. By abolishing capital gains tax, South Korea can further stimulate the growth of fintech solutions that facilitate seamless and efficient investment experiences for users. Blockchain and Digital Assets Blockchain technology and digital assets are transforming the financial landscape. Enhanced investment policies can encourage the adoption of blockchain-based financial instruments and digital assets, fostering innovation and expanding the range of investment options available to investors. Data Analytics and AI in Investments Advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly being used to optimize investment strategies and enhance risk management. By promoting a more investment-friendly environment, South Korea can attract investments in these cutting-edge technologies, driving further advancements in the financial sector. Strategic Recommendations for Implementation To ensure the successful implementation of the capital gains tax abolition, the DPK should consider the following strategic recommendations: Comprehensive Impact Assessment Conduct a thorough impact assessment to evaluate the potential economic, fiscal, and social implications of abolishing capital gains tax. This assessment should inform the development of complementary policies and measures to mitigate any adverse effects. Stakeholder Engagement Engage with key stakeholders, including investors, financial institutions, policymakers, and the general public, to gather feedback and build consensus around the policy change. Transparent communication and collaboration can help address concerns and ensure broad-based support. Fiscal Planning and Revenue Management Develop a robust fiscal plan to address the loss of tax revenue resulting from the abolition. This could involve identifying alternative revenue streams, implementing cost-saving measures, or introducing targeted taxes to compensate for the deficit. Strengthening Regulatory Frameworks Enhance regulatory frameworks to manage increased investment activity and prevent market misconduct. This includes implementing measures to curb excessive speculation, ensure market transparency, and protect investor interests. Monitoring and Evaluation Establish mechanisms for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the policy‚Äôs impact. Regular assessments can help identify any emerging challenges and enable timely adjustments to the policy as needed. Conclusion The abolition of capital gains tax on investments by South Korea‚Äôs main opposition party, the Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), represents a transformative shift in the nation‚Äôs fiscal and economic policy. Scheduled for the December 10 session of the National Assembly, this initiative aims to foster a more investment-friendly environment, stimulate economic growth, and enhance South Korea‚Äôs competitiveness on the global financial stage. While the policy offers numerous benefits, including increased investment activity, attraction of foreign capital, and economic growth, it also presents challenges such as potential revenue loss, market speculation, and equity concerns. To navigate these complexities, the DPK must implement complementary measures, engage with stakeholders, and ensure robust regulatory frameworks to support sustainable and inclusive economic development. As South Korea moves forward with this significant policy change, the balance between fostering investment and maintaining fiscal and market stability will be crucial. The successful abolition of capital gains tax on investments has the potential to propel South Korea‚Äôs financial markets to new heights, positioning the nation as a leading hub for investment and innovation in the years to come.

37418715,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108278,1733738824,USDT Trades at Kimchi Discount on Upbit Amid Rising USD/KRW Rates,"In the dynamic landscape of cryptocurrency trading, USDT trades at Kimchi discount on Upbit amid rising USD/KRW rates, signaling significant shifts in the South Korean crypto market. As of 11:08 KST on December 9, the USD/KRW forex currency pair is trading at 1,435.40 KRW. In stark contrast, on the South Korean crypto exchange Upbit, the USDT/KRW pair is trading at 1,409 KRW, reflecting a ‚ÄúKimchi discount.‚Äù This phenomenon indicates that USDT is trading cheaper on South Korean exchanges compared to the official forex rate, presenting both opportunities and challenges for investors and the broader crypto ecosystem in South Korea. Understanding the Kimchi Discount The term ‚ÄúKimchi discount‚Äù refers to the premium or discount applied to cryptocurrency prices on South Korean exchanges relative to global or official forex rates. In this context, the discount implies that USDT (Tether) is available at a lower price on Upbit compared to its value when converted through the official USD/KRW exchange rate. Factors Contributing to the Kimchi Discount Several factors contribute to the emergence of the Kimchi discount: Regulatory Environment: South Korea has stringent regulations governing cryptocurrency transactions. Compliance costs and regulatory scrutiny can lead to price discrepancies between local exchanges and international markets. Market Demand and Supply: High demand for USDT within South Korea, coupled with limited supply on local exchanges, can create price differentials. Investors seeking stability amid market volatility may prefer USDT, driving its price up locally. Capital Controls: South Korea enforces capital controls to manage the flow of money in and out of the country. These controls can limit the arbitrage opportunities that typically help align prices across different markets. Exchange Liquidity: The liquidity of USDT on Upbit compared to other global exchanges affects its pricing. Lower liquidity can result in higher volatility and price discrepancies. Impact of Rising USD/KRW Rates The rise in USD/KRW rates plays a pivotal role in the Kimchi discount phenomenon. As the Korean won depreciates against the U.S. dollar, the cost of holding and trading USD-denominated assets like USDT becomes more expensive for South Korean investors. This depreciation can lead to increased demand for USDT as a hedge against currency volatility, thereby influencing its trading price on local exchanges. Economic Implications Inflation and Purchasing Power: A rising USD/KRW rate can erode the purchasing power of the Korean won, leading investors to seek stable assets like USDT. This behavior can amplify the Kimchi discount as more capital flows into USDT, increasing its local price. Foreign Investment: The differential in USDT pricing can attract foreign investors looking to exploit arbitrage opportunities. However, capital controls may limit their ability to take full advantage, sustaining the price disparity. Monetary Policy: The South Korean government and the Bank of Korea may adjust monetary policies in response to significant shifts in forex rates and crypto market dynamics, potentially influencing future price trends. Investor Perspectives Opportunities Arbitrage Opportunities: Savvy investors may exploit the Kimchi discount by buying USDT on Upbit at a lower price and selling it on global exchanges at a higher rate, profiting from the price differential. Hedging Against Currency Risk: Investors seeking to protect their assets from currency depreciation can use USDT as a stable store of value, especially in a volatile forex environment. Increased Liquidity: The presence of a Kimchi discount can enhance liquidity on South Korean exchanges, making it easier for investors to enter and exit positions without significantly impacting the market. Challenges Regulatory Risks: The South Korean government may impose stricter regulations to address price discrepancies and prevent potential market manipulation, posing risks to investors engaged in arbitrage or large-scale USDT purchases. Market Volatility: Significant price differences can lead to increased market volatility, affecting the stability of investments and potentially leading to rapid price swings. Liquidity Constraints: While the Kimchi discount can enhance liquidity, it may also create liquidity constraints if too many investors attempt to exploit the discount simultaneously, leading to potential price collapses or freezes. Strategic Responses from Exchanges Upbit‚Äôs Position As one of South Korea‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency exchanges, Upbit plays a crucial role in the local crypto market dynamics. To manage the Kimchi discount and maintain market stability, Upbit may adopt several strategies: Enhanced Liquidity Management: By increasing the liquidity of USDT on its platform, Upbit can help narrow the price gap between local and global markets. Regulatory Compliance: Upbit must ensure strict adherence to South Korean regulations to avoid legal repercussions and maintain investor trust. This includes implementing robust KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) protocols. Market Surveillance: Implementing advanced market surveillance systems can help detect and prevent fraudulent activities, ensuring a fair trading environment for all participants. Other South Korean Exchanges Competitors of Upbit in the South Korean market may also take steps to address the Kimchi discount, such as: Competitive Pricing: Offering competitive pricing for USDT can attract more investors to their platforms, increasing overall market liquidity. Innovative Financial Products: Introducing new financial products like USDT-based derivatives or lending services can provide additional avenues for investors, potentially mitigating the impact of the Kimchi discount. Collaborations and Partnerships: Forming strategic partnerships with global exchanges or financial institutions can enhance cross-border trading capabilities and reduce price discrepancies. Regulatory Responses and Policy Implications Government Oversight The South Korean government is likely to intensify its oversight of cryptocurrency markets in response to the Kimchi discount phenomenon. Key regulatory measures may include: Enhanced Reporting Requirements: Implementing stricter reporting standards for cryptocurrency transactions can improve transparency and reduce the likelihood of price manipulation. Taxation Policies: Revising taxation policies on cryptocurrency gains can influence investor behavior and potentially address price disparities. Capital Control Adjustments: Adjusting capital controls to manage the flow of foreign investment into the crypto market can help stabilize local exchange rates and reduce the Kimchi discount. Policy Development The government may develop new policies aimed at harmonizing local and global cryptocurrency prices, such as: Price Stabilization Mechanisms: Introducing mechanisms to stabilize cryptocurrency prices on local exchanges, potentially through reserve funds or pegging strategies. Incentives for Global Integration: Offering incentives for South Korean exchanges to integrate more closely with global markets can reduce price gaps and enhance market efficiency. Educational Campaigns: Promoting investor education on cryptocurrency risks and benefits can lead to more informed investment decisions, contributing to market stability. Technological Innovations Addressing Price Discrepancies Blockchain Analytics Advanced blockchain analytics tools can help identify and address the causes of the Kimchi discount by providing real-time insights into trading patterns, liquidity flows, and market sentiment. These tools enable exchanges and regulators to monitor market activities more effectively, ensuring fair pricing and preventing manipulation. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning AI and machine learning algorithms can predict price trends and detect anomalies in trading behavior, allowing exchanges to respond proactively to potential issues. By leveraging these technologies, Upbit and other exchanges can enhance their market surveillance capabilities and maintain price integrity. Automated Trading Systems Implementing automated trading systems can help manage liquidity and reduce price volatility. These systems can execute trades based on predefined criteria, ensuring that USDT prices remain consistent across different trading platforms and minimizing the impact of external factors like rising USD/KRW rates. Comparative Analysis: Kimchi Discount vs. Global Market Trends Regional Price Disparities Price discrepancies like the Kimchi discount are not unique to South Korea. Similar phenomena have been observed in other regions where local regulatory environments, market demand, and capital flows create price gaps between local and global markets. Comparing South Korea‚Äôs situation with other markets can provide valuable insights into managing and mitigating such discrepancies. Global Arbitrage Opportunities Arbitrage opportunities exist when price differences between markets can be exploited for profit. While the Kimchi discount presents such opportunities, factors like capital controls, transaction fees, and regulatory constraints can limit the extent to which arbitrage is feasible. Understanding these limitations is crucial for investors looking to capitalize on price differences. Market Integration Efforts Efforts to integrate local and global markets can reduce price disparities and enhance market efficiency. International collaborations between exchanges, standardized regulatory frameworks, and improved cross-border trading infrastructure are essential for achieving greater market integration and minimizing phenomena like the Kimchi discount. Investor Strategies Amid the Kimchi Discount Diversification Investors can mitigate risks associated with the Kimchi discount by diversifying their portfolios across different asset classes and geographic regions. Diversification reduces exposure to local market fluctuations and enhances overall portfolio resilience. Hedging Strategies Implementing hedging strategies, such as using derivatives or holding multiple stablecoins, can protect against adverse price movements. Hedging allows investors to manage risk and stabilize returns, even in volatile market conditions. Long-Term Investment Perspective Adopting a long-term investment perspective can help investors navigate short-term price discrepancies like the Kimchi discount. Focusing on the fundamental value of assets and maintaining a disciplined investment approach can yield substantial returns over time, despite temporary market inefficiencies. Case Studies: Kimchi Discount in Action Example 1: Arbitrage Opportunity An investor notices that USDT is trading at a 2% discount on Upbit compared to the official USD/KRW rate. By purchasing USDT on Upbit and selling it on a global exchange where the price is higher, the investor can capitalize on the price differential. However, the feasibility of this strategy depends on factors like transaction fees, transfer times, and regulatory restrictions. Example 2: Institutional Investment A South Korean financial institution anticipates that the Kimchi discount will persist due to ongoing capital controls and regulatory factors. To leverage this, the institution decides to increase its holdings of USDT on local exchanges, expecting that the discount will provide higher returns when the market normalizes or regulatory changes reduce the price gap. Example 3: Retail Investor Approach A retail investor aims to use the Kimchi discount as a hedge against currency depreciation. By allocating a portion of their portfolio to USDT on Upbit, the investor can protect their assets from the declining value of the Korean won, ensuring greater financial stability amidst rising USD/KRW rates. Future Outlook: Sustaining the Kimchi Discount Potential for Price Normalization The Kimchi discount may normalize as regulatory measures are implemented and market dynamics stabilize. Increased transparency, improved liquidity, and enhanced regulatory frameworks can reduce price discrepancies, aligning local and global USDT prices more closely. Long-Term Market Trends Long-term trends, such as the continued adoption of cryptocurrencies and the evolution of financial markets, will influence the sustainability of the Kimchi discount. As the crypto market matures and becomes more integrated globally, price disparities are likely to diminish, fostering a more efficient and unified trading environment. Technological Advancements Advancements in trading technologies and financial infrastructure will play a crucial role in managing and mitigating price discrepancies. Innovations such as decentralized exchanges, blockchain-based liquidity pools, and real-time market monitoring tools can enhance market efficiency and reduce the likelihood of sustained price gaps. Policy Recommendations for Mitigating the Kimchi Discount Enhancing Regulatory Coordination South Korea can enhance regulatory coordination with global financial authorities to align cryptocurrency regulations and reduce price discrepancies. International cooperation and standardized regulatory frameworks can facilitate smoother cross-border trading and minimize arbitrage opportunities. Promoting Market Transparency Promoting greater transparency in cryptocurrency trading can help reduce price discrepancies. Requiring exchanges to disclose comprehensive trading data, liquidity metrics, and market sentiment indicators can provide investors with the information needed to make informed decisions and reduce the likelihood of price manipulation. Supporting Financial Innovation Encouraging financial innovation through supportive policies and incentives can enhance market efficiency and reduce price gaps. By fostering the development of advanced trading platforms, blockchain technologies, and financial instruments, South Korea can create a more robust and integrated crypto market. Implementing Tax Incentives Implementing tax incentives for cryptocurrency investments can attract more investors to the local market, increasing liquidity and reducing price discrepancies. Tax benefits can encourage both domestic and foreign investors to engage in USDT trading on South Korean exchanges, promoting market stability and alignment with global prices. Lessons Learned from the Kimchi Discount Importance of Regulatory Adaptability The emergence of the Kimchi discount highlights the importance of regulatory adaptability in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. Policymakers must remain agile, adjusting regulations to address new market phenomena and ensure that the financial system remains stable and efficient. Balancing Innovation and Stability Balancing financial innovation with market stability is crucial for managing price discrepancies like the Kimchi discount. Encouraging technological advancements and investment while implementing measures to prevent market manipulation and excessive volatility can foster a healthy and sustainable crypto ecosystem. Investor Education and Awareness Educating investors about market dynamics, regulatory environments, and risk management strategies is essential for navigating phenomena like the Kimchi discount. Informed investors are better equipped to make strategic decisions, reducing the impact of price discrepancies on their portfolios and contributing to overall market stability. Conclusion The USDT trades at Kimchi discount on Upbit amid rising USD/KRW rates is a noteworthy development in South Korea‚Äôs cryptocurrency market. This price discrepancy, driven by regulatory factors, market demand, and currency fluctuations, presents both opportunities and challenges for investors and financial institutions. As South Korea navigates this complex landscape, the balance between regulatory oversight, market innovation, and investor protection will be crucial in shaping the future of the local crypto market. Addressing the Kimchi discount requires a multifaceted approach, including enhancing regulatory coordination, promoting market transparency, and supporting financial innovation. By implementing strategic policies and leveraging technological advancements, South Korea can mitigate price discrepancies, foster a more efficient and integrated crypto market, and position itself as a leading financial hub in the region. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, phenomena like the Kimchi discount will serve as valuable case studies for other markets grappling with similar challenges.

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address ‚Äì C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM ‚Äì in the receiving field.

37418713,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108281,1733738768,"Iran Shifts Focus to Regulating Crypto, Says Economic Minister","In a transformative move for the Middle Eastern nation‚Äôs financial landscape, Iran is shifting its focus from restricting to regulating crypto , as announced by Iran‚Äôs Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance, Abdolnaser Hemmati. This strategic pivot marks a significant departure from previous stringent measures against cryptocurrencies, signaling Iran‚Äôs intent to harness the potential of digital assets to foster economic growth, create jobs, and mitigate the impacts of international sanctions. Overview of Iran‚Äôs New Crypto Regulation Strategy The decision to transition from restrictive policies to a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies represents a pivotal shift in Iran‚Äôs economic strategy. According to Abdolnaser Hemmati, this change aims to integrate digital assets into the national economy in a controlled and beneficial manner. By prioritizing regulation over restriction, Iran seeks to capitalize on the innovative capabilities of cryptocurrencies while addressing potential risks associated with their use. Key Objectives of the Regulation Economic Growth: Leveraging cryptocurrencies to stimulate economic activities and attract both domestic and foreign investments. Job Creation: Utilizing the burgeoning crypto industry to generate employment opportunities, particularly for the youth. Sanctions Mitigation: Employing digital assets as a tool to circumvent the financial restrictions imposed by international sanctions. Financial Inclusion: Promoting broader access to financial services through the adoption of blockchain technology and digital currencies. The Role of Iran‚Äôs Central Bank in Crypto Regulation Abdolnaser Hemmati emphasized the central bank‚Äôs crucial role in overseeing the regulation of digital assets. The Central Bank of Iran (CBI) is tasked with establishing comprehensive guidelines and frameworks to ensure that cryptocurrencies are integrated safely and effectively into the financial system. Central Bank Initiatives Regulatory Framework Development: Crafting policies that define the legal status of cryptocurrencies, outline compliance requirements, and establish operational standards for crypto exchanges and service providers. Monitoring and Compliance: Implementing robust monitoring systems to track cryptocurrency transactions and ensure adherence to anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) regulations. Collaboration with Financial Institutions: Partnering with banks and financial entities to facilitate the seamless integration of digital assets into traditional banking services. Potential Benefits of Regulating Crypto in Iran The shift towards regulating cryptocurrencies is anticipated to yield multiple benefits for Iran‚Äôs economy and its citizens. 1. Job Creation and Economic Diversification By fostering a regulated crypto environment, Iran aims to create new job opportunities in various sectors, including blockchain development, cybersecurity, financial services, and digital marketing. This diversification is crucial for reducing the economy‚Äôs reliance on oil exports and enhancing its resilience against external shocks. 2. Attraction of Foreign Investments A clear and supportive regulatory framework is expected to attract foreign investors who are keen on exploring opportunities in Iran‚Äôs emerging crypto market. This influx of capital can drive technological advancements, infrastructure development, and overall economic growth. 3. Enhancing Financial Inclusion Cryptocurrencies can provide financial services to underserved populations, including those in remote areas or with limited access to traditional banking. By regulating crypto, Iran can promote greater financial inclusion, enabling more citizens to participate in the digital economy. 4. Mitigating the Impact of Sanctions Digital assets offer a means to bypass traditional financial channels that are often targeted by international sanctions. By regulating cryptocurrencies, Iran can develop alternative mechanisms for conducting international trade and financial transactions, thereby reducing the adverse effects of sanctions on its economy. Challenges and Considerations While the regulatory shift presents numerous opportunities, it also entails several challenges that Iran must address to ensure the successful integration of cryptocurrencies into its financial system. 1. Regulatory Compliance and Enforcement Establishing effective regulatory frameworks requires meticulous planning and execution. Iran must ensure that its regulations are comprehensive, clear, and adaptable to the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Additionally, robust enforcement mechanisms are essential to prevent illicit activities and maintain market integrity. 2. Technological Infrastructure Developing the necessary technological infrastructure to support cryptocurrency regulation is critical. This includes advanced blockchain analytics tools, secure digital wallets, and reliable exchange platforms. Investing in cutting-edge technology will enable the central bank and other financial institutions to manage and oversee digital assets efficiently. 3. Public Awareness and Education Educating the public about the benefits and risks associated with cryptocurrencies is vital for fostering informed participation. Iran must undertake extensive awareness campaigns to inform citizens about safe investment practices, regulatory compliance, and the potential impact of digital assets on the economy. 4. Balancing Innovation with Security Encouraging innovation in the crypto space while ensuring robust security measures is a delicate balance. Iran must implement stringent cybersecurity protocols to protect against hacking, fraud, and other cyber threats that could undermine the stability of the crypto market. Comparative Analysis: Iran‚Äôs Approach vs. Global Trends Iran‚Äôs regulatory shift can be contextualized within broader global trends towards cryptocurrency regulation. Countries worldwide are grappling with the challenge of integrating digital assets into their economies while addressing associated risks. United States The United States has adopted a mixed approach to crypto regulation, with agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) overseeing different aspects of the market. The focus is on protecting investors, preventing fraud, and ensuring market stability. European Union The European Union is moving towards a unified regulatory framework with the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. MiCA aims to harmonize crypto regulations across member states, promoting innovation while safeguarding consumers and financial stability. Singapore Singapore has positioned itself as a crypto-friendly hub by implementing clear regulations and fostering a supportive environment for blockchain innovation. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) oversees the regulation of digital assets, emphasizing compliance and security. Lessons for Iran Iran can draw valuable lessons from these global examples by adopting best practices in regulatory development, enforcement, and technological integration. Collaboration with international regulatory bodies and participation in global crypto forums can enhance Iran‚Äôs regulatory capabilities and ensure alignment with international standards. Strategic Implications for Iran‚Äôs Economy The move to regulate crypto has far-reaching implications for Iran‚Äôs economic strategy and its position in the global financial system. Enhancing Economic Resilience Diversifying the economy through the integration of digital assets can enhance Iran‚Äôs resilience against external economic pressures, including sanctions and oil price fluctuations. A robust crypto market can provide alternative revenue streams and foster economic stability. Promoting Technological Advancement Regulating cryptocurrencies encourages investment in blockchain technology and related innovations. This can drive advancements in sectors such as fintech, cybersecurity, and digital services, positioning Iran as a leader in technological innovation in the region. Strengthening International Relations By developing a regulated crypto market, Iran can engage more effectively with international investors and financial institutions. This can facilitate better economic relations and open avenues for collaboration in the digital economy. Policy Recommendations for Effective Crypto Regulation To maximize the benefits and mitigate the challenges of regulating cryptocurrencies, Iran should consider the following policy recommendations: 1. Comprehensive Regulatory Framework Develop a detailed and flexible regulatory framework that addresses all aspects of cryptocurrency operations, including issuance, trading, taxation, and compliance. The framework should be adaptable to technological advancements and market changes. 2. Strengthening Cybersecurity Measures Invest in advanced cybersecurity infrastructure to protect digital assets and ensure the integrity of crypto transactions. Collaborate with international cybersecurity experts to implement best practices and safeguard against cyber threats. 3. Promoting Public-Private Partnerships Foster collaboration between the government, financial institutions, and private sector entities to drive innovation and enhance regulatory compliance. Public-private partnerships can facilitate the development of secure and efficient crypto platforms. 4. Enhancing Financial Literacy Implement educational programs to improve financial literacy and awareness of cryptocurrencies among the general public. Empowering citizens with knowledge about digital assets can promote responsible investment and reduce the risk of fraud. 5. Facilitating International Cooperation Engage in international dialogue and cooperation to align crypto regulations with global standards. Participation in international forums and collaborations with foreign regulatory bodies can enhance Iran‚Äôs regulatory capabilities and promote cross-border crypto activities. Case Studies: Successful Crypto Regulation Models Examining successful models of crypto regulation can provide valuable insights for Iran‚Äôs approach.

Job creation and increased economic assets contribute to higher living standards and greater economic stability. Scenario 2: Moderate Growth with Fiscal Adjustments A balanced outcome sees steady economic growth driven by crypto investments, complemented by fiscal adjustments to address any revenue shortfalls from the removal of restrictive measures. The government implements alternative revenue streams and cost-saving measures to maintain fiscal health. Scenario 3: Economic Challenges and Policy Revisions If unforeseen challenges arise, such as excessive market volatility or significant revenue loss, the government may need to revise its crypto policies. This could involve reintroducing certain regulations, implementing market stabilization measures, or enhancing fiscal policies to address economic imbalances. Conclusion Regulating crypto in Iran represents a strategic shift towards embracing digital innovation and fostering economic growth. By prioritizing regulation over restrictions, Iran aims to integrate cryptocurrencies into its financial system in a controlled and beneficial manner. This policy change holds the potential to create jobs, attract investments, and mitigate the impacts of international sanctions, thereby enhancing the nation‚Äôs economic resilience and technological advancement. However, the transition also presents challenges, including regulatory compliance, technological infrastructure development, and public education.

An overview of the 7-day chart shows stability. Seeing this, holders are already in the market, searching for the next big thing. 1Fuel (OFT) is recommended to Avalanche and Cardano holders as the best cryptocurrency to buy at the moment. What gives 1Fuel the edge over AVAX and ADA is that it is still in its initial stage and has room for significant growth.

Join the presale today Avalanche‚Äôs Uphill Battle: Whale Activity and Holder Profitability Not Enough to Break $70 The AVAX market is heavily dominated by whales, which could see a massive downside if they pulled out of the project. Whale addresses holding at least 1% of an asset‚Äôs supply‚Äîcurrently control an alarming 27.38% of the Avalanche supply. Many analysts are of the opinion that Avalanche won‚Äôt be reaching the $70 mark soon. According to their analysis, the token‚Äôs value relies heavily on a few high-value players rather than widespread adoption. This imbalance, therefore, affects long-term sustainability. Those looking for a token that embodies centralization can invest in 1Fuel. Unlike Avalanche, the project encourages the involvement of retail participants. Additionally, there is a balance that would prevent whale dominance when the project launches on top cryptocurrency exchanges. Buy 1Fuel now ADA‚Äôs Price Plateau: Cardano Faces Key Hurdle at $1.25 Despite achieving a $1.318 yearly high, Cardano has failed to sustain its momentum. The asset has retreated, unable to surpass the $1.25 resistance level. This persistent selling pressure highlights ADA‚Äôs inability to break through a key barrier, raising concerns among holders. Cardano has experienced a significant outflow of $98.37 million. This is not a good sign, as whales and institutional investors are pulling out huge sums from the project. If the outflow continues, there could be massive sell-offs. Without breaking the $1.25 barrier, Cardano risks stagnation and losing investor interest. However, investors can still make the most of the bull run by investing in 1Fuel (OFT). The token is currently the best cryptocurrency to buy, with a 500x growth potential.

37418712,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108283,1733738700,Coinbase CEO Urges Senate to Reject Re-Nomination of Anti-Crypto SEC Commissioner,"In a bold and highly publicized move, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has publicly urged the U.S. Senate Banking Committee (SBC) to reject the re-nomination of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw . Armstrong‚Äôs outspoken criticism centers on Crenshaw‚Äôs perceived anti-crypto stance, particularly her efforts to block Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETFs and her alignment with policies deemed unfavorable to the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry. This development underscores the ongoing tensions between traditional financial regulators and the rapidly evolving crypto market, highlighting the critical role of leadership within regulatory bodies in shaping the future of digital assets. The Clash Between Coinbase and SEC Leadership Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, one of the largest and most influential cryptocurrency exchanges globally, has taken a firm stand against Caroline Crenshaw‚Äôs re-nomination to the SEC. On his social media platform, X (formerly known as Twitter), Armstrong articulated his concerns about Crenshaw‚Äôs effectiveness in her role and her impact on the crypto industry. He criticized her for what he perceives as a failure to support the growth and integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream financial systems. Criticism of Crenshaw‚Äôs Anti-Crypto Actions Armstrong‚Äôs primary contention lies in Crenshaw‚Äôs attempts to block the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs. ETFs, or Exchange-Traded Funds, are investment funds traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. A Bitcoin spot ETF would allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without having to directly purchase and manage the cryptocurrency, making it more accessible to a broader range of investors. Crenshaw‚Äôs opposition to such products has been a point of contention, as many in the crypto community view ETFs as a critical step towards legitimizing and mainstreaming Bitcoin and other digital assets. Armstrong went further to assert that Crenshaw is ‚Äúworse than SEC Chair Gary Gensler‚Äù on certain issues. Gary Gensler, known for his stringent regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies, has been a polarizing figure in the crypto world. By comparing Crenshaw unfavorably to Gensler, Armstrong is emphasizing his belief that Crenshaw‚Äôs regulatory stance is detrimental to the growth and innovation within the crypto sector. The Importance of Leadership in Regulatory Bodies The leadership within regulatory bodies like the SEC plays a pivotal role in shaping the landscape of financial markets, including the cryptocurrency sector. Commissioners and chairpersons set the tone for regulatory policies, enforcement priorities, and the overall approach towards emerging financial technologies. Armstrong‚Äôs call for rejecting Crenshaw‚Äôs re-nomination highlights the significant influence that executive leadership can have on the trajectory of the crypto industry. The SEC‚Äôs Stance on Cryptocurrency Regulation Caroline Crenshaw, as a commissioner of the SEC, has been at the forefront of the agency‚Äôs regulatory efforts concerning cryptocurrencies. Her approach has been characterized by a focus on investor protection, market integrity, and the prevention of fraudulent activities within the crypto space. While these are critical objectives, Crenshaw‚Äôs methods and decisions have been perceived by some, including Armstrong, as overly restrictive and hindering innovation. Blocking Bitcoin Spot ETFs One of the most notable actions taken by Crenshaw has been her opposition to the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs. Despite multiple attempts by various financial institutions to gain SEC approval for such products, Crenshaw has remained a vocal opponent. Her stance is grounded in concerns about market manipulation, liquidity, and the overall stability of the crypto markets. However, critics argue that her refusal to approve Bitcoin spot ETFs stifles investor access and slows the integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial portfolios. Aligning with SEC Chair Gary Gensler Crenshaw is often seen as a close ally of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has taken a stringent regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies. Gensler has advocated for comprehensive oversight of the crypto industry, emphasizing the need for clear regulations to protect investors and maintain market integrity. While their alignment ensures a unified front within the SEC, it also means that the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies remains stringent, potentially limiting the industry‚Äôs growth and innovation. Impact on the Cryptocurrency Industry Armstrong‚Äôs public call for rejecting Crenshaw‚Äôs re-nomination is not merely a personal vendetta but reflects broader frustrations within the crypto community regarding regulatory approaches. The implications of such regulatory stances are far-reaching, affecting everything from investment strategies to technological innovation within the crypto space. Investor Confidence and Market Growth Regulatory clarity and supportive policies are essential for fostering investor confidence in the cryptocurrency market. When leaders like Crenshaw block the introduction of financial products like Bitcoin spot ETFs, it can create uncertainty and hesitation among investors. This, in turn, can slow down market growth and the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Armstrong argues that Crenshaw‚Äôs actions are counterproductive, as they prevent the crypto industry from reaching its full potential. By advocating for the rejection of Crenshaw‚Äôs re-nomination, Armstrong is essentially calling for a more balanced regulatory approach that supports innovation while ensuring investor protection. Innovation and Technological Advancement Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology represent significant technological advancements with the potential to revolutionize various sectors, including finance, supply chain management, and more. Overly restrictive regulations can hinder the development and deployment of these technologies, limiting their benefits and delaying their integration into everyday use. The SEC‚Äôs current approach, as championed by Crenshaw, emphasizes caution and oversight. While this is necessary to prevent fraud and protect investors, it must be balanced with efforts to support technological innovation and market growth. Armstrong‚Äôs critique suggests that the SEC, under Crenshaw‚Äôs influence, may be tipping too far towards restriction at the expense of fostering a vibrant and innovative crypto ecosystem. The Senate Banking Committee‚Äôs Role The Senate Banking Committee (SBC) plays a crucial role in the confirmation process of SEC commissioners. Their decisions directly impact the leadership and direction of the SEC. Armstrong‚Äôs public statement serves as a call to action for the SBC to consider the broader implications of Crenshaw‚Äôs re-nomination on the cryptocurrency industry and the overall financial market. Evaluating Crenshaw‚Äôs Performance As the SBC reviews Crenshaw‚Äôs re-nomination, Armstrong‚Äôs critique adds another layer of scrutiny to her performance and impact on the crypto industry. The committee must weigh Crenshaw‚Äôs contributions to investor protection and market integrity against the potential drawbacks of her restrictive stance on crypto innovation. Balancing Regulatory Oversight and Innovation The SBC‚Äôs decision will reflect its stance on balancing regulatory oversight with the need to support innovation in emerging financial technologies. A decision to reject Crenshaw‚Äôs re-nomination could signal a shift towards a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, potentially paving the way for more supportive policies and products like Bitcoin spot ETFs. The Crypto Community‚Äôs Watchful Eye Armstrong stressed that the Senate Banking Committee should remember that ‚Äúthe crypto community is watching closely.‚Äù This statement underscores the high stakes involved in Crenshaw‚Äôs re-nomination and the broader regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. The crypto community, comprising investors, developers, and enthusiasts, is highly engaged and sensitive to regulatory changes that could impact the industry‚Äôs future. Community Expectations The crypto community expects regulators to adopt policies that support growth, innovation, and investor protection. They seek a regulatory framework that provides clarity and reduces uncertainty, enabling businesses and investors to operate with confidence. Crenshaw‚Äôs current approach is perceived by some in the community as a barrier to these goals, prompting calls for a more balanced and supportive regulatory stance. Potential for Regulatory Reform Armstrong‚Äôs push against Crenshaw‚Äôs re-nomination may spark broader discussions about the direction of cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S. It could lead to increased advocacy for regulatory reforms that better accommodate the unique characteristics of digital assets while maintaining necessary safeguards. Broader Implications for the SEC and Financial Regulation The controversy surrounding Crenshaw‚Äôs re-nomination extends beyond the crypto industry, reflecting broader debates about the role of the SEC in regulating emerging financial technologies. The SEC‚Äôs Evolving Mandate As financial markets evolve with the advent of cryptocurrencies, the SEC‚Äôs mandate must adapt to address new challenges and opportunities. Commissioners like Crenshaw are at the forefront of this evolution, tasked with balancing the enforcement of existing laws with the need to accommodate innovative financial products and technologies. Influence of Industry Leaders Industry leaders like Armstrong play a significant role in shaping regulatory discourse. Their insights and critiques can influence public opinion and, by extension, regulatory decisions. Armstrong‚Äôs public stance against Crenshaw‚Äôs re-nomination highlights the increasing influence that crypto industry leaders are exerting on regulatory processes. Future of Cryptocurrency Regulation The outcome of Crenshaw‚Äôs re-nomination will have lasting implications for the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S. A rejection could open the door for commissioners with more crypto-friendly views, potentially leading to a more supportive regulatory environment. Conversely, approval of Crenshaw would reinforce the current stringent approach, maintaining the status quo of heavy regulatory oversight. Conclusion The Coinbase CEO‚Äôs opposition to the re-nomination of SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw marks a critical juncture in the ongoing dialogue between the cryptocurrency industry and regulatory authorities. Armstrong‚Äôs public call to action emphasizes the need for a balanced regulatory approach that fosters innovation while ensuring market integrity and investor protection. As the Senate Banking Committee deliberates on Crenshaw‚Äôs re-nomination, the crypto community and the broader financial market are keenly watching, aware that the decision will significantly impact the future trajectory of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States. This clash between industry leaders and regulators underscores the broader challenges and opportunities inherent in integrating disruptive technologies into established financial systems. The outcome of this debate will not only shape the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies but also set a precedent for how emerging financial technologies are governed in the future. As the crypto industry continues to grow and evolve, the importance of effective and forward-thinking regulation becomes ever more paramount in ensuring its sustainable and inclusive development.

37418668,https://crypto.news/?p=14317496,1733738658,Ripple‚Äôs $150 million spending for the last ‚Äòno‚Äô,"Ripple‚Äôs $150 million legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission took center stage during a recent 60 Minutes episode on CBS News. While the segment discussed Ripple‚Äôs legal challenges and the crypto industry‚Äôs growing political influence, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and several community members expressed frustration with the way the story was presented. After the episode aired, Garlinghouse took to X to share his concerns. He emphasized that the interview , which lasted over 90 minutes, failed to include a significant legal development: a federal judge ruled in July that XRP ( XRP ) is not a security when sold on public exchanges. Crypto made its debut on @60Minutes tonight ‚Äì there‚Äôs no doubt that these technologies will continue to become more and more mainstream ‚Äì with influence and reach that will only continue to grow. A few things I do want to comment on after watching: I spoke with Margaret‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 9, 2024 This ruling contradicted claims made during the segment, particularly those by John Reed Stark, a former SEC enforcement head, who insisted XRP should be classified as a security. Garlinghouse accused the program of omitting important context that could have provided a more balanced view of Ripple‚Äôs case. He also criticized Stark‚Äôs broader dismissal of crypto‚Äôs utility, comparing it to early skepticism about the internet. He noted that Ripple is already facilitating billions of dollars in cross-border transactions for institutional clients using XRP, all under compliance with know-your-customer regulations.

37418651,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108285,1733738617,El Salvador BTC Target Raised to $2.2M by Senior Advisor,"In a groundbreaking development within the global cryptocurrency landscape, El Salvador has significantly increased its Bitcoin (BTC) target price from $220,000 to an unprecedented $2.2 million , as announced by Max Keiser, a prominent Bitcoin maximalist and senior BTC advisor to Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele. This substantial upward revision underscores El Salvador‚Äôs unwavering commitment to integrating Bitcoin into its national economy, positioning the nation as a pioneering force in the adoption and regulation of digital assets. Overview of El Salvador‚Äôs Bitcoin Strategy El Salvador has been at the forefront of cryptocurrency adoption since September 2021, when it became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. This bold move aimed to enhance financial inclusion, attract foreign investment, and reduce the nation‚Äôs reliance on the U.S. dollar. President Nayib Bukele‚Äôs administration has since been actively promoting Bitcoin, investing in infrastructure, and fostering a favorable regulatory environment to support the growth of digital assets. Max Keiser‚Äôs Role and Influence Max Keiser, known for his fervent advocacy of Bitcoin, plays a crucial role in shaping El Salvador‚Äôs cryptocurrency policies. As a senior BTC advisor, Keiser provides strategic insights and market analysis to ensure that El Salvador‚Äôs Bitcoin investments align with global trends and maximize economic benefits. His recent announcement of increasing the BTC target price to $2.2 million reflects his optimistic outlook on Bitcoin‚Äôs future and its potential to transform El Salvador‚Äôs economy. The Significance of Raising the BTC Target Price Historical Context El Salvador‚Äôs initial Bitcoin target price of $220,000 was ambitious, aiming to leverage Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility and growth potential to drive economic gains. However, the rapid increase to $2.2 million marks a tenfold rise, signaling a profound shift in the nation‚Äôs investment strategy and confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term prospects. Economic Implications Increased Investment: The higher BTC target price is likely to attract more investors, both domestic and international, seeking to capitalize on Bitcoin‚Äôs projected growth. This influx of capital can bolster El Salvador‚Äôs economy, create jobs, and fund public services. Financial Inclusion: By setting a higher BTC target, El Salvador emphasizes Bitcoin‚Äôs role in promoting financial inclusion. Access to digital currencies can empower unbanked populations, providing them with secure and efficient financial services. Revenue Generation: The substantial unrealized gains from Bitcoin investments can significantly boost the nation‚Äôs revenue streams. With the country currently holding 6,180 BTC at an average purchase price of $44,739.88, the leap to a $2.2 million target could translate into unrealized gains exceeding $12 billion. El Salvador‚Äôs Current Bitcoin Holdings and Performance According to Nayib Tracker, a platform dedicated to monitoring El Salvador‚Äôs BTC investments, the nation currently holds 6,180 BTC with an average purchase price of $44,739.88 . At the current BTC price of approximately $220,000, these holdings represent an unrealized gain of over $330 million . This significant appreciation underscores the potential for even greater returns with the revised target price. Daily Bitcoin Purchases As part of its ongoing commitment, President Bukele announced in 2022 that El Salvador is dedicated to buying one BTC daily . This consistent investment strategy aims to gradually increase the nation‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings, leveraging dollar-cost averaging to mitigate the impact of price volatility and maximize long-term gains. The Role of MicroStrategy and Michael Saylor Max Keiser also highlighted the strategies of Michael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy, as a key factor likely to succeed in boosting Bitcoin‚Äôs value. MicroStrategy has been a major institutional investor in Bitcoin, holding over 100,000 BTC and continuously increasing its holdings despite market fluctuations. Strategic Parallels Long-Term Investment: Both El Salvador and MicroStrategy adopt a long-term investment approach, emphasizing Bitcoin‚Äôs potential to serve as a store of value and hedge against inflation. Institutional Support: The involvement of prominent figures like Michael Saylor and Max Keiser adds credibility to Bitcoin‚Äôs adoption, attracting more institutional investors to the space. Infrastructure Development: Investments in infrastructure, such as Bitcoin ATMs and mining operations, support the broader ecosystem, enhancing Bitcoin‚Äôs utility and accessibility. Regulatory Framework and Government Support El Salvador‚Äôs proactive regulatory stance has been instrumental in fostering a conducive environment for Bitcoin adoption. The government has introduced several measures to support the integration of Bitcoin into the national economy: Bitcoin Wallet Integration The El Salvador government launched the Chivo wallet , a digital wallet designed to facilitate Bitcoin transactions for residents. This initiative aims to streamline the use of Bitcoin for everyday transactions, including bill payments and remittances. Tax Incentives To encourage Bitcoin investments, El Salvador offers tax incentives and exemptions for businesses and individuals engaging in cryptocurrency activities. These incentives aim to attract foreign investment and stimulate economic growth. Public Education and Awareness The government has undertaken extensive public education campaigns to increase awareness about Bitcoin, its benefits, and how to use it safely. These initiatives are crucial for ensuring that the population understands and embraces digital currencies. Potential Benefits of Bitcoin Regulation Job Creation and Economic Diversification The integration of Bitcoin into El Salvador‚Äôs economy can lead to the creation of new job opportunities in various sectors, including blockchain development, cybersecurity, financial services, and digital marketing. Diversifying the economy beyond traditional industries can enhance resilience and reduce dependency on oil exports. Enhanced Financial Services Bitcoin can provide more efficient and secure financial services, particularly for the unbanked and underbanked populations. Access to digital wallets and decentralized financial products can empower individuals with greater control over their finances. Attraction of Foreign Investments A favorable regulatory environment and ambitious Bitcoin investment targets can attract foreign investors looking to participate in El Salvador‚Äôs digital economy. This influx of capital can drive technological advancements and infrastructure development, further boosting the nation‚Äôs economic prospects. Mitigation of Sanctions Impact Bitcoin offers a means to bypass traditional financial channels that are often targeted by international sanctions. By leveraging digital assets, El Salvador can mitigate the adverse effects of sanctions, facilitating smoother international trade and financial transactions. Challenges and Considerations Market Volatility Bitcoin‚Äôs inherent volatility poses significant risks. While the potential for high returns is attractive, price fluctuations can lead to substantial losses. El Salvador must implement risk management strategies to navigate this volatility effectively. Regulatory Compliance and Security Ensuring robust regulatory compliance and cybersecurity measures is critical for maintaining the integrity of Bitcoin transactions and safeguarding the nation‚Äôs digital assets. The Central Bank of Iran‚Äôs role in overseeing digital assets must be complemented by advanced security protocols to prevent hacking and fraud. Public Trust and Adoption Building and maintaining public trust is essential for the successful adoption of Bitcoin. Continuous education and transparent communication are necessary to ensure that the population understands the benefits and risks associated with digital currencies. Infrastructure Development Developing the necessary infrastructure to support widespread Bitcoin adoption, such as Bitcoin ATMs, reliable internet connectivity, and robust digital wallet systems, is crucial. These elements are foundational for enabling seamless and secure transactions.

Key Takeaways for El Salvador: Balanced Regulation: Striking a balance between fostering innovation and ensuring investor protection is crucial. Institutional Support: Support from financial institutions and prominent industry leaders can enhance the credibility of Bitcoin initiatives.

While regulatory clarity is improving, the U.S. continues to grapple with balancing innovation with investor protection. Key Takeaways for El Salvador: Unified Regulatory Framework: Developing a unified and comprehensive regulatory framework can streamline crypto operations and enhance market stability. Continuous Adaptation: Regulatory policies must evolve in tandem with technological advancements and market developments. Stakeholder Engagement: Engaging with industry stakeholders can provide valuable insights and foster collaborative regulatory solutions.

They argue that Bitcoin can serve as a tool for economic empowerment and geopolitical maneuvering, providing the nation with greater financial autonomy and resilience. Case Studies: Successful Bitcoin Integration El Salvador‚Äôs Initial Bitcoin Adoption El Salvador‚Äôs initial adoption of Bitcoin was met with mixed reactions, but it laid the groundwork for integrating digital assets into the national economy. The establishment of the Chivo wallet and the launch of Bitcoin ATMs were critical steps in facilitating widespread Bitcoin usage. Comparison with Past Bitcoin Initiatives Comparing El Salvador‚Äôs Bitcoin initiatives with past efforts in other nations reveals the importance of strategic planning, regulatory support, and public engagement. Successful integration requires a holistic approach that addresses technological, economic, and social factors. Lessons Learned and Best Practices Importance of Regulatory Support Clear and supportive regulatory frameworks are essential for fostering investor confidence and encouraging substantial investments in Bitcoin.

37418667,https://crypto.news/?p=14317500,1733738604,CZ encourages Amazon to accept Bitcoin payments,"Former Binance CEO, Changpeng ‚ÄòCZ‚Äô Zhao, suggests Amazon start accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment in the wake of shareholders requesting the tech giant to consider adding BTC to its treasury. In a recent post, CZ responded to the news about Amazon shareholders requesting board members to conduct an assessment to decide on whether the tech giant should consider adding Bitcoin ( BTC ) its strategic reserve. The former Binance head suggested that the company should start accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment for their online marketplace as a gateway to adding the asset to their reserves. That way, the company can have a better perspective on the value of Bitcoin compared to traditional currencies. ‚ÄúSimple. Accept Bitcoin payments?‚Äù CZ wrote in his post . https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1865854419331600533 You might also like: Microsoft asks shareholders to vote against an assessment of investing in Bitcoin in SEC filing In a separate post, Dash‚Äôs Joel Valenzuela questioned CZ about why Bitcoin should be accepted for Amazon payment when ‚Äúit sucks as a payment method‚Äù compared to other cryptocurrencies in general. CZ agreed with Valenzuela, stating that he made a purchase using Bitcoin worth $17.08 and had to wait 15 minutes for the payment to be confirmed by the receiver. However, he stood by the reasoning that it was a better payment option than traditional finance options like credit transfers which tend to take longer if an error occurs. ‚ÄúStill better than TradFi though. I didn‚Äôt have to call anyone to fix it. It just worked after 15 min. Crypto, I agree,‚Äù said CZ. Most of the comments underneath CZ‚Äôs post echo the same sentiment, expressing optimism that Amazon may one day make the shift to investing in Bitcoin. As previously reported by crypto.news on Dec. 8, global conservative think tank the National Center for Public Policy Research proposed that Amazon should add Bitcoin to the firm‚Äôs strategic reserve. Since a chunk of Amazon‚Äôs total assets are stored in cash, cash equivalents and government bonds, the Washington-based think tank believes that due to the weakening of cash and bond yields, Amazon‚Äôs billion-dollar shareholder value is not being adequately protected by being stored in currency-based assets. Therefore, the NCPPR argued that Amazon has a duty to add assets to its treasury that are not tied to traditional finances, such as Bitcoin. Although the proposal does acknowledge the volatile nature of Bitcoin, it suggested that Amazon should still diversify its balance sheet by investing at least 5% of its assets in Bitcoin.

37418610,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108287,1733738554,Former Binance CEO CZ Wonders If Amazon Will Adopt BTC Payments,"In a rapidly evolving financial landscape, Amazon adopt BTC payments has become a topic of intense speculation and discussion. Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) recently took to his social media platform, X, to express his curiosity about whether the tech giant Amazon might integrate Bitcoin (BTC) into its payment systems. This speculation gains momentum following a report that the National Center for Public Policy Research , a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, submitted a proposal urging Amazon to consider adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy at its April 2025 shareholder meeting. This potential move by Amazon could signal a significant shift in the mainstream acceptance and utilization of cryptocurrencies in everyday commerce. The Growing Intersection of Big Tech and Cryptocurrency The intersection of big tech companies and cryptocurrency has been a focal point of discussion over the past few years. Companies like Tesla, Square, and PayPal have made significant strides in integrating Bitcoin and other digital assets into their business models, signaling a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the mainstream market. Amazon, being one of the world‚Äôs largest and most influential companies, adopting BTC payments would be a monumental step towards further legitimizing Bitcoin as a viable and widely accepted medium of exchange. Amazon‚Äôs Current Stance on Cryptocurrency As of 2024, Amazon has maintained a cautious but open stance towards cryptocurrencies. While the company has not officially integrated Bitcoin into its payment options, it has shown interest in blockchain technology and digital assets through various initiatives. Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers blockchain-related services, and there have been rumors of Amazon exploring its own digital currency. However, the adoption of Bitcoin as a direct payment method remains speculative. The Proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research The National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) , known for its advocacy and policy analysis, submitted a proposal to Amazon encouraging the adoption of a Bitcoin treasury strategy. This proposal suggests that Amazon should allocate a portion of its treasury to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. The idea is to leverage Bitcoin‚Äôs decentralized and finite nature to protect and potentially grow the company‚Äôs reserves. Rationale Behind the Proposal The rationale behind advocating for a Bitcoin treasury strategy is multifaceted: Hedge Against Inflation: Bitcoin is often referred to as ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù due to its limited supply and resistance to inflation. By holding Bitcoin, Amazon could protect its reserves from the devaluation of fiat currencies. Diversification of Assets: Diversifying treasury holdings with Bitcoin could reduce risk by spreading investments across different asset classes. Innovation and Leadership: Adopting Bitcoin could position Amazon as a leader in financial innovation, aligning with its reputation for pioneering new technologies. Market Influence: With Amazon‚Äôs massive financial resources, a treasury investment in Bitcoin could significantly impact the cryptocurrency‚Äôs market dynamics. Changpeng Zhao‚Äôs (CZ) Perspective Changpeng Zhao (CZ) , the former CEO of Binance, one of the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has been a vocal advocate for the adoption and integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream financial systems. In his recent statement on X, CZ expressed his curiosity about Amazon‚Äôs potential adoption of BTC payments, highlighting the transformative impact such a move could have on both the company and the broader crypto market. Importance of Amazon‚Äôs Adoption CZ emphasizes that Amazon‚Äôs adoption of BTC payments could have several significant implications: Mass Adoption: Amazon‚Äôs vast customer base could lead to widespread adoption of Bitcoin, making it a more commonly used and accepted form of payment. Market Legitimization: Integration by a major corporation like Amazon would further legitimize Bitcoin, encouraging other businesses to follow suit. Economic Impact: The increased use of Bitcoin in everyday transactions could drive up its demand and, consequently, its value. Innovation Spur: Amazon‚Äôs entry into BTC payments could spur further innovation in payment technologies, blockchain applications, and financial services. Potential Benefits for Amazon Integrating Bitcoin payments could offer Amazon several strategic advantages: Enhanced Customer Experience By offering Bitcoin as a payment option, Amazon could cater to the growing number of customers who prefer using cryptocurrencies for their transactions. This could enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty among tech-savvy and crypto-enthusiast demographics. Diversified Revenue Streams Bitcoin payments could open new revenue streams for Amazon, including transaction fees and partnerships with crypto-related businesses. Additionally, holding Bitcoin in treasury could yield significant returns, bolstering the company‚Äôs financial position. Competitive Edge Being among the first major retailers to adopt Bitcoin payments could give Amazon a competitive edge, setting it apart from other e-commerce platforms and reinforcing its image as an innovator. Risk Mitigation A diversified treasury with Bitcoin holdings could act as a hedge against traditional financial risks, including currency devaluation and economic downturns, ensuring greater financial stability for the company. Challenges and Considerations While the potential benefits are substantial, Amazon would need to navigate several challenges to successfully integrate Bitcoin payments: Regulatory Compliance The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is complex and varies significantly across different jurisdictions. Amazon would need to ensure full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations, including anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) requirements. Volatility of Bitcoin Bitcoin‚Äôs price volatility poses a significant risk for its adoption as a payment method. Fluctuations in value could affect both Amazon and its customers, leading to potential financial losses and dissatisfaction. Infrastructure Development Integrating Bitcoin payments would require substantial investment in infrastructure, including secure payment gateways, digital wallets, and robust cybersecurity measures to protect against fraud and hacking. Public Perception and Trust Building trust among customers regarding the safety and reliability of Bitcoin payments is crucial. Amazon would need to invest in educating consumers about the benefits and risks of using cryptocurrencies. Tax Implications The tax treatment of Bitcoin transactions is another critical consideration. Amazon would need to navigate the complexities of cryptocurrency taxation to avoid legal and financial repercussions. The Role of Think Tanks and Policy Advocacy The involvement of the National Center for Public Policy Research in advocating for Bitcoin treasury strategies underscores the growing influence of think tanks in shaping corporate policies and strategies. Think tanks play a pivotal role in conducting research, providing policy recommendations, and influencing decision-makers in both the public and private sectors. Impact of Policy Advocacy Policy advocacy by think tanks can accelerate the adoption of innovative financial strategies by highlighting the potential benefits and addressing common misconceptions. In this case, the NCPPR‚Äôs proposal to Amazon could serve as a catalyst for a broader acceptance of Bitcoin within corporate treasury management. Collaboration with Corporations Collaboration between think tanks and corporations can lead to the development of well-informed and strategically sound policies. By leveraging the expertise of both entities, companies like Amazon can make more informed decisions regarding the integration of cryptocurrencies into their business models. Comparative Analysis: Amazon vs. Other Tech Giants To contextualize Amazon‚Äôs potential adoption of BTC payments, it is useful to compare it with other tech giants that have embraced cryptocurrencies: Tesla Tesla, under Elon Musk‚Äôs leadership, became one of the first major companies to accept Bitcoin as payment for its electric vehicles. Despite facing regulatory scrutiny and Tesla‚Äôs later reversal of this decision, Tesla‚Äôs initial adoption highlighted the feasibility and benefits of integrating Bitcoin payments into a large-scale business. PayPal PayPal has integrated cryptocurrency services, allowing users to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. PayPal‚Äôs move has made crypto more accessible to mainstream consumers, demonstrating the potential for widespread adoption of digital currencies. Microsoft Microsoft was one of the earliest adopters of Bitcoin, allowing users to purchase Xbox games and other digital content with the cryptocurrency. Although Microsoft later discontinued this option, its initial adoption set a precedent for the use of cryptocurrencies in e-commerce. Lessons for Amazon Amazon can learn from the experiences of these companies by: Ensuring Regulatory Compliance: Navigating the regulatory landscape is crucial for sustainable adoption. Managing Volatility: Implementing measures to mitigate the impact of Bitcoin‚Äôs price volatility. Investing in Infrastructure: Developing robust and secure payment systems to support Bitcoin transactions. Educating Consumers: Building trust through comprehensive customer education and support. Future Implications for the Cryptocurrency Market Amazon‚Äôs potential adoption of Bitcoin payments could have far-reaching implications for the cryptocurrency market: Increased Liquidity Amazon‚Äôs integration of Bitcoin payments would likely increase the liquidity of the cryptocurrency, making it easier to buy, sell, and trade. Higher liquidity can lead to more stable prices and reduced volatility over time. Enhanced Legitimacy Adoption by a major corporation like Amazon would further legitimize Bitcoin, encouraging other businesses to consider similar integrations. This could lead to a virtuous cycle of increased adoption and market growth. Innovation in Payment Technologies Amazon‚Äôs entry into BTC payments could spur innovation in payment technologies, including the development of more secure and efficient cryptocurrency payment systems. This innovation could benefit both consumers and businesses by making digital transactions faster, cheaper, and more secure. Impact on Traditional Financial Systems Widespread adoption of Bitcoin payments by major corporations could challenge traditional financial systems, prompting banks and financial institutions to innovate and adapt to the changing landscape. This could lead to a more integrated and diversified financial ecosystem. Strategic Recommendations for Amazon To successfully integrate Bitcoin payments and capitalize on the potential benefits, Amazon should consider the following strategic recommendations: 1. Develop a Comprehensive Regulatory Strategy Amazon must work closely with legal experts to navigate the complex regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies. This includes ensuring compliance with all relevant laws and regulations, securing necessary licenses, and staying abreast of regulatory changes. 2. Implement Robust Risk Management Practices Given Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility, Amazon should implement robust risk management practices to mitigate potential financial losses. This could include using hedging strategies, setting clear policies for Bitcoin transactions, and limiting exposure to volatile assets. 3. Invest in Secure Payment Infrastructure Amazon should invest in developing secure and efficient payment infrastructure to support Bitcoin transactions. This includes partnering with blockchain technology providers, enhancing cybersecurity measures, and ensuring seamless integration with existing payment systems. 4. Educate Consumers and Employees Building trust and understanding among consumers and employees is crucial for successful adoption. Amazon should invest in comprehensive education programs that inform stakeholders about the benefits, risks, and usage of Bitcoin payments. 5. Foster Partnerships with Crypto Industry Leaders Collaborating with established players in the cryptocurrency industry can provide Amazon with valuable insights and expertise. Partnerships with cryptocurrency exchanges, wallet providers, and blockchain developers can enhance Amazon‚Äôs capabilities in managing Bitcoin payments. 6. Monitor and Adapt to Market Trends The cryptocurrency market is highly dynamic, with frequent technological advancements and regulatory changes. Amazon must continuously monitor market trends, adapt its strategies accordingly, and remain flexible to capitalize on new opportunities. Potential Economic Scenarios Post-Adoption The integration of Bitcoin payments by Amazon could lead to various economic scenarios, each with distinct implications: Scenario 1: Accelerated Crypto Adoption In this optimistic scenario, Amazon‚Äôs adoption of BTC payments accelerates the mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Increased accessibility and convenience lead to higher adoption rates among consumers, driving further investment and market growth. Scenario 2: Regulatory Backlash Should Amazon‚Äôs move face significant regulatory challenges or backlash, it could lead to stricter regulations on cryptocurrency payments. This scenario would require Amazon to adjust its strategies to comply with new regulations, potentially slowing down adoption. Scenario 3: Market Stabilization Amazon‚Äôs adoption could contribute to the stabilization of Bitcoin‚Äôs price by increasing liquidity and reducing volatility. A more stable Bitcoin market would encourage greater confidence and participation from both retail and institutional investors. Scenario 4: Innovation Surge Amazon‚Äôs entry into Bitcoin payments could spur a surge in innovation within the cryptocurrency and fintech sectors. New payment technologies, blockchain applications, and financial products could emerge, enhancing the overall ecosystem. The Broader Context: Cryptocurrency in Global Commerce Amazon‚Äôs potential adoption of Bitcoin payments fits into a broader trend of increasing cryptocurrency integration into global commerce. As digital currencies gain traction, more companies and industries are exploring their use for transactions, investments, and financial management. Cross-Border Transactions Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin facilitate seamless cross-border transactions, reducing the need for intermediaries and lowering transaction costs. This can enhance efficiency and accessibility for both businesses and consumers engaged in international trade. Financial Inclusion Cryptocurrencies have the potential to promote financial inclusion by providing access to financial services for underserved populations. By adopting Bitcoin payments, Amazon can contribute to a more inclusive financial system, enabling more people to participate in the digital economy. Sustainable and Transparent Transactions Blockchain technology, the underlying foundation of Bitcoin, offers transparency and immutability, making transactions more secure and trustworthy. Amazon‚Äôs integration of BTC payments could enhance the transparency and security of its financial operations. Public Opinion and Consumer Behavior The public‚Äôs perception of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency payments plays a crucial role in the success of such initiatives. Understanding and addressing consumer concerns is essential for fostering widespread adoption. Trust and Security Consumers must trust that their Bitcoin transactions are secure and that their personal information is protected. Amazon must ensure that its Bitcoin payment systems are robust, secure, and user-friendly to build and maintain consumer trust. Ease of Use For Bitcoin payments to gain traction, the process must be as seamless and convenient as traditional payment methods. Amazon should prioritize user experience, ensuring that customers can easily and quickly use Bitcoin for their purchases without encountering technical barriers. Awareness and Education Increasing consumer awareness about the benefits and uses of Bitcoin is vital. Amazon can play a role in educating its customers about how to use Bitcoin, the advantages of digital payments, and the measures taken to ensure security and compliance. The Future of Bitcoin in E-Commerce The potential integration of Bitcoin payments by Amazon could pave the way for a broader adoption of cryptocurrencies in e-commerce. This could lead to significant changes in how online transactions are conducted and how digital currencies are perceived by the public. Evolution of Payment Systems Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could drive the evolution of payment systems, leading to more decentralized and efficient financial transactions. This could reduce reliance on traditional banking systems and payment processors, lowering costs and increasing transaction speeds. Integration with Emerging Technologies The adoption of Bitcoin payments could also spur the integration of cryptocurrencies with emerging technologies such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and the Internet of Things (IoT). This integration could create new opportunities for immersive and seamless shopping experiences. Impact on Traditional Financial Institutions As more companies like Amazon adopt Bitcoin payments, traditional financial institutions may need to adapt by offering more cryptocurrency-related services. Banks, payment processors, and other financial entities could develop new products and services to meet the growing demand for digital asset integration. Conclusion The Amazon adopt BTC payments speculation, voiced by former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), highlights the increasing interplay between major tech corporations and the cryptocurrency sector. CZ‚Äôs curiosity about Amazon‚Äôs potential adoption of Bitcoin payments underscores the significance of such a move in legitimizing and mainstreaming digital assets. Following the proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research advocating for a Bitcoin treasury strategy at Amazon‚Äôs April 2025 shareholder meeting, the conversation gains further traction. Amazon‚Äôs potential integration of Bitcoin payments could catalyze widespread crypto adoption, enhance financial inclusion, and drive economic innovation. However, it also presents challenges related to regulatory compliance, market volatility, and infrastructure development. To navigate these complexities successfully, Amazon must implement strategic measures that balance innovation with stability, ensure robust security and compliance, and foster consumer trust through education and seamless user experiences. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, the actions of influential companies like Amazon will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of digital finance. Whether Amazon will ultimately adopt Bitcoin payments remains to be seen, but the ongoing dialogue and strategic proposals signal a significant shift towards greater acceptance and utilization of cryptocurrencies in global commerce.

37425933,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=104307,1733738538,"Shiba Inu Surge Just Beginning, Analysts Say SHIB Looks Insanely Strong","The recent crypto bull market tide appears to lift all boats, including the prominent meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB). Since mid-September 2024, the token has enjoyed a rally that has seen its price surge as much as 153% from about $0.00001317 to as high as $0.00003343. However, several prominent analysts say this over 150% rally may be the tip of the iceberg.""SHIB Looks Insanely Strong""On Saturday, December 7, prominent crypto analyst ""Bluntz"" opined in a post on X that SHIB looked poised to post several price multiple gains.In the same post, the analyst shared a chart setting short-term price targets above $0.00006 and $0.00009, representing over 94% and 191% gains from the token's price of $0.00003089 at the time of writing.Bluntz's set targets are dependent on SHIB repeating a pattern observed in March 2024 when its price shot up to peaks of $0.00004567 from around $0.00000907 after its 14-day RSI broke above 70 and surged over 90. This RSI is currently over the 70 mark again amid the latest rally, with more room for growth.Meanwhile, Bluntz is one of many analysts who have expressed a positive outlook on SHIB in the past few days. On Sunday, ""King's Chart"" asserted that SHIB was ""looking good."" Unlike Bluntz, however, the analyst shared a more conservative 35% price gain prediction that would see the token trade at the $0.00004518 price point, citing a potential breakout of an ascending triangle chart pattern.https://twitter.com/KingsCharts/status/1865611093336568188At the same time, ""CAPT. PARA80LIC TOBELERONE"" shared a parabolic outlook of SHIB that could see the token surge as high as $0.0001 in the coming weeks and hit a peak of $0.0005 in Q1 2025, representing over 220% and 1500% gains from current prices.https://twitter.com/CaptToblerone/status/1865836151350993089These analysts‚Äô views come as some may see an opportunity in SHIB lagging behind other leading meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) despite its recent gains in the broad crypto market rally. For context, while DOGE has been up over 110% in the past 30 days, SHIB has been up only about 60%.¬†These views of SHIB presenting a high return opportunity are further strengthened as the token also has some fundamental factors going for it.Shibarium Recording New MilestonesAs reported by The Crypto Basic on December 7, Shiba Inu's Ethereum Layer 2 Shibarium has recorded several milestones that suggest it is seeing significant interest. For one, wallets on the network have surpassed 2 million. At the same time, total network transactions have surpassed 600 million, with daily transactions sometimes reaching nearly 5 million.This rising interest in Shibarium bodes well for SHIB as the network has an automatic mechanism that burns the token with 70% of network fees.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,DOGE | ETH | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/09/shiba-inu-surge-just-beginning-analysts-say-shib-looks-insanely-strong/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=shiba-inu-surge-just-beginning-analysts-say-shib-looks-insanely-strong,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
37418609,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108290,1733738484,"Analysis: Bitcoin Surge to $104K Spurs Sell-Off, Risks Further Corrections","In a volatile turn of events within the cryptocurrency markets, Bitcoin surge to 104K has ignited significant selling pressure, raising concerns about potential further corrections. On December 5, Bitcoin‚Äôs price soared to an impressive $104,000, a milestone that drew widespread attention from both investors and analysts alike. However, this surge was not without its aftermath, as the rapid climb prompted a wave of sell-offs from both short-term and long-term holders, leading to a sharp decline in Bitcoin‚Äôs value. The Surge to $104,000: What Drove the Price Increase? Bitcoin‚Äôs journey to $104,000 was fueled by a confluence of factors that collectively contributed to its rapid appreciation. Key drivers included: 1. Institutional Adoption Increased institutional interest and investment played a pivotal role in propelling Bitcoin‚Äôs price. Major financial institutions and hedge funds began allocating significant portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, viewing it as a hedge against inflation and a store of value akin to digital gold. 2. Macro-Economic Trends Global economic uncertainties, including rising inflation rates and geopolitical tensions, have driven investors towards Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset. The perception of Bitcoin as a decentralized and limited-supply asset makes it an attractive option amid fiat currency devaluation concerns. 3. Technological Advancements Advancements in blockchain technology and the integration of Bitcoin into mainstream financial systems have enhanced its utility and accessibility. Innovations such as the Lightning Network have improved transaction speeds and reduced fees, making Bitcoin more viable for everyday use. 4. Regulatory Developments Positive regulatory developments, including favorable regulations in key markets and the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, have bolstered investor confidence. Clearer regulatory frameworks reduce uncertainty and encourage more participation from institutional and retail investors. The Sell-Off: Unpacking the Downward Movement Despite the optimistic surge, Bitcoin‚Äôs rapid ascent to $104,000 triggered a significant sell-off, leading to a sharp decline in its price. This sell-off was characterized by: 1. Increased Selling Pressure Both short-term traders and long-term holders began liquidating their positions to capitalize on the price peak. Short-term traders often engage in quick buy-and-sell strategies to exploit price volatility, while long-term holders may sell to realize gains or rebalance their portfolios. 2. Large Transfers from Wallets Data from CryptoQuant‚Äôs contributor XBTManager indicated substantial Bitcoin transfers from exchange wallets. These large movements are indicative of holders moving their assets to exchanges in anticipation of selling, thereby increasing the sell-side liquidity and exerting downward pressure on prices. 3. Market Sentiment Shift The initial excitement surrounding the price surge was tempered by concerns about sustainability and overvaluation. As investors reassessed Bitcoin‚Äôs valuation metrics, fear of missing out (FOMO) gave way to fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), prompting more sell-offs. 4. Automated Selling Mechanisms Smart contracts and automated trading bots can exacerbate price movements. When Bitcoin reaches certain price thresholds, automated sell orders are triggered, amplifying the sell-off and accelerating the price decline. Price Correction and Current Market Dynamics Following the initial sell-off, Bitcoin‚Äôs price dropped sharply to $90,000 before rebounding to $102,000. This fluctuation highlights the ongoing volatility and uncertainty within the cryptocurrency market. However, the market remains wary of sustained upward momentum, as evidenced by continued selling pressure, particularly from long-term investors. 1. Long-Term Investor Activity Long-term holders, often referred to as ‚ÄúHODLers,‚Äù continue to exhibit a cautious stance. While some may rebuy at lower levels, the sustained selling activity suggests a broader expectation of future corrections or consolidations. 2. Technical Indicators Technical analysis points to several key support and resistance levels. The decline to $90,000 tests the lower support zones, while the rebound to $102,000 faces resistance at the previous high. Indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) suggest that Bitcoin remains in a bearish trend, with potential for further corrections. 3. Market Liquidity and Volume Trading volumes remain high, reflecting active participation from both institutional and retail investors. High liquidity can lead to swift price adjustments, making Bitcoin susceptible to rapid movements in either direction based on market sentiment and external factors. Potential Risks and Future Corrections The current market activity, especially among long-term investors, indicates sustained selling pressure, raising the possibility of further price corrections. Several factors contribute to this outlook: 1. Overextension and Bubble Concerns Bitcoin‚Äôs rapid ascent to $104,000 raises concerns about overextension and the formation of a speculative bubble. Historical precedents, such as the 2017 bull run and subsequent crash, highlight the cyclical nature of Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements. 2. Regulatory Uncertainty Despite recent positive regulatory developments, ongoing uncertainties and potential crackdowns in various jurisdictions could negatively impact Bitcoin‚Äôs price. Regulatory actions can create uncertainty, leading to decreased investor confidence and increased sell-offs. 3. Macroeconomic Factors Global economic conditions, including changes in interest rates, inflation trends, and geopolitical tensions, continue to influence Bitcoin‚Äôs price. Adverse macroeconomic developments can trigger risk-off sentiments, prompting investors to liquidate crypto positions in favor of more stable assets. 4. Technological and Security Risks Security breaches, technological vulnerabilities, and scalability issues remain persistent challenges for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Any significant security incidents or failures in Bitcoin‚Äôs underlying technology could erode trust and lead to rapid sell-offs. Strategies for Navigating the Current Market Investors looking to navigate the current Bitcoin market should consider the following strategies: 1. Diversification Diversifying investment portfolios across different asset classes can mitigate risks associated with Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility. Including a mix of traditional assets, such as stocks and bonds, alongside cryptocurrencies can enhance portfolio resilience. 2. Risk Management Implementing robust risk management practices, including setting stop-loss orders and position sizing, can help protect against significant losses. Investors should define their risk tolerance levels and adhere to disciplined trading strategies. 3. Long-Term Perspective Maintaining a long-term investment perspective can help investors weather short-term volatility. Bitcoin has demonstrated substantial growth over extended periods, and long-term holders may benefit from continued adoption and technological advancements. 4. Staying Informed Staying abreast of market developments, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic trends is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Utilizing reliable sources of information and engaging with the crypto community can provide valuable insights into market dynamics. 5. Hedging Strategies Employing hedging strategies, such as using derivatives or holding stablecoins, can provide a buffer against Bitcoin‚Äôs price volatility. These strategies can help manage risk and protect investment portfolios from adverse market movements. Expert Opinions and Analysis 1. Institutional Perspectives Institutional investors remain cautiously optimistic about Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term potential. While they acknowledge the current sell-off and volatility, many believe in Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. Institutional players are likely to continue accumulating Bitcoin during price dips, anticipating future growth. 2. Technical Analysts Technical analysts emphasize the importance of key support and resistance levels in determining Bitcoin‚Äôs future price movements. The $90,000 support level is critical, and a breach could signal further downside. Conversely, sustained trading above $100,000 could indicate a reversal of the bearish trend. 3. Market Sentiment Experts Market sentiment experts highlight the psychological factors driving Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements. The initial surge to $104,000 was fueled by optimistic sentiment and fear of missing out (FOMO), while the subsequent sell-off was driven by fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). Understanding these sentiment shifts is essential for anticipating future price actions. Comparative Analysis: Bitcoin‚Äôs Market Behavior Bitcoin‚Äôs price dynamics exhibit patterns that are both unique and consistent with traditional financial markets. Comparing Bitcoin‚Äôs behavior to other asset classes can provide valuable insights: 1. Stock Market Comparisons Like stocks, Bitcoin is influenced by macroeconomic factors, investor sentiment, and regulatory developments. However, Bitcoin‚Äôs lack of intrinsic value, reliance on speculative interest, and higher volatility set it apart from traditional equities. 2. Gold and Commodities Bitcoin is often compared to gold as a store of value. Both assets share characteristics such as limited supply and decentralized nature. However, Bitcoin offers greater portability and divisibility, making it more accessible for digital transactions. 3. Forex Market Bitcoin operates in a similar vein to the forex market, where exchange rates fluctuate based on supply and demand dynamics. The rise and fall of Bitcoin‚Äôs price against fiat currencies like the USD illustrate its susceptibility to similar market forces. Future Outlook: Bitcoin‚Äôs Path Forward The future of Bitcoin remains a subject of intense debate and speculation. Several scenarios could unfold based on current market trends and external factors: 1. Continued Growth and Adoption Bitcoin could continue its trajectory of growth and adoption, driven by increased institutional investment, technological advancements, and broader acceptance as a legitimate financial asset. In this scenario, Bitcoin‚Äôs price could stabilize and climb to new highs as it integrates further into the global financial system. 2. Market Consolidation and Stability Bitcoin may enter a phase of consolidation, where its price stabilizes within a defined range. This could be achieved through a balance of buying and selling pressures, enhanced by regulatory clarity and improved market infrastructure. 3. Prolonged Bear Market Bitcoin could experience a prolonged bear market if negative factors, such as unfavorable regulatory actions, economic downturns, or significant security breaches, prevail. This scenario would lead to sustained price declines and reduced investor confidence. 4. Technological Innovations Innovations in blockchain technology and the development of layer-two solutions could enhance Bitcoin‚Äôs scalability and transaction efficiency, driving further adoption and potentially boosting its price. Strategic Recommendations for Investors Given the current market dynamics, investors should consider the following strategies to navigate Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility and potential corrections: 1. Diversify Holdings Diversifying investment portfolios to include a mix of cryptocurrencies, traditional assets, and alternative investments can reduce risk exposure. Diversification helps mitigate the impact of significant price movements in any single asset. 2. Employ Dollar-Cost Averaging Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) involves investing a fixed amount of money into Bitcoin at regular intervals, regardless of its price. This strategy reduces the impact of volatility and lowers the average cost per unit over time. 3. Utilize Stop-Loss Orders Setting stop-loss orders can help protect investments by automatically selling Bitcoin when its price reaches a predetermined level. This strategy limits potential losses in the event of a significant price decline. 4. Stay Informed and Adaptive Maintaining an informed perspective on market trends, regulatory developments, and technological advancements is crucial for making strategic investment decisions. Being adaptable and ready to adjust strategies based on new information can enhance investment outcomes. 5. Focus on Long-Term Value Adopting a long-term investment perspective allows investors to ride out short-term volatility and capitalize on Bitcoin‚Äôs potential for substantial long-term gains. Focusing on the fundamental value and future prospects of Bitcoin can lead to more resilient investment strategies. Case Studies: Bitcoin Corrections and Recovery 1. The 2017 Boom and 2018 Crash Bitcoin‚Äôs price surged to nearly $20,000 in late 2017, driven by speculative investment and mainstream media coverage. However, in 2018, the market experienced a significant correction, with prices dropping to around $3,200 by December 2018. This correction underscored the cyclical nature of Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements and the influence of market sentiment. 2. The 2020 Pandemic Surge and 2021 Rally During the COVID-19 pandemic, Bitcoin‚Äôs price experienced substantial growth, reaching an all-time high of over $60,000 in March 2021. This surge was driven by institutional adoption, economic stimulus measures, and growing recognition of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. The subsequent rally solidified Bitcoin‚Äôs position as a mainstream financial asset. 3. The 2023 Regulatory Impact In 2023, regulatory crackdowns in several key markets led to a temporary decline in Bitcoin‚Äôs price. However, the market rebounded as investors adapted to the new regulatory landscape and continued to view Bitcoin as a valuable asset. This case highlights the resilience of Bitcoin despite regulatory challenges. Conclusion The Bitcoin surge to 104K has highlighted the inherent volatility and complex dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. While the ascent to $104,000 demonstrated Bitcoin‚Äôs potential for rapid growth and significant returns, the subsequent sell-off and price correction underscored the risks associated with such volatile assets. Ongoing market activity, particularly among long-term investors, suggests that selling pressure remains a persistent factor, posing the potential for further price corrections. Investors must navigate these fluctuations with a strategic approach, emphasizing diversification, risk management, and a long-term perspective. Staying informed about market trends, regulatory developments, and technological advancements is essential for making informed investment decisions in this dynamic landscape. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a leading digital asset remains both promising and challenging. Balancing the opportunities for substantial gains with the risks of significant corrections will be crucial for investors seeking to capitalize on Bitcoin‚Äôs potential while safeguarding their investments against volatility.

The analyst highlighted that last cycle, the price faced rejection around the 0.786 Fibonacci level (log scale) before pulling back and consolidating at the 0.618 level for approximately four weeks. This time, however, Dogecoin appears to be sustaining price action above the 0.786 log Fibonacci level without a deeper correction. According to Cantonese Cat, ‚ÄúSo far we‚Äôre above the 0.786.

Accordingly, the shareholder proposal included the following statements: ‚ÄúWhile Bitcoin is currently a volatile asset (Amazon stock has been volatile throughout its history), companies have a responsibility to maximize shareholder value both in the long term and the short term.

Santana highlights that Shiba Inu has recently broken out of a long-term descending triangle pattern, a bullish signal for the asset. He further notes that the breakout has been supported by increased trading volume, indicating growing market interest. Projected Growth According to Santana‚Äôs projections, Shiba Inu could achieve substantial gains from its current position.

Bitcoin (BTC), the undisputed leader of the cryptocurrency world, has maintained its position as the most trusted digital asset. As the dominant store of value, BTC remains the go-to choice for institutional investors, with its recent run to an ATH of $103,900 underscoring why it is regarded as digital gold. The Spotlight Turns to Altcoins The crypto scene is often accompanied by optimistic phrases such as ‚ÄúWhen Lambo?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhen Moon?‚Äù referring to the eager anticipation of crypto holders for the time the market finally breaks out and delivers long-awaited gains. Crypto enthusiasts have waited years and years for this to happen and are continuously searching for a project to reap the rewards of the highly anticipated breakout. BTC finally broke out to surge above the all-important $100,000 level. While BTC leads the charge and sets the pace for the rest of the market, we have seen many projects surpass Bitcoin‚Äôs growth, with this number increasing daily. Bitcoin will forever remain the G.O.A.T (Greatest of All Time), the OG crypto held in the highest esteem, but altcoins are more likely to deliver more significant gains as we near the altcoin season. Some of the biggest altcoin opportunities include the ever-popular Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe (PEPE), and the latest newcomer from the Solana network, Husky Inu (HINU) . Ethereum (ETH) Gains Significant Ground Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, has shown signs of relative weakness in recent months but witnessed significant gains after BTC set its new ETH. Ethereum is the backbone of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts but has struggled with declining network activity, increasing its vulnerability compared to BTC. Despite the hype around Ethereum (ETH)‚Äôs newly adopted PoS system, the demand for its blockchain services has stagnated. Lower gas fees, while beneficial for users, have reduced the income for miners and validators and impacted ETH's price. Moreover, the supply of ETH has increased, creating further pressure on the asset's value. ETH‚Äôs price battled to stay afloat as investors turned to other altcoin opportunities but finally regained some ground. ETH turned a corner after BTC‚Äôs incredible run, breaking through the crucial $4,000 mark, gaining over 26% in the past month. At the time of writing, ETH traded around the $3,854 mark. Dogecoin (DOGE) Maintains its Recent Gains Dogecoin (DOGE) is the largest memecoin by market cap and is the 7th¬†largest crypto with a market cap exceeding $63.3 billion. Elon Musk, the world‚Äôs richest man with a net worth exceeding $354 billion, is the CEO of Tesla, owner of social media platform X (formerly Twitter), and one of the president-elect‚Äôs most prominent supporters and has long endorsed Dogecoin . Musk recently joined the Trump campaign and was integral to Trump‚Äôs victory, and his involvement with the republican party could see DOGE run to new highs in the coming months.¬†DOGE‚Äôs surge stepped into overdrive after Donald Trump released a statement revealing that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. According to Trump, DOGE will pave the way for his administration to ‚Äúdismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditure, and restructure Federal Agencies ‚Äì Essential to the ‚ÄúSave America‚Äù Movement.‚Äù DOGE is expected to surge after DeFi Technologies introduced Valour Dogecoin (DOGE) ETP on Sweden‚Äôs Spotlight Stock Market. The ETP will allow retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to DOGE without directly owning the asset. Amid Dogecoin‚Äôs increasing popularity and momentum, the token managed to flip luxury car maker Porsche‚Äôs market cap. With its increased market cap, Dogecoin surpassed Porsche‚Äôs $56.1 billion market capitalization. DOGE gained over 104% over the past month and has managed to hold on to most of the gains despite a slight market correction. Pepe (PEPE) Surges Over 122% in the Past Month Pepe¬†(PEPE) is a fan favourite among crypto investors, with a staggering 1,395%¬†gain in the past year.

37418441,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108332,1733738139,"Analysis: Bitcoin‚Äôs Surge to $104K Spurs Sell-Off, Risks Further Corrections","In the volatile realm of cryptocurrency markets, metrics such as the Altcoin Season Index serve as essential tools for gauging market sentiment and performance trends. On December 9, 2024, at 00:56 UTC, the Altcoin Season Index, monitored by CoinMarketCap (CMC), decreased by one point to reach 81. Despite this slight drop, the index firmly places the market within an Altcoin Season , indicating that the majority of altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. This analysis delves into the implications of this metric, the factors driving current market trends, and what it means for investors and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index is a specialized metric designed to measure the performance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin. By excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, the index focuses on the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization as listed on CoinMarketCap. It evaluates their performance over the past 90 days, comparing it to Bitcoin‚Äôs performance. The index ranges from 1 to 100, with the following key indicators: Altcoin Season: When the index is above 75, indicating that at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin. Bitcoin Season: When the index is 25 or below, meaning that 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have underperformed Bitcoin. Currently, with an index score of 81 , the market is in a strong Altcoin Season , signifying robust performance by the majority of altcoins compared to Bitcoin. Implications of the Altcoin Season Index at 81 1. Market Sentiment Shift An index of 81 reflects a significant shift in market sentiment towards altcoins. Investors are showing increased confidence in a diverse range of cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin, indicating a broader belief in the potential of these digital assets. This shift suggests a maturation of the cryptocurrency market, where investors are looking to diversify their holdings rather than relying solely on Bitcoin as a store of value. 2. Investment Diversification The high Altcoin Season Index encourages investors to diversify their portfolios by allocating more funds to altcoins. Diversification is a fundamental investment strategy aimed at reducing risk by spreading investments across various assets. In the context of cryptocurrencies, this means holding a mix of Bitcoin and altcoins, each with different use cases, technological innovations, and market potentials. By doing so, investors can capitalize on the growth of multiple projects and mitigate the impact of volatility in any single asset. 3. Altcoin Development and Innovation A favorable Altcoin Season Index can act as a catalyst for further development and innovation within the altcoin space. Developers and project teams are incentivized to introduce new features, improve scalability, and enhance security to attract and retain investors. This competitive environment fosters innovation, leading to the creation of more robust and versatile cryptocurrencies that can address a wider range of use cases and challenges. 4. Impact on Bitcoin While Bitcoin remains the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, its relative performance may be subdued during an Altcoin Season. Investors might seek higher returns from altcoins, leading to short-term price corrections for Bitcoin. However, Bitcoin‚Äôs fundamental value as a decentralized store of value and its dominance in the market may continue to support its long-term stability and growth. Key Players Driving the Altcoin Season Several altcoins are likely contributing to the strong performance indicated by the Altcoin Season Index. These include established projects as well as emerging ones that have gained significant traction. 1. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum continues to be a dominant force in the cryptocurrency space, driven by its robust smart contract platform and the expansion of decentralized applications (dApps). The successful rollout of Ethereum 2.0, aimed at improving scalability and reducing energy consumption, has bolstered investor confidence. Additionally, the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum network has contributed to its strong performance. 2. Binance Coin (BNB) Binance Coin, the native cryptocurrency of the Binance exchange, remains a key player in the market. BNB‚Äôs utility extends beyond the Binance ecosystem, including transaction fee discounts, participation in token sales, and use in various dApps. Its strong performance is supported by Binance‚Äôs continuous expansion and the growing adoption of its decentralized exchange (DEX). 3. Cardano (ADA) Cardano‚Äôs focus on academic research and peer-reviewed protocols has positioned it as a strong contender in the smart contract space. Recent developments, such as partnerships with educational institutions and the launch of new decentralized applications, have enhanced its appeal to investors seeking long-term value. 4. Solana (SOL) Solana‚Äôs high-performance blockchain, known for its scalability and low transaction costs, attracts projects and developers aiming to build efficient dApps. Solana‚Äôs growing ecosystem, driven by initiatives in DeFi, NFTs, and Web3, contributes to its robust market performance. 5. Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot‚Äôs interoperability features, enabling different blockchains to communicate and share information, have made it a valuable asset in the multi-chain future of blockchain technology. Its parachain auctions and growing ecosystem of projects add to its strong performance in the market. 6. Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche‚Äôs consensus mechanism, which offers high throughput and low latency, has attracted numerous projects looking for scalable and efficient blockchain solutions. The platform‚Äôs focus on DeFi and institutional adoption further supports its market performance. Market Trends and Analysis Increased Participation in DeFi and NFTs The surge in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has significantly boosted altcoin performance. Platforms enabling DeFi services and NFT marketplaces attract substantial investment, driving demand for their native tokens. The continued innovation in these sectors, including the development of more sophisticated financial instruments and digital art platforms, fuels investor interest and capital inflows. Regulatory Developments Positive regulatory developments play a crucial role in enhancing investor confidence. Clearer regulations and favorable policies in key markets reduce uncertainty, encouraging more participation from institutional and retail investors. For instance, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs and the establishment of regulatory frameworks for DeFi projects contribute to the overall bullish sentiment in the altcoin market. Technological Advancements Continuous technological advancements and the introduction of innovative features by altcoin projects enhance their utility and attractiveness. Improvements in scalability, security, and interoperability drive their adoption and market performance. Projects that successfully implement cutting-edge technologies and address existing limitations of blockchain systems are more likely to outperform, contributing to the Altcoin Season Index. Macro-Economic Factors Global economic conditions, including inflation rates, interest rates, and geopolitical tensions, influence cryptocurrency markets. In times of economic uncertainty, investors may turn to cryptocurrencies as a hedge against traditional financial risks. The decentralized and limited-supply nature of many altcoins positions them as attractive alternatives to fiat currencies and traditional investment vehicles. Community and Ecosystem Growth A strong and active community is essential for the success of any cryptocurrency project. Projects with vibrant developer communities, active social media engagement, and continuous ecosystem development are better positioned to sustain their growth and performance. The growth of partnerships, collaborations, and integrations with other blockchain projects also contributes to the overall strength of the altcoin market. Potential Risks and Considerations Market Volatility While Altcoin Seasons can offer lucrative opportunities, they also come with heightened volatility. Rapid price movements can lead to significant gains but also substantial losses, particularly for newer or less established projects. Investors must navigate these fluctuations with a strategic approach, emphasizing diversification, risk management, and a long-term perspective. Regulatory Uncertainty Despite recent positive regulatory developments, uncertainty remains a key risk factor. Regulatory crackdowns or unfavorable policies in major markets can negatively impact altcoin performance and investor sentiment. Projects operating in regions with stringent regulations may face operational challenges, limiting their growth potential. Project Sustainability The long-term success of altcoins depends on their ability to deliver on promises, maintain active development, and adapt to market changes. Projects lacking in sustainability or failing to innovate may underperform or collapse, affecting the overall index. Investors should conduct thorough due diligence, assessing the fundamentals, development roadmap, and community support of each project. Technological Risks Blockchain technology, while revolutionary, is not without its challenges. Issues such as scalability, security vulnerabilities, and interoperability limitations can hinder the growth and adoption of altcoin projects. Projects must continuously address these technological challenges to remain competitive and attractive to investors. Liquidity Constraints Liquidity is a crucial factor for the smooth functioning of cryptocurrency markets. Low liquidity can lead to significant price swings and increased volatility, making it difficult for investors to enter or exit positions without impacting the market. Projects with limited trading volumes may struggle to sustain their price levels during periods of high volatility. Future Outlook As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, the dynamics between Bitcoin and altcoins are likely to evolve. The current Altcoin Season , indicated by an index of 81, suggests a period of growth and opportunity for altcoins. However, maintaining this momentum requires continued innovation, effective risk management, and favorable market conditions. Potential Developments Enhanced Interoperability: Projects focused on improving interoperability between different blockchains can drive the adoption of altcoins by facilitating seamless asset transfers and communication across networks. Integration with Traditional Finance: Bridging the gap between decentralized finance and traditional financial systems can enhance the utility and acceptance of altcoins. Partnerships with financial institutions, the introduction of crypto-backed financial products, and regulatory clarity can foster greater integration. Sustainability Initiatives: Addressing environmental concerns through energy-efficient consensus mechanisms and sustainable practices can enhance the appeal of altcoins, particularly among environmentally conscious investors. Technological Innovations The ongoing advancements in blockchain technology will continue to shape the future of altcoins. Innovations such as layer-two scaling solutions, decentralized governance models, and advanced smart contract capabilities can address existing limitations and unlock new use cases. Projects that successfully implement these innovations are likely to outperform, contributing to the sustained growth of the Altcoin Season Index. Market Consolidation As the market evolves, we may witness a consolidation of altcoins, where only the strongest projects survive and thrive. This process can lead to the elimination of weaker projects, thereby strengthening the overall quality and reliability of the altcoin market. Investors should remain vigilant, focusing on projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and supportive communities. Institutional Involvement Increased involvement from institutional investors can further drive the growth of altcoins. Institutions bring significant capital, expertise, and credibility to the market, contributing to the stability and maturity of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As more institutions allocate funds to altcoins, the market may experience enhanced liquidity, reduced volatility, and sustained upward momentum. Strategic Recommendations for Investors Given the current market dynamics, investors looking to capitalize on the Altcoin Season should consider the following strategies: 1. Diversify Holdings Diversification is a fundamental investment strategy aimed at reducing risk by spreading investments across various assets. In the context of cryptocurrencies, this means holding a mix of Bitcoin and altcoins, each with different use cases, technological innovations, and market potentials. By diversifying, investors can capitalize on the growth of multiple projects and mitigate the impact of volatility in any single asset. 2. Conduct Thorough Due Diligence Before investing in any altcoin, investors should conduct thorough due diligence. This involves assessing the project‚Äôs fundamentals, including its use case, development roadmap, team expertise, community support, and partnerships. Understanding the project‚Äôs value proposition and its potential to address real-world problems can help investors make informed decisions. 3. Implement Risk Management Practices Effective risk management is crucial in navigating the high volatility of cryptocurrency markets. Investors should set clear investment goals, define their risk tolerance levels, and implement strategies such as stop-loss orders and position sizing to protect against significant losses. Diversifying investments across different assets can also help manage risk. 4. Stay Informed and Adaptive The cryptocurrency market is highly dynamic, with frequent technological advancements, regulatory changes, and market developments. Investors should stay informed about the latest news, trends, and updates in the market. This can involve following reputable news sources, engaging with the crypto community, and monitoring key metrics and indicators that influence market performance. 5. Adopt a Long-Term Perspective Adopting a long-term investment perspective can help investors weather short-term volatility and capitalize on Bitcoin‚Äôs potential for substantial long-term gains. Focusing on the fundamental value and future prospects of cryptocurrencies can lead to more resilient investment strategies. 6. Leverage Dollar-Cost Averaging Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) involves investing a fixed amount of money into Bitcoin or altcoins at regular intervals, regardless of their price. This strategy reduces the impact of volatility and lowers the average cost per unit over time, making it a disciplined approach to building a diversified cryptocurrency portfolio. 7. Explore Hedging Strategies Hedging strategies, such as using derivatives or holding stablecoins, can provide a buffer against Bitcoin‚Äôs price volatility. These strategies allow investors to manage risk and stabilize returns, even in volatile market conditions. Historical Context: Growth of Bitcoin and Altcoins To fully appreciate the current Altcoin Season, it‚Äôs essential to revisit the historical growth of Bitcoin and altcoins and their impact on the cryptocurrency market. Early Developments Bitcoin, introduced in 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, was the first cryptocurrency to successfully implement decentralized digital currency. It laid the foundation for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem, demonstrating the feasibility of peer-to-peer digital transactions without the need for intermediaries. The introduction of Bitcoin spurred the creation of numerous altcoins, each aiming to address perceived limitations of Bitcoin or to serve specific use cases. Early altcoins like Litecoin (LTC) focused on improving transaction speeds, while others like Ethereum (ETH) introduced smart contract functionality, enabling the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and the proliferation of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Milestones in ETF Growth Over the past few years, Bitcoin ETFs have been a significant milestone in the mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. An ETF, or Exchange-Traded Fund, allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This financial instrument bridges the gap between traditional finance and the crypto market, making it easier for institutional and retail investors to participate. The approval and launch of Bitcoin ETFs by major financial institutions have been pivotal in enhancing Bitcoin‚Äôs liquidity and legitimizing its status as a financial asset. These developments have contributed to the growing investor confidence in Bitcoin, supporting its price growth and adoption. Current Position in the Market Today, Bitcoin remains the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, serving as a benchmark for the broader crypto market. Its influence extends beyond its price movements, impacting the development and performance of altcoins. The continued growth and adoption of Bitcoin provide a solid foundation for the expansion of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. The current Altcoin Season , with an index of 81, reflects a robust performance by altcoins, signaling a period of diversification and growth in the cryptocurrency market. This trend underscores the maturation of the market, where investors are increasingly looking beyond Bitcoin to explore the potential of a diverse range of digital assets. The Role of Institutional and Retail Investors Institutional Investors Institutional investors, including hedge funds, asset managers, and publicly traded companies, have become increasingly significant players in the cryptocurrency market. Their involvement brings substantial capital, stability, and credibility to the market, influencing price dynamics and driving adoption. Institutions view cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and select altcoins, as viable investment assets that offer diversification and potential hedging against traditional financial risks. Their strategic investments contribute to increased liquidity and market depth, supporting sustained growth and stability. Retail Investors Retail investors continue to play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency market, driven by the accessibility and potential for high returns. The proliferation of user-friendly trading platforms and mobile applications has made it easier for individual investors to participate in the market. Retail investors contribute to market liquidity and volatility, often driving short-term price movements through trading activities. Their sentiment and behavior, influenced by news, social media, and market trends, significantly impact the performance of cryptocurrencies. Balancing Institutional and Retail Interests The interplay between institutional and retail investors shapes the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. While institutions bring stability and long-term investment perspectives, retail investors add liquidity and contribute to the market‚Äôs vibrancy. Understanding the motivations and behaviors of both groups is essential for comprehending market trends and predicting future performance.

An index above 75 indicates an Altcoin Season, while an index below 25 signifies a Bitcoin Season. Bitcoin Dominance: Represents Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization relative to the total cryptocurrency market cap. A high Bitcoin Dominance indicates that Bitcoin is the leading force in the market, while a lower dominance suggests increased altcoin activity. Both metrics offer valuable insights, but they focus on different aspects of the market. The Altcoin Season Index provides a more granular view of altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin, while Bitcoin Dominance offers a broader perspective on Bitcoin‚Äôs influence within the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Altcoin Season Index vs. Market Capitalization Trends While the Altcoin Season Index focuses on performance relative to Bitcoin, Market Capitalization Trends track the total value of all cryptocurrencies in the market. An increasing market cap generally indicates growing investor interest and adoption, while a declining market cap can signal waning confidence or market corrections. Combining insights from both the Altcoin Season Index and market capitalization trends can provide a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics, helping investors make more informed decisions. Altcoin Season Index vs. On-Chain Metrics On-Chain Metrics such as transaction volume, active addresses, and network hash rate offer insights into the underlying activity and health of blockchain networks. While the Altcoin Season Index measures performance relative to Bitcoin, on-chain metrics assess the actual usage and engagement with cryptocurrencies. Integrating data from the Altcoin Season Index with on-chain metrics can provide a holistic view of both market performance and network activity, enhancing the accuracy of market assessments and predictions. Community and Ecosystem Growth A strong and active community is essential for the success of any cryptocurrency project. Projects with vibrant developer communities, active social media engagement, and continuous ecosystem development are better positioned to sustain their growth and performance. Developer Engagement Active developer communities contribute to the continuous improvement and innovation of cryptocurrency projects. Regular updates, new feature releases, and the development of dApps and other tools enhance the utility and attractiveness of altcoins, driving their performance and adoption. Social Media and Community Support Social media platforms, forums, and online communities play a crucial role in fostering engagement and support for cryptocurrency projects. Positive community sentiment can drive investor confidence, while active discussions and collaborations can lead to the discovery of new opportunities and use cases. Partnerships and Collaborations Strategic partnerships and collaborations with other blockchain projects, financial institutions, and technology companies can enhance the credibility and reach of altcoins. These alliances facilitate the integration of new technologies, expand market access, and create synergistic opportunities for growth.

37420309,https://invezz.com/?p=2379252,1733738023,Cardano price prediction: is ADA primed for a correction when it hits $2? Polygon and viral $0.125 token headed for triple-digit gains,"Cardano‚Äôs ADA has risen to new highs and garnered global interest. People are speculating on its possibility of reaching above $2. Given market conditions and technical signals, ADA may fall before rising to its all-time high. Meanwhile, Polygon (POL) and Rexas Finance (RXS), a viral $0.125 token, are heading for triple-digit gains after stellar performances in recent weeks. Cardano price prediction: path to $2 and the likely correction From a low of $0.32 to a height of $1.20, ADA climbed 275% over the past month. Cardano‚Äôs ecosystem improvements, rising whale activity, trading volumes, and general crypto market momentum account for this leap. Due to its impressive performance, analysts have concluded that ADA will reach $2 in the coming weeks. On-chain indicators show large investors accumulating 10 million to 100 million ADA tokens. This has raised the price, signaling strong confidence in Cardano. The token broke through critical resistance, contributing to the recent rise. For instance, the ADA recently broke the $1.15 barrier. It then rose above this level, confirming a new support level for the upward trend. However, once ADA touches the $2 mark, analysts predict a 10-15% dip before continuing its rise. The retreat should solidify current gains and spark a longer-term surge. This setback may make ADA soar beyond its all-time high of $3.10, eliminating panic selling. ADA is down 2% in 24 hours to $1.20 as of this report. Despite the seemingly impressive performances, savvy investors are accumulating more of these two ADA alternatives, Rexas Finance and Polygon, for triple-digit gains in the coming weeks. Rexas Finance (RXS): a crypto to watch for triple-digit gains Rexas Finance is another cryptocurrency project with huge development potential. The blockchain-tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) platform has a strong presence in DeFi. Rexas Finance hopes to make previously illiquid assets like real estate, commodities, and art more liquid through tokenization and fractional ownership. It offers regular inventors a low-entry opportunity to enter the trillion-dollar RWA market. The ongoing RXS presale has seen notable success. RXS tokens cost $0.125 in stage 9 of the presale, which began on September 8. The presale has raised $22.7 million and sold 302 million tokens. Once the presale stages are finally completed, the RXS token will debut on at least three of the top 10 exchanges globally. Analysts believe this mega listing will put RXS on course for a notable price gain, with a triple-digit gain being the start of something bigger. Rexas Finance‚Äôs ecosystem highlights its innovative and user-centric approach to tokenization. The Rexas Token Builder lets users develop and deploy tokens without coding, while Rexas GenAI is revolutionizing the NFT market by letting designers create AI-powered digital artworks. Another unique feature is the decentralized Rexas Launchpad for startup fundraising. The ecosystem‚Äôs security focus also attracts investors. Certik audits ensure the platform‚Äôs smart contracts and protocols are secure. Rexas Finance just passed one. Meanwhile, after securing placement on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, the RXS token is easily trackable, providing more transparency about its potential. Rexas Finance poses to be the next big project in the crypto market, and its broad market scope and upcoming exchange listing only add to its flare. Having already delivered a three-digit gain in its ongoing presale when its price rose over 300% from $0.03 to $0.125, the upcoming events make replicating that feat quite easily achievable. Polygon price: a triple-digit potential surge Polygon (POL) has performed well in the cryptocurrency market in recent weeks. POL‚Äôs price rose 150% in 30 days, from $0.29 to $0.75. Experts foresee sustained growth through December as the token consolidates around $0.71. The expansion of the Ethereum ecosystem drives Polygon‚Äôs market success. Polygon, Ethereum‚Äôs Layer 2 scaling solution, is expanding as Ethereum-based dApps and smart contracts gain appeal. Because Polygon offers quicker and less expensive transactions, Ethereum developers seeking scalability prefer Polygon. Meanwhile, POL trading patterns show steady purchasing pressure, with tokens steadily increasing, showing market interest rather than speculation. On-chain metrics further show increased active wallet addresses and daily transactions, reflecting a rising user base and network activity. As of this writing, POL trades at $0.70, up 10% in the past day. It is in a geometric growth phase and might reach triple-digit gains in the coming weeks. Analysts estimate a notable uptick to $2 in the remaining days of December. Cardano‚Äôs (ADA) rise to $2 appears to be stalling, but following this consolidation period, ADA may rally to its all-time high with renewed vigor. Rexas Finance (RXS), a new cryptocurrency project known for its revolutionary asset tokenization approach, may soon reach triple-digit growth with strong presale performance. Rexas Finance, a new cryptocurrency project, may appeal to investors looking for the next big thing. A growing ecosystem and strong financial backing will propel RXS‚Äôs expansion in 2024.

37418296,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108380,1733737792,Analyst Says Likelihood of BTC Reaching $150K by January Next Year is Low,"In the ever-volatile landscape of cryptocurrency markets, predictions about price movements can sway investor sentiment and influence trading behaviors significantly. Recently, Sean Dawson , the head of research at decentralized finance (DeFi) derivatives protocol Derive , provided a cautious outlook on Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) potential to reach the $150,000 mark by January 31, 2025. According to Decrypt , Dawson assigned a 6% probability to Bitcoin surpassing $150,000 and a 10.5% chance for Ethereum (ETH) reaching $6,000 within the same timeframe. This analysis delves into Dawson‚Äôs reasoning, the factors affecting BTC‚Äôs price trajectory, and the broader implications for investors and the cryptocurrency market. Understanding the Analyst‚Äôs Perspective Sean Dawson‚Äôs Role and Expertise As the head of research at Derive , Sean Dawson is deeply entrenched in the world of DeFi and cryptocurrency derivatives. His expertise lies in analyzing market trends, assessing risk factors, and forecasting price movements based on quantitative and qualitative data. Dawson‚Äôs insights are highly regarded within the crypto community, making his cautious stance on Bitcoin‚Äôs near-term price projection noteworthy. The Probability Assessment Dawson‚Äôs assessment assigns a 6% probability to Bitcoin reaching $150,000 and a 10.5% chance for Ethereum attaining $6,000 by January 31, 2025. These figures suggest a low likelihood of both cryptocurrencies hitting these price points within the specified period, indicating a more conservative market outlook. The Mechanics Behind the Probability 25-Delta Skew: An Indicator of Market Sentiment A key element in Dawson‚Äôs analysis is the 25-delta skew , a term borrowed from options trading that refers to the difference in implied volatility between out-of-the-money (OTM) put and call options with a 25 delta. In simpler terms, it measures traders‚Äô expectations about the probability of price movements in a specific direction. Stable 25-Delta Skew: Dawson noted that the 25-delta skew has remained stable since the previous week. This stability indicates that traders‚Äô expectations regarding Bitcoin‚Äôs price direction haven‚Äôt significantly shifted. A stable skew suggests a balanced sentiment, where neither extreme optimism (greed) nor pessimism (fear) is prevalent among traders. Market Consolidation Dawson mentioned that the market appears to be consolidating , a phase where the price of an asset trades within a narrow range without establishing a clear upward or downward trend. Market consolidation often precedes significant price movements, as it indicates a period of balance between buying and selling pressures. Implications of Consolidation: During consolidation, the market lacks the momentum needed to push prices significantly higher or lower. For Bitcoin, this means that without new catalysts or changes in investor sentiment, the path to $150K remains challenging. Factors Influencing Bitcoin‚Äôs Price Outlook Several factors contribute to the analyst‚Äôs low probability assessment for Bitcoin reaching $150K by early 2025. Understanding these factors provides a clearer picture of the challenges and dynamics at play. 1. Macroeconomic Conditions Inflation and Interest Rates Global economic conditions, particularly inflation rates and interest rate policies, play a pivotal role in cryptocurrency valuations. High inflation can drive interest in Bitcoin as a hedge against currency devaluation, while rising interest rates can make traditional investments like bonds more attractive, diverting capital away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Current Scenario: With inflation rates fluctuating and central banks around the world adjusting interest rates to manage economic stability, Bitcoin‚Äôs attractiveness as a hedge is being tested. If inflation stabilizes or decreases, the impetus for investors to seek refuge in Bitcoin may wane. Economic Uncertainty Geopolitical tensions, economic sanctions, and other forms of economic uncertainty can influence investor behavior. In times of instability, Bitcoin may be seen as a safe-haven asset, potentially driving its price upward. Conversely, periods of economic stability might reduce the urgency for such investments. 2. Regulatory Environment Increased Scrutiny As cryptocurrencies gain mainstream attention, regulatory bodies are intensifying their scrutiny. Regulations concerning anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC), and the classification of cryptocurrencies as securities or commodities are evolving. Impact on Bitcoin: Stricter regulations can impede the ease with which institutional and retail investors can participate in Bitcoin markets. Potential regulatory clampdowns can lead to reduced demand and lower price projections. Global Regulatory Divergence Different countries adopt varying regulatory stances on Bitcoin, leading to a fragmented global market. While some regions embrace cryptocurrencies with favorable policies, others impose restrictive measures, affecting overall market sentiment and liquidity. 3. Market Sentiment and Psychological Factors Fear and Greed The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a widely used indicator of market sentiment. Currently, the index stands at 78 , placing it in the ‚ÄòExtreme Greed‚Äô zone. This suggests a highly optimistic market sentiment, which can sometimes lead to overvaluation and increased volatility. Dawson‚Äôs Take: Despite the extreme greed, Dawson‚Äôs analysis indicates that this sentiment may not be sustainable in the long term, especially without significant positive catalysts to drive prices higher. Investor Behavior Retail and institutional investor behaviors significantly impact Bitcoin‚Äôs price. High levels of speculation and herd mentality can drive rapid price movements, while more cautious or strategic investment approaches can stabilize the market. 4. Technological Developments and Adoption Bitcoin‚Äôs Technological Evolution Technological advancements within the Bitcoin network, such as the implementation of the Lightning Network for faster and cheaper transactions, can enhance Bitcoin‚Äôs utility and scalability. However, slow adoption or technical challenges can hinder these benefits from translating into price gains. Integration with Financial Systems Bitcoin‚Äôs integration into traditional financial systems, including acceptance by major payment processors and financial institutions, can drive adoption and price appreciation. Limited integration slows down mainstream acceptance, affecting price growth potential. 5. Supply Dynamics Bitcoin Halving Events Bitcoin undergoes halving events approximately every four years, reducing the reward for mining new blocks by half. This event decreases the rate at which new Bitcoin is introduced into the market, potentially driving up prices due to reduced supply. Upcoming Halving: The next halving is expected to occur in 2024. While historical halvings have led to price surges, Dawson‚Äôs cautious outlook suggests that other factors may counterbalance the reduced supply‚Äôs positive impact. Institutional Holdings Large-scale purchases by institutional investors, such as ETFs and investment funds, can drive demand and increase Bitcoin‚Äôs price. Dawson‚Äôs low probability assessment indicates that, despite some institutional interest, it may not be sufficient to propel Bitcoin to $150K by January next year. Comparative Analysis: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum While Dawson‚Äôs analysis focuses primarily on Bitcoin, he also provides insights into Ethereum‚Äôs (ETH) price outlook, assigning a 10.5% probability of ETH reaching $6,000 by January 31, 2025. Comparing Bitcoin and Ethereum‚Äôs trajectories offers a broader perspective on the cryptocurrency market‚Äôs dynamics. Ethereum‚Äôs Growth Drivers Smart Contracts and DeFi: Ethereum‚Äôs robust smart contract capabilities make it the backbone of the DeFi ecosystem, driving demand for ETH. Ethereum 2.0 Upgrades: Enhancements in scalability, security, and energy efficiency through Ethereum 2.0 can attract more developers and investors, potentially boosting ETH‚Äôs price. NFT Market: The non-fungible token (NFT) market, heavily reliant on Ethereum, continues to expand, supporting increased usage and demand for ETH. Challenges for Ethereum Competition: Emerging smart contract platforms like Solana, Cardano, and Avalanche pose competition, potentially diluting Ethereum‚Äôs market share. Scalability Issues: Despite upgrades, Ethereum‚Äôs scalability challenges can impede its ability to handle increasing transaction volumes efficiently. Regulatory Concerns: As with Bitcoin, regulatory uncertainties around securities classification and AML/KYC compliance can affect Ethereum‚Äôs adoption and price. Implications for Investors Strategic Investment Approaches Given Dawson‚Äôs conservative outlook, investors may consider the following strategies to navigate the current market dynamics: Diversification: Spreading investments across a variety of assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, traditional stocks, bonds, and other cryptocurrencies, can mitigate risks associated with volatility. Risk Management: Implementing stop-loss orders, setting clear investment goals, and maintaining a balanced portfolio can help manage potential downturns. Long-Term Perspective: Focusing on long-term growth rather than short-term price movements can provide more stable returns and reduce the impact of market volatility. Monitoring Market Indicators Investors should closely monitor key market indicators, including: Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Understanding market sentiment can inform investment decisions and timing. Regulatory Developments: Staying informed about changes in cryptocurrency regulations can help anticipate market shifts. Technological Advancements: Tracking updates and improvements in blockchain technology can highlight potential growth opportunities. Hedging Strategies To protect against potential downturns, investors may consider hedging strategies, such as: Stablecoins: Allocating a portion of the portfolio to stablecoins can provide a hedge against The Broader Market Context Institutional Adoption and Its Impact Institutional adoption remains a critical factor influencing Bitcoin‚Äôs price trajectory. As more institutional players enter the market, the dynamics shift, introducing both stability and new risks. Increased Liquidity: Institutional investments inject significant liquidity into the market, reducing price volatility and enhancing market stability. Credibility and Trust: Institutional participation lends credibility to Bitcoin, attracting more retail investors and fostering broader acceptance. Market Influence: Large institutional holders can influence market trends and price movements through their investment decisions and strategies. Technological Innovations and Developments Bitcoin‚Äôs technological landscape is continuously evolving, with innovations aimed at improving its scalability, security, and usability. Lightning Network: This layer-two solution facilitates faster and cheaper transactions, enhancing Bitcoin‚Äôs practicality for everyday use. Taproot Upgrade: The recent Taproot upgrade enhances Bitcoin‚Äôs privacy, scalability, and smart contract capabilities, potentially increasing its appeal to developers and investors. Environmental Concerns: Addressing Bitcoin‚Äôs energy consumption through sustainable mining practices and renewable energy integration is crucial for its long-term viability and acceptance. Global Economic Factors Global economic conditions, including macroeconomic trends, geopolitical tensions, and economic policies, play a significant role in shaping Bitcoin‚Äôs price outlook. Inflation Rates: High inflation can drive demand for Bitcoin as a hedge against currency devaluation, while low inflation may reduce its attractiveness. Economic Policies: Central bank policies, such as interest rate adjustments and quantitative easing, influence investor behavior and risk appetite, impacting Bitcoin‚Äôs price. Geopolitical Stability: Political stability and regulatory frameworks across different regions affect Bitcoin‚Äôs adoption and investment potential. Comparative Analysis: Bitcoin vs. Traditional Assets Bitcoin vs. Gold Both Bitcoin and gold are considered stores of value, but they exhibit distinct characteristics that influence their investment appeal. Supply Dynamics: Gold has a finite supply, but new gold is continually mined, while Bitcoin‚Äôs supply is strictly capped at 21 million coins. Volatility: Bitcoin is more volatile than gold, offering higher return potential but also higher risk. Utility: Gold has industrial applications and has been used as a currency for millennia, whereas Bitcoin‚Äôs primary utility lies in its decentralized digital nature and technological innovations. Bitcoin vs. Stocks and Bonds Bitcoin offers an alternative investment avenue compared to traditional financial instruments like stocks and bonds. Correlation with Markets: Bitcoin often exhibits low correlation with traditional markets, providing diversification benefits. Risk and Return: Bitcoin‚Äôs high volatility contrasts with the relatively stable returns of bonds and the growth potential of stocks. Investment Horizon: Bitcoin‚Äôs suitability varies based on investors‚Äô risk tolerance and investment horizon, with long-term holders potentially benefiting from significant price appreciation. Historical Context: Bitcoin‚Äôs Past Performance Examining Bitcoin‚Äôs historical price movements provides insights into its potential future trajectory. Previous Bull Runs Bitcoin has experienced several significant bull runs, each driven by different factors: 2013: Bitcoin‚Äôs first major price surge to over $1,000, driven by increasing media coverage and early adoption. 2017: The meteoric rise to nearly $20,000, fueled by speculative trading, ICOs, and mainstream media attention. 2020-2021: A surge to over $60,000, influenced by institutional investments, economic uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the rise of DeFi and NFTs. Market Corrections Following bull runs, Bitcoin has also undergone substantial corrections, highlighting its volatile nature. 2018 Correction: After reaching $20,000 in December 2017, Bitcoin‚Äôs price plummeted to around $3,200 by December 2018. May 2021 Correction: Following the peak of approximately $64,000, Bitcoin experienced a significant downturn due to regulatory concerns and market saturation. 2022-2023 Corrections: Continued market fluctuations in response to global economic conditions and shifting investor sentiment. Lessons from the Past Volatility Management: Investors must be prepared for significant price swings and implement risk management strategies. Long-Term Potential: Despite frequent corrections, Bitcoin has demonstrated substantial long-term growth, emphasizing its potential as a store of value and investment asset. Market Maturity: As the market matures, Bitcoin‚Äôs adoption, regulatory clarity, and technological advancements contribute to its resilience and growth prospects. Implications for the Cryptocurrency Ecosystem Impact on Altcoins Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements significantly influence the broader cryptocurrency market, including altcoins. Correlation and Spillover Effects: A bullish Bitcoin market often leads to increased investments in altcoins, driving their prices higher. Conversely, Bitcoin‚Äôs corrections can trigger sell-offs across the entire market. Investor Sentiment: Bitcoin‚Äôs performance shapes overall market sentiment, affecting investor confidence and risk appetite in the cryptocurrency space. Development of Financial Products The growing institutional interest in Bitcoin has spurred the development of various financial products and services. Bitcoin ETFs: As highlighted by BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT purchasing $2.6 billion in Bitcoin, ETFs offer regulated and accessible investment vehicles for both institutional and retail investors. Derivatives and Futures: Advanced financial instruments like options and futures contracts enable more sophisticated trading strategies, enhancing market liquidity and risk management. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Bitcoin‚Äôs integration into DeFi platforms facilitates lending, borrowing, and other financial services, expanding its utility and adoption. Regulatory Evolution The evolving regulatory landscape will continue to shape the cryptocurrency market‚Äôs future. Standardization: Efforts towards standardized regulations can enhance market stability and investor protection, fostering broader adoption. Compliance and Innovation: Balancing regulatory compliance with innovation is crucial for the sustainable growth of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Technological Advancements Ongoing technological developments are essential for Bitcoin‚Äôs continued relevance and competitiveness. Scalability Solutions: Implementing and optimizing scalability solutions like the Lightning Network can improve Bitcoin‚Äôs transaction efficiency and reduce fees. Security Enhancements: Advancements in cybersecurity measures protect Bitcoin holdings from potential threats, ensuring the network‚Äôs integrity and trustworthiness. Interoperability: Enhancing interoperability with other blockchain networks and financial systems can expand Bitcoin‚Äôs functionality and integration into various applications. Conclusion Sean Dawson‚Äôs analysis presents a measured outlook on Bitcoin‚Äôs potential to reach $150,000 by January 2025, assigning a 6% probability to this milestone. While Bitcoin continues to demonstrate substantial growth and institutional adoption, Dawson‚Äôs assessment highlights the challenges and uncertainties that temper the optimistic projections of some investors. Key takeaways from Dawson‚Äôs perspective include: Stable Market Sentiment: The consistent 25-delta skew indicates a balanced market sentiment, suggesting no significant shifts in traders‚Äô expectations. Market Consolidation: The current phase of market consolidation signals a period of balance between buying and selling pressures, potentially preceding either upward or downward price movements. Regulatory and Economic Factors: Ongoing regulatory developments and macroeconomic conditions play a critical role in shaping Bitcoin‚Äôs price trajectory, influencing investor behavior and market dynamics. For investors, Dawson‚Äôs cautious outlook underscores the importance of strategic investment approaches, including diversification, risk management, and staying informed about market indicators and regulatory changes. While Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term potential remains strong, navigating the inherent volatility and uncertainties requires a disciplined and informed investment strategy. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, the interplay between institutional adoption, technological advancements, and regulatory frameworks will shape Bitcoin‚Äôs future trajectory.

He noted that these transactions represent only one-third of the total sell-offs, which signals there‚Äôs broader market dynamics at play. Analyst: Retail investors have boosted Bitcoin demand The crypto analyst believes that despite sell-offs by seasoned investors, Bitcoin‚Äôs price resilience remains strong because of retail trader‚Äôs interest. Per CryptoQuant‚Äôs retail demand metrics, retail participation in Bitcoin has hit yearly highs. Source: X Per Maartuun, the surge in retail BTC trades extends to Bitcoin futures trading, with data from CoinGlass showing an Open Interest (OI) value of $61.18 billion. ‚ÄúRetail is also involved in futures trading,‚Äù the crypto analyst said. Maartuun also noted that the average purchase price for long-term holders stands at $24,481, reflecting unrealized gains of nearly 400% at Bitcoin‚Äôs current trading price of $99,203, as reported by CoinMarketCap. Technical indicators show positive trends Bitcoin is trading within a rising trend channel, signaling continued investor confidence. In the short term, the cryptocurrency is testing support at $98,000, with analysts projecting potential upward movements if this level holds. Over the long term, Bitcoin remains technically bullish. The price has climbed strongly since breaking past the $67,241 resistance level, meeting the $84,547 target and indicating further gains. Analysts see no major resistance ahead, although support around $80,000 could stabilize any pullbacks.

According to a report published on Dec. 6, the attackers started laying the groundwork for the Oct. 16 attack in mid-September, when a Telegram message from what appeared to be a trusted former contractor was sent to a Radiant Capital developer.  The message said the contractor was pursuing a new career opportunity related to smart contract auditing and was seeking feedback. It included a link to a zipped PDF file, which the developer opened and shared with other colleagues.  The message is now believed to have come from a ‚ÄúDPRK-aligned threat actor‚Äù who was impersonating the contractor, according to the report. The file contained a piece of malware called INLETDRIFT that established a persistent macOS backdoor while displaying a legitimate-looking PDF to the user.  Radiant Capital said that traditional checks and simulations showed no obvious discrepancies, making the threat virtually invisible during normal review stages.  Through access to the computers, the hackers were able to gain control of several private keys.  The North Korean link was identified by cybersecurity firm Mandiant, although the investigation is still incomplete. Mandiant said it believes the attack was orchestrated by UNC4736, a group aligned to the country‚Äôs Reconnaissance General Bureau. It is also known as AppleJeus or Citrine Sleet.  The group has been implicated in several other attacks linked to cryptocurrency companies. It has previously used fake crypto exchange websites to trick people into downloading malicious software through links to job openings and fake wallets.

XLM surged 630% while VET gained 330% in the past few weeks. Proposed Fed adoption and retailers‚Äô activity triggered a recent surge in utility tokens. Utility coins such as Stellar (XLM) and VeChain (VET) have seen remarkable growth during the latest cryptocurrency market rally, which has been largely driven by Bitcoin.

Babylon Labs have developed an innovative solution that uses the existing features of the Bitcoin network to allow for the staking of BTC without relying on bridges or smart contracts. This ensures that the Babylon staking solution maximally benefits from the inherent security of the Bitcoin blockchain, and in turn, the incentivization of staking helps bolster the security of other L2s and projects that are secured by Bitcoin. Users who choose to stake are rewarded for their contributions with Babylon Points, similar to wildly popular protocols such as EigenLayer that have been built on other chains such as Ethereum and Solana. As an official staking provider of the Babylon Bitcoin staking protocol, Bitrue has today launched a feature that provides their users with easy access to staking via Babylon, allowing them to potentially earn Babylon Points on the platform without requiring them to transfer any of their assets away from the exchange. Simultaneously, this BTC staked on Bitrue will generate additional rewards of BTC paid directly into the user‚Äôs account at 2.3% APR. With the price of BTC continuing to grow rapidly, this provides holders of BTC with multiple avenues to increase their wealth with minimal effort. ‚ÄúDeFi continues to be a huge growth area for the web3 industry, and while many thought that such a service would be impossible on Bitcoin, its imminent launch showcases the unlimited potential for innovation in this sector,‚Äù said Adam O‚ÄôNeill, Chief Marketing Officer at Bitrue. ‚ÄúBabylon Labs are unlocking enormous value for consumers and developers alike, and we are excited to work alongside them to provide a new dual rewards program to ensure that Bitrue customers receive the best returns on their investments.‚Äù Bitrue will also automatically manage users‚Äô Babylon Points, allowing them to see their points balance directly on the website.

The amazing price behavior of the token reminds us of its historic parabolic increase in 2017; analysts also point to another cryptocurrency, Rexas Finance (RXS), which may be on the verge of a similarly explosive surge. XRP‚Äôs historic parabolic move in 2017 XRP broke onto the cryptocurrency scene in 2017. Early 2017 trading under $0.01 saw a rapid climb over the coming year. Between March 2017 and January 2018, XRP rocketed an amazing 51,000% to $3.40. The parabolic rise was due to the growing adoption of cryptocurrency and Ripple as a blockchain for international settlement. Those who purchased XRP at its lowest points saw unmatched gains, therefore bringing the cryptocurrency into front view. But the path since then has been turbulent, dotted with legal challenges‚Äîespecially the SEC lawsuit against Ripple. XRP has shown endurance despite these challenges; its present price movement points to another record surge, perhaps just around the corner. Recent developments fueling XRP‚Äôs bullish momentum The retirement of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, an event many feel would help relieve regulatory pressure on Ripple, is one of several positive reasons for XRP‚Äôs recent climb. After the news, XRP‚Äôs price shot to $2.63, an 8.83% rise in 24 hours and a 5x gain over the past month. This momentum fits rising hope about Ripple‚Äôs continuous legal battles and the continuous worldwide expansion of its payment system. Should the positive attitude continue, experts estimate that XRP might reach $8.26 in the next six weeks, a 214% rise from its present level. Such a price surge would confirm XRP‚Äôs ranking as among the best-performing cryptocurrencies of the year. Rexas Finance (RXS): the new coin poised for a parabolic rise Although XRP‚Äôs path is interesting, another cryptocurrency is creating excitement since it reflects the potential of XRP‚Äôs 2017 surge. Thanks to its creative approach to real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, analysts have found Rexas Finance (RXS) to be the next crypto ready for a parabolic movement. By enabling anyone to tokenize actual assets‚Äîfrom real estate to intellectual property‚ÄîRexas Finance is changing the crypto scene. Because of this flawless integration of blockchain technology with practical uses, RXS is positioned as a major participant in the next wave of crypto acceptance. The presale of Rexas Finance has already generated approximately $21.64 million; it is currently in its ninth stage at $0.125 per token. This robust presale performance highlights investor belief in the project‚Äôs long-term viability and ambition. Presale stages are fast selling out, so once the official release is over, RXS is expected to rise significantly. The RXS team has chosen a community-centric strategy instead of venture capital funding, specifically avoiding it. This choice guarantees the public the ability to actively engage in the project‚Äôs expansion and builds confidence. With the token rising to $64 in the next few months, projections show RXS could follow XRP‚Äôs 2017 parabolic move. For early investors, this would represent an amazing return and help to cement RXS‚Äôs reputation as a top-performance coin. A good audit by Certik has raised investor trust by verifying the project‚Äôs security and openness. The recent listing of RXS on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko further raised its profile, drawing a fresh wave of investors and driving its price momentum. XRP keeps drawing institutional and retail investors ready to profit from its comeback as it gets closer to a possible climb above $8.26. Rexas Finance, meanwhile, promises a fresh horizon for crypto investors with the possibility for exponential gains evocative of XRP‚Äôs past surge. With its price of $0.125, RXS offers a reasonable starting point for those looking for chances for high growth. The cryptocurrency‚Äôs strong roadmap and presale momentum suggest that it may surpass even the most hopeful estimates. Rexas Finance is positioned to change the crypto scene by merging innovative technology with a user-first approach. The positive momentum of XRP indicates a possible surge to $8.26, sparking interest in one of the most durable cryptocurrencies. However, Rexas Finance (RXS) is unique among the new coins that are ready to copy XRP‚Äôs 2017 parabolic increase. Act today to guarantee your place in Rexas Finance (RXS) before prices explode.

The altcoins are also in the red today following the weekend gains, with XRP and DOGE being among the poorest performers on a daily scale.

Recall that the asset exploded to a new all-time high of $103,650 on Thursday after gaining about $8,000 in a day. The bears were quick to intercept the move and pushed the cryptocurrency south hard. BTC dumped by over ten grand in hours, causing a cascade of liquidations in the process. However, it bounced off and started to reclaim ground on Friday and during the weekend. The top came at $102,000 on Friday and $101,300 on Sunday evening. However, both attempts were faced by rejections that drove the asset south. As of now, bitcoin stands shy of $99,000 after a minor daily decline.

Dmitry V., whose identity is partially concealed under Polish law, is accused of fraud and money laundering during his tenure at WEX. WEX, once a prominent crypto platform and successor to BTC-e, collapsed in 2018 under allegations of illicit activity. The exchange, notorious for its lax identity verification practices, is alleged to have processed funds from high-profile hacks, including the infamous Mt. Gox breach . Reports estimate $450 million in customer funds went missing during its downfall. ‚ÄúThe individual is in custody awaiting completion of the extradition process,‚Äù a Polish police spokesperson confirmed. If extradited to the U.S., Dmitry V. could face charges carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. A History of Controversies This is not Dmitry V.‚Äôs first brush with international law enforcement. In August 2021, Polish authorities detained him, only to release him after 40 days due to a court ruling. In the summer of 2022, Interpol apprehended him at Zagreb Airport in Croatia following a separate extradition request from Kazakhstan. Earlier, in 2019, Italian authorities also arrested him, but he was released after procedural errors were found in the extradition documents. WEX‚Äôs predecessor, BTC-e, has a similarly tainted legacy. Alexander Vinnik, known as ‚ÄúMr. Bitcoin‚Äù and the former head of BTC-e, was extradited to the U.S. in 2022 after serving two years in a French prison. In May this year, Vinnik pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering involving transactions worth over $9 billion from 2011 to 2017. WEX‚Äôs Shadowy Legacy Lingers At its peak, WEX handled over $9 billion in transactions, boasting a user base of more than one million, including many in the United States. However, its reputation as a ‚Äúdark‚Äù exchange, coupled with links to massive crypto hacks, has kept its legacy under scrutiny. Dmitry V.‚Äôs arrest is another chapter in the ongoing saga of crypto‚Äôs early-era scandals.

LINK Price Attempts a Breakout Eyeing to Smash a New ATH appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Chainlink continues to expand its use cases with multiple collaborations. In a recent update, the platform has joined Banco, Microsoft, &COMm in phase 2 of Brazil‚Äôs BRX CBDC pilot. Besides, the platform‚Äôs adoption rate has been soaring, suggesting a positive impact over its native token, LINK, which has broken above the range. The LINK price is demonstrating acute strength after rising above the horizontal consolidation and appears to be primed to rise over the current ATH shortly. The long-term price action of Chainlink suggests the price has been pretty volatile since the start. Therefore, the range-bound consolidation that persisted for more than 2 years has raised many concerns. However, the token broke the trend then and now, indicating there is more room for the token to swell. Currently, the LINK price is testing the levels not seen since January 2022. Now that the bulls who were stuck at the highs are slowly coming into profit, is there any possibility of LINK price marking a 3-digit figure in the upcoming bull run? The long-term chart of Chainlink prices is about to experience the very first weekly Golden Cross since its inception. However, it has been delayed for a couple of months and the recent upswing is expected to be an outcome of the bullish event. Meanwhile, the bears seem to have held a strong grip over the resistance zone between $27.55 and $28.41, which is restricting the rally from surpassing the zone. Secondly, the +Di of DMI levels has triggered a bearish divergence while the -Di continues to head towards the lower range. This suggests the LINK bulls could be exhausted for a while, which has been seen since the start of the week as selling pressure escalates. However, the bulls are trying hard to fight the bearish heat as it holds the ascending support. Meanwhile, the token has plunged below this support in the short term, which suggests the price may drop below $25. If the Bulls manage to trigger a healthy rebound before the day‚Äôs close, the upswing could be revived, causing the price to revamp a strong rise beyond $30.",POSITIVE,LINK,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | LINK | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/chainlink-golden-cross-alert-link-price-attempts-a-breakout-eyeing-to-smash-a-new-ath/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37417681,https://coinpedia.org/?p=390922,1733736252,Is Bitcoin Going to Crash? Key Risks and Market Trends You Need to Watch,"The post Is Bitcoin Going to Crash? Key Risks and Market Trends You Need to Watch appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin‚Äôs market is showing several warning signs as investor sentiment soars to extreme greed levels. The Fear & Greed Index has surged to 84, a number that has historically been a red flag for potential price corrections. Adding to the tension are key on-chain data metrics like the Sell-Side Risk Ratio and Net Taker Volume, which suggest that Bitcoin could be nearing its market peak. Bitcoin has already dropped 0.4% to $99,439 in just a few hours due to the growing negative sentiment. Could the market be on the brink of a significant downturn, or will key economic reports this week change the game entirely? As uncertainty looms, a closer look at market trends and expert analysis could give us answers. Experts Sound the Alarm: Bitcoin Nears Its ‚ÄúDeath Zone‚Äù 10X Research analysts are warning investors to stay cautious. Their latest report highlights that Bitcoin is entering what they call its ‚Äúdeath zone.‚Äù The term refers to altitudes above 8,000 meters in mountaineering, where survival becomes much harder due to reduced oxygen levels. Similarly, Bitcoin‚Äôs market indicators suggest it is entering a critical phase where price momentum could weaken significantly. For the past two weeks, Bitcoin has been trading within a tight range and forming a Doji candlestick pattern. This pattern is a classic sign of market uncertainty and indecision. While it can signal a period of consolidation, 10X Research suggests other signals indicate Bitcoin could be on the verge of a correction instead. Trading volumes are falling, and buying interest at these higher price levels is weakening‚Äîboth of which are key signs that Bitcoin may struggle to maintain its current price near $100,000 . The Market Is At Risk Bitcoin‚Äôs on-chain data reveals more concerning signs. Trading momentum is slowing, investor interest is declining, and market sentiment is beginning to shift. These factors are raising the risk of a price correction. While analysts don‚Äôt believe Bitcoin has already reached its peak, they emphasize that careful monitoring is vital in this phase. The market could either stabilize or face a downturn in the coming days. Bitcoin Is Bleeding Supporting bearish sentiment, Bitcoin‚Äôs intraday pullback of 1.74% led to $62.89 billion being wiped from the entire cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin‚Äôs total market cap is now $3.55 trillion. Technical analysis suggests that a bearish reversal from a local resistance level could lead to a 12% price drop, with $87,680 as the next potential support level. Liquidations have surged to $290 million as a result of this market downturn, with $217 million worth of long positions being wiped out. This indicates that selling pressure is growing, as investors react to the market‚Äôs current uncertainty. Rising Wedge Pattern Adds to Bearish Signals While some traders are still holding on to a bullish stance, technical analysis warns of further downside risks. A rising wedge pattern has formed, which is typically a bearish indicator. This suggests Bitcoin could see further price declines if the pattern continues to play out. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Michael Saylor Urges US to Establish Bitcoin Reserve Amid Trump‚Äôs Pro-Crypto Stance , What‚Äôs Next for Bitcoin?

With the current market value of gold at $18 trillion, Saylor's estimate would put the price of Bitcoin at around $8.6 million per coin. ‚ÄúBitcoin will easily go up 10 times gold,‚Äù Saylor said in a recent interview, touting Bitcoin‚Äôs superiority as a store of value and treasury asset over traditional options like gold, real estate and bonds. Saylor cited the limitations of traditional commodities and assets for institutional and corporate treasuries, noting that Bitcoin offers a superior alternative due to its higher annualized rate of return (ARR) and better liquidity. ‚ÄúGold offers an ARR of 7%, real estate 10%, and bonds around 4-5%. None of these beat the S&P benchmark cost of capital,‚Äù Saylor explained. Bitcoin, by contrast, offers an ARR of 60%, making it a more attractive asset for both companies and wealthy investors. Related News: Will Donald Trump Fire Fed Chairman Jerome Powell? He Gave His Answer Saylor argued that calling Bitcoin ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù underestimates its potential. ‚ÄúBitcoin is digital capital,‚Äù he said, suggesting that Bitcoin could replace not just gold but also real estate, the S&P index and other institutional capital assets. Looking forward, Saylor predicts that Bitcoin could become a ‚Äúhundred trillion dollar asset class‚Äù by 2045, and projects a floor price of $13 million per coin. He predicts that Bitcoin's current volatility and rates of return will gradually decrease over the next two decades, eventually stabilizing as the asset matures. *This is not investment advice.

The company‚Äôs expansions in Ohio and proprietary energy innovations, like two-phase immersion cooling, significantly reduce costs and improve efficiency. MARA's hybrid strategy of retaining mined Bitcoin and leveraging debt for more Bitcoin positions it well for potential price appreciation. Despite strong growth and innovative strategies, MARA faces risks from Bitcoin price volatility and reliance on external energy markets. MARA Holdings ( MARA ) is currently at the frontier of the crypto boom. The company is capitalizing on advanced technologies and strategic acquisitions to cement its position as a leader in bitcoin mining and energy-efficient computing. Mara is successfully navigating the volatile and increasingly competitive crypto industry through large expansions in mining capacity and cost-saving measures. Mining Operations MARA's recent expansion really shows its commitment to growing its scale and efficiencies. The company has increased its interconnect-approved capacity by 372 MW for three data centers in Ohio alone in Q3 of 2024. This puts MARA in a great position to expand its mining operations for the foreseeable future. The company also acquired its Hopedale and Hannibal facilities at just $270,000 per MW. This figure is far below the industry average of around $900,000-$1.5 million per MW. MARA is also developing a greenfield facility in Ohio, which should add another 150 MW of capacity. These expansions are part of MARA's strategy of growing its operations. They also allow Mara to reduce its dependence on third-party providers. MARA will be able to significantly minimize operation risks and improve cost by owning and operating 65% of its 1.5 HW of compute capacity. This vertical integration aligns with its goal to lead the digital asset sector while at the same time maintaining flexibility in energy sourcing. Energy Innovations Energy efficiency is very important in the energy-intensive Bitcoin mining industry. In fact, the overall energy consumption of Bitcoin mining is now comparable to the energy consumption of some smaller countries like Poland. MARA is successfully taking steps to address this challenge through technological advancements and a growing list of partnerships. The company has developed its own propriety Two-Phase Immersion Cooling technology, which greatly improves energy efficiency by increasing power density compared to traditional methods by up to four times. MARA has also successfully reduced cooling costs by up to 60%. MARA has also established a partnership with NGON, which converts flared natural gas into electricity. This partnership has allowed the company to reduce electricity costs to nearly $0.01 per kWh. This figure is around four times less than the market average price, showing MARA's ability to acquire energy generation at incredibly cheap costs. Because of these improvements, MARA is one of the most cost-competitive bitcoin miners in the industry by increasing efficiencies. MARA Bitcoin's Rise and MARA's Strong Strategic Positioning Bitcoin's change from a niche asset to a globally recognized digital store of value has provided companies like MARA the opportunity to thrive. MARA has seized upon Bitcoin's growing popularity by expanding operations and growing its holdings. Bitcoin has unique attributes as the first major digital asset. For instance, it has an artificially capped supply and a decentralized nature. This has made it an increasingly valuable asset for investors seeking to diversify. While companies like MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) have taken a more direct investment approach by accumulating Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset, MARA is also focused on Bitcoin mining. MARA not only accumulates Bitcoin but also generates revenue from its production of Bitcoin by taking advantage of its increasingly large and energy-efficient mining operation. On top of this, MARA is also in a great position to copy MicroStrategy's innovative playbook of accumulating debt to buy even more bitcoin. MARA incorporates a hybrid strategy in which it retains much of the bitcoin it mines. This allows MARA to benefit from potential price appreciation while it focuses on its mining operations to ensure steady revenue generation. This also allows MARA to employ MicroStrategy's ""infinite money glitch"" strategy of borrowing money at cheap rates in order to buy more bitcoin, hoping for bitcoin to appreciate, and making money off the difference. MARA Financials MARA reported good results in Q3. The company's revenues increased to $131.6 million during the quarter, which represents a jump from $97.8 million YOY. MARA was able to maintain its production levels and mined 2,070 Bitcoins during the quarter, despite Bitcoin's volatility during the quarter. The company also holds a great deal of Bitcoin in reserve, with 26,747 Bitcoin valued at nearly $3 billion at current prices. This figure will undoubtedly increase as MARA appears to be following MicroStrategy's lead in buying Bitcoin. The company is utilizing a long-term holding strategy as a leveraged play on Bitcoin's long-term appreciation. However, investors should be wary that MARA's strategy of shareholder dilution to fund its purchases is also a double-edged sword. MARA Risks Despite its strengths, MARA is still a risky investment. The company is involved in an incredibly volatile industry where Bitcoin price fluctuations can significantly impact profitability in the positive or negative. Donald Trump's presidential election victory has only increased volatility, given how much speculation has ramped up as a result. This risk is only increased by MARA's strategy of holding a large number of Bitcoin. This Bitcoin holding is often used as leverage to buy even more Bitcoin. Another major risk facing MARA is its dependence on stranded gas and external energy markets for cheap energy. If energy supply constraints or price increases occur, this can also have a negative impact on profitability, not to mention the additional risk of Bitcoin's price itself falling. These cheap energy sources are also relatively hard to find. Furthermore, while MARA's plans to move into AI are promising, it also leaves a lot of room for execution risks due to its untested nature. Conclusion MARA is taking a relatively new approach that has allowed it to do well in the digital asset space. While MARA is certainly not risk-averse, it represents a solid investment at its current valuation of ~$8 billion. While the company does have a relatively high forward PE of 40, MARA could see its market capitalization explode if Bitcoin continues to appreciate at its current rate.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4742957-mara-holdings-a-pioneering-force-in-crypto?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37417604.jpeg

That's precisely the situation facing bitcoin (BTC) and XRP (XRP) traders.   Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, is trading at record highs near $100,000, meaning it's now in uncharted waters. XRP trades at $2.44, with the 2018 record high around $3.30 as the only chart resistance before we enter the price discovery mode like BTC.  One way to identify key resistances is to study the distribution of open interest, the dollar value of active option contracts, at various strike price levels.  On Deribit, the world's leading crypto options exchange, BTC's $120,000 strike call option is the most popular contract at the moment, with a notional open interest of $1.93 billion, according to data source Deribit Metrics.  A strike with the highest open interest often marks a resistance level because call sellers, typically institutions, face significant losses if prices rise above that point. As a result, they often act to keep prices from exceeding that level. Conversely, the strike level can also act as a magnet due to the hedging activity of market makers or entities tasked with creating order book liquidity.  Recall that before and immediately after the U.S. election, the $100,000 call was the most preferred in terms of notional open interest. The price has now consolidated around the six-figure mark.  At press time, the call option at the $100,000 strike is still the second-most popular contract, with open interest of $1.8 billion. It is followed by the $110,000 strike call, which boasts open interest of $1.68 billion.  We can also see that $500 million is locked in the $200,000 strike call, representing a bet that the bitcoin price will double. Most open interest is concentrated in the June 2025 and September 2025 expiries. Analysts at Standard Chartered say they expect the price to reach that level by the end of 2025.  Key levels for XRP  In XRP's case, the $1 call option is the most popular strike, with over $3 million in open interest. The option is deeply in-the-money, or in profit, as the cryptocurrency currently trades near $2.42.  The focus now is on the $2.8 call option, where traders have locked in $2 million in open interest. The next potential target is at $5. The so-called deep out-of-the-money call is the third-most active open, with open interest of $1.12 million.",NEUTRAL,BTC | XRP,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/09/gauging-bitcoin-xrp-resistance-levels-after-record-price-rallies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bab925c1166b9c4a528a72df9ea2391a5f2564e9-3176x1199.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) report, persistent near-zero retail inflation showed that China‚Äôs economy struggled with low domestic demand as wholesale prices remained deflationary. Domestic demand remained sluggish despite Beijing‚Äôs series of stimulus efforts since September, which included interest rate cuts, support for stock and property markets, and efforts to incentivize bank lending. ‚ÄúWe believe deflation will continue in China, especially based on the previous experience during trade wars.‚Äù ~ Becky Liu , Head of China macro strategy at Standard Chartered Bank Liu said that PPI inflation typically fell to negative territory during trade wars, referencing the ongoing U.S.-China trade war. She pointed out that the situation was no different, adding that China‚Äôs producer price index inflation was likely to remain negative the following year. Goldman Sachs predicts that China‚Äôs near-zero CPI figures will continue into 2025 The investment bank‚Äôs analysts similarly projected that China‚Äôs near-zero consumer price index figures would persist next year. The analysts, however, noted that some parts of the economy showed signs of recovery. China reported strong retail sales growth in October, beating expectations from Reuters analysts. In November, the second-largest economy in the world also showed expansion in manufacturing activities for two months in a row, according to Goldman Sachs . According to CNBC, top Chinese leaders are expected to meet at the Central Economic Work Conference starting December 11th to discuss 2025‚Äôs stimulus measures and economic goals. On December 9th, Fitch Ratings reduced their forecast of China‚Äôs 2025 GDP growth from 4.5% to 4.3%. The credit rating agency adjusted its September projections for 2026 growth downwards from 4.3% to 4%. Brian Coulton, Fitch Ratings Chief Economist, assumed that the U.S. trade policies towards China would take a sharp ‚Äòprojectionist turn‚Äô for 2025 and 2026. He noted that an extended decline in the property market posed a critical risk to the agency‚Äôs forecast, although there were ‚Äòtentative signs of stabilization‚Äô. Notably, China will report its November trade data and retail sales on December 10th and December 16th, respectively.

He made this statement when asked about Trump‚Äôs previous hostility to the crypto market. Recall that in 2021, the now-crypto-friendly politician labeled Bitcoin a scam. Was Trump Always Pro-Crypto? CBS journalist Margaret Brennan anchored the interview with Garlinghouse. She asked the Ripple CEO: ‚ÄúBefore this cycle, in June of 2021, Donald Trump was saying, ‚ÄòBitcoin seems like a scam.‚Äô Do you understand what happened with that transformation?‚Äù Her question highlighted Trump‚Äôs previously hostile outlook on crypto assets like Bitcoin. In June 2021, Trump stressed his dislike for BTC because it competed against the U.S. dollar. He added that he wanted the country‚Äôs sovereign currency to become the world‚Äôs currency. Notably, some individuals voiced their disagreement with Trump‚Äôs pessimistic view at the time. Without shedding light on Trump‚Äôs past with Bitcoin, Garlinghouse focused on the present. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have a front-row seat to that. I think it‚Äôs clear that Donald Trump embraced and crypto embraced Donald Trump,‚Äù he replied. How Crypto Has Faired With Trump‚Äôs Support During his campaign for U.S. presidency, Trump repeatedly echoed his support for the crypto industry. He also promised to fulfill various things to boost crypto adoption in the country if he won the November election. Since winning the election, he has begun fulfilling his promises. For example, he recently appointed several pro-crypto individuals to political seats. Among them is Paul Atkins, a crypto-friendly politician that Trump appointed to replace Gary Gensler as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chairman. Interestingly, news of Trump‚Äôs selection was key in driving BTC above the $100,000 price mark to an all-time high above $103,600. At the time of writing, the apex crypto asset sold for $99,500.

The Pi Core Team‚Äôs December roadmap announcement for the mainnet open launch is highly anticipated, though past delays have sparked community skepticism. The Recent Developments It has been more than five years since Pi Network‚Äôs launch. The project allows people to mine digital assets directly from their smartphones without significant energy consumption. However, it has raised some eyebrows across the community since Pi Network‚Äôs native token and open mainnet have yet to see the light of day. Despite the controversy, it remains one of the most talked-about projects in the cryptocurrency space, with a growing community base. Not long ago, the team revealed the Pi Network application had surpassed the milestone of 100 million downloads. Earlier this year, Pi Network‚Äôs developers claimed that the launch of Open Network depends on completing 15 million KYC user verifications. According to Pi News, 14 million people have already complied with the rules, with one million left to do so. The final deadline is December 31. This date was moved several times, causing mixed reactions from the community. The latest extension was announced at the end of November: ‚ÄúThe first Grace Period deadline to submit the KYC application is now extended to December 31, 2024, making it the same as the second deadline to migrate .‚Äù So, What‚Äôs Going On? It is safe to assume that the community of Pi Network is eagerly waiting for a groundbreaking development that could come at any time now. After all, the Pi Core Team previously promised to announce the mainnet open roadmap, which should provide more clarity on when users will be able to buy and sell Pi tokens in December. Some praised the team for providing the information, while others were less supportive, suggesting there would be another extension. We have yet to see whether the remaining weeks of 2024 will offer any major developments or if the pessimists will turn right.

Table of Contents Solana spirals down as SOL ETF news triggers speculation DTX Exchange raises $9.6m with in-demand top-tier DeFi features Why SOL holders shift to DTX Exchange this December Final thoughts The DeFi market is ready to witness a historic revolution as Bitcoin has hit new success levels after the $100k milestone and institutional adoption. After Trump picks the next crypto-friendly SEC Chair, the decentralized economy will take a major turn with new crypto-related products and scaling adoption for cryptocurrencies, especially utility tokens. However, the recent Solana (SOL) news has shocked holders, leading a major shift to other utility tokens poised to lead the upcoming Defi revolution with smart trends and cutting-edge technologies. DTX Exchange aims to emerge as a central figure in the upcoming years as it introduces the best trading features out of all existing platforms. Solana spirals down as SOL ETF news triggers speculation Fox Business Journalist, Eleanor Terrett has shocked Solana holders with the ETF news. He revealed that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has informed two of the ETF applicants that their filings might be rejected due to regulatory concerns. This has lowered community steam as the SEC has a deadline of January 25 to pass initial rulings on SOL ETF. This news has triggered a 2.7% price drop for Solana as major speculations about ETF hype have led traders to shift their investments to other utility tokens that can significantly contribute to Defi advancements under Trump‚Äôs rule and show massive growth. While 400% price targets are now a point of speculation for many traders, DTX Exchange is emerging as their new investment avenue for legendary gains.

DTX Exchange offers features like 1000x leverage and advanced automation so traders can enjoy bullish gains with higher market positions. This high utility project takes a major step ahead by the platform‚Äôs 120k+ asset holding capacity under one roof including stocks, cryptos, forex, equities, and commodities. Furthermore, the native, hybrid L1 blockchain ‚ÄòVulcanX‚Äô makes it easy for traders to enjoy low-cost trading at a 10,000 TPS record-setting speed and accuracy, providing a seamless trading environment. One major utility that gives DTX Exchange a major competitive edge is its decentralized security schemas with KYC-free onboarding and non-custodial ‚ÄòPhoenix Wallet‚Äô, now available in Apple and Android stores. This has made DTX Exchange a promising TradFi project ready to disrupt market rankings. Why SOL holders shift to DTX Exchange this December Solana has undoubtedly been one of the most successful DeFi projects with high blockchain utility and a vibrant ecosystem. However, the recent ETF news has somehow spread pessimism for SOL holders, leading them to explore other similar L1 alternatives that can revolutionize the sector with their power and high growth potential to crack into top rankings. This has made them enter the DTX presale, which has raised more than $9.6 million in stage 6 of the public presale, continuing to count more. Traders can buy DTX tokens for $0.12 in the ongoing stage, and this early entry can help them earn big money as the DTX project is about to announce its live trading and CEX listing in the next few weeks. Final thoughts DTX Exchange is ready to change the Defi sector with its hybrid L1 blockchain and advanced trading features. This marks the beginning of a new trading era, presenting a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for early adopters to participate in a smart platform poised to display massive growth after its official launch in 2025.

The stablecoin‚Äôs main purpose is to ‚Äúscale crvUSD‚Äù and compete with Sky‚Äôs sDAI and Ethena‚Äôs sUSDe. You might also like: PEPE continues its rally despite whale selloff Moreover, scrvUSD allows users to generate revenue through Curve Finance‚Äôs lending and staking strategies ‚Äî currently offering a 13% annual percentage rate ‚Äî per the CEX.IO analysis. The stablecoin has already reached a $20 million market cap. Although scrvUSD also aims to stabilize crvUSD interest rates, they remained volatile due to high leverage demand. For example, borrowing rates surged to 50% on key markets following the U.S. elections. ‚ÄúHigher interest rates offer larger revenue for Curve per operation, but they limit new borrows. To address this, Curve DAO increased scrvUSD holders‚Äô revenue share from 10% to 20%, and adjusted the crvUSD yield mechanism, successfully lowering borrowing rates to 20%, and boosting scrvUSD deposits.‚Äù Otychenko said. The launch of scrvUSD brought increased demand for the CRV token as well. Otychenko points out that the rising CRV Relative Strength Index puts the token in the overbought zone as it rose above the 75 mark on Dec. 4. ‚ÄúOn the weekly chart, the RSI is in the overbought zone, suggesting a pause is likely before further upward movement,‚Äù Otychenko added. The analyst expects a long-term surge for the CRV price due to its growing ecosystem. However, the asset would likely face a ‚Äúnotable‚Äù correction before recording another rally.

37416795,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51706,1733734200,"Should You Buy Tron (TRX), Rexas Finance (RXS) and Forget About Ripple (XRP)?","Investors are always searching for the next great prospect as the crypto market develops. 0Ripple (XRP) has long been a mainstay of the blockchain scene, new initiatives like Rexas Finance (RXS) and existing networks like Tron (TRX) are fast picking popularity. These initiatives are reshining blockchain and distributed finance (DeFi), not only surfing the tide of invention. If you‚Äôre looking for development prospects, you might want to concentrate on Rexas Finance and Tron since they offer great potential relative to the more established and saturated ripple. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Transformation in Real-World Tokenization of Assets Leading the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization movement, Rexas Finance is changing how people and businesses engage with both physical and virtual assets. Its platform lets users tokenize real-world assets‚Äîlike real estate, goods, and collectibles‚Äîsuch that they may be sold anywhere in the globe. This invention democratizes asset ownership and opens fresh value sources by bridging the gap between conventional banking and blockchain. Currently, at Stage 9 of their presale, Rexas Finance has the RXS token valued at $0.125. With 92.18% of tokens sold, an outstanding mark reflecting great investor confidence, this presale stage is almost finished. Early adopters have an amazing chance to get large returns since the next stage pricing is anticipated to grow to $0.15 with a projected listing price of $0.20. Rexas has so far raised around $23.1 million, evidence of its increasing appeal and promise. Rexas Finance has started an interesting $1 million giveaway to involve its community even more. Each twenty lucky winner will get RXS tokens valued at $50,000. Participants must finish chores like turning friends in reference to raise their chances and entering their ERC20 wallet addresses This program not only promotes community development but also allows early supporters to benefit as the project picks up steam. Further adding to its legitimacy are listings of Rexas Finance on CoinMarketCap (CMC) and CoinGecko, two of the most reliable sites for monitoring project data and cryptocurrency values. These listings help RXS be more visible, which facilitates monitoring of its performance and draws institutional as well as retail interest. Rexas Finance has shown its dedication to building a safe and reliable ecosystem in an area where security is of first importance. Leading blockchain security company CertiK conducted a thorough examination of the platform. This audit guarantees the integrity of its smart contracts and increases project investor trust. By giving security a top priority, Rexas is establishing itself as a dependable option for people wishing to make tokenized real-world asset investments. Tron (TRX): A Decentralized Giant. Tron (TRX), a decentralized giant, has long been acknowledged as a leader in decentralizing and blockchain scalability. Originally intended as a venue for smart contracts, distributed apps (dApps), and content sharing, Tron has found a niche in the blockchain system. Tron‚Äôs effective proof-of-stake consensus mechanism‚Äîwhich permits low transaction costs and fast processing‚Äîis among its best characteristics. This has become the first choice for companies looking for scalable solutions and developers. Tron‚Äôs growing alliances and integrations also guarantee its practical use significance, confirming its position in the cryptocurrency scene. Tron has chosen a more all-encompassing strategy that stresses distributed finance, content production, and worldwide accessibility, while Ripple (XRP) has concentrated on cross-border payments and financial institution collaborations. Its adaptability makes it a viable candidate for steady expansion. Why Forget About Ripple (XRP)? Ripple is a blockchain pioneer because it emphasizes banking and cross-border payments. However, the extended regulatory difficulties it confronts‚Äîespecially in the United States‚Äîhave investors worried. Although XRP is becoming increasingly popular after some legal successes, the larger range of initiatives like Rexas Finance and Tron has more fascinating development prospects. Both RXS and TRX have clear benefits: With its RWA tokenizing, Rexas Finance is opening whole new markets and generating investment possibilities never before reachable for regular investors. Tron guarantees continuous relevance in the changing blockchain scene by offering a distributed architecture supporting a wide spectrum of applications. Ripple‚Äôs emphasis is yet very limited, which could restrict its expansion possibilities in comparison to these more flexible and energetic initiatives. Conclusion: The verdict is Rexas Finance and Tron Lead the Way. Rexas Finance (RXS) and Tron (TRX) present strong arguments for investors trying to optimize their returns in the next years. With its tokenizing platform, supported by an active presale, significant giveaways, and increased visibility via CMC and CoinGecko listings, Rexas Finance is reinventing asset management. Its CertiK audit lends still another degree of confidence, which increases its appeal as an investment. Tron‚Äôs established presence and ongoing creativity also make it a great option for those looking for a distributed ecosystem with practical uses. With RXS still in its presale, the moment to act is now; by concentrating on Rexas Finance and Tron, investors can access projects influencing the direction of blockchain technology.

37416958,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624709,1733734115,Bulgarian crypto scam is a top 5 whale in JustLend after exiting with client funds,"BETL, hiding behind a simple business model, turned into one final crypto grab. The firm focused on the Bulgarian market, where those greedy for passive income ended up locked out of their savings. Bulgarian investors seemingly did not learn their lessons after the crash of OneCoin . A new passive income scheme, Blue Electric Technology (BETL), promised regular payouts and a seemingly solid investment. The promising startup, however, performed an exit scam on the weekend, leaving some of its investors in disbelief after locking in their savings. On December 6, BETL stopped paying out the promised returns, citing technical difficulties. At one point, BETL representatives asked for deposits of 99 USDT to verify accounts, with the promise of returning the funds. None of this happened, leaving thousands of Bulgarian investors scrambling to inform authorities and find the persons responsible for the scam. Even after media reports that BETL was probably a dishonest Ponzi, users continued to send 99 USDT to the project‚Äôs TRON address . Based on community estimates, at least 3,500 and up to 6,000 investors tried to verify their profiles, not believeing BETL was doing its last rug pull. In total, the estimated number of investors ranges between 8,000 and 30,000. A breakdown of the BETL haul shows that investors poured in up to $80M, while early entrants withdrew $50M. Out of the remaining funds, BETL financed its generous PR campaign and its office network. In the end, the firm retained $20M, including the last desperate transactions asking for 99 USDT to verify accounts. Some of the last depositors even sent additional funds to try and reclaim their previous investment. BETL itself has not disappeared, and may be back as a similar scheme, known as PowerPal. The project casually rebranded its own old Facebook page, stating that BETL had ‚Äòfinished‚Äô its mission, instead of exit-scamming. Without a pause, PowerPal took over where BETL left, once again offering investment packages in return for a regular payout. PowerPal is distributed through subscription links, listing several tiers of investment, again based on physical battery packs. BETL and PowerPal among top JustLend holders Even after the rug pull, BETL and its next iteration, PowerPal have retained some funds in identifiable wallets. Based on wallets revealed by some of the scammed investors, BETL holds a small slush fund of $226K from asking for verification fees. BETL asked for deposits of 99 USDT to verify accounts, but never returned the funds as promised. | Source: TronScan But the biggest holdings have been stored in another wallet, the original address advertised by BETL to Bulgarian investors. The wallet in question holds another highly liquid 415,599 TRON-based USDT. Some of the client deposits have been transformed into JustLend USDT, a potentially yield-bearing asset. The wallet identified as belonging to BETL holds a total of 581,321,256 jUSDT. As a result, the wallet identified as BETL is now the fifth-biggest whale holder of jUSDT, holding 4.65% of the token‚Äôs supply. However, jUSDT is not pegged to a $1 value, so BETL now holds around $6.074M in JustLend assets. The exact value of the portfolio varies based on market conditions. BETL promised a power bank rental business BETL is part of a family of business offers that try their best not to look like crypto scams. The startup claims to sell power bank devices, which then rent out batteries for the Chinese market, where users would charge their phones on the go. The company put up a reliable public face for months, building a chain of up to 30 offices and organizing public events. BETL was even preparing for a big Christmas gala on December 21. BETL opened offices in many Bulgarian cities, using the locations for extra publicity and recruitment. | Source: BETL archives Similar schemes include promises of shared farming, bee-keeping, or other physical projects. The business model is the rationale to make the end buyer pay for an investment package. All investors are urged to pay in crypto, in this case USDT on the TRON or BSC network. However, most buyers are not using self-custodial wallets, instead buying and investing through a fintech app. The buyers of BETL are not crypto natives, and the project itself stays away from crypto communities on X. Instead, BETL recruited its investors through Facebook and ran its operations through Telegram, a practically untraceable communications channel. Days after the end of payments, it turned out some of the so-called ‚Äòmanagers‚Äô were using stolen photos and fake identities, later deleting their Telegram profiles. The Bulgarian manager of the company, Ms. Kalina Nikolova, deleted her social media, citing threats claiming she misled investors. Nikolova participated in some of the BETL high-profile events, which suspiciously resembled older OneCoin rallies. BETL even used sports and media celebrities to boost its profile, though some of those celebrities claimed their image was used without their knowledge. Were Bulgarian investors totally unaware? It is possible that some investors took their risk with BETL, while being aware the payouts would eventually end. ‚Äú We all knew it was a pyramid scheme, and we joined willingly ,‚Äù wrote Facebook user Ivan Asenov. Similar crypto-based pyramids have been making the rounds on Facebook communities, often played for fun money, with the full awareness of the coming rug pull. However, BETL also drew in unaware investors, some of which took out personal loans to buy the BETL investment packages.

37416747,https://coinpaprika.com/news/amazon-shareholders-push-for-bitcoin-to-fight-inflation,1733734025,Amazon Shareholders Push for Bitcoin to Fight Inflation,"Amazon shareholders are pushing for the company to allocate part of its $88 billion cash reserves to Bitcoin, suggesting it could act as a hedge against inflation. The proposal, spearheaded by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), argues that Bitcoin has historically outperformed traditional assets like bonds despite its volatility. The NCPPR criticized reliance on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) , claiming it underestimates the real inflation rate, which they believe is closer to 10%. In their proposal, they stated, ‚ÄúAmazon should consider adding assets to its treasury that appreciate more than bonds, even if they are volatile in the short term.‚Äù Proponents view this move as a way to protect Amazon‚Äôs purchasing power while positioning the company as a leader in adopting modern financial strategies. Bitcoin‚Äôs growing adoption among corporations adds weight to the proposal. Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have already embraced Bitcoin for their reserves, with MicroStrategy holding over 402,000 BTC , valued at over $40 billion. Advocates believe Amazon‚Äôs potential adoption could set a trend for other giants like Apple, signaling a broader shift toward Bitcoin in corporate boardrooms. However, critics argue that Amazon‚Äôs financial structure makes Bitcoin adoption unlikely. One researcher pointed out that while Amazon holds $88 billion in cash, it also has $67 billion in debt and $87 billion in lease obligations , requiring significant liquidity for operations. These constraints, they claim, make adopting a volatile asset like Bitcoin impractical. The proposal is expected to be discussed at Amazon‚Äôs 2025 annual shareholder meeting. Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has also called on Amazon to accept Bitcoin as payment, further fueling the debate. Microsoft is also facing similar pressure. Shareholders at Microsoft will vote on a Bitcoin treasury proposal during their annual meeting on December 10. However, the company‚Äôs management has advised rejecting the idea, stating it is ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù since treasury strategies are already under regular review. Still, the involvement of BlackRock , a major investor and key player in Bitcoin ETFs, has led to speculation that the proposal could gain traction. The growing momentum for Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset reflects broader concerns about inflation and the declining value of fiat currency. Tesla‚Äôs high-profile Bitcoin purchase in 2021 and MicroStrategy‚Äôs continued investments have set an example for others. Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy‚Äôs executive chairman, has even suggested that adopting Bitcoin could add trillions of dollars to Microsoft‚Äôs market capitalization. Other companies are also exploring Bitcoin strategies. Video platform Rumble recently announced it had established a Bitcoin treasury shortly after discussions with Saylor. Such moves highlight Bitcoin‚Äôs increasing role in corporate finance, as inflation fears and economic uncertainty drive more companies to consider alternatives to traditional assets. These proposals could signal a major shift in corporate treasury management, but whether companies like Amazon and Microsoft adopt Bitcoin remains uncertain. As debates continue, the decisions made by these tech giants could significantly influence the future of cryptocurrency adoption in the business world.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/amazon-shareholders-push-for-bitcoin-to-fight-inflation,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37416747.jpeg
37416689,https://crypto.news/?p=14317482,1733733946,DPRK-linked hackers social engineered $50m Radiant Capital exploit: report,"A new postmortem report from Radiant Capital claims a North Korean state-backed hacker was behind the $50 million exploit of the protocol. The attacker impersonated a ‚Äútrusted former contractor‚Äù of Radiant Capital to deploy malware via a ‚Äúzipped PDF‚Äù file shared across the messaging platform Telegram, the report noted, citing findings by cybersecurity firm Mandiant. According to Radiant Capital, the file originated from a ‚ÄúDPRK-aligned threat actor‚Äù believed to be UNC4736, also referred to as Citrine Sleet, and the masterminds behind the AppleJeus malware . Leveraging the contractor‚Äôs prior relationship with Radiant‚Äôs team, the attacker crafted a convincing ruse by spoofing the contractor‚Äôs legitimate domain and sending a Telegram message requesting feedback on a supposed new project related to smart contract auditing. ‚ÄúRequests to review PDFs are routine in professional settings ‚Äî lawyers, smart contract auditors, and partners frequently share documents in this format,‚Äú the report noted, adding that the message did not raise any suspicions and, as a result, was shared with other developers for feedback. The zip file, which appeared to be an after-incident report of the Penpie exploit, actually contained the INLETDRIFT malware, which created a macOS backdoor that allowed the threat actor to compromise the hardware wallets of at least three Radiant developers.

North Korean hackers stole billions in crypto UNC4736 is believed to have ties with the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea‚Äôs Reconnaissance General Bureau and has been known to target cryptocurrency-focused firms. As previously reported by crypto.news, earlier this year, the group targeted crypto financial institutions by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in the Chromium browser to bypass browser security and execute malicious code within the browser‚Äôs sandbox. In September, the Federal Bureau of Investigation warned of the increasingly complex tactics used by North Korean hackers, noting they had taken an interest in targeting individuals linked to crypto exchange-traded funds. A more recent report from researchers at the Cyberwarcon Cybersecurity conference found that North Korean hackers managed to siphon over $10 million in just six months by infiltrating prominent companies as IT workers and other employees. The roughly $3 billion stolen from the crypto sector by these state-backed hacking groups between 2017 and 2023 is allegedly used to finance North Korea‚Äôs nuclear weapons program.

At the moment, all indicators point to a bullish outcome for DOGE, which has seen some analysts anticipate a price of $5 at the peak of this bull run. As outrageous as that might sound, DOGE‚Äôs bullish signal forecasts an impending uptick. DOGE‚Äôs trading volume is now in the $7 billion range, surpassing giants such as Solana. Polygon‚Äôs POL has also started to recover from its previous dip, which saw prices fall below $0.40. POL‚Äôs market cap of $5.2 billion is way below DOGE‚Äôs $ 65 billion; however, that only gives POL a nearly 10x come-up. DOGE and POL aside, Rollblock‚Äôs RBLK crypto presale is inviting, as early buyers raise nearly $7 million. RBLK‚Äôs price has already surged over 310% since the start of the presale, and Rollblock‚Äôs focus on GambleFi has seen analysts anticipate further upside before the launch. Dogecoin‚Äôs ascent is imminent as whales accumulate Once a regular dog-themed meme coin sidelined by everyone in crypto, DOGE is today regarded as the next big crypto as its price nears $1. Since its launch, DOGE has surged over 515,000%, meaning a modest investment of $10 at the start would yield $51,500 today. And it doesn‚Äôt seem like DOGE‚Äôs ascent is slowing down. Its daily trading volume is in the $7 billion range, and analysts anticipate a bullish outbreak of $0.75 as the next target. Polygon (POL) is setting the stage for a bullish resurgence Community sentiment is all the way bullish on POL now that it‚Äôs on a recovery path from a devastating dip of over 45%. At its peak, POL surged to $1.29 right after the transition from its previous ticker symbol‚Äì MATIC. Polygon is slowly gaining the confidence of the bulls after registering an impressive 107% uptick in the last 30 days. It remains to be seen whether POL will retest its $1 peak. Rollblock‚Äôs RBLK is the next big crypto in GambleFi The world of online gambling is booming, and Rollblock is on track to bring it on-chain with its emerging GambleFi platform. Rollblock is essentially a crypto casino with an edge. Its entire infrastructure is built on the blockchain, and every transaction is accounted for in the blockchain. This makes every game provably fair, meaning players can enjoy the various table games without being concerned about the odds of getting manipulated. What‚Äôs more, you can earn RBLK tokens and stake them through Rollblock‚Äôs stacking program for a decent 30% APY. Rollblock is at the intersection of play-to-earn and decentralized finance. While the online gambling niche is booming, existing platforms are disjointed, and most players go through a steep learning curve. Rollblock offers an easily accessible platform with several perks. It boasts a community-centric approach where a percentage of the casino‚Äôs weekly revenue goes back to buy back RBLK from the open market and burn it, thus boosting price ascent. Early buyers of Rollblock have already seen RBLK surge by over 310%, raising nearly $7 million during its crypto presale.

37416639,https://coinpaprika.com/news/crypto-showdown-crenshaw-faces-senate-vote-amid-backlash,1733733805,Crypto Showdown: Crenshaw Faces Senate Vote Amid Backlash,"Caroline Crenshaw, a commissioner of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), faces growing criticism over her strong anti-crypto stance as she approaches a key Senate vote for re-nomination. If confirmed, Crenshaw would remain on the SEC until 2029, a prospect that has sparked intense debate due to her strict views on cryptocurrency regulation and alignment with progressive policies. Crenshaw is widely seen as stricter than SEC Chair Gary Gensler regarding crypto. Critics point to her dissent against approving Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ), which she justified by citing concerns over investor protection and market manipulation . Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart described her as ‚Äúmore anti-crypto than Gensler,‚Äù referencing her January dissent letter, in which she strongly opposed the approval of such ETFs. Notably, her Democratic colleague Jaime Liz√°rraga did not support this stance, highlighting the extremity of her position. The vote for Crenshaw‚Äôs re-nomination by the Senate Banking Committee, scheduled for Wednesday, comes at a pivotal moment for U.S. crypto policy. Republican lawmakers, who now control both chambers of Congress, are signaling a desire for regulatory reforms that encourage innovation. This shift reflects growing dissatisfaction with the SEC‚Äôs strict approach, which many argue hinders the U.S. from becoming a global leader in the cryptocurrency space. Supporters of Crenshaw‚Äôs reappointment praise her focus on protecting investors and promoting stricter climate reporting mandates. However, opponents argue that her policies overburden businesses and deter investment. Critics see her alignment with Gensler as a continuation of an overly aggressive regulatory agenda, prompting concerns about the future of crypto innovation under her watch. Former President Donald Trump and his allies have voiced strong opposition to Crenshaw‚Äôs re-nomination, promising significant changes to U.S. crypto policies if they regain influence. Trump has criticized the SEC‚Äôs current leadership, pledging to reduce unnecessary red tape and create a clear regulatory framework that fosters innovation. Republican Representative Byron Donalds has echoed these sentiments, suggesting that Trump has a systematic plan to appoint qualified officials to lead reform efforts. The outcome of the Senate vote could have far-reaching implications. If Crenshaw is confirmed, the SEC is likely to maintain its strict approach toward crypto regulation. However, if the vote blocks her nomination, it may pave the way for new leadership that could take a more innovation-friendly stance. For now, the crypto industry and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are watching closely, knowing the decision could shape the U.S. role in the global cryptocurrency market for years to come.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/crypto-showdown-crenshaw-faces-senate-vote-amid-backlash,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37416639.jpeg

Both exchanges will open trading for the token at 21:00 KST. Upbit and Bithumb will list utility tokens from Movement Labs , an Ethereum ( ETH ) layer 2 solution, simultaneously on Dec. 9 at 21:00 KST.

Deposits and withdrawals for the token will only be available through the Ethereum network. Upbit sets the minimum sell price limit for MOVE to $0.33 USD or equivalent to 464.5 KRW, which is 30% below the previous day‚Äôs lowest over-the-counter trading price.

However, as the market continues to heat up, investors need to stay cautious. The crypto market is buzzing with momentum as Bitcoin‚Äôs surge sets the stage for altcoin action. Among the many players, Ripple‚Äôs XRP has stood out, driven by a mix of market trends, regulatory updates, and investor sentiment. Let‚Äôs have a closer look at this, shall we? Understanding the Bull Market Crypto investments are seeing a shift as cash rotates into different assets, driving bullish sentiment. But overbought conditions in leveraged and futures markets can be risky. To profit in this environment, investors need a clear understanding of bull market trends and strategic caution.

After over a year, the profits from this investment amounted to $42.81 million. Investors enthusiastic about the up-and-coming FXGuys‚Äô ($FXG) speculate if $FXG can deliver even bigger returns, looking at its rising momentum in its cryptocurrency ICO . The presale has investors flocking to capitalize on its flexibility, massive rewards offerings and proprietary trading propositions. As a result, it has raised nearly $2.8 million in funding, and market experts are optimistic about a bull run for $FXG‚Äôs price after it launches. This article explains the reasons FXGuys could potentially deliver bigger profits than the Pepe‚Äôs whale return. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE Pepe (PEPE): $43 Million in Gains for Major Whale Spotonchain analytics account on the X (previously famous as Twitter) posted about a giant whale who transferred 500 billion PEPE (valued at $11.73 million) to Coinbase. This whale held their PEPE tokens since 2023, having bought 2.01 trillion PEPE worth $2.12 million between May 5 and September 10, 2023. Now, they still hold 1.48 trillion PEPE ($33.2 million), and their estimated total profit is $43 million. Last month, PEPE got listed on Robinhood and Upbit, the biggest cryptocurrency trading platform in South Korea. This resulted in its DeFi coin price soaring to a new all-time high. Over the past week, PEPE is up by 11% and trades around the $0.0000216 level. FX Guys ($FXG): $2.8 Million Raised in Early Presale Phase FXGuys is the fastest-rising decentralized and proprietary trading project in the presale sector. Currently, FXGuys is in Stage 2 of its public presale, offering tokens at $0.04 each, and will see a new price high of $0.05 in the next stage. The $FXG token has attracted significant investor interest, raising about $2.8 million in early funding. Through staking, $FXG holders earn passively by locking their tokens and providing liquidity. They get access to up to 20% of the platform‚Äôs annual return, shared based on their contribution to the staking pool. FXGuys also utilize a Trade2Earn model where users are rewarded $FXG tokens for every trade they make, whether profitable or not. FXGuys‚Äô funding program gives top traders access to funded accounts with up to $500,000, enabling them to trade various asset classes, including crypto, forex, indices, and commodities. The profit is split 80/20 in favor of the traders, with same-day payouts available in over 100 local currencies and crypto. For both new and experienced traders, FX Guys provides resources, real-time insights and guides on trading. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE Conclusion A giant Pepe whale nets $43 million from his investment, a notable 20x return. FXGuys ‚Äô cryptocurrency ICO disrupts the crypto market as it allows for flexibility in the DeFi space as well as more trading volume and reward opportunities for its users. The massive return the Pepe whale accumulated may seem ambitious for FXGuys to mirror, but with FXGuys‚Äô momentum, it can deliver even higher profits, especially for its early backers. FXGuys‚Äô presale offers investors an opportunity to capitalize on its novel decentralized propositions. Tipped for a massive rally following its launch at a DeFi coin price of $0.1, interested investors should purchase their tokens while it‚Äôs still early.

Chainlink has enjoyed a late-week rally, and now needs to climb just +10.8% to match its 3-year high from January, 2022. It is encouraging that there is very little retail FOMO toward LINK.

This ICO Might Be the Second Chance You‚Äôve Been Waiting For,"Do you ever wonder how much your life could‚Äôve changed if you had invested in the early days of cryptocurrencies like Kaspa? Many people look back and realise how one small decision could‚Äôve made a huge difference in their financial future. The good news is that the crypto market isn‚Äôt done with opportunities yet. In fact, some projects today are laying the groundwork for the kind of growth early investors in Bitcoin or Ethereum once saw. Qubetics is one of those projects that has caught the attention of crypto enthusiasts and analysts alike. It‚Äôs offering solutions to real-world challenges with its decentralized VPN (dVPN) service, and this ICO could be the shot you‚Äôve been waiting for. With a growing community and strong fundamentals, Qubetics is shaping up to be one of the best cryptos to buy today. Let‚Äôs dive into why missing out on its presale could be a mistake you don‚Äôt want to make. Qubetics Is Leading the Way in Web3 Innovation Qubetics is not just another name in the crowded crypto market. It‚Äôs a project designed to tackle issues that traditional cryptocurrencies and blockchain platforms have left unresolved. At its core lies a decentralized VPN service that redefines how privacy and security are managed online. This isn‚Äôt just about keeping data safe; it‚Äôs about empowering individuals and businesses by ensuring that no single authority has control over their information. Unlike centralized VPNs that rely on intermediaries to handle user data, Qubetics operates through a peer-to-peer blockchain network. This approach eliminates the risks of data breaches, censorship, and tracking. Businesses that require secure communication can trust Qubetics to protect their operations, while individuals gain unrestricted access to the internet without compromising their anonymity. The decentralized structure ensures that no single entity controls the network, fostering transparency and freedom for users. Participants can also earn $TICS tokens by sharing bandwidth, creating an engaging and rewarding ecosystem. Enhanced security features, like multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption, safeguard sensitive data and ensure user privacy. For instance, a startup working with clients in various parts of the world can rely on Qubetics to bypass geographical restrictions and maintain secure communications, giving them a competitive edge. Similarly, for individuals living in regions with limited internet access, Qubetics serves as a lifeline to connect with the broader world without fear of surveillance or censorship. Why the Presale Matters The Qubetics presale is currently in its 12th stage,. So far, it has sold over 280 million tokens to more than 7000 holders, raising 5 million in the ongoing sale. With each presale stage lasting seven days and ending at midnight every Sunday, prices rise by 10% as the next stage begins. This gives investors a limited window to secure tokens at the current price before the increase. For example, an investment of $5,500 at the current price would secure 194,680 $TICS tokens. By the end of the presale, when $TICS is expected to reach $0.25, those tokens could be worth $48,670‚Äîa return of 783%. Analysts have projected even higher values, with $TICS estimated at $1 post-presale, translating into a 3,434% ROI. If prices climb to $5, that same investment could grow to $973,400, and at $15 post-mainnet launch, it could reach a massive $2.92 million, offering an ROI of 52,912%. With its strong growth potential and innovative features, Qubetics is increasingly being viewed as one of the best cryptos to buy today, offering early investors a chance to maximise their returns. Kaspa Proves the Power of Early Investment Kaspa‚Äôs story is a classic example of why timing matters in crypto. Launched with the aim of creating the fastest proof-of-work blockchain, it drew the attention of developers and investors alike. Kaspa‚Äôs innovative approach to scalability and transaction speed set it apart from competitors. But what truly made it a success was the foresight of those who believed in it during its ICO phase. Back in its early days, Kaspa tokens were available at a fraction of their current value. Investors who got in during the ICO phase have seen exponential growth in their portfolios. Kaspa now stands as a testament to how utility-driven cryptos can flourish in the long run. This is why Qubetics is so intriguing‚Äîit combines the innovation of a Web3 aggregator with practical tools like the dVPN. While Kaspa paved the way for blockchain scalability, Qubetics is doing the same for privacy and decentralization, making it one of the best cryptos to buy today. Conclusion Crypto success often comes down to timing, and for those who missed out on early investments in projects like Kaspa, the Qubetics presale offers a second shot. With its decentralized VPN and strong community backing, Qubetics isn‚Äôt just another crypto‚Äîit‚Äôs a project with real-world impact and incredible growth potential. The presale is moving quickly, and with $TICS prices set to rise every week, this could be your moment to act. Don‚Äôt wait until the presale ends to realise the opportunity you had. If you‚Äôre serious about finding the best cryptos to buy today, Qubetics might just be the chance you‚Äôve been hoping for. Get in now and see how far this journey could take you.

37416261,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=659327,1733733010,"Bitcoin Price Bull Run: Analyst Reveals Why BTC Will Hit Its Top A Month From Now Below $150,000","Crypto analyst Tony Severino has revealed that the Bitcoin price bull run could end as soon as January 2025. The analyst further projected that BTC will top below $150,000 as its bull run ends by next month. Bitcoin Price Could Top By January 2025 Below $150,000 In an X post, Tony Severino reaffirmed his theory that the Bitcoin price could top as soon as January 20, 2025. He shared an accompanying chart showing that BTC follows a textbook example of a ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù market cycle. The chart showed that Bitcoin could top below $150,000 as it reaches the market top next month. Related Reading: Technical Analysis Puts XRP Price Above $5 In Next 3 Days, Whales Buy $288 Worth Of XRP The chart shows that the Bitcoin price is on the last leg of this market cycle‚Äôs motive wave. Once this motive wave is done, possibly as soon as January 2025, the corrective wave of this market cycle will begin. This wave, which ushers in the bear market, could last until mid-2027 and cause BTC to retrace to as low as $50,000. Donald Trump‚Äôs Pro-Crypto Moves May Already Be Priced In In a detailed blog post, Tony Severino provided more insights on why the Bitcoin price bull run could top this early. He noted that Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in the US presidential elections is the narrative that has caused a market-wide takeoff. Thanks to his pro-crypto stance, BTC broke out of a resistance level the night he was declared the winner and has since rallied to $100,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Breaks Above Massive Triangle ‚Äì Next Target: $10,000 However, Severino remarked that Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto world is the new paradigm this time around. He acknowledged that market participants cannot envisage a world where the Bitcoin price doesn‚Äôt rise much higher, considering that the president-elect has promised to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which could create a lot of FOMO among other nation-states. However, the crypto analyst asked market participants to consider the fact that the Efficient Market Hypothesis says that the market is forward-looking and prices in all information the moment it is available. Severino believes that BTC could have already priced into Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto moves. If so, he predicts this ‚Äúnew paradigm‚Äù could create the perfect atmosphere of euphoria and a cyclical peak when Trump finally takes office. In other words, Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration could mark the top for the Bitcoin price bull run, and the corrective wave could begin as soon as he takes office. The Last Two ‚ÄòNew Paradigm‚Äô Became Cycle Peaks Tony Severino alluded to what happened the last two times the term ‚Äúnew paradigm‚Äù was regularly used. According to him, those events became the cyclical peaks for the Bitcoin price. First, he noted that when CME Futures were about to launch, many expected that the fact that institutions could have exposure to BTC would bring a lot of capital. However, that wasn‚Äôt the case, as it kicked off a bear market instead. The same thing happened with Coinbase going public, sparking optimism that the Bitcoin price could easily cruise to $100,000. However, that wasn‚Äôt the case, as that event marked the cyclical peak for the Bitcoin price bull run. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $99,200, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

37416055,https://thecoinrise.com/amazon-urged-to-adopt-bitcoin-treasury-strategy-in-shareholder-proposal/,1733732556,Amazon Urged to Adopt Bitcoin Treasury Strategy in Shareholder Proposal,"The National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a Washington DC-based think tank advocating for free-market solutions, has submitted a shareholder proposal urging Amazon to incorporate Bitcoin into its corporate treasury strategy. The proposal is set to be discussed during the tech giant‚Äôs April 2025 shareholder meeting. The NCPPR argues that traditional inflation metrics, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), significantly underestimate the erosion of purchasing power. While the CPI currently reports inflation at 4.95%, the proposal suggests the real figure could be twice as high. This inflation, they claim, is eating away at Amazon‚Äôs $88 billion in cash reserves. Bitcoin, with its deflationary nature and historical performance, is suggested as a hedge to safeguard shareholder value. ‚ÄúOver the past year, Bitcoin has appreciated by 131%, vastly outperforming corporate bonds. Over five years, it has surged by 1,246%,‚Äù the proposal states, highlighting Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a superior store of value compared to traditional financial instruments. MicroStrategy‚Äôs Example The proposal draws inspiration from MicroStrategy, a pioneer in the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy. Since initiating its Bitcoin accumulation, MicroStrategy‚Äôs holdings have swelled to a value exceeding $40 billion, with the company realizing a profit of approximately $17 billion. The strategy has gained traction among other corporations as well. In November 2024, mining firm MARA, previously known as Marathon Digital, raised $1 billion through a 0% interest convertible note offering to acquire 6,474 BTC for its treasury . Similarly, AI company Genius Group recently converted its treasury assets into Bitcoin, purchasing 110 BTC at an average price of $90,932 each. These examples underscore the growing adoption of Bitcoin as a corporate asset amid mounting inflation fears. A Call to Action for Amazon Future The NCPPR recommends that Amazon allocate at least 5% of its treasury assets to Bitcoin, citing its proven ability to outpace inflation and preserve capital. While Amazon has yet to comment publicly on the proposal , the move signals increasing pressure on major corporations to consider Bitcoin‚Äôs role in mitigating inflationary risks. If adopted, Amazon could join the ranks of firms reaping the benefits of Bitcoin‚Äôs performance, setting a precedent for other corporate giants in navigating the challenges of a depreciating dollar. As inflation concerns persist, Bitcoin‚Äôs appeal as a hedge against economic uncertainty continues to grow.

Overview of Next Week‚Äôs Key Economic Events Inflation Data The Consumer Inflation Expectations for November will be released by the New York Federal Reserve on December 9, 2024. In October, this figure dropped to 2.9%, the lowest level since October 2020, after staying at 3% for over four months. For November, Trading Economics forecasts a slight increase back to 3.0%. On December 11, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for November will be released. October‚Äôs CPI rose to 315.644, up from 315.3 in September. The forecast for November remains unchanged at 315.3 points. The Producer Price Index (PPI) for November will be released on December 12. In October, the PPI reached a record high of 145.615, up from 145.329 in September.

In October, the export index increased by 0.8%, exceeding expectations of a 0.1% decline. For November, forecasts range from a 0.3% decrease to a 0.9% increase. Meanwhile, the import index rose by 0.3% in October after a 0.4% decline in September, with November predictions ranging from -0.3% to +0.2%. Strong export price growth typically signals a healthy economy, which could make cryptocurrencies less attractive as an investment. However, higher import prices could raise inflation concerns, increasing the demand for cryptocurrencies as a hedge. The crypto market‚Äôs response will be closely watched, with each data release adding fuel to an already volatile fire. FAQs How do inflation data impact cryptocurrency prices?

FTM: Using 1,267.5 WSTETH ($5.83 million), the whale purchased 4.547 million FTM at an average price of $1.282, resulting in a $307,000 (+5.27%) gain. 3. AERO: The whale spent 445.05 WSTETH ($2.14 million) to buy 1.369 million AERO at an average price of $1.564, yielding the most significant gain of $830,000 (+38%). A big whale spent 420 $WSTETH ($2M) to buy 1.47M $FTM in a single transaction 2 hours ago! Notably, over the past 6 days, this whale has spent a total of $19M worth of $ETH to buy: ‚Ä¢ 531.7B $PEPE ($11.04M), now up $292K (+2.6%) ‚Ä¢ 4.55M $FTM ($5.83M), now up $353K (+6%) ‚Ä¢‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/P8OIE2ZLMx ‚Äî Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) December 7, 2024 Currently, the whale retains 4,058 WSTETH, valued at $19.27 million, across the two wallets, hinting at more potential market moves. This activity highlights the whale‚Äôs strategy of leveraging significant capital to acquire promising tokens, often securing immediate returns. With substantial funds still in reserve, the question arises: which token will this whale target next? Such moves underline the impact of high-net-worth traders in shaping market dynamics.

37415932,https://coinpedia.org/?p=390883,1733732172,Czech Republic Is Now Crypto-Friendly! Here‚Äôs What Changed,"The post Czech Republic Is Now Crypto-Friendly! Here‚Äôs What Changed appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Czech Republic has made the news headlines with bold new crypto regulations aimed at transforming the sector. These changes address long-standing challenges for crypto businesses and could make the country a hotspot for digital asset innovation. Let‚Äôs explore what these reforms mean for the industry. Crypto Firms Finally Get a Break Crypto businesses in the Czech Republic have long struggled to open bank accounts due to skepticism from financial institutions. Banks, wary of crypto‚Äôs volatility , often denied these businesses basic banking services, making operations incredibly challenging. That‚Äôs about to change. The new reforms will make it easier for crypto companies to access banking services, removing a major barrier to growth. This shift could pave the way for smoother operations and attract more businesses to the Czech market. Hodle≈ôi pozor. Ve Snƒõmovnƒõ jsme schv√°lili ƒçasov√Ω i hodnotov√Ω test pro kryptomƒõny.

A three-year tax exemption for crypto investments has also been introduced. This means that profits from crypto will be treated just like profits from stocks. So, crypto businesses can breathe a little easier, knowing they‚Äôre now on the same playing field as more traditional investments. It‚Äôs a big win, and it‚Äôs meant to make the Czech market way more attractive to investors‚Äîboth local and international. Why Act Now? The Clock‚Äôs Ticking Deputy Speaker Jan Skopeƒçek explained the need for swift action, emphasizing that the government had to act now to retain crypto businesses. Without these changes, many companies could relocate to countries with more favorable crypto laws, leading to economic losses. The urgency also ties to the European Union‚Äôs upcoming Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation. While MiCA aims to harmonize crypto rules across the EU, its rollout has caused uncertainty. Many companies are still awaiting approvals or navigating compliance challenges, and some have already left Europe or modified their operations to align with the evolving rules. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Today (Dec 09th 2024): Bitcoin Holds $99k | LINK Leads Top 100 Gainers , The Road Ahead Is Not Easy These reforms show the Czech Republic‚Äôs determination to stay ahead in the digital revolution.

37415887,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98569,1733732106,Microsoft Could Invest Over $100 Billion In Bitcoin If This Happens,"As Bitcoin continues to play hide-and-seek with its major $100,000 valuation, tech giant Microsoft is all set to vote on investing in it, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was widely regarded as a viral nuisance by many of these ‚Äúserious tech companies‚Äù until a few years ago. However, developments afterward have forced them to change their stance towards the crypto sector, especially BTC itself. Shareholders to Decide Investing in Bitcoin According to a press communique from Microsoft‚Äôs PR firm, the tech company‚Äôs shareholders are set to vote on a proposal to invest in digital currency on December 10. This is expected to be a major watershed moment for the tech sector and the crypto economy, as it would result in other IT firms following suit. Even more interesting is that Microsoft‚Äôs board is against specific investments in the digital currency economy. The governing body stated on record that the company has already evaluated and invested in a wide range of assets, including BTC itself. So, there is no need for a specific allocation for it. Bill Gates Opposes Move The company‚Äôs stance is in line with its founder Bill Gates‚Äô views, who has consistently criticized the digital asset sector over the years. According to Gates, Bitcoin‚Äôs speculative nature and the environmental challenges it poses make it a less compelling financial instrument. However, the shareholders may not see it this way and can vote to overrule the board and Gates himself, who owns a large chunk of the company. $100 Billion into Bitcoin? If Microsoft decides to invest in Bitcoin , it could propel the crypto economy upwards even more. According to the latest filings, the company behind Windows and Office software has cash reserves and liquid assets worth over $78 billion. A large chunk of this money could end up in Bitcoin. The firm‚Äôs involvement may cause a snowball effect in the IT industry, potentially pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into this economy. Michael Saylor and Microstrategy could be dwarfed soon enough by these big players in the near future. For traders, 10 December is going to be a major event, as they will be crossing their fingers for a positive outcome. In that scenario, expect the top crypto to make a solid move above $100k.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/microsoft-could-invest-over-100-billion-in-bitcoin-if-this-happens/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Trump‚Äôs Tesla (TRUMTESLA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMTESLA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump‚Äôs Tesla can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump‚Äôs Tesla could become the next viral memecoin. Trump‚Äôs Tesla launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump‚Äôs Tesla on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump‚Äôs Tesla by entering its contract address ‚Äì 8T1qq1DxSqWqoR8J9hi3ULGCCoMJdqQBev4WAvJg9awR ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMTESLA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trumps-tesla-trumtesla-solana-memecoin-will-explode-15000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37416793,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51700,1733731122,When Elon Musk Disclosed How Much Shiba Inu (SHIB) He Holds,"Elon Musk, the tech billionaire and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is no stranger to the cryptocurrency market. In late 2020, he revealed he holds Dogecoin (DOGE), a meme-inspired digital currency. Musk‚Äôs association with Dogecoin significantly influenced its price, propelling it to new heights. From November 2020 to May 2021, DOGE skyrocketed from $0.002 to $0.73, marking an astounding 36,500% increase within six months. This surge turned the cryptocurrency into a profitable investment for countless market participants. Elon Musk‚Äôs enthusiasm for Dogecoin extended beyond mere ownership. He frequently tweeted about the cryptocurrency, referred to it as ‚Äúthe people‚Äôs currency,‚Äù and even dedicated an episode of Saturday Night Live (SNL), titled The Dogefather, to discuss it. His advocacy for Dogecoin introduced millions of new investors to cryptocurrencies, further driving interest in the sector. Around the same time, another meme-based cryptocurrency began gaining attention: Shiba Inu (SHIB). With its rapid ascent, Shiba Inu became a notable competitor to Dogecoin, sparking a division among meme token enthusiasts. Between 2020 and 2021, SHIB experienced an unprecedented rise of 85,000,000% (85 million percent), making it a standout asset during the bull run. This dramatic performance spurred curiosity among investors about whether Musk, who had endorsed Dogecoin so heavily, had also invested in Shiba Inu. Did Elon Musk Invest in Shiba Inu (SHIB)? Speculation regarding Musk‚Äôs potential involvement in Shiba Inu reached its peak during the 2021 cryptocurrency rally. Some even theorized that Musk might be the mysterious founder of Shiba Inu. These rumors prompted one user on X to ask if he holds SHIB. ‚ÄúHey, Elon Musk, how much SHIB you are holding?‚Äù the user inquired. Musk responded succinctly, ‚ÄúNone.‚Äù This statement clarified that the Tesla CEO does not hold Shiba Inu (SHIB). Furthermore, Musk confirmed that his cryptocurrency portfolio includes only three assets: Dogecoin, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. His transparency dispelled rumors of any involvement with SHIB. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Rivalry Between Dogecoin and Shiba Inu (SHIB) The rivalry between Dogecoin and Shiba Inu was visible during the bull run, as their communities often clashed on social media. Supporters of both tokens engaged in debates about the merits of their chosen cryptocurrency, fostering a competitive environment in the meme-token market. While Dogecoin had the advantage of Musk‚Äôs endorsement and widespread recognition as a ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs currency,‚Äù Shiba Inu gained traction for its meteoric rise in value and grassroots community-driven initiatives. Both tokens significantly influenced the meme-coin segment, attracting mainstream attention and new investors. While Musk remains a pivotal figure in cryptocurrency, his portfolio is limited to Dogecoin, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. His public disavowal of Shiba Inu highlights his focus on specific assets, despite the rampant speculation surrounding his influence in the broader cryptocurrency market.

37415410,https://coinpedia.org/?p=390807,1733731007,Forget Shiba Inu and Dogecoin; 1FUEL Is Poised to Be the Millionaire-Making Coin of 2025!,"The post Forget Shiba Inu and Dogecoin; 1FUEL Is Poised to Be the Millionaire-Making Coin of 2025! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the last bull run, memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and even Shiba Inu (SHIB) made investors sudden wealth with early investment. It‚Äôs no longer realistic to expect meteoric rises like that with the same coins. However, 1FUEL , a promising new altcoin currently in presale, gives savvy investors the chance to turn pennies into millions by 2025 with 500X gains. Let‚Äôs see why 1FUEL is one of the top crypto presales of 2024 and why you should consider adding this token to your portfolio. Shiba Inu Has Shown Impressive Resilience In 2024 As one of the fastest-growing memecoins in the market, Shiba Inu (SHIB) just doesn‚Äôt seem to slow down. Frequently likened to Dogecoin (DOGE), SHIB has cleverly walked its own path, sitting at $0.00003278, with a market cap of $19.32 billion, making it a real player in the cryptosphere. Often referred to as a meme coin, Shiba Inu offers functionalities that go beyond hype, contributing to its emerging adoption. SHIB has increased by 20.45% in the past 24 hours and 31.19% in the last seven days. And has jumped up 82.62% over the past month. But like many cryptocurrencies, SHIB‚Äôs volatility is a concern. It has delivered huge short-term profits for some investors, but future performance is anything but certain. Those in pursuit of more reliable, long-term ways to build wealth beyond meme coins are turning towards alternatives such as 1FUEL, which are poised to redefine how we generate wealth. Why Dogecoin Remains A Hotspot Going by market capitalization, the largest meme coin is Dogecoin (DOGE). Though rooted in fun, DOGE has become so popular it has risen to the top of the pack as a key player in the crypto market. DOGE is trading near a major resistance area at $0.4500. Its market cap has jumped 450% from its lowest this year to over $65 billion. In a week, its time-weighted price has increased by 2.72%, and in a month, an eye-popping 169.99%. Analysts are optimistic that the ongoing consolidation could be the momentum-gathering stage before the coin jumps to $1. Experts predict that the coin may soon have a strong bullish breakout in the next few days. A likely catalyst for the DOGE price will be the ongoing Bitcoin (BTC) rally now that first broke a key resistance at $100,000 before dipping. Higher BTC prices often lead to more interest in low-priced meme coins. Can 1Fuel Be A New Millionaire Maker In 2025? As the DeFi ecosystem evolves, investors are popularizing a new privacy-centric next-generation wallet. 1FUEL is one of the most popular tokens on presale now. The new altcoin‚Äôs promising future has attracted top investors as one of the top crypto presales of 2024. With its one-click cross-chain transactions, this wallet is set to change the game in digital asset management. Some of these potential successes are deeply tied to the value 1FUEL offers. This innovative wallet simplifies managing transactions and portfolios, provides market insights, and rewards users with various incentives. What really sets 1FUEL apart is its 30% APR rewards and its advanced technology. Under the hood automation will also remove transaction complications, making it transparent for users. In fact, 1FUEL will also include a privacy mixer feature and cold storage technology positioning it as one of the best cryptos to invest in 2024. With these features, investors are able to control their money and protect their identity. Join the 1FUEL presale now because it is limited in supply and has 500X return potential. Only 500 million tokens are available. Going by the present pace of accumulation, the token price will not be at $0.01 for long. The more the presale proceeds, the higher the token‚Äôs value will go. So, the entry point is now for investors who seek maximum profit. Conclusion While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) forecasts are bullish in the short term. They may not give the desired sustainable returns for investors seeking significant, long-term wealth creation. Experts believe in 1fuels potential to likely deliver 500X returns by 2025. Given the present pace of accumulation, the 500 million tokens will not last long. Join the 1FUEL presale now, as experts predict it will become the best cryptos to invest in 2024.

As the market matures, investors are prioritizing initiatives with high usefulness and long-term growth potential. Rexas Finance (RXS), a $0.125 rising star, promises to reinvent asset tokenization and open new financial opportunities. SHIB may rise because of its active community and speculative enthusiasm, but RXS will outperform it in the next bull market. Rexas Finance is a game-changer ready to overthrow meme coins like SHIB with its strong ecosystem for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, cutting-edge DeFi protocols, and a clear scalability roadmap. Shiba Inu: A Progressive Market Trend Shiba Inu (SHIB) is gaining cryptocurrency attention again as its price action rises. Market analyst Javon Marks expects SHIB to rise as the meme coin verifies a bull pattern. Due to strong technical indicators, Marks expects SHIB to rise 179% to $0.000081. According to veteran analyst Ali Martinez, SHIB must overcome the $0.000025 resistance range to reach $0.000037.

The platform‚Äôs CertiK audit, a blockchain security benchmark, ensures transparency and prevents fraud, boosting investor confidence. In the competitive DeFi market, RXS‚Äôs careful security and credibility give it an edge. SHIB‚Äôs positive streak may entice short-term investors, but Rexas Finance is more lasting and influential.

Table of Contents Solana is consolidating just below the $240 resistance. Tron enters re-accumulation phase after reaching ATH Cutoshi is the new star in the meme coin galaxy Solana (SOL) appears ready for the next leg up as large buyers continue to snipe the bottoms and add more SOL to their already massive positions. Meanwhile, Tron (TRX) and Cutoshi (CUTO) are also teasing new breakouts that could send them soaring in the upcoming weeks. Cutoshi, in particular, has been capturing the attention of crypto veterans and meme enthusiasts. With its revolutionary MemeFi ecosystem, Cutoshi could soon redefine the entire meme coin space and become one of the hottest plays of 2025. Solana is consolidating just below the $240 resistance. Solana continues to play a protagonist role in the current crypto market with its $113 billion market cap that puts it at the 5th place on the crypto totem pole. Solana has been range bound over the past two weeks after it reached a new all-time high of $263. Following a retracement, Solana revisited lower levels and every dip was scooped, showing sustained buyer interest. On-chain tracker Lookonchain has drawn attention to a significant surge in whale activity over the week. 4 large Solana wallets have withdrawn around 185,000 SOL tokens from Binance, worth approximately $42 million. Moreover, Solana continues to benefit immensely from the ongoing meme season, as its meme coin factory is working overtime, with tens of new projects launching every day. Although their utility is questionable, to say the least, it‚Äôs undeniable that this euphoria is funneling insane revenue numbers back into Solana‚Äôs ecosystem. This is also significant for meme coins that provide a real use case, such as Cutoshi, built on Ethereum blockchain, for example. As this meme cycle is maturing, investors are now looking to rotate capital into utility-driven narratives built to thrive in the long run.

Even throughout the turbulent summer months, Tron demonstrated surprising stability and in November it surged by over 150%, reaching a new all-time high of $0.43. As traders booked profits, Tron experienced a pullback and is now selling for $0.31 with a 3.8% intraday decrease. Right now, Tron is regaining strength as it is constantly tapping into a high-demand zone around the $0.30 mark. Trader and analyst Mihir points out that this latest peak in Tron‚Äôs price coincides with an ascending trendline where previous cycles‚Äô highs line up. This trendline has acted as a dynamic resistance level and if Tron breaks out, it could enter escape velocity and surge above $1 in the upcoming months. Cutoshi is the new star in the meme coin galaxy Cutoshi comes into play at the meeting point between memes and DeFi. The project introduces a cutting-edge decentralized platform, CUTO DEX, which bridges the gap between isolated blockchains and allows users to instantly swap between assets. Cutoshi draws inspiration from the Lucky Cats in Japanese folklore. These cats are believed to bring good fortune to businesses. Cutoshi tokenizes luck and brings it to the blockchain so that early investors can reap the rewards. Cutoshi will offer monetary incentives to users for staking the CUTO token or providing liquidity. Moreover, community members will have the opportunity to complete fun tasks and quests and earn additional income through the Cutoshi Farming initiative. Stage 4 of the presale is now live and CUTO is priced at just $0.031. This is the perfect point for early buyers who want to be on the winning side of the new, utility-driven meme coin project.

Bitcoin‚Äôs ( BTC ) rise past $100,000 has sparked excitement, though Russian investors aren‚Äôt counting on it hitting $200,000 this cycle, according to analysts polled by Russia‚Äôs state news agency TASS. They estimate Bitcoin could climb as high as $160,000 but don‚Äôt see it doubling its current price anytime soon. As for the reason behind Bitcoin‚Äôs recent growth, analysts point to macroeconomic changes, such as the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate cuts after a prolonged tightening phase, along with rising global liquidity and inflation concerns, which have driven investors to scarce assets like Bitcoin. Institutional adoption is also a major factor, with companies like MicroStrategy and BlackRock quickly building up their Bitcoin holdings. In early December, MicroStrategy doubled down on its crypto strategy, acquiring 15,400 BTC for $1.5 billion, with an average purchase price of $95,976 per coin. With the latest acquisition, MicroStrategy‚Äôs crypto holdings now stand at approximately 402,100 BTC, valued at nearly $40 billion. At the same time, Bitcoin options and exchange-traded funds are gaining more attention, with the latter nearing $113 billion in total net assets, per data from SoSoValue. Despite the enthusiasm, analysts remain cautious about Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term outlook. Some see two possible scenarios: a ‚Äúconservative target‚Äù of $130,000 and a more optimistic ceiling of $160,000 by mid-summer 2025. However, they agree that a $200,000 level, if reached, will likely not occur in the current cycle.

With the index nearing its dot-com-era peak valuation, Hartnett predicts an ‚Äúovershoot‚Äù for Bitcoin and stocks in early 2025. Meanwhile, Bitcoin‚Äôs rise continues, with reports indicating that top tech giants are considering adding it to their balance sheets. As crypto.news previously reported , the National Center for Public Policy Research, an independent conservative think tank based in Washington D.C., has suggested that Amazon consider adding Bitcoin to its strategic reserve. The proposal aims to use the company‚Äôs $88 billion in cash and cash equivalents, which includes U.S. government, corporate, and foreign bonds, to include Bitcoin in its reserve by the next annual meeting in April 2025.

37414372,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=659189,1733728798,MOG Meme Coin Rockets After Coinbase Announcement ‚Äì Other Meme Coins to Watch,"MOG is a popular meme token launched on Ethereum‚Äôs layer-1 blockchain. Since this currency is purely driven by community and internet hype, it‚Äôs very volatile and difficult to predict. However, with the recent Coinbase announcement, MOG is expected to see some major growth. On December 3, Coinbase announced that MOG would be added to its listing roadmap. Soon after that, its value increased by more than 20%, bringing its total market cap close to $1 billion. It is now ranked among one of the top 150 currencies in the industry. This is the best time to invest in MOG coins before it gets too late. In the meantime, we also have some other coin recommendations that are expected to go through a similar surge very soon. Do check those out. 4 Other Meme Coins To Keep An Eye On If you feel you‚Äôve missed the MOG rally, here are four other meme coins with good potential returns. 1. Cat Slap Cat Slap , whose official token is SLAP, is going through some massive growth right now. It is an Ethereum-based meme coin inspired by the angry cat-slapping meme. Within the first 48 hours of being listed, its value jumped by 2000%. Right now, its total market cap is $33 million. Yes, it‚Äôs less but that makes it all the more investment-worthy. Tokens with high market cap often hit a saturation point, reducing the chances of making massive profits. What makes this the best time to invest in $SLAP is that it recently received an investment from Jump Trading ‚Äì one of the most respected crypto trading firms. This might push SLAP‚Äôs value even higher. So invest before it‚Äôs too late. 2. Wall Street Pepe Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) is another popular token that‚Äôs trending at the moment. Currently in its presale phase, the token has already raised over $2.57 million in just one week. Given its current popularity, experts predict that its value will exponentially increase over the next few years. Right now, they are priced at $0.000205 each. By the end of 2024, it can go up to $0.000221. The real growth will start in 2025 when this token is expected to hit an average price of $0.001094, which is a 500% jump from its current average price. So if you really want to multiply your profit, invest while the prices are still low. 3. POPCAT POPCAT has also had a very positive year. For those who don‚Äôt know, this is a cat meme token, inspired by a viral cat named Oatmeal. It‚Äôs currently listed at $1.64. It was launched in December last year but it wasn‚Äôt until March 2024 that it started getting attention. After that, it has been an entirely uphill journey. Within 7 months, it grew by 400%. If it continues at this rate, we can easily expect a jump of more than 450% in 2025. 4. Flockerz Flockerz is another popular meme token that‚Äôs trending at the moment. It‚Äôs a type of vote-to-earn platform where users can earn FLOCK tokens by voting on simple decisions. For instance, let‚Äôs say they ask the users whether Flockerz should be listed on a certain exchange. Users can vote yes or no, and regardless of the outcome, they will receive some tokens. 25% of the total token supply is kept for such rewards. The rest are for sales, which, by the way, is going pretty well. The presale of its tokens is ongoing, and it has already raised over $4 million from early investors. Some expert analysts also believe that once the tokens are finally launched on an exchange, it could make some investors millionaires overnight. The Right Time to Invest Bitcoin recently crossed the $100,000 mark and the entire crypto market is now heated up. Whatever tokens go on presale right now has a much higher chance of experiencing exponential growth by 2025. So if you have missed out on the MOG frenzy, remember you still have 4 amazing opportunities to cash into. It‚Äôs always recommended to do your own research before investing your hard-earned money.

37414297,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373472,1733728715,Santa Rally for Bitcoin Price This December? 5 Big BTC Supports,"Is this December a good time to buy Bitcoin? Some say there‚Äôs no gift like the present, especially during the year-end holiday season. Because that‚Äôs when equities and cryptocurrencies historically deliver most of their positive yearly returns. ‚ÄúA Santa Claus rally is the sustained increase in the stock market that occurs around the Christmas holiday on Dec. 25,‚Äù an entry on Investopedia last year reports . ‚ÄúMost estimate these rallies happen in the week leading up to the Christmas holiday, while others see trends that begin Christmas Day through Jan. 2.‚Äù But it‚Äôs not just the seasonal bump going for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets this month. There are also broad macro trends in the little orange coin‚Äôs favor. Meanwhile, there are fundamentals in BTC‚Äôs supply on-chain and on exchanges. To top that off, the Trump bump for most equities and crypto assets after his historical election win is very real. Given his pro-growth agenda for cryptocurrency, markets expect that to weigh heavily in Bitcoin‚Äôs favor as his administration gears up. Here are five reasons Bitcoin bulls expect BTC‚Äôs price to rally further through December and into the New Year. 1. Fed Expects to Cut Rates Again in Dec Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin usually rally over the long term during low Federal Reserve interest rate regimes, in addition to corporate sales and stocks. With rates held down to near 0% for years after the financial crisis of ‚Äô08, Bitcoin grew in leaps and bounds from nothing to $20,000 per BTC by Dec. 25, 2017. Then, when the Fed raised rates through 2018, Bitcoin‚Äôs price collapsed into what markets called the ‚Äúcrypto winter.‚Äù After that, the Fed cut rates to zero again in response to the global coronavirus pandemic in 2020. That led to new all-time high prices for BTC and many altcoins. Then the central bank went back to raising interest rates at the beginning of 2022. Now that the Fed is back to cutting rates again, Bitcoin has roared with bullish approval. The price is flying past new all-time highs in December and shows no signs of slowing down. Daily exchange volume has increased in pace with the higher prices. A top Fed official said at the beginning of December that the Fed is ready to cut rates again at its December meeting on the 17th and 18th. ‚ÄúAt present, I lean toward supporting a cut to the policy rate at our December meeting,‚Äù said Christopher Waller, a key Federal Reserve official. 2. Bitcoin Supply Cycle In Mid-Swing Straight Up #Bitcoin Cycles Timeline. I don‚Äôt make the rules. 2016-2020 Halving to Peak: 525 days Peak to Bottom: 364 days Bottom to Halving 518 days 2020-2024 Halving to Peak: 532 days Peak to Bottom: 371 days Bottom to Halving: 532 Days The next halving date is March 26, 2028. Look how‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/0305klH4WQ ‚Äî Brett (@brett_eth) December 7, 2024 The dovish Fed rate regime is bullish for Bitcoin, but the supply cycle is also heavily in favor of BTC bulls. Hard-coded into Bitcoin Core, the app for running Bitcoin, is a 50% cut in daily new supplies every four years. That‚Äôs akin to the Fed raising its rates every four years, which would make each dollar stronger in purchasing power as time goes on. Instead, the Fed lowers its rates to make each dollar weaker so consumers and businesses will spend faster and make up the difference with economic growth. However, Bitcoin is designed to increase the spending power of its long-term holders. Rather than increasing its new supplies and decreasing its buying power, BTC decreases the new supply rate to shore up and consolidate its buying power. 3. Nov Blowout in Crypto Exchange BTC Outflows While the daily new supplies in Bitcoin fell by half earlier this year, the availability of BTC tokens to trade on crypto exchanges has also drastically declined. That drop in exchange liquidity is a strong price support for Bitcoin over the long term. 30-day crypto exchange outflows topped 58,440 BTC (worth $5.58 billion at the time) on Tuesday, Dec. 3, according to data from CoinGlass. By Dec. 7, just four days later, that trailing 30-day figure had risen by an extreme amount to 116,259 BTC. That represents conviction among long-term holders and the intention to save rather than cash out their Bitcoin. 4. The EOY Sales Bump Most businesses blow out their annual revenue quotas only in the final stretch of the calendar between Nov. 1 and New Year‚Äôs Eve. The New York stock market is no different and neither is Web3‚Äôs Bitcoin blockchain. According to an article in Nasdaq, a popular website for stock market traders, ‚ÄúHistorically, Q4 is Bitcoin‚Äôs strongest quarter, and November has often been a standout month. December, which has also performed well in past bull cycles, presents a promising outlook.‚Äù In terms of its total dollar increase, Bitcoin‚Äôs price rose further in one month this past November than any month in its history. That portends a strong Santa Claus rally if market sentiment remains unchanged through the new year. 5. Pro-Bitcoin Republicans Hold Washington Donald Trump tolerated Bitcoin in his first term. In his second term, he‚Äôs pushing for government understanding and pro-growth regulations that leave room for more innovation in blockchain. A Dec. 6 segment on CNBC, a popular news outlet for the financial and investing class, highlighted the bevy of pro-crypto nominations for Trump‚Äôs second administration. As the incoming president made his selections, Bitcoin‚Äôs price on crypto exchanges hovered near a historic high of around $100,000. As Mr. Trump said in a speech to the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, TN, in July, while campaigning for the presidential election in November, ‚ÄúThose who say that Bitcoin is a threat to the dollar have the story exactly backward.‚Äù The post Santa Rally for Bitcoin Price This December? 5 Big BTC Supports appeared first on CryptoPotato .",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/santa-rally-for-bitcoin-price-this-december-5-big-btc-supports/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/37414297.jpeg
37414250,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=659180,1733728587,4 Altcoins Poised for 10x Gains After Bitcoin Crosses $100K,"The year is ending on a good note for Bitcoin. On December 4 (Wednesday), the cryptocurrency officially crossed the $100K mark. It now stands at $103,449.70. Overall this year the currency witnessed a 130% growth. Experts believe that Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in the presidential elections has been a driving force behind this massive surge. Ever since he started campaigning, he made it clear that his administration has some special plans to uplift the crypto market in the US. But Bitcoin‚Äôs success isn‚Äôt Bitcoin‚Äôs alone. It has huge implications for other currencies too. Here are four other currencies that have the potential of 10x gains in the near future. 4 Altcoins That Can Potential Grow By 10X Let‚Äôs now look at 4 Altcoins you can think about investing your money in. 1. Wall Street Pepe Wall Street Pepe is a trending crypto project ideal for beginners Its official token is called $WEPE and is inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme. As per expert predictions its value is expected to increase throughout the next couple of years. Right now, $WEPE is in presale and we think it‚Äôll continue to be in presale till the end of December. It is currently priced at $0.000221. By the end of next year, it‚Äôs expected to grow by 500%, priced at approximately $0.001094. Now, 2026 is far away and it‚Äôs hard to predict its growth by then. But if everything goes well, we can expect another 10x gain. It also offers a respite from the large whale groups that try to control the crypto market. Small traders can benefit from its special tips and market insights that are exclusively reserved for its community members 2. Crypto All-Stars Crypto All-Stars is a trending microcap meme coin and its native tokens are called $STARS. In August this year, it launched its presale which quickly went viral and has now surpassed over $2 million in sales. This is enough proof of its demand and potential. Now speaking of its expected growth, its current average price is $0.0034067. In 2025, it is expected to go through growth of more than 500% and settle at approximately $0.0217182. $STARS is the proprietary meme coin of MemeVault, the popular meme NFT trading platform. It runs on the ERC-1155 standard, which allows users to integrate MemeVault into Ethereum-based dApps. 3. POPCAT POPCAT is another popular meme coin that is inspired by the viral cat meme featuring a cat called Oatmeal. It‚Äôs a little more expensive than the first two currencies. In October this year, it hit its all-time high value of $1.67 and has since managed to cross the half-a-billion-dollar market cap milestone. POPCAT was first launched in December 2023 but it didn‚Äôt gain much traction until March this year. And since then, over a mere 7 months, it has managed to grow by 400% ‚Äì its current rate is $1.64. At this rate, by the end of December, its rate can go as high as $4.95 (a growth of 200%) and in 2025, it can peak at $9.65, which is a staggering 478% jump from its current value. 4. PNUT PNUT represents Peanut the Squirrel, the beloved internet mascot that was euthanized this October for rabies testing (the result came back negative). This token is a tribute to him. As you can see, this coin is very new to the market. However, since Peanut was popular and the whole incident garnered a lot of controversy, the token quickly became popular. In fact, in less than 48 hours, its market cap crossed the $1 billion mark, the credit for which also goes to it being listed on Binance. Its current trading value is $1.45. By the end of December, if it continues to receive the same level of support from the community, it might reach $2.7 to $3, which is a 106% jump at max. Wall Street Pepe Poised to Explode 10x investors are keeping an eye on these currencies and predict fairly good growth rate for the next year. However, if you want the best of the lot, Wall Street Pepe and Crypto All-Stars are the clear choices. Both of them are cheaper which makes them perfect for small investors to get the best bang out of their buck.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/meme-coins/4-altcoins-poised-for-10x-gains-after-bitcoin-crosses-100k/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

The trend has exploded over the past few years, with coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu leading the charge as alternative investments to traditional financial instruments. As 2024 nears its close, the hype around meme coins continues to build, with many investors eager to jump on the next big thing. One meme coin that‚Äôs turning heads in December 2024 is BTFD Coin. This next-gen meme coin has already raised over $1.1 million in its presale, hitting the $1.5M mark in under 15 days. Now, in Stage 8 of its presale journey, BTFD Coin has sold more than 30 billion $BTFD coins to over 3,300 holders. Its rapid rise has sparked comparisons to other meme coins that have exploded in the market in recent years, such as Turbo and Fartcoin, both of which have earned their place as go-to projects for investors looking for high-reward opportunities. But the question on everyone‚Äôs mind is: Can BTFD Coin follow in the footsteps of Turbo and Fartcoin, both of which have provided substantial returns for early investors? In this article, we‚Äôll explore why BTFD Coin is emerging as one of the best meme coins to buy in December 2024, while also examining the market positions of Turbo and Fartcoin and their proven track records in the meme coin frenzy. Let‚Äôs see if BTFD Coin has what it takes to dominate the meme coin space in 2025. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Powerhouse with Play2Earn and Staking Rewards BTFD Coin has set the bar high with an explosive presale that‚Äôs already raised over $1.5 million in just a matter of days. Currently in Stage 8, BTFD Coin is rapidly gathering momentum, with over 30 billion $BTFD coins sold and more than 3,300 holders already on board. So, what makes BTFD Coin stand out from the crowd? The key to its success lies in its unique approach to meme coin utility. BTFD Coin isn‚Äôt just another pump-and-dump meme token; it‚Äôs a project with serious plans to integrate real-world functionality. One of its most exciting features is the Play2Earn game. This game allows users to engage with the coin in a way that‚Äôs not only fun but also profitable. Players can earn $BTFD coins through gameplay, providing an interactive way for the community to grow and benefit. It‚Äôs an exciting twist on traditional meme coins, which tend to focus primarily on speculation and hype. In addition to the Play2Earn game, BTFD Coin offers staking rewards for its holders. By staking $BTFD coins, investors can earn additional tokens, providing a passive income stream while supporting the coin‚Äôs ecosystem. This is a feature that adds long-term value and makes BTFD Coin more than just a meme‚Äîit turns it into a sustainable investment option. The real-life applications of meme coins like BTFD are becoming more prominent. Community-driven projects like Dogecoin have already shown that meme coins can become valuable assets. Similarly, BTFD Coin‚Äôs Play2Earn game and staking options are setting it up for a future where meme coins are not just for fun‚Äîthey can also deliver real financial returns. If you invested $1,000 in the 8th stage at $0.000076 per coin, you‚Äôd get 13,157,895 $BTFD coins. Now, as the presale progresses, analysts are predicting that BTFD could surge up to $0.25 per coin once launched, which would mean your $1,000 investment could be worth over $3.28 million. That‚Äôs some serious potential for growth! Turbo Coin: Riding the Meme Coin Wave with Consistent Gains Turbo Coin is one of the most successful meme coins in recent years, thanks to its vibrant community and unique approach to marketing. Turbo Coin capitalised on the meme coin frenzy and became a go-to investment for those looking to profit from the meme coin movement. The coin‚Äôs value exploded in 2021, as it capitalised on the viral meme trend while also building a solid base of supporters who rallied behind the project. Turbo Coin is known for its active community and its ability to generate excitement around each of its releases. Its developers frequently launch new initiatives and marketing campaigns that keep the community engaged and invested.

By fostering a loyal community and offering exciting use cases, Turbo Coin has stayed relevant in the meme coin space, even as other coins have risen and fallen. For investors looking to get involved with one of the best meme coins to buy in December 2024, Turbo Coin remains a solid option. While it may not have the explosive potential of a fresh project like BTFD Coin, Turbo Coin has proven itself as a reliable meme coin with strong community backing and steady market growth. Fartcoin: The Meme Coin That‚Äôs Always on the Pulse of Internet Culture If you‚Äôre looking for a meme coin that embodies internet culture, Fartcoin is a prime example. Known for its humourous and often irreverent branding, Fartcoin has captured the attention of meme lovers and crypto enthusiasts alike. While its name alone makes it stand out, Fartcoin has established itself as more than just a joke‚Äîit‚Äôs a meme coin with staying power. Fartcoin has been around for a few years now, and its market position reflects the coin‚Äôs ability to maintain a loyal and engaged community. By capitalising on internet memes and popular culture, Fartcoin has remained a relevant project in the ever-evolving meme coin ecosystem. It‚Äôs a coin that‚Äôs seen steady growth, largely due to its clever use of social media and meme culture. In many ways, Fartcoin serves as the ultimate example of how meme coins can tap into the zeitgeist of internet culture and turn it into a profitable investment opportunity. Whether it‚Äôs through meme-based events or collaborations with influencers, Fartcoin continues to push the boundaries of what a meme coin can be. For investors, Fartcoin represents a stable meme coin with a long history of engagement. While its market cap may not be as large as some of the more well-established coins, it has a proven track record and a growing user base. For those looking for an established meme coin with a unique flavour, Fartcoin is one of the best meme coins to buy in December 2024. Conclusion: The Future of Meme Coins and Why BTFD Coin Leads the Pack As we head into 2025, meme coins remain a powerful force in the cryptocurrency world. BTFD Coin‚Äôs explosive presale, combined with its Play2Earn game and staking rewards, has positioned it as a true contender in the meme coin space. With analysts predicting a surge in price after the presale, BTFD Coin offers some of the most exciting growth potential for investors in 2025. Turbo Coin and Fartcoin have already proven themselves as reliable meme coin projects, but BTFD Coin‚Äôs fresh approach and real-world utility make it the best meme coin to buy in December 2024 for long-term investors.

With this, the token has achieved a market capitalisation of over $11 billion, surpassing the giants like Litecoin. However, the trading volume does not appear to have completely shifted in favour of bulls and if this happens, the PEPE price rally is expected to kick off and reach the levels above $0.00004 very soon. The third largest memecoin as per the market capitalisation, PEPE, has just marked a milestone. By breaking above the bull flag, the token swelled high and marked a new ATH, which has attracted some bearish attention. The price has dropped marginally but the ongoing correction is expected to offer a strong bullish momentum as it did in May 2024, which propelled the price by over 70% to mark the highs above $0.000017. Now that the token is manifesting a similar price action, the PEPE price rally is expected to rise above $0.00004, probably in the first few days of 2025. The PEPE price rally appears to be following a pattern since the beginning of the year, with new highs being achieved at regular intervals.The current trade setup resembles the rally that occurred in mid-Q2. The price surged above the resistance zone, and after a brief retracement, it exceeded 70%. The Ichimoku cloud supports the retracement narrative, as the base and conversion lines are approaching a bearish crossover. However, the RSI sticks to the upper threshold, reviving the hope for a bullish continuation. Therefore, the current trade until the weekend could be extremely important, which may shed light on the next price action. If the price experiences a retracement, it could rise by 75%, setting a new ATH above $0.00004. Otherwise, a bullish continuation could exhaust buyers, causing the token to behave sluggishly for a while before marching towards the upper target. The PEPE price rally has taken off and is just an inch away from becoming the second largest memecoin, surpassing Shiba Inu. With over $7.5 billion trading volume compared to $2.5 billion of SHIB, the flipping seems to be inevitable, as it‚Äôs just a matter of time. The short-term and long-term charts suggest the Pepe price may soon enter a pre-Christmas rally, which could help the price to trade within a discovery phase for a long time ahead.",POSITIVE,SHIB | PEPE,ALTCOIN | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING | PEPE,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/pepe-primed-for-a-50-upswing-while-memecoin-mania-fades-can-pepe-surpass-shib-in-the-coming-days/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Rollblock Pundits Hoping To Go More As Crypto Presale Enters Stage 9,"The DeFi race has just begun, and crypto enthusiasts are rushing to fill up their bags with DOGE, SOL, and Rollblock‚Äôs RBLK . The numbers don‚Äôt lie; Dogecoin‚Äôs volume flipped Solana‚Äôs, with DOGE‚Äôs trading volume increasing to $7 billion at the time of writing. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean that Solana is left behind. If anything, Solana‚Äôs ecosystem has registered a 400% uptick in transactional volume on its DeFi Phantom wallet. That is a clear signal of a rising bullish sentiment towards DeFi and meme coins. Even Rollblock‚Äôs crypto presale has registered an uptick of interest, with its RBLK token surging 310% since the launch of the presale. Early investors have so far raised nearly $7 million, and analysts anticipate an uptick once RBLK launches on the exchange. Dogecoin‚Äôs trading volume surpasses Solana‚Äôs Trading volume on any cryptocurrency is an indication of how many traders and investors are paying attention to a particular coin. Just recently, DOGE‚Äôs trading volume surpassed Solana‚Äôs $5 billion and now sits around $7 billion. While trading volume is always volatile, it‚Äôs always used by traders as an early indicator of a bull run or massive sell-off. For DOGE‚Äôs case, this uptick in trading volume shows increased interest in DOGE now that Bitcoin has breached $100,000. Bullish traders on DOGE believe that the leading dog-themed meme coin could soon hit $1. That would be a near 2x rally from its current price. Solana‚Äôs SOL tipped to surge as Phantom volume increases While DOGE is getting ready to soar, Solana‚Äôs SOL is next in line. Recent reports show that Solana‚Äôs most popular DeFi wallet ‚Äì Phantom‚Äì has registered a 400% uptick in transactional volume. Solana‚Äôs meme coin mania has been the overarching theme of crypto in 2024, and onlookers anticipate further upticks, as seen by recently launched meme coins that are now live on major crypto exchanges like Binance. Hovering around $235, SOL is expected to reach $275 on its way to new ATHs. Rollblock‚Äôs crypto presale raises over $6.9 million Rollblock is a GambleFi protocol on track to disrupt the global online gambling market, whose value is set to peak at $744 billion by 2028. Rollblock‚Äôs ongoing crypto presale has already raised nearly $7 million, and its native RBLK token has surged over 310%, a move that has seen analysts anticipate an additional 800% uptick on launch. Rolblock‚Äôs crypto presale is on track to establish the world‚Äôs first leading GambleFi protocol built on Ethereum‚Äôs blockchain. Rollblock is designed for both novice and expert casino players. Every game is similar to what you would find in a regular casino. The world of online gambling is only growing bigger, and Rollblock is on track to lead the charge with a transparent and accountable platform. To begin with, Rollblock is community-centric, given that a stake in the casino‚Äôs profits is distributed among RBLK holders and casino players through bonuses and rewards. There is also a 30% APY staking program. Plus, the games are provably fair, and every transaction is recorded on the blockchain. This gives players peace of mind, and with high payouts, casino lovers can have a good time while earning passively. So far, only 60% of Rollblock‚Äôs RBLK tokens are up for grabs.

He was referring to plans by the incoming Trump administration to hold some BTC in a strategic reserve fund. ‚ÄúBitcoin has become a national security threat,‚Äù wrote Schiff in a post on X Sunday. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one thing when private citizens voluntarily waste their own money buying Bitcoin,‚Äù Schiff said. ‚ÄúBut it crosses the line when they bribe government officials to squander the public‚Äôs money buying it. Bitcoin is now public enemy number one.‚Äù Schiff Shades Bitcoin Over National Security The global hedge fund strategist and one-time U.S. Senate candidate from Connecticut was most likely referring to the strategic asset reserve for cryptocurrencies proposed by Donald Trump and key allies in his wing of the Republican Party. While speaking at the Bitcoin Conference this July and campaigning for reelection to the White House in November, the president-elect said, ‚ÄúIf I am elected, it will be the policy of my administration, the United States of America, to keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.‚Äù ‚ÄúFor too long our government has violated the cardinal rule that every bitcoiner knows by heart,‚Äù Trump told conference gatherers in Nashville, Tennessee. ‚ÄúNever sell your bitcoin.‚Äù Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis has taken it a step further. She has proposed that the US government should acquire more Bitcoin to add to a strategic BTC reserve fund. But Peter Schiff opines that Bitcoin is America‚Äôs worst enemy. We can create a brighter future for generations of Americans by diversifying into #Bitcoin and being the first developed nation to create a strategic reserve.

Bitcoin has a number of features that make it useful and desirable, but as far as the public sector goes, it provides a shelter for income earners and wealth holders to protect their wealth from government redistribution, and even grow it. That helps guard national security against these insidious freeloaders who Schiff derides for fleecing Americans‚Äô prosperity from within by misusing government programs.

37413559,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51698,1733726643,XRP Round Two Rally Incoming? Top Trader Sees Another Major Pump,"XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has captured significant attention in the crypto market. With its recent price performance, XRP has become a focal point for long-time supporters and skeptics who questioned its value and sustainability. XRP, a veteran of the cryptocurrency space, recently experienced an unprecedented surge in its valuation. The token now trades at approximately $2.57, just 49.4% shy of its record high from January 2018. This marks one of the most remarkable periods in the asset‚Äôs history. To put the scale of its growth into perspective, XRP‚Äôs price was five times lower just a month ago, with a market capitalization hovering around $30 billion. Today, the cryptocurrency boasts a market cap of $147 billion, placing it behind only Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Is a Second Wave on the Horizon? While XRP‚Äôs recent performance is notable, some analysts believe its upward trajectory may not yet be over. In a recent post on X, a well-known cryptocurrency trader named ‚ÄúDonAlt‚Äù speculated that XRP might be gearing up for another rally. DonAlt described the potential for further growth as ‚Äúabsurd,‚Äù noting that the cryptocurrency has already gained over 470% in recent weeks. Despite this, the trader suggested that the token‚Äôs market activity could indicate preparations for another major price increase. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What Could Be Next for XRP? If DonAlt‚Äôs prediction proves accurate, the next phase of XRP‚Äôs growth could significantly elevate its market standing. The ongoing speculation has sparked discussions about whether XRP might eventually surpass Ethereum‚Äôs market capitalization. Some even question if it could challenge Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance in the cryptocurrency hierarchy. Such bold projections underscore the heightened interest in XRP‚Äôs price movement and the broader implications for the cryptocurrency market. However, these predictions remain speculative, and potential investors are urged to exercise caution. XRP‚Äôs Resilience in a Competitive Market XRP‚Äôs recent success can be attributed to several factors, including heightened investor interest and market momentum. However, its ability to sustain this growth will depend on external and internal factors, such as regulatory developments and overall market conditions. Despite its critics, XRP demonstrates resilience, maintaining its position as a top-tier cryptocurrency. Whether it will capitalize on its current momentum or face challenges in sustaining its value remains to be seen.

37413370,https://coinpedia.org/?p=390812,1733726580,4 Cheaper and Better Tokens to Consider Over Ripple (XRP),"The post 4 Cheaper and Better Tokens to Consider Over Ripple (XRP) appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple has been a dominant cryptocurrency for a long time. As the lion‚Äôs share, we have seen many cheap token launches that give good hope. Some of them include Rexas Finance (RXS), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Kaspa (KAS), and Hedera (HBAR). Besides being cheap, these tokens have some specific value requirements, making them a great opportunity for investors who want to earn something without spending a fortune. Rexas Finance (RXS): Transforming Asset-Backed Investment Rexas Finance is restructuring how real-world assets are tokenized, making it possible for investors to buy shares of an investment, be it property, art, or other commodities. The ERC-20 token, such as this one, ensures cross-border access to highly valuable assets using blockchain. Thus, all investors can transact in a safe and transparent environment. Currently, RXS is valued at $0.125 while in stage 9 of its presale. Throughout all the presale stages, the token has gathered $21 million in funds, and over 290 million tokens have been sold, indicating demand and interest from the crypto space. While projections suggest the token will be available on Tier-1 exchanges in 2025 at $0.20, the presale offers early investors a chance to invest in the coin before anyone else in the market. Rexas Finance‚Äôs primary goals are sustainability and rewarding the community, which are well elaborated in its tokenomics. Of the entire supply of one billion tokens, 42.5% is reserved for the presale event, 22.5% for staking pools, and 15% for liquidity. The rest goes toward marketing, treasury, and giveaways, allowing a good proportion to encourage development and investment in the platform. The project has gained credibility through listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, appearing at the fingertips of global investors. A CertiK audit offers security and transparency, which gives users trust in the platform. Additionally, to further stimulate its community, Rexas Finance is conducting a $1 million giveaway, with 20 winners awarded $50,000 worth of RXS tokens each. To buy tokens, you must create a MetaMask wallet or Trust Wallet, acquire either ETH or USDT, and follow the Rexas Finance site requirements. This makes it easy for both new and experienced investors to participate in the presale. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Still a Meme Coin but with More Potential Price: 0.00003094 Market Cap: 18.21 billion Now, SHIB has established its presence as a utility cryptocurrency. In the wake of launching the Layer-2 scaling solution Shibarium, SHIB is now expanding into DEXs, NFTs, and staking. This shift has created a new foundation for its subsequent adoption and usage, positioning it as a serious user in the market. Because of the low price of Shiba Inu and consistent community support, it is easily one of the most sought-after assets for investors looking for something to grow significantly in value. Predictions suggest that SHIB will rise significantly in value as its ecosystem expands. Kaspa (KAS): A High-Performance Blockchain Solution Price: $0.1653 Market Cap: $4.18 billion Kaspa is a Layer-1 blockchain solution with unique characteristics such as high throughput and a highly energy-efficient consensus. Built based on GhostDAG, it provides instant finality of transactions and offers unprecedented scale for DeFi and dApps as blockchain-based tools. It is no surprise that Kaspa has made a place for itself among high-performance blockchain solutions due to the increasing developer community and wide adoption. With easy entry for investing customers, the current price of KAS seems nominal, especially as Kaspa continues to expand its ecosystem and innovative technology. Hedera (HBAR): The Enterprise-Grade Blockchain Price: $0.1964 Market Cap: $7.50 billion Hedera Hashgraph is a key motivation behind founding one of the speediest, secure, and scalable enterprise-centric blockchain networks. Compliance with organizations and reputable firms such as IBM and Google showcases HBAR‚Äôs enterprise appeal. Adopting the underlying ecosystem and enterprises using HBAR have contributed to its increasing demand. It is highly potent in the market, which is increasingly focused on decentralized apps and tokenization. Conclusion Though Ripple (XRP) remains one of the major coins in the crypto market, Rexas Finance, Shiba Inu, Kaspa, and Hedera provide opportunities as cheap alternatives. Rexas Finance , with its strong token presale, emphasis on real-world asset tokenization, and approved security by CertiK, stands out as particularly appealing. These tokens offer a mix of innovation, utility, and growth for people looking to diversify their investments. Rexas Finance invites you to participate in the presale and hedge against the future of decentralized finance today.

The overall trading volume in the altcoin industry has significantly surged in the past few weeks, as whale investors turned their attention from Bitcoin (BTC) to large-cap altcoins led by Ripple Labs XRP, Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE), among others. However, some crypto experts have cautioned traders to only trade altcoins with solid fundamentals in the upcoming altseason to avoid getting rugged or holding non-performing coins. Furthermore, the high existence of crypto projects has diluted the entire industry compared to the 2021 and 2017 bull market cycles. Key Altcoin Unlocks to Consider this Week According to market data from tokenomist , several altcoin projects will cliff-unlock a total of $750.63 million in the next seven days. In this category, Cheelee (CHEEL), a BNB Chain-based SocialFi that has a fully diluted valuation of about $9.5 billion, will cliff-unlock about 20.8 million tokens, worth over $234 million on December 13, 2024. The other major cliff-unlock for this week is from the Aptos (APT) network involving 2.11 percent of the total supply, or about 11.3 million tokens worth around $158 million, on December 11. The Connex (CONX) project will also cliff-unlock 4.3 million tokens, worth about $141 million, which represents 376 percent of the circulating supply on December 15. Other notable cliff-unlocks this week include Starknet (STRK) with $47 million, Cardano (ADA) with $43 million, Sei (SEI) with $36 million and Polyhedra network (ZKJ) with $30 million. As for the total linear release today, Worldcoin (WLD) has the highest with $19.36 million per day, followed by Solana (SOL) with $17.39 million per day. Market Impact Crypto projects with the highest dilution in the next few days will likely face more bearish sentiments. Furthermore, the emergence of FOMO crypto traders is focused on performing altcoins with robust fundamentals including deflationary aspects. Consequently, it is prudent for crypto traders to keep a watch on the top altcoins with the highest in clocks in the coming days.",POSITIVE,ADA | SOL,ADA | ALTCOIN | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-bull-run-how-this-weeks-750m-token-unlocks-affect-altcoin-season/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Their innovative features and rising adoption rates are solidifying their status as essential assets for investors aiming to capitalize on bullish crypto trends. From the impressive AVAX price trajectory to Rollblock‚Äôs transformative approach, these projects are reshaping the market landscape. Here‚Äôs why they‚Äôre setting the pace. Rollblock: The future of utility and profitability While Avalanche and Sui capture headlines, Rollblock is quietly redefining what it means to be a bullish crypto . As the pioneer of the GambleFi ecosystem, Rollblock combines utility with profitability, offering token holders weekly distributions from casino profits. This real-world application sets Rollblock apart from projects reliant solely on speculative value. Rollblock‚Äôs deflationary tokenomics ensure sustained value by burning 60% of repurchased tokens and redistributing 40% to stakers. With over $6.9 million raised during its ongoing presale, Rollblock is attracting smart investors seeking consistent returns in a volatile market. As Rollblock grows, its ecosystem promises to disrupt traditional gaming and DeFi industries. This makes it not only an exciting investment but also a transformative force in the broader crypto landscape. Avalanche (AVAX): A rising star in the bullish crypto market Avalanche gains traction thanks to its strategic developments and impressive AVAX price performance. Currently trading at $52 AVAX has surged by over 7% in the past 24 hours, fueled by growing investor confidence and discussions with the incoming Trump administration. This collaboration could open doors to significant policy support, amplifying AVAX ‚Äôs market position. Technically, AVAX is poised for further growth. With strong support levels at $44.27 and $42.25, analysts suggest that breaking the $55 resistance could catapult the AVAX price toward $60, with $100 as a long-term target. November‚Äôs transaction volume peaked at $566 million, and a 5.52% decline in dormant wallets signals increased activity and utility. Sui (SUI): The Solana killer driving DeFi adoption Sui quickly climbed the ranks to become one of the big players in the blockchain space. Dubbed the ‚ÄúSolana killer,‚Äù the price of SUI skyrocketed by 550% in just four months, now trading around $3.45. This meteoric rise reflects growing confidence in its ecosystem, which integrates Bitcoin staking and DeFi services. Sui ‚Äôs recent partnership with Babylon Labs and Lombard Protocol introduces Bitcoin staking to its DeFi ecosystem, allowing users to earn LBTC, a liquid staking token pegged to BTC prices. This innovation has attracted $325 million in bridged assets from Ethereum over 30 days, demonstrating its appeal among both retail and institutional investors. Why these cryptos define 2025‚Äôs bullish momentum What unites AVAX , SUI , and Rollblock is their ability to adapt and innovate within the rapidly evolving crypto market. From Avalanche ‚Äôs strategic partnerships to Sui ‚Äôs focus on DeFi integration and Rollblock‚Äôs real-world utility, these projects exemplify the future of blockchain technology. AVAX continues to impress with its scalable infrastructure and strategic positioning in the global market. SUI is driving DeFi adoption with groundbreaking features like Bitcoin staking and user-friendly interfaces. Rollblock redefines profitability by combining deflationary economics with tangible rewards. As 2025 unfolds, these cryptos are more than just bullish picks; they are shaping the next phase of blockchain innovation. Whether you‚Äôre an investor or an enthusiast, AVAX , SUI , and Rollblock are must-haves for anyone looking to capitalize on the market‚Äôs bullish momentum.

37412681,https://coinpaper.com/6419/think-tank-pushes-amazon-to-adopt-bitcoin-treasury-strategy,1733725144,Think Tank Pushes Amazon to Adopt Bitcoin Treasury Strategy,"The proposal will be discussed at its April 2025 shareholder meeting. Meanwhile, El Salvador‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings generated impressive unrealized gains, though the IMF is still very critical about the nation‚Äôs Bitcoin policies. In the U.S., President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs proposal for a national Bitcoin reserve attracted some skepticism from financial experts but is supported by his pro-crypto appointments, including David Sacks and Scott Bessent. Amazon Urged to Consider Bitcoin The National Center for Public Policy Research, which is a Washington, DC-based think tank advocating for free markets, urged Amazon to consider adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy. This proposal is set to be discussed at the company‚Äôs April 2025 shareholder meeting. In its letter to Amazon, the think tank criticized the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as a flawed measure of inflation, and suggested the true inflation rate might be double the reported figure of 4.95%. They argued that this inflation severely erodes Amazon's $88 billion in cash and short-term equivalents and proposed Bitcoin as a hedge against this risk. The letter also pointed out that as of Dec. 6, 2024, Bitcoin's price rose by 131% over the past year, vastly outperforming corporate bonds. Over a five-year period, Bitcoin achieved a 1,246% increase, which was far more than the returns on corporate bonds. To safeguard shareholder value, the think tank recommended Amazon allocate at least 5% of its assets to Bitcoin. It even referred to MicroStrategy‚Äôs success as a case study. MicroStrategy, which is led by Michael Saylor, has been a pioneer in adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy, and it also inspired other organizations to follow suit. The company‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings are now valued at more than $40 billion, yielding a profit of about $17 billion. MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings (Source: MSTR Tracker ) Mining company MARA also embraced this strategy, and recently completed a $1 billion convertible note offering at 0% interest in November of 2024. The company used the proceeds to buy 6,474 Bitcoin. Artificial Intelligence firm Genius Group announced its Bitcoin treasury strategy in the same month, and started with a purchase of 110 Bitcoin at an average price of $90,932 per coin. El Salvador's BTC Bet Pays Off It is not just companies enjoying the fruits of Bitcoin‚Äôs labour. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele also celebrated the country's unrealized gains from its Bitcoin investments after the crypto recently surpassed $100,000 for the first time. On Dec. 5, Bitcoin reached this historic milestone, which caused widespread excitement in the crypto community. By responding to a request from a crypto-focused account on social media, Bukele shared some details about El Salvador‚Äôs Bitcoin portfolio, and revealed that the country spent close to $270 million on Bitcoin since its adoption. Itsh unrealized gains now exceed $333 million. El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender on Sept. 7 of 2021, after the implementation of its Bitcoin Law. The government made its first purchase of 200 Bitcoin on the eve of the law‚Äôs enactment and has since continued to buy Bitcoin. In November of 2022, Bukele announced a dollar-cost averaging strategy, and committed to buy one Bitcoin daily. According to the Nayib Tracker, the country now holds 6,180 Bitcoin, which was bought at an average price of $44,739.88. The adoption of Bitcoin brought economic benefits beyond just investment gains. The country also reported increased tourism as a result of its pro-Bitcoin policies. However, these developments have not swayed the International Monetary Fund, which has consistently urged El Salvador to reconsider its Bitcoin strategy. In January of 2022, the IMF recommended stopping the recognition of Bitcoin as legal tender due to financial stability risks despite acknowledging the potential for increased financial inclusion. More recently, in October 2024, the IMF reiterated its call to scale back Bitcoin policies, and advised the government to narrow the scope of the Bitcoin Law and limit public sector exposure to the cryptocurrency. While critics are still skeptical, El Salvador's Bitcoin strategy continues to attract attention for its successes. Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin Vision Draws Skepticism On the other hand, former U.S. financial officials are voicing their concerns over President-elect Donald Trump's proposal to establish a national Bitcoin reserve. In a Bloomberg op-ed on Dec. 6, former New York Federal Reserve Bank President Bill Dudley shared his skepticism about the benefits of the U.S. government holding cryptocurrency, even after Bitcoin surpassed $100,000. Dudley argued that Bitcoin does not share the same qualities of traditional money, due to issues like wallet access and transaction inefficiency. He speculated that the proposal might be aimed at driving Bitcoin prices higher rather than actually creating value for the government. He also warned people about the potential fiscal risks like increased debt service costs or inflation. Dudley suggested that Trump should instead focus on regulatory measures to protect consumers and ensure stability in the crypto industry. He recommended legislation to define whether tokens are currencies or securities, ensure stablecoins are fully backed, and prevent their misuse for criminal activities. The Bitcoin proposal attracted some criticism from other well known people in the industry as well, including former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. He even went so far as to call the plan ‚Äùcrazy‚Äù and suggested it was a move to keep special interest groups happy. Despite these criticisms, Trump maintained his stance on crypto after he pledged during the Bitcoin 2024 conference to stop the sale of BTC seized from illicit activities. His ally, Senator Cynthia Lummis, also announced plans to propose legislation for the U.S. government to purchase and hold 1 million Bitcoin for two decades. After his election victory, Trump started creating a more pro-crypto administration by nominating former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins to replace Gary Gensler as head of the SEC. It is still unclear just how these appointments will influence the proposed Bitcoin reserve. David Sacks Joins Trump Team President-elect Donald Trump also appointed David Sacks, a technologist and former PayPal executive, as his top advisor on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. Sacks is a strong supporter of Bitcoin and digital assets, and praised Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a tool for separating money from state control. In a conversation with Anthony Pompliano, Sacks compared Bitcoin‚Äôs potential to the historical separation of church and state, and envisioned a future where money and government might also operate independently. The crypto community widely celebrated Sacks‚Äô appointment, and considers it as a positive step toward clearer regulatory frameworks for digital assets. Sacks‚Äô pro-crypto stance seems to align with Trump‚Äôs broader signals of support for cryptocurrency during his campaign. Sacks is a major backer of Solana and crypto-focused investment firm Multicoin Capital. Despite market challenges, including the collapse of FTX in 2022, Sacks still maintained his confidence in Solana, and previously predicted it could surpass Ethereum in market capitalization and utility. Sacks joins an administration that is poised to embrace cryptocurrency after Trump‚Äôs nomination of Scott Bessent, a pro-crypto hedge fund manager, as Treasury Secretary. Bessent described the crypto economy as a permanent fixture in the financial world and a representation of economic freedom.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6419/think-tank-pushes-amazon-to-adopt-bitcoin-treasury-strategy,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png
37412598,https://coinpedia.org/?p=390791,1733725038,"1Fuel Rockets Ahead With Heavy Investments From Solana and Tron Whales, Poised for 50x Growth","The post 1Fuel Rockets Ahead With Heavy Investments From Solana and Tron Whales, Poised for 50x Growth appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As Solana and Tron continue to break records this season, crypto investors actively search for which new coin on the market holds the most potential for a huge price surge. Lately, one project‚Äôs presale has been making big waves as blockchain investment experts forecast an expected 50x ROI in the coming months. Keep reading to get in early on 50x forecast as 1Fuel ‚Äôs token presale gains increasing appeal across the cryptocurrency playfield. Solana Passes Moving Average: Set to Hit $500 Solana (SOL) is keeping its bulls on their toes as it just broke through a key resistance trendline and surged above the $240 mark. SOL just passed its 100-day moving average and technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) now point to a strong upward trend in the market. Grayscale Investment‚Äôs recent filing for a Solana ETF with the SEC has triggered most of the excitement around the price surge. If this ETF is granted, it could boost Solana‚Äôs institutional appeal, and the coin could level up to join the list of top cryptocurrencies. SOL‚Äôs price shot up by 5% almost immediately the filing was announced, and now optimistic blockchain investment experts are forecasting that it could even reach the $500 price mark. Currently valued at $243 and reaching the $500 mark means Solana would deliver an impressive 100% ROI from its current price. Yet, even this notable ROI pales compared to the returns anticipated for 1Fuel (OFT) if it hits its target price of $0.5. Tron Reaches New Heights as TVL Hits $36.2 Billion Solana is not the only beneficiary of Grayscale‚Äôs recent moves. On December 4, the total value locked (TVL) on Tron hit $36.2 billion, and Tron‚Äôs TRX token recently reached a record-breaking price of $0.44. Although it then corrected to $0.33, it still posted impressive weekly gains of 66% and reclaimed its position as the 10th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The recent rally has been speculatively fueled by TRX‚Äôs potential inclusion in Grayscale‚Äôs portfolio. Grayscale has listed TRX among 35 tokens under evaluation and quarterly updates are expected. This prospect has raised the prospects for increased institutional interest in Tron. Adding to the momentum is Tron founder Justin Sun, whose high-profile moves have drawn attention to the network. Sun recently made a blockchain investment of $30 million in WLFI tokens tied to Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄòWorld Liberty Financial‚Äô initiative and accepted an advisory role with the project. His involvement has also extended to the conceptual artwork ‚ÄúComedian‚Äù, driving community engagement and indirectly boosting interest in related tokens like BAN. 1Fuel Token Presale Ignites Investor Interest with Explosive Potential Although it seems like Solana and Tron are setting unstoppable trends in the market at the moment, their investors have picked up on 1Fuel as the top new project for 2025 . Currently trading at just $0.01, 1Fuel‚Äôs token presale has attracted significant attention, including from blockchain investment experts, due to its explosive growth potential. Should it climb to $0.5, investors could see an extraordinary 500% return that would far eclipse the impressive gains predicted for Solana. Participants in stage 1 of the presale receive a 20% bonus on all purchases which is a great entry point for those looking to secure a stake before the platform‚Äôs public launch. With 500 million tokens (half of the total supply) allocated for the presale, 1Fuel is not only raising capital but also empowering early adopters to shape its future trajectory. One of 1Fuel‚Äôs best features is that it allows seamless cross-chain transactions which simplifies token swaps by removing the unnecessary fees and multiple wallets. The project has allocated 40 million tokens as staking rewards, encouraging holders to lock up their tokens and actively participate in the network. Additionally, 110 million tokens are reserved for liquidity providers, ensuring ample liquidity for smooth trading. Active traders are also rewarded, with 40 million tokens designated to incentivize high-volume transactions and market activity. Conclusion Solana and Tron may be trending upward in the crypto market, but investors have 1Fuel‚Äôs token presale marked out as a chance to make huge returns. By focusing on accessibility, security, and ecosystem growth, 1Fuel positions itself as a gateway to innovative blockchain solutions and sustainable growth for its community. If you‚Äôre excited by the prospect of a fast-growing innovative project with attractive incentives, join the token presale now.

37419813,https://cryptonews.com/?p=318049,1733724478,Radiant Capital Discloses $50M DeFi Hack Linked to North Korea-Aligned Hacker,"Radiant Capital has revealed that the hack that drained $50 million from its decentralized finance (DeFi) platform was orchestrated by a hacker tied to North Korea. According to an update on December 6 , cybersecurity firm Mandiant concluded with ‚Äúhigh confidence‚Äù that the attack can be attributed to a threat actor linked to the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea (DPRK). The attack began on September 11 when a Radiant developer received a Telegram message purportedly from a trusted former contractor. Malware Hidden in Message Caused the Hack The message included a zip file seeking feedback on a new project. Radiant stated that the message is now believed to have originated from a DPRK-affiliated hacker impersonating the contractor. When the file was shared among developers, it unleashed malware that led to the subsequent security breach. On October 16, the breach escalated as the hackers gained control over several private keys and smart contracts, prompting Radiant to halt its lending markets. The platform noted that the zip file did not raise immediate concerns as reviewing documents in PDF format is common in professional environments. Furthermore, the file‚Äôs associated domain was crafted to mimic the contractor‚Äôs legitimate website, adding to the deception. The malware compromised multiple developer devices, enabling the attackers to manipulate transaction data. Radiant explained that front-end interfaces displayed benign information while malicious transactions were processed in the background. Radiant Capital Incident Update A detailed update on the October 16 incident is now available, with Mandiant‚Äôs ongoing investigation attributing the attack with high confidence to a Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea (DPRK)-linked threat actor. The report sheds light‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Radiant Capital (@RDNTCapital) December 7, 2024 The traditional safeguards employed by the platform, such as simulations in Tenderly and payload verification, failed to detect the intrusion. ‚ÄúTraditional checks and simulations showed no obvious discrepancies, making the threat virtually invisible during normal review stages,‚Äù it added. ‚ÄúThis deception was carried out so seamlessly that even with Radiant‚Äôs standard best practices, such as simulating transactions in Tenderly, verifying payload data, and following industry-standard SOPs at every step, the attackers were able to compromise multiple developer devices.‚Äù Attackers Believed to be Linked to North Korea The attackers, identified as ‚ÄúUNC4736‚Äù or ‚ÄúCitrine Sleet,‚Äù are believed to be linked to North Korea‚Äôs Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB) and may be part of the notorious Lazarus Group. The group has been implicated in stealing an estimated $3 billion in cryptocurrency between 2017 and 2023. Following the October hack, approximately $52 million of stolen funds were moved by the hackers on October 24. Radiant Capital described the incident as a stark reminder of the evolving threats faced by DeFi platforms and the limitations of existing security measures. This is not the first major attack on Radiant this year. In January, the platform suffered a $4.5 million flash loan exploit, which also forced the suspension of its lending markets. As reported, South Korea has accused North Korea of orchestrating the 2019 hack on cryptocurrency exchange Upbit, which resulted in the theft of 342,000 ETH, then valued at $41.5 million. The stolen funds, now worth over $1 billion, mark one of the largest crypto heists linked to North Korea, the South Korean National Police Agency announced Thursday.

37413557,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51694,1733724255,Here Are XRP Top Holders By December 2024,"XRP has emerged as a standout performer in the ongoing cryptocurrency market rally, overcoming a prolonged consolidation that had previously cast doubts on its long-term viability. Recent price movements have bolstered confidence in the asset, reflecting a strong distribution network spanning institutional custodians, major exchanges, and individual investors. As of December 2024, XRP is trading at $2.59, marking a 3.03% increase over the past 24 hours and an impressive 20.85% gain over the past week. With its maximum supply capped at 100 billion tokens, approximately 57 billion XRP is currently in circulation. Ripple, the major distributor of XRP, continues to play a significant role in managing the asset‚Äôs supply through its escrow accounts , which hold 38.04 billion XRP. These accounts release tokens gradually to maintain market liquidity and supply control. Major XRP Holders Ripple remains the largest custodian of XRP tokens. Data from the XRP Scan on December 7 reveals that Ripple‚Äôs escrow accounts collectively hold 5 billion XRP. These holdings are distributed across accounts labeled Ripple (11), Ripple (10), and Ripple (28). Among other key holders, major cryptocurrency exchanges feature prominently. Uphold and Binance rank ninth and tenth, with approximately 1.84 billion XRP and 1.83 billion XRP, respectively. Additional significant holders include Bithumb with 1.39 billion XRP, UPbit with 1.22 billion XRP, and Coincheck, which holds 623.4 million XRP. While XRP‚Äôs distribution spans various entities, its concentration in a few major holders has drawn criticism. Some experts argue that such concentration could lead to centralized control, which raises questions about XRP‚Äôs decentralization. Financial analyst Rajat Soni has previously expressed concerns, stating that XRP‚Äôs structure could facilitate price manipulation and labeling it a ‚Äúscam.‚Äù Despite these concerns, Ripple does not control the XRP Ledger. Any changes to the ledger require consensus among its validators, ensuring no single entity can unilaterally alter its structure. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Current Market Performance and Technical Outlook XRP has demonstrated strong bullish momentum supported by favorable technical conditions. According to an analysis shared by cryptocurrency expert Cryptoinsightuk on December 7, XRP could reach $5.26 by December 11. The analyst noted that XRP recently broke through critical resistance levels, specifically the 0.5‚Äì0.618 Fibonacci retracement zones. These levels are often pivotal for price reversals, and XRP‚Äôs ability to surpass them has fueled speculation about its continued upward trajectory. The current technical setup resembles a previous phase during which XRP rapidly surged to the 4.236 Fibonacci extension within three days. If the asset repeats this pattern, it could achieve the ambitious $5.26 target in the short term. However, the analyst cautioned that XRP might enter overbought territory, signaling the potential for a near-term pullback. Factors Supporting XRP‚Äôs Growth Beyond its technical outlook, XRP‚Äôs recent rally is supported by favorable market fundamentals. The broader cryptocurrency market has benefitted from a shift in regulatory sentiment, particularly following the nomination of a pro-crypto candidate to replace outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Additionally, Ripple has gained momentum following positive developments in its ongoing legal battles and increased institutional adoption of blockchain technologies. These factors collectively strengthen XRP‚Äôs position as a leading cryptocurrency despite persistent concerns about its centralized token distribution. With a 366% increase in value over the past month, XRP has proven its resilience and remains one of the most closely watched digital assets heading into 2024. However, its trajectory will depend on continued market support, regulatory clarity, and the asset‚Äôs ability to sustain its technical momentum.

At press time, BNB keeps printing green candles with nearly 40% gains this month. Also, BNB now has more than $111 billion in market cap. HBAR Rides The Altcoin season momentum Hedera Hashgraph has been quietly building a blockchain empire, backed by heavyweights like Google, IBM, and Ubisoft.

The report added that investors also expected a crypto boom under Trump‚Äôs regulations.

The ETFs are worth $113 billion, with IBIT, GBTC, and FBTC having the highest market caps of $55.87 billion, $49.80 billion, and $19.75 billion, respectively.

The recent Bitcoin market cap is $2 trillion. Through these projections, Saylor will keep buying Bitcoin every week and urge more investors and institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin.

Both of the figure‚Äôs vision, Trump and Saylor, was driven by Bitcoin‚Äôs utility and use cases against inflations. This move also inspired other institutions and nations to acquire or keep their Bitcoin.

Trump‚Äôs Tesla (TRUMTESLA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMTESLA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump‚Äôs Tesla can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump‚Äôs Tesla could become the next viral memecoin. Trump‚Äôs Tesla launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump‚Äôs Tesla on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump‚Äôs Tesla by entering its contract address ‚Äì 8T1qq1DxSqWqoR8J9hi3ULGCCoMJdqQBev4WAvJg9awR ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMTESLA.

Pepe and Shiba Inu are still in the green, though memes in general have lost steam as large-cap utility plays gain traction. Gaming is yet to experience significant upward momentum, though some analysts believe a DeFi gaming rally is well overdue. In this lucrative hype-based sector, Rollblock stands out as a particularly profitable venture to look into heading into 2025. Read on to learn more. Whale Activity Bolsters Investor Confidence In Pepe Pepe has solidified its position as the third-largest memecoin, driven by recent listings on Coinbase, Robin Hood, and most recently Binance US. These significant listings have increased Pepe‚Äôs accessibility in the USA, contributing to Pepe‚Äôs 166% rise in a 30-day timeframe. Whales have further boosted confidence in Pepe ahead of the bull run, accumulating 337 million tokens worth over $6 million collectively. A recent trend of moving Pepe tokens off of exchanges has reduced selling pressure and supports Pepe‚Äôs bullish long-term growth prospects. With strong community support and increasing adoption, Pepe is well-positioned to continue its upward trajectory, as some crypto influencers like ‚ÄúMurad‚Äù predict that a meme supercycle is on the precipice. Burns And Increasing Interest From Whales Puts Shiba Inu In Bullish Stead Shiba Inu has regained momentum just in time for the bull run, with notable whale activity signaling renewed confidence amongst large investors. Two transactions in particular have garnered significant attention, one being a major transfer of over 80 billion SHIB from Coinbase and a separate 54 billion SHIB migration from a US government-linked wallet. In addition, Shiba Inu‚Äôs layer-2 blockchain, Shibarium, has seen its total value locked surge past $10 million, an 850% jump since September. Deflationary mechanisms, including a 4500% spike in the token‚Äôs burn rate, are also strengthening Shiba Inu‚Äôs supply dynamics, rendering Shiba Inu as more scarce. With further burns anticipated around Christmas, analysts anticipate Shiba Inu to continue its impressive growth trajectory at a time when memes are more popular than ever. Don‚Äôt Miss Out On Rollblock Before The Gaming Rally Rollblock is reshaping the iGaming industry with its innovative play-to-earn platform, seamlessly integrating decentralized and traditional gaming with lucrative rewards and a strong overall foundation that sets it up perfectly for further growth.

37411764,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51684,1733722226,"Analysts Predict A Bitcoin Correction In December, Investors Buy Lunex Network And Dogecoin Instead","A major Bitcoin (BTC) pullback could be looming as signs of weakness are appearing on the chart. On the other hand, Dogecoin (DOGE) seems ready to fly as it recently broke through crucial resistance, however, bulls must defend this level at any cost if they want to see upward price discovery. Lunex Network is another contender that could experience a massive rally in the upcoming weeks. Thousands of investors have already rushed to the presale, as over $4.6 million has been raised in record time. Bitcoin Enters Cool-Off Phase Just Below $100k All eyes are on Bitcoin (BTC) as it finally reaches the $100k milestone, and then added a few thousand for good measure. Predictably, at the top, selling pressure grew and Bitcoin retraced, briefly tapping the $96k support before rebounding. Today, Bitcoin sells for $99,569, reflecting a 3% gain. A deeper correction could be in store, on Bitcoin‚Äôs 4-hour chart, a bearish divergence has appeared, as the RSI is dipping while the price has been moving above an ascending trendline. A break below this trendline could confirm a short-term bearish scenario for Bitcoin. Trading volume has dipped by 45%, or roughly $65 billion worth of BTC traded across exchanges, this decline goes to show that buyers are taking a step back and redirecting attention to other altcoins that could be primed for new surges, such as Dogecoin and Lunex Network. Dogecoin Reclaims $0.45, What‚Äôs Next? After consolidating around $0.40 for the past few weeks, Dogecoin (DOGE) has soared by 3.8% on the daily timeframe, reaching $0.45. If this resistance is flipped into support, the way would be paved for Dogecoin to surge above $0.50 by the end of the year and possibly, reach the prophesied $1 landmark in early 2025. Analyst and trader Eliz has shared a Dogecoin chart reading, showing that DOGE has been moving into an ascending channel, with consistent rebounds from the trendline. Today, Elon Musk also did his part to elevate the sentiment of Dogecoin holders, as he reposted the same viral meme that he shared in 2021, during the memorable DOGE run. Why Lunex Network Could Be One Of The Best Plays Of 2025 Groundbreaking DeFi exchange Lunex could significantly disrupt the exchange industry with its innovative framework. The platform integrates isolated blockchains and allows for instantaneous swaps between more than 50,000 assets. All transactions will be conducted anonymously, as no KYC or third-party wallet is required. Individuals can just input the ticker they want to swap, insert the address, and hit confirm. It‚Äôs a frictionless and intuitive experience that doesn‚Äôt require jumping through hoops or jeopardizing sensitive data. Moreover, users will have access to an exclusive, non-custodial wallet and a portfolio tracker app with built-in analytic tools for optimal asset management. Users who want to take their experience to the next level can also subscribe to the Lunex Pro service and use refined trading tools and special features such as cashback bonuses and AML wallet checks. Institutional clients aren‚Äôt left behind either, Lunex Network offers a tailored interoperable blockchain bridge acting as a B2B payment gateway. Businesses will be able to receive crypto payments and have them instantly swapped into fiat money at the lowest rate possible.

37411246,https://coinpaper.com/6420/cardano-foundation-x-account-hacked-in-fake-token-scam,1733722223,Cardano Foundation X Account Hacked in Fake Token Scam,"In recent developments highlighting the growing risks in the digital asset space, the Cardano Foundation's X account was compromised in a scam promoting a fake token, while Brooklyn authorities shut down a network of fraudulent NFT marketplaces targeting artists. These incidents, which resulted in significant financial losses for victims, bring attention to the importance of vigilance as bad actors exploit the growth and innovation within the crypto and NFT markets. Cardano Foundation‚Äôs X Account Hacked: Fraudulent Token Scheme Exploits Users The Cardano Foundation faced a significant cybersecurity incident on Dec. 8, 2024, when its official X account was compromised by a threat actor. The hacker used the platform to promote a fraudulent token, ‚ÄùADAsol,‚Äù falsely claiming it was the successor to Cardano's native ADA token. Additionally, the attacker asserted that Cardano would cease support for ADA due to an alleged lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The fake ADAsol token garnered approximately $500,000 in trading volume before crashing by 99%. Many users fell victim to the scam in the brief window before the account was secured and the fraudulent posts removed. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson confirmed the hack on social media, urging the community to remain vigilant. The compromised account no longer hosts the scam-related content, but the incident serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with malicious activities in the crypto space. The Cardano Foundation emphasized that no other parts of its ecosystem were affected by the breach. However, it cautioned users against interacting with links shared via its X account until further notice. The Cardano Foundation's hack is part of a broader trend of cybersecurity breaches targeting prominent crypto and public figures' X accounts. These incidents often result in significant financial losses and erode trust within the community. In December 2023, Compound Finance‚Äôs X account fell prey to hackers, who posted phishing links disguised as legitimate protocol content. These links redirected users to a site mimicking Compound's official website, promoting fraudulent COMP tokens. Unsuspecting users who interacted with these links found their crypto assets drained. October 2024 saw multiple high-profile X account hacks. Symbiotic, a restaking protocol, was targeted by a phishing scheme disguised as an airdrop checklist. Similarly, Eigenlayer, another restaking protocol, had its X account used to promote a fake airdrop campaign. Both incidents resulted in losses for users who were tricked into connecting their wallets to malicious sites. On Oct. 29, 2024, the founder of Truth Terminal AI reported their X account had been hijacked to promote a fraudulent meme coin. In November 2024, the X account of rapper Wiz Khalifa was also compromised, with the threat actor pushing a fake celebrity meme coin named ‚ÄùWIZ.‚Äù This incident leveraged Khalifa‚Äôs fame to exploit unsuspecting fans. Community Vigilance: The First Line of Defense The rise of social media account hacks targeting crypto entities stresses the need for increased vigilance. The Cardano Foundation's swift acknowledgment of the incident and efforts to secure its compromised account are commendable. However, such incidents show the necessity for enhanced security measures and community awareness. Users should adopt the following best practices to avoid falling victim to similar schemes: Verify Sources: Always confirm the authenticity of announcements by cross-referencing them with official websites or verified channels. Avoid Suspicious Links: Refrain from clicking on links in social media posts, even if they appear legitimate. Enable 2FA: Secure your own accounts with two-factor authentication (2FA) to reduce the risk of being hacked. Use Wallet Security Features: Leverage hardware wallets or wallet apps with robust phishing detection. While the crypto industry must address vulnerabilities within its community, social media platforms also bear responsibility. These platforms need to prioritize security for high-profile accounts, including enhanced monitoring and rapid response mechanisms for compromised accounts. The Cardano Foundation hack serves as another cautionary tale in the crypto space, reminding users of the importance of vigilance and proactive measures to protect their assets. As the Foundation works to secure its ecosystem and restore trust, the broader crypto community must remain alert to the persistent threat of social media scams. With better security practices and community collaboration, the industry can mitigate the risks posed by malicious actors. Brooklyn DA Shuts Down 40 Fake NFT Marketplaces After Artist Loses $135,000 in Scam The Brooklyn District Attorney‚Äôs Office has dismantled a network of 40 fraudulent non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace websites that targeted unsuspecting artists, including an 85-year-old victim who was scammed out of $135,000. The operation, announced on Dec. 6, sheds some light on the growing sophistication of digital art scams and the vulnerability of artists navigating the NFT space. The victim, an elderly artist, was contacted on LinkedIn by a scammer posing as an art dealer. Convincing the artist to mint his work on a counterfeit NFT marketplace designed to mimic the popular platform OpenSea, the scammer lured him with promises of lucrative profits. The victim was later informed that his artwork had generated $300,000 in sales, but there was a catch: to access these earnings, he needed to pay a $135,000 ‚Äúfee.‚Äù Trusting the scheme, the artist liquidated his retirement account, maxed out his credit cards, and even took out a loan to cover the amount. Once the payment was made, the promised profits never materialized, leaving the artist financially and emotionally devastated. A Network of Fraudulent Sites Uncovered Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez revealed that the tactics used in this case led investigators to uncover a broader network of 40 fraudulent websites targeting artists. The investigation, spearheaded by the DA‚Äôs Virtual Currency Unit, traced the stolen funds to accounts in Nigeria. The funds were primarily converted to Nigerian currency, closing off avenues for recovery. Some of the fake NFT marketplaces went beyond scamming users for money. They also sought to gain access to victims‚Äô cryptocurrency wallets by asking for seed phrases. This would allow scammers to completely drain a user‚Äôs wallet, further compounding financial losses. This case is not an isolated incident. The DA‚Äôs office disclosed that two additional artists, one from Georgia and another from California, were duped by the same scam. The counterfeit marketplaces‚Äô resemblance to legitimate platforms like OpenSea demonstrate the increasing sophistication of cybercriminals in the NFT and crypto sectors. The case has drawn attention to the vulnerabilities artists face in the evolving NFT market, where the promise of high profits often clouds judgment. Scams involving fake NFT marketplaces, phishing attacks, and seed phrase theft are becoming alarmingly common, exposing both novice and seasoned creators to significant financial risks. District Attorney Gonzalez emphasized the importance of raising awareness to prevent further victims. ‚ÄúIt is my hope that by shutting these domains and raising awareness about this scheme, we will prevent others from falling victim to this scam,‚Äù he stated. The DA‚Äôs office offered the following advice to artists: Use Established Platforms: Sell your work only on well-known, reputable NFT marketplaces. Platforms like OpenSea and Rarible have established trust in the community and have mechanisms to report suspicious activity. Beware of Phishing Attempts: Avoid clicking on links in unsolicited emails or messages, especially those that direct you to mint or sell NFTs on unfamiliar platforms. Protect Your Wallet: Never share your cryptocurrency wallet‚Äôs seed phrase. Legitimate platforms and transactions will never require this information. Verify Opportunities: If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Seek advice from fellow artists or trusted sources before proceeding. The Brooklyn DA‚Äôs investigation shows the need for increased vigilance in the digital art and cryptocurrency spaces. The lack of regulatory oversight in these emerging markets has made them fertile ground for scams and fraudulent activities. While shutting down the fraudulent websites is a significant victory, the recovery of funds remains a challenge, especially when the money is quickly transferred and converted in jurisdictions with limited cooperation. This case highlights the need for international collaboration in addressing crypto-related crimes and protecting victims. As NFTs continue to grow in popularity, so too do the risks associated with their adoption. This case serves as a stark reminder that while the digital art market offers new opportunities for creators, it also comes with unique challenges. Artists and collectors alike must remain vigilant and take proactive steps to safeguard their work and investments. For now, the Brooklyn District Attorney‚Äôs Office hopes that its efforts to shut down fraudulent websites and educate the public will deter future scams and provide a measure of justice for victims of these schemes.",NEGATIVE,ADA,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING | AIRDROP,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6420/cardano-foundation-x-account-hacked-in-fake-token-scam,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Here‚Äôs What You Should Know,"The post Has Cardano Rally Called Off? Will ADA Price Remain Within Consolidated Range? Here‚Äôs What You Should Know appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The ADA price is the short timeframe that hints at a probable pullback as the bulls remain passive. Being in the top 10, the token tends to follow the star token, Bitcoin, struggling to rise and sustain above the threshold at $100K. Besides, Ethereum has also plunged below $4000, which is circulating Berish waves across the markets, including the Cardano price rally. The third-generation token reached the levels not tested in the past couple of years and is also expected to breach the upper resistance if held firmly. The ADA price traded within a massive falling wedge since the rejection from its ATH and after breaking out from the range, the token set off a 125% rise. The current trading pattern suggests the bulls have entered an exhaustion phase after printing massive bullish candles for 5 consecutive weeks. Therefore, the price of Cardano crypto is believed to trade within a range-bound for a few days until the liquidity flows back into the asset. The weekly chart of the ADA price rally suggests the token remains under bearish influence regardless of the recent rally. Although the price underwent a more than 125% jump, the Gaussian channel remains bearish. This channel indicates the trend pattern of the rally and also suggests the potential trading opportunities. A rise above the upper bands of the channel suggests the token reaching the highest level of volatility, which may open the doors of a trend reversal or correction. As a result, the channel remains bearish and the divergence in RSI substantiates the claim. Meanwhile, the current pullback can also offer a good entry point at around $0.984 or at $0.748 if the markets are correcting wider. After a rebound, a new ATH could be imminent, as it happened previously before the 2021 bull run. Therefore, the ADA price rally is expected to set off after a brief reversal to the lower targets and any range below $1 can be a good entry point as the price is primed to rise above $5 in the upcoming bullish cycle.",NEUTRAL,ADA,ADA | ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/has-cardano-rally-called-off-will-ada-price-remain-within-consolidated-range-heres-what-you-should-know/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Investors who were left sidelined are now looking into projects that have just started rising or are gearing up for the next massive leg up. While Pepe (PEPE) is an obvious choice, Lunex Network could vastly outperform it thanks to its magnitudes lower market cap, and significantly greater room for growth. Let‚Äôs dive deeper! Ripple Is Cooling Off After Memorable Rally Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in the US presidential elections has reignited investor sentiment and the market reacted immediately, with Ripple (XRP) leading the surge. Ripple in a single uninterrupted move from $0.55 to $2.80 in a matter of weeks. However, at the peak, selling pressure intensified, forcing a pullback.

""Though bitcoin is currently a volatile asset ‚Äì as Amazon stock has been at times throughout its history ‚Äì corporations have a responsibility to maximize shareholder value over the long-term as well as the short-term. Diversifying the balance sheet by including some bitcoin solves this problem without taking on too much volatility,"" according to a shareholder proposal shared by conservative think tank the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR).  ""At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin,"" the proposal added.  Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has surged 134% this year, topping the $100,000 mark in a move that has outshined every major asset, including gold and the S&P 500. That said, shares in bitcoin holder MicroStrategy have seen even more significant gains, more than 500% versus Amazon's 49% rise.  The shareholders' proposal highlighted MSTR's outperformance, along with BTC adoption by companies like Tesla and Block, while emphasizing that the online retailer has a fiduciary duty to look beyond short-term volatility in assets like BTC, which appreciate more than bonds and add those to its Treasury.  At the end of the third quarter, Amazon had $585 billion in total assets, of which $88 billion represented cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including Treasury notes, foreign government and corporate bonds. The asset mix isn't adequately protecting the shareholder value, the proposal said.   Last month, the NCPPR submitted a similar shareholder from Microsoft shareholders, urging the tech giant to diversify into bitcoin. Microsoft shareholders are scheduled to vote on their bitcoin consideration proposal on Dec. 10.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/09/amazon-shareholders-push-for-minimum-5-bitcoin-allocation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/930184e4f0194d1736e91bdf859bdb32e8e0c816-4752x3168.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.20 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $1.240 resistance zone. Cardano Price Eyes Fresh Increase After struggling above $1.30, Cardano started a downside correction. ADA unperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum with a drop below the $1.20 level. The price even spiked below $1.150 before the bulls appeared. A low was formed at $1.1173 before the price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $1.140 and $1.1550 resistance levels. The price surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.326 swing high to the $1.117 low. However, the bears are now active near the $1.25 zone.

On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1.20 zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.20 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The first resistance is near $1.2250. The next key resistance might be $1.2450. If there is a close above the $1.2450 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $1.2780 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $1.320. Another Decline in ADA?

Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple Labs, a blockchain-based global payments solution, met with CBS News on Dec. 6 to discuss political action committees and their influence on the U.S. Presidential election. The CEO said that If SEC chair Gary Gensler hadn‚Äôt aggressively regulated cryptocurrencies, Fairshake , a federal-independent expenditure-only committee registered with the Federal Election Commission, wouldn‚Äôt exist. He said, ‚Äú I‚Äôm not sure Fairshake would exist ‚Äú.

In fact, the agency had filed more than 120 lawsuits against crypto companies, including Ripple Labs, Uniswap, Terraform Labs, Coinbase, Binance , and Kraken-citing violations of securities laws. According to Garlinghouse, the enforcement actions created an unlikely unity within the crypto industry, giving rise to the PAC.

On being asked whether the PAC is charged with a political motive in mind, the 53-year-old CEO elaborated that the mission of the PAC is not political influence but rather a framework to push for a balanced legal framework to ensure blockchain technology can scale and grow in the U.S. This aligns with President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs 2024 campaign manifesto, which emphasized transforming the U.S. into a global leader in cryptocurrency in Nashville in Jul. 2024.

Savvy investors who took profits are now rotating capital into undervalued gems primed for explosive growth in 2025. One such project is Lunex Network , which has consistently gained traction throughout its viral presale, raising over $4.6 million in record time. Let‚Äôs delve deeper and discover why this newcomer could leave Solana and Ripple in the dust. Solana Continues To Consolidate Just Below ATH After reaching a new all-time high at $263, Solana corrected by about 11% and is currently ranging around $240 as it found rock-solid support at $230. At press time, Solana sells for $238 with a 2.1% intraday increase and a 43% decline in volume, with roughly $4.6 billion worth of SOL traded in the last 24 hours. However, holders are still decisively bullish on Solana as every dip has been bought up almost immediately. According to on-chain readings from Lookonchain , whale activity has skyrocketed over the past few days, with large buyers acquiring massive quantities of Solana at discounted prices. Over the week, roughly $42 million, or 185,000 SOL tokens, has been withdrawn from Binance. Ripple Fails To Reclaim $3 At First Try, What‚Äôs Next? In November, Ripple (XRP) became one of the top performers with a 400% rally that saw it tear through resistance levels and reach a new peak at $2.80. As traders booked profits, a pullback followed, and today, Ripple trades at $2.44 with a 6.9% daily increase. Between the reported settlement with the SEC and the incoming release of a Ripple stablecoin, major bullish catalysts are lining up for the XRP price. After months of intensive testing, the RLUSD stablecoin‚Äôs launch is inching closer. Many Ripple investors are positioning themselves to capitalize on this significant liquidity event that could see Ripple soar above $3 by the end of the year. Lunex Network Is Spearheading The New DEX Revolution Lunex Network is more than just another run-of-the-mill decentralized exchange. It‚Äôs a non-custodial protocol that integrates all major blockchains and allows for seamless swaps between more than 50,000 assets at the lowest possible fee without any of the liquidity issues typical of most DEXs. Aside from providing an intuitive and frictionless DEX experience, Lunex Network boasts a wide array of features that could see its adoption skyrocket in the upcoming months. Institutional investors and businesses will find an exclusive B2B payment bridge API. This means that they can easily integrate cryptocurrencies into their payment options and have them instantly converted into fiat. Developers will have access to 65 RPC nodes to build highly scalable, decentralized applications. Users who want to take their trading to the next level can subscribe to Lunex Pro.

Moreover, Lunex Network will also grant loyal holders the opportunity to earn passive income through its revenue-sharing mechanism. Every week, Lunex Network will reinvest part of its earnings to buy back $LNEX tokens on the open market and redistribute them as staking rewards. During the ongoing presale, $LNEX tokens are priced at just $0.0038. This is the perfect entry point for buyers who want to be on the winning side of the upcoming DEX revolution led by Lunex Network.

37411763,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51692,1733720352,Expert Claims XRP Could Be Your Best Investment If You Make At Least $30k,"Cryptocurrency analyst Armando Pantoja has expressed strong optimism about XRP, asserting that it may be a prime investment opportunity for individuals with annual earnings of $30,000 or more. In a recent video shared on X, Pantoja outlined several factors driving his prediction, including XRP‚Äôs growing adoption, the potential for significant price increases, and a favorable risk-to-reward profile. Real-World Use Cases Strengthen XRP‚Äôs Appeal Pantoja emphasized that real-world use case makes XRP different from many other cryptocurrencies. According to him, XRP‚Äôs core purpose as a blockchain platform for efficient and low-cost international payments is already gaining traction among major financial institutions. ‚ÄúXRP is built for fast borderless payments and is already being adopted by major financial institutions,‚Äù Pantoja stated. He highlighted that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs real-world adoption gives it a strong foundation, providing stability and long-term growth potential in an otherwise volatile market. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, XRP‚Äôs integration into global financial systems positions it favorably to benefit from ongoing digital transformation. Ambitious Price Predictions Pantoja offered an optimistic outlook for XRP, projecting that its price could reach between $8 and $20 within 12 months. At the time of his analysis, XRP was trading at $2.40. Achieving the upper end of his forecast would represent a significant 733% increase in value. This bold prediction is grounded in three key factors: Increased Adoption: Pantoja anticipates that broader institutional adoption of XRP will boost its demand and, in turn, its value. Regulatory Clarity: The cryptocurrency sector is gradually receiving more regulatory clarity, which could enhance XRP‚Äôs credibility and attract additional investors. Pro-Crypto Administration: With Donald Trump expected to take office in January 2025, Pantoja believes a pro-cryptocurrency U.S. administration could create a favorable environment for XRP‚Äôs growth. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Compelling Risk-to-Reward Profile The analyst further highlighted XRP‚Äôs promising risk-to-reward ratio. He suggested that a modest investment of $1,000 to $2,000 in XRP could yield returns of $8,000 to $10,000 within a year. ‚ÄúThe risk-to-reward ratio here is ridiculous,‚Äù he stated, framing the opportunity as an attractive option for individuals aiming to grow their wealth. For those earning $30,000 annually, Pantoja advised allocating a portion of their income to XRP, emphasizing its potential to deliver significant returns. He pointed out that XRP has experienced a 338% price surge over the past 30 days, with most of these gains occurring in November. Historical Performance and Considerations Despite the recent rally, long-term holders of XRP are still navigating challenges. Investors who purchased XRP at its peak seven years ago face a 36% loss. This underscores the importance of timing and market conditions when considering cryptocurrency investments.

37410346,https://coinpedia.org/?p=390753,1733720213,Cardano Price Prediction For December 9,"The post Cardano Price Prediction For December 9 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The current price action of ADA is still showing signs of consolidation , with no breakout to the upside yet. At the time of writing, ADA is trading slightly below the $1 mark and has drifted into the red zone. However, the coin has gained more than 12 percent in the last one week. Currently, there is support between $0.83 and $1.16, with the most relevant support levels being $0.93 and $0.83. A drop below $0.83 would shift towards a larger correction taking place. At the moment, the market is primarily showing a sideways consolidation, and this is being respected by the micro support levels we‚Äôve outlined. Key Levels to Watch If ADA breaks below the $1.11 level, which is also a Fibonacci support level, it would make it more likely that the market is forming a larger wave. For now, ADA remains in a consolidation phase, and while the price action might seem a bit dull, it could soon break out of this sideways movement. The most recent low of $1.16 from December 5th could be the key level to watch. Below that, the next support levels would be between $0.83 and $1.16, though it‚Äôs not guaranteed that ADA will dip all the way down to $0.83. Instead, if this assumption holds, the support may be found in the upper half of that range. With Cardano‚Äôs price showing signs of consolidation and exciting market opportunities ahead, read our long-term Cardano price prediction for insights on its future potential! Next Target After a Breakout The primary level to watch for an upside breakout is the trendline forming the triangle pattern. If ADA breaks above the $1.24‚Äì$1.25 range, this would signal a potential upward breakout. The next target after that would be the $1.42 level, with $1.72 as an important target. However, this scenario is contingent on whether the market confirms that we are indeed in a triangle pattern, as this is still not fully confirmed. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37410148,https://coinpedia.org/?p=390738,1733719846,Amazon Shareholders Push for Bitcoin Investment: Will It Happen?,"The post Amazon Shareholders Push for Bitcoin Investment: Will It Happen? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News What if Amazon started investing in Bitcoin? That‚Äôs the big idea Amazon shareholders are pitching right now. They want the company to put 5% of its assets into the cryptocurrency. Why? They see it as a way to protect against inflation and, honestly, just make better use of Amazon‚Äôs massive reserves. But, is this as smart as they think? Or is it one of those ideas that sounds good until it‚Äôs not? Let‚Äôs figure it out. Why Bitcoin? Let‚Äôs Look at the Numbers Okay, here‚Äôs the thing. Bitcoin‚Äôs been on a wild ride lately. It grew by 131% in 2024 alone. Over the last five years, it‚Äôs jumped more than 1,200%. That‚Äôs a lot, right? Now compare that to corporate bonds or cash‚Äîwhat Amazon usually keeps in reserve. Those are safe, sure, but they don‚Äôt grow like this. That‚Äôs why the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), the group behind the proposal , is pushing hard. They‚Äôre basically saying, ‚ÄúHey, Amazon, don‚Äôt sit on this. Even a 5% Bitcoin allocation could be huge for long-term value.‚Äù The National Center for Public Policy Research has submitted the attached shareholder proposal to https://t.co/Lve7Kg1nVI , Inc. for consideration at the 2025 annual shareholder meeting. Shareholders request that the Board assess adding #Bitcoin to the Company‚Äôs Treasury pic.twitter.com/lsgHC0aGrt ‚Äî Tim Kotzman (@TimKotzman) December 8, 2024 And they‚Äôre not wrong. Companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy have already gone for it, and they‚Äôve seen some solid gains. Even Microsoft shareholders will vote on a similar idea soon. It‚Äôs becoming a trend. But not everyone‚Äôs convinced‚Äîyet. As institutions increasingly adopt Bitcoin, its market potential continues to grow‚Äîread our Bitcoin price prediction for expert insights on what‚Äôs next! What If Amazon Goes for It? If Amazon says yes, it won‚Äôt be instant. First, the board has to agree to let shareholders vote on the proposal in April 2025. And even then, they‚Äôd probably start small. Nobody‚Äôs talking about going all-in on Bitcoin here. Source: NCPPR Still, this could shake things up. Some people, like Binance‚Äôs former CEO Changpeng Zhao, are even speculating that Amazon might take it a step further‚Äîlike accepting Bitcoin payments. That sounds futuristic, right? Imagine buying your next Kindle or headphones with Bitcoin. But, honestly, there‚Äôs no guarantee Amazon will go for it. They haven‚Äôt said a word about this idea publicly. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Podcaster Tim Kotzman shared the proposal on X , which pointed out Bitcoin‚Äôs superior performance over corporate bonds and referencing similar investments by companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla. The think tank‚Äôs letter criticizes the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which shows a 4.95% inflation rate, as an unreliable measure of currency debasement. It argues the true inflation rate could be twice as high. Further, the letter warned that this undermines Amazon‚Äôs $88b in cash and short-term assets. To protect shareholder value, it recommended using Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. The National Center for Public Policy Research has submitted the attached shareholder proposal to https://t.co/Lve7Kg1nVI , Inc. for consideration at the 2025 annual shareholder meeting.

Microsoft Rejects Bitcoin Investment Push The NCPPR‚Äôs proposal aligns with a broader push for institutional Bitcoin adoption. In October, it urged Microsoft to invest in Bitcoin through a similar letter. However, Microsoft advised shareholders to reject it , stating management already evaluates such matters. The proposal will be discussed this week at Microsoft‚Äôs annual meeting on Dec. 10. Amazon Invests in Blockchain, But Has So Far Avoided Crypto Meanwhile, Amazon has not confirmed plans to hold cryptocurrency on its balance sheet. However, it offers a managed blockchain service through Amazon Web Services and has posted job listings for digital currency and blockchain experts. Despite this, Amazon still does not accept cryptocurrency as payment on its shopping platform. MicroStrategy led the way in adopting Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset among public companies. In Aug. 2020, it began buying Bitcoin to guard against inflation and economic risks.

Dogecoin (DOGE) has been one of the top performers in the ongoing market-wide upsurge that began on the back of the Donald Trump victory on Nov. 5. For context, DOGE traded at a price of $0.1595 on Nov. 3. However, as developments around the U.S. election gained steam, it spiked, closing November at $0.4416, a 164% gain.Amid the bullish price momentum, several entities have projected new timelines for Dogecoin to claim some lofty targets. Previously, analysts predicted DOGE to claim ambitious heights. For instance, in October, Ali Martinez predicted a Dogecoin rally to $10. Meanwhile, market watcher Trader Tardigrade expects a possible run to $20.Interestingly, Trader Tardigrade also presented a more audacious Dogecoin target in early October, when the token had not witnessed its recent uptrend. The analyst projected that DOGE could rally to a peak of $30 before facing correction.New Projected Timelines for Dogecoin to Hit $10, $20 and $30Amid its latest 164% spike, some market speculators have adjusted the possible timelines for Dogecoin to reach these targets. For instance, analysts at the crypto exchange platform Changelly believe that DOGE has immense potential. However, they do not expect it to reach $1 until January 2030. Dogecoin Price Predictions Changelly Dogecoin Price Predictions | Changelly Further, these analysts see Dogecoin rising gradually as the year's progress. According to them, Dogecoin could reach the $10 price in January 2040 and further grow exponentially to $20 in March 2040, two months later. They then expect DOGE to hit $30 a month after in April 2040.ChatGPT and Grok AI RespondMeanwhile, we queried AI chatbots ChatGPT and Grok on potential timelines for Dogecoin to reach the $10, $20 and $30 price levels.¬†Notably, ChatGPT predicts Dogecoin could reach $10 by 2029‚Äì2034 under optimistic scenarios. According to ChatGPT, this requires rapid adoption, institutional support, and integration into global payments.However, the chatbot‚Äôs moderate timeline for DOGE to reach $10 extends to 2035‚Äì2040, while it deems the price target unlikely under pessimistic conditions. This pessimistic scenario could be the case without massive changes to its supply mechanics.For $20, ChatGPT suggests an optimistic timeline of 2035‚Äì2040, depending on revolutionary use cases and supply control. A moderate projection spans 2040‚Äì2045, while the pessimistic timeline places it beyond 2045.Interestingly, ChatGPT forecasts an optimistic timeline of 2045‚Äì2055 for DOGE to reach $30, requiring Dogecoin to dominate global finance. The chatbot presents a moderate timeline beyond 2055 but believes the $30 price target is unlikely in a pessimistic scenario.Nonetheless, Grok provides alternative views. For $10, sources suggest timelines ranging from 2025 to 2044. Predictions for $20 and $30 are sparse and often deemed improbable without extraordinary conditions.

Shiba Loves Trump (SHIBTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHIBTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Shiba Loves Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Loves Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Shiba Loves Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.

If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

Atkins, who served under President George W. Bush, will replace outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler. After this big announcement, the financial community has been buzzing about the SEC‚Äôs alleged settlement offer to Ripple Labs and legal experts are split on whether the SEC will appeal the ruling or ask for more time A user asked former SEC employee Marc Fagel about the likelihood of the SEC dropping the Ripple lawsuit, especially since it‚Äôs at the second court of appeals. Fagel responded, saying that while the SEC could technically dismiss the appeal, it‚Äôs difficult to predict. ‚ÄúThe SEC could presumably dismiss the appeal. It‚Äôs hard to predict; Atkins is no fan of crypto enforcement actions, but he also respects the SEC and its mission and might be reluctant to take such a largely unprecedented, purely political step,‚Äù he wrote. He explained that new SEC Chairman Paul Atkins is not a fan of crypto enforcement actions but also respects the SEC‚Äôs role. As a result, he may be hesitant to make such a politically charged decision. What‚Äôs Next? The outcome of Donald Trump‚Äôs election could have an impact on crypto regulation. Experts believe that under Trump‚Äôs leadership, the SEC may adopt a different approach to overseeing cryptocurrency. This could lead to more crypto-friendly policies and less aggressive enforcement. Furthermore, Trump has appointed David Sacks, a venture capitalist and co-host of the All-In Podcast, as the ‚ÄúWhite House AI & Crypto Czar.‚Äù Sacks, who is also the former COO of PayPal, is known for supporting Ripple in its ongoing lawsuit with the US SEC.

Qubetics Offers a Path to Redemption,"The crypto space is buzzing with activity, and SUI has been at the centre of it all. This Layer 1 blockchain took the market by storm with its explosive rally, capturing the imagination of investors worldwide. Those who entered the SUI ecosystem early have likely seen exponential gains, but not everyone had the chance to capitalise on its meteoric rise. Fortunately, a new opportunity has emerged. Qubetics ($TICS) offers a fresh perspective and innovative features, positioning itself as the best crypto for 2024. At the heart of its success is a game-changing application: its multi-chain wallet. Designed to revolutionise asset management across blockchains, Qubetics promises to fill the gaps left by its predecessors and chart a new course in the blockchain landscape. SUI: The Trailblazer That Set the Stage SUI earned its stripes as a next-generation blockchain optimised for decentralised applications (dApps) and digital asset creation. Boasting remarkable scalability and efficiency, the network‚Äôs innovative consensus mechanism supports high transaction throughput with minimal energy consumption. It‚Äôs no wonder SUI captured the attention of developers and enterprises looking for robust solutions. Over the past year, SUI has gained significant traction, with numerous dApps integrating onto its platform and a growing ecosystem of DeFi projects. Analysts project its price could climb further, especially as more use cases emerge within its ecosystem. However, despite its success, SUI is not without limitations. Cross-chain compatibility remains a challenge, leaving users juggling multiple wallets and platforms to manage their assets. SUI‚Äôs rally was undoubtedly a highlight of 2024, but it‚Äôs clear that the blockchain industry needs solutions that bridge the gap between networks. This is where Qubetics steps in to redefine the playing field. Qubetics ($TICS): Multi-Chain Wallet Innovation Qubetics has introduced a multi-chain wallet that reimagines how users interact with blockchain networks . By integrating Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and other major chains into a single interface, the wallet streamlines asset management like never before. For users frustrated by the fragmentation of the crypto ecosystem, Qubetics delivers a seamless, unified experience. Imagine a freelancer who receives payments in various cryptocurrencies. Switching between wallets and converting tokens often leads to wasted time and unnecessary fees. Qubetics‚Äô multi-chain wallet simplifies this process, consolidating transactions into one platform with real-time analytics and cross-chain functionality . This isn‚Äôt just convenient‚Äîit‚Äôs transformative. For enterprises, the wallet‚Äôs potential is equally compelling. A global retailer managing supply chain payments across multiple jurisdictions can leverage Qubetics to settle transactions efficiently, reducing operational overhead. Meanwhile, an NFT creator can mint, store, and sell tokens on different blockchains without leaving the platform. Market Confidence and Investment Potential The presale performance of $TICS underscores the market‚Äôs confidence in Qubetics. Over 288 million tokens have been sold to more than 7,500 holders, raising $5 million. At $0.0282 per token, investors are entering at an attractive price point before an anticipated 10% surge in the next stage. Analysts predict $TICS could reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, translating to a 783% ROI. Long-term forecasts place $TICS at $1 post-presale and $15 following the mainnet launch, making it one of the best crypto for 2024. A $100 investment in $TICS today secures approximately 3,546 tokens. If the token reaches $0.25, that investment grows to $886.50. At $5, it becomes $17,730, and at $15, a staggering $53,190. These projections illustrate the significant upside potential for early adopters. Conclusion While SUI set a high bar with its innovative approach and successful rally, Qubetics emerges as a blockchain project with the tools and vision to build on that momentum. Its multi-chain wallet is not just a solution to existing pain points; it‚Äôs a forward-thinking application that redefines how users and businesses interact with cryptocurrencies. For those seeking the best crypto for 2024 , Qubetics offers more than just a token‚Äîit provides a pathway to a streamlined, efficient, and interoperable blockchain experience. With its presale nearing completion and projections pointing to extraordinary returns, the time to act is now. Secure your $TICS tokens and position yourself for the future of blockchain innovation.

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address ‚Äì C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM ‚Äì in the receiving field.

If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

37407051,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624636,1733712751,Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse makes highly-anticipated appearance on 60 Minutes,"Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse appeared on CBS‚Äô 60 Minutes , delivering a sharp, unapologetic defense of Ripple‚Äôs strategies, XRP‚Äôs meteoric rise, and the crypto industry‚Äôs growing political muscle. Ripple, alongside two other crypto firms, funneled $144 million into super PACs supporting pro-crypto candidates across party lines. These efforts weren‚Äôt subtle, and the results were loud. Of the 62 congressional candidates backed by the industry (29 Republicans and 33 Democrats) 85% walked away with victories. ‚ÄúDo I think we had an impact? Absolutely,‚Äù he said. Crypto cash and political clout Ripple‚Äôs role in the 2024 election cycle was a calculated move, with one-third of all corporate donations to super PACs coming from the crypto industry. The stakes were high, and Brad, along with other industry elites, knew that they needed to seize control of the Congress. Margaret Brennan, the interviewer, pressed him on whether Ripple‚Äôs financial contributions amounted to ‚Äúbuying elections.‚Äù Brad dismissed the notion, arguing that voters ultimately made their choices, but he didn‚Äôt deny Ripple‚Äôs heavy hand in funding candidates‚Äô campaigns. ‚ÄúWe educated voters, as many industries do, about candidates,‚Äù he said, while also acknowledging, ‚ÄúWe absolutely supercharged candidates with money.‚Äù President Donald Trump‚Äôs Cabinet picks signaled a confirmation of his expected crypto-friendly approach. Treasury Secretary nominee Scott Bessent has said that ‚ÄúCrypto is about freedom and the crypto economy is here to stay.‚Äù The president also tapped Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner with ties to crypto companies, to replace outgoing Chair Gary Gensler at the Securities and Exchange Commission. He has also appointed the first-ever White House Crypto czar. The SEC‚Äôs hostile crackdown and Ripple‚Äôs fightback Ripple‚Äôs battles with the SEC are nothing new. The agency filed a lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020, alleging that XRP was an unregistered security. Brad called the lawsuit a symptom of a broader ‚Äúwar on crypto,‚Äù a conflict he says was fueled by Gensler‚Äôs leadership. ‚ÄúWhy did these companies come together and organize Fairshake? It‚Äôs a reaction to a war on crypto,‚Äù Brad said, referring to the super PAC Ripple helped create. It is now the largest crypto super PAC. Brad emphasized that Ripple has spent over $150 million fighting the SEC in court, arguing that XRP doesn‚Äôt fit the traditional definition of a security. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm reasonably intelligent about something like, ‚ÄòWhat is a security?‚Äô Never once had I considered the possibility that XRP is a security,‚Äù he said. Not everyone agrees with Ripple‚Äôs position. John Reed Stark, a former SEC official, argued that courts have consistently ruled in favor of the SEC, describing the designation of XRP as a security as ‚Äúan obvious call.‚Äù Stark, who owns no crypto and has never worked for the industry, doubled down on his critique, calling crypto ‚Äúa scourge‚Äù and pointing out its use in crimes like ransomware, sanctions evasion, and money laundering. ‚ÄúNorth Korea is financing their nuclear weapons program using crypto,‚Äù he has said. Brad dismissed such broad-brush accusations, pointing out that bad actors exist in every industry. ‚ÄúBernie Madoff went to jail. That doesn‚Äôt make every hedge fund manager a criminal,‚Äù he countered, adding that Ripple is one of the ‚Äúgood actors,‚Äù working with financial institutions to improve cross-border payments using XRP. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been asking to be regulated. Just give us clear rules of the road,‚Äù Brad said. Another thing Trump also wants to do is move the regulatory authority of crypto entirely from the SEC to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), an agency with a reputation for being more industry-friendly. But Stark said that the lighter regulatory touch will not adequately protect investors. ‚ÄúThe SEC‚Äôs mandate is investor protection. The CFTC is about market integrity. It‚Äôs a much easier regulatory regime for the crypto industry,‚Äù he said. XRP‚Äôs resurgence and Ripple‚Äôs next moves Since Election Day, XRP‚Äôs value has surged over 300%, reinforcing its position as a market leader. Ripple hasn‚Äôt wasted time capitalizing on this momentum. Brad recently announced an additional $25 million contribution to Fairshake, bringing its total funds to $103 million. The super PAC is already preparing for the next election cycle, ensuring that pro-crypto candidates remain well-funded. Despite the growing acceptance of crypto, skeptics like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and legendary investor Warren Buffet continue to dismiss it as a ‚Äúpet rock‚Äù and ‚Äúrat poison squared.‚Äù Brad brushed off such criticism, pointing to the success of the Bitcoin ETF, which launched earlier this year and attracted record-breaking investments. ‚ÄúIt attracted more assets in less time than any ETF ever before.‚Äù At press time, XRP was worth $2.50, down by 3.5% in the past twenty-four hours.",POSITIVE,XRP,ASIA | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ripple-ceo-on-60-minutes/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37407051.jpeg

XRP is currently holding above its 2021 breakout point and the price has stayed above $1.96, which is an important level. Right now, XRP is moving between the all-time high of $1.96 and the 2021 high of around $3.30. These levels create support and resistance zones. Wave Structure and Price Predictions XRP is still in a larger price structure that suggests it‚Äôs in the third wave of a bigger cycle. After the bottom in June 2022, the market has already seen waves 1 and 2. Now, it is in wave 3, and this could push the price higher in the coming months. The next target is between $5 and $10, though it‚Äôs too early to predict this accurately until the price tops in wave 3 and bottoms in wave 4. Key Support Levels to Watch The main support for XRP is currently between $1.79 and $1.96. If the price falls below these levels, the next key area of support is the orange zone, signaling a possible larger correction. However, as of now, the correction appears to be part of the third wave in a larger uptrend, so the outlook remains positive. Rapid Price Action and Potential Pullbacks The third wave has already extended to the upside, which is not unusual, but the speed of the rise is faster than typical, meaning pullbacks could be stronger. This rapid price action can lead to short-term corrections, but as long as the support levels hold, XRP should continue to rise in the longer term. Small Time Frame Correction On the smaller time frame, XRP is currently correcting, which could be a sideways movement or a counter-trend move. It‚Äôs possible we are seeing a triangle pattern forming, which often leads to a breakout. Triangles are common in crypto markets, and this could be a signal for the next price movement.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-december-9/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

While Dogecoin price remains the leading player in the meme coin space, PropiChain is emerging as a strong competitor. With its innovative platform and robust market position, PropiChain is projected to reach $1, offering potential gains of up to 10,000x by 2025. This projection positions PropiChain as a compelling alternative, possibly delivering greater returns than Dogecoin for investors Dogecoin Price Race to $2: Is the Bullish Trend Sustainable? In November 2024, Dogecoin price rose by over 165%, sparking discussions about its potential to reach $2. Currently trading at around $0.4332, the Dogecoin price has steadily increased. It experienced a 4.71% price gain in the last 24 hours, reflecting growing market demand. However, Dogecoin price hitting $2 remains a significant challenge. Achieving this would require dramatic market growth and increased adoption. Despite its popularity as a meme coin, Dogecoin needs strong institutional backing or substantial use cases. Regulatory risks, market competition, and inflationary tokenomics also limit its capacity to sustain a massive price increase shortly‚Äã. PropiChain Targets $1 from $0.004: Breaking Down the 10,000x Potential PropiChain (PCHAIN) , currently in its presale phase, is gaining attention for its ability to simplify real estate investment through blockchain technology. With tokens priced at $0.004, projections suggest it could reach $1, offering a 10,000x return for early adopters. This surge is rooted in PropiChain‚Äôs innovative use of tokenization and artificial intelligence to make real estate accessible and efficient. Fractionalized NFTs form a core part of PropiChain‚Äôs offering, allowing investors to purchase small portions of high-value properties. This lowers traditional entry barriers and democratizes real estate investment. By leveraging artificial intelligence, the platform provides detailed market analyses, asset valuations, and tailored investment suggestions. Additionally, PropiChain incorporates metaverse features, enabling users to virtually explore properties and make informed decisions, eliminating geographical limitations. PropiChain also automates transactions, enhancing efficiency in leasing and rental payments. This functionality, combined with its user-centric approach and CoinMarketCap listing, positions it as a game-changer in the global real estate market. Analysts highlight that capturing even a small fraction of this market could result in significant growth. Early investors in PropiChain are projected to see massive returns as the token advances to its next stage at $0.032, with further growth anticipated as the platform scales. This positions PropiChain as an attractive long-term investment option, especially considering the rising Dogecoin price spurring the crypto community. PropiChain‚Äôs ability to address accessibility and efficiency in real estate investment makes it a major contender. With its unique value proposition, it could outpace meme coins like Dogecoin. Propichain‚Äôs (PCHAIN) ‚Äôs Race to $1: A Game-Changer in Real Estate Tokenomics Propichain (PCHAIN) is set to revolutionize real estate investing with its innovative platform. As part of a $300 trillion real estate market projected to grow significantly over the next decade. Backed by a BlockAudit security review, PCHAIN offers trust, confidence, security, transparency, and compliance as the project scales, attracting investors eager to capitalize on its growth. The presale launched at $0.004, with projections suggesting a 10,000x return when it lists at $0.032. Analysts estimate this could translate to even more substantial gains in the long term, with a $1,000 investment potentially growing to $100,000. These figures highlight PCHAIN‚Äôs explosive potential, reinforced by its strategic focus on tokenized real estate investments.

Anchored in Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin once received 50% of the SHIB supply, burned most of it, and in doing so, became its ""reluctant godfather."" As a meme coin with utility aspirations, SHIB has expanded into a multifaceted ecosystem. Key Strengths: The ecosystem boasts the ShibaSwap DEX, plans for an algorithmic stablecoin (SHI), and SHIB: The Metaverse, where users can explore and monetize virtual land. Its DeFi angle keeps it relevant beyond mere speculation. Tokenomics: With a total supply of 589 trillion tokens, $SHIB battles inflationary challenges. However, its whale holdings at 59% indicate continued confidence from big players. Challenge: Its massive supply makes sustained price growth difficult, necessitating robust utility adoption to support its valuation. Floki ($FLOKI) Inspired by Elon Musk‚Äôs dog and backed by a strong social media presence, Floki combines memecoin charisma with tangible utility ambitions. The self-proclaimed ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs cryptocurrency‚Äù blends narrative and community power with aggressive branding. Key Strengths: With an NFT gaming metaverse (Valhalla), a DeFi suite (FlokiFi), and partnerships with Chainlink, Floki‚Äôs ecosystem promises substance beyond hype. Its FlokiFi Locker for digital assets strengthens its DeFi offering. Tokenomics: A tighter circulating supply of 9.6 trillion gives $FLOKI a structural advantage over $SHIB. However, whale dominance at 72% highlights risks of sudden sell-offs. Challenge: Floki‚Äôs reliance on hype and retail speculation makes it vulnerable in bearish or flat market conditions. Key Comparison Takeaway: SHIB offers a broader ecosystem with diversified ambitions, but FLOKI‚Äôs tighter tokenomics could lead to stronger short-term performance in bullish environments. Technical Analysis: SHIB and FLOKI ‚Äì Bullish or Barking Up the Wrong Tree? Shiba Inu ($SHIB) Since its summer bottom, SHIB has been in a healthy uptrend, confirming bullish momentum with a multi-month Cup & Handle breakout above $0.0000267. However, the breakout came on low volume, raising the probability of a pullback to this level or even deeper into the Golden Pocket (Fib 0.618) at $0.0000228. Key Targets: The Cup & Handle target sits at $0.0000415, but the $0.0000350 resistance zone, a critical level from March and 2021‚Äôs bull run, is the true test. A break above $0.0000350 could open the door for an attack on SHIB‚Äôs ATH of $0.00008845, a distant but enticing possibility. Momentum Check: Rising moving averages provide dynamic support, signaling sustained bullish momentum. Strategies: Accumulate during dips to $0.0000228‚Äì$0.0000267 for a discounted entry. Breakout traders should monitor volume closely at $0.0000350 to avoid potential bull traps. For trend-followers, buying now and riding the broader momentum with trailing stop-losses is an option. Floki ($FLOKI) FLOKI has shown a similar Cup & Handle breakout, with its next critical resistance at $0.0003. However, low volume compared to March highs suggests retail participation remains subdued, increasing the likelihood of pullbacks to the accumulation range of $0.00022‚Äì$0.00025. Key Targets: A confirmed breakout above $0.0003 sets the stage for a move to the $0.0004 Cup & Handle target. Beyond this, the ATH of $0.00035 from June looms as the next critical level. Momentum Check: A bullish market structure flip is confirmed, but sustained volume is crucial to maintain the rally. Strategies: Patient traders can accumulate within $0.00022‚Äì$0.00025, aligning with Fib retracements. Breakout traders must ensure volume spikes above $0.0003 to validate continuation toward $0.0004. Defensive players should place stink orders near $0.00018 for potential deep corrections. 3 Key Takeaways from the Comparison: SHIB‚Äôs Broader Resistance Levels: $SHIB faces significant overhead at $0.0000350 before targeting its ATH, while FLOKI‚Äôs path to $0.0004 appears less obstructed. Volume Signals Caution: Both tokens suffer from weak breakout volumes, necessitating patience and vigilance for any sustained moves. Accumulation Zones: FLOKI‚Äôs tighter range ($0.00022‚Äì$0.00025) offers clearer buy signals, while SHIB‚Äôs support zones ($0.0000228‚Äì$0.0000267) align with broader market trends. The Verdict: Which Dog Has the Sharpest Bite? When comparing these two meme-heavyweights, SHIB offers a more robust long-term narrative with its expanding ecosystem, while FLOKI thrives on short-term hype and retail-driven momentum. If you‚Äôre chasing immediate upside, FLOKI‚Äôs tighter tokenomics and aggressive branding might appeal to you. However, SHIB‚Äôs integration into the Ethereum ecosystem and ambitious roadmap for DeFi and metaverse adoption make it a safer bet for long-term believers. But remember: memecoins are speculative by nature. With Total2 signaling a potential blow-off top, volatility is the name of the game. Smart investors should keep stop-losses tight, accumulate during dips, and avoid FOMO-fueled breakouts without volume confirmation. In this crowded dog park, the real winners are the ones who plan their exits just as carefully as their entries. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Garlinghouse criticized the SEC‚Äôs approach, stating that it was a key reason why Ripple and two other companies formed the industry super PAC, FairShake, to fight back against what he described as a ‚Äúwar on crypto.‚Äù He suggested that FairShake might not have existed if the SEC had a different chairman than Gary Gensler. When an SEC spokesperson said that the amount spent by the crypto industry on legal defense is minimal compared to the losses investors have faced due to frauds and market failures, Garlinghouse revealed Ripple‚Äôs financial contributions, revealing that the company has spent over $150 million fighting the SEC‚Äôs stance on XRP. He said that Ripple argues XRP should not be treated like a stock and be subject to the same registration and disclosure requirements. Garlinghouse stressed that Ripple is not seeking to be deregulated but instead asking for clear regulations from Congress to address the unique nature of digital assets. ‚ÄúI went to Harvard Business School. I think I‚Äôm reasonably intelligent about something like, ‚ÄúWhat is a security?‚Äù So never once had I considered the possibility‚Äì that, ‚ÄúOkay, maybe XRP‚Äôs a security.

XRP Price Reacts : XRP, Ripple‚Äôs cryptocurrency, is currently experiencing a surge, approaching the $2.60 mark. At the time of writing, it was trading at $2.55, a 4.5% increase. Investors are optimistic about the future of the crypto industry, especially under a potential Trump presidency, as Ripple‚Äôs blockchain-based payment system continues to gain attention.

Trump‚Äôs Tesla (TRUMTESLA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMTESLA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump‚Äôs Tesla can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump‚Äôs Tesla could become the next viral memecoin. Trump‚Äôs Tesla launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump‚Äôs Tesla on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump‚Äôs Tesla by entering its contract address ‚Äì 8T1qq1DxSqWqoR8J9hi3ULGCCoMJdqQBev4WAvJg9awR ‚Äì in the receiving field.

If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMTESLA.

TRON bullish momentum continues With an amazing 66% increase over the previous week, the TRON price has been on an incredible upward path. Driven by a steady pattern of higher highs and higher lows, this great momentum has propelled the TRON price to a new ATH of $0.44. But the TRON price chart shows that the altcoin has just dropped by more than 20% from its ATH to less than $0.35. The price of TRON is still testing the vital $0.33 support zone; it has shown indications of rejection, suggesting a possible bullish bounce. Should the trend carry on, TRON (TRX) might shortly retest its ATH, hence initiating another notable surge. With an amazing 105% increase over the previous month, TRON (TRX) keeps displaying great upward potential. The MACD and Moving Averages among other technical indicators are clearly showing buy signals on the TRON price chart, thereby supporting the altcoin‚Äôs positive projection. These encouraging signals together with the current price action point to TRON (TRX) perhaps soon pushing past its ATH and rallying to the long-awaited $1 this cycle. Shiba Inu surges 80% in a month Showing incredible positive momentum lately, the Shiba Inu price jumped by nearly 25% in one week. Given its climb follows a period of consolidation between $0.000033 and $0.000026, the Shiba Inu price might be preparing itself for a bigger breakout. Recovering about 80% over the past month, Shiba Inu has given investors hope. On the Shiba Inu price chart, strong technical indicators including the MACD and Moving Averages flash buy signals pointing to potential continuous upward price movement of the altcoin. Notwithstanding recent increases, Shiba Inu is currently well below its all-time high of $0.000088, which was reached in 2021. Still, the positive price movement on the Shiba Inu price chart and rising market sentiment suggest that a new ATH may be within reach in the current cycle. Many analysts believe that Shiba Inu (SHIB) could soon break out from its present range based on strong buy indications on the charts, so generating fresh chances for investors. Lunex Network could outshine TRON and Shiba Inu While TRON and Shiba Inu produce waves with their bullish price movements, Lunex Network is set to redefine decentralized trading with its revolutionary features, unmatched cross-chain compatibility, and dedication to user protection and anonymity.

XRP eyes new all-time high, but sell pressure threatens XRP reached a new yearly high of $2.86 after pumping by over 300% in the past month. The altcoin could end the year better than it started, positioning patient investors for more profit. XRP is targeting the $3 price zone, rallying from $1.88 to a new yearly high within a week. However, it faces a huge resistance above $2.50, and the building pressure could see it drop. Currently, XRP ranks as the third-highest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization. The altcoin has had an impressive stride and may likely impress for most of 2025. Experts say XRP could face sell pressure in 2025, but not before it sets a new all-time high. This implies that XRP could surge beyond $3.18 early next year, but investors need to actively be on the lookout for signs of possible dump to determine the best exit time. Regardless, XRP remains a good investment at the moment and could still be in Q1 2025. Conclusion XRP looks poised for a better 2025, but investors need to be wary of a potential price dump due to a foreseen sell pressure. This makes 1Fuel a good alternative investment. The 1Fuel token has grown in prominence due its unique solutions in the DeFi space, and its expected to boom upon market launch. 1Fuel presale is a potential profit-yielding investment for investors, and it will be better not to miss out on it.

You‚Äôre in luck, mate, because we‚Äôve got three digital currencies that are hotter than a summer‚Äôs day in the outback. From the innovative Qubetics to the ever-popular Cosmos, and the powerhouse that is Polygon, this trio is poised to dominate the market. And if you‚Äôre not in on Qubetics‚Äô presale , you‚Äôre definitely going to want to get in on that action before it explodes! Let‚Äôs break down why these coins are turning heads, why they‚Äôre set to break records, and why they should be at the top of your crypto wishlist. From cutting-edge blockchain tech to scalable ecosystems and privacy features, there‚Äôs something for every investor here. So, without further ado, let‚Äôs dive in and find out why Qubetics, Cosmos, and Polygon are the best cryptos to join today! Qubetics: A Game-Changer in the Crypto Space First up, let‚Äôs talk about Qubetics, a project that‚Äôs making waves in the crypto world. If you‚Äôve been following its presale, you‚Äôll already know that this coin is showing serious promise. With more than $5 million raised and over 288 million tokens sold, Qubetics is proving to be one of the most exciting projects of 2024. So why is everyone talking about it? Qubetics isn‚Äôt just another Layer 1 blockchain‚Äîit‚Äôs designed to be scalable, secure, and interoperable. With its multi-chain compatibility , it‚Äôs positioned as a hub that can connect different blockchain ecosystems and make them work together seamlessly. This makes it perfect for decentralised applications (dApps) and smart contracts. It‚Äôs like having the perfect matchmaker for all your favourite blockchain tech. But here‚Äôs the kicker: Qubetics‚Äô presale price is just $0.0282, and analysts are predicting that when the mainnet launches, its price could soar to $10 to $15. Imagine getting in at such an early stage! If you‚Äôre looking for one of the best cryptos to join today, Qubetics is a no-brainer. Its potential growth is undeniable, and the demand for innovative, cross-chain solutions is only going to increase. Learn more about it by watching this video . Cosmos: The Internet of Blockchains Now, if you‚Äôre into the idea of blockchain interoperability, Cosmos is one to watch. Dubbed the ‚ÄúInternet of Blockchains,‚Äù Cosmos aims to solve one of the biggest challenges in the crypto space‚Äîmaking different blockchains work together. Cosmos achieves this by providing an ecosystem that allows individual blockchains to communicate and share data, without compromising their independence. It‚Äôs built around the Cosmos SDK, which enables developers to build custom blockchains tailored to their needs. This makes Cosmos a unique player in the blockchain space, offering scalability, security, and flexibility for a wide variety of use cases. What sets Cosmos apart is its Tendermint Core‚Äîthe consensus engine that ensures transactions are processed quickly and securely, all while keeping fees low. The demand for interoperable blockchains is growing rapidly, and with the launch of projects like Cosmos Hub, this ecosystem is only going to continue expanding. If you‚Äôre looking for a crypto that offers scalability and decentralised governance, Cosmos is certainly one of the best cryptos to join today. Polygon: Scaling Ethereum to New Heights Anyone who‚Äôs used Ethereum knows that while it‚Äôs powerful, it‚Äôs also notoriously slow and costly, especially when the network gets congested. Enter Polygon, which acts as a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, providing faster and cheaper transactions without compromising on security. Polygon‚Äôs sidechains enable Ethereum-based applications to scale seamlessly, making it a favourite among developers building decentralised finance (DeFi) applications, NFTs, and other dApps. The platform has gained immense traction due to its low gas fees, fast transaction speeds, and strong ecosystem. It‚Äôs no surprise that Polygon has partnered with industry giants like Microsoft, Meta, and Google Cloud. With the rapid growth of Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem, Polygon is at the forefront of Ethereum‚Äôs scalability solutions, making it one of the best cryptos to join today if you‚Äôre looking for a coin with a solid use case and a proven track record.

Each of these coins is tackling a major problem in the blockchain space, from interoperability to scalability and security. They all have solid use cases, strong communities, and innovative tech that sets them apart from the competition. Qubetics is positioning itself as a key player in cross-chain communication and decentralised finance, Cosmos is building the framework for the future of blockchain interoperability, and Polygon is scaling Ethereum to make it faster and more affordable. These coins have a lot of potential, and they‚Äôre only going to become more important as the world of blockchain and crypto continues to evolve. Wrapping Up: Don‚Äôt Sleep on Qubetics‚Äô Presale Now, if you‚Äôve been following along and thinking, ‚ÄúThese coins sound like they could really go places,‚Äù you‚Äôre right!

37403995,https://nulltx.com/?p=135375,1733706904,Best Crypto to Join This Week: Why Qubetics Stands Out Alongside Filecoin and EOS,"Analysts Tout Qubetics as Best Crypto to Join This Week While Filecoin Shines and EOS Gains Traction Are you tired of chasing crypto trends that fizzle out before you can say ‚ÄúROI‚Äù? If you‚Äôre hunting for a solid investment, it‚Äôs time to stop gambling and start planning. In a market teeming with volatility, wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to back a project with groundbreaking utility and unbeatable growth potential? Look no further. Qubetics, Filecoin, and EOS are making waves this week, and it‚Äôs time to see why. Qubetics is creating hype with its innovative approach to blockchain technology, specifically its real-world asset tokenisation. Meanwhile, Filecoin and EOS continue to hold their spots as powerhouses in the crypto community, providing unique alternatives to traditional investments. But let‚Äôs be real‚Äîonly one of these is poised to deliver life-changing returns. Qubetics: Transforming Blockchain with Real-World Asset Tokenisation Qubetics isn‚Äôt your average crypto project‚Äîit‚Äôs a Web3 aggregator with ambitions as big as its achievements. As of its 11th presale stage, Qubetics has raised over $5 million, sold 288 million tokens, and amassed more than 7,500 token holders. The token is priced at $0.0282 but is set to jump by 10% soon, making it the best crypto to join this week. What sets Qubetics apart is its real-world asset tokenisation feature. Imagine owning a piece of a skyscraper in New York or investing in fine art from your smartphone. Qubetics makes this possible by digitising real assets into blockchain tokens, breaking down barriers for businesses and individuals. For instance, a small business owner could sell shares of their company via tokenisation, while an artist could monetise their work without middlemen taking a hefty cut. This isn‚Äôt just theoretical. Picture a professional in London needing quick liquidity for a rare wine collection. Instead of lengthy bank negotiations, they tokenize their assets through Qubetics, selling shares globally in minutes. This level of flexibility is what makes Qubetics revolutionary. Analysts predict $TICS will surge to $0.25 by the end of the presale, delivering a whopping 871% ROI. And if the stars align post-mainnet launch, it could skyrocket to $15, a mind-blowing 58,213% ROI. Want in? This is the moment. Click here to learn more about this revolutionary project. Filecoin: The Storage Giant When it comes to decentralised storage, Filecoin is the name on everyone‚Äôs lips. Launched in 2020, this project revolutionised how data is stored and shared. Forget cloud servers; Filecoin uses blockchain technology to create a decentralised network where users can rent out storage space. The community loves its eco-friendly approach, too‚ÄîFilecoin optimises unused computer storage, cutting down on waste. For years, Filecoin has been a go-to for crypto enthusiasts looking for stability. Unlike speculative tokens, Filecoin provides a service that‚Äôs always in demand. Think about it: as data becomes more valuable than oil, a decentralised storage solution is a no-brainer. It‚Äôs no wonder Filecoin has earned its reputation as a secure, innovative investment. Despite its established position, Filecoin doesn‚Äôt quite offer the explosive growth potential seen in new players like Qubetics. However, as a complementary investment, it remains a reliable choice for diversifying portfolios. EOS: The Developer‚Äôs Playground EOS burst onto the crypto scene with a mission to outdo Ethereum. Promising lightning-fast transactions and zero gas fees, it aimed to solve the scalability issues that plagued early blockchains. Today, EOS is best known for its ability to host decentralised applications (dApps) seamlessly, making it a favourite among developers. What‚Äôs kept EOS relevant is its flexibility. Developers building games, DeFi projects, or NFT platforms turn to EOS for its robust infrastructure. And the ecosystem is thriving‚Äîthousands of active dApps are proof of its resilience in a competitive market. But let‚Äôs not sugarcoat it: while EOS offers solid utility, its growth trajectory has been relatively flat compared to rising stars like Qubetics. Still, its loyal community and established use cases make it a stronghold in the crypto world. Why Qubetics Is the Best Crypto to Join This Week Filecoin and EOS are great for what they do, but neither matches the sheer ROI potential Qubetics offers. With analysts forecasting astronomical returns, it‚Äôs clear why this project is stealing the limelight. Add its groundbreaking real-world asset tokenisation to the mix, and you‚Äôve got a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Qubetics is more than just a promising investment; it‚Äôs a movement. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned investor or a crypto newbie, now is the time to join the 7,500+ holders who‚Äôve already seen its potential. So, what‚Äôs next? Dive into the Qubetics presale while the price is still $0.0282, and watch your investment grow. Don‚Äôt wait for the weekend price surge‚Äîsecure your $TICS tokens today. Conclusion: Your Move If you‚Äôre serious about making money in crypto, it‚Äôs time to act. Filecoin and EOS offer stability and utility, but Qubetics is the best crypto to join this week for life-changing ROI. Imagine looking back in a year and realising you hesitated at $0.0282. Don‚Äôt let this opportunity slip through your fingers. Discover the future of blockchain today. Ready to make your move?

Discover This December 2024 Blockchain Gem,"The cryptocurrency market is ablaze with innovation and growth, making headlines daily. As December 2024 unfolds, blockchain projects like EOS have left an indelible mark on the space. EOS emerged as a major contender in the blockchain arena, offering a robust ecosystem for decentralised applications (dApps). However, while its initial promise was undeniable, new opportunities have surfaced to capture the attention of investors. Qubetics ($TICS) has entered the spotlight, showcasing a clear vision to address critical challenges that other projects, including EOS, have yet to resolve. With a focus on real-world applications like Real World Asset Tokenisation, Qubetics is cementing itself as one of the best crypto investments for 2024. Let‚Äôs explore how these two projects stack up and why Qubetics is capturing significant interest. EOS: The Blockchain Pioneer That Fell Short of Expectations EOS gained notoriety for its ambitious goal of becoming the ‚ÄúEthereum killer.‚Äù As a high-performance blockchain, EOS promised unparalleled scalability and transaction speeds, drawing significant attention during its record-breaking $4 billion ICO. For a time, it seemed like EOS could revolutionise the way dApps were built and operated. Developers flocked to the platform, attracted by its zero transaction fees and efficient consensus mechanism. In recent months, EOS has seen renewed interest as it works to re-establish its foothold in the market. The network‚Äôs advancements in resource allocation, such as the PowerUp model, have addressed some of its early shortcomings. Analysts predict that if EOS continues on its current trajectory, its price could surge by mid-2025, especially as more projects integrate onto its platform. However, lingering concerns around centralisation and governance have dampened its appeal. Despite its historical significance, EOS faces stiff competition from newer, more versatile platforms. Investors seeking the best crypto investments are increasingly exploring options that prioritise interoperability, scalability, and user-centric solutions. Enter Qubetics, a blockchain project designed to meet these demands. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Blockchain Utility Qubetics has positioned itself as a revolutionary blockchain with a focus on Real World Asset Tokenisation. This approach aims to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and practical applications, making it accessible to businesses, professionals, and individuals alike. The platform‚Äôs QubeQode IDE is an intuitive development environment that simplifies the creation and deployment of blockchain-based solutions. Real World Asset Tokenisation is a standout feature of Qubetics. Picture a manufacturing company looking to streamline its supply chain. By tokenising inventory assets, the company can track shipments in real-time, reducing inefficiencies and enhancing transparency. Similarly, a property management firm can tokenize real estate assets to facilitate fractional ownership, broadening access to investment opportunities for a global audience. For individuals, the benefits are equally transformative. Consider an artist aiming to monetise digital creations. Qubetics makes it possible to mint and sell NFTs seamlessly, removing the complexity that often deters creators. By integrating multiple blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, the platform ensures users can operate within a unified, cross-chain ecosystem. The Presale That Stand Out The ongoing $TICS presale has captured significant attention, solidifying Qubetics‚Äô position as one of the best crypto investments for 2024. Over 288 million tokens have been sold to more than 7,500 holders, raising $5 million. With a current price of $0.0282, $TICS presents an accessible opportunity for investors ahead of an anticipated 10% price increase in the 12th stage of the presale. An investment of $1,500 in $TICS today secures approximately 53,191 tokens. By the end of the presale, when $TICS is projected to reach $0.25, the investment grows to $13,297.75. If $TICS reaches $5 post-presale, the value rises to $265,955. At $15, following the mainnet launch, this initial investment could soar to an extraordinary $797,865. These figures illustrate the transformative potential of investing in Qubetics early. Conclusion While EOS remains a significant name in the cryptocurrency world, Qubetics offers a fresh perspective and innovative solutions to some of the blockchain industry‚Äôs most pressing challenges. Its emphasis on real-world applications, combined with its presale success and ambitious roadmap, makes $TICS a standout contender for those seeking the best crypto investments. With the presale nearing completion and projections indicating substantial returns, the opportunity to invest in Qubetics at a competitive price is closing fast. For investors aiming to position themselves at the forefront of blockchain innovation, securing $TICS tokens today could be the key to unlocking remarkable growth in 2024 and beyond.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Cardano surpasses $1 with a $10 target for 2025, while Pepe Unchained and Rollblock fuel investor excitement for major gains. Table of Contents Cardano expected to target $10 by early 2025 Pepe Unchained gains momentum 3 days before token launch Rollblock investors prepare for 880% gains ahead of official token launch Cardano has crossed a critical price target of $1, but analysts are already expecting the token to surge towards $10 in 2025. Pepe Unchained is also gaining hype as it prepares for the official token launch and claim which is scheduled to start on December 10. Meanwhile, Rollblock‚Äôs presale is giving traders the perfect entrance to the explosive altcoin market as this GambleFi project is poised for 880% gains before its official launch. Cardano expected to target $10 by early 2025 Cardano ‚Äôs price has already surged by a massive 241.72% during the last month as investors regained interest in altcoins. Since Cardano has recently announced its Hydra upgrade for more scalability and Mithril upgrade to streamline consensus, analysts expect Cardano to attract even more investors in the next few weeks. If these bullish predictions stand true, Cardano‚Äôs price could reach a new high at $10 in early 2025. Cardano is currently trading for $1.21 after an intraday decrease of 1.34%. Cardano‚Äôs volume has also dropped by 21.68% during this period which suggests low network activity. If Cardano can breach its nearest resistance at $1.38 soon, analysts believe Cardano could target a price level of $2.51 before the end of Q4. Pepe Unchained gains momentum 3 days before token launch Pepe Unchained experienced an explosive presale which raised more than $73 million in record time. Since Pepe Unchained‚Äôs presale is completely sold out, analysts are expecting a massive rally on the token‚Äôs official launch day. Pepe Unchained will be available on DEXs in 3 days which is creating a strong bullish momentum around the token. Since Pepe Unchained is giving traders 100 times faster speeds and cheaper gas fees than Ethereum, analysts expect Pepe Unchained to become a top exchange for meme coins. Since Ethereum‚Äôs price has also crossed the $4000 milestone this week, Pepe Unchained is likely to attract a variety of ETH investors to its Layer 2 blockchain. Rollblock investors prepare for 880% gains ahead of official token launch Rollblock has been on an uptrend ever since its presale launch, but it is completely dominating the ongoing altseason. As Rollblock draws closer to raising $7 million in its viral presale, analysts are expecting RBLK‚Äôs early investors to enjoy up to 880% gains even before the token‚Äôs official launch on the open market. These bullish predictions for Rollblock are fueled by a unique strategy to bring decentralized and centralized gaming experiences together on a single platform. By resolving the problem of third-party manipulation and subpar security, Rollblock is ready to take over the entire global gambling market, which is already worth more than $500 billion per annum. Since Rollblock prioritizes user security and experience, the platform has integrated Ethereum‚Äôs immutable blockchain technology to encrypt all financial information and bets. This means that traders can access more than 7,000 AI-powered games on Rollblock‚Äôs GambleFi platform and enjoy a fully secure and provably fair experience. If that wasn‚Äôt enough, then Rollblock has already announced a new betting feature that will be available on its platform soon. Through this feature, users will be able to place bets on top sports leagues around the world by using their digital assets and protecting themselves from bet manipulation. Considering these features, Rollblock‚Äôs current selling price of $0.041 per token is a massive steal for savvy traders who want to capitalize on this low entry point before the RBLK token skyrockets. Although Rollblock has just entered its ninth presale round, analysts are expecting RBLK‚Äôs limited supply to run out soon.

37403498,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=659112,1733706013,"PEPE Hits New All-Time High, Market Cap Surpasses $10 Billion","This bull cycle has been filled with the craze of meme coins, with prominent platforms like Pump.fun spawning new tokens almost every day. At the same time, popular meme coins, like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE, have continued their exponential growth trajectory. PEPE, for instance, has now forged a new all-time high price of $0.00002644 less than a month after shattering its previous record-high price. This latest price spike highlights the bullish momentum the meme token has been enjoying over the past few weeks. PEPE Price Overview As of this writing, the value of the Pepe token stands around $0.00002597, reflecting an impressive 21% price surge in the past 24 hours. This single-day performance is in stark contrast to how the meme coin had moved all week long. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Breakout: Charting The Uncertain Part Of ETH To $18,000 According to data from CoinGecko, the price of PEPE has soared by nearly 27% in the past seven days. However, it is worth noting that the altcoin was locked in a consolidation range around the $0.000022 region for most of the past week. On a broader timeframe, the price action of PEPE has been remarkable, with the meme coin more than doubling its value in the month of November. CoinGecko data shows that the price of the meme-inspired token has increased by more than 140% in the last 30 days. After a positive September, which saw the value of PEPE briefly cross the $0.00001 mark, investors expected the meme coin to take off. However, Pepe‚Äôs price failed to live up to expectations in the month of October. In November, the meme coin went on a parabolic run to crash its previous all-time high of $0.00001665 and set a new one at $0.00002343. This bullish momentum coincided with the positive climate of the general market, which saw Bitcoin reach successive all-time highs. As a result of its red-hot performance, various crypto exchanges, including Binance.US, have now listed the popular Pepe meme coin on Thursday, December 5. It appears that its listing on one of the largest crypto exchanges in the United States has helped renew its bullish momentum. PEPE Market Cap Hits $10 Billion According to data from CoinGecko, the market capitalization of PEPE has now surpassed the $10 billion mark. This value places the meme coin as the 25th largest cryptocurrency in the digital asset sector.

Cardano eyes a $1.3 breakout as momentum builds With the Cardano price up over 20% in the previous week, the altcoin has been showing notable positive momentum. Moreover, the Cardano price has exceeded the $1 resistance level and rallied to the $1.3 zone . Still, the past month has been even more remarkable since Cardano (ADA) jumped around 270%, mirroring its rising investor sentiment. The Cardano price chart shows that the altcoin has displayed great market confidence by maintaining above the $1.2 support despite encountering resistance at the $1.3 level. Experts believe Cardano might rapidly break above the $1.3 resistance and maybe even surge to $2 very soon if the bullish trend keeps up. Technical indicators are also bolstering Cardano‚Äôs positive view. As the Cardano price chart shows, key indicators, including the MACD, Moving Averages, and Awesome Oscillator all show a strong increasing trend. A classic indication of ongoing bullish pressure, Cardano (ADA) keeps producing higher highs and higher lows. Dogecoin Targets breakout to ATH Rising by almost 10% in just the past week, the Dogecoin price has been on a notable upward path. Although the Dogecoin price has lately consolidated between the $0.48 and $0.38 levels, it has had an amazing 165% growth over the previous month, therefore rekindling investor excitement. Many of the Dogecoin holders who bought the dips are now keenly awaiting the next breakout. Given the Dogecoin price chart showing that the altcoin‚Äôs present price remains around 40% below its all-time high of $0.737 from 2021, there is clearly room for notable gains particularly should Dogecoin be able to break over the $0.47 resistance level. Strong buy signals from the MACD and Moving Averages on the Dogecoin price chart help to further validate the momentum building for a possible comeback. Should Dogecoin be able to exceed its present resistance levels, we could see a rally toward the $1 mark this cycle. Lunex Network could outpace Cardano and Dogecoin Lunex Network is positioned to outpace Cardano and Dogecoin with its special mix of security, privacy, and ultra-low transaction fees, even though both altcoins exhibit encouraging indications of bullish momentum. Lunex Network is creating major excitement with over 50% of its presale tokens sold already, and early investors are already getting significant returns.
