42413437,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9EyS,1670801729,First Mover Asia: Uniswap ‘Fee Switch’ Proposal for Popular Ether Pools Stirs Up Community Debate,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin was trading steady over $17K as investors awaited the latest Consumer Price Index report and U.S. central bank interest rate decision.  Insights: Uniswap's governance proposal to pilot turning on a “fee switch” has received mostly positive reactions, but the community remains cautious.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET     As Big Events Approach, Bitcoin Trades Sideways to Hold Over $17K  By James Rubin  Crypto markets remained calm over the weekend as investors girded themselves for what will likely be the last significant events on 2022's inflation front, the release of November's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Tuesday and the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest interest rate decision a day later.  Bitcoin was recently trading at $17,114, slightly below where it stood 24 hours earlier, and when it started the weekend. With just a couple of glitches, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has held firmly above $17,000 for the past two weeks as the fallout from crypto exchange FTX's implosion and other industry debacles has slowed.  In an email to CoinDesk, Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, noted that bitcoin has managed to hold the ""17K threshold,"" although the CPI, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) rate verdict, as well as the U.S. Labor Department's latest jobless claims report on Thursday could affect prices.  ""With these key events coming up, volatility is expected but the bias remains to the upside and we’d like to see $20K on the top and respect for $16K at the bottom,"" DiPasquale wrote.  Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,275, also roughly unmoved from the previous day and when the weekend kicked off. Other major cryptos were trading slightly to the red, with decentralized network Cosmos' ATOM recently falling more than 4% and popular meme coin DOGE off 3.6%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently sank nearly 0.5%.  Stocks closed down on Friday following an unexpectedly large rise in November's producer price index (PPI), which calculates monthly wholesale prices. Core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.4%, higher than Wall Street expectations of 0.2%, suggesting that central bank measures to tame inflation have not been fully effective. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 each dropped 0.7%.  The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment offered a counterpoint to the gloom, rising to 59.1, higher than Dow Jones projections of 56.5. The index also signaled more upbeat attitudes about inflation.  The CPI fell to 7.7% for October, although the decline was not enough to satisfy monetary hawks fearful about the long-term affects of stubborn inflation. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise the interest rate 50 basis points (bps), a decline from its recent diet of four consecutive rate increases 75 bps, although Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other officials have reiterated their commitment to stem rising prices in recent weeks, and investors have fretted about the possibility of steeper, liquidity-squeezing rate hikes in 2023.  BitBull's DiPasquale wrote that investors are already expecting a 50 bps lift, although it ""could rise further upon the [FOMC] announcement.""

The proposal was put forward in July to pilot a ""fee switch"" for a small set of Uniswap protocol pools. The vote was postponed until Dec. 1 to allow more time for people to think about it. On Dec. 2, the vote moved forward and the decision was to go ahead with the test.  The switch will not increase fees for users, but will retain a small portion of what is currently paid out to liquidity providers (LP), or users who lock up their tokens on Uniswap in exchange for fee rewards.  The fee switch – if enabled considering the current conditions – could potentially mean lesser fee earnings for Uniswap’s liquidity providers and more rewards for holders of Uniswap’s native token UNI, which in turn accrues value for UNI holders.  The proposal is a pilot program and is intended to evaluate the impact of turning on the fee switch on trade execution, on a small set of Uniswap pools that utilize USD coin (USDC), dai (DAI) and ether (ETH) over a 120-day period.  The experiment will be considered a success, Uniswap’s developers said, if trading execution is not diminished for pools with the fee switch turned on. It is one of the many ongoing examples of community-led decisions that dictate the future growth of protocols like Uniswap.  Meanwhile, community reactions remain mostly positive, albeit with caution.  Some users in favor of the proposal said not moving ahead with the changes meant “stifling governance/revenue model innovation,” while some expressed concerns that liquidity providers could pull their funds from the platform.  One user called the proposal “a very important moment for Uniswap,” but opined that it was currently the “wrong time” to execute the move.  “While we may identify that the fee switch does not or has a minimal negative impact on these metrics for certain pools, taxing LPs certainly cannot help here. I see only downside across the core KPIs,” the user, tagged as “Jack_Longarzo” on Uniswap’s governance forum, said.  They added: “The other reason is that this proposal could have very serious and unpredictable negative externalities for the Uniswap community. The Uniswap Foundation’s brief discusses the severe lack of clarity for decentralized finance in the U.S. It is very possible that this proposal could negatively impact community members like Uniswap Labs, the Uniswap Foundation, and even individuals in the community. I don’t think the proposed exploration is justifiable amidst these uncertainties.”  Important events  3:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(7:00 UTC) United Kingdom Gross Domestic Product (MoM/Oct)  3:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(19:00 UTC) United States Monthly Budget Statement (Nov)  4:25 p.m. HKT/SGT(20:25 UTC) Bank of Canada's Governor Macklem Speech  CoinDesk TV  In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:  Sam Bankman-Fried Agrees to Testify Before Lawmakers; Bitcoin Regains $17K  Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, tweeted he's ""willing"" to testify at a Dec. 13 House Financial Services Committee hearing.

42411301,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMmCq,1670773800,Goldman Sachs Is Trying to Make Blockchain Bonds Happen,"This week, David Solomon (DJ D-Sol if we’re using stage names), chairman and CEO of investment bank Goldman Sachs, proved he’s stuck in the past with a Wall Street Journal opinion piece he penned titled: “Blockchain Is Much More Than Crypto.” The article was published on the heels of Goldman saying it’s planning to spend “tens of millions” on discounted crypto investments.  In the article, Solomon correctly points out that blockchain came in and disrupted heavily regulated industries like banks. Oddly, he goes on from there to claim that the deafening call for regulation means young “blockchain organizations” won’t be able to keep up with regulatory requirements. And that is especially true of cryptocurrencies, but we “shouldn’t miss the forest for the trees” – that is, we should recognize that blockchain can “support responsible innovation across the financial industry” without cryptocurrencies.  We’ve heard that one before: “I don’t know about this bitcoin thing, but there’s surely some potential in the underlying blockchain technology!”  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  To defend his position, Solomon shared how Goldman Sachs used a private blockchain to arrange a 100 million euro two-year digital bond for the European Investment Bank that was settled in 60 seconds instead of the usual five days. Praise be to its private blockchain!  The takeaway is supposed to be that Goldman will use a private blockchain to reduce settlement times, ultimately lowering costs for all stakeholders.  Except.  The reason bonds settle in five days is not because of the lack of a blockchain; it’s because of Goldman Sachs and regulation and bureaucratic red tape. Adding a private blockchain isn’t going to rid Goldman Sachs’ bond placement process of Goldman Sachs and regulation and bureaucratic red tape. Especially when that deafening call for regulation is answered.  Sure, maybe adding a blockchain is a solution, but really, it’s not for one main reason: Private, permissioned blockchains are worse than useless.  Read more: How I Lost My Faith in Private Blockchains  Blockchains have killer apps – but this isn't it  Don’t let anyone trick you; blockchains are not a complicated idea. If you know what a database is (an electronic repository of data), then you basically know what a blockchain is. Databases store data in a place. You or Goldman Sachs can access that data electronically if the database manager allows you access to that data. Otherwise, no data for you or Goldman Sachs.  Blockchains are the same thing, but all the data is public and copies of the database are stored in many disparate places. In theory, just about anyone can join and maintain their own copy of the data on a computer they know and trust.  If that sounds like a very narrow, minimal-potential use case and potentially slow technology, that’s because it is. There’s no need to allow everyone to have non-permissioned access to every piece of data all the time unless you are trying to get around needing a database manager or some other trusted third party to access that data. Something like digital money could be a good application of this technology.  Anything else, you’re better off with a regular database.  Really, the takeaway here is that blockchains are yet another round of narrow, minimal-potential-use-case technologies getting shoved into all sorts of broad applications where they simply shouldn’t be shoved. (Cue the conversation about pairing artificial intelligence with our drinking water, or whatever).  Shipping company Maersk and tech giant International Business Machines tried to blockchain-ify supply chains and put tomatoes or bananas or whatever on the blockchain through a shipping blockchain called TradeLens (whatever that means). TradeLens failed and shut down two weeks ago after almost five years of trying. It failed because it didn’t reach “the level of commercial viability necessary to continue work and meet the financial expectations as an independent business” because the idea simply isn’t viable.  I think the killer app for blockchain is decentralized money. Others think it's decentralized governance. These ideas come to life as unbanked women in Afghanistan seek financial freedom through Bitcoin and as crowdfunding efforts are organized to bid on things like the U.S. Constitution (a sillier example comparatively, sure, but pretty timely). The killer blockchain apps will most probably (and currently do) live on public, permissionless blockchains.  All said, I can assure you of one thing: The killer app won’t come from private, permissioned blockchains used to settle bond placements by huge, multinational investment banks.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/11/goldman-sachs-is-trying-to-make-blockchain-bonds-happen,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/68b56c4d1f57417e61077913cdb23f543972b61e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A brand creator with a wealth of knowledge in the crypto gambling industry. His past experiences in the sector have shaped his way of thinking about the market, leading him to find a niche where he could match his own interests with the market’s needs. Recently, we asked him a few questions about CryptoGamble.tips and the benefits it offers. Q: Let’s start with FirstByte Media. Can you refresh our readers’ memory by explaining what exactly your company does? FirstByte Media is composed of Brand Creators. Therefore, we create brands that serve users in search of valuable information. By doing so, we are incorporating the knowledge of the crypto and igaming industry we have accumulated over time. Q: Tell us about all the platforms operated by FirstByte Media FirstByte Media has three leading brands as of this moment. Our main one, CryptoGamble, is a crypto casino comparison website that helps players find reliable and accurate information about the crypto casinos and their offers (bonuses, games, etc.) BettingDose, similar in structure, provides information about crypto betting websites. We aim to educate our users about the betting markets and the advantage of crypto betting compared to traditional sports betting. MonsterGames, on the other hand, focuses on a rising trend in the igaming industry, crypto esports betting. On our website, players may find all the valuable information about it and learn what esports betting is all about and how they could use cryptocurrencies to bet on it. And soon more brands will be released, the team is working to develop more suitable projects for our future and current partners. Q: Can you please explain what CryptoGamble.tips is all about? How does it benefit the crypto community? As mentioned above, CryptoGamble is a valuable source of information and news concerning crypto casino recommendations. We poured all of our knowledge into this website and are working on improving it and providing our visitors with the most relevant and up-to-date information which will help them navigate the crypto gaming industry. We do so by reviewing each platform through our analysis process to identify and propose an objective view for all the players looking to make clear information about them. Q: What parameters does your website evaluate before listing any crypto gambling or casino platforms? The community is the main parameter we use in deciding what casinos to list and which not. Most of the new casinos are researched in forums beforehand, and that’s where we find most of the gambling houses, plus there are others that reach out directly. Lastly, we attend gambling conferences and meet most of the people working for big brands. Q: If I am a crypto gambling platform operator, how do I get my website listed on CryptoGamble.tips? A crypto gambling site can get listed by applying via our “list your site” page. Once we get the request, we start our analysis of the platform. Once we determine it’s a good fit for our audience, we review the casino – usually, the process takes 2 weeks. The last step is adding it to our 80+ crypto casino reviews directory. Q: Do you have any collaborations with gambling platform operators or game developers? Yes, we do. There are certain brands that we love more than others. However, our collaboration is available only to casinos with a particular rating score. Otherwise, there is no possibility for the casino to be promoted more than others. Meanwhile, as CryptoGamble focuses mainly on crypto casino reviews, collaboration with game developers is only one of our concerns. Still, we are publishing informative pages about them. Q: What makes CryptoGamble.tips different from other casino review and rating platforms that are currently available online? From the beginning, transparency and honesty have been our strongest motivators in overall shaping the website and brand. Keeping that in mind, we have developed a unique, unbiased rating system that can be easily accessible on our website. With the help of said rating system, we determine which crypto casinos are worthy of our visitors’ time and money. To make things even more transparent, we have recently started streaming on several platforms that include Twitch (twitch.tv/theroyalgambler) Youtube, and Dlive, where we test the casinos in our offer with our users. In this way, the visitors and we can experience the crypto casinos firsthand and build a long-lasting and, more importantly, trusting relationship with our community. Q: Can you estimate how many crypto gamers have so far benefited from your offering? From our data since the day we went online (Jan 2020), we helped more than 43k people make better decisions regarding crypto gambling. Q: What are the future plans for CryptoGamble.Tips? Our future plans are to focus on and create a bridge between the casinos from web2.0 to web 3.0. That means recreating the standards of comparison websites for casinos in the crypto space. We will keep our central core of casino reviews and what surrounds them, which include exclusive offers, streaming, slot reviews, game guides, casino tips, and more. Also, as said in a previous article regarding the future of our market, crypto and gambling will keep on growing and we are making sure to be top of mind for future and current users. These are our plans for the future as a company and as a brand. In another interview on Sigma Cosmin shares his initial thoughts on how he launched and started his journey in the business.
