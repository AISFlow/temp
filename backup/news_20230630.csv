14367676,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540611,1688166052,"Here’s What Caused Bitcoin’s Flash Crash To $29,000","Bitcoin had been trending over $31,000 for the better part of Friday after reclaiming this support level from the bears. However, this did not last long as the digital asset saw a flash crash that sent its price spiraling toward the $29,000 level. SEC Says ETF Filings Are Inadequate On Friday, the Wall Street Journal released a report that negatively impacted the market. The report revealed that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission thought that the recent barrage of Bitcoin ETH filings that it had received was inadequate in their filings. Related Reading: Litecoin Bull Case Grows Stronger As Hashrate Touches New All Time-High This follows a two-week stretch of positivity after heavy hitters such as BlackRock, WisdomTree, and Fidelity, among others, filed requests for Bitcoin Spot ETFs with the SEC. Following the news of the filings, the price of Bitcoin rallied tremendously, crossing $31,000 for the first time in over one month. However, with the news of the SEC saying that the filings are inadequate, it has quickly eroded investor sentiment. The price of BTC fell to $29,200 on Friday afternoon, before recovering quickly. Although the damage was already done and BTC bulls are now struggling to maintain support at $30,000. Bitcoin In Freefall Bitcoin had been able to establish a reasonably bullish trend over the last couple of weeks. But that did not last long as the SEC came to burst the bubble for investors. As a result, Bitcoin seems to be in freefall with no reasonable support to keep the price from falling lower. BTC struggles to hold $30,000 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com In a matter of hours, the digital asset has lost about $1,000 of its value, turning a previously good day into a bloody day for investors. This rapid decline has shoved the cryptocurrency below its 5-day moving average, which could see BTC become bearish over the weekend. However, in the mid and long-term, the digital asset remains as bullish as ever, ranging above both its 50-day and 100-day moving averages. Both of these levels signal that while bears may have gained temporary control of the price, bulls remain largely in control. And as long as sell pressure remains low, then BTC could recover back above $31,000 over the next couple of days.

42393219,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgdukR,1688162145,Azuki Is Rebuilding After Its Elementals Mint Mishap,"This week, anime-inspired NFT brand Azuki released a new collection of 20,000 NFT characters that look nearly indistinguishable from the original Azuki collection. The floor price of the project tanked and now Azuki is taking steps to correct its mistakes.  Meanwhile, digital collectibles company Candy Digital is merging with Palm NFT Studio, bringing together industry connections to expand licensed NFT projects across sports, entertainment, art and culture.  You’re reading The Airdrop, our weekly newsletter where we discuss the biggest stories across Web3. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.  This Week's Alpha  Elemental L: This week, blue-chip NFT collection Azuki released the latest expansion to its Azuki universe. Called Elementals, the 20,000-edition NFT collection was teased to heavy fanfare and created a frenzy online when details about the mint were announced. Ten thousand NFTs had been airdropped to attendees at a Las Vegas event, while the other 10,000 were going to be sold via a Dutch auction with specific mint mechanics – Azuki holders were scheduled to have a 10-minute presale window, followed by a 10-minute presale window for holders of BEANZ, Azuki’s derivative companion project. The project sold out within 15 minutes, eliminating the need for a public sale. The mint appeared to be a success, and the project mint raked in $38 million. But the backlash from holders was swift, creating a downward spiral that quickly tanked the project’s floor price and contributed to a mass selloff of other Azuki collections:  Minting mishap: Some Azuki holders complained that they experienced technical issues, and despite queuing up, were unable to mint any NFTs. Others were disappointed that Azuki holders were able to get a head start, essentially shrinking the pool of available NFTs. Co-founder Location TBA said that Azuki holders minted 7,600 NFTs, while BEANZ holders got to mint the remaining 2,400.  Identical art: Holders were also upset that the Elementals artwork was virtually indiscernible from the original Azuki collection, fueling rumors of dilution through increased supply.  Future plans: Azuki apologized and has outlined new ways it plans to revamp the Elementals project. Overall, the mint showed that NFT projects are struggling to innovate during the bear market, and their missteps have widespread consequences across the NFT market.  Sweet like candy: Candy Digital, a digital collectibles company backed by Michael Novogratz’ digital asset firm Galaxy Digital and entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk, has merged with Web3 production firm Palm NFT Studio, creating a powerhouse NFT creative studio under the Candy Digital name. Palm NFT Studio previously received funding from Microsoft's venture fund M12 and Warner Bros.  Creative license: The two firms will work together to create digital experiences for sports franchises like Major League Baseball, NASCAR and WWE, as well as entertainment giants such as Netflix and Warner Bros Discovery.  Blockchain beats: Global entertainment company Warner Music Group (WMG) is teaming up with Polygon Labs to launch a music accelerator program aimed at onboarding the next generation of musicians into Web3. According to a press release, the ideal applicants for the program are ""companies and entrepreneurs operating at the intersection of music, technology and Web3.""  Industry innovation: According to the press release, candidates should focus on “fostering artist-fan communities, establishing decentralized music production and distribution systems, innovating ticketing solutions, exploring music-related merchandise and digital/physical collectibles and integrating music with interactive technology and gaming.”  Real rewards: The chosen projects will receive funding from both WMG and Polygon Labs and will also be eligible for mentorship and networking opportunities from experts across the music and blockchain industries.  Projects on the Rise  Themes and Variations  Who: Vera Molnár via Sotheby’s  What: Generative artist Vera Molnár, who is credited by many scholars as the first female digital artist, is releasing her first-and-only on-chain generative art project through art auction house Sotheby’s. Her work, which began integrating computer art in the 1960s, is regularly cited as an influence for modern generative artists such as Dmitri Cherniak and Tyler Hobbs. The 500-edition collection, formulated around three letters that have heavily influenced digital art, is a reflection of her career and how the practice has changed with the integration of NFTs.  How: The collection kicks off Sotheby’s Gen Art Program, which honors generative artwork and will highlight two to three artists per year. On July 26, the fully on-chain sale will be sold via a Dutch auction format for the first time in the art auction house's 300-year history. Bids will begin at 20 ETH and will be incrementally reduced until the item is bought with one bid.

Proof-of-work: Digital community platform Coordinape is rolling out a soulbound NFT that tracks a holder’s work history within digitally-native organizations.  Bye-bye, MetaBirkins: A federal judge has permanently banned Mason Rothschild from using the MetaBirkin brand, closing out a lengthy court battle.

42393205,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgdtad,1688160580,Court Orders Kraken to Turn Over History Transaction and Account Information to IRS,"A federal court ordered crypto exchange Kraken to turn over account and transaction information to the IRS, which said it needed that information to see if any of the exchange's users had underreported their taxes.  The IRS filed a court petition in the Northern District of California in February, moments after the crypto exchange settled charges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleging that its staking service violated securities law. The tax enforcer alleged that it had issued a summons to Kraken in 2021 that the exchange failed to comply with, and was trying to check for tax liabilities for users who transacted in crypto between 2016 and 2020.  According to Friday's order, Kraken must turn over information for users who transacted with more than $20,000 over the course of a calendar year for that year, including the user's name (and any pseudonyms), birthdate, taxpayer identification number, address, phone number, email address and a host of other documents.  Kraken will also have to provide blockchain addresses and transaction hashes that's already part of transaction data it can share, and it may produce raw data for the IRS.  Judge Joseph Spero, who oversaw the case, appears to have rejected the IRS' effort to also receive employment information and source of wealth from Kraken. The judge denied several of the IRS' requests outright.  ""The Court must determine whether the Government’s summons is narrowly tailored, that is, whether it is 'no broader than necessary to achieve its purpose,'"" the judge wrote in his analysis of some of the IRS's requests. ""The Court finds that to the extent the first three requests are aimed at establishing the identities of the Kraken account holders who fall within the Doe definition, the information sought in these requests is much broader than what is necessary to achieve that purpose for the vast majority of Doe users.""  Kraken was standing up for its customers, the company said.  ""We fought the IRS because they sought intrusive and unnecessary information about U.S. clients, including IP addresses, employment information, sources of wealth, net worth, and banking details,"" a spokesperson from Kraken said in a statement. ""We appreciate that the Court rejected all these demands, recognizing that the IRS requests were 'much broader than what is necessary.'""  Jesse Hamilton contributed reporting.

This can be attributed to investors' preference for Bitcoin over tech, possibly due to Bitcoin's limited supply and its creation to address limitations in the financial system. Despite scandals and tighter regulatory scrutiny in the crypto industry, more adoption by Wall Street's big investment banks has led to a rally in the VanEck fund's share price. Major financial institutions in the U.S. are actively engaged in efforts to facilitate access to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for their investors. Despite the current enthusiasm for crypto, investors should take a wait-and-see position due to potential volatility and the lack of a strong engine of growth comparable to Generative AI for tech. Normally when you talk about digital transformation, names like the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLK ) come to mind, which has profited from the Generative AI catalyst since the beginning of this year to gain 37%. However, as per the blue chart below, it is the VanEck Digital Transformation ETF ( DAPP ) that holds Bitcoin (BTC-USD)-related assets which outperformed tech by more than 100%, tellingly, in a period where Sam Bankman -Fried of FTX (FTT-USD) crypto platform made headlines as regulators pounced in hard. Data by YCharts Thus, investors' preference for Bitcoin over tech may seem abnormal and it is precisely the objective to uncover the underlying reasons, with the ultimate intention being to assess whether investing in the VanEck fund makes sense at this stage. For this purpose, reminding investors that for sustainable capital gains to be made, an investment has to serve an economic purpose, I compare the value creation in tech and crypto. Comparing Value Creation for Tech and Crypto First, Generative AI brings real benefits as seen by the speed with which one can generate reports with ChatGPT. Thus, by using simple-to-use natural language interactions instead of complex computer codes as in previous generations of machine language, this new AI flavor glitters by its simplicity while its underlying algorithms skim through the tons of data comprising the internet to extract valuable insights. In this way, it enables a high level of automation which in turn bring tangible productivity gains which can result in up to $4.4 trillion of economic benefits annually according to research firm McKinsey. In comparison, Bitcoin which was designed as a peer-to-peer payment network in response to the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-2009 was more “anti-establishment” in the sense that the aim was to do away with the financial system prevailing at that time, mostly revolving around the U.S central bank’s printing a lot of dollar notes thereby devaluing the currency. Going deeper, with its decentralized nature, the digital asset was created to solve some of the problems inherent in our banking system, so that governments could not bring changes to supply as with bank notes. As such, the number of Bitcoins as of today is 19,415,287.5 with 1,584,712.5 remaining to be mined, or created as software codes using blockchain technology. This limited supply or scarcity factor and the fact that Bitcoin was created to address limitations in the financial system may be the two reasons why DAPP did see a lot of inflows at the beginning of March this year coinciding with the turmoil impacting U.S. regional banks. Looking at portfolio protection at times of crisis, its performance even exceeded precious metals, in this case, the SPDR Gold Shares ( GLD ) as per the chart below. Thus, Bitcoin can be perceived as a safe haven asset class as I detailed in a thesis about the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ). Data by YCharts Except for that bright spot, there was no Generative AI-type of catalysts for crypto, but, on the contrary, the industry was shaken up by scandals and tighter regulatory scrutiny. It all started in November last year when Sam Bankman-Fried the CEO of FTX, was arrested after the collapse of his cryptocurrency exchange platform. At that time, the value of BTC plummeted by around 20% in only a few days. The worst was to come with other platforms like lender Genesis going down due to the contagion effect from FTX which held some of its cryptos in its custody. This is like the domino effect seen in a systemic crisis impacting stock markets as other platforms including Celsius and Voyager were plagued. DAPP's Holdings and Big Institutions' Enthusiasm for Crypto As for Coinbase, ( COIN ) which is the second largest exchange in the crypto ecosystem and also DAPP’s largest holding as pictured below, it was sued by the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) on June 6, on grounds that its asset trading platform was not properly registered. However, it is fighting back by claiming that the assets it trades do not constitute investment contracts or securities. Largest Holdings (www.vaneck.com) Consequently, the platform provider’s stock was hit by volatility, but, subsequently, the downside was quickly overwhelmed by more people pouring money into digital assets inducing a rally in DAPP's share price as per the above chart. Looking for the reason, it is thanks to more adoption by Wall Street's big investment banks. In this respect, BlackRock's (BLK) mid-June filing aimed at launching a Bitcoin ETF generated a lot of attention. Furthermore, it is not alone as many major financial institutions in the U.S. are actively engaged in efforts to facilitate access to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for their investors. Mind-blowingly, these institutions collectively manage an impressive $27 trillion in client assets. Table Built using Data from (cointelegraph.com) Looking in the rear mirror, initially disdained by Wall Street which was horrified at the prospect of Bitcoin becoming embedded in the mainstream financial and governmental systems, it seems that a whole different picture is emerging as seen by the interest of the top eight financial institutions. This interest comes on top of existing funds like the iShares Blockchain and Tech ETF ( IBLC ) as well as the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF ( SATO ) as shown below . Volatility and Lacking a Powerful Engine of Growth However, together with BITO, these two are all classified as alternative funds, meaning that they are SEC-registered but hold "" non-traditional investments or with complex trading strategies”. As such, they are flagged as having unique characteristics and are potentially riskier because they may make use of leverage. Comparison of funds (seekingalpha.com) It is precisely to remove these complexities that BlackRock has designed its spot Bitcoin ETF to be traded as a Commodity-Based Trust Share with Coinbase acting as the custodian of Bitcoin holdings and the Bank of New York Mellon ( BK ) for the fiat currency part. Moreover, in BlackRock's proposed ETF, there can be a direct trade between two market participants (one buying and the other selling), whereas, for those trading futures contracts like BITO, the action takes place in the derivatives market. Detailing further, BITO's underlying fund holds CME futures and is regulated by the CFTC or Commodities Futures Trading Commission in the same way as a commodity such as corn or palm oil. In case BlackRock's filing is approved it would constitute the first one of its kind by the SEC, but, given that previous applications namely by Grayscale and ARK Investments have not been successful, there are risks that the BlackRock application is rejected too, implying volatility for DAPP as well. Thus, after an above-140% YTD upside, it is better to adopt a wait-and-see approach for the time being and, also expect some downside as a dose of realism gets injected into the system. This could take the form of heated debates between Coinbase and the SEC as part of court hearings. To further justify my position that there is a low probability of the upside continuing, the crypto world does not have an engine of growth comparable in strength to Generative AI for tech. Not the Right Time Still, more institutional support for cryptocurrencies which is also exemplified by Fidelity boosting up its Digital Assets Division to provide clients with more crypto exposure shows that the demand factor is well present. Also, unlike funds holdings futures, DAPP holds crypto exchanges, miners, and FinTech companies like Block ( SQ ) as well as MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) which holds a substantial amount of digital assets in its balance sheet. For this purpose, the ETF tracks the MVIS Global Digital Assets Equity Index. Therefore, for those looking for exposure to the crypto world, the relatively new DAPP, incepted in April 2021, with an AUM of $45.24 million and an expense ratio of 0.5% represents an appropriate choice, but not at the current share price. A better margin of entry would be around $5.9, attained before BlackRock's filing, and a level which has constituted a resistance level as represented by the blue line below. This price takes into consideration Bitcoin's value as a safe haven alongside gold for periods of uncertainty impacting the conventional banking system. www.seekingalpha.com In conclusion, this thesis has shown that unless you were an early investor who has already harvested incredible returns and is holding shares of DAPP, it is not time to invest as most of the market moves have been driven by institutions betting on the SEC for approval of their crypto strategy, or speculation, not concrete ingredients like Generative AI for tech. Finally, as seen during the banking turmoil, crypto could thrive again during economic uncertainty, but this will depend on liquidity flowing through the systems for digital assets to be exchanged into dollars or vice versa.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4614693-dapp-crypto-upside-unsustainable-when-compared-to-tech?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14365223.jpeg

42393216,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgduPv,1688159663,Harry Styles Concert App Takes Fans in More Than One Direction With Blockchain Rewards,"Non-fungible token (NFT) rewards are often seen as a sign of the times, transforming the relationship between artists and fans and creating a fine line between physical and digital experiences.  Earlier this month, British pop star and former One Direction band member Harry Styles played a show at Slade Castle in Ireland. Fans were invited to use EVNTZ, the official event app for the concert, and were able to open up a self-custodial digital wallet that can house future blockchain-based rewards. The app linked up with Co:Create, a Web3 infrastructure company, and powered the experience via its API that connects through Polygon, a well-known Ethereum sidechain.  Kim O’Callaghan, founder of EVNTZ, told CoinDesk that 5,000 of the 80,000 fans in attendance claimed wallets through the app, which garnered over 100,000 unique interactions.  According to O’Callaghan, the app serves as a one-stop service for fans that attended the concert. Through it, they were able to book transportation, post photos to social media and access merch. She teased plans for future in-app rewards linked to engagement within the fan community.  ""The EVNTZ team is exploring a range of reward features powered by Web3, designed to empower the next generation of music fans,"" she said. ""Our goal is to meet the growing expectation of fans who genuinely deserve better experiences in return for their loyalty.""  The app, which O’Callaghan said plans to offer experiences for other artists in 2024, was designed to be a seamless entry point into blockchain technology without the need for prior experience. Through its user interface, brands can deliver rich experiences ""without understanding Web3 or how to deploy smart contracts,"" said O’Callaghan. ""From the fan’s perspective, the Web3 elements, such as spinning up a wallet, seed phrases and paying gas fees, are all kept under the hood – offering an optimized user experience.""  In O’Callaghan's opinion, the events industry creates a disconnect for fans and doesn’t inherently reward fans for their dedication to a particular artist. She explained that blockchain-based rewards and experiences can help pave new pathways for artists and fans.  ""By leveraging Web3, we can power community loyalty, enabling the creation of entertaining and gamified experiences that offer fans self-owned rewards,"" she said. ""Fans can now be recognized and rewarded for their dedication and engagement with their favorite artists, and everything they do at a show can be part of an integrated, gamified, and cohesive experience.""  Tara Fung, CEO of Co:Create, told CoinDesk that offering these experiences on-chain allows for transparency and an easier route for brands to connect with fans. She also noted that fans can use blockchain tools to influence the direction of their favorite brands and get rewarded for doing so.  “Blockchain allows for you to see who else is a part of and who else is participating in similar experiences to be rewarded for things that have happened at a specific moment, before that moment, or after that moment in real life or online,” said Fung. “At Co:Create, it's all about finding these builders who are creating these incredible experiences for communities and really focused on community-driven brands and helping them bring their vision to life.”  As Web3 critics have been grappling to define NFT utility, blockchain-based ticketing, loyalty and memberships have been on the rise. In March, Polygon teamed up with customer relation management (CRM) Salesforce to help clients create Web3 loyalty programs. In June, chef and television personality Guy Fieri and Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Sammy Hagar created a loyalty program for their liquor brand Santo Spirits, leveraging NFTs to reward their customers with physical items and experiences.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/06/30/harry-styles-concert-app-takes-fans-in-more-than-one-direction-with-blockchain-rewards,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe52d86f8c020a345c7724fc705dff9af9b50af3-2154x1538.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Fidelity, WisdomTree, VanEck, ARK Invest, Galaxy/Invesco and BlackRock all filed for spot bitcoin ETFs over the past few weeks, hoping to succeed at launching a product the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected for years. While BlackRock filed with Nasdaq, the other companies are working with Cboe.  On Friday, the SEC told some both Nasdaq and Cboe that their applications were ""inadequate"" because they didn't name the market that the fund sponsors are working with on their surveillance-sharing agreements, according to the Wall Street Journal.  In its refiled applications, Cboe said Coinbase's platform ""represents a substantial portion of U.S.-based and USD denominated Bitcoin trading"" as it named the U.S. crypto exchange as its partner for these surveillance-sharing agreements.  ""The Spot BTC SSA [surveillance-sharing agreement] is expected to have the hallmarks of a surveillance-sharing agreement between two members of the ISG, which would give the Exchange supplemental access to data regarding spot Bitcoin trades occurring on Coinbase if the Exchange determines it is necessary as part of its surveillance program for the Commodity-Based Trust Shares in a manner similar to the way that exchanges share information as part of ISG,"" the filing said.  Read more: Bitcoin Tumbles on Report of SEC Saying Spot BTC ETF Filings Inadequate  The SEC has called for surveillance-sharing agreements with markets of ""significant size"" in the past, arguing that this is necessary to prevent market manipulation or other unwanted behaviors and protect consumers. The lack of these agreements figured heavily into many of the SEC's prior rejections of bitcoin ETF applications.  The regulator still has to formally acknowledge it is reviewing the applications. The SEC will kick off an initial 45-day review period when it publishes the filings in the Federal Register – the national logbook – but can extend this to a total of 240 days.  Complicating the SEC's calculus may be the fact that it sued Coinbase earlier this month on allegations of operating an unregistered securities exchange, broker and clearinghouse – though the SEC is not alleging that Bitcoin itself is a security, and SEC Chair Gary Gensler has often referred to it as an example of a digital asset that is not a security.  It also remains to be seen whether the SEC will agree that Coinbase is a significant, regulated market for bitcoin.

Azuki this week released its latest 20,000-edition NFT collection titled “Elementals,” which promptly sold out in 15 minutes and brought in $38 million. But backlash was swift from several collectors who were unable to mint the NFTs due to technical issues and a condensed minting window. Soon after, Azuki released the artwork for the collection, which holders claimed was virtually indistinguishable from the original collection and fueled rumors of dilution through increased supply. Within hours, the original Azuki collection’s floor price slid 44%.  Pseudonymous Azuki holder Arcanic posted a Twitter thread on Thursday detailing what was discussed on a private call between the Azuki team and its community. According to Arcanic, Azuki’s pseudonymous co-founder Zagabond and other “core” team members provided clarity on the project’s next steps.  “The team wanted to capture the same feeling that people got when browsing through the OG Azuki collection. ‘Give them more of what they love.’ This was their intent, but they missed the mark here,” Arcanic wrote in a tweet.  The Azuki team noted its plans to update the artwork of the Elementals collection to further distinguish it from the original collection. Arcanic shared leaked artwork by Arnold Tsang, the co-creator of Azuki, which featured different backgrounds.  Azuki previously teased that it was working on an anime series featuring its character universe. According to Arcanic, the Azuki team expanded on its plans during the community call, saying that the show will consist of animated shorts that will be self-funded and incorporate Web3 technologies. The team also noted that the Green Bean recently airdropped to Azuki holders will also play a part in the series.  ""Imagine watching an anime, and afterward you can interact with an NPC in the anime, whether that's via Twitter or a web app, and the NPC can issue you tokens with which you can interact,” said Zagabond on the call.  Azuki is also working on other ways to reward its holders, such as denoting “collector status” for long-term holders and those who own tokens with rare traits, Arcanic wrote.  Arcanic told CoinDesk that while he was frustrated with the Elementals mint and artwork reveal, he’s optimistic about the future of Azuki and how the project will learn from its mistakes.  “The team has proven to be extremely competent and passionate,” said Arcanic. “So long as they remain aligned with their core community from here on out, I believe they can begin to regain the trust of the broader community once more.”  At the time of writing, Azuki Elementals’ floor price was 1.29 ETH, about $2,480, with a trading volume of about 11,930 ETH, or just under $23 million, according to OpenSea.

14362990,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540625,1688155245,"Compound (COMP) Blasts Off With 113% Rise In Two-Week Rally, What’s Behind The Surge?","Compound (COMP) has recently surged with a staggering 113% rise in just two weeks, and the reason behind the rally has been the talk of the crypto community. DeFi Ignas, a decentralized finance (DeFi) researcher, has analyzed the recent developments surrounding Compound and provided insights into the potential factors contributing to the surge. Compound Takes The Lead With Triple-Digit Growth In June This remarkable growth has been fueled by a range of factors, including the recent announcement of the launch of Superstate Funds by Compound’s founder, which aims to bridge traditional markets with blockchain ecosystems. One of the major challenges facing DeFi is the lack of integration with traditional financial markets. While the DeFi space has grown rapidly over the past few years, it is still relatively small compared to the traditional financial system. Related Reading: XRP Dips After SEC’s ETF Blow But A Rebound Looks Likely By bridging these two worlds, Superstate could help to bring more institutional investors into the DeFi space and increase the overall liquidity and stability of DeFi protocols. Furthermore, Superstate’s focus on creating regulated financial products could help address some of the regulatory concerns raised about DeFi. While DeFi protocols are decentralized and operate on blockchain networks, they still fall under the jurisdiction of various regulatory bodies. By creating regulated financial products that comply with existing regulations, Superstate could help to mitigate some of the risks associated with DeFi and pave the way for more widespread adoption of these protocols. Superstate aims to bridge traditional markets with blockchain ecosystems by buying short-term government debt and tokenizing it on blockchains. While it is unclear whether the tokenization will include COMP holders or lead to an airdrop, this announcement has generated excitement and speculation among the crypto community. Jump Crypto Whale Responsible For COMP Rally? While new governance proposals have been introduced, none have been significant enough to account for the sudden price increase. However, there has been a significant balance change among various Jump Crypto wallets. Jump Crypto wallets are a group of cryptocurrency wallets associated with Jump Trading, a Chicago-based trading firm specializing in high-frequency trading strategies. The wallets have been identified as significant players in the cryptocurrency market, particularly in the DeFi space, where they have been involved in market making and liquidity provision. These wallets have emerged as major players in the COMP market. One of these wallets holds many COMP tokens and has been involved in significant balance changes, including the recent withdrawal of 170,000 COMP tokens from Binance. This withdrawal amounts to $9.7 million and represents 1.7% of the total supply of COMP. Related Reading: OKX Liquid Marketplace Records Over $3 Billion In Institutional Trade Volume The actions of this particular wallet appear to be the primary reason for the recent surge in the COMP price. The withdrawal of such a large amount of tokens from Binance has significantly increased demand for COMP, driving up its price. As a result, this wallet now ranks as the ninth-largest holder of COMP tokens. Compound’s native token, COMP, is trading at $58, following its uptrend that began on June 16th. In the last 24 hours, COMP has continued to soar with a 14% gain and is currently attempting to break through the $60 level to surpass its yearly high of $64 achieved in February.

BTC and ETH make up over 97% of the fund's assets. If we adjust the GDLC share discount to match the discounts in GBTC and ETHE, GDLC shares should be closer to $11. When I last covered the Grayscale Digital Large Cap fund ( GDLC ) in August 2022, I was not impressed with the fund or the methodology used to determine asset inclusion for fund holdings. My thinking was a large-cap diversified fund should have exposure to more than just 5 assets and the weighting of those exposures shouldn't lean so heavily to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). Each of which has their own Grayscale funds and gets the lion's share of crypto investment fund flow. Since that article, very little has changed in that regard. GDLC is still a very poorly diversified crypto investment fund with just 5 assets under management. I still think the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ( BITW ) is probably a better option for investors who want exposure to multiple crypto assets in one ticker. However, I've actually flipped my stance on GDLC since that article. The performance of the fund has become so bad that it actually might be a good buy now, in my view. The Spot ETF Tailwind Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( BTC )"" target=""_blank"">GBTC ) is by far the most well-known fund that the company manages, and for good reason. It's the largest Grayscale fund by AUM, with $19 billion in BTC. GBTC is now notorious for serving as an arbitrage trade for investors who are comfortable with indirect exposure to Bitcoin as the fund has traded well below net asset value for over a year: Data by YCharts GBTC isn't alone in that regard. With the exception of the smaller illiquid funds, almost all of Grayscale's crypto investment funds trade at a sizeable discount to NAV. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ) is now trading at a nearly 45% discount, even as the NAV discount in GBTC has closed to under 30%. To address this NAV discount problem, Grayscale has tried to convert GBTC to a spot ETF, though the US Securities and Exchange Commission has denied every spot BTC application to this point. A large driver of GBTC's NAV discount tightening over the last couple of weeks has been in response to BlackRock's ( BLK ) spot bitcoin ETF application. This is a positive catalyst that I pointed out shortly after BlackRock's application. Despite the June 30th news that the SEC believes the recent flood of spot bitcoin ETFs is ""inadequate,"" there is actually some interesting language beyond the headlines. According to CoinDesk : At issue, the story continued, is that the filings didn't have enough detail with respect to the ""surveillance-sharing agreements,"" including which spot bitcoin exchange would be used. The asset managers can update their applications and refile, and the CBOE indicated to the WSJ that it plans to do so. This would seem to suggest that the $1,500 intraday selloff in BTC following the SEC news could have been an overreaction. I suspect most or all of these spot BTC applications will be updated and refilled. And I maintain that the renewed interest in spot BTC ETFs is likely a very positive sign for GBTC. Arb of An Arb? This brings us to the arbitrage trade potential presently available in the GDLC shares. As I stated earlier, I believe Grayscale's large-cap fund has failed to deliver on providing traditional investors a diversified crypto asset fund. While the fund still has 5 assets under management, exposure to the bottom 3 altcoins has collapsed down to just 2.6% of the fund: GDLC Components (Grayscale) Bitcoin and Ethereum now make up over 97% of the assets in the fund, and the shares are trading at a 50% discount to NAV: GDLC (Grayscale/Author Chart) While 50% isn't the lowest the discount in GDLC shares has ever been, it does still potentially provide an interesting arbitrage opportunity since such a large amount of the fund is made up of BTC and ETH. The current fund shares have over 70% exposure to BTC and 27% to ETH. If we weigh those holdings to match the discount rates in GBTC and ETHE, the GDLC shares are dramatically underpriced at $8.55: GDLC Assets AUM Discount Adjustment Asset Value BTC $186,943,360 29.3% $132,168,955 ETH $72,978,401 44.8% $40,284,077 Adjusted Discount Market Cap $172,453,033 Adjusted share price $10.87 Source: Author Calculations based on Grayscale AUM and outstanding share data In the table above, I'm making an assumption of a $30,000 BTC price and a $1,850 ETH price. I'm also completely zeroing out the altcoins under management entirely, since they're such a small portion of the fund anyway. We still get a share price value off $10.87 when we discount the BTC by the same rate GBTC is discounted and the ETH by the same rate ETHE is discounted. I'll also point out that Grayscale has a single asset Solana fund ( SOL )"" target=""_blank"">GSOL ) that actually trades at a sizeable premium because the fund is so illiquid. Given that, zeroing out the altcoins in GDLC could be argued to be overly conservative in building a revaluation estimate. Risks There is quite a bit of volatility with crypto and by extension the Grayscale funds. What adds to that volatility is the fact that the funds can often underperform and overperform the assets under management. Even if the discount closes, it doesn't necessarily mean the share price of the funds will appreciate. Furthermore, some of these Grayscale funds have high degrees of related party ownership. Those related parties include Digital Currency Group, Genesis, Grayscale, and CoinDesk. In recent filings, we've seen selling from those related parties and GDLC has been one of the funds that has been sold: Grayscale Trusts Last Reporting Period Current Reporting Period Change Related Party Ownership GBTC 36,065,470 36,066,527 0.0% 5.2% ETHE 11,811,797 8,728,797 -26.1% 2.8% Litecoin ( LTCN ) 1,296,956 1,126,498 -13.1% 6.6% Bitcoin Cash ( BCHG ) 1,786,273 1,443,441 -19.2% 4.2% GDLC 1,370,846 1,213,437 -11.5% 7.6% Source: Grayscale Furthermore, at 1.2 million shares still held by related parties and just under 15.9 million GDLC shares outstanding, there is a somewhat high concentration of related party ownership in GDLC compared to the other large Grayscale funds. And some of these related parties have been in the news in recent months for being financially distressed. Investor Takeaway This is a very simple thesis. GDLC has performed so badly as a diversified crypto fund that it's now arguably a good arbitrage trade, given how undervalued the shares are compared to other Grayscale fund shares that are holding the same assets. What could hinder this arbitrage trade would be the discounts of the other Grayscale funds moving back lower again, and that's certainly a possibility. Something else to consider would be the potential for Grayscale to adjust holding methodology to increase exposure to altcoins from the current 2.6% level. All that said, I like GDLC for a small speculative trade down here.",NEUTRAL,BCH | ETH,ALTCOIN | BCH | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4614666-grayscale-digital-large-cap-a-potential-arbitrage-opportunity?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14361499.jpeg

This upward movement has provided a bullish boost and allowed the altcoin to register gains in recent trading sessions. However, despite this bullishness, the price of LTC remains within bearish territory, indicating ongoing downward pressure. Reclaiming the $100 price mark is crucial for sustaining a bullish trend. Related Reading: XRP Dips After SEC’s ETF Blow But A Rebound Looks Likely In the past 24 hours, LTC has experienced a rally of nearly 17%. On the weekly chart, the altcoin has maintained double-digit gains, reflecting its positive performance over a longer period. It’s worth noting that Litecoin’s halving event is just a little over a month away. Historically, the price of the asset tends to increase before this event. However, due to the fluctuating nature of Bitcoin, which often influences major altcoins, LTC might experience slight depreciation. Significant depreciation is less likely as long as LTC maintains its price above the local support level. A sustained increase in demand for the altcoin is necessary to ensure continued gains on the daily chart. The market capitalization of LTC has also increased, indicating bullish momentum in the market. Litecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart When writing, Litecoin (LTC) was trading at $97.81. After reaching the $100 mark, LTC has been steadily gaining in price. However, despite the bullish momentum, Litecoin remains within a crucial zone that is bearish and could potentially reverse the gains. This bearish zone, indicated in red, extends from $94 to $103. In previous trading sessions, LTC has retraced when attempting to revisit the $103 level. The $94 mark has also been a reversal point over the past few months. Moreover, Litecoin entered the excess selling zone the maximum number of times, where the price fluctuated between the two (upper and lower) bands of the bearish region. The overhead resistance levels are $100 and $103. In case of a decline from these levels, the price could drop to $94 initially, followed by a potential further decline to $90. Technical Analysis Regarding demand, Litecoin (LTC) was approaching overbought conditions. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was above the 60 mark, indicating buyers had gained market control. This suggests a higher demand for LTC compared to selling pressure. The increased demand was also reflected in the price, as it climbed above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line. This signifies that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market, pushing it higher. As long as Litecoin (LTC) maintains its price above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA), indicated by the red line on the chart, specifically around the $87 level, the bullish sentiment is expected to persist. Litecoin (LTC) formed a strong buy signal in line with increased demand. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator showed a green histogram, indicating a fresh buy signal. This suggests a strong bullish momentum and strength in the LTC market. Related Reading: Litecoin Up 18% In Past 24 Hours, Is Halving Rally Here?

42410260,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcwfST,1688149815,Crypto Miner Hive Blockchain Touts Privacy of AI Models Running on Its GPUs,"Bitcoin mining firm Hive Blockchain (HIVE) aims to allow customers to train large language AI models in its data centers, touting better privacy compared to rivals such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, the firm said on an earnings call with analysts on Friday.  ""Companies now are mindful that they don't want to upload sensitive client data to a company like OpenAI that has a public LLM [large language model]. What we aspire to offer at Hive through Hive Cloud is privacy where companies can have a service agreement in place, ownership of their data and privacy and still run AI [artificial intelligence] compute workloads on our bank of GPUs [graphics processing units],"" said Aydin Kilic, CEO and President of the mining firm.  Hive's shares on the Nasdaq gained almost 2% on Friday.  Miners have been increasingly pivoting to AI as mining economics have interfered with their profitability, with some facing bankruptcies, while the AI sector sees a boom in interest from investors. However, it is yet to be determined whether miners can compete with big tech firms such as Google and Amazon Web Services who benefit from both economies of scale and decades of experience running high-quality customer-facing data centers.  Large language models understand and generate human language using probabilistic calculations. They are often trained on graphics processing units, a type of electronic circuit made up of semiconductors that was originally used for image processing, but has been found to be good at running AI loads.

Some of those it has directed to mining altcoins, while others are available to rent as a service or deployed in its cloud offering.  The firm expects a run-rate of $1 million annually for its GPUs, it said on the earnings call. Already ""500 GPU cards generated $230,000 revenue this quarter,” said the firm's Chairman, Frank Holmes, in a press release discussing the annual and quarterly earnings. Hive's fiscal year ended on March 31, 2023.  Hive reported $106.3 million in revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, with a gross operating margin of $50.4 million, or 47% of revenue. That's about half of the historic revenue it noted in FY2022 of $211.2 million at a gross operating margin of 78% of revenue.  Overall in FY2023, the firm reported a net loss of $236.4 million, which it noted included several non-cash charges, such as $81.7 million of depreciation, an impairment to equipment of $70.4 million and an impairment to deposits of $27.3 million.

According to court documents from last December, Celsius controlled 90 million MATIC, 103 million ADA, 161,000 SOL, 3.3 million LINK, 1.8 million polkadot (DOT), 200,000 litecoin (LTC) and 106,000 AAVE on November 25, 2022.

14359907,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540607,1688148026,Bitcoin Price Takes A Hit As SEC Deems Spot ETF Filings ‘Inadequate’,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reportedly told exchanges Nasdaq and Cboe that recent filings for spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from asset managers including BlackRock and Fidelity were not “clear and comprehensive” enough. Bitcoin ETFs In Jeopardy? The SEC has rejected several Bitcoin ETF filings in recent years due to concerns over potential fraudulent and manipulative practices associated with the cryptocurrency market. The agency has stated that the filings do not meet the standards designed to protect investors and the public interest. In particular, the SEC has expressed concerns about the lack of regulation and oversight in the cryptocurrency market, which could make it easier for bad actors to manipulate the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Litecoin Up 18% In Past 24 Hours, Is Halving Rally Here? The SEC has also expressed concerns about custody and liquidity issues related to cryptocurrency. While some asset managers have attempted to address these concerns in their filings, the SEC has continued to reject them as inadequate. However, Several proposed solutions have been put forward to address the SEC’s concerns around Bitcoin ETFs. One potential solution is the use of regulated custodians to hold the Bitcoin backing the ETF, which would provide greater oversight and security for investors. Some asset managers have also proposed using futures contracts to track the price of Bitcoin, rather than holding the actual cryptocurrency, which could help address liquidity concerns. In addition, some have suggested that the SEC could work with industry participants to establish best practices and guidelines for the cryptocurrency market, which could help mitigate risks associated with fraudulent and manipulative practices. Despite these proposals, the SEC has continued to scrutinize Bitcoin ETF filings, indicating that more work may need to be done to address the agency’s concerns. The SEC declined to comment on the Wall Street Journal report, while Nasdaq and Cboe were not available for immediate comment. The decision is a blow to asset managers’ attempts to launch Bitcoin ETFs, which have been repeatedly blocked by regulators in the US. BTC’s Price Tumbles, Signaling The End Of The Bull Run? The latest criticism by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on filings for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds has caused BTC’s price to drop from over $31,000 to $29,800. Although Bitcoin is currently trading above the $30,000 line, there is uncertainty around the ETF filings by BlackRock and other major financial players, which could lead to another downtrend and a test of lower support. If this were to happen, Bitcoin bulls must hold the $29,500 line, which is the next support below $30,000. Additionally, Bitcoin’s 50-day moving average (MA) on the daily chart could provide strong support for the cryptocurrency, currently placed at $28,100. Related Reading: Ethereum Classic (ETC) Resumes Uptrend, Notches 13% In The Last Day Nevertheless, as reported on June 29th by NewsBTC, Bitcoin is likely to enter a 10-day period of downtrend due to the loss of the strength of the current uptrend, as noted by the Average Directional Index (ADX) on the 1-day chart. The ADX is a technical indicator that measures the strength of a trend and is used by traders to identify potential price movements. Bitcoin’s ADX is already spiking down, which suggests a potential shift in trend. Additionally, the squeeze momentum indicator also reflects the downtrend that Bitcoin could be poised to experience in the coming week and a half. Overall, the recent criticism by the US SEC of the filings for spot BTC ETFs by BlackRock and Fidelity adds to the uncertainty surrounding the cryptocurrency’s future price movements. If the asset managers cannot find common ground with the SEC’s expectations, their ETF applications could be in jeopardy.

42410254,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcwf21,1688145413,How Much Is Too Much to Spend on FTX's Bankruptcy?,"The legal fees for FTX’s bankruptcy process have already topped $200 million, a cost that is likely to grow.  One activist FTX victim is raising questions about those extraordinary costs, which pay for restructuring the allegedly fraudulent crypto exchange, and recovering victim’s funds from a dizzying array of recipients. Those costs are undeniably out of the ordinary, outpacing the cost of other notably complex bankruptcies by a variety of metrics.  That matters because the legal fees ultimately come out of the recovered funds that will be returned to FTX creditors, including retail depositors, at the end of the process.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Defrauded FTX customers are owed $8.7 billion by the exchange, and the recovery of much of the missing money seems increasingly likely. But at the current pace, bankruptcy fees could eat up nearly 10% of what victims are owed.  The high cost of going broke  “The funds which are due to the creditors are being frivolously spent,” argues Sunil Kuvari, a former FTX customer.  Kuvari bases that claim on comparisons to other historical and recent bankruptcies. FTX, he found, is proving far more expensive than comparable proceedings, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of the underlying assets and liabilities.  “I thought, percentage wise, it should be similar to [the cost of unwinding] Celsius,” he says. “But by that metric, [creditors] are being overcharged by $30-$40 million per month.”  Celsius Network claimed $5.5 billion in liabilities at the outset of its bankruptcy, compared to the $8.7 billion FTX now owes its customers. But Celsius’ bankruptcy costs only ran to $87 million after six months. FTX’s costs have already topped $200 million in the same period.  Kuvari is a former finance professional who says he had about $2.1 million in assets on FTX when it collapsed. He is spearheading a class action lawsuit against influencers and celebrities who touted FTX, and has become prominent among creditors. He’s very motivated to scrutinize the bankruptcy spending: the outsized costs of the bankruptcy could mean he loses an extra $100,000 or more.  Kuvari has been ringing alarms about bankruptcy costs following a June 20 report by bankruptcy examiner Katherine Stadler, a lawyer tasked with overseeing the expense of the restructuring. In that report, Stadler recommended some cost reductions, but largely described the outsized costs as appropriate to the complexity of the situation.  If the FTX bankruptcy takes two years – the length of Enron’s bankruptcy – the restructuring team would be on track to bill roughly $800 million at its current pace. Enron’s bankruptcy cost $700 million, or just over $1.1 billion in 2023 dollars.  That would mean FTX’s bankruptcy cost about 3/4ths as much as Enron’s. But among Kuvari’s points is that Enron was nearly 100 times the size of FTX in terms of revenue and employees.  See also: How Sam Bankman-Fried's 'Effective' Altruism Blew Up FTX | Opinion  FTX’s remaining and recovered assets totaled around $7.3 billion as of this month, while Enron’s totaled $110 billion, or nearly $190 billion in 2023 dollars. So Chief Executive John Jay Ray III’s debtor team at FTX is on track to charge around 75% of the Enron fees to untangle 4% as much in the exchange’s assets.  And while management of FTX was notoriously chaotic, Enron’s fraud revolved around comparable complexity: the creation of hundreds of spinoffs, intentionally hard to track and meant to conceal corporate debt, even from Enron's own auditors.  So why is FTX’s unwind costing so much relative to its size – and can those costs be reined in?  ‘Frivolous’ – or just complex?  It’s probably imprecise to project the costs for the first six months of the FTX bankruptcy forward to its conclusion. Stadler’s fee examiner report, while acknowledging that proceedings “appear on track to be very expensive by any measure,” describes the initial phases of the recovery process as particularly chaotic and perhaps wasteful, but for defensible reasons.  “The Bankruptcy Code is explicit that reasonableness and necessity are to be measured at the time services are performed, not in hindsight,” Sadler wrote. “Some [fee] Applicants assembled teams that ended up being too big. Some firms deployed experts whose technical skill did not end up being needed. Others directed resources from other sectors of their organizations to fill gaps in their teams. The Fee Examiner cannot in good faith conclude that any of those approaches was wholly unreasonable in the moment.”  SBF's chaotic approach to disposing of his customers’ money seems to have been improvised rather than strategic.  This rough start implies that future costs will decline as the process rationalizes. Stadler emphasizes that the bankruptcy teams “will continue to refine their processes to identify and eliminate inefficiency and excess as the cases progress.” Creditors will want to watch future reports very closely to make sure that actually happens.  Sadler’s report does also advocate for better controls in specific aspects of the bankruptcy. She found that the bankruptcy teams were using a higher proportion of senior staff than usual, with associated higher costs. Sadler also pushed teams to reduce the number of people in meetings and attending hearings.  Most specifically, Sadler imposed negotiated reductions of 5%-10% in fee requests filed by both the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, and the management consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal, on grounds including “excessive meeting attendance.”  But even after a reduction in its fee requests, comparisons to similar proceedings highlight Alvarez & Marsal specifically as billing more than usual. In fact, A&M are also part of the bankruptcy of another crypto blunder, and it is charging much less in that case.  “Alvarez & Marsal have been charging Celsius $1.7 million per month,” Kuvari found, “And charging FTX $11 million a month.” Similarly to the comparison with Enron, this means A&M is charging about six times as much on a bankruptcy involving only about 50% more liabilities. On a percentage basis, A&M took around 11% of fees in the Celsius bankruptcy, but is getting about 30% of the FTX fees.  A&M is responsible for a variety of tasks, notably including the identification and recovery of assets. This may go a long way to explaining the discrepancy in the fee rates, since former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried seemed determined to give away his customers’ money as fast as possible, whether to family members, his favorite ""charities,"" or complete strangers. Hunting that money down, and fighting to claw it back, seems naturally labor intensive.  See also: Sam Bankman-Fried's Altruism Wasn't Very Effective | Opinion  A&M also helped develop accounting records in the case, and this again appears to be particularly complicated. Sadler described the state of FTX after its collapse as a “smoldering heap of wreckage” with many financial records simply missing. That echoed earlier statements by John Jay Ray III, who described the situation as even worse than Enron’s.  (We have reached out to A&M for comment on the numbers, and will update this story if we hear back from them.)  But Kuvari contests the idea that FTX’s bankruptcy is more complex than Enron’s.  “In fact, when I compared Enron to FTX, it’s like a dot. [FTX is] a company that has operated for three years. It had a maximum of 200 employees, and Enron had 20,000 employees.”  More important than scale, Kuvari argues that Enron’s fraud was just as opaque as FTX’s, and probably moreso.  “Enron had 3,000 off balance-sheet SPEs,” or special purpose entities, Kuvari points out. These entities were specifically created, by veterans of finance, to hide liabilities from auditors and the public. By contrast, Kuvari says, FTX involved “just embezzlement of an exchange. Probably as simple as can be.”  The counterpoint is that while Enron covered its tracks cannily, it did at least keep records of those activities. In fact, some of the documents tracking the creation of Enron SPEs played a role in the criminal prosecution of the ringleaders of that fraud.  Sam Bankman-Fried, it is increasingly clear, was not as smart as many believed, in any even slightly expansive sense of that term. His completely chaotic approach to disposing of his customers’ money seems to have been improvised rather than strategic. And it doesn’t seem to have helped him stay afloat longer than Enron’s puppet masters, who were engaged in fraudulent activity for the better part of a decade before being caught.  But SBF’s apparent ineptitude has certainly made life harder on those left to clean up his mess. While there’s plenty of reason to scrutinize the spending of the FTX bankruptcy team, what’s most clear is that Bankman-Fried himself is taking one last pound of flesh from FTX’s many victims before he faces the music this October.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,David Z.

Bitcoin (BTC) rose above $31,200 early Friday, before quickly plunging to as low as $29,470, CoinDesk Indices data shows, as traders reacted to the news about the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) deeming recent filings for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds inadequate.  After that initial shock, BTC stabilized at around $30,000 and by press time had begun to recoup some losses, returning to just shy of $30.5000. Other cryptocurrencies largely followed BTC’s price action in both directions.  The volatility wiped out more than 68,000 traders, per CoinGlass, liquidating $116 million of long (bets on higher prices) and $100 million of short (bets on lower prices) positions. Liquidations happen when an exchange closes leveraged positions due to a partial or total loss of the initial margin because the trader doesn’t have enough funds to keep the position open.  BTC traders endured $65 million of losses, mostly liquidating longs, followed by ether (ETH) traders with $36 million of mostly short liquidations.  Bitcoin cash (BCH), was responsible for $22 million of liquidations. The token almost tripled its price in June and experienced a resurgence in trading activity after being one of the four assets listed on EDX Markets, a new crypto exchange backed by traditional finance heavyweights Citadel, Fidelity and Schwab.

This comes after asset management giants BlackRock and Fidelity submitted their applications to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: Cardano Shows Signs of Recovery: When Will it Reach $0.30? The Wall Street Journal reported that the SEC shared its perspective on the filings with Nasdaq and Cboe. Specifically, the agency expressed that the filings lacked clarity and comprehensiveness. Following the release of this news, Bitcoin experienced a drop of nearly 2% in its value. Similarly, other altcoins, including XRP, also saw a decline in their respective charts. Over the past 24 hours, XRP witnessed a decrease of approximately 1%, while on the weekly chart, it recorded a loss of more than 4%. As a result, the technical outlook turned bearish, leading to a decrease in investor interest. The charts reflected a decline in both demand and accumulation. Currently, XRP is hovering around a crucial support level, and a breach of this level may potentially trigger an upward movement for XRP. The market capitalization of XRP decreased, indicating that sellers had a stronger grip on the market. XRP Price Analysis: One-Day Chart As of the time of writing, the altcoin XRP was trading at $0.46. Currently, XRP has reached its lowest level since the end of May. This level has historically acted as a significant support level for the coin. This level is often referred to as a bullish order block, and it has the potential to drive price recovery. Looking ahead, the first hurdle for XRP would be the resistance at $0.48, followed by a potential move above the $0.50 mark. However, if XRP faces another rejection at $0.50, it could lead to a return to trading at $0.46 and possibly even a further decline to $0.43. Technical Analysis Due to low demand, there has been a decline in buying interest. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently below the half-line and close to the 40-mark, suggesting that buyers have lost their influence and sellers have gained control. Similarly, XRP has dropped below the 20-Simple Moving Average line. This indicates a weakening demand and implies that sellers are currently driving the price momentum in the market As demand for the altcoin decreased, the altcoin generated sell signals, although these signals were diminishing in size. This indicates that the bearish momentum might be subsiding. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed red histograms associated with the sell signals, but their size was decreasing. This suggests that while bearish sentiment still existed, the price could potentially experience a rebound in the near future.

42410256,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcwfBw,1688143512,Will Europe’s Digital Euro Really Protect Privacy?,"Someone needs to remind the European Commission that it can’t have its cake and eat it too.  An EC proposal this week for regulating a future central bank digital currency (CBDC) insisted that it must “protect privacy,” describing a system of NFC chip-based offline payments in which “nobody would be able to see what people are paying for.”  This recognizes European citizens’ civil liberties, as politicians are wont to do. But you can be forgiven for seeing it as mere lip service. A review of the proposal’s explicit record-keeping provisions for payment service providers challenges those intentions, especially in light of recent European government crackdowns on cryptographic privacy.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The fact is the European Commission – and for that matter, the governments of the U.S., U.K. and other major liberal democracies – has generally shown itself incapable of embracing real privacy in digital money. They want the facade of privacy, something that lets them sell the idea that Western democracies would never engage in the kind of round-the-clock surveillance for which China is accused, while retaining the power to uncover users’ identities when needed.  I mean, what exactly is the difference?  European proponents of privacy-preserving CBDCs say they want to recreate the freedom of cash. But as security analyst Lukasz Olejnik pointed out this week in his critique of the European proposal, these models are a long way from the anonymity of euro notes. In the case of the offline NFC transactions, service providers would be required to record data on the amount spent; the phone or other device’s unique identifier; the date and time of the transactions and the account numbers used. Does any such identifying information get logged when you hand over a banknote to a merchant? No.  Meanwhile, the crackdowns on open-source privacy projects are a clear indication that tolerance for people engaging in private, non-monitored transactions is low, whether in Europe or elsewhere. The Netherlands played a very active role in prosecuting the U.S. case against Ethereum-based mixing service Tornado Cash, arresting developer Alexey Pertsev days after the U.S. Office of Foreign Asset Control took the unprecedented step of placing the open-source software system – not a person, nor a company, but a body of code – on its list of sanctioned foreign persons.  Misplaced enforcement actions  The Tornado Cash enforcement, which civil rights activists decry as an attack on free speech, sent a chill through the pro-privacy cryptography community. It fears for innovation in the field as developers worry about reprisals by security agencies.  Sure enough, the legal pressure on privacy coin Zen reached such extremes this week that developers relented and altered the code to strip it of its privacy protections. Zen transactions are now open for all to see, which prompts the question: why bother?  This crackdown is boneheaded. We are entering into an artificial intelligence era in which digital systems are extracting ever-ballooning amounts of data from our digital activity and can use it to manipulate us. Privacy tech is a bulwark against that encroachment into our lives. Our leaders have expressed concern about AI’s invasive powers, so they should be encouraging the development of these innovative solutions, not driving them out of town.  Let’s recognize that a half-century (since the introduction of the 1971 Bank Secrecy Act) of ever-expanding compliance rules to enable government surveillance of financial activity has built such a complex web of compliance requirements for financial institutions that true digital privacy is mostly impossible without tearing down that entire complex of regulations. That sort of reform runs counter to the principles of that surveillance system, which governments built in a (mostly futile) effort to curb money laundering and other forms of illicit finance.  Compromise?  This brings me back to not getting the cake and expecting to eat it too: maybe governments should give up on the illusion they can be trusted to protect privacy. They should admit that, at some basic level, these institutions systematically demand information from the people they govern. And maybe, just maybe, with that open recognition, we can start to figure out a compromise that makes sense.  The European Commission has shown itself incapable of embracing real privacy in digital money  You see, unlike Olejnik, I think CBCDs, if done right, could bring real economic value. I see the smart contract capabilities enabled by true peer-to-peer monetary settlement bringing new, society-wide efficiencies that bank-intermediated IOU money simply cannot. I continue to prefer a private sector-led stablecoin model and believe bitcoin and other native cryptocurrencies are critical to our financial future. But it’s simplistic to dismiss CBDCs as meaningless. Whether crypto people like it or not, CBDCs will bring the power of monetary programmability to the economy. (Bafflingly, the EC proposal would explicitly outlaw that value-added usage for a digital euro – which, again, prompts the question: what’s the point?)  Is there a world in which an enlightened but realistic government, one that is equally committed to its citizens’ freedoms as to its international obligations that it root out bad guys from the financial system, can find a workable CBDC compromise on privacy? Such a middle-ground solution would never promise to recreate true cash-like privacy, but it would erect a host of cryptographic and legal barriers that would make it extremely cumbersome and difficult for governments to snoop on users, requiring that only under the most extreme circumstances and with a court order, might they be able to access the so-called “back door.”  Zero-knowledge proofs and other pro-privacy tech make such models feasible. The Project Hamilton initiative jointly run by the MIT Digital Currency Initiative and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is developing this kind of privacy-preserving template for the Federal Reserve to consider. It’s just an experiment and at this stage it seems very unlikely that the Fed will be so enlightened in its development of a digital dollar.  But if the U.S. and the Europeans won’t do it, perhaps there’s an opening for other governments.  In the coming years, I see online privacy elevated in importance, not just for individuals but for businesses, which will start to view their transaction history as a kind of property right.

The Liquid Marketplace is an on-demand liquidity network for professional and institutional traders. This platform allows traders to send requests for quotes (RFQs) to market makers for large digital asset transactions. OKX Liquid Marketplace Experiences Rapid Growth In Q2 In a press release on Friday, OKX announced that its Liquid Marketplace has now exceeded $3 billion. “This milestone is a testament to the Liquid Marketplace’s success in providing institutional traders with deep liquidity and reliable execution,” the press statement read. Related Reading: Whales Dive Into XRP, Accumulating $170 Million Worth: What’s Their Game Plan? In April 2023, OKX revealed that the institutional Liquid Marketplace recorded over $1 billion in trading volume in the first quarter of 2023. As of now – the end of June and 2023 Q2, this figure has more than tripled, surpassing the $3 billion mark. Furthermore, the Liquid Marketplace has been advancing in innovation and product development lately. A few days ago, OKX disclosed the launch of the “Nitro Spreads” feature on the institutional trading platform. Nitro Spreads allows professional and institutional traders to make complex basis trades in a single click. Basis trading refers to trading the difference between an asset’s price on two distinct markets, such as spot vs futures, to generate profits. This type of trading can be cumbersome, as it usually requires both legs of the trade to be executed simultaneously. However, Nitro Spreads automates this process by executing the two legs of the trade via a central orderbook. On the Liquid Marketplace, traders can use the feature across any combination of the spot, perpetual, and futures markets. OKB Price Slows Down, Makes No Significant Movement In The Past Week While the OKX ecosystem has been surrounded by positivity in recent days, this has not been reflected in the price of OKB, the exchange’s native token. The coin has not registered any loss or gain in the past seven days, according to CoinGecko data. That said, the OKB token appears to be losing the momentum that pushed its price by nearly 13% in the previous week. The cryptocurrency has also not made any significant price movement since then. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Stalls Below $31,000, Is The Best Time To Buy Next Monday?

As of this writing, the OKB token changes hands at $44.53, representing a 2.6% price increase in the last 24 hours.

42410252,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcwevP,1688139296,"Bitcoin Cash, FTX’s FTT Token and COMP Led Crypto Market Gains in June","Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was the top performing digital asset this month, with most of the gains coming in the last week and a half following its listing on EDX Markets, the crypto exchange backed by Fidelity, Charles Schwab and Citadel, that debuted June 20.  The token gained 171% over the month, outperforming bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency, which added 14%, CoinDesk data show. At one point on Friday BCH had surged 30% over 24 hours, touching 14-month high of $320.  The surge was backed by a notable increase in trading activity on South Korea's most prominent digital assets exchange, Upbit. Data tracked by Coingecko show the bitcoin cash-Korean won (BCH/KRW) pair listed on Upbit has registered a trading volume of $558 million in the past 24 hours. That's nearly 3.5 times bigger than the volume of $160 million in Upbit's BTC/KRW pair and 5.5 times the BCH/USD volume of $87 million on the Nasdaq-listed Coinbase exchange.  Bitcoin cash’s outperformance in June may be attributed to a perception that forks of the Bitcoin blockchain may pose a lower regulatory risk, said Matt Kunke, a research analyst at GSR.  “Liquidations were also a key component of BCH strength, particularly during the last day, as ~$15m of shorts were liquidated, the most out of any coin excluding BTC/ETH,” he said.  June has not only seen the two largest crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, under fire from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which caused altcoins to dip, but has also witnessed a number of large institutions pushing further into crypto toward the end of the month, igniting positive sentiment. Bitcoin rose as a result, touching a one-year-high above $31,000 a few days after BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, applied for a spot ETF on June 15.  “In crypto, we’ve been saying ‘the institutions are coming’ every year, and that rallying cry often drives the market narrative,” said Michael Safai, managing partner at Dexterity, an algorithmic high-frequency trading firm.  “While we’ve seen varying degrees of institutional participation over the years, no one has had the trillion-dollar gravitas of BlackRock, who clearly seem to be the driver of BTC gains this past month.”  Also gaining on the month was FTT, the token of bankrupt crypto exchange, FTX. FTT climbed 124% in June. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that the bankrupt exchange is in talks with investors about moving ahead with plans to reboot.  Another advancer was the native token of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Compound (COMP) which rallied 50% in four days following a spike in volume and outflows on Binance. COMP is up 58% in June.

42410250,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcweon,1688137802,Web3 Can Actually Compete in the Computer Chip Race,"The GPU shortage will drive mainstream adoption of Web3 infrastructure.  To train artificial intelligence (AI) models, high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) like the NVIDIA A100s and H100s are required. However, these GPUs are only needed for a limited period of time for each model, are very expensive and have a constrained supply – this combination means owning them is out of reach for many startups.  Amy James and Devon James are co-executive directors of the Web3 Working Group.  Further, many people have serious concerns about AI safety, from worries about how deep fake images could harm people or the economy to fears of a Terminator-like malevolent AGI determined to destroy society. [AGI stands for artificial general intelligence, meaning an autonomous system that surpasses human capabilities, aka “the Singularity.]  Decentralized physical infrastructure networks (increasingly known as DePIN), specifically compute and storage networks, offer the solution and will make AI and Web3 go mainstream for two reasons: access and safety.  Despite existing for nearly a decade, use of Web3 has remained limited to a narrow audience of crypto believers. This has befuddled enthusiasts who had expected Web3 to be adopted even faster than the World Wide Web. After all, the original web protocol had to start from nothing while decentralized Web3 protocols have the benefit of the existing web.  But mainstream users have not yet joined decentralized social networks or use protocols like decentralized file storage because they don’t have a strong enough need for them. For most people, despite awareness of Web2 platforms engaging in mass surveillance and manipulation, these services work “just fine” and their powerful network effects lock users in.  The emergence of AI will lead to a breakout moment for Web3 infrastructure because these protocols offer solutions to the GPU shortage and data challenges faced by AI startups. DePIN will transform AI development and, in the process, onboard the first mainstream users to Web3 protocols.  AI startup founders have the technical ability and motivation to push past the friction that has held back mainstream audiences so far, such as having to buy tokens via a clunky user experience, because these founders require access to high quality, expensive, difficult to acquire GPUs in order to succeed.  Protocols like Akash, often described as “Airbnb for GPUs,” provide decentralized marketplaces for GPU owners to rent their resources. These protocols democratize AI innovation by making high-cost resources accessible to smaller players, all while allowing hardware owners to generate passive income.  And while AI startup founders will come to Web3 protocols to get access to the GPUs they need, they will stay because these protocols unlock new features that aren’t available on the Web, allowing Web3 to compete effectively.  File storage protocols like Arweave disrupt the data oligopoly by providing a one-time-payment model for permanent data storage. Using permanent storage for training data makes machine learning open and verifiable, enhancing trust for AI models.  Right now AI products from large companies like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard are leading the movement, but this is a case where open source versions have a competitive advantage.  See also: What's Behind the AI Crypto Hype? | (Video)  AI can only know the difference between two round objects like an apple and a baseball because it's been told thousands of times by human inputs which is which. We have all been unknowingly creating training data for AI models when we fill out a CAPTCHA by selecting the boxes that have bicycles or traffic lights or bridges.  When this type of training data is proprietary and controlled by a company, can it be trusted?  Competitive agents  The AI use case is unique in that open, publicly-available training data will not just be more trustworthy, it will be better quality. Open models can exchange information and accelerate their learning, making each next version better in a virtuous spiral of iteration.  Further, open source framework like zkML, or ""zero-knowledge machine learning,"" a research field being pursued by Sam Altman's Worldcoin project, offer cryptographic proofs for AI models verifying they were trained on specific datasets, thus enhancing the credibility of the output.  Although some fear AI will lead to a dystopian authoritarian future, DePIN provides the antidote for both trustworthy code and the physical infrastructure networks on which it runs. If startup founders build their apps on infrastructure controlled by internet Goliath’s like Amazon Web Services (AWS), it is not only difficult for startups to compete because they have to pay a huge portion of revenues to their competitor, but they also take on counterparty risk.  If a Web3 app is successful it could be seen as competition by the Amazons and Googles on which they depend, and therefore might be cut off from the infrastructure they need. DePIN offers founders infrastructure that is more reliable, resilient to attack and much less expensive.  And the benefits of DePIN for AI startups extend beyond training data and hardware access. As deep fakes become increasingly common and erode public trust in online content – such as the “Pentagon explosion” photos, which caused a brief $500 billion market reaction – Web3 protocols provide the solution via public key cryptography.  To those of us in the crypto space the benefits of cryptographic signatures seem obvious, but AI doomers have yet to discover this solution. Public-key cryptography provides unique, unforgeable signatures which can be used to establish provenance and evaluate the trustworthiness of content.  See also: 10 Ways Crypto and AI Can Make Each Other Better  The GPU shortage could end up motivating startup founders to use DePIN protocols, but the features these protocols unlock will help the apps built on them win against Web2 incumbents. AI apps built with decentralized infrastructure will have the advantages of optimized job routing to reduce latency, faster and lower-cost commerce via micropayments, all kinds of smart contract functionality and automatic filtering of data to keep deep fakes and spam out of our feeds.  DePIN offers better access and features at lower costs to AI startups, creating fertile ground for development and competition. Users of these emergent AI applications will become users of Web3 protocols, often without even realizing it.  This behind-the-scenes integration will introduce users to the benefits of the decentralized web, providing a seamless experience that helps to overcome the traditional hurdles of Web3 adoption.

Oh no! Another rejection The crypto market was alive and buzzing once again, looking as though it had finally emerged from a harsh crypto winter on the back of institutional ETF filings that looked as though this time might be approved. Gary Gensler at the SEC was having none of it. Blackrock, Fidelity et al could be damned. The Biden administration is absolutely determined to try and break the crypto industry, and even if the biggest institutional money in the country wants in, it’s not going to happen on Gensler’s watch. The news dropped like a bomb onto the crypto market. The Wall Street Journal was first to report it with the headline: “SEC Says Spot Bitcoin ETF Filings Are Inadequate” Assuming that Blackrock and the rest had done their homework on the Bitcoin Spot ETF, it was hard to imagine what on earth else might be required by the SEC. Crypto market plummets In a matter of seconds bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market plummeted lower. Bitcoin immediately dropped to the exact bottom of its bull flag, made a beautiful touch, and then bounced back. It is currently sitting at the $30,200 price mark, which also happens to be the 0.618 Fibonacci level. The altcoins fell even more drastically. The Total 3 chart (all cryptocurrencies except BTC and ETH) fell like a stone, losing over 4%, equivalent to around $13 billion in value. Bitcoin Cash (BCH), probably the coin riding the highest up until the SEC announcement, rapidly fell over 13%, dropping from $314 to $272, before bouncing back around half way to $293. Was the news as bad as all that? Senior Bloomberg Analyst Eric Balchunas tweeted out soon after the announcement saying that in his view the news was not as bad as the headline suggested. He said that the SEC was really after the name of the crypto exchange for the “surveillance-sharing agreement” and required more details on SSA. Hold up a second, this isn't as bad as headline. The key paragraph is deep in story. Basically SEC wants them to name the ""crypto exchange"" and give more details on SSA. That's understandable, arguably good news. I was under impression they'd have to update that as well. pic.twitter.com/bh9qn65Xh2 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 30, 2023 It does look as though the market is starting to digest this, and if the ETFs aren’t being outright rejected then a surge in the opposite direction might be expected to take place.

Institutional Interest In Crypto Assets Is Growing The Institutional Crypto Outlook Survey, which surveyed 208 Binance VIP and Institutional users from 31st March to 15th May 2023, found out that a growing number of institutional crypto investors are in it for the long haul. According to the survey, 63.5% of these users had a positive outlook on digital assets over the next 12 months, while 88% are more positive over the next decade.

Bitcoin remains Most Popular Crypto Asset Among Institutions Bitcoin remains the most popular choice among institutional investors, with a larger proportion of respondents more positive about Bitcoin as compared to the broader crypto sector. This is not surprising given that Bitcoin is the largest crypto by market cap and the most established. Bitcoin is seen as the “digital gold” of the crypto world and a store of value and hedge against inflation.

Institutional Trade Still Mostly Done On Centralized Exchanges Centralized exchanges remain the most popular platform for institutional trading. While many crypto investors advocate for decentralized exchanges on the rise, centralized exchanges like Binance offer a one-stop shop for institutional traders to easily buy, sell and convert a wide range of cryptocurrencies. The survey found that 90.5% of institutional investors would rather trade on centralized exchanges. Related Reading: Whales Dive Into XRP, Accumulating $170 Million Worth: What’s Their Game Plan?

42410262,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcwfZ5,1688133118,Why Tokenized Assets Are Safer During a Banking Crisis,"Maybe I’m a grim reaper of banking crises, because I’ve lived through three of them in the last decade. I’m used to banks saying some version of “actually, we’ve lost your money and that’s just a number you see on your screen….it’s not really there.”  Born and raised in Greece to Lebanese parents, and now living in Cyprus, I’ve paid for the failed risk governance of banks on this island (2013), the 2016 capital controls in Greece limiting people to 20 euros a day, and the hyperinflation and value-loss of having my dollar deposits turned to “Lollars” in Lebanon. Yes, I’ve racked up plenty of air miles travelling through Athens, Larnaca and Beirut.  None of these crises were predicted.  The Lebanese Central Bank governor, now with an outstanding arrest warrant by Interpol, was once revered as one of the best “financial engineers” in the world.  Cyprus has been an outstanding financial services and tax efficient hub for several decades.  Greece, a long-term European Union member, and one of the first to adopt the Euro currency, boasts more than 20% of the global shipping fleet, the largest in the world, not to mention one of the best tourism sectors.  When a bank crisis comes to a theatre next to you, it’s not a movie you were expecting to see.  Fadi Aboualfa is the Head of Research at digital asset custodian Copper.co. In 2017 he founded Diar, a niche data-driven crypto newsletter before moving into private consulting and later settling in at Copper. The opinions in this article do not necessarily reflect those of Copper.co.  This year, we’ve seen several banks in the U.S. fail. Thankfully, the Federal Reserve seems to be listening in on the cunning yield farming mechanics seen in crypto and came up with the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) allowing banks to mark-to-market assets held-to-maturity. It’s something like a smart-contract that holds an asset till a certain block-height and removes the dependency of an oracle so to speak. We’re happy to help, no thanks necessary.  Many American crypto outfits felt the ramifications of the loss of banking services. For example, Circle, the issuer of USDC, saw its stablecoin briefly de-peg for the very first time as it had several billion in commercial cash deposits with Silicon Valley Bank.  Had there been no intervention, Circle would have recouped a mere $250,000 of its $3.3bn cash balance from the FDIC insurance protection scheme, which was about 8% of the total assets holding the peg. All bank depositors would pay for the interest-rate risk kerfuffle to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. A regional, or bigger, depression would have ensued.  Crypto markets reacted correctly and incorrectly at the same time. While a de-peg was warranted until regulators came out with a plan, the total cash held at SVB was a fraction of the USDC reserve composition of underlying assets. The remaining backing for the stablecoin was in Treasury Bills, managed by Blackrock, a trail of assets likely held across several custodians.  Which brings us to one of the key points of this opinion piece: if you’re a high net worth individual or business, you’d be better off holding a de-pegged USDC than having a cash deposit insured up to $250k when your bank fails. It’s really that simple. And now there are a few more options developing and gaining traction on blockchain markets, such as tokenized bonds and money market funds.  Yes, digital assets really are safer than commercial bank deposits plus-government insurance during a banking crisis.  Take it from me.  Evolving definitions of cash  Money has always constituted a part of counterparty risk – that is, who, in the event of a financial crisis, is the best position to pay the liability.  On one end of the spectrum, we have central banks offering physical cash, T-bills and bonds to the least degree of separation from a government liability.  On the other side, we have commercial banks that have a capped insurance limit because fractionalized banking means that depositors are at the behest of the risk management teams who have already loaned that deposit to someone for profit. Hence why what you consider an asset sits as a liability on the other side.  Depositors take on all the risk of banking this way and have no reward. Not even today where bonds are paying a pretty penny. Instead, they are faced with an incessant amount of obscure fees and KYC/AML measures akin to strangulation. Oh, you’ve made transfers to crypto exchanges, have you? Are you buying fentanyl?  Banks, mind you, aren’t the only counter-party that have such structures. Stock and exchange brokers have similar setups, which is why there is capped insurance on your stocks and money market funds too, albeit only to $500k, through SIPC.  So, what’s safe?  One of the very first and primary use cases of crypto – self-custody and custody management of your private keys, allows investors to identify and remove several key risk factors.  Firstly, what is the composition of the asset. In the case of Circle USDC, it’s cash (approximately 10%) and T-Bills (about 90%). This helps identify the risk parameters clearly.  Secondly, who and how many counter-parties are involved in managing the asset cycle? In the case of tokenized real-world assets, the issuers will likely opt for segregated custody, meaning, the risk of re-hypothecation that can lead to counter-party default and loss of assets is removed.  Most importantly: it’s yours. Your keys, your assets, no middlemen pushing for a haircut.  The reality is that blockchain tech hasn’t scaled. We can’t claim success in many of the industry’s prevailing narratives over the past decade and a half. What we can say, is that despite the slow rails, there is a use case for individuals to minimize, or even remove, the liability and counterparty risk simply by managing their private keys for segregated real-world assets.  Perhaps, parked USDC is a good hedge against commercial bank failures and limited insurance protection.  Or, consider OpenEden’s T-Bill, where underlying short-term Treasuries are held in segregated accounts with traditional qualified custodian. It’s fractionalized, liquid, transferable, pays you the coupon, with no exposure to commercial banks and a direct liability to the Federal Reserve.  Until we have real-world assets directly minted on the blockchain, we must look at the best counterparty structure as of today and where the paper assets sit.  Maybe what I’ve said here hasn’t resonated with you because you haven’t been through the banking crises I’ve witnessed. Maybe you expect central banks to bail out banks when things go bad, like in 2008. Which was around the time Bitcoin was created.

The news sent the price of bitcoin (BTC) plunging by $1,000, or more than 3%, in the space of a few minutes. At press time, bitcoin was trading just above $30,000.  According to the story, the SEC has informed Nasdaq and CBOE – the exchanges that filed the spot ETF paperwork for several of the asset managers, including BlackRock (BLK) and Fidelity – that the applications aren’t sufficiently clear and comprehensive.  At issue, the story continued, is that the filings didn't have enough detail with respect to the “surveillance-sharing agreements,"" including which spot bitcoin exchange would be used. The asset managers can update their applications and refile, and the CBOE indicated to the WSJ and to CoinDesk that it plans to do so.  The SEC said in previous ETF rejection orders that the sponsor of a bitcoin trust would have to enter a surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size.  A market of significant size is one where anyone trying to manipulate the price of an exchange-traded product has to trade on the same market the exchange-traded product (ETP) is based on, meaning the agreement would let the sponsor and the trading platform identify any wannabe market manipulators.  At present, no federal regulator has oversight of spot bitcoin markets, a state of affairs the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has lobbied to change for years.  ""We would decline to comment on the possibility of individual filings,"" an SEC spokesperson told CoinDesk.  BlackRock's spot ETF filing in mid-June had been the impetus for a strong run higher in the price of bitcoin since, sending the crypto from below $26,000 to one-year highs above $31,000. The BlackRock application also set off a host of filings from several other asset managers, including fellow asset management giants Invesco (IVZ) and Fidelity, both of which refiled for approval of their previously rejected spot bitcoin ETFs.  BlackRock, Fidelity, and Galaxy (who filed in conjunction with Invesco) spokespeople all declined to comment to CoinDesk.

42410251,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcwes6,1688131977,What New York Can Learn From Hong Kong in Regulating Crypto,"Web3 companies are leaving New York, fomented by Washington D.C.’s recent combative approach to regulating the industry. The Big Apple’s global relevance in relation to other major financial hubs is diminishing because regulators have spurned the wishes of the city’s leadership – but China and Hong Kong have proven it does not have to be this way.  Over the past 100 days, China and the U.S. have been on divergent paths when it comes to regulation. After an 18-month period of hostility, the former appears to have pivoted, rapidly implementing common-sense regulations in Hong Kong that foster innovation and encourage the sector to grow. This all happened because officials in Beijing listened to and supported Hong Kongers and their leaders, something U.S. securities regulators seem hell-bent on avoiding.  Omer Ozden is chairman of RockTree Capital, a Web3 investment fund from Beijing. He was previously a U.S. securities attorney practicing in Hong Kong and New York.  New York City Mayor Eric Adams has embraced Web3 from the beginning, running a pro-crypto campaign and even taking his initial paychecks in bitcoin. This democratically elected official has touted the benefits and actively engaged the industry with a blueprint for the economic recovery of the city, but bureaucrats in D.C. disagree.  Currently, a small number of unelected individuals in Washington D.C. are exercising alarming authoritarian power in their seats as regulators, counter to New York’s stated desire to move from antiquated financial systems to digital ones.  Hong Kong’s example  In the summer of 2021, China’s government aggressively targeted the crypto industry by banning financial institutions and payment companies from providing services related to digital asset transactions, and expelling crypto exchanges with domestic operations. Central authorities in Beijing took a draconian approach to this nascent technology.  Beijing’s restrictive policy, and the Hong Kong securities regulator’s lack of clarity, resulted in the loss of many entrepreneurs, high-skilled jobs, investors (with their billions of dollars of capital), exchanges and countless other active participants of the industry. From China, these people moved to Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai, Silicon Valley and beyond. Technological innovation and the further development of the country’s capital markets was resolutely stifled. Yet, what transpired afterwards is quite impressive: It appears that Chinese authorities realized the damaging impact of this ruinous direction and decided to dramatically change course in late 2022.  China’s great pivot  This past December, a former monetary policy official from China publicly voiced the view that “banning cryptocurrencies may be practical in the short term but, whether it is sustainable in the long term, deserves in-depth analysis” and stressed the need for developing an appropriate regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Those of us in Beijing know that public statements like this are not made without being in alignment with the central government’s thinking.  After watching crypto exchanges, capital, and real-estate tenants leave Hong Kong, the newly appointed executive leader, John Lee, consulted with the Web3 industry and developed a plan to eventually turn Hong Kong into a global cryptocurrency hub. He then worked with Hong Kong’s financial regulators to obtain Beijing’s support for his city’s aspirations. This dialogue quickly led to the approval of a robust regulatory framework for Web3 that provides clarity for broker-dealers, investors and crypto exchanges while also ensuring there are adequate considerations for the participation of retail investors.  Make no mistake, this decision was Beijing’s: a geopolitical move for the nation as much as a supportive response to help stimulate economic recovery for Hong Kong, which has traditionally been the gateway of international finance to mainland China. This new framework, implemented on June 1, also acts as a testing ground for the future development of regulations and innovation for the rest of China’s Web3 industry – and Hong Kong’s recovery has been noticeably fast.  The Big Apple sours  New York has the benefit of Hong Kong’s forewarning. Today, as U.S. regulators take a restrictive approach similar to the one China took two years ago, the Web3 industry Adams seeks to foster – including venture-capital funds and projects – is already leaving Silicon Alley and the rest of the nation. Most alarmingly, Coinbase, which has embraced a pro-regulatory approach, is considering leaving the country due to the current environment in the U.S. The Web3 industry is agile.  Both Hong Kong and New York, as financial industry leaders, are natural locations where the Web3 industry can flourish. Fortunately for Hong Kong, Beijing decided to support financial innovation. Unfortunately for New York and the rest of America, regulators in D.C. have decided to decisively suffocate it.  Both Lee and Adams came to power in 2022. Notwithstanding the latter’s pleadings to state and federal regulators to loosen restrictive measures and bring clarity to the crypto industry, regulators have resolutely rejected the wishes of Adams, his constituents and the 50 million Americans who have used cryptocurrency. And, what’s painfully ironic for those living in “the land of the free” is that currently a very small number of unelected individuals with regulatory mandates have taken extraordinary efforts and utilized significant public resources to suffocate innovation.  100 days of contrast  The SEC’s regulation by enforcement, and the constant, ominous drone of its position that stablecoins are securities have paralyzed innovators, investors and highly skilled workers by hanging a Sword of Damocles above the necks of every participant, ready to drop at the whim of an unelected bureaucrat.  USDC has lost $27 billion in market cap from its peak 12 months ago, or nearly 50%. Since this is a U.S. regulated stablecoin, some see the metric as a measure of market consensus on U.S. regulatory confidence: the crypto industry is leaving fast.  As part of Hong Kong’s steps to bring crypto back, regulators have created a stablecoin issuance playbook, and a Hong Kong Dollar-based stablecoin is apparently on the way. There are ongoing discussions of developing a CNH-based stable coin; CNH is the overseas version of China’s Renminbi.  In March, U.S. regulators forced Signature Bank to shutter despite being solvent. Ex-Congressman and board member, Barney Frank, publicly voiced that the bank was closed by politically motivated U.S. authorities to send a strong anti-crypto message. Almost immediately after, China’s state-owned banks swiftly seized the opportunity with the international arms of Bank of China and Bank of Communications moving in to swoop up former clients of Silvergate and Signature in the Southeast Asian market. And, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is officially pressuring major banking institutions in Hong Kong, such as Standard Chartered and HSBC, to accept crypto clients. Meanwhile, as the SEC sues crypto exchanges in the U.S., a Hong Kong politician has been courting them to establish operations in Hong Kong.  In my experience as an investor in Web2 and Web3, and a decades-long practice as a U.S. securities attorney in New York and China at major international law firms, I have seen that the prompt development of permissive, smart laws from legislators is just as critical as the fast development of intelligent code from engineers in order to foster innovation and growth.  Unfortunately, the SEC has framed the overriding regulatory question in America as What is a security? when the smart question for developing smart laws is: How do we foster innovation and economic growth? That is the question Adams has been asking, and the one Lee asked.  Federal legislators and New Yorkers risk suffering the same consequences from this cautionary tale unless they embrace blockchain.

The OKX logo will be displayed on the sleeves of Man City's on-field shirts from next season in addition to its existing berth on the players' training kit, the exchange announced via email on Friday.  OKX will pay the club $70 million over the course of the deal, which will last three years, OKX said.  Sponsorship of elite sports organizations by crypto firms became commonplace in 2021 and 2022, with the likes of FTX and Crypto.com putting their names on stadia and arenas as well as getting their brands visible on players or officials' uniforms.  However, the collapse of FTX in November last year has made clubs think twice before aligning themselves with crypto firms.  ""Our partners definitely wanted to know if we would be in a similar situation to FTX,"" Haider Rafique, OKX's chief marketing officer, told CoinDesk in an interview. ""Rather than answering those questions on an individual basis, we introduced them to our proof of reserves.""  Proof of reserves are a cryptographic way of demonstrating that a crypto exchange is liquid enough to process all customer withdrawals, thereby reassuring its customers that their funds are secure.  Rafique said that partners such as Man City and Formula 1 team McLaren have been auditing OKX's proof of reserves, with board members even emailing the exchange with questions and queries.  ""They were being very critical of us, so passing their litmus test is a real validation for us,"" Rafique said.

Litecoin Outperforms Market With A Strong 18% Surge Like most of the wider cryptocurrency market, LTC had enjoyed a sharp rally a week or so back, which had taken its price above the $90 mark. Unlike coins like Bitcoin, however, the asset had failed to maintain at these post-surge levels, as it slid off during the days that followed, until eventually bottoming out at the low $80 level. In the past day, however, tides seem to have rapidly shifted for Litecoin, as the asset is now trading above $101 after registering a sharp growth of 18% during the last 24 hours. The below chart shows how the cryptocurrency has performed recently. Looks like the coin has observed a sharp uptrend today | Source: LTCUSD on TradingView As you can see in the graph, Litecoin was around the $81 level only a couple of days back. This latest turnaround for the asset has meant that it has now surpassed the high registered around the start of the month. In terms of daily returns, LTC has outperformed almost all the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap; Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the only exception with its whopping 26% gains in the same period. Related Reading: Stablecoin Cap Shows Early Sign Of Reversal, Why This Could Benefit Bitcoin As analyst Tony “The Bull” pointed out on Twitter, Litecoin formed a golden cross just before this surge, as its 50-day moving average (MA) has crossed over its 200-day MA. 2020 it is#Litecoin has golden crossed, days after a death cross Does the rest of history repeat? https://t.co/sGlMhgKE0R pic.twitter.com/CRSaqHSbGt — Tony “The Bull” (@tonythebullBTC) June 30, 2023 Interestingly, only a few days ago, the same MAs had also formed a cross of the opposite type: the death cross. The bullish cross canceling this bearish one out merely days later is a pattern similar to the one seen back in 2020, which preceded the bull run. LTC Only Has 34 Days To Go For The Next Halving Litecoin also has a strong bullish narrative coming up in the form of its halving. The “halving” is an event where the block rewards of the cryptocurrency are permanently cut in half. As the block rewards are the only way to introduce new LTC into the circulating supply, the halving tightens up its production rate. This increased scarcity is why the event has historically been hyped up as a bullish one. Related Reading: Altcoin Whales Show Highly Active Day, Volatility Incoming? Halvings take place roughly every four years, and the next one is estimated to place on August 3, 2023, which is just 34 days away. It now remains to be seen whether the current price surge will be an extended rally that leads to the halving, or if this is another attempt that would run out of steam before long.

Cardinal Starts 2-Months “Notice Period” Nearly a year after raising $4.4 million, Solana’s NFT utility provider, Cardinal Labs, has decided to pack it in. The protocol was launched in early 2022 as an infrastructure provider to improve NFT utility on the Solana network. However, on Wednesday, the Cardinal team took to Twitter to announce that they would be winding down operations and eventually shut shop. They wrote, “Today is the first day of our 2 month “notice period” (6/28-8/26) during which we recommend any and all depositors of assets into our systems manually withdraw them. All of our website product UIs will remain live during the period so that no one should have any issue doing so.” “Product Market Fit Difficult” The team tweeted that the macroeconomic conditions have been very challenging for the protocol. They claimed that product market fit has been difficult, and although there has been some usage of the protocol’s staking, rentals, and identity products, the market has not scaled up as they had hoped it would. Until blockchain tech adoption happens on a larger scale, the protocol’s offerings are “stuck in the context of the crypto maximalist community.” The team also noted that the code behind the protocol will always be open source and accessible by all, even after the deployments are no longer live. They also reassured users that their assets were safe and would be returned to owners by the end of the process. Wind Down Schedule August 26 would mark the end of the two-month notice period, so users will need to complete all withdrawals by that date. The team has also dropped the closing schedule, which revealed that activities like creating staking pools, token management, NFT rentals and rental extensions, management of social media handles, and new deposits would be suspended on July 19. The team tweeted, “As we move towards closing up shop, our focus now shifts to carrying out a wind down as smoothly as possible so that the Solana ecosystem doesn’t skip a beat…We realize that many people and teams rely on our protocols, and we want to minimize the impact of this transition on the ecosystem as much as possible, so we’ve worked deliberately to find a path that does just that.” Another Solana Project Shuts Down Twitter user and crypto expert JagoeCapital pointed out that Solana-related protocols are not faring well in the market. They tweeted, “Cardinal announced a $4.4 Million raise just 11 months ago led by Solana Ventures and ProtagonistXYZ with headline participation from Alameda Research, Animoca Brands and Delphi Digital. Today they announced they will be shutting down. It’s becoming a common theme with Solana projects.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42410285,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcwfVm,1688127917,First Mover Americas: Fidelity Joins the Rush for Spot Bitcoin ETF,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Asset management giant Fidelity has refiled paperwork for its Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, a spot bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF). The move comes roughly two weeks after BlackRock's (BLK) iShares unit submitted paperwork for the iShares Bitcoin Trust, also a spot bitcoin ETF. Fidelity in 2021 had originally applied to launch the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, but that effort was rejected by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2022. Since the BlackRock spot ETF filing earlier in June, a number of other fund companies have done similar, including Invesco (IVZ) and WisdomTree (WT), and a report earlier this week said a Fidelity filing was imminent. Bitcoin (BTC) didn’t move a lot on the news Thursday afternoon, but an overnight rally took the price briefly above $31,000. It’s since fallen back a bit to $30,800.  Bitcoin cash (BCH) continues to rally at a breakneck speed in the wake of Fidelity, Charles Schwab and Citadel-backed EDX Markets' decision to debut on June 20, with BCH being one of the only four coins available for trading on the exchange. The cryptocurrency has gained another 30% in the past 24 hours to a 14-month high of $320, taking its cumulative gain since EDX's debut on June 20 to 183%, CoinDesk data show. The latest price surge is backed by a notable increase in trading activity on South Korea's most prominent digital assets exchange, Upbit.  Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by market value, said its institutional clients are optimistic on the outlook of crypto for the next year and beyond, according to a survey it conducted between March and May 2023. The study – undertaken by Binance Research and the Binance VIP & Institutional team – surveyed 208 clients, nearly a quarter of whom had assets under management (AUM) above $100 million and just over half of whom had AUM less than $25 million. Just shy of two-thirds of respondents (63.5%) said they are positive on the outlook of crypto for the next year and 88% said they are optimistic for the next decade, according to the report.  Chart of the Day  The chart show changes in notional open interest in futures tied to bitcoin cash since February 2020. Open interest refers to the number of active contracts at a given point of time.  The dollar value locked in open contracts has surged to $362 million from $50 million in ten days, indicating an influx of new money into the market.  The cryptocurrency's spot market price has jumped over 183% since June 20.

14350963,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540556,1688126427,Ethereum Continues Uptrend As Staked ETH Soars To New High,"The Ethereum network is currently witnessing a surge in interest following the recent Shanghai upgrade, which has expanded the options for holders of Ethereum (ETH). This has resulted in an uptick in the number of people staking their ETH in beacon deposit contracts, an indication of the growing confidence in the Ethereum blockchain since the upgrade. Since the Shanghai upgrade, the quantity of staked ETH has been increasing at a swift pace. This growth recently hit a peak, breaking previous records and suggesting that Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) has been received positively by the market. New Era For Ethereum The amount of Ethereum staked has now hit an all-time high (ATH), surpassing 25.8 million ETH, equivalent to a value of over $48 billion, according to the latest data shared by blockchain and crypto industry analytics platform, CryptoRank. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Over $40 Billion After Shanghai Upgrade: What It Means For ETH This development has caused quite a stir in the crypto community and provides insight into the evolving dynamics of the Ethereum blockchain. Just a month earlier, in late May, the Ethereum deposit contract balance had crossed the $40 billion mark. This upward movement underscores the effectiveness of the new features introduced during Ethereum’s transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) to the PoS consensus mechanism after the Merge upgrade. Furthermore, the impact of the Shanghai upgrade on the Ethereum ecosystem has been profound. The surge in the Ethereum staking ratio since the upgrade is indicative of growing interest and faith in the Ethereum blockchain’s potential. This, in turn, reflects on the success of the Shanghai upgrade and the Merge in aligning ETH with market expectations and needs. While the influx of staked ETH steadily rises, Ethereum’s creator, Vitalik Buterin, has recently expressed concerns regarding the potential strain this could put on the network’s consensus. In a recent blog post, he urged caution, stating, “Don’t overload Ethereum’s consensus.” Buterin went on to emphasize that utilizing Ethereum’s consensus for diverse functions could introduce elevated systemic threats to the ecosystem and should be actively discouraged. Despite this cautionary advice, there has been no decrease in ETH staking activity, only a consistent increase.

Then BlackRock — the world’s largest asset manager — filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 15. WisdomTree, Invesco, and several others previously filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF in 2022. All were denied. Many believed that BlackRock “knew something” that would suggest that the SEC would be willing to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF. BlackRock brought the crypto ETF industry back into the spotlight. And many investors and advisors are wondering whether a spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved, what this means for Bitcoin, and what the crypto ETF industry will look like in the future. This note provides a high-level overview of recent news and looks at the future of spot Bitcoin ETFs, blockchain ETFs, and more. BlackRock, Grayscale, and Spot ETFs It seemed like many investors had forgotten about Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Then BlackRock ( BLK ) — the world’s largest asset manager — filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 15. The BlackRock filing was followed by filings from other major players like WisdomTree and Invesco. WisdomTree, Invesco, and several others previously filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF in 2022. All were denied. This has all happened amidst the SEC’s current legal battle with Grayscale over its request to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) to a spot Bitcoin ETF. So why now for BlackRock? Many believed that BlackRock “knew something” that would suggest that the SEC would be willing to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF. Other theories floated around, but none had any proof. But filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF means that BlackRock sees value in launching a spot Bitcoin ETF. And because of its size, reputation, and knowledge of the regulatory environment, there could eventually be a chance of approval. Although, there is no easy way to predict when that would happen. Approval for BlackRock would also increase the likelihood of approval for Grayscale and other similar spot Bitcoin ETFs. But up to this point, the SEC hasn’t seemed to change its stance on spot Bitcoin ETFs. Why Is This Important for ETFs? The SEC has so far been resistant to a spot Bitcoin ETF. Why? Because of the possibility of fraud and manipulation due to a lack of regulation. Right now, the SEC has only approved futures-based ETFs since the CFTC regulates futures. If a spot Bitcoin ETF were to be approved, it could be extremely impactful for the crypto ETF industry. According to the Bitwise VettaFi 2023 Benchmark Survey, 32% of advisors surveyed said they would be more comfortable allocating to crypto assets in the future if there was a spot-based ETF. And 68% said that their preferred way to invest in crypto would be an ETF. This would also catch the crypto ETF industry in the U.S. up to other countries, including Canada, which currently offer spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin Prices Come Back to Life Along With Some Positive Regulatory Signals Since news of the BlackRock filing, the price of Bitcoin has increased 20% to $30,700. Before this, Bitcoin had briefly touched $30,000 in April. But it has hovered mostly between $20,000 to $30,000 since mid-2022 when interest in crypto ETFs and Bitcoin was waning. There have also been several regulatory shifts over the past few weeks that may now suggest that the SEC has become more accepting of crypto. On June 20, EDX Markets launched a digital asset market backed by Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and Citadel. In contrast to other crypto exchanges, investors will be able to trade through financial intermediaries instead of relying on an exchange to maintain custody (like with FTX). On June 27, the first leveraged Bitcoin ETF started trading - the Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITX ) . Last year, the SEC also approved the first inverse Bitcoin ETF — the ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITI ) . Both BITX and BITI use futures to track the price of Bitcoin. However, it’s still been surprising to many in the industry that the SEC would approve a leveraged product and an inverse product before a spot ETF. These events may be a positive signal for the SEC’s attitude toward crypto. But there’s still a notable difference between the way the SEC feels about futures-based Bitcoin ETFs versus spot-based ones. This means approval of a spot-based ETF may still be far away. Blockchain ETFs Are Still Losing Investor Interest It may also be the case that a spot Bitcoin ETF product would take shares from futures-based Bitcoin ETFs like BITO and not receive as much new investor interest. At this point, it seems that many investors are not as interested in Bitcoin as they were when it became a mainstream product. This has been well-illustrated by blockchain and crypto equity ETFs which are a large portion of the current crypto ETF market. These ETFs are industry and/or thematic ETFs. They hold stocks of companies within the crypto ecosystem but are still highly correlated with the price of Bitcoin. After weak performance in 2022 exacerbated by several large events (Celsius, FTX, etc.), these ETFs have been significantly outperforming other ETFs YTD. The Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF ( WGMI ) , for instance, is up 189% YTD and is the best-performing equity ETF yet and has received very little inflows. Typically, higher performance would attract more inflows. But it seems like many investors may have been burned by crypto in the past and are no longer interested. From a thematic perspective, blockchain was the future of technology. And while it’s still a valid theme, investors seem to be more interested in artificial intelligence this year. More conservative investors may only have interest in allocating to one “future tech” theme. And artificial intelligence is a more tangible idea (with so many different apps and websites you can easily play with). AI is also more closely linked to some well-known large-cap names like Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ) , which may give investors more peace of mind relative to Bitcoin, which has been historically volatile. Bottom Line: A lot is happening in the crypto ETF industry. But it’s still uncertain if and when a spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved. A spot Bitcoin ETF will likely be a net positive for crypto ETFs and the overall crypto industry. But blockchain and crypto equity ETFs might be left behind. That’s because investors are looking at other themes and industries like artificial intelligence and semiconductors. Disclosure: © VettaFi LLC 2023. All rights reserved.

No new crypto rules are needed, Kaplan said, and his company means to demonstrate it – even as issuers whose tokens it seeks to trade say no thanks.  When Kaplan held up his company as proof of a “compliant path forward,” though it hasn’t yet made any money or demonstrated the SEC will let it serve crypto customers, he drew criticism from across the industry. He piled on when he argued the established digital assets companies are flaunting the laws at investors’ peril.  Prometheum is an obscure startup with no track record, and crypto insiders are offering detailed explanations for why its model will run afoul of securities law and saying that its managers are glossing over key questions they can’t yet answer. But it’s also in a unique position to demonstrate whether the SEC’s “come in and register” rhetoric means something, after all.  “Over time, when given the opportunity, we'll be able to prove that what we're trying to do is in the best interest of the industry,” Kaplan said in an interview. “If you allow for a compliant mechanism for people to trade and custody digital assets, I think you provide the infrastructure that will allow for that next wave of institutional adoption.”  What Prometheum has that the others don’t is its recent registration as a “special purpose broker-dealer” for digital assets, allowing it to take custody of future customer’s crypto. It’s also one of the few crypto firms to register with the SEC as an “alternative trading system” (ATS), which is a less oversight-burdened version of a national exchange.  Industry figures and lawyers have stepped forward eagerly to explain why Prometheum’s plan to handle the trading of registered or exempted crypto securities won’t work. The SEC requires Prometheum, as a broker-dealer, to “conduct and document an analysis of whether a digital asset is a security offered and sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or an available exemption from registration.”  That demand makes Prometheum’s status “meaningless until there are enough crypto assets to trade“, said Ji Hun Kim, general counsel and head of global policy for the Crypto Council for Innovation. Its special purpose broker-dealer registration “is the equivalent of an empty vending machine.”  But the company says tokens that have been issued under arcane securities-law exemptions are fair game, and it’s already presented a short list of examples to the SEC of securities it can handle. In earlier statements, the company had said its ATS could offer Flow (FLOW), Protocol Labs’ Filecoin (FIL), The Graph (GRT), Compound (COMP) and the Celo platform’s CELO, for starters. Prometheum submitted those names to the regulator as assets it intended to support, and the SEC had an opportunity to reject them.  “There was no objection made,” Kaplan said.  Prometheum is waiting to leap one last SEC hurdle: Official sign-off to be able to clear and settle transactions, which Kaplan said he expects to come soon. Such an approval could represent a moment in crypto history in which the industry finds out if there’s a form of digital assets platform that will be allowed to operate under existing U.S. oversight.  High stakes  If the agency lets Prometheum do what the company plans to do, it threatens the bedrock position of the crypto sector that its companies can’t do business under the SEC’s current interpretation of securities law. But if the agency puts a stop to Prometheum, it reinforces the argument that U.S. regulators are making it impossible to operate a crypto firm here.  The Prometheum question joins several others as potential turning points for crypto in the U.S., including the Ripple Labs Inc. court decision, the outcome of U.S. lawmakers’ wrangling over a crypto oversight bill and the fate of the SEC’s fights with Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) and Binance.  After its broker-dealer approval, the company has been guarded about what digital asset securities will be traded when the platform goes live, though it had submitted the five token projects as examples in its ATS filings.  “I'm not trying to bring, like, the eye of Mordor on these tokens,” Kaplan said.  One of the most prominent of them, Filecoin, is itself objecting to the idea that the token FIL can be traded as a security.  ""Filecoin is an open-source, decentralized file storage network with thousands of contributors worldwide, storing humanity's most important information,” a spokesperson for Protocol Labs, the company behind Filecoin, told CoinDesk. “It is not a security.""  That pushback doesn’t matter to Prometheum’s business plan, Kaplan said, because he said an ATS doesn’t need to work with the issuer of an asset in order to list it.  “As an ATS, you can choose which assets you support based on the needs of your customers,” said Kaplan, who has worked as a securities lawyer.  And the SEC is already backing up the position that FIL and others – including FLOW – are securities, because it’s argued as much in its enforcement actions against other crypto companies.  An SEC spokesperson declined to comment on Prometheum’s status, or the agency’s views on tokens the company may seek to trade.  Kaplan hasn’t been overly specific about how his company will satisfy SEC disclosure demands regarding the assets it’ll handle. “We will meet all our disclosure requirements,” he said.  Industry critics argue that to be legitimate securities, issuers have to file certain updated information to the SEC, and a third party trading platform can’t do it for them. Marisa Tashman Coppel, senior counsel at the Blockchain Association, an industry lobbying organization, was among those contending that Prometheum’s position is bogus.  “Prometheum’s ATS will not be able to trade any tokens – despite their claims to the contrary – unless projects first register with the SEC,” she posted on Twitter.  Another crypto ATS – OTC Markets – agrees that a securities issuer has to provide the information itself. “As the market operator, our role is to determine that the issuer disclosure meets the requirements for public trading, but we couldn’t possibly generate that disclosure ourselves,” said Cass Sanford, deputy general counsel.  Crypto projects that are fighting against being labeled as securities, such as Filecoin, won’t be leaping forward to comply with securities regulations.  Capitalists  Prometheum currently employs about 50 people, Kaplan said, and it will have more capital needs as it grows. He said the company could be open to acquisition (“Capitalists will be capitalists,” he said), and a bigger firm grabbing its potentially valuable registration status could further amplify the urgency of what could happen with the company.  Meanwhile, Kaplan has been accused of being a puppet of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, widely seen by the industry as seeking to throttle U.S. crypto into lifelessness. When Kaplan suddenly appeared in the House hearing, the industry was abuzz with speculation that the SEC had put him there. He said it was the staff of Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) that invited him. He said he’s never met Gensler and has never had any contact with the SEC outside of the typical registration process.  A U.S. senator, Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), also accused his company of being a tool of Chinese investors. Kaplan responded, saying that while HashKey Group, the digital assets and blockchain arm of Chinese conglomerate Wanxiang Group, still owns about 20%, it has no access to the company’s data or technology. He said the SEC, which investigated and subpoenaed the company for information on this relationship, has recently sent a letter to Prometheum stating the question is resolved.  The individual owner with the biggest stake of Prometheum is Kaplan’s father, Martin Kaplan, who co-founded a securities law firm in New York. And Aaron Kaplan’s brother, Benjamin, is the other CEO. The three men’s stakes in the company represent the bulk of Prometheum, making it a kind of family business.  Aaron Kaplan has taken the role as public advocate for the company and has largely abandoned corporate diplomacy for contentious arguments, such as those he made in testimony on Capitol Hill or in a podcast debate this week with a lawyer who represents an investment firm, Paradigm.  “The investor protections of the federal securities laws provide a path forward for the industry to move beyond what occurred in 2022, which was really the result of people operating on unregulated financial intermediaries,” he told CoinDesk. “Give us an opportunity to show what we could do.”  UPDATE (June 30, 2023, 13:31 UTC): Adds SEC's decline to comment.",NEGATIVE,FIL,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIL | MARKET | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/30/the-crypto-industrys-new-favorite-punching-bag-prometheum-asks-for-a-chance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2ce2041bbf204f0763e14686a02f2a591d143460-1856x1034.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission under Gensler has taken a hostile approach to crypto, filing lawsuits against several prominent crypto firms. Blockchain Association Pens Open Letter The call for the Securities and Exchange Commission Chair to remove himself from crypto-related matters was issued in the form of a statement released by the Blockchain Association. It comes after cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase filed a notice of intent on Wednesday, requesting a court to dismiss the regulator’s lawsuit against the exchange. In the letter, the Blockchain Association contends that Gensler has repeatedly asserted that everything other than Bitcoin is a security and that his statement gives the appearance that he cannot approach the issue with an open mind. The letter alleged that repeatedly expressing the same view meant that the SEC chair had prejudiced the central issue regarding digital asset-related enforcement proceedings. As a result, the letter alleged that Gensler’s vote on whether or not to proceed with filing an action was biased. The Blockchain Association also stated that any SEC enforcement action must follow the “Wells Process,” which would give the target of the enforcement action enough time to present evidence and arguments for their case. However, thanks to Gensler’s unbiased perspective, core questions related to the crypto industry would not receive a fair assessment from the SEC. Chief Policy Officer at the Blockchain Association, Jake Chervinksy, stated, “It’s clear that the digital assets industry cannot expect a fair assessment from Chair Gensler. His steadfast view that all digital assets except bitcoin are securities means that he cannot approach enforcement decisions with a fair and impartial mind, as required by the SEC’s Wells process and federal law. The time has come for Chair Gensler to recuse himself from all decisions related to digital asset-related enforcement matters. If he refuses, then I expect enforcement targets will begin raising the matter of his recusal in SEC proceedings and in federal district courts.” Coinbase And The SEC The Securities and Exchange Commission had sued Coinbase, alleging that the platform offered users at least 13 crypto assets that are securities and should have been registered with the SEC. It had also sued Binance on similar charges just a day prior. In its reply, Coinbase stated that the Securities and Exchange Commission was well aware of the crypto exchange’s digital asset operations thanks to its public offering registration, which was done in April 2021. It further added that out of the cryptocurrencies that the SEC called securities, 6 were already trading on Coinbase when the agency reviewed the exchange’s public offering registration. Coinbase stated in its filing, “The only change is in the SEC’s position regarding its powers. That position is untenable as a matter of law, and its assertion through this enforcement action offends due process and the constitutional separation of powers.” SEC Action On Crypto The Securities and Exchange Commission has undertaken considerable legal action against crypto exchanges during the ongoing year. Kraken was fined $30 million for offering crypto staking programs, with the SEC stating that the exchange was offering users unregistered securities. The agency also issued a warning to the Paxos Trust Company, an issuer of the Binance stablecoin, that it faces possible legal action. This led to Paxos freezing the minting of the stablecoin, which the SEC stated was an unregistered security. Coinbase criticized the SEC’s actions in its filing, saying that the SEC’s action in the current scenario was unlawful. “Rather than test its new view through notice-and-comment rulemaking, the SEC has chosen to roll out its ever-aggressive agenda through punitive retroactive enforcement actions. Agency enforcement authority is important but not boundless. The SEC’s action here is beyond those bounds and unlawful.” The Blockchain Association was also critical of the SEC, stating that the federal agency’s actions under Gensler had further muddied regulatory waters and forced lawful crypto companies operating in the country to reconsider their operations and move to friendlier jurisdictions. The Political Divide Gensler’s hostile approach to crypto has found support with many Democrats, who have lauded his efforts. However, lawmakers on the other side of the aisle have roundly criticized the SEC and Gensler’s approach. Republican Congressman Warren Davidson also introduced a bill called the SEC Stabilization Act on the 13th of June. The bill sought to restructure the federal agency and remove Gensler as chair.

42410257,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcwf8d,1688124061,Investor Enthusiasm for Coinbase Shares May Prove Short-Lived: Berenberg,"Coinbase (COIN) shares have jumped more than 30% since June 15 following news that Blackrock (BLK) filed an application for a spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded-fund (ETF), outpacing the 20% gain in the bitcoin price over the same period, investment bank Berenberg said in a research report Thursday.  “We believe the surge in Coinbase’s share price was driven not only by the positive change in sentiment toward bitcoin and cryptocurrencies resulting from the prospect of the world’s largest asset manager playing a prominent role in the space, but also by the fact that the company was designated as the provider of custody for the fund,” analysts led by Mark Palmer wrote.  However, investors looking at the crypto exchange's shares as a play on increasing institutional adoption of digital assets should first consider the risks the company is facing that could trigger a reversal of the stock’s recent gains, the report said.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it was suing Coinbase earlier this month, accusing it of violating federal securities law. The same day, a task force of 10 U.S. state regulators said it was coming after the firm, alleging it violated state securities laws by offering its staking program to residents.  Berenberg notes that the potential cease and desist orders on Coinbase’s staking rewards program are looming. The deadline is July 4, and the bank says it is highly unlikely Coinbase will be able to convince the states that their concerns are misplaced. Staking represented 9.5% of Coinbase’s net revenue in first-quarter 2023.  The downside from the loss of potential revenue from the staking rewards program is much larger than the potential upside from the firm’s role as custody provider for Blackrock’s planned spot bitcoin ETF, the note said.  The SEC could still target the USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin as an unregistered security, which would “jeopardize the significant amount of revenue that Coinbase generates from its portion of the interest income earned on the assets backing the stablecoin,” the report added.  The bank has a hold rating on the stock with a $39 price target. The shares closed at $72.43 on Thursday.

42410248,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcwelU,1688122676,Bitcoin Steady Near $31K After Options Expiry; Dollar Index Rises Before Key U.S. Inflation Data,"Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) kept trading within recent price ranges as the expiry of quarterly options and a strengthening dollar index failed to unsettle investors.  At 08:00 UTC, around 150,000 BTC options contracts, worth around $4.5 billion, and 1.2 million ether contracts, worth $2.3 billion, expired on Deribit, the world's leading crypto options exchange. Deribit controls over 85% of global crypto options activity.  The expiry was pivotal, considering market makers in BTC options were ""long gamma"" and could have added to spot price moves with their hedging activities. The largest cryptocurrency by market value, however, traded listlessly between $30,000 and $31,000 in days leading up to the settlement and remained locked in the narrow range afterward, recording just a 1% gain on the day to $30,700 as of 10:40 UTC, CoinDesk data show.  The so-called max pain point for the June bitcoin options was $26,500. That is the level at which option buyers stand to lose the most at expiration.  Popular theory says the price acts as a magnet in the lead-up to the expiration, with option sellers – usually large traders – trying to push prices to that level to inflict maximum loss on buyers. During the bull market of late 2020 and early 2021, bitcoin consistently gravitated toward max pain point ahead of expiries and resumed gains after the settlement.  With the expiry over, the magnet is gone. So, the cryptocurrencies could resume their upward journies if other factors stay unchanged.  ""BTC Max Pain at a significantly reduced level of $26.5K might alleviate the prevailing downward pressure on prices following the expiration,"" said Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer at Deribit.  The max pain point for ether June expiry options was $1,700. The native token of Ethereum changed hands at about $1,900 at press time, a 2% gain on the day and the biggest increase in more than a week.  Dollar gains ahead of Core PCE  The dollar index (DXY), which tracks the U.S. currency's value against major peers, including the euro, clocked a two-week high of 103.50 before press time, extending a two-day winning streak triggered by upbeat economic data releases. Notably, the weekly jobless claims figure released Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week by the most in 20 months.  On Friday, at 12:30 UTC, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis will release the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of price pressures, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, or the core PCE deflator.  The data is likely to show the core elements of inflation remain stubborn, strengthening the case for higher-for-longer interest rates in the U.S. and adding to the dollar's strength.  According to economists surveyed by FactSet and published by Barron's, the index is likely to have risen 0.4% month over month in May after April's 0.38% rise. The gain is forecast at 4.7% year on year, unchanged from the previous month.  A rally in DXY typically leads to financial tightening worldwide and risk aversion in markets. However, losses in bitcoin may be moderate this time or short-lived, as the recent spot BTC ETF filings by BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity have buoyed the crypto market sentiment.  Traders may also take cues from the U.S. personal spending and income figures, which will hit the wires along with the core PCE reading.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/30/bitcoin-steady-near-31k-after-options-expiry-dollar-index-rises-ahead-of-key-us-inflation-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ddedb1bb1928541944f189d26c92070a216fdae6-1732x1083.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Another setback Still the largest crypto exchange in the world by trading volume, Binance is continuing to labour into strong headwinds, suffering regulatory pushback in some European countries, and of course currently being sued by the US regulator. The latest setback for Binance was reported by the German-based Finance Fwd website. The article stated that the BaFin regulator had either officially denied a crypto custody licence application, or had verbally notified Binance that its licence had been rejected. A spokesperson for Binance was quoted as saying: “Even if we cannot share details of our discussions with the regulators, we will continue to work to meet Bafin's requirements. It is an ongoing process” They added: “We are confident that we have the right team and the appropriate measures to continue our discussions with the regulatory authorities in Germany.“ The rejection in Germany will be a difficult pill to swallow for Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ. The ongoing defence of his company and him personally in the US is a weight around the neck of the crypto exchange. Battlegrounds need to be won With such a globally important regulator as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accusing CZ of embezzlement of customer funds among other allegations, obtaining regulatory licences in other countries is going to be difficult, at least until it is known how the accusations are likely to pan out. Given that Binance is such an important exchange in the crypto ecosystem many may be hoping that it is able to resist the SEC. Both Binance and Coinbase are very important battlegrounds that need to be fought and won if the crypto industry is to reinject some momentum into the beleaguered asset class.

Mooky will be a community-driven platform whose governance lies in the hands of its token holders. While the MOOKY token draws its cues from other successful memecoins, the project has a more ambitious mandate. Mooky was conceived to increase awareness of global environmental challenges and to provide real-world solutions. The project aims to raise enough funds to sustain an extensive reforestation initiative in key locations around the world. As part of its commitment to nature, Mooky has earmarked donations to charities working on sustainable environmental causes. From a crypto-economic perspective, the MOOKY token features zero tax and low slippage, providing ample incentives for traders to get involved. Underpinning the project is a deep lore that aligns with Mooky’s core goals. Mooky is based on the concept of a mythical land called Pygmy. This fantastical realm has stunning landscapes, abundant vegetation, and wildlife. As settlers came to the island, they destroyed the vegetation and polluted the air. The monkeys of Pygmy decide to fight back peacefully, teaching the settlers how to respect nature and live harmoniously. Under the leadership of Mooky, they become united and restore nature. To support the project’s development while providing greater opportunities for community participation, Mooky has created a collection of 1,000 NFTs. Each NFT is linked to a tree planted in the real world. Holders can access the Ventures Club, which grants access to exclusive rewards and events. With five days left in the $MOOKY token presale, there is still ample opportunity for crypto holders to get involved and capture the upside to a project that combines memes and nature to great effect.

MOOKY also stands as a symbol of creativity in the digital space, offering unique 3D NFTs that are each linked to real-world tree-planting initiatives.

Amid a 12% drop in XRP’s price between June 22 and June 28, they instead saw an opportunity rather than a setback, amassing 360 million XRP worth approximately $170 million. This significant investment demonstrates the high-stake moves that define the crypto markets. While such large-scale purchases are not unusual in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, this particular accumulation of XRP seems to suggest a confident long-term outlook on the asset by these whales, despite the current bearish trend. #Ripple whales bought the dip! While the price of #XRP dropped 12% from June 22 to June 28, whales bought 360 million $XRP worth nearly $170 million. pic.twitter.com/QI0m45cIio — Ali (@ali_charts) June 29, 2023 XRP Whale Movements Amid Market Fluctuations On June 22, XRP’s price hit a weekly high of $0.52. But this peak didn’t last long. The subsequent reversal led to a drop, triggering increased profit-taking as many felt the asset was overvalued. Related Reading: ‘Ripple (XRP) Is A Must-Hold For The Next Bull Run,’ Says Bitcoin Maxi Consequently, XRP has been on a downward slope, breaking key support levels, and presently trades below the earlier $0.5 mark. This puts the asset’s decline at around 4.3% for the past week. However, the picture is not all gloom and doom. The market capitalization of XRP sits at $24.8 billion, making it the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. This ranking comes even amid the notable downward pressure. Despite the past week’s bearish trend, the last 24 hours have shown some signs of recovery for XRP. The token has experienced a slight uptick, gaining 2.1% in price. This positive movement has bolstered the asset’s market cap by over $500 million, pushing it up from just below $24 billion earlier this month to the current $24.8 billion. Even so, XRP’s daily trading volume has experienced a significant fall, dropping from the $1 billion mark seen earlier this month to below $600 million in the last 24 hours. The token’s price has remained somewhat stable, with a 24-hour low of $0.46 and a high of $0.47. Effect On The Market While the whales’ massive XRP purchase is newsworthy, it’s not the only factor at play. The modest price uptrend could be attributed to an overall slight bullish sentiment reverberating throughout the broader cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin, the front-runner in the crypto space, has also displayed a minor upward trend, which typically influences the performance of other digital assets, including XRP. In this volatile world of cryptocurrencies, it’s crucial to keep an eye on such significant moves as the ones made by the whales. Their actions could set the stage for what’s next for XRP and other cryptocurrencies in the weeks and months to come. Ripple Labs has actively sought to have the Security and Executive Commission (SEC) lawsuit against it dismissed, asserting that XRP, unlike conventional securities, operates as a digital currency due to its practical use and decentralized features. The company is challenging the SEC’s authority in this regard and condemns the regulatory body for not offering clear guidance on the status of XRP as a security. Related Reading: XRP Price Topside Bias Vulnerable Unless It Climbs Above $0.50 Ripple claims that the ongoing legal dispute has adversely affected XRP holders and stifled progress in the cryptocurrency sector. The court’s ruling on Ripple’s request for dismissal is eagerly awaited, and it could substantially impact the trajectory of the lawsuit. Should the request be granted, it could significantly undermine the SEC’s case, but if denied, the legal battle will continue with the SEC’s charges against Ripple remaining active.

The declining inflows of stablecoins on the Arbitrum network have raised concerns among investors and enthusiasts alike, as it signals potential obstacles for the growth and development of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. As a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, Arbitrum initially garnered significant attention and saw impressive gains, but recent hurdles have dampened the optimism surrounding its future prospects. While the decline in stablecoin inflows is a cause for worry, there are potential avenues for growth that could help revive Arbitrum’s momentum. Source: Coingecko Resilient Growth Amidst Volatility: ARB Performance Despite facing market volatility, both the Arbitrum protocol and its native token, ARB, have demonstrated remarkable growth. CoinGecko reports ARB’s current price at $1.14, showcasing a 0.9% rally over the past 24 hours and an encouraging seven-day gain of 3.3%. Related Reading: Solana Makes A Comeback: 15% Rally Signals Renewed Momentum However, a recent ARB report highlights a notable decline in stablecoin inflows on the Arbitrum platform, raising concerns about its potential impact on the protocol’s growth trajectory. The decrease in stablecoin inflows may also impact the protocol’s overall liquidity. Less stablecoins entering circulation may reduce liquidity in the market. Source: DeFiLlama Such a decline could also indicate a waning demand for stablecoin-based activities within the protocol, potentially affecting its position within the DeFi sector. A Path To Growth For Arbitrum Arbitrum recognizes the potential for expansion by engaging in collaboration within the gaming sector, aiming to attract a larger user base and enhance the Total Value Locked (TVL) on its protocol. Recent developments indicate that Reboot Protocol, in a tweet, has announced its partnership with pixelvaut to launch its flagship game on the Arbitrum network. These strategic alliances have the potential to act as catalysts for growth, offering a promising avenue to counterbalance the decline in stablecoin inflows. Exciting to see the #BattlePlan game on #ArbitrumNova 🧡💙 A launch by @rebootgg_ @pixelvault_ Welcome to the ecosystem 🙌 https://t.co/qCubAO8DYu — Arbitrum (💙,🧡) (@arbitrum) June 28, 2023 By capitalizing on collaborations in the gaming sector, Arbitrum seeks to tap into the ever-growing demand for decentralized applications (dApps) and virtual experiences. Related Reading: Dogecoin Faces Downward Pressure – Will DOGE Bulls Avert A Further Slide? Integrating games and related platforms onto the Arbitrum network could attract a new wave of users, expanding the ecosystem and bolstering the TVL. Moreover, such partnerships can contribute to creating a vibrant and diverse DeFi ecosystem on Arbitrum, offsetting the impact of declining stablecoin inflows. Total market cap of cryptocurrencies nearly unchanged at $1.15 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com Despite facing challenges, Arbitrum remains resilient in its price performance, demonstrating growth in both its protocol and ARB token. The decline in stablecoin inflows serves as a call to action for the platform to explore alternative avenues for growth, such as the collaboration in the gaming sector.

Members of the Slovak Republic’s National Council, or parliament, voted to approve an amendment that would lower cryptocurrency taxes, along with other measures that would affect crypto holders. Crypto Income Tax Reduced to 7% Bloomberg Law reports that Slovakia’s National Council voted in favour of reducing personal income tax on profits derived from the sale of crypto held by a user for at least one year. As it stands, cryptocurrency profits are taxed on a sliding scale of either 19% or 25%. The approved amendment will see taxes lowered significantly to 7%. The amendment further declares payments received in cryptocurrencies up to 2,400 euros, or $2,600, will not be taxed. Additionally, the bill excludes cryptocurrency income from a health insurance contribution of 14%. Slovakia Will Lose 30 Million Euro Through Tax Cuts The newly amended tax policy comes only weeks after parliament passed a constitutional amendment that codifies citizens’ right to use cash as payment. The amendment was made due to talk about a digital euro. According to a local Slovakian media outlet, the Ministry of Finance estimates it will lose around 30 million euros annually due to the tax cut. US Lags as Europe Makes Regulatory Strides Slovakia, as one of the 27 member states of the European Union (EU), has been promoting cryptocurrency regulations across the region. The EU voted in favour of its landmark MiCA bill, which will make Europe a hub for digital assets. The bill will take effect in 2024. The UK also made a significant step toward its crypto goal. The House of Lords voted to enact the Financial Services and Markets Bill, which will see cryptocurrencies become a “regulated activity.” While Europe, Hong Kong, Singapore and even Dubai compete for their share in the booming crypto market, the situation is less than ideal in the US. With full backing from the Biden administration, the SEC drives the industry away from its shores and ultimately into the arms of those who embrace it.

14347207,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540483,1688116848,"Bitcoin Price Stalls Below $31,000, Is The Best Time To Buy Next Monday?","The Bitcoin and crypto market eagerly observed the expiry of the quarterly BTC and ETH options today (at 8:00 am UTC / 4:00 am EST). It was the second largest in history with a volume of 159,000 BTC options and 1.25 million ETH options with a total value of almost $7 billion. The market was expecting a sharp increase in volatility, but it failed to materialize. In the run-up, the BTC price briefly spiked as high as $31,300 before seeing a pullback towards $30,700. The event has thus pretty much become a nothing burger. Options analysts at Greeks.Live confirmed a few minutes ago that the quarterly expiration has been completed, with more BTC block calls being traded in the last few days, mainly to close and roll positions at the end of the quarter, with ETH being mainly in the order book, adding: With the quarterly expiry, the market has seen a release of positions that have built up in recent months, and options could see a larger shift if the market supports it in July. Although volatility levels have risen this month and market makers are happy to actively buy positions, the downward trend in major term IV is very much in evidence amidst the strong selling pressure from quarterly delivery. What’s Next For Bitcoin? Today’s daily close could become extremely important for the Bitcoin price. Today is month-end, quarter-end and the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index, the US Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, will be released at 8:30 am EST (12:30 pm CET). On Tuesday, the U.S. market is closed for the Fourth of July, Independence Day. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Key Indicators Suggest A Strengthening Case For Rally To $32K The Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index is preferred by the Fed because it provides broader coverage of consumer spending, includes chain weighting to accurately track behavioral changes, accounts for the substitution effect, and uses comprehensive data sources. The PCE is therefore considered a more flexible and representative indicator of inflation compared to other indexes such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI). While headline CPI data have looked extremely good in recent months, core inflation has been shown to be very sticky. A lot of focus today will therefore be on core PCE. The expectation for PCE inflation is 3.9% and for core PCE 4.7% year-over-year. A surprise to the downside has the potential to provide a bullish boost to both the traditional financial market as well as the Bitcoin and crypto markets. Related Reading: Dawn For Bitcoin: $5 Billion In Options Expire And Could Push Price Towards $31,000 As renowned analyst @rektcapital writes via Twitter, BTC is positioning itself for a monthly close above a resistance that had rejected the price for the past three months. Currently, BTC is holding above the same level (black). Thus, the monthly as well as the quarterly close could be an extremely bullish harbinger for July. Is The Best Time To Buy Next Monday? Analyst @tedtalksmacro recently published an analysis about Bitcoin’s historical performance via Twitter. The result may suggest that the upcoming Monday, July 3, is the best option for a Bitcoin buy, at least historically. As the analyst noted, July has been the best performing month since October 2009. However, the data is skewed due to a 10x in July 2010. Taking only the last five years of data, the best performing month is October, closely followed by July. On a weekly basis, Mondays are the best day to buy and hold BTC. This assumes that buyers do not hold BTC on any day other than the nominated one, as the analyst evaluated. At press time, the Bitcoin price hovered below the $31,000 resistance zone, trading at $30,856.

14345288,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/former-first-lady-melania-trump-launches-new-nft-collection,1688111760,Former First Lady Melania Trump Launches New NFT Collection,"Melania Trump, the former first lady of the United States, has launched a new NFT collection to celebrate the country’s Independence Day, inspired by the nation’s iconic landmarks. The collection, called “The 1776 Collection,” consists of a six-piece range of NFTs consisting of images sourced from across the United States of America. Trump Family NFTs Make A Comeback The Trump family is back in the NFT space with the launch of Melania Trump’s new NFT collection inspired by the upcoming Independence Day holiday. The launch of the new collection comes only a couple of months after former president Donald Trump released the second set of his NFT trading cards. The new set of collectibles launched by the former first lady is part of “The 1776 Collection.” The NFTs are based on the Solana blockchain and feature several iconic images, including prominent landmarks such as Mount Rushmore and the Statue of Liberty, affixed to animated placards. Each NFT is priced at $50, with the collection comprising seven different designs, making up a total of 3500 NFTs. The NFTs can be purchased through a website called USA Collectibles, with Melania Trump retweeting the company’s original tweet about the NFT collection going on sale. The USA Collectibles website also offers POTUS TRUMP NFTs, which feature photos of former President Trump and the former first lady. Melania Trump stated, “The 1776 Collection of artwork draws inspiration from several iconic landmarks of our nation, which I had the privilege of visiting during the time I served as first lady. Each piece provides a view into our nation’s history, culture, and patriotism. I am proud to celebrate our great nation and remain inspired by the words contained within the Declaration of Independence.” The collection went live on the 29th of July. Portion Of Proceeds To Benefit Foster Kids According to reports, a portion of all proceeds from the collection will go towards Fostering The Future, an initiative by BeBest. The initiative helps children in the foster care community secure educational opportunities and scholarships. Primarily, the Fostering the Future initiative aims to grant computer science scholarships to children coming out of the foster care system, helping them achieve the academic foundation needed to secure technology-based jobs. The former first lady also added that her commitment towards the foster community has grown stronger since leaving Washington DC. Melania Trump also added that she supports former President Trump’s reelection campaign and looks forward to working with him once again and restoring hope for the future and leading America. She stated that if she could serve as the first lady again, she would continue to prioritize initiatives that focus on the well-being and development of children, ensuring that they reach their full potential. The Trumps And NFTs The Trumps have considerable history in the NFT ecosystem going back at least a couple of years. It was Melania Trump who first jumped into the NFT space with the release of her first NFT in December 2021. The NFT was also based on the Solana blockchain. However, Solana Labs, the entity behind the Solana blockchain, clarified that it was not a Solana-led initiative. The former first lady released more NFTs in 2022 before former president Donald Trump released his popular digital trading cards collection, consisting of around 45,000 NFTs. The collection was launched on Polygon, an Ethereum scaling solution, and each NFT was priced at $99. Furthermore, each NFT in the collection was tied to special perks, such as a potential dinner with the ex-president. While the collection was widely ridiculed, it sold out within 24 hours and became the talk of the NFT space, causing their resale value to surge. At the peak of their popularity, the cards were starting at a price of over $1000 on secondary marketplaces. The former president then released a second collection, consisting of 47,000 NFTs, causing the original NFTs’ price to fall considerably. At present, the original Trump NFTs start at around $185, while NFTs from the second collection start at approximately $54. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

14345011,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540460,1688111178,Never Skip A Korea Pump? Bitcoin Cash Soars 168% in 10 Days,"The Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price has gone through the roof in recent days. Within the last ten days, the Bitcoin fork has risen by a staggering 168%, temporarily BCH was already up over 200% today. While Bitcoin Cash was still trading at $104 on June 20 and was stuck in a deep bull market that looked bad even compared to other altcoins, a miracle occurred 10 days ago. The price exploded out of nowhere. Why Is Bitcoin Cash Experiencing A Revival? As NewsBTC reported, the reasons for the phenomenal rise in BCH’s price have already been discussed hotly over the past few days. It was often heard that the listing on the new crypto exchange EDX Markets, which is backed by industry giants Citadel Securities, Charles Schwab Corp. and Fidelity Digital Assets, favored BCH. Furthermore, it has been argued that the price increase is also due to Bitcoin Cash’s recent “game-changing” upgrade. In mid-May, Bitcoin Cash underwent a hard fork that not only improved the network’s security and privacy measures, but also introduced plans for CashTokens. However, the real reasons for the current Bitcoin Cash pump seem to lie elsewhere: namely in South Korea. Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu reports today that South Korea could be the reason for the BCH pump, looking at where much of the trading volume originates. Related Reading: Kaching! Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Explodes Over 100% – What’s Powering It? In the last 24 hours, the largest exchange in South Korea, Upbit, recorded over $350 million in trading volume for BCH/KRW, accounting for 23.58% of the total trading volume for BCH. Moreover, it is also three times the trading volume of BTC/KRW on Upbit – an anomaly that has extreme rarity. Renowned crypto whale and trader Andrew Kang agrees, stating that the current BCH rally reminds him of the multi-week Aptos (APT) battle between Korean retailers and “professional traders.” Never Skip A Korea Pump? “Koreans didn’t need a reason to bid, all that mattered is that it kept going up and early bears got slaughtered,” Kang said. The trader is alluding to APT’s 500% rally earlier this year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash Surges 20% In One Day As Market Rebounds, What’s Next? South Koreans pumped Aptos because of a joke about housing affordability. APT’s trading volume on the South Korean crypto exchange UpBit was often higher than the total trading volume on Binance at the time. It was also beneficial that the Aptos Foundation marketed the altcoin to Koreans from day one. According to Alex Shin, co-founder of crypto venture capital firm Hashed, South Korean crypto investors took Aptos’ three-letter ticker “APT” and turned it into a meme alluding to how absurdly expensive it is to buy an “apartment” in South Korea. Asia expert Wu said at the time that “pumping altcoins is a tradition in the Korean community.” Kang concluded: “People are shorting more BCH than there is liquid supply of it. It’s highly illiquid since most of the supply is dead. Imagine fading the original cartel” and added “disbelief pump.” At press time, BCH changed hands for $300 per coin.

The cryptocurrency has jumped over 30% in the past 24 hours to a 14-month high of $320, taking the cumulative gain since EDX's debut on June 20 to 183%, CoinDesk data show.  The latest price surge is backed by a notable increase in trading activity on South Korea's most prominent digital assets exchange Upbit.  Data tracked by Coingecko show, the bitcoin cash-Korean won (BCH/KRW) pair listed on Upbit has registered a trading volume of $557.63 million in the past 24 hours. That's nearly 3.5 times bigger than the volume of $160 million in Upbit's BTC/KRW pair and 5.5 times the BCH/USD volume of $87 million on the Nasdaq-listed Coinbase exchange.  The data shows the enthusiasm generated from BCH being offered by an exchange backed by prominent institutions has reached the far east.

The date for the hearing is now much earlier than expected, prompted by a ""creative"" defense tactic employed by Coinbase, where in the exchange filed its first response 40 days before the deadline of August 7.  According to the rules, the SEC had to file a response to Coinbase's defense by July 3. The SEC asked for an extension of three business days owing to the July 4 holiday weekend, which was granted by the court.  Additionally, the court converted the pre-trial conference to a pre-motion conference and pushed it forward to July 13 at 14:00 UTC from August 24. A pre-motion conference is an application made by the prosecutor or defense attorney, requesting the court make a decision on a certain issue before the trial.  In response to the SEC’s complaint, Coinbase has argued that many of the tokens highlighted in the SEC’s case fall outside the Commission’s purview.  Coinbase used creative defence strategy  “Coinbase has answered the SEC’s complaint with numerous defenses, including that this action violates due process and constitutes an abuse of discretion. But there is a more fundamental problem with the SEC’s case— one that the Chair recognized two years ago and that entitles Coinbase to judgment on the pleadings now: The subject matter falls outside the SEC’s authority,” Coinbase’s counsel said in a recent letter to the court.  The exchange's tactic to advance the case via a motion for judgment on the pleadings by filing its response 40 days early is not seen as unusual in cases like this but is a ""creative strategy,” one legal expert said. The exchange's move is designed to “get documents helpful to its cause in front of the Judge through the Answer,” said MetaLawman, a lawyer and Twitter legal commentator in a tweet thread.  “On a motion to dismiss, a judge may only consider the factual allegations in the Complaint and any documents attached to, or referenced in, the Complaint--nothing else,” explained MetaLawMan. “On a motion for judgment on the pleadings, by contrast, a judge may consider other pleadings filed in the case, which would include the defendant’s Answer to the Complaint.”  Coinbase did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for further comment.  During the court appearance on July 13, Judge Katherine Polk Failla will determine if Coinbase will be allowed to proceed with this motion.  “This is typically a formality, and permission is granted unless there is some very good reason offered by the other side,” said MetaLawMan.

Dubbed ""Tradelink,"" this new trading and settlement network technology is set to revolutionize the landscape for asset managers, custodians, and exchanges/OTC. Aiming to streamline operations and boost efficiency, Tradelink will allow trading on multiple exchanges without the need for on-chain liquidity re-balancing. This will ensure that users maintain custodial ownership of assets while engaging in off-exchange trading. Additionally, Tradelink seeks to mitigate trading collateral risks across various third-party platforms, offer easy integration with preferred counter-parties, and significantly reduce transaction fees. The company’s official announcement stated: ""Today, we are proud to announce that Ledger is entering the institutional trading technology market with the first open network to enable custodial trading via exchange and custodial partners. This solution will provide unparalleled control, security, flexibility, and transparent governance over an enterprise’s digital asset trading."" Ledger's VP of Enterprise Revenue, Sebastien Badault, emphasizes how Tradelink will empower users, asserting: “By unlocking better trading options for enterprises, we are empowering asset managers, custodians, and exchanges to navigate the changing landscape with confidence while making the whole ecosystem a safer and more transparent place.” At launch, Tradelink will be accessible to all Ledger Enterprise clients at no additional cost. Initial partners will include well-known asset managers such as Laser Digital and Hodl Group, digital asset trading and orchestration platforms like Wyden, and platform partners including Crypto.com, Bitstamp, Huobi, and more. The launch of Tradelink comes after Ledger's recent controversial update, which raised security concerns among its users. However, the company remains undeterred and has just closed a $109 Million Series C extension fundraising round, pushing its valuation to $1.4 billion. Badault further elaborates on the company's vision for Tradelink: “We are creating a future-proof solution that will give Ledger Enterprise customers flexibility and security allowing institutions to de-risk their businesses. For almost a decade, Ledger has been building security and governance solutions for the crypto ecosystem. It is this core security foundation that can now be used to reduce counterparty risk and enable custodial trading for institutional investors.” Ledger’s innovative Trading Operation technology, coupled with its commitment to transparency and regulatory compliance, positions the company at the forefront of an increasingly evolving market, navigating the ever-changing regulatory and overall market landscape with confidence.

Altman's innovative venture aims to offer a global, financial identity to citizens around the globe. Worldcoin's open-source protocol, backed by a network of developers, economists, and engineers, is designed to foster collective ownership worldwide, enabling equal access regardless of class or economic status. Utilizing an iris scanning device, the World ID, Worldcoin aims to ensure secure access to several Web2 platforms while combating the issue of bots impersonating genuine users. Notably, the Worldcoin ecosystem also comprises the WorldApp payments network, promoting financial inclusion by facilitating cryptocurrency transactions. As part of its dedication to the significant challenges of the web3 world, Worldcoin supports the Optimism Collective, an initiative aiming to enhance Ethereum's scalability by reducing transaction costs. Worldcoin Collaborates with Auth0 for ID Verification The crypto project has announced the launch of the ""Sign in with Worldcoin"" feature in Berlin, which uses the World ID biometric scanning system. This function is also set to be integrated with the Auth0 marketplace, the world's largest provider of digital identity solutions. The “Sign in with Worldcoin” feature, based on zero-knowledge cryptographic proofs, will help users verify their digital identities while maintaining their privacy. This approach eliminates the risk of user data being shared with third-party services without consent, ensuring that all World ID-registered users are real people. Auth0's services offer an alternative way for Worldcoin developers to create financial solutions tailored to a broad spectrum of individuals. Worldcoin's innovations introduce an effective measure against the spread of bots within virtual environments, a problem estimated to cause digital advertising fraud amounting to $100 billion worldwide by 2023. Mysterious Safe Deployments Linked to Worldcoin In other news, Worldcoin recently confirmed its role behind a series of Safe deployments to the Optimism network. A Safe, previously known as “Gnosis Safe”, is a multisignature smart contract wallet, widely used by development teams for added security in transactions. A social media post from Tiago Sada, head of product for Worldcoin developer Tools for Humanity, revealed Worldcoin was behind the Safe deployments. Initially, these transactions led to speculation, including concerns about a possible Sybil attack or address-farming technique to profit from misdirected coins. Worldcoin, which extensively uses Safes to offer gas-free transactions to verified humans, recently announced it was migrating its app from Polygon to Optimism. This migration seemed to be the cause behind the deployment of numerous Safes, reassuring the community that the network was not under any form of attack.

However, things in the crypto industry change rapidly, so you can never rely on only one coin. Tradecurve (TCRV) recently entered the cryptocurrency world, and although still in presale, it already faces an 80% price increase. Therefore, experts estimate that once Tradecurve (TCRV) tokens reach reputable exchanges, they can surge by 100x. >>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW Chainlink (LINK) Price Predictions After establishing a partnership with Stella in order to secure its DeFi strategies, Chainlink (LINK) rebounded on a bullish run. But that didn’t last for too long. In the last 24 hours, Chainlink (LINK) decreased by 0.79%, currently standing at $6.09. The main reason for its price decline is Golteum’s joining the Chainlink (LINK) BUILD program, which significantly pressures the Chainlink (LINK) coin. However, this should leverage the Chainlink (LINK) industry-leading technology and provide investors with secure, efficient, and transparent trading options. On a more positive note, experts believe that Chainlink (LINK) will have a positive price movement in the upcoming period if this collaboration proves to work. Additionally, ChatGPT has bright expectations about the coin as well. It forecasts that Chainlink (LINK) will reach $12 if the tokens’ supply remains constant. The past few weeks have been amazing for the #Tradecurve project and community. 💎 We have over 12,000 users who have signed up for the presale, 4,400 holders, and have raised over $2.7 million. 🔥 For a LIMITED time only, the team is offering a 50% deposit bonus. 👉🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/CCwI4aICZr — Tradecurve (@Tradecurveapp) June 26, 2023 Tradecurve (TCRV) Brings Waves to the Crypto Industry Tradecurve (TCRV) is a new project representing a decentralized platform that offers numerous trading options from a single account. More precisely, you can trade cryptocurrencies, CFDs, forex, options, commodities, EFTs, indices, and bonds. Due to combining all of these options in one platform, Tradecurve (TCRV) is the first project to offer something like this. With Tradecurve (TCRV), you can enjoy total anonymity because the platform doesn’t implement the lengthy KYC verification method. Also, Tradecurve has some pretty amazing benefits for investors. For instance, you can utilize copy trading that helps you implement successful traders’ techniques, high leverage starting at 500:1, and AI algorithmic or automatic trading. All you need to do is put crypto as a deposit and enjoy. But Tradecurve (TCRV) doesn’t stop here. The platform is considering developing a metaverse trading academy that will help less experienced traders connect with industry experts and learn their strategies. However, the main reason why Tradecurve (TCRV) draws so much attention is its native TCRV tokens that have faced an 80% price increase while still in presale. You can purchase the TCRV tokens for $0.018. In addition, Tradecurve has already raised $2.8 million from its goal of $20 million, which puts it in a great position to compete with the industry’s giants – Binance and Kraken.

Can QUBE 10x?,"Most crypto enthusiasts are familiar with older crypto giants that have made a lot of money for investors since their introduction to the crypto market. While these crypto giants have created a lot of profit for investors, it has become necessary for investors to seek out new DeFi projects to earn money from. Thankfully, new crypto projects with viable utilities are constantly added to the market, giving investors more options. InQubeta (QUBE) is one of the latest crypto projects whose presale has already made money for investors after its Beta stage. InQubeta's presale indicates it could be more profitable than an older crypto giant like Cardano (ADA). More investors are putting their money into InQubeta to increase their profit margins in the coming months. InQubeta's (QUBE) Presale Forges Ahead in the Crypto Market InQubeta has successfully launched a presale that crypto enthusiasts are eager to participate in. With an ecosystem designed to offer an easy pathway to the AI market, InQubeta is slowly gaining the trust of reputable crypto investors. InQubeta's presale has recorded unprecedented success in the crypto market, increasing investors' chances of becoming wealthy through this project. The QUBE token presale is divided into 10 stages, and each stage has an allocated number of tokens to be sold at a different price. The price of QUBE increases at the beginning of a new presale stage, ensuring the token's value grows as the presale progresses. The first presale stage, the Beta stage, was recently completed, pushing QUBE into its second presale phase, Stage 1. The DeFi coin price of QUBE in its current stage is $0.00875, and there are 100,000,000 QUBE tokens to be sold. InQubeta's presale has raised over $600,000, and it will only raise more before the presale stages are complete. In the next stage, QUBE will be sold for $0.0098, drawing closer to its launch price of $0.0308. InQubeta is one of the most profitable new DeFi projects, as its presale also features bonuses for investors. Once the presale ends, InQubeta's ability to link AI startups and investors will make it even more popular among investors. With an NFT marketplace that allows AI startups to connect with potential investors, InQubeta is set to become one of the best DeFi projects the crypto market has ever seen. InQubeta's NFT marketplace is built on the Ethereum blockchain, increasing its credibility and efficiency. All transactions within InQubeta are paid for using the QUBE token. This increases the token's value, solidifying InQubeta's position as an excellent project to add to your portfolio in 2023. As more investors notice InQubeta's value, its DeFi coin price is only likely to increase, making it an excellent investment option for the future. Some believe it could 10x by the end of the year, and it definitely has all the key components of a crypto that could explode in value. Cardano (ADA) Maintains its Position as a Crypto Giant Cardano was created using a research-based approach to crypto development. The crypto giant is one of the most popular blockchains for developers to build decentralized applications (dApps). It also offers a highly sustainable network with increased transaction processing speeds. Cardano seeks to build a network that is not limited by bandwidth, promising a wider reach for blockchain developers in the crypto market. Cardano has remained one of the most profitable cryptocurrencies since it was launched. Its native token, ADA, runs operations on the platform. Conclusion Cardano is one of the best DeFi projects in the crypto market; however, investors are looking for new cryptos to diversify their portfolios. InQubeta's presale has created a more profitable opportunity for investors to earn more money. This is why InQubeta's presale is selling out fast and gaining momentum among investors. The QUBE token may be the most profitable crypto token of 2023. Its ecosystem promises to give investors better investment opportunities that will increase the value of their holdings. Investing in its presale now is a great way to ensure you are not left out when InQubeta's price rises. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $30,400, up 0.6% over the previous 24 hours.  Fidelity joined Blackstone, Invesco and WisdomTree, who have filed spot BTC ETF applications with the SEC over the past two weeks. These initiatives have buoyed investors and sent crypto prices higher.  “What’s striking to observe is how the digital asset industry continues to rebound from negative news,"" CJ Reim, co-founder and managing partner atventure capital firm Amity Ventures and a contributor to Core DAO, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.

Other major cryptos were largely in the green with SOL, the token of the Solana smart contracts platform, recently soaring more than 14%.  As CoinDesk reported Thursday, crypto traders on the Solana blockchain have been following the example of Ethereum’s “Liquid staking token” (LST) craze by leveraging their SOL token derivatives in pursuit of lofty yields through an obtuse, re-leveraging process. The trend's emergence follows Drift Protocol’s Tuesday release of a new service, known as “Super staking,” which packages the entire cycle into a one-click operation.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets' performance, was recently up 1.2%.  U.S. equity markets largely shrugged off the positive economic data - a revised 2% increase in GDP and decline in weekly jobless claims – that suggested inflation would remain problematic and offered potential support for the Federal Reserve's plans to raise interest rates two more times in 2023. Such monetary hawkishness has repeatedly unsettled asset markets over the past year.  At the Banco de Espana Fourth Conference on Financial Stability, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted central bank uncertainty about the appropriate inflationary medicine in the months ahead, although he has suggested in recent weeks that the Fed would raise rates in upcoming months.  “Nonetheless, inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go,” Powell said, adding: “We see the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest rate–sensitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing and investment. It will take time, however, for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation.”  In an email to CoinDesk, Akash Mahendra, director at Haven1 Foundation and portfolio manager at digital wealth platform Yield App, wrote that while the ""bitcoin ETF frenzy"" was ""good news for bitcoin's price,"" the industry's success would also depend heavily on innovation.  ""Endorsement from large institutions is fantastic, and we do all hope that BlackRock’s ETF goes through – not least because rejection would be very, very bad for bitcoin,"" Mahendra wrote. ""However, at its core, blockchain is really a place for innovation beyond what is available in the traditional finance sector.""

Bitcoin is currently trading at about $30,000.  Yet more than 55% of bitcoin circulating supply has not moved since 2021, and that percentage reflects a 10% decline over the period. Meanwhile, ConDesk's Bitcoin Trend Indicator, another measure of investor sentiment has risen into significant upturn category after spending much of the past few weeks pointed downward.

14336693,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540407,1688090432,Ethereum/Bitcoin Futures Ratio Launch Could Threaten ETH Price? Expert Forecasts,"The two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Ethereum and Bitcoin, slowed down on their rally. Following a surge above critical resistance, the cryptocurrencies could retrace and return to critical support levels. Related Reading: Cardano Shows Signs of Recovery: When Will it Reach $0.30? As of this writing, Ethereum (ETH) trades at $1,840 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, ETH has recorded a 2% loss except for Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL), the crypto top 10 by market cap trades in the red. Trouble Ahead For Ethereum? Earlier today, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) announced the launch of a new product. The platform will roll out an Ethereum (ETH/USD) to Bitcoin (BTC/USD) ratio futures contract. The financial product will follow the price of these cryptocurrencies and their correlation. In that way, traders can gain exposure to both cryptocurrencies by holding a single futures contract. According to an official announcement, The product aims to create more opportunities for traders in the nascent industry. However, in the short term, the CME launch hints at a potential downside for the two largest assets in the crypto market. CME Product Could Trigger This Effect In the past, whenever the CME rolled out a Bitcoin or Ethereum-based contract, the price of either asset trended to the downside. A pseudonym analyst forecasted issues for ETH and BTC, probably driven by a “buy the rumor, sell the news” effect. Via Twitter, the analyst stated, reacting to the news: If this has an effect similar to the $BTC & $ETH futures back in the day then the release of this instrument could form a pivot for the ETH/BTC pair. Maybe more down into the release and then a reversal around the end of July? Let’s see. In response to the forecast, another analyst stated that a “buy the rumor, sell the news effect” will cause ETH’s price to rally into the event. Therefore, ETH could profit as the CME prepares to roll out their new contracts and anticipation around the spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) applications continues. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Battle Against Miners’ $128 Million Move: Is The Bull Run In Danger? The analyst stated: Wouldn’t make more sense a buy the rumor, sell the news event?

14333861,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=540322,1688083235,Litecoin Bull Case Grows Stronger As Hashrate Touches New All Time-High,"Litecoin (LTC) has been one of the most bullish coins for the year 2023 with anticipation around its forthcoming halving event. This has propelled the digital asset toward price increases higher than the market average. And now, once again, the bull case for the digital asset is even stronger as its hashrate has risen rapidly to a new peak. Litecoin Hashrate Touches New All-Time High As the halving event draws closer, more attention is being paid to the Litecoin network. This has led to an increase in the hashrate of the network as more miners are joining the network. Most of the month of June has seen large spikes in hashrate following the rise in the mining difficulty. Related Reading: The Blessing Of July: Can Bitcoin Climb To $36,000 In The Coming Month? The rise in mining difficulty means that it is harder to find a block and as such, miners have to bring more machines online to increase their chances, leading to a spike in the hashrate. And as more miners are brought online, the Litecoin hashrate has touched its highest level yet. According to data from CoinWarz, the Litecoin hashrate reached 958.36 terahashes per second (TH/s), on Wednesday, June 28, 2023. This is a new all-time high for the network whose previous all-time high had data just above 800 TH/s. Litecoin hashrate reaches new all-time high | Source: CoinWarz The hashrate has seen a decline and is now sitting at 735.71 TH/s for the global hashrate. However, the spike points toward a more positive development for its network and its native token LTC. LTC Could Surge Upon Halving Event The Litecoin halving which will cut block rewards down from 12.5 LTC per mined block to 6.25 LTC per mined block is now less than two months away. As halving events have been known to impose a level of scarcity on a digital asset, a surge in the price of LTC is expected as the event draws closer. LTC price sitting above $85 support | Source: LTCUSD on TradingView.com This scarcity would see supply reduce and if demand continues to rise, then LTC is poised to break $100 by the time the halving is done. If this happens, it could also trigger a reasonable rally in the crypto market as positive sentiment and profits from LTC spills over into the rest of the crypto market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investor Sentiment Suggests BTC Rally Is Far From Over Litecoin’s rise in hashrate already shows that miners are preparing for the halving, indicating renewed fate in the digital asset. As the next few weeks leading up to the event roll by, investors can expect LTC to trade in the green despite market bearishness. At the time of writing, LTC is trading at a price of $85.40 per coin, down 3.08% in the past week.
