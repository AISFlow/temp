Boosting sentiment this week was cryptocurrency exchange FTX ( FTT-USD ) discovering more than $5B in liquid assets. ""The lack of recent contagion in the space and risk rebound in broader markets has lifted bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) off its lows to trade at its highest level since the FTX scandal erupted,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst, OANDA.

Overall crypto market cap currently stands at $938.43B, up 3.6% over Thursday, according to CoinMarketCap . FTX Developments Sam Bankman-Fried, disgraced co-founder of FTX, denied allegations that he swindled $8B in customer funds. He earlier pleaded not guilty to eight criminal charges.

Coinbase ( COIN ) also announced another round of job cuts, this time 25% of its staff. However, Binance ( BNB-USD ) appears to be bucking the trend as it plans to grow its headcount by 15%-30% in 2023. Its workforce grew to 8K last year from 3K.

42414693,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBDPlL,1673648717,Crypto Markets Today: Bitcoin Finishes Best Week Since March; Solana’s Bonk Barks,"In the past few weeks, a Shiba inu-themed token took center stage in the Solana ecosystem as sentiment around the blockchain network took a hit in the aftermath of the Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX debacle. CoinDesk's Shaurya Malwa took a closer look at Bonk Inu:  This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Called Bonk Inu, the project with a cute dog holding a bat as a mascot, launched with just a homepage and a “bonk paper” in the final weeks of 2022.  But the lack of clear team information or even a dedicated community channel didn’t deter entrants from punting their hopes: The project’s token, BONK, ran up as much as 3,200% in just three weeks, almost single-handedly inciting activity in the Solana ecosystem, as previously reported.  Bonk Inu is a team of 22 individuals with no singular leader, all of whom were involved in the inception of the project, CoinDesk learned from one of the several developers. All of them have previously built decentralized applications (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFT) and other related products on Solana.  The bonk airdrop – amounting to 50% of its token supply – likely drove massive community interest and instant hype. Some 20% of the total airdrop supply is going to Solana non-fungible token collections – comprising 297,000 individual NFTs – and 10% to Solana-focused artists and collectors. Airdrops refer to an unsolicited distribution of a cryptocurrency token or coin, usually for free, to numerous wallet addresses and are generally used as a tactic to gain users.  Following Solana taking a hit after the FTX’s collapse, the 22 Solana developers wasted no time in distancing themselves from Sam Bankman-Fried’s dirt. They banded together to build a “community coin” – and decided that a dog-themed protocol was the way to go.  The team does not see itself as a dogecoin or shiba inu rival and points out BONK is already different from the gazillions of dog-themed meme coins already on the market.  Token Roundup  Bitcoin (BTC): The largest cryptocurrency by market value held strong at $19,800 Friday, rising 5% for the day and 15.7% for the week – the best weekly performance since March. Consistent with the rally, bitcoin options' ""volatility smile"" shows the demand for out-of-the-money call options – bullish bets at strikes higher than the cryptocurrency's going market price – has increased relative to puts or bearish bets.  Equities closed higher Friday as traders processed big banks’ fourth-quarter earnings reports including from JPMorgan. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) were up 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.  Bitcoin cash (BCH): The BCH price surged nearly 10% at one point Friday as traders assessed the market impact of potential network changes ahead of the Bitcoin Cash protocol’s May hard fork. BCH broke above resistance levels of $108 to as much as $125 in the past 24 hours. It had settled back to $122 as of publication time.  Ether (ETH): The second-largest cryptocurrency was recently trading flat at $1,427. The ether price rose 12.9% over the past week. The Ethereum blockchain's Merge last year turned into a focus of frenzied speculation in crypto markets. Now, digital-asset traders are starting to handicap various market scenarios ahead of Ethereum's next big milestone, known as the “Shanghai hard fork.”  Decentraland (MANA): The native token of metaverse project Decentraland surged Friday as metaverse tokens became the best-performing digital assets since the start of this year. MANA’s price rose 23% to 50 cents at the time of publication. The recent price jump came as Decentraland introduced new features for users.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Crypto Market Analysis: A Fresh Look at Bitcoin Price Charts After Biggest Rally in 9 Months  By Glenn Williams Jr.  From a chart watchers’ perspective, there are two opposing points:  Bitcoin’s rise to $19,000 moves it to a key area of potential new support.  Bitcoin’s rise to $19,000 also moves it to historically overbought levels.  Point one can be seen using the Visible Range Volume Profile tool, which shows BTC moving from one high-volume node area near $16,700 to another high-volume node area near $19,200.  The significance is that areas of high volume imply areas of high price agreement. These areas often serve as levels of support and/or resistance, and help explain why BTC prices were mired between $16,000 and $17,000 for so long.  Point two is illustrated via the BTC’s current Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading of 84. The RSI is a momentum indicator ranging from 0 to 100. Readings of 30 and below imply that an asset is overpriced. By contrast, readings of 70 and above imply that an asset may be overpriced.  BTC’s current reading is its highest reading since January 2021. Since 2018, BTC’s RSI has been higher than 84 just 25 times. This isn’t to say that an asset can’t stay overbought for extended periods. The 91 RSI level reached on Jan 8, 2021, was followed by a 15% increase in price 30 days later. It should be monitored.

42417072,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpObl,1673644344,There Will Be No Lessons Learned From FTX,"As a new year gets underway I know that I don’t need to buy anything for the crypto-skeptic in my life. As an industry we’ve already bought them, at a cost of billions of dollars, a gift that’s genuinely priceless and always in style: the smug self-satisfaction of knowing they were always right.  After all that happened in 2022, it would be nice to know that we’re busy learning all the right and important lessons. Don’t count on it. Thanks to the miracle of confirmation bias, those advocating proof of reserves, auditing or just the end of the crypto will see the events of the year as confirmation that we need to do whatever it was they were already pitching. I’m no exception: ya’ll need more audits.  Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 package.  As for myself, I write this in a dark mood not because exchanges and hedge funds have collapsed, nor because bad people are going free, having fully apologized on Twitter, and I’m not frustrated by the possibility that caution by customers and regulators could slow the growth of this amazing technology. No indeed. What I’m frustrated with is the slow progress of public blockchains, privacy technology and industrial applications. There’s so much more to blockchain than crypto and we’re just not getting there fast enough.  As we move forward I see three challenges that we should have progressed past but somehow haven’t managed to do. The first is the blockchain program of speed-running the history of financial regulation by making all the mistakes and skipping any useful lessons that former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke may have learned, and for which he won a Nobel Prize. Over and over again we have seen compelling evidence that poorly regulated or unregulated financial entities are at risk for bank runs and that financial services pose systemic risks to the rest of the economic ecosystem.  Every time one of these events happens the response of crypto purists is to declare that only decentralized finance works and that must be the path ahead. This is folly. Creating an ultra-low-risk financial system that runs only on-chain will defeat the entire purpose of capital markets: to channel capital to risk-takers who can use it to build businesses. The moment you take risk you enter in the space of human judgment and away from strict algorithms.  Read more: Paul Brody - Why Blockchains Are as Important as ERP for the Future of Companies  The second disappointment is our slow progress around the world on well-organized blockchain and cryptocurrency regulations. Enforcement actions against bad actors make sense, but in the absence of positive rules they also have a chilling effect on good actors who would like to enter the business but are afraid of finding themselves on the wrong side of rules that have yet to be set. I’m not speculating here. I know. EY serves multiple blue chip financial institutions that are waiting for clarity before they enter the stablecoin and crypto space.  So, we’re now in a less than ideal situation. Bad actors are undeterred by the lack of regulation, but good actors are. The result: Bad actors face far less competition. It’s not, thankfully, zero competition. There are quite a lot of good actors in this space, but due to absent regulatory clarity and standards even those players are having a hard time differentiating themselves from the bad guys. Every bad actor claims they’re audited, professionally run and take compliance seriously, and few end-users know enough to tell the truth from fiction.  Blue chip financial institutions are waiting for clarity before they enter the stablecoin and crypto space.  Lastly, a looming recession and an endless stream of crypto failures is trimming budgets and enthusiasm for risk-takers in the industrial space. It’s hard enough convincing risk-averse chief investment officers to bet on emerging technologies; it gets even harder as they contemplate slashing budgets in the face of a potential recession.  Read more: Jeff Wilser and Xinyi Luo - 10 Predictions for the Future of Crypto in 2023  If there is a silver lining to the probability that we will learn no useful lessons from this difficult time, it is that progress for public blockchains, for Ethereum and for privacy technology is inevitable. Nothing that has happened this year has made private and permissioned blockchains any more useful or interesting. Along the way, lots of good things are happening as well. I want to pick out three from 2022:  First, the Merge. The people of Ethereum put to rest any more ideas that they can’t run globally important infrastructure. The orderly shift from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake blew away, with one stroke, two of the biggest complaints enterprises had about Ethereum: that there is no clear accountability to responsibly manage the system and that it generates too large a carbon footprint. The battle for layer one is over and Ethereum won.  Second, non-fungible tokens. The market for speculative generative art has largely deflated, but the market for enduring and transferable personal digital trophies, proof of attendance and collectibles is just getting started. NFTs will soon be everywhere for everything from concert tickets to race medals. It’s not about making money. It’s about collecting the story of your life and accomplishments and sharing them with the world. NFTs have immense industrial applications as well. Most things companies make are unique, even if that’s just the batch number or serial number. That’s still an NFT, not a fungible token.  Finally, DAOs. Decentralized autonomous organizations are a ray of sunshine in the blockchain ecosystem. They are emerging as a vehicle for people to build and organize just about everything, from new companies to shared investment vehicles to non-profit charities. This year they started to accelerate, with a wide range of tools and services making it easy for just about anyone to set up and start managing a DAO.  2022 is over, and that’s a relief. The building goes on and the bad actors of this year will soon just be quiz show trivia questions.

Web3 infrastructure advancements are widely seen as key to bringing more people and brands into the crypto industry.  The funding was revealed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the details, including Arca's participation, were confirmed by Sortium CEO Marc Seal in an interview with CoinDesk.Seal didn’t specify who the other investors were, but said the group included other crypto-native firms.  Startups are raising capital despite an extended crypto bear market following a string of high-profile collapses, including that of multibillion-dollar crypto exchange FTX. Sortium’s SEC filing showed a $14 million target for the seed round, but the company said it decided not to pursue the full amount.  “We started raising [money] at that $14 million, and we had originally gotten offers that would have completed the round very shortly after we announced,” explained Seal. “We decided not to go that route and focus more on strategic partners and see what the landscape was turning into.”  AI meets blockchain  Sortium's roughly 50 employees include blockchain engineers, artificial intelligence engineers and a full game studio that can launch its own titles or help partners develop games.  “Sortium allows you to generate, tokenize and simulate,” said Seal. “You can generate 3D assets, regenerate consent with artificial intelligence and it will get automatically tokenized. That’s our Web3 blockchain layer.”  Sortium is focused on showcasing its technological framework to help potential partners and clients understand what generative artificial intelligence systems, blockchains and dynamic private economic systems can accomplish. The startup is also preparing to launch its first play-to-earn game. CosmoGene will let players create unique virtual genetic experiments generated from AI-backed synthetic DNA. The game learns and adapts to the player, which in turn grows the environment.  With respect to funding, Sortium is still considering accepting up to another $2 million from investors interested in the seed round. The company is also strategizing how and when to pursue a Series A fundraise.

Another round of job cuts brings up the profitability question. Short interest hits a new high at the end of 2022. Despite being up almost 39% from its recent all-time public trading low, shares of cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase ( COIN ) have still lost more than 80% of their value over the past year. As many digital currencies saw huge plunges in their trading prices, the company saw its revenues fall, profits swing to losses, and cash flow turns to cash burn. A couple of weeks into the new year, shares have recently spiked, but there are lots of reasons why the bears remain here. This week, Coinbase announced a second round of job cuts , with roughly a quarter of its workforce being dumped. While management reaffirmed some of its previous guidance for 2022, it has become clear that the expense base here was just too high. Adjusted EBITDA for last year is still supposed to be around negative $500 million, but hopes are that this number could improve a bit this year as the crypto space rebounds and expenses are trimmed in a meaningful way. In a note out a few days ago, an analyst at Bank of America ( BAC ) detailed how Coinbase trading volumes are estimated to be rather low currently . Citing CoinGecko data, the analyst said that the trading platform's volumes for December, the first full month after rival FTX (FTT-USD) imploded, were less than half of its Q1-Q3 monthly average of around $76 billion. As I mentioned in a previous article, the FTX contagion was likely to spread , and there have been a lot of worries over multiple players in the space going bankrupt in recent months. In the chart below, you can see average daily Bitcoin (BTC-USD) trading volumes per quarter over the past two years. Bitcoin Quarterly Trading Volume (Yahoo! Finance) For the first 10 days of January, Bitcoin trading volume is down almost 50% as compared to the first 10 days of October. Some might suggest this is due to seasonality and the holidays, but the fall is well over 60% if I compare trading volumes to the first 10 days of 2022. One might think that the fall in Bitcoin would lead to more overall trading, as we sometimes see with lower-priced stocks, but that certainly isn't the case here. Other than companies that are legitimately on the verge of bankruptcy, there aren't too many names seeing analyst estimates come down this much right now. In the table below, you can see how the Street has significantly reduced its revenue estimates, even just in the past month. For this five-quarter period, the combined topline number has nearly been sliced in half since that late June date, with the percentage drop being even higher for many of the 2023 periods. Coinbase Revenue Estimates (Seeking Alpha) If you look at the annual estimates on certain sites, you might find some slightly different numbers due to a different amount of analysts providing full year vs. quarterly figures. If you total up the four 2023 quarters above, the total revenue number has come down by $600 million in the past month. Even with the significant job cuts, we are likely to see more losses coming, when you consider in Q3 that total operating expenses for the company were nearly $1.15 billion in that one quarter alone, and that didn't include interest or other expenses further down the income statement. In my previous article on the name, I mentioned how short interest in Coinbase had hit a new all-time high . We received the end of December update on short interest on Wednesday, and it turns out that the previous record has again been eclipsed. Another 4.34 million shares were shorted in the final month of 2022, ending the year's dramatic surge seen below. Coinbase Short Interest (NASDAQ) Unlike my previous update, however, the dollar value of shares short did actually decline. That's only because shares lost almost a quarter of their value in December. With roughly 26% of its reported float short , Coinbase remains one of the most shorted large-cap names in the market today. I wouldn't consider the name a major short squeeze candidate at the moment, though, just because the days to cover ratio is a little less than 3. That means it would only take about 3 days' worth of average trading volume for all shorts to exit, whereas I look for major short squeeze names where that ratio is in the high single digits or sometimes even double digits. Coinbase shares closed at $43.79 on Wednesday. While in percentage terms there has been a significant bounce from the recent $31.55 low, the stock remains at a small fraction of its public trading peak that came near $369. I keep mentioning about the decline in the street's average price target , and that figure is down another $11 since my previous article. At a $60 average, there's still a significant upside according to analysts, but they also saw this name as worth more than $375 just a year ago as a point of reference. Thursday's CPI report could have a huge impact on Coinbase shares, as a big market move in either direction could lead to a nice rally or a big fall. A volatile name like this would certainly benefit if the Fed changes course and really slows its tightening monetary policy stance this year, which likely would benefit the crypto space. One thing that I'll be watching closely is if the stock does decline, because it closed Wednesday just below its 50-day moving average (purple line) seen in the chart below. If Coinbase stays under this important technical line, which is currently trending lower, we could see more pressure on shares in the near term. A decent rally, however, could get the 50-day to level off and perhaps move higher, which might cement this breakout for at least a few weeks. Coinbase Last 6 Months (Yahoo! Finance) In the end, the bears continue to be out in full force regarding Coinbase. The company announced another large round of job cuts this week, only increasing recent concerns about profitability and cash flow. Crypto trading volumes aren't doing great, especially since the FTX blowup, and analysts continue to cut their revenue estimates and price targets. While shares of this name could do quite well if the Fed has to back off on its tightening plans for this year, the recent sharp rally could evaporate very quickly if the status quo remains and confidence in the overall crypto space continues to dwindle.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4569845-coinbase-bears-out-full-force?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7512609.jpeg

42393878,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brb1YL,1673642513,Crypto Markets Analysis: A Fresh Look at Bitcoin Price Charts After Biggest Rally in 9 Months,"This week's sudden burst in the crypto markets means it's time to reassess key levels on bitcoin’s price charts.  Bitcoin (BTC) rose 12.5% over the most recent seven days, its best weekly performance since March, and ether (ETH) rose 12.15%, a welcome change from what had been persistently flat trading for most of the prior month.  Momentum grew in both assets all week; neither had a negative trading day. BTC in particular built to a crescendo on Thursday as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose 5% following the release of the U.S. consumer price index for December,showing inflation slowed during the month.  On a relative basis, bitcoin’s seven-day performance was eighth among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. ETH was not far behind, finishing 12th in the group for the second consecutive week.  Solana (SOL) completed a second consecutive week of strong performance, registering a 26% increase, on the heels of a 35% advance in the prior week. Avalanche (AVAX) led the way among the group, increasing 34%.  The laggards on the week were TONCOIN and LEO, falling -0.71% and 1.29%, respectively.     Bitcoin enters new area of support  From a chart watchers’ perspective, there are two opposing points:  Bitcoin’s rise to $19,000 moves it to a key area of potential new support.  Bitcoin’s rise to $19,000 also moves it to historically overbought levels.  Point one can be seen using the Visible Range Volume Profile tool, which shows BTC moving from one high-volume node area near $16,700 to another high-volume node area near $19,200.  The significance is that areas of high volume imply areas of high price agreement. These areas often serve as levels of support and/or resistance, and help explain why BTC prices were mired between $16,000 and $17,000 for so long.  Point two is illustrated via BTC’s current Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading of 84. The RSI is a momentum indicator ranging from 0 to 100. Readings of 30 and below imply that an asset is overpriced. By contrast, readings of 70 and above imply that an asset may be overpriced.  BTC’s current reading is its highest reading since January 2021. Since 2018, BTC’s RSI has been higher than 84 just 25 times.  This isn’t to say that an asset can’t stay overbought for extended periods. The 91 RSI level reached on Jan 8., 2021 was followed by a 15% increase in price 30 days later. It should be monitored.

42414694,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBDPvx,1673641033,Left for Dead Crypto Names Roar Higher as Bitcoin Bounces,"With nearly the entire universe of publicly traded crypto stocks down 70% to 90% or even more in 2022, just a little bit of life in bitcoin (BTC) this week has led to outsized sector gains.  Trading at $19,370 at press time, bitcoin is up about 13% this week, at its strongest level in the more than two months since the implosion of crypto exchange FTX.  Among the big movers this week is Coinbase (COIN), up 49%. The crypto exchange has seen a number of sell-side downgrades and price target cuts to begin the year and also faced a credit rating downgrade from Moody's. The company also this week announced a cut of 20% of its workforce. Cathie Wood's ARK Investment, however, has been doing some bottom-fishing, purchasing $7.5 million in Coinbase stock this week and about $28.5 million over the past month.  Thanks to a combination of a low bitcoin price, rising electricity costs, often high debt levels and nearly closed capital markets, bitcoin miners came into 2023 facing an existential crisis. Indeed, Core Scientific (CORZ), one of the largest miners by computing power, already declared bankruptcy and Argo Blockchain (ARBK) barely fended Chapter 11 off after a late-inning bailout from Michael Novogratz's Galaxy Digital (GLXY.TO).  Things were so bad that one of the leading miners – Riot Blockchain – began the year exorcising all ties to crypto from its name, re-branding itself as Riot Platforms (RIOT).  Given those factors, just the modestly good news for bitcoin sent the sector's shares exploding higher. Marathon Digital (MARA) has gained 79% this week, Hut 8 Mining (HUT) added 49% and Bit Digital rose 41%. As for Riot, it's ahead just 27% this week, perhaps punishment for giving up ""blockchain"" in its name.  Other crypto stocks on the move include MicroStrategy (MSTR), advancing 30% this week, and troubled crypto bank Silvergate Capital (SI) rising 11%.

42411279,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMage,1673640532,Worldwide Grassroots Projects Can Lead Crypto Recovery,"During the House Financial Services Committee’s FTX hearings last month, Rep. Jesus Garcia (D-Ill.) described crypto as “an entire industry” that “thinks it's above the law,” and then said something that irked me even more than that unhelpful opening generalization.  Crypto companies “are making money using one thing: hype,” Garcia said. “And when the hype runs out, these businesses fail and ordinary investors, especially latecomers who are disproportionately low income, Black and Latino, lose.”  Now, it’s true that many people of color bought crypto in recent years and that, by extension, many have lost money on account of Celsius Network, FTX, Voyager Digital, et al. But there’s a subtext to Garcia’s comment – whether or not he consciously intended it – that patronizingly paints certain communities in the U.S. and elsewhere as ill-informed and vulnerable, denying them agency and blindly missing a bigger story of empowerment.  Take a look at hundreds of grassroots crypto projects led by Blacks and Latinos in the U.S., and at the many crypto-based business models arising in Africa, Asia and Latin America, and you will find large swaths of human beings from income-challenged, marginalized or oppressed communities seeking new ways to take charge of their lives.  There’s a reason why the top four positions in Chainalysis’ activity and purchasing power-weighted country ranking of per-capita crypto adoption are occupied by Vietnam, the Philippines, Ukraine and India and why the sixth-through-10th positions belong to, Pakistan, Brazil, Thailand, Russia and China. And according to a forthcoming report on “Black Experiences in Web3” from the Crypto Research and Design Lab (CRADL), there’s also a reason why the fifth position is occupied by the U.S., the only developed Western country in the list: It’s because of an outsized level of adoption among Black Americans.  Hint for Garcia: The common denominator across this top ten is not Sam Bankman-Fried. FTX’s Super Bowl ads featuring Larry David weren’t subliminally targeting rickshaw drivers in Vietnam, refugees in Ukraine or, for that matter, Black hospitality workers in the U.S. Millions of people worldwide got into this field because they saw a way around a legacy financial system that had kept them from executing on their own untapped potential.  Sure, these marginalized early adopters are still a minority in their communities. Cryptocurrencies are far from universally accepted. And the negative sentiment generated by the 2022 meltdown will slow growth. But the worldwide adoption trend among these groups is on the up and it’s poised over the long term to disrupt the Western financial establishment, which whether it likes to be labeled as such or not, includes privileged “crypto bros” who treated centralized token exchanges as casinos to 10-x their dollar wealth.  These people, once marginalized, are now poised to lead the industry’s recovery from its doldrums.  Change from without, not within  I believe the solutions these outsiders build will end up as the true source of this technology’s promised revolution in the Web3 era. It won’t be like the prior Web2 internet “revolution,” when Wall Street-listed, U.S.-owned Google, Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook disrupted the infrastructure of mainstream commerce by enticing Westerners operating inside those legacy systems to shift to new platform-based business models. The paradigm change is going to emanate from outside the system – from the developing world and from marginalized communities within the developed world.  After the implosion of the “CeFi” trading and lending bubble, it’s the ones bringing local, real-world focused use cases to their communities who now have the opportunity to redefine crypto’s purpose, to separate it from the empty hype of speculation that FTX came to define.  The unpublished CRADL report on Black crypto adoption notes a startling statistic from a Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City survey: Eighteen percent of Black consumers in the U.S. hold cryptocurrencies while only 7% own stocks and 2% mutual funds. By comparison, 12% of white consumers own crypto, while 19% of them own stocks and 12% mutual funds.  The report explores the root cause of this contrast, describing a deep-seated mistrust of the stock market and of the white financial establishment among Black Americans, which stems from the phenomenon of “generational financial trauma” (GFT) and which has in turn fed an appreciation of the crypto narrative of self-empowerment.  A concept that researchers have identified since their studies of Holocaust survivors in the 1960s, GFT is the idea that historical racial injustices are passed on for generations and shape how its victims interact with financial systems.  Slavery is the example par excellence, a source of lasting trauma that, via structural racism and deep-seated mistrust, has imposed burdens on Black Americans for centuries.  If you’re inclined to dismiss such ideas and want descendents of slaves to let bygones be bygones, I urge you to listen to the “Money Reimagined” episode we released on May 21, 2021. It featured Jerry Tardieu, a Haitian author, entrepreneur and politician, and Daniele Jean-Pierre, co-founder and chief operating officer of Zimbali Networks, which is developing digital currency payment products on the island.  There, we talked about the massive loan that France imposed on the Haitian government formed by the ex-slaves who had ousted their former masters in 1804. It was framed as compensation for French slave owners' loss of “property.” The unpayable debt ultimately ended up in the hands of National City Bank of New York, which would later become Citibank. The debt was finally retired in 1947, but not before it had imposed a century-long burden of economic dependency on the impoverished Caribbean nation. It’s understandable that Haitians would hold an abiding mistrust of Wall Street and might be open to Zimbali’s offerings.  From Philippines to Nigeria  For other examples of crypto projects developed by and for local communities, look at the projects showcased in the Web3athon that CRADL explored in partnership with CoinDesk. Winners and standouts included Evolve, which has built a Polygon-based incentivized financial literacy program for women among Black, Indigenous and people of color; IndiGG, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for indigenous communities; and the Carbon Coffee Collective, a regenerative financing project providing financing to coffee farms to switch to generative agriculture.  Or consider the phenomenon of Web3 gaming guilds, such as Yield Guild Games from the Philippines or IndiGG DAO, an Indian version. Philippines-based Emfarsis director Leah Callon-Butler, a CoinDesk opinion contributor, describes these communities of play-to-earn gamers as “a great example of a Web3 innovation that is super grassroots and community oriented.” She says there are already 17,500 such Web3 guilds around the world.  Callon-Butler also cites Impact Market, a protocol designed for communities to develop financial inclusion and social-impact projects, as a tool that’s driving other grassroots empowerment projects in developing countries.  These tools and ideas are stirring innovation that’s tailored to local needs everywhere.  In another “Money Reimagined” episode from 2021 my co-host Sheila Warren and I learned from Yele Bademosi, the former CEO of payments app Bundle Africa, and Adia Sowho, a venture builder and operator, about the explosion of decentralized finance (DeFi) innovation underway in Nigeria. There, local developers who are fed up with rampant inflation and a corrupt, oppressive government are building workarounds to the official financial system.  And in yet another episode that included South African digital artist Lethabo Huma, we highlighted the opportunities that non-fungible token (NFTs) posed to Black and other historically underrepresented artists to sell directly to collectors, avoiding the exclusionary practices of art snobs in the white-controlled gallery world.  What’s striking about a lot of these projects is that they’re founded on something more than technological or financial innovation; it’s a form of social innovation, of figuring out how communities can use new governance models and tokenomics to band together in both the common and the individual interest.  The more they proliferate, the more they will start to stand as a challenge to the centralized, hierarchical systems of the West, beholden as they are to the financial system led by Wall Street.  It won’t happen overnight, but it reflects a slow, quiet revolution. Over time, its impact will make the FTX meltdown seem like a blip.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Michael J.

7510789,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516022,1673640026,Monero Has Been On A Bullish Run But Will The Momentum Hold?,"The Monero price has rallied over the past week since the broader market recovered. Over the last 24 hours, XMR was consolidating despite its weekly gains. The coin traded laterally over the past few sessions before it started to dip on its chart. As momentum halted recently, it is still uncertain whether XMR will resume its upward price movement. The technical outlook of the coin continued to side with the bulls despite lateral trading. Accumulation remains high on the chart despite a downtick in demand over the last trading sessions. Monero also displayed overbuying tendencies, and the recent fall in the asset’s value could be tied to a price correction. Related Reading: Chainlink Bullish Divergence: What To Expect In 2023 The altcoin can prevent considerable loss if Monero stays above its immediate support line. The market capitalization of Monero declined slightly, meaning that the coin encountered selling in the past trading sessions. At the current price, the coin was trading at 70% low than its all-time high secured in 2021. Monero Price Analysis: One-Day Chart XMR was trading at $166 at press time. Over the last week, the coin secured gains and pierced through various resistance lines. The coin crossed the $157 resistance line and flipped it into a support zone for itself. Monero was trading on an ascending trendline (white), typically characterized by a breakout, either on the upside or the downside. Over the last 24 hours, XMR diverted from the trendline and fell on its chart. This could imply that the coin will depreciate and rest at $163, then drop to $157 before rising again. For Monero, there was stiff resistance at $169, which is why the coin could not move past it. The resistance above the line has not been breached since July last year. The amount of Monero traded in the previous session was red, indicating that the coin experienced some selling. Technical Analysis Although XMR noted a slight downtick in demand, sellers were minimal compared to buyers. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was still above the 70 mark. This indicated that the asset was overbought, which means that a price correction for Monero was on its way. Depicting bullishness, XMR was above the 20-Simple Moving Average line (SMA), indicating that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. XMR also rested above the 50-SMA (yellow) and 200-SMA (green) lines. Per the increase in accumulation, the technical outlook depicts buy signals. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) reads the price momentum and trend reversals. MACD formed green signal bars, but the last bar declined in height. This ideally means that the price is expected to fall.

42411276,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMadL,1673639231,Is Sam Bankman-Fried Losing His Mind?,"The American Psychiatric Association in 1973 instituted what’s known as “The Goldwater Rule.” This then-novel principle of medical ethics held that psychiatrists should not make diagnoses of public figures at a distance, for instance based on public statements.  Luckily, I’m not a psychiatrist or a medical practitioner of any kind. So I’m free to say that, based on his most recent public statements, Sam Bankman-Fried seems to be losing his mind.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  I make this claim not as a professional psychologist but as a professional reader and writer and financial de-mystifier. Bankman-Fried’s latest effort at public self-exoneration, the first blog post for his newly created Substack, will strike the informed reader as the fizzling, semi-coherent ejection of a mind trapped in a closed and degrading orbit around itself.  Despite what financier Bill Ackman seems to think for some cockeyed reason, Bankman-Fried’s lie-packed and subtly unhinged disquisition is not worth your time to read, except as a set of symptoms manifesting from a psyche teetering along the event horizon of a black hole.  So I read it for you.  Bankman-Fried’s “FTX Pre-Mortem Overview” repeats the same ham-fisted evasions and outright lies that marked his pre-arrest public apology tour. The repetition yet again of these claims and evasions, so manifestly divorced from clear public knowledge, is a strong enough sign of some manic decoupling. But the writing itself, with its wandering need and scattered malapropisms, also hints at something beneath the surface.  See also: Sam Bankman-Fried Blogs Like a Crypto Robin Hood, but inn Court He’s Less Charitable  Above all, Bankman-Fried’s version of events, seemingly unchanged since before his arrest, is premised on one key omission. This glaring blind spot is obvious to those living in reality but seems completely invisible to him: the corrupt nature of the relationship between Alameda Research and FTX.  The new post maintains Bankman-Fried’s unwavering focus on the meltdown of Alameda Research, the supposedly unrelated hedge fund that he founded before FTX, as the determining factor in the entire affair. Bankman-Fried describes in great detail the decline in Alameda’s balance sheet amid the crypto market crash of 2022, and claims that Alameda’s failure “to sufficiently hedge against the risk of an extreme market crash” was fundamental to his downfall.  This leaves out at least three simple and crucial facts that enabled the FTX fraud.  First, Bankman-Fried still acts as if Alameda was an entirely separate operation guided by decisions that remain some sort of vague mystery to him. But the apparent reality, already reported to law enforcement by former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, is that Bankman-Fried continued to have direct and overriding control of Alameda’s operations after formally stepping down as CEO in 2019.  Second, Bankman-Fried omits that Alameda had a “secret exemption” from margin collateral and liquidation requirements on FTX. This was a likely criminally fraudulent insider arrangement, and effectively gave Alameda’s operators free rein to dip into FTX spot market user funds – funds that FTX explicitly promised users never to lend out in any form – to continue their losing trades.  Finally, Bankman-Fried omits that FTX never took proper custody of customers’ fiat deposits, instead leaving $8 billion of free, unaccounted money in the infamous “hidden, poorly internally labeled fiat account” controlled by Alameda. Bankman-Fried had previously acknowledged this move, which he characterized as an $8 billion “accident.”  Head like a hole  The same lies of omission have been repeated by Bankman-Fried so often now that they’re almost boring. They certainly shouldn’t be convincing to anyone paying the slightest bit of attention. That’s why Bankman-Fried’s apparent belief that they should be persuasive invites speculation about his state of mind – it’s hard to imagine a fully sane and rational person in Bankman-Fried’s position continuing to insist on this sort of alternative reality.  I’ve written several times before about my diagnosis of the specific variety of Bankman-Fried’s break from reality: elite delusion. Sam Bankman-Fried was born and bred in a cosseted environment that assured him he could do no wrong. (His mother, Barbara Fried, seems to literally doubt that any such thing as “wrong” exists.)  Bankman-Fried likely rationalized his crimes along the way as a mix of improvisational growth-hacking and temporary shortcuts to a long-term good – one of the implicit pillars of the effective altruism he espoused, however cynically. He is now being confronted with the reality of his actions. Instead of acknowledging and processing that reality, he is escaping into a fantasy world in which all the nice things his mommy and daddy and professors and investors told him about himself are still true.  The latest post also hints, though, that not even the few people still close to him remain committed to Bankman-Fried’s counterfactual belief in his own faultless goodness. The post is so poorly organized, argued and written that it doesn’t even seem to have been proofread. Certainly not by his lawyers – like his frenzied media tour ahead of his arrest, the blog post was almost certainly published without or against the advice of whoever is still willing to represent him.  See also: Who Are Sam Bankman-Fried's Politically Connected 'Wealthy Co-Conspirators’  It doesn’t seem likely it was reviewed by Bankman-Fried’s law-scholar parents, either – at one point the post misspells the name of Sullivan & Cromwell, a well-known law firm Bankman-Fried worked with for years (“Sullivan & Crowell”). This isn’t a direct index of Bankman-Fried’s mental state – we all make mistakes. But that a man who faces spending literally the rest of his life in prison would dribble out such a half-baked attempt at self-exoneration, without anyone close to him being willing or able to mitigate its rangy sloppiness, implies an extreme isolation that can only divorce him further from reality.  Lie-ghtning round  Finally, here are a few highlights of other bits of the post that are simply false, or otherwise hint at an extreme break with reality.  Bankman-Fried claims that he didn’t steal any money and that “nearly all of my assets were and still are utilizable to backstop FTX customers.” Meanwhile, in reality, he has argued that he should be able to retain his personal $450 million stake in Robinhood Markets to pay for his legal expenses. That’s despite the fact that the stake was acquired through a seemingly fraudulent conveyance: a personal loan from FTX to a Bankman-Fried-co-owned holding company.  Bankman-Fried claims that “FTX International and Alameda were both legitimately and independently profitable businesses in 2021, each making billions.” Here again we seem to be in Sam’s personal mind-palace for special accounting. In the real world, we know that Alameda and FTX claimed losses of $3.7 billion over the course of the pre-2022 bull market, the rare case of an under-performance so bad it smacks of fraud.  Bankman-Fried cites “billions of dollars in funding offers” from interested FTX buyers that “could have made all customers whole” if only his pesky lawyers hadn’t forced him to declare bankruptcy for FTX. This is simply laughable: Bankman-Fried seems to genuinely believe that he could have enticed someone to spend $10 billion paying back the money he stole. Meanwhile, the only publicly acknowledged buyout offer, from Binance, was withdrawn as quickly as a hand burned by a hot stove as soon as the buyer got a look at the books (which were probably more like a wad of napkins).  Bankman-Fried repeatedly refers to “illiquid assets” on the FTX balance sheet. Given what we know about how Bankman-Fried thinks about finance, this likely includes fraudulently marketed “assets” such as FTX’s own FTT token and Serum’s SRM token. These are not “illiquid” – they’re worthless.  Bankman-Fried cites Alameda’s declining share of FTX’s pre-collapse trading volume and liquidity as evidence of a potential FTX comeback. This is pure howling madness, like saying you can rebuild your car company because only 5% of the cars you made exploded on ignition and killed everyone inside.  Bankman-Fried descends even further into conspiracy theories about other people’s responsibility for his own actions. Again he targets his bankruptcy counsel, hinting that Sullivan & Cromwell pressured him into the bankruptcy filing for their own (unclear) benefit. This again directs attention away from the simple fact that he stole billions of dollars.

Brandt is now claiming that Bitcoin is putting in a “low for this cycle now,” according to a new TradingView post. This call for a bear market bottom is already being met with skepticism, but given the chilling accuracy at which Brandt had made related to his cryptocurrency bets in the past, there could be more validity than investors are ready to accept. Peter L. Brandt TradingView Post Calls For Cycle Low In BTC In a new TradingView post currently trending on the charting platform’s editor’s picks section, career commodities trader Peter L. Brandt says that the cycle lows for the crypto market are taking place “now.” Although Brandt doesn’t directly state that the bottom is already in, he does believe that Bitcoin’s behavior is “predictable” and should see a strong advance after the recent, nearly 80% decline. Related Reading: “Parabolic” Signal That Triggered Past Bitcoin Bull Runs Reappears Brandt famously called for an 80% decline in BTCUSD in late January 2018 after the 2017 parabolic advance was violated.

The Factor LLCCEO is a classical chartist, and in his TradingView post shares a 6-month timeframe bar chart.

42414680,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBDOJ8,1673636262,Grayscale Slams SEC's 'Unreasonable' Barring of Spot Bitcoin ETFs,"In a new court filing, digital asset management company Grayscale blasted the U.S. securities regulator for its ""illogical"" and ""fundamentally unreasonable"" argument against approving a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).  The document filed on Friday was in response to the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) December defense of its decision to reject Grayscale Investment’s application to convert its flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot bitcoin ETF.  On June 29, 2022, the same day the SEC rejected its application, Grayscale filed a lawsuit requesting the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit review the order. Although a number of industry players rallied around Grayscale, the SEC stood by its rejection of the conversion, which would have allowed investors to hold bitcoin directly.  While the SEC has approved multiple applications to set up futures-based bitcoin ETFs, which are trade agreements to be executed at a future date and price, the regulator has said spot bitcoin ETFs are vulnerable to “fraudulent and manipulative conduct.""  Grayscale countered that argument Friday. It said that ""a successful manipulation of prices in the spot bitcoin market would necessarily affect the price of bitcoin futures as well – and, therefore, the value of bitcoin futures ETPs’ holdings."" Grayscale called the SEC's reasoning ""illogical.""  Grayscale also accused the SEC of exceeding its statutory authority, saying the agency ""is not permitted to decide for investors whether certain investments have merit.""  Final briefs on the case are due Feb. 3, after which three judges will be selected and the court will share a schedule for the lawsuit’s oral arguments, Grayscale Chief Legal Officer Craig Salm said in a separate blog post. He added that a final decision on the case could come by the fall.  Grayscale's parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its founder and CEO, Barry Silbert, have come under increasing pressure to do something about GBTC's large discount to net asset value.  DCG is also the parent company of CoinDesk.

7508721,https://newsbtc.com/?p=515992,1673636245,Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Spot And Derivative Reserves Shoot Up,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin spot and derivative exchange reserves have both shot up recently, a sign that could be bearish for the price. Bitcoin Spot And Derivative Reserves Register Growth As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the open interest and the funding rates are also heating up in the BTC market. The “exchange reserve” is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin that investors are depositing into wallets of centralized exchanges right now. This metric has two versions; one is for the spot exchanges, while the other is for the derivative platforms. Usually, investors deposit to spot exchanges for selling purposes, so an increase in the reserves of these platforms can suggest selling pressure is rising in the market. And as holders use derivative exchanges for opening positions on the futures market, a rise in this reserve can lead to higher volatility (the effect on the price can be in either direction). Related Reading: Bitcoin Short Squeeze: $93 Million Shorts Liquidated In One Hour Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in these Bitcoin exchange reserves over the last month: The values of all the metrics seem to have seen a rise in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, both the spot and derivative exchange reserves have increased in value recently, suggesting that investors have been making deposits to these platforms. The increased spot reserves suggest an elevated selling pressure in the market, while the derivative reserves imply an overheated futures sector. The chart also includes data for two other metrics, the open interest, and the funding rates. The “open interest” is an indicator that measures the total amount of futures positions currently open on derivative exchanges. This metric takes into account both short and long contracts. The graph shows that this metric has also trended up recently, further suggesting that the futures market is currently overheated. The other indicator, the “funding rates,” tells us whether there are more shorts or longs in the market. Related Reading: Chainlink Bullish Signal: LINK Address Activity Returns To 2021 Levels The Bitcoin funding rates are favorable now, implying that the longs are overwhelming the shorts. Generally, whichever way this metric swing tells us which of these contract holders is more at risk of a liquidation squeeze. So far, there hasn’t been any long squeeze in the market, but rather a short squeeze as the price has been able to keep up the momentum. There have been some high liquidations during the past day that may have helped calm the overheated futures market for now, but since there is increased selling pressure on the spot exchanges, BTC is still at risk for a short-term pullback.

42414687,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBDPKo,1673634990,Former SEC Lawyer Says Agency Pushing to Be Crypto Regulator With Gemini/Genesis Suit,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission may be looking to cement itself as the leading regulator of the digital-asset industry with its case against crypto firms Gemini Trust and Genesis Capital, Howard Fischer, a former SEC attorney, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Friday.  “The SEC has been trying to stake out its ground as the regulator for crypto,” Fischer said.  On Thursday, the SEC sued crypto exchange Gemini and crypto lender Genesis Global Capital for allegedly selling unregistered securities to customers of the Gemini Earn interest-bearing product.  Gemini Earn customers loaned their crypto deposits to Genesis, which then lent them out in exchange for offering Gemini customers a high yield on their deposits. In November, however, Genesis froze withdrawals, leaving an estimated 340,000 Gemini Earn customers and $900 million in crypto up in the air.  Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group, which is also CoinDesk's parent company.  “They [the SEC] want to be the regulators,” Fischer said. “And there is a significant chance that we may see them try to expand this, if it's successful” with the lawsuit.  He added that “depending on how much money is there,” and if the “notes at issue” were unregistered securities, consumers could get their money back.  “They’re [the SEC] going to try to unwind the clock and make sure to the extent possible that customers are made whole,” Fischer said. “That is limited by the assets that are available.”  Read more: SEC Alleges Gemini, Genesis Sold Unregistered Securities",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/13/former-sec-lawyer-says-agency-pushing-to-be-crypto-regulator-with-geminigenesis-suit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/34a1974b62b42504d086a6a4d5cacd44210a0499-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414685,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBDPAC,1673634047,Hive Blockchain Deploys First Intel-Powered Bitcoin Mining Machines,"Bitcoin mining firm Hive Blockchain (HIVE) has deployed its first machines based on Intel's (INTC) Blockscale chips, the miner said on Friday.  The new chips not only have the potential to break the effective duopoly of Bitmain and MicroBT in the mining machine market, but also allow mining companies to design computers to their specifications, a major departure from those other manufacturers' models.  Hive's first 5,800 machines, delivered in late 2022 and dubbed BuzzMiners, can together produce computing power between 638 petahash/second (PH/s) and 754 PH/s, or 110 terahash/second (TH/s) to 130 TH/s per machine, said Aydin Kilic, the company's president and chief operating officer. That lags behind some of Bitmain's latest models such as the Antminer S19 XP or the S19 Pro+ Hydro.  However, Hive hasn't released power efficiency data for the machines, a key metric in an environment that has brought miners to their knees over power costs. Intel touted an efficiency of 26 joules/terahash (J/T) for the chips in April, which wouldn't beat Bitmain's S19 XP series, but is on par with or better than other models currently on the market.  More than 1,500 of the Intel-powered machines have already been installed across the miner's facilities in Canada and Sweden and they have met performance targets, the miner said. Hive had initially ordered 13,000 machines to be manufactured in 2022 but reduced the order ""to methodically scale the business during the crypto bear market,"" according to the Friday press release.  Jack Dorsey's Block (SQ), troubled Argo Blockchain (ARBK) and Griid Infrastructure are set to be among the first customers for Intel's Blocksale integrated circuits.

Since last year, several crypto assets have been struggling to stay afloat as the prices of tokens fluctuate. Unfortunately, the overall outcome has not impressed many crypto participants and investors. But the new year is bringing a positive turn in the crypto market. Some crypto tokens have started reclaiming their value over the past seven days. For example, XRP has taken a more vital route as it joins the train of bullish tokens for an upward move. Related Reading: Altcoin Volume Dominance At Highest Since Jan 2021, Trouble For Bitcoin? XRP Price Trends Upward In a new development, the price of XRP surged impressively within a few days. As per data from Coincodex, XRP rose by approximately 10% in the past seven days. Further, Santiment, an on-chain data provider, reported that cryptocurrency’s recent reclaim in value is due to increasing active addresses. According to the data provider, XRP recorded about 41K active addresses on January 8, 2023. But the number surged rapidly within the next few days. As a result, the active addresses have grown to over 148K since January 12, 2023. This shows an addition of over 107K active addresses, representing over a 200% increase in less than seven days. Whales Show Increasing Activities Additionally, XR´whales have been engaging massively in transactions, as per WhaleAlert, a crypto data provider. It noted that within the past 24 hours, whales had moved about 193 million XRP worth almost $70 million cumulatively. One of the most significant single transactions is a whale’s purchase of 41 million tokens from the Bitso crypto exchange. The tokens are worth more than $15.2 million in the current market price. Also, WhaleAlert reported a transfer of 28 million XRP worth $10.55 million from an unknown whale wallet. In addition, another transfer of 40 million XRP worth $15.07 million from an anonymous wallet. These transactions moved the funds to Bitso and Bitstampc crypto exchanges, respectively. The report disclosed that whales transferred up to 88 million tokens to several crypto exchanges in the past 24 hours. 29.1 million XRP tokens went to the Bitstamp crypto exchange within the past day. On the other hand, the whales purchased 45.2 million XRP tokens from Bitso over the past 24 hours. The value of the total coins is almost $30.7 million based on the current market prices.

42411277,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMajx,1673629628,Crypto Bankruptcies Are Very Complicated,"CoinDesk’s fees for Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) went up tenfold over the past few months. You can probably guess why. A lot of the major crypto bankruptcy cases we’re following are now in full swing. FTX, BlockFi and Voyager Digital are all deep in the process of trying to organize their resources.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Burying these firms  The narrative  The thing about Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection is that by filing for it you indicate your belief that your company can survive with a bit of assistance, that it just needs time to recover. A lot of these crypto companies are fighting for every penny just to refund their creditors.  Why it matters  FTX, Voyager, Celsius Network, BlockFi and countless others are all going through a very public bankruptcy system. It’s even giving crypto industry observers some behind the scenes insight into how these firms are operating now.  Breaking it down  There were two 4+ hour hearings this week: One on Tuesday for Voyager Digital and one on Wednesday for FTX. Both discussed different issues. The main issue at the heart of Voyager’s hearing was whether its bid to sell assets to Binance US could proceed. Ultimately, the judge overseeing the case allowed the proposal to advance, though it’s still a ways off from actual approval.  FTX’s hearing was more focused on updates. Attorneys for FTX said they’d recovered around $5 billion in assets tied to the company composed of cash, liquid cryptocurrencies and other investments. The company also found a bunch of cryptos that the attorneys don’t think they can sell easily without tanking the market.  You can catch up on our coverage of this past week at the links below:  FTX Opposition to $1B Binance Deal Is 'Hypocrisy and Chutzpah,' Voyager Says  BlockFi Management Hasn't Withdrawn Any Crypto Since October, Lawyer Tells Court  Judge Allows Binance.US Bid to Buy Voyager Assets to Advance  BlockFi Creditors Battle to Keep Their Details Secret  FTX Has Recovered 'Over $5B' in Assets, Bankruptcy Attorney Says  FTX Creditor Names Can Remain Sealed for Now, Judge Rules  FTX Loan Wiped Out $800M in BlockFi Executives’ Equity, Court Filing Reveals  On a related note, CoinDesk is one of several news organizations, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and Inner City Press, to petition the court to unseal the names of the guarantors who signed Sam Bankman-Fried’s surety bonds.  During a Jan. 3 hearing, Judge Lewis Kaplan of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Bankman-Fried’s petition to seal these names on an interim basis, allowing news organizations to motion for an unsealing.  Bankman-Fried, who is allowed to continue using the internet, now has a Substack, where he reiterated many of his existing explanations for just how the FTX-Alameda situation got so dire.  As my colleague Jack Schickler points out, though, some of what Bankman-Fried wrote in his newsletter doesn’t exactly square with what his legal team’s actually doing in court.  And Bankman-Fried does not address some of the more explosive allegations said in court, such as the alleged special treatment Alameda Research received from FTX, which could include extending a $65 billion line of credit.  Davos 2023  I’ll be at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, next week. Last time, the crypto industry showed up in force. Companies and industry representatives held their own events adjacent to the main WEF conference.  That was in May. The Terra/Luna ecosystem had collapsed but it looked like the industry was otherwise unscathed.  A month later, crypto lender Celsius announced it was suspending withdrawals. Six months later, several major lenders have suspended withdrawals or filed for bankruptcies, some crypto mining firms have likewise filed for bankruptcy and the industry is at one of its lowest points in quite a while.  It’ll be interesting to see what this means for crypto’s presence at the forum. The gung-ho king of the industry has crashed back down to Earth. The movers and shakers at the event are probably more weary of crypto than they were in May, and the industry representatives themselves may be more leery of spending on what is essentially a giant marketing stunt in Switzerland.  We’ll be reporting live from the ground. If you’re attending, feel free to drop me a line on Telegram – t.me/nikhileshde – and let’s catch up.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  N/A  Outside CoinDesk:  (Grid) Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) spoke to Grid reporter (and CoinDesk alumnus) Ben Powers about a variety of issues, including crypto: “I don’t want to proverbially throw the baby out with the bathwater, but I think the crypto theory of the case is really under assault.”  (Seattle Times) Aviation authorities in the U.S. and France have criticized a report published by Ethiopia’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau examining the crash of Ethiopian Airlines flight 301 – otherwise known as the second of two Boeing 737-MAX crashes which led to the grounding of the entire model (disclosure: I own Boeing stock). While Ethiopia’s report pins the blame for the crash squarely on Boeing and its now-infamous Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, the National Transportation Safety Board and Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses say the pilots of the flight were “contributing factors.”  (The Washington Post) So… “the Nationals [professional baseball team in Washington, D.C.] are so limited in their revenue streams that they have maintained affiliation with Terra cryptocurrency as the title sponsor for their club level despite the fact that the company’s founder is on the run from the law. The alternative, according to a person familiar with the situation, would be to give back the $38.15 million Terra paid them to own naming rights to that club for five years.” Ya know, I was wondering.

42414677,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBDOZ3,1673629200,New MetaMask Product to Add Liquid Staking via Lido and Rocket Pool,"Just in time for Ethereum’s consequential Shanghai update, which will soon allow users to withdraw ether (ETH) they’ve “staked” to help secure the network, popular wallet provider MetaMask is taking a swing at helping more users stake in the first place.  ConsenSys, the company behind MetaMask, said on Friday it is adding a staking feature to MetaMask Portfolio – its newly launched one-stop shop for users to view their crypto holdings and send (or “bridge”) them between different blockchains. MetaMask’s new staking feature will allow users to stake via Lido or Rocket Pool, the two leading community-led validator services.  Staking via Lido and Rocket Pool involves locking up one's ether in a smart contract on the blockchain, where it will accrue rewards. Currently, this usually requires visiting Lido and Rocket Pool’s respective websites.  “By allowing staking through the MetaMask Portfolio dapp, we are providing MetaMask users with a convenient way to interact with staking providers,” Abad Mian, product manager at MetaMask, said in a statement shared with CoinDesk.  Staked ether – and whatever rewards it accrues – will remain impossible for users to withdraw until Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade expected in March. Liquid staking services such as Lido and Rocket Pool get around this limitation by giving their depositors tokens representing a one-to-one claim on their staked ETH. These tokens, Lido’s stETH and RocketPool’s rETH, tend to trade on the open market at a slight discount to normal ETH, offering stakers a way to enter and exit staking positions even as withdrawals are currently locked.  With MetaMask staking, “customers can swap their stETH and rETH back to ETH via MetaMask Swaps, subject to certain fees,” ConsenSys said in a statement.  Representatives for ConsenSys declined CoinDesk’s interview request in advance of this article. When asked via email if MetaMask would expand staking to other staking services or to blockchains in addition to Ethereum, Mian said ConsenSys aimed to make staking via MetaMask the “easiest and most convenient way to stake across Web3.”  Read more: Crypto Traders Are Already Placing Bets on Ethereum’s 'Shanghai Hard Fork'",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | RPL | FORKS,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/13/new-metamask-product-to-add-liquid-staking-via-lido-and-rocket-pool,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a7d83b776819418c2d569a5398bfd2acb20c482f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411273,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMaQ7,1673628432,Bitcoin Mining Companies Need to Better Manage Risk,"This past year has created an unprecedented risk event for the Bitcoin community. While we’ve seen this level of spot price volatility before, the leverage within the mining community has reached record levels. This has compounded the effects of debt exposure with falling spot prices, increasing energy price and diminishing collateral value. Bad treasury management ran rampant in 2022 and led to a problem that financial hedges can solve and/or prevent.  The strategy many miners have used to manage treasuries up until this point has been relatively simple: buy and hold bitcoin. In other words, hope and pray. With price models often assuming an average of ~2% spot growth per month, and a price floor near the current average production cost between $18,000 and $22,000. Clearly those assumptions have not held true.  Nathan Cox is the chief investment officer at Two Prime, which offers structured products and derivative strategies for digital assets and risk management.  Machine financing in 2021 was deployed at record prices, when large orders came with long delays and profit margins were wide. As those orders were filled, and hash power continues to grow, hashprice has tested new all-time lows in 2022 and has already begun to test the durability of this long-leverage strategy. A close look at public miners’ U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings shows that many companies are in dire straights.  See also: Crypto Terms Become Dirty Words as Bear Market Lingers  Now miners have to face a difficult reality, can operational budgets survive a prolonged crypto winter?  The answer will not be the same across the board, and we have already seen several casualties of the new bear regime. Our concern is that bitcoin miners have over-exposed themselves, and now face potential liquidation if bitcoin prices remain depressed for an extended period of time.  So how do miners navigate this financial and operational minefield?  Miners must incorporate sophisticated financial strategies, in line with energy and commodity companies who have come before them. If bitcoin is indeed a commodity, then it's time industry leaders start treating it like one by managing financial exposure with financial strategies.  For years, the oil and gas industry has used sophisticated risk management strategies and gold miners have used target redemption forwards (TARF), a structured financial contract that allows for the hedging of risk.  Miners too should be looking to reduce downside risk, replace upside beta and generate yield on their digital assets. These strategies are time-tested in traditional commodity markets, and have allowed major energy companies to consistently expand their operations for decades. Miners are recognizing this need, though it may be too late for some.  See also: Europe’s Last Bitcoin Mining Refuge Is No Longer Viable  With the current macroeconomic backdrop, rising interest rates, reduced liquidity and waning risk assets, it is time that the digital asset industry takes the necessary steps to weather this volatility and incorporate financial tools that will create sustainability and certainty. It is the appropriate behavior of any fiduciary running a bitcoin mining firm.  The digital asset industry has suffered major setbacks from leveraged borrowing without capital controls or risk management, and it is time we reconsider the long-term growth strategy for the industry. The solutions exist today to prevent further losses or liquidations, and it is our hope that miners have the constitution to evolve for a brighter future.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Nathan Cox ,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/13/bitcoin-mining-companies-need-to-better-manage-risk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2a97a39bddc3e3edfdbba7835113586cd0c49b1a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42414675,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBDOOR,1673628197,BitConnect’s Victims to Receive $17M in Restitution Seized From Scam’s Promoter,"A California judge has ordered $17 million in restitution to be paid out to hundreds of victims of the BitConnect Ponzi scheme, the infamous global scam that collapsed in 2018.  U.S. District Court Judge Todd Robinson in San Diego, California, issued the order on Thursday. The money will come from the $56 million forfeited by one of BitConnect’s top promoters, Glenn Arcaro.  Arcaro pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in September 2021. One year later, in September 2022, Arcaro was convicted and sentenced to 38 months in prison for his role in the scheme. Arcaro held a position near the top of BitConnect’s pyramid scheme of promoters, and earned 15% of every investment in BitConnect’s “Lending Program” – which defrauded thousands of investors around the world of an estimated $2.4 billion.  Arcaro is not the only BitConnect bigwig to face consequences for his role in the scheme: BitConnect’s founder, Satish Kumbhani, has been indicted on a host of felony charges, including conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit price manipulation, operating an unlicensed money transmitter and conspiracy to launder funds internationally. Kumbhani was also sued separately by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in September 2021.  However, bringing the BitConnect founder to justice has proved to be a difficult task. Kumbhani, an Indian citizen, disappeared last February after being indicted. Indian authorities confirmed in a legal filing last March that Kumbhani had vanished from India and was assumed to have relocated to another, unknown country.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/13/bitconnects-victims-to-receive-17m-in-restitution-seized-from-scams-promoter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e56ea40c018c677c8cb3ed3e342ac5d4ecf38c7a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

7503958,https://newsbtc.com/?p=515980,1673627438,Chainlink Bullish Divergence: What To Expect In 2023,"The Chainlink price has had a somewhat mediocre performance over the past few months. Once a cryptocurrency that was within the top 10 by market capitalization, LINK has currently slipped to 22nd place. However, within the next few months, Chainlink could be poised to outperform other cryptocurrencies. In addition to the fundamentals, LINK’s weekly chart shows an extremely bullish occurrence. The chart reveals that the LINK price has formed a bullish divergence with the RSI on a weekly basis. The bullish divergence is shown by the fact that the price has recently fallen to new local lows, while the RSI is not making a new low. This shows that the bears are losing power and that the LINK bulls are ready to control the market again. Ultimately, the bullish divergence could signal the end of the prolonged downtrend. However, in the short term, there could be another drawdown for LINK. The 4-hour chart is showing a bearish divergence as the price is making new local highs while RSI is trending down, making new lower lows. Although the market is taking a bullish stance on Chainlink, the discrepancy means that momentum is slowing. Chainlink Relies On Strong Fundamentals In 2023 A bullish catalyst in 2023 might become Chainlink’s low-latency pull-based oracles. Instead of regularly pushing data to the chain based on predefined conditions, the oracle reports will be made available off-chain and added to the chain by users as they are needed. Related Reading: Chainlink Bullish Signal: LINK Address Activity Returns To 2021 Levels This technical improvement was announced by Chainlink in early November. As Chainlink’s community ambassador “ChainLinkGod” wrote on Twitter, this has massive implications for dApp users and developers. They can use the technology to increase leverage, lower trading fees, and improve the UX. Additionally, the oracle reports can be kept private until transactions are settled on the chain. “Combined with the high-frequency nature of the data, oracle frontrunning can be mitigated,” the ambassador says. This is a game-changer, especially for decentralized derivatives protocols, which could see a massive influx in 2023 given the antics and collapses of centralized exchanges in 2022, as it makes them more competitive. Related Reading: Chainlink Nears Crucial $6 Level As LINK Ushers In The New Year The LINK price could benefit from the hype and increased usage, as well as from the partnership with SWIFT. As announced in late September 2022, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) has partnered with Chainlink to connect the global financial ecosystem to almost any blockchain. The World Economic Forum estimates that up to 10% of global GDP will be stored and transacted via distributed ledger technologies by 2027, and tokenized markets could be worth up to $24 trillion by 2027, according to a new report. If Chainlink could be a part of this development alongside SWIFT, the LINK bulls can easily take over and push the price upward.

42414691,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBDPqe,1673626683,Circulating Supply for The Graph’s GRT Token Jumps With Major Framework Ventures Unlock,"The circulating supply for The Graph, a data query protocol for blockchains, jumped over 1% this week after venture backer Framework withdrew 99 million GRT tokens worth some $7 million – the address’s biggest withdrawal ever – from The Graph’s GRT staking contract.  On Jan. 9, Framework Ventures sent 99 million GRT, worth roughly $7 million, to Coinbase moments after triggering transactions to withdraw from The Graph’s GRT staking contract and token lockup contract.  By withdrawing tokens from The Graph’s Token Lockup contract, Framework Ventures increased the circulating supply of The Graph’s GRT token, which currently stands at some 7.4 billion, data from CoinGecko and Messari shows.  Simply withdrawing its tokens from a staking contract may mean Framework may be forgoing future staking profits.  The number of GRT transferred by Framework Ventures is among the 10 largest GRT transactions in at least the past 12 months, per Nansen.  A transfer of this size “is enormous, accounting for 1% of the circulation,” said CryptoQuant’s Web3 analyst, Bradley Park, in a Telegram conversation with CoinDesk.  Even so, GRT has hovered around US7 cents since the Jan. 9 transfers, with no major downside movements.  This is the second time Framework prompted transactions to withdraw from The Graph’s GRT staking contract and token lockup contract, with the first time occurring on Oct. 10 (tx1, tx2 and tx3).  On Jan. 9, at 11:38:35 p.m. UTC, a Framework Ventures wallet triggered a transaction to withdraw 99 million GRT from The Graph’s Staking Proxy contract and into a Token Lockup contract. Framework then transferred the $7 million sum to a wallet under its control before ultimately sending it to Coinbase. Nansen had labeled each 0x address.  Framework Ventures has been a long-time backer of The Graph. In the summer of 2020, The Graph raised $5 million in a token sale with Framework Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group and others.  The Graph, which indexes and queries blockchain data, has 19 active developers, according to Artemis Analytics. Its GRT token is “used to secure and govern the network and to incentivize behaviors that are critical for the network to thrive,” as stated in The Graph’s white paper.  It's impossible to know if Framework has sold its GRT tokens on Coinbase; the fund did not return a request for comment by press time.  Staking rewards on The Graph Network vary, depending on what indexer or node operator a user decides to choose when staking their GRT tokens. The estimated APR for the top 10 indexers by revenue range from as low as 7.01% to as high as 10.99%, at press time.  Framework co-founder Vance Spencer has previously spoken about his fund’s long-term buy-and-hold mantra for those he considers to be a “really good team.”  “Our bias is to just basically hold that until infinity, and we do that with probably 90% to 95% of the Framework Ventures book,” he said in an April 2021 episode of the ""UpOnly"" podcast.

Still, the downfall of crypto exchange FTX ( FTT-USD ) dented trust in the industry, he added.

Related Reading: Vital Levels To Keep Eye On As Cardano Price Begins To Retreat On January 12, Input Output Global (IOG), a blockchain engineering firm created by Charles Hoskinson and formerly known as Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), made the announcement. The official technical documentation for the sidechain toolkit was also released in the announcement. Great move by @InputOutputHK I believe this help spread the usage of Sidechains for Cardano which is a good strategy if it evolves to use mithril / state proofs As a core contributor to @Milkomeda_com we will continue to lead 🫡 and hopefully support others to join https://t.co/auqp2TkEg1 — nicoarq (@NicoArqueros) January 12, 2023 As a “proof-of-concept,” IOG developers have already used the toolkit to build an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible sidechain public testnet. Once the audit is complete, developers will be able to deploy decentralized applications, create smart contracts, and transfer tokens between testing chains. In addition to other application-specific capabilities, the toolkit will permit sidechain developers to select their consensus process. Mainnet Growth The IOG developers have also revealed that they have used the toolkit to build a proof of concept on a public testnet that is compatible with the EVM sidechain. Moreover, once the audit is complete, developers can launch dApps and smart contracts and transfer tokens between different test chains. Finally, the announcement notes that sidechain creators can use the toolkit to choose the consensus mechanism that best suits their app. The term “mainnet” refers to the parent blockchain, while “sidechain” describes a blockchain that operates independently of the mainnet. While the primary blockchain focuses on safety and decentralization, a sidechain can help the network scale. Related Reading: Cardano Up 30% Since December As 28 New Whales Hold At least 1 Million ADA In the long run, IOG expects this new development to lead to widespread adoption of the Cardano network, facilitating the launch of multiple Cardano sidechains and partner chains. Meanwhile, Charles Hoskinson, the creator of ADA, has proposed that Solana joins Cardano as a “partner chain.” Hoskinson shared this during a recent “ask me anything” session. He claims that there would be synergies between the two blockchains. For example, Solana can take advantage of Cardano’s security and infrastructure, while Cardano can take advantage of Solana’s faster network. Fans’ Anticipation In Cardano Community The announcement has been met with positivity from Cardano supporters, with one member of the community anticipating a price increase on par with Ethereum in recent years when several layer-2 sidechains and utility tokens were introduced. 2023 is the Year of #Cardano sidechains – Midnight privacy sidechain – Sidechains Toolkit EVM compatible – Milkomeda, first Cardano sidechain – …more to come Do you remember what happened when people started to build sidechains/tokens on Ethereum?

For example, the security model, bridge experience, and SPO rewards structure are just a few. The team did say, though, that it was looking forward to community input and participation in these improvements. According to its roadmap, Cardano will introduce parallel accounting systems to promote sidechains. This release is part of the Basho update that will allow for ADA’s network compatibility. IOG’s development of this toolkit marks their second sidechain solution for it. IOG already implemented a simpler EVM-compatible sidechain in July to start the sidechain work on Cardano, so this isn’t the first sidechain solution they’ve integrated. Additionally, in September, Cardano experienced its most crucial hard fork yet, the Vasil upgrade, which has been said to facilitate the cheaper and more efficient deployment of smart contracts and the operation of decentralized applications. As of press time, ADA is trading at $0.3312, a 22.14% increase from the prior week’s price, with a 24-hour trading volume of $448 million.

A “liquidation” takes place when a derivative exchange has to forcibly close up a contract on the Bitcoin futures market. Contracts usually liquidate when a certain percentage of the margin – the collateral amount that the holder had to put up in order to open the position, is lost due to the BTC price moving opposite to the direction the investor bets on. In the crypto futures market, large liquidations happening at once isn’t an uncommon sight due to a couple of reasons. First, most of the assets in the sector are generally very volatile, so sudden price swings can take place without warning. And second, many derivative exchanges offer leverage (a loan amount taken against the margin) as high as 100x in the original position. High leverage being accessible in a volatile environment like this results in a large risk of positions being liquidated. Related Reading: Ethereum Rallies Above $1,400 As Sharks Accumulate Now, the relevant indicator here is the “total futures liquidations,” which tracks the total amount of both short and long liquidations that are taking place in the Bitcoin futures market currently. Here is a chart that shows the trend in this metric over the last few months: The value of the metric seems to have been deep red in recent days | Source: Glassnode on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin futures liquidations have mostly involved short contracts in the last few days. This trend makes sense, as a sharp upwards move in the price was the trigger for these liquidations. During the FTX crash back in November, which observed the opposite kind of price move, a large number of longs were wiped out instead, as can be seen from the chart. Related Reading: Chainlink Bullish Signal: LINK Address Activity Returns To 2021 Levels Usually, a large enough rapid move in the price can trigger simultaneous mass liquidations that only feed said price move further. This amplified price move then liquidates even more contracts, and in this way, liquidations cascade together. A mass liquidation event like this is popularly called a “squeeze.” Glassnode notes that $93 million in short contracts were flushed in just a single hour during the past day. These rapid liquidations suggest the Bitcoin rally triggered a short squeeze in the futures market. The price has now shot up even more following this squeeze, as is generally the case, and BTC is now above $19,000 for the first time since the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX.

Following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas and then extradited to the U.S. to face a number of charges from federal prosecutors. A U.S. judge in late December released Bankman-Fried on $250 million bail backed by his parents and two other parties whom his lawyers requested remain anonymous, citing privacy and safety concerns.  “The public’s interest in this matter cannot be overstated,” said one filing made Thursday to U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in the Southern District of New York on behalf of the Associated Press, Bloomberg, Financial Times, CNBC, Reuters, Dow Jones (publisher of the Wall Street Journal) and Washington Post, among others. ""Mr. Bankman-Fried stands accused of perpetrating one of the largest financial frauds in history.""  ""Any purported interest in keeping these names secret or private is outweighed by the tremendous public interest in the identities of these individuals,” law firm Kolis said in a separate legal filing made on behalf of CoinDesk.  ""The public has a clear and powerful interest in who these allies may be,"" the filing continued.

As a result, Bitfarms is looking to modify the loan.  The original loan for $32 million was signed in February 2022 by Backbone Mining Solutions, a Bitfarms company that operates a 20 megawatt (MW) mining site in Washington state.  The loan now has $20 million outstanding and is secured by only $5 million in assets, in the form of some mining machines and the bitcoin they produce. So the miner is looking for more favorable terms on the loan and reducing its obligations.  ""Neither a restructuring on more beneficial loan terms nor a reduction in BMS’s indebtedness is assured,"" the Friday press release said.  Canada-based Bitfarms has been working to reduce its loans, but still has $47 million outstanding, including the loan with BlockFi.  Miners have been haunted by their heavy debt obligations in a bear market that has seen the value of their collateral, usually crypto assets and mining machines, plummet. Two of the biggest firms in the industry, Compute North and Core Scientific (CORZ), have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.  As of the end of 2022, Bitfarms had $36 million in cash and unencumbered crypto.  The stock is down over 5% at 95 cents in pre-market trading.

The regulator took aim at Gemini Earn, the troubled interest-bearing product that hundreds of thousands of U.S. investors entrusted with their crypto. Gemini generated yield on billions of dollars in crypto by loaning deposits to Genesis, which loaned them out again. (Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)

Overall, the fund has a cost average of $254.65 for the shares, which closed at $47.55, up 8.6%, on Thursday. Analysts on average have a price target of $61.46, according to data compiled by FactSet.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the daily dollar value of short bets in the bitcoin futures market liquidated since August.  On Thursday, centralized exchanges liquidated short positions worth $61.8 million, the highest since Sept. 9, taking out overleveraged bears from the market as bitcoin jumped to a two-month high of $19,097.  Liquidations happen when traders cannot fulfill margin requirements for holding long/short positions and often exacerbate bullish/bearish moves.  – Omkar Godbole     Trending Posts  FTX Cleared to Sell LedgerX, Japanese Units by Bankruptcy Judge  Crypto Traders Are Already Placing Bets on Ethereum’s 'Shanghai Hard Fork'  US House Republicans to Set Up Crypto Committee to Oversee Shaky Industry: Report",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,"Lyllah Ledesma, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/13/first-mover-americas,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/34a1974b62b42504d086a6a4d5cacd44210a0499-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Law enforcement searched four call centers and 18 other places and arrested 14 people in Serbia and one in Germany.  ""The network operated professionally to set up call centers, which defrauded numerous victims in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Australia and Canada for at least tens of millions of euros,"" Eurojust said in the statement.  ""Overall, more than 250 persons were interviewed and over 150 computers, various electronic equipment and data back-ups, three cars, two luxury apartments and $1 million in cryptocurrencies and 50 000 euros in cash were seized,"" it said.  The operation involved attracting potential investors online, contacting them by phone and luring them into making small investments that made initial gains. Victims were then encouraged to invest more money, which they subsequently lost.  The criminals operated the call centers from Serbia, using technological infrastructure in Bulgaria and laundered the proceeds in Cyprus.  Investment scams involving crypto are often popular with criminal networks because they can target victims seeking to make sizable short-term financial gains. In December, authorities in Italy and Albania busted a suspected crypto investment scam that was estimated to have netted 15 million euros ($16 million).

MANA’s price increased 12% in the past 24 hours and was trading at 44 cents at press time. The token is up nearly 38% in a week, although it is still down 92% from its all-time high of $5.85 in November 2021, according to crypto price tracker CoinGecko.  The price jump came as Decentraland introduced new features for users on Thursday. The update introduces new profile features and avatar functions, Decentraland shared in a tweet. The update didn't directly increase Decentraland user numbers or change the MANA token’s value proposition.  Decentraland is a virtual-reality platform where users can buy land and create virtual structures such as concert halls and poker rooms and charge visitors for the experience. The project recently drew scrutiny for its unimpressive user numbers.  Cryptocurrencies with smaller market capitalizations have been outperforming bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) recently as sentiment has improved in the broader crypto markets because of positive macroeconomic data.  The CoinDesk Culture and Entertainment (CNE) sector index, which includes metaverse tokens such as MANA, has gained 37% since the start of the year, becoming the best-performing asset class among CoinDesk’s sector indexes. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which tracks the performance of the broad crypto market, is up 18% during the same period.  Other major metaverse tokens have put up impressive gains in the past week. The Sandbox’s native SAND jumped 31.3%, while Gala Games’s GALA more than doubled, CoinDesk data shows.

7495996,https://newsbtc.com/?p=515975,1673613050,"Near Protocol (NEAR) Surges Over 22% In One Week, Will It Surpass $2?","NEAR is soaring on the price chart, with a 3.10% increase in the last 24 hours. Even with the bearish nature of the crypto market in 2022, the NEAR protocol started the year strong. The adverse events of 2022 pushed cryptocurrencies under the scrutiny of regulators. However, the market is slowly picking up pace this 2023. According to a Coin Guru tweet, NEAR is moving upwards, gaining 4.92% in 1 hour. NEAR is a cryptocurrency project designed to be community-based. It is a cloud-computing platform that enables faster transactions and interaction among blockchains. Related Reading: BONK Tumbles 66% – Can The ‘Dogecoin Killer’ Live Up To Its Name? What Is Behind The Price Surge? Several factors might be responsible for this increase in the price of NEAR tokens. Web3 innovations top the list of these factors. Web3 has taken over the crypto space with various applications such as gaming, NFTs, fast transactions, etc., and NEAR is at its frontlines. NEAR is home to almost 1,000 projects. SweatEconomy is one of its renowned apps with a customer base of over 14 million individuals. The NEAR Protocol development team also hinted that its sharding mechanism, Nightshade, would launch in 2023. Also, NEAR Protocol gives users an enabling environment to transact seamlessly. Statistics reveal that 22.6 million #NEAR wallets have been created since late 2020. The protocol also supports the staking of NEAR tokens. With its innovative thinking and support of widely adopted decentralized applications (DApps), the attention on NEAR is soaring. However, Alex, a Twitter user, was pessimistic about NEAR and its projects. In an opinion poll, he stated his intention to expose a potential rug-pull event on the network if followers supported the action. 95.7% have voted yes in support of the exposure. But Alex is yet to go into details of this particular project. Some users believe he intends to create FUD in the market. What Next For NEAR Protocol Token? NEAR is performing well in the market today, trading at $1.81. The support levels are $1.378, $1.468, and $1.647, while the resistance levels are $1.917, $2.01, and $2.19. The token will test the first resistance level and will likely surpass it based on current performance. NEAR is currently trading above its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA); so more positive price movement is expected in the short term. It is still below its 200-day SMA, indicating a possible reversal in the long term for the crypto asset. The price chart shows that the token broke out of a sideways trend and will likely continue its ascent. Related Reading: Stellar (XLM) Poised To Rally?

The Moving Average Convergence/ Divergence (MACD) is above its signal line but still looks tentative. It further proves that the rally will only sustain for the short term. Near will likely reach the first resistance level of $1.905, yielding a profit for long-position traders.

That has sharply reduced the circulating supply of the cryptocurrency and has increased the uncertainty regarding the blockchain’s future, the report said.  “However, several key metrics such as active addresses and daily non-fungible-token (NFT) volume have returned to pre-FTX-collapse levels, potentially indicating comfort from some users on the chain,” analysts from Citi Research led by Joseph Ayoub wrote.  Citi says developers have remained active on the blockchain as the tokens of a new project called Bonk were airdropped to solana holders last week. An airdrop is when free tokens are sent to wallet addresses to promote adoption of a new cryptocurrency.  Solana’s main challenge is incentivizing users and developers to stay, the note said, observing that DeGods, its largest NFT collection, left the chain last month, citing doubts about the network's future.  Through the end of last year, Solana's token underwent a “slow burn lower” before slumping as much as 20% on Dec. 29. The next day, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin expressed his support for the blockchain, causing SOL's price to almost double in the following weeks, with about $550 million of short liquidations over the same period, the note added.

42413121,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7tcq,1673608754,Cardano Developer IOG Deploys Sidechain Toolkit to Boost Blockchain,"The company behind the Cardano blockchain said it has deployed a toolkit for building custom sidechains, allowing developers to create blockchains for specific use cases on the system.  The toolkit, available initially on a testnet – a blockchain that mimics real-world usage, will allow the sidechains to benefit from Cardano's security and decentralization as well as from the support of the existing community, Input Output Global said Thursday. Sidechains are separate blockchains built on, but running independently of, a main blockchain.  Cardano joins Polkadot in offering the framework, which allows developers to experiment with niche applications in a live environment without compromising the main network. Sidechains can increase the transaction capacity, enabling more data to be processed without increasing the risk of network downtime.  IOG said its goal with the toolkit is to extend Cardano's capabilities by making it more scalable without compromising the stability or security of the main chain. The toolkit allows for the creation of sidechains, each with its own consensus algorithm, meaning applications built on a sidechain won't depend on Cardano’s network rules to function.  The sidechains are connected to the main chain through a bridge that allows asset transfer between the chains.

42413128,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7tga,1673607579,Bitcoin's 'Volatility Smile' Shows Increased Demand for Bullish Exposure,"Bitcoin's (BTC) recent double-digit rally has sparked a positive sentiment shift among crypto options traders.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value has gained 13% this month, topping the $19,000 mark for the first time since Nov. 8, CoinDesk data shows.  Tumbling U.S. inflation, weaker U.S. dollar, and expectations for slower Federal Reserve rate hikes have helped the cryptocurrency look past the lingering fallout from FTX's collapse.  And consistent with the resilient rally, bitcoin options' ""volatility smile"" shows the demand for out-of-the-money (OTM) call options – bullish bets at strikes higher than the cryptocurrency's going market price – has increased relative to puts or bearish bets.  ""BTC's short-dated OTM calls have seen an increase in implied volatility compared to OTM puts. This continues the trend of the volatility smile towards a more neutral smile, which was previously driven by a falling demand for downside protection [puts] throughout December,"" Andrew Melville, research analyst at crypto derivatives analytics firm Block Scholes, wrote in a note published Thursday.  ""It indicates that BTC's derivatives market is now not only pricing for a drop in bearish sentiment but is reflecting an increase in demand for exposure to upwards movements,"" Melville added.  The bullish shift perhaps reflects confidence among sophisticated market participants that bitcoin's rally to two-month highs may be only the first milestone in its upward trajectory.  The volatile smile is a graphical representation of implied volatility for a series of bullish call and bearish put options at different strikes but with the same underlying and expiration date. Implied volatility (IV) or projected volatility is the market's expectation of the future price turbulence of the underlying asset and is directly influenced by supply and demand for call and put options.  A U-shaped line is formed sloping upwards on both ends, which resembles a smile, when IVs for options at different strike prices are plotted. The simplest explanation for the U-shape is demand for out-of-the-money (OTM) and in-the-money (ITM) call and put options is typically higher than for at-the-money (ATM) call and put options, as Patrick Boyle and Jesse McDougall wrote in the book ""Trading and Pricing Financial Derivatives.""  Call options above BTC's going market price, currently $18,850, are known as OTM, while those below the spot price are ITM. The opposite is the case for puts, with options above the spot price known as ITM while those below called OTM. Call and put options at strikes at around the spot price are ATM options.  Bitcoin's volatility smile  The chart by Block Scholes shows bitcoin's 30-day volatility smile on Dec. 5 (blue line), Jan. 6 (gray line) and Jan. 12 (yellow line).  On Dec. 6, the volatile smile looked more like a smirk, with greater implied volatility on options at lower strikes, a sign of stronger demand for downside protection.  The smirk had since vanished due to a decline in demand for puts and an increase in demand for calls.  ""Last week, we reported that the move towards a more neutral volatility smile for BTC was due to a drop in the IV of OTM puts rather than an increase in the IV of OTM calls. At the same time, we noted that a fall in implied vol across all strikes saw the implied volatility of the entire smile drop,"" Melville noted.  ""Since then, we have seen a rise in the IV of OTM calls to the same levels they recorded at the beginning of December. However, OTM puts have remained at their lower levels, resulting in a reduction in the smile's skew,"" Melville added.

42413123,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7tdm,1673606593,Inside Bonk Inu: How 22 Developers Put the Shiba Inu Fun Into Solana and Away From FTX,"In the past few weeks, a Shiba inu-themed token took center stage in the Solana ecosystem as sentiment around the blockchain network took a hit in the aftermath of the Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX debacle.  Called Bonk inu (BONK), the project with a cute dog holding a bat as a mascot, launched with just a homepage and a “bonkpaper” in the final weeks of 2022.  But the lack of clear team information or even a dedicated community channel didn’t deter entrants from punting their hopes: BONK ran up as much as 3,200% in just three weeks, almost single-handedly inciting activity in the Solana ecosystem, as previously reported.  Bonk Inu became the talk of Crypto Twitter almost overnight with almost everyone wondering the same thing, “What is Bonk anyway?”  Bonk Inu is a team of 22 individuals with no singular leader, all of whom were involved in the inception of the project, CoinDesk learned from one of the several developers. All of them have previously built decentralized applications (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFT) and other related products on Solana.  “There is no core team. It’s all volunteers,” said KW, a pseudonymous Bonk Inu team member, during a chat with CoinDesk. “We’ve all been in the Solana ecosystem for a long time and built relationships over the last two years.”  The bonk airdrop – amounting to 50% of its token supply – likely drove massive community interest and instant hype. Some 20% of the total airdrop supply is going to Solana NFT collections – comprising 297,000 individual NFTs – and 10% to Solana-focused artists and collectors. Airdrops refer to an unsolicited distribution of a cryptocurrency token or coin, usually for free, to numerous wallet addresses and are generally used as a tactic to gain users.  See also: Shiba Inu-Themed BONK Tokens Are Yielding Nearly 1,000% for Solana Liquidity Providers  But why Bonk Inu?  For background: Bankman-Fried had been among the most vocal supporters of Solana since early 2020, launching the decentralized exchange Serum on the network, publicly offering to buy all the SOL he could get his hands on at $3, and investing hundreds of millions in the network through funds such as Sino Global Capital.  The charade lasted all of two years.  Distraught, disgusted, and jaded: That was the prevailing sentiment on Crypto Twitter when reports of possible fraud at SBF’s then-behemoth crypto exchange FTX first broke out in November.  Once the darling of the crypto space, the main players running Bankman-Fried’s FTX pleaded guilty or were arrested for concocting an elaborate scheme that commingled billions of dollars in customer deposits to fund trading activities at closely-related Alameda Research, of which SBF was a co-founder.  FTX and Alameda have since been taken over by liquidators. SBF was arrested and await trial later this year. Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang, a key FTX engineer, pleaded guilty as part of a deal with prosecutors. And Solana’s SOL tokens fell to as low as $9 as a known player of the ecosystem went down – contributing to a hit in sentiment.  Read more: Why Solana Was Decimated by Bankman-Fried’s Downfall  The 22 Solana developers, however, took no time to distance themselves from Bankman-Fried’s dirt and rebuilt conversation around the decentralized network. They instead banded together to build a “community coin” – and with that, a dog-themed protocol was the way to go.  There’s no rival  The team does not see itself as a dogecoin (DOGE) or shiba inu (SHIB) rival and points out BONK is already different from the gazillions of dog-themed meme coins already in the market.  “It's already more useful than either of those. There’s (not) much you can do with SHIB or DOGE on-chain,” KW stated, adding there are over 50 integrations with other projects for using BONK already.  The integrations include use cases ranging from minting NFTs to using BONK to trade futures and options to betting with BONK at Solana-based Casino, and eventually buying a Solana Saga mobile directly with BONK.  As such, the developers have no imminent plans of creating a bespoke blockchain network around Bonk Inu, unlike Shiba Inu’s upcoming Shibarium protocol. For them, it’s all about increasing Solana’s transactional usage and showcasing the benefits of the cheap network.  “There is no reason to make a new blockchain because Solana is fast, cheap and scales,” KW said. “[We want to] drive attention to all the amazing stuff being built on Solana. Support the Solana ecosystem with the [decentralized autonomous organization] funds.”  Fees on Solana run into fractions of a penny per transaction, compared to a few dollars on Ethereum, which is expensive for widespread usage.  As such, Solana Labs nor the Solana Foundation were involved in Bonk Inu’s creation, the developer said.  The Bonk Inu plan has seemed to work, so far. Research from Delphi Digital earlier this week noted that total active wallets interacting with Solana-based exchanges have increased 83% from almost 45,000 per day to over 83,000 per day.  “The increase in activity comes without any fundamental change or catalyst for the network,” Delphi analysts said in the report, noting the issuance of BONK in late December. However, they did not cite bonk tokens as a key reason behind the Solana resurgence.  BONK's price, meanwhile, has taken a hit as the initial hype has worn down. The price is down 80% since last week’s peak, CoinGecko data shows, when the tokens reached a market capitalization of over $150 million.  But the likes of KW aren’t concerned: “We are super excited this has drawn attention back to what matters on Solana, its incredible infrastructure and a solid community of users and builders that are going to make more amazing things over time.""",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB | SOL | BONK,BLOCKCHAIN | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | BONK,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/13/inside-bonk-inu-how-22-developers-put-the-shiba-inu-fun-into-solana-and-away-from-ftx,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0542ee978f6a45024c13e89e50fdbbf0d7992546-1024x1024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Despite this development, as evidenced by a combined crypto market valuation increase of 3.4% to $880 billion as of Thursday, Solana’s newly minted canine-centered memecoin BONK has experienced a huge price decline relative to its competitors. As of writing, BONK is trading at $0.000000968754, and down a whopping 66% in the last seven days, data by Coingecko show. In the last 24 hours alone, BONK has lost 1.6% of its value. Chart: Coingecko BONK Succumbs To Bearish Pressure Despite its initial success, the memecoin BONK has had a difficult go of it in the weeks following its launch. The token, which appeared out of nowhere and quickly rose to rank among the top 200 cryptocurrencies in terms of market value, was hit hard by a significant bearish trend around Thursday afternoon. It has significantly outpaced the market since the beginning of the year, on the heels of a retail buy-up that pitted the dog-themed cryptocurrency against existing meme coin heavyweights Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). There have been claims of wealthy investors purchasing millions, if not billions, of the viral coin BONK during the past few of weeks. Consequently, Thursday’s drop is a shock to investors with high aspirations for the cryptocurrency. This week, BONK became the latest meme token to attract the attention of traders with a huge 3,300% increase. Following that, the developers of the cryptocurrency burnt their remaining tokens, which represented 5% of the whole BONK cryptocurrency supply. Chart: TradingView Dogecoin Rival Leans On Solana Community’s Support BONK was introduced on December 25, 2022, and its price has since increased by a four-digit proportion. Additionally, the token dominated social trading platforms. Analysts attributed the new token’s success to the Solana community. The token’s value has been struggling to bounce back from its 66% loss in the face of continued negative growth rate, which caused it to give up some of the gains it made over the previous weeks. When we zoom in on BONK’s growth during the past two weeks, we see that it has increased by almost 1,000% throughout this period.

Since October 2021, Stellar has also been in a descending trend channel. At press time, XLM was trading at $0.0822. Thus, the price is showing initial signs of strength and could make a first attempt to break through the upper line of the trend channel at $0.10.

Their preference is for the liquidation of the firm, saying it better serves their interests, according to the filing prepared by Hodlnaut's interim judicial managers, Bloomberg said Friday.  The proposed restructuring plan would have allowed Hodlnaut directors who were at the helm during its collapse to continue managing the company. Liquidation would ""maximize the company's remaining assets available for distribution,"" one of the creditors, Algorand Foundation, wrote in the filing.  Hodlnaut froze withdrawals in August and was placed under interim judicial management (IJM), a form of debt restructuring in which another entity manages a distressed business and its property and assets.  The lender's woes emanated from the collapse of Terra ecosystem last year, to which Hodlnaut directors downplayed their exposure, the judicial managers said. The firm had in fact converted a significant amount of crypto to terraUSD (UST), which brought about losses of about $190 million, according to the IJM.  Terra’s downfall had far-reaching ramifications across the crypto market, setting off a chain of crypto firms collapsing, including prominent hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and crypto lenders Celsius Network and Voyager Digital.

Related Reading: XRP Tops List Of Gainers As Whale Interest Spikes Since the CPI data had come in exactly as expected at 6.5%, it meant that there was a flush between shorts and longs, and this flush is also present in the ratio of liquidations. Data from Coinglass shows that while short traders are still suffering the most losses, the gap with longs is not that wide as shorts made up 58% of the losses. Market liquidations cross $200 million | Source: Coinglass Still, this is significant in the market and if bitcoin were to continue its upward rally, then it is likely that the gap between long and short losses would become much wider. It is also important to note that most of the liquidations actually happened on Thursday, only a couple of hours after the CPI release. Over 39,000 traders have seen their positions liquidated with the largest single liquidation event happening on the ETH-USDT-SWAP on the OKX exchange. Bitcoin, Ethereum Tie For Liquidations On a 24-hour period, the bitcoin liquidations have surpassed that of Ethereum but ever so slightly. Where 4,230 BTC have been liquidated, culminating in a total loss of $79.56 million over the time period, 51,000 ETH has been liquidation, worth $71.79 million. As the bitcoin price looks to have settled into support above $18,000 over the last 12 hours, ETH liquidations have taken the lead with $9.08 million lost so far compared to BTC’s $8.23 million for the same time period. There have been more swings in ETH’s price during this time, which is the driving force behind more liquidations. ETH liquidations surpass BTC liquidations | Source: Coinglass Since bitcoin has now moved above its 50-day moving average but continues to struggle with its 100-day MA, there could be some more wild swings to come before the crypto market finally settles. From here, it is likely to be an upward swing before a correction back into the $17,000 territory.

Other proposed improvements already locked in include smaller transaction sizes – which help speed up transactional times – and smart contracts functionality that could allow Bitcoin Cash-based applications built that offer recurring payments, derivatives trading, and crowdfunding opportunities, among other uses, to Bitcoin Cash users.  Mechanism Capital founder Andrew Kang noted on Twitter the fundamental improvements coupled with a general bottoming of BCH's price set the runway for a price surge in the coming weeks. “Charts look insanely bottomed and ready for impulse,” Kang tweeted.

Chainlink Daily Active Addresses At High Levels Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, this increase in LINK activity first started around two months ago. The relevant indicator here is the “daily active addresses,” which tells us the total number of addresses that were involved in a transaction on any given day. The metric counts both senders and receivers in its calculation, and only accounts for unique addresses in the data, meaning that the wallets that participated in multiple transfers on the same day are only counted once. This helps remove duplicate transactions and other noise from the data, and provides a more accurate picture of the network activity. When the value of this indicator is high, it means a large number of daily users are interacting in some way on the blockchain right now. Such a trend shows the market is active currently. On the other hand, low values of the metric imply not many unique users are showing trading activity at the moment. This kind of trend can be a sign that the general interest around the crypto is low at the moment. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Chainlink daily active addresses over the last few years: Looks like the value of the metric has been elevated in recent weeks | Source: Santiment on Twitter As shown in the above graph, the Chainlink daily active addresses were at pretty low levels for most of 2022. This was because the investors weren’t finding the coin that interesting to trade during the bear market consolidation. Related Reading: Altcoin Volume Dominance At Highest Since Jan 2021, Trouble For Bitcoin? In the last couple of months or so, however, there has been a very noticeable rise in the unique users transacting on the network daily. In fact, these values of the indicator are similar to those seen during 2021, when the bull run was going on. Usually, high network activity is bullish for the price in the long term as increased utility of the chain builds a more sustainable ground for the future. LINK has been rallying in the last week or so, which may suggest that this high activity from holders in the last two months may already be paying off for the crypto. Related Reading: Ethereum Rallies Above $1,400 As Sharks Accumulate Also, while a high number of users are important for starting price moves like this, it’s also true that they are needed during such rallies to keep them going. If the Chainlink daily active addresses continue to be at the current high levels, then it may mean the current rally can keep up the momentum for a while longer.

Investment bank Perella Weinberg is now allowed to start the sale process, which also includes the crypto exchange’s European and Japanese units, and which have already attracted as many as 117 expressions of interest.  In formal terms, the judicial decision allows bids, an auction, and a sales hearing to take place, with permission for any actual transaction to come later. Judge John Dorsey of the Delaware Bankruptcy Court, charged with overseeing the wind-up of the exchange, approved the measures in an order dated Thursday after a hearing held Wednesday. Sale notices will be published within around three business days, with indications of interest to be received between Jan. 18 for Embed and Feb. 1 for FTX Europe and Japan.  During Wednesday's hearing, Dorsey characterized the process as FTX ""trying to dip their toe into the water to see what happens [and] see what kind of interest they receive.""  Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto enterprise filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11, 2022, shortly after a CoinDesk report scrutinized the integrity of FTX trading arm Alameda Research’s balance sheet.  Claims linked to former senior executives and their families will be excluded from the sale, given concerns from the Department of Justice about sales where there have been serious allegations of wrongdoing. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to charges including wire fraud while serving as chief executive officer, while his former lieutenants Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang are said to be cooperating with investigators.  The estate, now run by restructuring expert John Ray, hopes to generate more value for creditors by speedily selling off the more solvent and easy-to-separate arms of the business.

42413115,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7tVM,1673583953,Crypto Traders Are Already Placing Bets on Ethereum’s 'Shanghai Hard Fork',"Ethereum’s historic shift last year to a proof-of-stake network – known as “the Merge” – was one of the biggest stories of the year in crypto markets.  Now all eyes are on Ethereum’s next major upgrade, expected to take place in March, known as the “Shanghai hard fork,” which will allow participants on the network to unlock ether (ETH) they had staked on the blockchain, inaccessible for months.  The decision to push forward with Shanghai was announced in December, overshadowed at the time by sour sentiment as the crypto industry dealt with fallout from the epic collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange.  A new year has arrived, perhaps bringing a clean slate, and crypto analysts are sharpening their pencils to figure out how ether might trade through Ethereum’s next big milestone.  Ether was recently trading up 12% so far in 2023 to $1,410. Several governance tokens of top liquid staking products also rallied, with Lido DAO (LDO) jumping 53% in the past seven days and 92% in the past 30 days, according to data from CoinGecko.  But the uncertainty regarding Ethereum’s upgrade has also been floating around the market, with some traders commenting on the blockchain's current low staking ratio compared to other proof-of-stake blockchains. Will ETH stakers dump their tokens on the open market once they’re unlocked, or will they double down in a new era of widespread blockchain staking?  “The Merge was an important milestone and achievement for Ethereum,” Coin Metrics wrote in a newsletter note. “But in 2023 Ethereum ecosystem participants will also continue to grapple with the complex dynamics of proof of stake.”  CoinDesk spoke with five crypto traders and analysts to compile their key thoughts and predictions on the market impact of the Shanghai upgrade.  Crypto trader Thomas Kralow expects to see a short-term downside move for ETH right before and following the upgrade due to “the daily liquidity not keeping up with the supply of unstaked ETH.” He also notes “the fact that April is the deadline for taxes, which won’t help either because a lot of selling usually takes place during the tax period.” He predicted that the potential price drop wouldn’t amount to more than 15%-20% and that ETH should recover rapidly. According to Kralow, the Shanghai upgrade, if successful, will lay the foundation for another significant scaling upgrade – proto-danksharding, also known as EIP-4844 – later this year, which would make Ethereum more scalable through sharding. “Needless to say that such improvements will be incredibly bullish for Ethereum, and any short-term selling pressure will be bought up either entirely or at least partially,” he said.  Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at the digital-asset management firm Arca: “Most investors have heard of blockchain now and want to somehow make money if blockchain succeeds. For the last five years, almost every investor has tried to find different ways to express that theme. But for the first time ever, we're coming out of a bear market with real product market fit,” which includes four areas: bitcoin, stablecoins, non-fungible tokens (NFT) and decentralized finance (DeFi). “If you want to express all of those areas of blockchain with one investment, it would be Ethereum. It has wrapped bitcoin, the largest stablecoin presence, the largest NFT presence and the largest DeFi presence,” he said, adding: “In some ways, ETH is basically a crypto index now.” Dorman said he wouldn’t worry about the potential sell-off pressure from unlocking staked ETH following the upgrade: “There might be some pent-up demand to get liquidity from those who have had no liquidity for the last six or so months, but that will easily be replaced by people who didn't stake the first time because they needed liquidity.”  Lucas Outumuro, head of research at crypto data and analysis firm IntoTheBlock, wrote in a newsletter that ETH withdrawals will be processed through a queue with a maximum of approximately 43,000 staked ETH allowed to exit per day. “Based on this, it would take over a year for the 15.91 million ETH staked to be withdrawn, preventing mass withdrawals and mitigating selling pressure,” he said. “The fact that people staking may now be able to withdraw, even if they have to form part of a queue, could in turn encourage more people to stake.”  Kunal Goel, Messari's research analyst, wrote in a report that the total amount of ether staked will likely increase post-Shanghai. Goel pointed out that Ethereum remains the lowest staking ratio compared to other major proof-of-stake chains. (The staking ratio of other significant chains ranges between 46% and 97%.) After the Shanghai upgrade, a range of 30%-50% of Ethereum’s staking ratio “seems reasonable.” He also predicted that liquid staking protocols Lido and Rocket Pool will benefit from an increase in ETH's staking ratio after Shanghai, while decentralized trustless protocols should see secular growth.  Brent Xu, founder and CEO at Cosmos-based borrowing and lending platform Umee, expected “some sell pressure” after the Shanghai upgrade. He said that similar to Cosmos, Ethereum’s liquid staking derivatives currently face centralization risks that “not everyone trusts them,” though he expected after Shanghai upgrade, liquid staking derivatives will “significantly de-risk” ETH’s staking. He added: ""This is a dance between the proof-of-stake protocol readiness and how decentralized and how trusting people are of liquid staking protocols.”",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/13/crypto-traders-are-already-placing-bets-on-ethereums-shanghai-hard-fork,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6b3a3b010c973328adebef2d0dbe3e89c0e21b9c-1528x1021.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413111,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7tTU,1673578905,First Mover Asia: What's Next for Bitcoin After Biggest One-Day Price Pop in 2 Months?,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin (BTC) posted its biggest one-day return in two months, shooting up 5% to surpass the $19,000 level.  Insights: Security firms such as OpenZeppelin say blockchain bridges can benefit from security features built during the ongoing bear market can help prevent the huge attacks of 2022.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 926 +35.3 ▲ 4.0% Bitcoin (BTC) $18,872 +1007.2 ▲ 5.6% Ethereum (ETH) $1,417 +32.7 ▲ 2.4% S&P 500  3,983.17 +13.6 ▲ 0.3% Gold  $1,899 +24.8 ▲ 1.3% Nikkei 225  26,449.82 +3.8 ▲ 0.0% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  This week’s suddenly energetic crypto markets got an extra jolt Thursday from the U.S. government’s latest consumer price index (CPI) reading for December, showing a slowing pace of price rises to 6.5% on an annual basis. Many crypto traders and traditional economists took the report as a sign that the Federal Reserve can soon declare victory in its campaign to bring down inflation, which means risky assets won't have to face stiff monetary-policy tightening pressure for much longer.  Bitcoin (BTC) posted its biggest one-day return in two months, shooting up 5% to surpass the $19,000 level that the largest cryptocurrency hadn't seen since the market tremors first started to appear in the moments when Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange and crypto empire first started to unravel.  ""If we can take out that $19K level, then we are definitely en route for $21K,"" Julius de Kempenaer, senior technical analyst at StockCharts.com, told CoinDesk TV's ""All About Bitcoin"" show.  CoinDesk markets analyst Glenn Williams Jr. took a deep dive into the inflation figures and argues it might be too soon to get excited about a Fed pivot. Traders in fixed-income markets are pricing in expectations of a 0.25 percentage point hike at the Fed's next meeting – a slowdown from the recent pace. Fed officials assert that while the pace of hiking may slow, the campaign itself isn't on the verge of ending anytime soon – with many more hikes to come. ""The market does not believe that,"" Joe Orsini, vice president of research for Eaglebrook Advisors, told CoinDesk TV.  Dexterity Capital's Michael Safai said in emailed remarks that, this week's rally notwithstanding, the lingering malaise from last year's crypto-industry meltdown is just too much to shrug off, just yet. In fact, late Thursday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in a lawsuit that the crypto exchange Gemini and crypto lender Genesis Global Capital sold unregistered securities – adding to the drama and speculation over the future of Digital Currency Group (which also owns CoinDesk).  ""We still have a couple of big shakeouts left in crypto, with some bankruptcy messes that have to be sorted and other firms still fighting to stay solvent,"" Safai said. ""This will have a bigger impact on prices over the next couple of months.”  Insights  Crypto Bridges Had a Horrid 2022, But Security Firms Say This Year Doesn’t Have to Be as Bad  By Shaurya Malwa  A key part of the crypto ecosystem has received harsh criticism over the past several months because of its importance and yet fragile architecture, which led to an estimated $2 billion in losses in 2022.  Bridges, or blockchain-based tools that connect different networks, are essential for the movement of liquidity in the crypto ecosystem. Bridges allow users to transfer tokens and other digital assets, such as non-fungible tokens (NFT), between various chains – solving what was previously a difficult problem.  Bridges allow users to port assets across different blockchains, solving one of the main pain points – a lack of interoperability among the chains. And since blockchain assets are often not compatible with one another, bridges create synthetic derivatives that represent an asset from another blockchain.  This is where the potential for an exploit lies. Last year, February saw Wormhole’s $375 million exploit, followed by a $625 million exploit of Ronin Bridge the next month. Then in August, Nomad Bridge was attacked for $190 million.  However, security firms such as OpenZeppelin say bridges aren’t inherently susceptible to attacks and that security features built during the ongoing bear market make for an opportune time for developers to reinforce features.  “Cross-chain bridges need to maintain access to a large reserve of funds to underwrite the coins they wrap and transfer, so this makes them a prime target for attackers,” Michael Lewellen, head of solutions architecture at OpenZeppelin, told CoinDesk in a recent chat.  He added that while bridges may always remain a target for hackers, the usage of continuous security monitoring would make them less vulnerable. “Most bridges are inherently centralized in key areas so they have a lot of power available to respond to and contain attacks, but only if they do so quickly,” Lewellen said.  Among Lewellen’s solutions are the use of real-time security and monitoring features that kick in as soon as an exploit is detected. This may mean deploying smart contracts that block the transfer of funds over a bridge, or even lock the funds on the bridge itself, could they be flagged as a breach.  Such an approach may be more beneficial compared to relying on audits, a newly formed crypto industry where developers try to attack protocols to locate flaws apart from proof-reading one’s code.  “Pre-launch audits of the code underpinning liquidity pools have proved to be insufficient in anticipating the likelihood of their falling prey to security failures,” Lewellen said. “For developers to maintain the security of their protocols, real-time security practices need to be sustained after launch to keep them alert to how their protocols are operating under real-world usage.”  Such steps would still not keep all attackers at bay, Lewellen warns. “Many attackers will use both technical exploits and malicious trading practices to seize funds in unexpected ways,” he said.  As of the time of this writing, there’s still over $6 billion locked on blockchain bridges, data from DeFiLlama shows.

The ETF has a better balanced portfolio since our latest coverage. Valuation metrics indicate that many of BLOK's constituents are oversold. Although a technology sector drawdown has halted dividend distributions, the ETF has a rich history of lucrative shareholder compensation. This ETF is an extremely high-risk security and should preferably only be traded by investors that understand the asset's embedded risks. This analysis covers the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF ( BLOK ), otherwise known as ""BLOK"". I thought it would be productive to discuss BLOK in light of its more than 10% year-to-date surge. The Nasdaq has spiked by approximately 4% since the turn of the year, which has provided systemic support to assets such as BLOK as it's a high-beta play on the index. I'm not fully sold on a tech stock rally during 2023. However, I think BLOK provides a good option if you're bullish on the technology sector; here's why. Amplify ETFs Portfolio Update BLOK operates an actively managed portfolio, meaning its constituents will likely be a whole lot different in a few months' time than they are now. Nevertheless, the ETF's portfolio reveals that it has shifted its weight towards larger capitalization stocks with more robust income statements. I assume Amplify's management has done this to combat the risk-off market sentiment while remaining committed to its thematic mandate. Amplify ETFs Let's run through a few of the constituents' key metrics to elaborate on my ""more robust income statement' claim. I want to place emphasis on EBITDA margins as it presents a helpful indicator of tech company profitability by phasing out subjective amortization elements. In addition, I want to focus on ROE (return on equity) as a means of measuring investors' residual value. As visible in the diagram below, Amplify hosts numerous stocks with tremendously sound income statements, allowing it to throw some defense on the field until the financial markets become more high-beta conducive. Stocks EBITDA Margin ROE IBM ( IBM ) 19.84% 6.51% Accenture ( ACN ) 16.96% 32.55% MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) 5.06% -10x CME Group ( CME ) 66.80% 9.48% Silvergate Capital ( SI ) 46.45% (net income) 9.95% Source: Seeking Alpha Despite its recent shift toward 'defensive tech', the ETF still holds numerous VC-Esque assets in its portfolio as it is more than 40% exposed to small-cap securities, many of which are secured by blockchain mining companies. I mention the latter because of the negative sentiment surrounding the industry, with some analysts calling it a ""crash"" . Portfolio Composition (Amplify ETFs) Whether you think the ETF's innovation-linked exposure is risky is down to your personal risk appetite. I believe the vehicle is an excellent intermediary between risk-tolerant investors and embryonic stage investment opportunities. However, I urge you all to keep in mind that the ETF possesses significant beta risk, which will almost certainly add risk to your general investment portfolio. Data by YCharts BLOK's Managerial Performance I was surprised to see that BLOK possesses a few promising risk-return metrics. The fund's active return/risk shouldn't be considered as it is unconstrained. However, positive return skewness and respectable Sharpe and Sortino ratios suggest BLOK's managerial skill is better than most might think. It is necessary to remember that the blockchain space plummeted during 2022's bear market due to its cyclical characteristics. However, if a market recovery unfolds, the opposite might occur, which would significantly improve the fund's portfolio management metrics. Regression since inception - double click on the image to enlarge (Author in PortfolioVisualizer) Valuation and Dividends Relative valuation doesn't carry much weight when it comes to growth stocks. However, it does contextualize whether an asset has been oversold or not. In my opinion, a portfolio price-to-book ratio of only 1.54x and a price-to-earnings ratio of merely 10.58x suggests various of the ETF's holdings are oversold. PortfolioVisualizer Although Amplify's BLOK didn't distribute any compensation in 2022, the vehicle has a history of lucrative dividend yields. However, the tech sector's (and blockchain in particular) recent retracement could delay dividend distributions until we experience a significant global macroeconomic recovery. Seeking Alpha Concluding Thoughts BLOK provides a lucrative high-beta opportunity to investors that are bullish on a tech sector recovery. Given the circumstances, the ETF is extremely well managed, and its valuation metrics suggest that many of its constituents might be oversold. As revealed by its daily standard deviations and losses in 2022, this ETF is a high-risk asset.

Along with the deposits, Silvergate will almost certainly lose its network effect, the main competitive advantage. One of the beneficiaries of this storm could be Signature Bank, which also provides payment infrastructure for the crypto market. Signature's potential losses from crypto are limited, which can attract large clients looking for a haven for their capital. Investment Thesis The recent collapse of Silvergate Capital ( SI ) stock, fueled by catastrophic deposit outflows and gigantic losses, has prompted some investors to buy the dip, in line with the old adage that “you should buy when there’s blood in the streets.” But you shouldn't. In less than three months, the bank lost $8.1 billion in deposits, of which only $150 million came from clients who filed for bankruptcy. Customers take money out of fear that the bank will go under. This could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. One of the key competitive advantages of the SEN platform was the network effect. However, Silvergate may lose it as customers are forced to look for an alternative. In October, one of the largest crypto exchanges, a former client of SEN, switched to Signet from Signature Bank ( SBNY ). Signature's potential losses from crypto are limited, which attracts not only investors but also large clients looking for a haven for their capital. Through a conservative approach to financial management, Signature Bank can become an example of Nassim Taleb's antifragility, and emerge from the crisis as the market leader in infrastructure for crypto companies. Don’t Buy the Dip Through the Silvergate Exchange Network [SEN] platform, the company provides a payment infrastructure for crypto clients that brings together the largest players in the industry and allows them to conduct transactions between themselves 24/7. Like traditional banks, Silvergate earns mainly on the spread between the cost of attracting earning assets (the cost of deposits) and their profitability (the interest on loans issued). Silvergate deposits are interest-free as they are the money of crypto clients on the SEN platform. On January 5, Silvergate Capital lost 48% of its market value after the crypto bank reported a catastrophic drop in deposits and giant losses. A series of challenges that the crypto industry has faced over the past year has forced customers to withdraw their money from the platform, causing deposits from digital asset customers to drop from $11.9 billion on September 30 to $3.8 billion. The bank sold $5.2 billion of debt securities to maintain balance sheet liquidity, resulting in a loss of $718 million, more than double its net income over the past seven years, including previous expectations for 2022. On September 30, digital deposits accounted for 89% of all Silvergate deposits. Assuming that the balance of other deposits remained unchanged, then the bank's total deposits collapsed by about 61% in less than a quarter, which is comparable to outflows during the Great Depression. Notably, only ~$150 million came from clients who filed for bankruptcy. This tells us about a deep crisis of confidence in Silvergate. Customers withdraw money not because they need cash, but because they fear the bank will go under. This could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. One of SEN's key competitive advantages was its network effect. Early market entry allowed Silvergate to connect crypto market leaders to the platform. Their presence encouraged other players to join SEN as well. Silvergate management is optimistic that although customers have withdrawn their money, they remain on the platform: ""That said, we didn't have any clients that said that they were exiting the space altogether. Perhaps there will be some that do, but we didn't receive that feedback. And our clients were generally supportive of Silvergate despite the fact that they pulled their deposits. And just really given the overall circumstances, decided to take that action. And -- but seemed to be committed to the space and willing to come back when market conditions are right."" – Ben Reynolds, Chief Strategy Officer . So, management expects that clients will return the money when (read IF) a new rally begins in the crypto market. The problem is that large companies are not individual investors. They cannot sit back on cash and wait for the market to turn around. Crypto exchanges, hedge funds, and mining firms have to perform regular operations to serve their customers, and they need infrastructure. If at the time of prosperity, the switching costs for Silvergate customers were high, now they will certainly pay it to continue their operations. When (read IF again) the crypto market reverses, the switching costs will rise again, but they will need to be paid to return to SEN. Alternative for Investors Surely, the remaining customers are already wondering whether they should save their money on the SEN, or is it better to switch to Signet from Signature Bank. Unlike Silvergate, Signature remains a classic bank with a strong loan portfolio and a low Loans-to-Deposits ratio. However, most importantly, digital deposits account for only 22.9% of all bank deposits. Even if all crypto clients leave Signet, the Loans-to-Deposits ratio will be 93.1%, which is still significantly lower than during 2019, when the indicator was at the level of 96.4-101.6%. The Signature loan portfolio is of high quality. The bank has a lower ratio of total net write-offs to average loans than that of the top 50 US banks. With a total loan portfolio value of $73.8 billion, only $100 million comes from crypto-backed loans. While Silvergate's SEN Leverage accounts for 64% of total loans held-for-investment. The conservative approach to lending does not make Signature less innovative. Both companies earn interest, but Silvergate accepts volatile bitcoin as collateral, while Signature accepts real estate and equipment. Thus, Signature’s potential losses from crypto are highly limited, which can attract not only investors but also large clients looking for a haven for their capital. Along with the deposits, Silvergate will almost certainly lose its network effect, the main competitive advantage, and Signet will become a potential beneficiary. In October, Coinbase ( COIN ) announced that it would settle with its institutional clients through Signet. This event is likely directly related to Silvergate's difficulties since COIN was previously a participant of SEN . You can learn more about Signature Bank in our recent research . Conclusion The significant outflow of Silvergate deposits, that the company has experienced, is indicative of a significant crisis of confidence. One of the beneficiaries of this storm could be Signature Bank, which also provides payment infrastructure for the crypto market. Signature's potential losses from crypto are highly limited, which can attract not only investors but also large clients looking for a haven for their capital.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4569646-silvergate-capital-dont-buy-dip?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7471623.jpeg

We highlight the fund's strategy to focus on long-term themes and discuss the breakdown of its portfolio composition. BLOK is a good option for investors that are cautiously bullish on the crypto sector while including exposure to broader tech names. The Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF ( BLOK ) invests in companies involved in blockchain technologies and related applications. While the concept of peer-to-peer distributed ledgers as a method of recording transactions was originally connected to cryptocurrencies, the attraction is the growing number of use cases across all sectors that go beyond the volatility in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and other digital assets. Still, the fund's performance has been nearly a disaster, caught up in the broader market selloff last year and that particular crypto exposure from key underlying holdings. BLOK is off more than 75% from its all-time high in 2021, during a period defined by its speculative frenzy. What we find is that BLOK's strategy has quietly shifted away from being a pure play on ""crypto"", while taking a broader definition of blockchain companies to include more global tech leaders. We see BLOK entering 2023 as a more diversified fund that is still positioned to capture the high-level trends in blockchain, albeit with a more balanced risk profile. The fund has rallied off its lows and we see several reasons the recent momentum can continue. What is the BLOK ETF? A key point about BLOK is that the fund is actively managed meaning it does not follow a particular index, with holdings at the discretion of the portfolio management team. According to the fund sponsor Amplify ETFs, the object is to invest at least 80% of its net assets in stocks of companies ""actively involved in the development and utilization of blockchain technologies"". From the fund prospectus, the selected companies largely fall into one of three categories: Actively engaging in the research and development, testing, and/or implementation of transformational data-sharing technology. Profiting from the demand for transformational data-sharing applications such as transaction data, cryptocurrency, and supply chain data. Partnering with and/or directly investing in companies that are actively engaged in the development and/or use of transformational data-sharing technology. The takeaway for us is that these criteria have some room for interpretation allowing the strategy to go in various directions. That's the setup today with the top 10 holdings in BLOK including global consulting firm Accenture plc ( ACN ), International Business Machines Corp ( IBM ), and CME Group Inc ( CME ). These large-cap industry leaders have a peripheral connection to ""the blockchain"" but are hardly the first names that come to mind when thinking about crypto. By our calculation, approximately 55% of the 48 current holdings are non-pure-play crypto stocks. The justification with ACN is likely the company's push to offer blockchain consulting services, although this is likely a small part of its current business. With IBM, it makes sense that its data center solutions represent the critical infrastructure side of digital assets that utilize cloud networks. That's also the case with Japan-based GMO internet group ( OTCPK:GMOYF ) focusing on a variety of internet infrastructure services. The theme continues with other smaller holdings in stocks like Oracle Corp ( ORCL ), Sysco Corp ( SYY ), Intel Inc ( INTC ), and Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ). Visa Inc ( V ) and Mastercard Inc ( MA ) are the traditional payments leaders but have acknowledged the importance of new technologies. Even Walmart Inc ( WMT ) finds its spot with its potential utilization of blockchain for its e-commerce supply chains. source: Amplify (annotation by author) To be clear, there are still plenty of pure-play crypto names including MicroStrategy Inc ( MSTR ) where the company's $2.2 billion market cap is comprised almost entirely of its balance-sheet Bitcoin holdings. BLOK holds Coinbase Global Inc ( COIN ), recognized as a major crypto exchange, and a survivor compared to other high-profile bankruptcies in the sector. Moving along, Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd ( OTCPK:BRPHF ) and Silvergate Capital ( SI ), along with several smaller positions in Bitcoin miners like Riot Platforms Inc ( RIOT ), Marathon Digital Holdings Inc ( MARA ), Bitfarms Ltd ( BITF ) are all directly tied to the value of digital assets. The reason we're focusing on this dynamic is that BLOK today looks a lot different from when it was essentially ""all-in"" on crypto. The sense is that this group has sort of taken a back seat compared to its more high-profile position at peak of the crypto boom. Over the past year, it's clear the crypto names have significantly underperformed the companies with less direct involvement in blockchain technologies. Data by YCharts For context, here is a screengrab of what the BLOK portfolio looked like at the end of Q1 2021 where nine of the top 10 holdings were direct digital asset names. Again, it appears the strategy has attempted to hedge itself against the more speculative side of the blockchain theme into the relative safety of large-cap segment leaders. source: Amplify What's Next for BLOK? Putting it all together, we think BLOK can work for investors that want exposure to crypto and blockchain technologies with a cautiously bullish approach. This is in contrast to a few alternative blockchain and crypto ETFs that may be more aggressive and have a higher risk in terms of their portfolio positioning. We can bring up Global X Blockchain ETF ( BKCH ), VanEck Vectors Digital Transformation ETF ( DAPP ), and Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF ( BITQ ) where many of the same stocks are covered, but the crypto pure plays have larger roles in the portfolio. For us, we're bullish on stocks and see value in beaten-down tech names which can benefit from a shifting macro environment where inflationary pressures ease, opening the door for Central Bank's to ease off aggressively hawkish rate hiking policies. By this measure, the more diversified global stocks within BLOK in names like IBM, CME, PYPL, V, and MA should benefit from that market tailwind while the high-beta crypto stocks add to the upside potential. On this point, the biggest risk in BLOK still comes down to the future of digital assets and Bitcoin considering the cumulatively material direct exposure to underlying portfolio holdings. A scenario where BTC crash under its recent cycle low or regulatory changes like a "" Crypto ban "" have been discussed by various governments. Any steps to limit the adoption or proliferation of digital assets and blockchain technologies would undermine the long-term bullish case. From a technical perspective, it's encouraging to see BLOK rally in recent weeks, well off its lows. A breakout above $17.00 would drive a new wave of momentum which is our base case going forward.

Related Reading: Altcoin Volume Dominance At Highest Since Jan 2021, Trouble For Bitcoin? Ethereum Shark Addresses Have Grown By 3,000 In the Last Two Months As per data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the current number of shark addresses in the market is the highest since February 2021. The relevant indicator here is the “ETH Supply Distribution,” which tells us which coin groups have how many wallets. These coin groups are ranges that define the number of coins the addresses currently hold in a particular group. For example, the 1-10 coins cohort includes all wallets holding at least one and at most 10 ETH. The Supply Distribution metric for this group would then track the total number of addresses falling inside this range. In the context of the current topic, the coin group of interest is the 100-10,000 coins cohort (which is made up of two separate groups, 100-1,000 coins, and 1,000-10,000 coins; they have just been merged). Now, here is a chart that shows the Supply Distribution data for this Ethereum coin group: It looks like the value of this metric has observed some uptrend in recent weeks | Source: Santiment on Twitter This coin group’s lower and upper bounds convert to around $140,000 and $14 million. The Ethereum investors who hold amounts in this range are called the sharks, and although they aren’t as crucial as the whales, movements from these holders can still have significant implications on the market. As shown in the above graph, the Ethereum sharks were taking profits during September and October last year as their total number of addresses declined to a low. However, over the past few months, accumulation has rapidly taken place in the market as 3,000 new shark addresses have been created on the network. ETH has been rallying in recent days as these sharks have been accumulating, and for now, these investors aren’t showing any signs of stopping either. The total number of addresses belonging to this cohort is 48,556, the highest level the indicator has seen since February 2021, almost two years ago. If these sharks budge here and take some profits while the prices are high, the rally might lose steam and end. However, if these investors keep this accumulation up instead, it would be a bullish sign for Ethereum, and the rally may continue.
