29105445,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611978,1717803052,Bitcoin’s Stubborn Stand Below $100K: What’s Holding It Back?,"Bitcoin continues to be the market leader. However, despite significant developments, such as the introduction of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), the anticipated price surge to $100,000 remains ‘unrealized.’ Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, commented on this and took to Elon Musk’s social media platform X to explain the hurdles preventing Bitcoin from achieving this milestone. Related Reading: Is $100K Bitcoin Inevitable? This Expert Say ‘Yes’—Find Out When Examining Bitcoin’s Stagnation Below $100k According to Edwards, one of the primary factors is the sale of Bitcoin by long-term holders. His analysis shows a decline in wallets holding Bitcoin for over two years, from an all-time high of 57% in December 2023 to 54%. Although this 3% drop might seem minor, it represents about 630,000 BTC—far exceeding the quantity purchased by US Bitcoin ETFs since January. This sell-off by long-standing investors is exerting downward pressure on the price. Edwards also pointed out that the market has yet to fully feel the impact of Bitcoin’s halving event in April, which reduced the daily issuance of Bitcoin by 50%. We haven’t seen the impacts of the Halving yet. With the daily Bitcoin issuance dropping by 50% in April, we will likely see the delta between ETF consumption and Bitcoin mined widen a lot over the next year. It also takes full quarters for institutions to review, sign-off and… pic.twitter.com/bAxfFzv6L8 — Charles Edwards (@caprioleio) June 7, 2024 He believes that the gap between the amount of Bitcoin purchased by spot ETFs and the reduced output from mining will widen significantly, underscoring the need for financial institutions to adjust their strategies and continue leading in Bitcoin acquisitions. Meanwhile, Edwards identified three key factors that he believes are essential for a sharp rise in Bitcoin’s price: increased daily ETF purchases, reduced selling by long-term holders, and an expansion in U.S. market liquidity. BTC Price Slow Amid Record ETF Inflows Bitcoin trades at $71,926, showing modest movements as it struggles to mark any price increase over the past 24 hours, despite a 4.9% rise in the last 7 days. While Charles Edwards has detailed reasons behind Bitcoin not reaching the $100,000 milestone, other experts are analyzing why substantial inflows into spot BTC ETFs have not translated into a corresponding price surge. Experts believe that various factors muffle ETFs’ influence on Bitcoin’s price. Seasoned crypto trader Christopher Inks points out that a complex interplay of spot trading, futures, options, and ETFs influences the Bitcoin market. Inks stresses that an exclusive focus on ETF activities does not provide a complete view of the market dynamics. Responding to a user query on X about the stagnant price despite ETF purchases, Inks remarked, “You do realize the market is made up of spot, futures, ETFs, and options, right? Price at any point in time is a product of all of these, not just one of them..” Further discussions among financial experts illuminate the multifaceted nature of the BTC market. Analyst Eric Balchunas suggests that the lack of price movement despite ETF purchases might be due to existing Bitcoin holders selling their holdings, which balances out the buying pressure from ETFs. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, the call is coming from inside the house holmes. This is not ETFs doing, obv bc they buying like crazy lately, it’s bitcoin holders selling or leveraged flushers or whatever.

Related Reading: Buckle Up: Bitcoin’s Ride to $74K Could Start Any Minute – Here’s Why Jimie added that the majority is controlled by large holders (“whales”), whose trading activities could overpower the influence of ETF buying.

Token Surges 300% And Nears $2 Billion Market Cap,"As the overall sentiment in the crypto market veers towards bullishness, leading cryptos have regained their previously lost levels and ignited further interest in meme coins. Brett (BRETT) has emerged as the standout performer, experiencing a 400% gain in the past 30 days alone. Having launched just three months ago, BRETT now boasts a market cap of $1.7 billion, positioning itself as the top gainer in the top 100 spot of the market. The Largest Meme Coin On The Base Network BRETT is a meme coin built on the Base network, with its mascot inspired by a character in Matt Furie’s Boys’ Club comic. Since its launch in February 2024, BRETT has become the largest meme coin on the Base network in terms of market cap, earning the title of “PEPE’s best friend on BASE.” Notably, BRETT stands out due to its renounced contract and absence of a minting function, which places the token’s trajectory fully in the hands of its community. The creator of BRETT cannot generate additional tokens or manipulate the contract, relying instead on the vibrant and dedicated community to drive its development. Related Reading: Bitcoin On The Verge As Global Liquidity Nears New $100 Million ATH With a fixed total supply of 10 billion tokens, BRETT’s scarcity and potential future value are influenced by the limited creation of new tokens. The coin follows a fair launch model, ensuring equal opportunities for all participants. BRETT does not impose transaction taxes, which can incentivize trading activity but may impact long-term value. Regarding distribution, 85% of the tokens are allocated to the Liquidity Provider (locked), 10% to the Treasury, and 5% to the Centralized exchange wallet. BRETT Surges 21,000% From All-Time Low As of now, BRETT is trading at $0.1794. It maintains its position as the top meme coin on the BASE network while also being the market’s best performer, experiencing a 33% surge in the last 24 hours. CoinGecko data reveals a staggering 21,000% increase from its all-time low, highlighting the immense surge in interest the token has garnered in recent months. Furthermore, BRETT’s trading volume has increased significantly, rising by 62% in the past few days to reach $219 million. Notably, BRETT is the first meme coin on the Base network to surpass a $1 billion market cap. Related Reading: Injective (INJ) Price Set To Skyrocket 33% On Classic Bullish Signal: Crypto Analyst While BRETT’s current uptrend is notable, it remains to be seen whether the token can sustain its momentum and climb to higher positions in the market. If so, it could potentially surpass other meme coins like Bonk Inu (BONK) in terms of market cap, with the difference between the two being a mere $200 million. At its all-time high (ATH), BRETT reached $0.1887, which might serve as a near-term resistance level for the token, as it has struggled to surpass this mark in the past two days.

A trend that resurged at the end of May quickly became one of the biggest narratives around the crypto community. Related Reading: GMX Soars 20% Amid Crypto Whale Frenzy, Is It Back In ‘Turbo Mode’? The industry has seen controversies, rug pulls, and Vitalik Buterin’s thoughts on the celebrity token frenzy. In the phenomenon’s most recent development, WWE wrestler Hulk Hogan beefed with Australian rapper Iggy Azalea. Celebrity Memecoins A Week Later Despite the trend starting around May 20 with influencer tokens, celebrity tokens didn’t gain mainstream traction until reality TV star and Olympian Caitlyn Jenner launched her JENNER memecoin. Alongside Jenner, rapper Rich the Kid joined the crypto community with RICH. However, both tokens were surrounded by controversy after it was revealed that alleged serial scammer Sahil Arora was involved in the launch. Several other artists and personalities joined the crypto space to launch their memecoins, including Lil Pump, Davido, Trippie Red, and MoneyBagg Yo. Some of these launches appear to be linked to Arora’s scams. A week later, most celebrity memecoins saw a significant price decline or ended up as a rug pull scam. JENNER, which kickstarted the celebrity mania, is currently 81% down from its all-time high (ATH) registered on May 27. The Olympian’s token, described as “the goddess of Solana,” went from trading around $0.04273 to $0.009072. This significant decrease has also cut its market capitalization from its $30 million peak to $7.5 million. Hulk Hogan Wrestles MOTHER And Dumps His Fans On Thursday, former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan took X to announce the launch of his Hulkmania (HULK) token. The memecoin skyrocketed 500% within two hours and quickly reached a market cap of $17 million. The launch turned sour when investors found Hogan had sold his HULK bag and deleted his posts mentioning the token. In minutes, the token’s market cap plummeted to $2 million. During the hours that Hogan’s X account promoted the token, the retired wrestler seemingly targeted Azalea and MOTHER. In an X post, Hogan replied to Azalea, saying, “You suck at pumping. $HULK has the real milk.” Additionally, he shared two now-deleted Instagram posts beefing with the Australian rapper. In one of them, Hogan Azalea’s profile picture and captioned it, “Sahil does it best.” Before deleting all his HULK-related posts, Hogan shared an Instagram story claiming that he had been hacked. According to the post, none of the publications came from him and soon would be removed. Later, his X account was wiped completely, and Instagram comments were limited. The crypto community grew concerned as the mention of Arora’s name suggested his involvement in the scam. However, it remains unclear whether Hogan’s website, Instagram, and X account were all hacked or if the retired wrestler’s team was involved. Vitalik Buterin Vs Koala Vitalik? Earlier this week, Ethereum’s founder, Vitalik Buterin, criticized the ongoing celebrity token phenomenon. On X, Buterin stated he is “quite unhappy” with the crypto space’s celebrity experimentation. Buterin explained his concern regarding the launch of tokens with no purpose other than being a get-rich-quick scheme. Additionally, he suggested some features that celebrity memecoins should have for him “to be more willing to respect it.” The list included a “public-good goal that it’s serving.” To his criticism, Azalea responded by claiming that Buterin “was just hangry.” Moreover, she seemingly named a Koala after Ethereum’s founder. The rapper uploaded a video announcing the donations saved another Koala. Its name? Koala Vitalik. Azalea launched a “MOTHER fund” to help save Koalas infected with chlamydia. For the past week, the rapper has received donations in memecoins and several cryptocurrencies for the Koala cause.

The analyst also revealed how high the crypto token could rise once it makes this move to the upside. Inverted Hammer Forms On The Chart Egrag highlighted an Inverted hammer that had formed on XRP’s chart while noting how bullish this was for the crypto token. He claimed that last month’s candle formation showed a 75% Inverted Hammer at the bottom, which is “super bullish” for XRP. Egrag believes this is an “amazing sign” that the altcoin could rise to $0.75 soon enough. He added that July will be a “month of fireworks” for XRP. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Surge To $71,000 Sends All Long-Term Holders Into Profit, What About Short-Term Holders? XRP’s possible rise to $0.75 is significant, as Egrag had previously highlighted that price level as a “critical breakout point” for XRP. Back then, he mentioned that XRP was “poised” to achieve this breakout in the coming weeks. He suggested an XRP breakout above that price level would send it to $1.5, and the crypto token could enjoy a further upward trend to $7.5. Crypto analyst CasiTrades also recently provided a bullish narrative for the altcoin. She stated that the crypto token is maintaining its bullish momentum and bouncing off the 0.382 retracement level. The analyst added that XRP has finally flipped a trendline that had acted as resistance for months to support. Meanwhile, CasiTrades highlighted $0.54 as a price level to keep an eye on, stating that XRP could encounter resistance at that level. She suggested that the coin could enjoy a parabolic move if it breaks out above that price level, remarking that it is a “crucial level to watch for a potential breakthrough.”CasiTrades previously raised the possibility of the altcoin rising to as high as $80 when it breaks out from a consolidation triangle. XRP Is On The Brink Of A Parabolic Rally Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto recently suggested that XRP was on the brink of a parabolic rally. He stated in an X post that the token is currently at the level it was in 2017 and 2020, which triggered a “massive rally” for the crypto token on both occasions. In 2017, the altcoin enjoyed a price gain of 61,000% in 280 days. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Open Interest Returns To February 2024 Levels, What Happened Last Time?

42417955,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc9Dp,1717788613,"Craig Wright Should Pay Plaintiffs' Legal Bill After Found Posing as Satoshi, COPA Says","The Crypto Open Patent Alliance is demanding that Craig Wright pay 85% of its legal costs.  COPA took Wright to court in February to find out if he was Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin.  The presiding judge of the case, James Mellor, ruled that Wright was not Nakamoto in March.  The Crypto Open Patent Alliance's (COPA) legal representatives on Friday asked Judge James Mellor to grant that Craig Wright pay 85% of the costs the group incurred in the legal proceedings.  COPA took Wright to a U.K. court in February to find out, once and for all, if he was the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, after Wright had taken members of the crypto community to court over the years under the premise that he was Nakamoto. The English court ruled in COPA's favor in March that Wright was not the creator of bitcoin and that he did not author the bitcoin whitepaper.  Jonathan Hough, one of COPA's legal representatives, asked that Wright be given a civil restraint order to stop him from pursuing any other legal court cases, because ""he has poured out threats."" COPA also offered to submit a list of online posts that Wright should take down.  Hough said that this case should also be put forward for criminal proceedings following the courts judgement that Wright committed multiple forgeries during the trial. The Bitcoin developers who joined this case also asked that Wright pay for 85.2% of their costs.  Unless Wright was prevented from doing so, he would continue to ""propagate lies,"" Hough argued.  “There is a powerful public interest in them [lies] being brought to an end now,” Hough said, pointing to the litigation that spanned more than five years that Wright had brought against COPA members such as Coinbase Inc. (COIN) and Kraken, among others.  Read more: What Happens Next in COPA vs Craig Wright Trial is Down to the Judge  Hitting back  Wright's defense argued that not clarifying the perimeters in which Wright can say he is Nakamoto could infringe on his human rights.  “What if Dr. Wright sent an email to a medical professional asserting he was Satoshi – that’s a publication of a statement,” Craig Orr, Wright's lawyer said, adding that the suggestion that Wright take down all his posts was ""parasitic."" His defense also asked that the amount Wright pays be brought down to 70% of the costs COPA incurred.  The room was filled with people from the legal world that sought to see the end of this trial. They were able to hear Hough playing back Wright's own words in an Oxford Union video from 2019.  “Yes, there is altered pages,” Wright said in the video that bellowed across the court room.  “So, I’m going to court on this; I don’t need to face trolls in rooms. You know what happens when you lie in the court; you know what happens – for court perjury – you get 20 years. That’s how real things work in the real world outside of the crypto Twitter-storm world. In the real world, people have evidence and rules.""  The judge was inundated by lawyers jumping in to defend clients like Coinbase, who offered new thoughts and didn't agree fully with some of the cost figures that were presented.  Mellor, whose expression shifted from certain to ever-more-pensive as the trial went on, decided at the end of it he could not give a judgement at that moment, but he said he'll give a decision on costs first before making a decision on what kind of injunctive relief the court would seek. Injunctive relief is a measure from the court that would seek to prevent defendants from doing something.  The court didn't immediately provide information to CoinDesk seeking more information in the exact timing of the judgement.

42417956,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc9Aj,1717788410,"New York AG Pushes Back Against DCG, Silbert’s Motion to Dismiss Fraud Case","New York Attorney General Letitia James is not backing down from her civil lawsuit against Digital Currency Group, its founder and CEO Barry Silbert, and Soichiro “Michael” Moro, the former CEO of DCG’s wholly-owned crypto trading arm, Genesis.  On Tuesday, James’ office filed a motion in opposition to DCG’s, Silbert’s and Moro’s motions to dismiss the case filed in March.  Along with crypto exchange Gemini, James’ office has accused Genesis, DCG, Silbert and Moro of defrauding investors by working together to cover up a gaping $1 billion hole in Genesis’ balance sheet caused by the wipe-out of Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC). At the time of its implosion, 3AC was Genesis’ second-largest borrower.  According to James’ October suit, Genesis and DCG made “false assurances” on Twitter that DCG had absorbed Genesis’ losses, designed to put investors at ease and prevent them from calling in their open loans. But instead of actually covering Genesis’ losses, DCG allegedly just wrote its subsidiary firm a promissory note – essentially an IOU meant to create the appearance of liquidity – pledging to pay Genesis $1.1 billion over ten years at 1% interest.  DCG, James’ suit alleges, “never made a single payment under the Note.” In November 2022, Genesis halted withdrawals and declared bankruptcy two months later.  DCG and Silbert have denied that the promissory note was a sham. In their motions to dismiss, lawyers for DCG and Silbert claimed that the note was fully vetted and binding, adding that, in addition to the note, DCG transferred hundreds of millions of dollars and assets into Genesis to fill the hole in its balance sheet. The tweets reassuring investors of Genesis’ “strong” balance sheet, they argued, were simply “corporate puffery” – not lies.  James’ latest motion argues that the tweets weren’t simple puffery: they were “misrepresentation of existing facts” made to “mislead the investing public” – a violation of New York’s strict anti-fraud law, the Martin Act.  Read more: Digital Currency Group Files for Dismissal of New York Attorney General’s Lawsuit  Midnight strategy meeting  In a transcript of a late-night June 15, 2022 Microsoft Teams chat attached to James’ motion, Silbert, Moro and various high-level Genesis executives strategized about how to respond to investors in the wake of 3AC’s collapse.  “I know I sound like a conspiracy theorist but I’m very concerned about any leakage of our overall net position,” then-Managing Director Matthew Ballensweig, wrote in the 16-person chat.  “I agree with the caution,” Moro responded.  Later that night, after some members of the team had a call to discuss the 3AC situation, another employee, Genesis’ managing head of trading Michael Paleokrassas, wrote to say:  “Not sure anyone is awake, but starting to see a steady flow of calls starting.”  The next morning, another employee said, “We’ve been defen[d]ing the castle all night and day on [the] phone with depositors, prospects, etc.”  Silbert chimed in, saying: “Is there anything we/DCG can do to further install confidence in genesis…the word on the street is that genesis is the 'blue chip' in this mess. We need to continue to perpetuate that of course.”  James’ suit alleges that these conversations were part of a “concerted misinformation campaign to conceal Genesis’ financial weakness to induce investors to continue supplying cryptocurrency to Genesis”  A representative for DCG declined to comment on the NYAG's latest motion, stating the company's stance on the matter ""remains unchanged"" from the position illustrated in DCG and Silbert's motions to dismiss, and calling the suit ""meritless.""  “Circle of Trust”  The newly-released Microsoft Teams chats expand on previous examples of Silbert, Moro and other employees strategizing internally to prevent word of Genesis’ problems from leaking to investors, while publicly tweeting that everything was fine, James' lawsuit alleged.  In Silbert’s own motion to dismiss, his lawyers attached emails and instant messaging threads showing his response to the fallout from 3AC’s collapse. In one, Silbert said “we are all focused on making sure that the trust and confidence in Genesis remains high because we can’t risk money leaving Genesis and depleting [DCG’s] liquidity.”  He added that “even though [DCG’s] liquidity is super super strong right now” the hole in Genesis’ balance sheet is “super confidential/sensitive stuff, so please don’t share with anybody” outside of “the circle of trust.”  Three days after that, on June 24, 2022, Silbert told colleagues: “We just can’t allow people inside or outside [to] question Genesis’ solvency.”  Martin Act Violations?  James’ motion of opposition re-asserts her office’s claim that “each of the DCG defendants” – meaning DCG, Silbert and Moro – were well aware of the allegedly fraudulent practices being committed to make Genesis look solvent, a violation of New York’s strict anti-fraud law, the Martin Act.  “The DCG Defendants were actively involved in Genesis’ day-to-day affairs…including attending daily meetings to discuss Genesis’ communications with its investors,” the motion alleges.  The Martin Act broadly prohibits any fraudulent business activities relating to the purchase, exchange, promotion, advertisement or sale of any securities or commodities.  The NYAG's office has pursued cases against a number of crypto companies and entities under this law, including its 2019 inquiry into Tether and Bitfinex.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is In The Extreme Greed Territory Right Now The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator created by Alternative that keeps track of the average sentiment present among the traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency market. The index represents this sentiment as a number between zero and 100. To calculate the score, the metric takes into account five factors: volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends. Related Reading: Shiba Inu, Cardano Seeing Explosive Whale Activity, Santiment Reveals When the Fear & Greed Index has a value greater than 54, the investors are greedy. On the other hand, values under 46 imply that the market is fearful currently. The region between these two cutoffs signifies the territory of a neutral mentality. In addition to these three core sentiments, the index has two special zones: “extreme greed” and “extreme fear.” The former occurs when the metric surpasses 75, while the latter occurs at levels under 25. Now, here is what the sentiment in the Bitcoin market looks like right now based on the Fear & Greed Index: As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has a value of 77 at the moment, which suggests that investors as a whole feel extreme greed. The current value means, however, that the market is only just inside this territory. Earlier, the indicator had a lower value, but the latest price surge beyond the $71,000 level has meant that investors have openly jumped on the bull bandwagon. Below is a chart showing how the sector’s sentiment has changed over the past year. The graph shows that the latest values of the Fear & Greed Index are the highest that the cryptocurrency has witnessed since the first half of April. Between then and now, the only other time the indicator stepped inside the extreme greed zone was during a stretch in May. During this phase, 76 was the highest the metric could go, which is right at the region’s boundary. Historically, the price of Bitcoin has tended to go against the majority’s expectations, and the stronger this expectation has become, the more likely it is that such a contrary move will occur. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surges Past $71,000, But TD Sequential Says ‘Sell’ Since the extreme sentiment zones are where the market turns the most lopsided, reversals are probable. Naturally, extreme fear is where bottoms happen, while extreme greed can lead to tops. As such, the latest breach into the extreme greed territory could perhaps be bad news for the recovery rally. It should be noted, though, that the current level of the indicator may still not be too high compared to past bull run levels. For example, the rally to the new all-time high price in March saw the indicator peak at 90. BTC Price So far in its recovery run, Bitcoin has risen towards the $71,500 level.

42417959,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc9Ft,1717786530,Big Friday Crypto Selloff Pulls Bitcoin Below $70K,"Challenging an all-time high earlier Friday, bitcoin has pulled back, giving up most of its weekly gains  The selloff in the rest of the cryptocurrency market was far larger as speculative fever cooled  The spot bitcoin ETFs are on their largest accumulation streak since launch, but it wasn't enough for a sustained rally in price.  What was thought to be a challenge of all-time highs for bitcoin {{BTC}} has turned into a fast retreat in U.S. trading on Friday, with the world's largest crypto barely hanging onto a week-over-week gain.  At press time, bitcoin was changing hands at $69,000, down 2.5% over the past 24 hours. That was far outperforming the broader CoinDesk 20 Index, which is lower by 5% over the same time frame.  Among CoinDesk 20 constituents, ether {{ETH}} was off 4%, Tezos {{XTX}} and EOS {{EXOS}} 10% and Solana {{SOL}} 7%.  According to data tracked by Coinglass, the selloff has led to $450 million in liquidations, the largest amount since a mid-April washout.  Challenging $72,000 earlier on Friday, bitcoin began headed lower in the U.S. morning hours after the government's employment report for May came in far stronger than expected with 272,000 jobs added. That seemingly dashed hopes for an imminent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, sending interest rates and the dollar sharply higher.  The selloff in bitcoin and crypto really picked up steam several hours later as Roaring Kitty held a hotly anticipated YouTube livesteam for the first time in several years. The trading legend perhaps disappointed those waiting for some sort of big announcement and instead said little of interest except for his hope that GameStop management will be able to transform the company into something of great value in coming years.  Already lower on the day, GME shares fell further during the broadcast, now off 40% for the session. The GME meme coin is down 50% from highs reached earlier Friday. A check of other meme coins finds dogecoin {{DOGE}} lower by 8% over the past 24 hours, shiba inu {{SHIB}} down 10%, and pepecoin {{PEPE}} off 15%.  In the meantime, bitcoin bulls might be left scratching their heads at what might be needed for a true upside breakout. The spot ETFs on Thursday completed an 18th-consecutive day of inflows, a steak not even accomplished during the frenzied price increases of February and March. Over that 18-day streak, the ETFs accumulated more than 56K bitcoins, according to HODL Capital, or nearly 7x the amount of bitcoin mined during that period.

42417951,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc98f,1717784768,Rune Christensen Explains Why He Wants to Remake Maker and Kill DAI,"Although MakerDAO’s dai {{DAI}} might be the most successful decentralized stablecoin, last year founder Rune Christensen worried the project was teetering on the edge of collapse. So he set about coming up with a rescue plan.  Christensen’s proposal, now known as Endgame, is a massive expansion of the Maker project, which would see the release of new stablecoins, new ways to generate revenue and potentially limitless new business prospects through the creation of “subDAOs.”  CoinDesk sat down with Christensen for a wide-ranging interview to get a better sense of what’s coming down the pike as Endgame begins to roll out as early as this summer. We connected on May 17, the day Maker announced the coming release of two fully decentralized stablecoins, NewStable and PureDAI, which will eventually replace DAI, which has a market cap of over $5 billion.  So it's a big news day for you guys.  You could say that.  Would you say the idea of launching a more decentralized stablecoin is a tacit acknowledgment that dai {{DAI}} should have always pursued decentralization first and foremost?  I mean, there's mainly two approaches to decentralization in DeFi. One uses decentralization as a tool and the other is using it as sort of the guiding – I wouldn't call it an ideology, but this underlying measure or the end goal itself.  What this announcement touches on is how these two things interact when using decentralization as a tool. If you're thinking about someone building a product that’s useful for end users, then making it decentralized should be done for a specific reason like resilience and the ability to offer features.  Whereas when decentralization is your guiding ideology, then the product itself is pure decentralization. It's two very different user bases and demographics, right? Our second user base is the OG Bitcoin and Ethereum types that value purity. But the vast majority of people, especially the more mature crypto gets, are more interested in useful products.  We especially see this with stablecoins. With the stablecoin trilemma it’s very hard to scale. If you have a $1 peg, you have to use real assets, which will always limit decentralization.  What are MakerDAO's core values?  When Maker started it was during a time when all these early experiments and random ideas, which were mostly pointless [were floating around]. We wanted to try to build something useful to people with this technology. We're really lucky that we had that perspective because it brought us to build a stablecoin, which, at the time, was kind of a boring idea that nobody wanted to do.  All that other stuff was cool, but you couldn’t use it unless there's something stable. It turns out that a stablecoin is actually the most powerful business model; it's basically been the product that has taken off and come out of blockchain technology that has actually impacted people. Big time, right?  Ultimately, the reason why we’re in the game now, the reason why we are basically making a lot of major changes is we're basically trying to rethink from first principles. How to really build something useful that's going to benefit people that also benefits from all the things you can do with decentralization.  Do you feel like you have a good sense of where Endgame will end up?  So the real basic concept of Endgame is really growth and resilience – that’s the overall goal. It has to be something that can grow exponentially, and as it grows it gets more and more resilient. The core idea of Endgame is to reach an end state of the system, so it doesn't have to change anymore to the extent that’s possible. That kind of taps into the original Bitcoin values, this principle that decentralization is good, resilience is good, reliability is good.  But to give people what they want, you have to be able to adapt to the market. So that's where subDAOs come into the picture; you enable the core of the system to reach this end state and become immutable. … That then allows for subDAOs to take care of all the complexity, adaptation and innovation that can attract new users.  See also: MakerDAO Founder on Regulating Stablecoins | Video  That's basically where the whole journey begins. We have to see what actually works in practice before we commit to something and follow market cues. It's hard to predict everything in advance and then just build it exactly the way it was predicted. Usually that would not result in something that is actually very useful to people. It's better to sort of figure out what people actually want and then move in that direction with it.  What do you make of the trend of DeFi brands, like Aave, for instance, expanding beyond their core category?  I mean, it's the same sort of thing that is pushing us towards Endgame at Maker. So actually I think Aave’s attempt at decentralizing social media is a bit of an outlier. I think the more classic way this is happening is – Frax was the first project to articulate this, when they were talking about how every project ends up sort of doing all the code bases models, right? So if you're DeFi, probably you'll also be doing lending, you'll be doing stablecoin, you'll be doing exchange.  Maker also is doing a DEX, lending and stablecoins. The reason why this is happening is because the real challenge all of this is not really building the actual products, it's having the governance layer in a DAO to maintain it all. So that's where all the complexity and investment goes: having the ability to make the decisions that maintain something like that. If you already have that capability for doing it with a stablecoin, then you've already paid the majority of the cost and it's very easy to add more features using the same governance rails.  And in fact, you kind of have to do that because it's so expensive and difficult to maintain the governance. With Endgame, we're taking this to the absolute extreme, because we're building this extremely advanced, extremely sophisticated governance layer that we will be reusing again and again and again with subDAOs. That’s the economies of scale – experience and data is gained from all the different subDAOs.  Do you ever feel that MakerDAO governance is over-engineered?  I believe the problem is that it's undere-ngineered.  Funny.  The problem is the reason why you can simplify governance. I mean, that's what we did originally, right? We built the technical layer, we built the protocol, and put a simple voting system on it and released it assuming that the free market would take care of it because the community will vote in their own best interests. But unfortunately, what actually happens in DAOs is politics.  So the problem is the assumption in any group setting – in any political setting, you could say – is that when somebody makes a proposal or makes an adjustment to a public system they're doing that to benefit the system, right? That's the game theory. … But the real game theory is that people will do whatever is best for them. Everybody wants to vote to give themselves money.  If you just have enough honest people, they can see that happening and then shut it down. The problem is you get this additional layer of politics where what happens is people will kind of argue over some proposal that’s supposed to be in the best interest of the whole system. They’ll say “it's so great and I'm so selfless proposing this,” but there will be an underlying motivation. It’s incredibly difficult to tell when it is genuine.  Humans are just like that, right? They will be obfuscated and they will collaborate and you'll have groups with shared interests. The point of all this is it is very, very complex – you can’t “solve” human politics. The only real answer to this is basically to put in place some hierarchy, a leader that you have faith in to decide who's being honest.  The only alternative to that is to try to build out a transparent framework that contains all of that knowledge, like all the knowledge that a CEO typically has in a company. You want to have as much public data and knowledge as possible so when you pay for a particular engineering task, you know if you were overpaying and how to quality-check it. You can’t leave all those decisions up to voters because they'll vote for, like, their own supplier that gets paid 10x market price. But you can't figure out if that's happening unless you actually have the data and these processes built.  In a sense, it’s an extremely challenging engineering effort where you have to build all these processes to be detail-oriented, because every single black box you leave anywhere in the governance system is like leaving a bug in a smart contract that a hacker can come and hack.  That's the direction we're slowly going in at Maker by building Atlas, which is sort of a big governance layer.  Do you think you would make a good politician?  No. I mean, like, I definitely have had to develop those types of skills to basically deal with the problem of doing stuff with DAOs. But I'm definitely not naturally – I'm, well, I'm not exactly a technical person in the sense that I'm not doing any of the code in Maker, but I'm definitely more technically minded. What do they call it? A shape rotator rather than a wordcel.  That's funny. You can feel free to decline to answer, but do you have any sense of why those VCs collaborated to vote against Endgame?  Well, it was not all the VCs.  I think there were three prominent ones.  I think at that point, like everyone else, they were very disappointed with what had happened with the project because it had sort of taken off – it had grown a lot and then suddenly it lost all its revenue and had crazy expenses.  And then I think from their perspective, they probably just viewed Endgame as some kind of desperate sort of fever dream, right? Like, it's already bad and now it's gonna fail fully and their tokens are going to become worthless. And then they actually sold all their MKR when they failed to vote against it. Unfortunately for them, they sold right at the bottom.  Then what happened was you had this new generation of hedge funds and VCs coming in and buying up all their MKR. These were institutions that were explicitly very, very excited about Endgame, they bought because they actually thought this was a cool idea. And I think that’s what you want – the MKR did its job because you actually want voters to be aligned.  When exactly did you start thinking that you had to do Endgame?  It really all came from the problem of the politics I just talked about, right? The budgets. I saw what was happening, and then I started extrapolating and I realized it would get so much worse – like, the project would die. That’s where the idea of subDAOs came from, a way of starting from fresh so you can set the right direction, the right momentum, with the right knowledge.  You can’t just put people in a DAO, and then have the free market steer things. You have to really give them the data, give them the frameworks, give them the tools to move in the right direction where there's interaction. And even when you do that, it will still fail sometimes. That's the other thing, it's a fresh start for communities that are specialized in particular areas so they can become more streamlined.  Spark will be a subDAO focused on DeFi innovation. And then there are other subDAOs that can be about gaming or financial inclusion by serving as a way to get yield for potential users, for instance, which is a huge crypto demographic that hasn’t really seen an advanced crypto product.  You get to make these bets on new communities that have a particular direction led by a group of people that believe in that direction. The other major thing is they're allowed to fail. It’s designed so that if a subDAO fails, it doesn't damage the whole thing, which is kind of a problem with Maker.  See also: Rune Radio  The last part is solving how to make growth really take off, because DAI was really only adopted by crypto natives. The branding was sort of quite random. So with Endgame, we’re rebranding to try to fix that. The ace up our sleeve that we have is decentralization. SubDAOs will function as an adoption funnel through tokens that offer yield to holders of the new stablecoin with new and better branding.  It's exactly the same asset – the only question is how are you getting the yield for the DAI savings rate? It’s a bit like DeFi Summer, where yield farming was essentially risk free. So it's a way to sort of get the growth, excitement, experience, and maintain its resilience as it grows so people are not losing the money. So you can really kind of just push it and adopt it.  How do you deal with the stress of leading one of the most important DeFi projects?  It’s really hard for me to explain how I dealt with it in the past because it was really crazy. The early days of crypto were so insane – unreal situations, crazy drama, crazy personalities, a lot of toxicity. The main way I dealt with it is that the more I tried to improve what we were trying to build – making something useful for people – the better things got. Gradually, things have just been getting better and better.  Even dealing with Endgame – this massive change – is nothing compared to the early days of Maker.  Are you still thinking about making an MMORPG?  I actually have a gaming company that's building an MMORPG that I founded around the time the Maker Foundation wound down.  Being in Europe, are you at all concerned about the Tornado Cash verdict? I ask because the judge essentially said founders could be criminally liable for code they release that they suspect could be misused.  I think the problem with privacy technology is that it attracts a lot of bad guys and illicit use. There’s naturally a large illicit user base. But there are also way more legitimate users. It's like a road, bad people use the roads, but the vast majority are regular people. It's a big challenge, because we need privacy technology, right? We have a right to privacy, but these tools often end up as honeypots in a sense.  But obviously Maker has always focused on having good relationships with regulators because we want adoption by regular people. And we've achieved that. A lot of people use and benefit from the system, which makes it dramatically different from something like Tornado Cash.  Today’s announcement of a completely decentralized stablecoin detached from Maker wouldn’t have KYC though, by definition. It seems like prosecutors, when they can't shut something down, try to put a person behind the code.  Yeah, but again it comes back to whether it has some kind of legitimate use. The point is if you're making it easy to do bad things with this technology. There is no privacy on the blockchain, right? Everything is totally transparent. You have Chainalysis monitoring everything. Mixers thwart that. The best example of all is the banking system, because this is happening all the time at a much greater scale. You can be fully anonymous in crypto if you're just smart enough. But in the banking system, it's actually pretty easy because you just need to bribe a few corrupt bankers or something like that. It's pretty straightforward. So the thing that would get risky for us, even though I think, again, that there is a moral obligation to figure out how to do this in a way that doesn't just disproportionately benefit criminals, is to build a privacy solution into a decentralized currency.  It's very hard to do that safely and without becoming a target. We're definitely not going to build you know, native privacy into pure DAI or anything like that.  Do you want to do a quick round of Overrated/Underrated?  OK.  Solana?  Underrated.  Life extension research?  Overrated.  Ai risk research?  Overrated.  AI itself?  Underrated.  CBDCs?  Overrated.  Blockchain gaming?  Overrated.  Could you say why?  I think it has a ton of potential, but I'm really disappointed in basically almost everything. The amount of attempts and quality of the attempts is just very disappointing.  There’s something wrong with the culture – like, everyone's just doing it for the money. And it's pushing away real builders who are never going to touch the blockchain gaming industry. If you had the right people trying to do it, you could build some really cool things and we'll get there. But the signal-to-noise ratio is crazy.  How much MKR do you own or control?  You can log onto Etherscan and find my wallet. It's pretty easy.  Is there anything that you want to talk about?  I mean, the only thing that's important to me right now is just how impactful launch season will be. There are many new things coming and it can be quite difficult to explain – there'll be a new brand, new token, new app. There'll be these different options if you’re a DAI holder that you can choose. It's really, really powerful stuff.  See also: MakerDAO Founder Proposes Plan for Upgraded Governance  We spent two years just distilling all the things that have been learned basically since the beginning of DeFi. And then we are sort of launching all the key aspects of those, but trying to make it simple and easy to use. The killer feature is yield farming, which I think will be relevant for a lot of people. But it's hard to explain in advance that you will be able to save money with low risk, like you're used to with stablecoins, but now you can get these very interesting and valuable tokens as you do it.  Yield farming is sometimes described as a marketing expense. Would you agree with that?  Yeah, I think that was kind of the old version of yield farming that others have done. But nowadays we have designed a system where the yield side actually makes the protocol sustainable. What was risky before, even if you were doing it with stablecoins, is that you were doing it in untested, brand-new smart contracts. So there's gonna be a lot of technical risk. In our case, there is no technical risk – or very low technical risk – because it's just as safe as all the other components of the Maker system. There’s financial risk, but with the new subDAOs and tokens there will be a lot of incentives.  In 10 years where do you think Tether will be?  I think it would probably be even bigger than it is today. They are reaching escape velocity and they're not even paying any yield. They're just growing and growing and growing because it's so useful. The number one thing that makes a stablecoin useful is the network effect, right? People use tether because everyone else uses it, so they already have that flywheel.  We definitely hope to get to that point as well. But fundamentally the bed we're making with Endgame is we can't guarantee we get to that point at least within some timeframe we can control. So we are really focusing on the yield aspect so we have a growth driver that is independent from requiring this huge network effect.  But then we may be able to use this yield growth driver to build up a huge network of users and start to get this sort of compounding effect. It could be very successful and profitable, even if it was never used as a currency at all. Maybe it's just like a savings account to tether or something like that.  This was great, good luck. I appreciate the candid responses.

Record-Breaking Demand For Bitcoin ETFs According to Bloomberg, the success of Bitcoin ETFs introduced by BlackRock and Fidelity Investments has made them some of the most successful launches in the ETF sector’s history. These products have significantly influenced the center of gravity for cryptocurrency investments, shifting it from Asia to the United States. Related Reading: Buy Now, Crypto Bull Market Returns, Says Arthur Hayes Sean Farrell, Head of Digital Asset Strategy at Fundstrat, noted the significant inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs and highlighted that the macroeconomic environment favors the cryptocurrency market. Economic growth is advancing at a “non-recessionary pace” and signs of disinflation persist. Recently, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, with $21.4 billion in assets, became the world’s largest Bitcoin fund, surpassing Grayscale’s $20.1 billion Bitcoin trust (GBTC). On the other hand, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), with $12.3 billion in assets, currently holds the third position. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which had been cautious about digital assets, reluctantly permitted spot Bitcoin ETFs in January due to a court reversal in its lawsuit against Grayscale in 2023. Although the SEC remains critical of the digital asset industry’s compliance with regulations, recent efforts in Congress to establish clearer legislative frameworks for cryptocurrencies have gained momentum. BTC Options Traders Target $100.00 In addition to the Bitcoin ETF inflows, options traders are increasingly optimistic about Bitcoin’s future. Open interest is concentrated on call options with strike prices of $75,000, $100,000, and $80,000. Luuk Strijers, CEO of Deribit, the largest crypto options exchange, noted the bullish sentiment in the BTC options market. Traders anticipate new all-time highs, driven by strong Bitcoin ETF flows, expectations of US interest rate cuts, the European Central Bank’s rate cuts, and the recent approval of an ETH ETF. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index Has Turned Positive At 0.006, Why This Is Important While Bitcoin experienced a minor retreat from its record high of $73,700 set in March, renewed inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and expectations of interest rate cuts have reignited optimism among traders. Call options expiring in late June and December are particularly active, indicating a positive short- and long-term outlook. As of press time, the largest cryptocurrency on the market has successfully consolidated above the $70,000 milestone. Its gains over the past seven days amount to 5%, favoring the price of BTC and resulting in a current value of $71,320.

Prior to the livestream, GameStop (GME) shares tumbled 25% in the morning hours of the Friday session after the company rushed out a first quarter earnings report and a 75 million share offering in wake of the large run higher in the stock this week.  Shares continued lower during Gill's appearance as he attempted to lay out his long-term bull case on GameStop. They're currently lower by 40% for the day.  Solana-based meme token GME, which was inspired by the company but has no affiliation with it, almost doubled in price in less than a day before sharply paring gains on Friday. At press time it was down 50% over the preceding few hours, though still higher by more than three-fold this week.  Gill returned to social media last month after three years of silence, unleashing a speculative frenzy for GameStop that spilled over to the memecoin market with multiple opportunistic tokens launching on the Solana blockchain.  Thursday, Gill revealed in a Reddit post that his stock and options position was worth $586 million at the time.

29088613,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611916,1717779648,Bitcoin On The Verge As Global Liquidity Nears New $100 Million ATH,"Philip Swift, the founder of the on-chain analytics platform LookIntoBitcoin, recently highlighted the significant increase in global liquidity, which just hit a new all-time high (ATH). Swift suggested this was a crucial indicator of how Bitcoin can rise in this bull run. The Most Important Indicator For Bitcoin Swift claimed that the global liquidity was the “most important” chart in this bull run while revealing that it had just hit a new ATH. The chart he shared showed that the global liquidity was now at $94 trillion and approaching the $100 trillion mark. Based on his analysis, this development could also lead to new ATHs for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Open Interest Returns To February 2024 Levels, What Happened Last Time? Global liquidity was around $90 trillion when BTC hit its previous ATH of $69,000 in the 2021 bull run. Additionally, Bitcoin’s price has risen above that level since global liquidity, thereby confirming the correlation between this global liquidity indicator and Bitcoin’s price. Swift claimed that Bitcoin’s rise is “inevitable” as long as global liquidity keeps trending. Swift mentioned that BTC had a “long way to go” after it hit a new ATH of $73,750 in March. He made reference to the MVRV z-score indicator, which showed that the flagship crypto was still well below its fair value. In a recent X post, the crypto founder suggested that Bitcoin would at least rise above $100,000 before the market top can be said to be in. Swift claimed that the Bitcoin cycle top indicators were continuing to climb higher. These top indicators were the delta top, terminal price, and top cap, which were at $137,579, $148,390, and $364,541, respectively. Meanwhile, like Swift, crypto analyst Tarekonchain recently highlighted the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) indicator and mentioned that Bitcoin was still far from its peak. Based on this, the analyst predicted that BTC could still achieve new highs in this cycle and possibly rise above $100,000. BTC On The Brink Of History Crypto analyst Rekt Capital mentioned that Bitcoin could soon make history if a breakout happens soon enough. He claimed that if that happens, this will be the fastest Bitcoin has ever broken out from a post-halving Re-Accumulation range. A successful breakout from this range will send Bitcoin into the “parabolic phase” of the cycle, when it is expected to reach new highs and potentially rise above $100,000. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whale Enter Buying Frenzy, 715 Billion SHIB Snapped Up In Days Interestingly, Standard Chartered Bank predicted that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 even before the US Presidential election takes place in November. The bank further predicted that BTC could reach $150,000 by year-end if Republican candidate Donald Trump emerges victorious at the polls. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $71,000, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

29084614,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611935,1717774201,"VC Lists 2 Reasons Why Bitcoin Is Still Trending Below $100,000","Bitcoin traders are upbeat, confident that bulls have more legs to push prices above $72,000 and all-time highs. While the excitement about what lies ahead is primarily due to the mass inflow into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Charles Edwards, the founder of Capriole Investments, has picked out multiple factors capping the current uptrend to $100,000. Here’s Why Bitcoin Is Still Trading Below $100,000 In a post on X, Edwards said several factors combine to suppress gains. However, most relate to a tussle between new institutional money and a wave of long-term holder selling. Roughly six months after the first batch of spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), billions continue to flow to these derivative products. Related Reading: Injective (INJ) Price Set To Skyrocket 33% On Classic Bullish Signal: Crypto Analyst According to Lookonchain, all nine spot BTC ETF issuers in the United States added 6,907 BTC worth over $492 million on June 6. Fidelity added 3,104 BTC, while BlackRock bought 2,186 BTC. Encouragingly, following sharp gains on May 20, institutions have been increasingly buying more BTC, gaining exposure through spot ETFs. Over the past half year or so, Edwards notes that spot Bitcoin ETF issuers in the United States have been aggressively accumulating. So far, they have bought 200% of all BTC mined since their debut in January. What this means is that there is a steady and impressive stream of institutional investment flowing to Bitcoin. BTC prices have been trending higher in response to this development, breaking above 2021 highs and printing fresh all-time highs in March 2024. Related Reading: Crypto On Watch: Will ECB Rate Cut Fuel Bitcoin Rally? Though the uptrend is clear, the pace of expansion is discouraging. Edwards notes that more and more long-term holders are actively selling. Their share of the total supply has been shrinking since the December 2023 peak of 57%, falling to 54%, reducing 630,000 BTC in the process. This figure dwarfs the total holdings of all BTC accumulated by spot Bitcoin ETF issuers in the United States. Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows, USD Liquidity, And Long-term Holder Behavior Are Key Amid this wait, the founder thinks Bitcoin could still exceed local resistance and rally to $100,000. For this level to be tested, there must be a spike in institutional appetite for BTC, even pushing daily purchases to over $1 billion. Additionally, long-term holders must slow down their liquidation, reducing supply. If this prints out as the M2 money supply in the United States increases, the coin could surpass expectations, breaking out from the current range.

42417954,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc9Cn,1717769226,Customers Bank Said to Debank Some Digital Asset Hedge Funds,"Customers Bank has debanked a number of crypto hedge funds in recent weeks, three people said.  One person said the move was mainly housekeeping and the offboarding of inactive accounts.  To limit its exposure to digital assets the bank has capped deposits from crypto clients at 15% of total deposits.  Customers Bank, which services some of the largest names in crypto including Galaxy Digital (GLXY), Coinbase (COIN) and Circle, has told some hedge-fund clients it can no longer provide them with banking services, according to three people familiar with the matter.  Whilst the extent of the cull is unclear, one person said ""a load of funds"" were involved. A second person said the action represented the offboarding of inactive accounts rather than the widespread debanking of the industry. A third person said their digital assets financial services firm had spoken to a number of funds looking for new providers in recent weeks, potentially as a result of the offboarding of accounts at Customers.  This latest development highlights the difficulty that some crypto companies have in accessing the U.S. dollar banking system in the aftermath of the collapse of Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank last year.  The West Reading, Pennsylvania-based company, which is owned by Customers Bancorp (CUBI), deals only in U.S. dollars and does not accept cryptocurrency or make loans to support crypto activities. It offers its clients, estimated at well over a hundred digital asset firms, a real-time blockchain-based payments platform called Customer Bank Instant Token (CBIT) that allows crypto clients to make U.S. dollar payments 24/7.  A spokesperson for Customers Bank declined to comment on the policy, saying only that the bank was choosy as to who it took on as a client. To limit its exposure to crypto, the bank has capped deposits in CBIT, which delivers almost instant settlement and does not charge any fees.  “We have previously discussed publicly our 15% cap on deposits in the CBIT vertical,"" the spokesperson said. ""As a result of that policy limitation, we are understandably selective with respect to new business. In each of the industries that we serve, we perform extensive due diligence and seek to onboard only high-caliber clients. The digital assets industry is no exception.”  Total deposits at the end of the first quarter were about $18 billion, with CBIT contributing around $2 billion.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/06/07/customers-bank-said-to-debank-some-digital-asset-hedge-funds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e6d4893b984d6477e0f272dc38d1085fb10b95ea-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

29080631,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611924,1717768829,"Polkadot (DOT) Forms Rising Wedge Pattern, Bullish Or Bearish?","Polkadot (DOT), a popular cryptocurrency in the blockchain space, has been making waves with its innovative approach to interoperability and scalability. However, like any financial asset, its price movement is subject to various technical analysis patterns, one of which is the rising wedge chart pattern. The formation of a rising wedge pattern on DOT’s price chart suggests that despite its recent upward trajectory, there could be a downturn on the horizon. Traders and investors often watch for confirmation signals such as a break below the lower base of the wedge to confirm the pattern’s validity and anticipate potential selling pressure. Currently, the price of DOT is down by -0.13%, trading at about $7.13, with a market capitalization of over $10 billion and a trading volume of over $153 Million as of the time of writing. Although its market capitalization is down by 0.39%, its trading volume is up by 0.34% in the past day. With the help of the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), and Relative Strength Index (RSI), this analysis was carried out using both the 4-hour and daily timeframe. Analytical View Of DOT’s Current Price Condition Currently, in the 4-hour chart, DOT is still moving in a consolidation manner, with the upper base and the lower base of the wedge building up momentum below the 100-day simple moving average. The 4-hour relative strength index is signaling that the price of DOT might break below the lower base of the wedge as the RSI line is seen trending a bit below the 50% level. From this RSI formation, it can be suggested that if DOT breaks below the wedge, it will begin to move downward toward the closest key support level. Meanwhile, in the 1-day chart, DOT’s price is seen trending within the wedge but close to the lower base. The 1-day RSI also suggests that DOT might go bearish as the RSI line is attempting to cross below the 50% level. From this RSI formation, it is advised that investors should watch out for a break below the wedge before taking any sell positions. Potential Price Action In The Event Of A Breakout Presently, the crypto asset’s price is still moving within the wedge, and DOT will begin to decline in the direction of the $4.8 support level in the event that there is a breakout below the wedge. If the price falls below the aforementioned level, it might perhaps fall further to test the $3.5 support level. On the other hand, if the price reverses course and breaks above the wedge’s upper base, it will begin to rise toward the $9,8 resistance level. Should it break above this level, Polkadot will go higher to test the $11.9 resistance level. In addition, DOT might see a stronger rise to test more significant levels if it closes above $11.9.

The May unemployment rate was 4.0% versus estimates for 3.9% and April's 3.9%.  The price of bitcoin {{BTC}} fell sharply from a two-month high just shy of $72,000 in the minutes following the numbers. At press time, BTC was changing hands at $70,900, down 0.5% over the past 24 hours.  Wage data from this morning's report shows average hourly earnings rising 0.4% in May versus forecasts for 0.3% and April's 0.2%. On a year-over-year basis, average hourly earnings were higher by 4.1% versus estimates for 3.9% and April's 4.0%.  After rising through the first part of 2024, interest rates have been on a downtrend over about the last five weeks as some recent U.S. economic data had pointed to a slowdown in both economic growth and inflation – the 10-year Treasury yield ahead of this morning's numbers was at 4.30% versus a 2024 high of 4.71% in late April.  The move down in rates has been a boon for risk assets, with the major U.S. stock market averages surging to record highs and the price of bitcoin rising from about the $60,000 level to within close range of its record high just above $73,500.  Ideas that the major Western economies are about to fully enter a monetary easing cycle received further merit this week when both the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank slashed their respective benchmark interest rates for the first time in several years. As for the U.S., the odds of a Fed rate cut have risen sharply of late, with investors prior to this morning's report having priced in about a 55% chance of a move on or before the bank's September policy meeting.  With today's strong numbers, much of this thinking is likely to be reversed in at least the short term. In addition to bitcoin's swift pullback, the 10-year Treasury yield has shot higher by 12 basis points to 4.42% and U.S. stock index futures are pointing to a lower open. Checking other indicators, the U.S. dollar has surged 0.5% and gold has tumbled more than 2%.  Bloomberg Chief Economist Anna Wong has an interesting contrary take on the data, suggesting the rise in the unemployment rate is the more important indicator of the reality of the employment situation. ""[The government] model for estimating business births and deaths – which added 231,000 jobs to the nonfarm-payrolls print in May – is lagging the reality of surging establishment closures and falling business formation. We think the underlying pace of current job gains is likely less than 100,000 per month.""",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/06/07/us-added-272k-jobs-in-may-blowing-past-estimates-unemployment-rates-rises-to-40,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/141f1f99c0d71e1adf83dae53fae8482f9a3a360-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

29076721,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611915,1717763447,"Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index Has Turned Positive At 0.006, Why This Is Important","The Bitcoin recent foray into $70,000 price territory has again become a hot topic among investors, with many looking at a positive price outlook. As a result of this fascinating price action, the vast majority of long-term holders have seen their holdings cross into profit zone. Particularly, the positive outlook seems to be positive among US-based investors, as shown by the Coinbase premium turning positive. Some see the return of the Coinbase premium as a bullish signal that could continue to drive the price higher. Coinbase Premium Index Flips Positive The Coinbase Premium Index (CPI), which had been trading in the negative since May 18, has now turned positive, according to a cryptocurrency analyst who cited data from CryptoQuant. The Coinbase Premium refers to the difference in Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase versus other major exchanges. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whale Enter Buying Frenzy, 715 Billion SHIB Snapped Up In Days When the premium turns positive, it means Bitcoin is trading at a higher price on Coinbase compared to Binance and, subsequently, other major crypto exchanges. This is important because it shows increased demand for Bitcoin on one of the largest US-based crypto exchanges. On the other hand, a negative premium indicates a lack of substantial buying pressure from US-based traders. Since Coinbase is a popular entry point for new US crypto investors, a premium price indicates money is flowing into Bitcoin. At the time of writing, data from CryptoQuant shows that this premium recently reached 13.11. While this may seem small, it definitely indicates the beginning of buying pressure that could send Bitcoin on another leg higher Interestingly, this flip into a positive Coinbase premium has come with a less bullish outlook on Bitcoin among Korean and Asian-based investors, at least in the short term. This information is revealed by CryptoQuant’s Korea Premium Index, which has been on a downtrend in the past two weeks. Bitcoin Continues To Hold Strong At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $71,095 and is up by 4.31% amidst increased buying momentum, with the Bitcoin Open Interest recently reaching its all-time high. While a positive Coinbase Premium is a bullish indicator, the context around why it’s happening matters greatly in determining where Bitcoin’s price may go next. Related Reading: VanEck Revises Ethereum Prediction To Put Price At $22,000, Here’s Why A large part of the positive premium could be attributed to individual large holders called whales, with on-chain data showing instances of huge Bitcoin transfers from Coinbase to unknown private wallets. As mentioned earlier, a sustained positive premium and interest from institutions and retail buyers is the most promising scenario for Bitcoin to build on. However, interest from Coinbase whales alone may not be enough to fuel a prolonged, substantial price rally. For Bitcoin to continue its upward trajectory, there must be a corresponding rise in the interest shown by retail investors.

Bernstein said that by acquiring an exchange the trading platform can offer markets in many more tokens.  JMP said it doesn't expect material accretion from the deal.  Robinhood’s (HOOD) acquisition of Bitstamp is a strategic move by the trading platform to expand its crypto business and positions the company well against competitors such as Coinbase (COIN) and Kraken, broker Bernstein said in a research report on Friday.  The broker notes that Bitstamp, as one of the oldest exchanges that offers crypto, Robinhood has “stood the test of time over multiple cycles.”  Robinhood offers 15 cryptocurrencies to retail investors in the U.S. and more than 30 tokens in Europe, whereas Bitstamp lists over 85 tokens, the report said. By acquiring an exchange the trading platform can offer markets in a lot more tokens.  “With a full exchange, HOOD gets access to global liquidity, and thus can offer the liquidity to its own broker platform, potentially improving its economics,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote.  Exchanges offer a wide range of services such as staking, stablecoins, trading, custody and prime broking, the note said. The acquisition of Bitstamp potentially allows Robinhood to offer a wider range of crypto products to a more institutional client base. Bernstein has an outperform rating on Robinhood stock with a $30 price target. The shares were little changed in early trading on Friday at around $23.  Broker JMP said the acquisition of Bitstamp will “drive opportunities to broaden Robinhood’s participation in the evolving crypto value chain,” in a report on Thursday. Owning an exchange will give Robinhood opportunities to connect more deeply into the crypto ecosystem and could allow the platform to get more involved in the tokenization of assets and securities, the report said.  The acquisition will give Robinhood more exposure to institutional clients and will accelerate the company’s buildout in Europe, the report added.  As Bitstamp is marginally profitable at best, JMP said it does not expect material accretion from the deal. JMP has an outperform rating on the stock with a $30 price target.

Riot Platforms has made a bid to takeover smaller mining peer Bitfarms. Following the rejection, RIOT has begun a hostile takeover attempt by acquiring 12% of BITF. Given the recent block reward halving, I suspect Riot Platforms will benefit from power credit optionality. This is not an advantage shared by peers. One of the Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) miners that has lagged the peer group year to date and over the last 12 months is Riot Platforms, Inc. ( RIOT ). Down 12% over the last year while other mining peers have doubled and in some cases even quadrupled, RIOT has been a disappointing ticker for mining stockholders at down almost 10%: Data by YCharts Riot is a company that I've covered for Seeking Alpha in the past. I've previously been bullish on the name last year due to the company's mix of EH/s capacity, debt-free balance sheet, and large unencumbered BTC stack. However, in my most recent article covering the company in February, I was less enthusiastic about the name and downgraded the stock to a ""hold"" due to what I viewed as efficiency concerns from the underlying business. A lot has happened in the four months since that coverage. In this update, we'll look at the company's recent bid to takeover smaller mining peer Bitfarms Ltd. ( BITF ), early post-halving production figures, and revenue trends to consider as Texas enters what could be yet another hot summer. Bitfarms Takeover Bid EH/s Trend (Author's chart, company filings) Less than two years ago, Riot Platforms was the second-largest Bitcoin miner by exahash capacity after only Core Scientific, Inc. ( CORZ ). Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. ( MARA ) has impressively scaled to the top spot over the last 12 months. But today, Riot finds itself behind even CleanSpark, Inc. ( CLSK ) which has quickly catapulted to a top-tier miner. Given Riot's nearly $1.3 billion in balance sheet liquidity between cash and Bitcoin, it's not surprising to see the company already being active as Bitcoin mining faces consolidation. On June 5th, Riot Platforms disclosed owning 12% of the outstanding common shares in Bitfarms stock. This is after reporting 10% ownership about a week prior. Riot's disclosure of its beneficial ownership in Bitfarms comes about a month after making a buyout offer directly to the company at $2.30 per share. Per a prior disclosure : In particular, on April 22, 2024, Riot sent a letter to the Board that set out Riot's non-binding proposal to acquire all of the outstanding Common Shares of the Company (the "" Proposal "") for consideration of US$2.30 per Common Share, to be paid with a combination of cash and shares of Riot's common stock (the "" Purchase Price ""). The Board of Directors for Bitfarms rejected Riot's offer and recently announced a strategic review as the company attempts to figure out a path forward with buyout sharks apparently in the water. It should be noted that Bitfarms disclosed additional unsolicited expressions of interest in the company, though no specific names of additional suitors have been made public. It also bears mentioning that Bitfarms doesn't have an acting CEO and is being sued by its last CEO for alleged wrongful dismissal and breach of contract. Data by YCharts Per Riot's June 5th disclosure, the company is seeking presence on the company's board of directors: Riot currently intends to requisition a special meeting of the Company's shareholders, at which Riot intends to nominate several well-qualified and independent directors to join the Company's board of directors (the "" Board ""), which follows from Riot's serious concerns regarding the Board's track record of poor corporate governance. Given Riot Platforms' increased position in BITF stock, we appear to have a hostile takeover attempt happening in real-time. As of the article submission, Bitfarms shares are 8% above Riot's original buyout offer price. But at 7.5 operational EH/s for the month of May, Bitfarms' post-halving Bitcoin production isn't terribly far off from what Riot averaged in the month when accounting for curtailment. From Riot's vantage, taking over Bitfarms' operations is a fast way to grow operations in line with tier-1 peers without having to ship or energize machines. If Bitfarms does indeed have additional suitors who are willing to pay a higher price, it works to Riot's advantage since it's now such a large shareholder in the company. Post-Halving Production & Power Credit Strategy Riot Platforms has been slower to scale than other companies in the space. The latest production data from May shows a production figure that has predictably cratered following the block reward halving in late April: Monthly Production Figures (Author's chart, Riot Platforms disclosures) At just 215 BTC mined in May on 8.8 average operating EH/s, Riot's BTC per EH/s figure in the month was 24.4. Bitfarm's May figure was virtually the same. May is an important signal to the market because it's our first indication of the viability of many of these companies in a post-halving environment. For Riot, May shows the fourth consecutive month of what amounts to a HODL strategy for the company, as it has kept all BTC produced. Between June and September 2023, Riot Platforms reported $63.1 million in total power credits. This was against $40.3 million in BTC sales at an average price of just under $28k. As of the article submission, the price of BTC is nearly $71k. Thus, even with the reduced block reward following the halving, the price of Bitcoin is more than double what it was last year when Riot Platforms found energy credits to be the better strategy. Monthly Revenue Sources (Author's chart, Riot Platforms disclosures) Yet despite what is few as terrific gains in the price of BTC over the last year, we can already observe Riot's willingness to curtail as May 2024 resulted in $7.3 million in energy credits - a 160% increase over May 2023. And again, May was the fourth consecutive month that Riot didn't sell any of its BTC production. Acquisitions aside, Riot's revenue path over the next four months boils down to something that is largely out of the company's control: June Temperatures (NOAA) June and July have both been previously forecasted to be hotter-than-average months for the state of Texas, with August and September being closer to normal. A more time-sensitive update from NOAA (graph above) shows a high probability of above-normal temperatures for nearly the entire state. While the company endured negative press because of its energy credits last year, RIOT's stock responded very well to the strategy: Data by YCharts Risks As I see it, the worst-case scenario for Riot Platforms from an unapologetic business standpoint would be Bitcoin's price declines and Texas simultaneously having a moderate to cool summer. If these things were to happen together, Riot's power credit revenue would likely disappoint and the reality of operating mining machines in a post-halving world would impact the company's bottom line. I would say that each of these factors are out of the control of the company. Summary From where I sit, Riot Platforms is an interesting trade idea, but probably not a great long-term investment. Between now and likely the end of September, Riot should be able to benefit from power credit optionality. If it's hot and Bitcoin's price returns are lackluster, Riot can instead go the energy route for monetizing power. This is not something that every public miner is able to do, so it gives Riot Platforms an advantage in the event Bitcoin's summer month price languishes. Alternatively, if Bitcoin's price rockets higher, and it's more economical to keep the machines running, Riot will benefit from its pivot to an HODL strategy and its Bitfarms equity will likely appreciate. There's admittedly a lot of ""ifs"" and guesses here, but that's the nature of the speculation game.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4697992-riot-platforms-a-summer-of-hostility-and-energy-credits?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/29075153.jpeg
42417969,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc9QD,1717761241,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Futures Positions Top Record $37B as Analysts Predict Bitcoin Surge to $83K,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin traders set a record for futures positions, with open interest surpassing $37.7 billion. The previous record of just under $37 billion was set in March, when bitcoin hit an all-time high of over $73,000. The jump comes a day after spot bitcoin ETFs extended their net inflows streak to 18 days, also a record. The long-short ratio in BTC futures surpassed 1, meaning there are more positions betting on the price rising than declining. BTC is currently priced at around $71,340, an increase of 0.5% in the last 24 hours. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), has dipped by around 0.2%.  Bitcoin could be primed for a surge to $83,000, according to analysis by 10x Research. The breakout is contingent on BTC moving above $72,000 to complete an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern in which an asset experiences three price troughs with the middle one being the deepest. This pattern suggests it is ""only a matter of time"" before the BTC price reaches a new high, 10x founder Markus Thielen said. A breakout above $72,000, a mere 1% climb above its current price of around $71,300, may hinge on U.S. nonfarm payrolls data, scheduled for release at 08:30 ET. Weak data may strengthen the case for Fed interest-rate cuts, adding to upward momentum in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  Health-care company Semler Scientific, which has previously extended its corporate strategy to buying bitcoin, said on Thursday it is purchasing $17 million worth of BTC and preparing to raise $150 million so it can buy more. The company's 828 bitcoin were acquired for $57 million and are now worth $59 million, according to market data from CoinDesk Indices. Collectively, publicly listed companies hold 308,442 BTC worth approximately $21.8 billion on their balance sheets, according to bitcointreasuries.net. Semler's announcement in late May that it was purchasing $40 million in bitcoin sent its stock up 25%. SMLR shares have risen just over 3% in pre-market trading.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the best-fit line between the weekly percentage change in bitcoin's price and the money flow indicator. The latter represents inflows through spot ETFs, stablecoins and futures.  The analysis shows a positive correlation coefficient of 0.60 between the two since the ETFs began trading in mid-January and a coefficient of determination (r2) of 0.36.  The r2 of 0.36 indicates that inflows through ETFs and other instruments only have moderate influence on bitcoin's price.

29072838,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611905,1717758164,Injective (INJ) Price Set To Skyrocket 33% On Classic Bullish Signal: Crypto Analyst,"In an analysis shared on X, renowned crypto analyst Josh Olszewicz (@CarpeNoctom) forecasts a significant 33% rise in the price of Injective (INJ) based on a classic bullish chart pattern known as the inverted head and shoulders (iH&S). The chart suggests a strong reversal possibility from recent bearish trends, potentially steering the cryptocurrency’s price to new local highs. Injective Price Prepares For Lift-Off The iH&S pattern, prominently featured in Olszewicz’s chart, is a revered formation among technical analysts for predicting bullish reversals following a downward trend. This pattern is identified by three troughs: the middle trough (head) being the deepest and flanked by two shallower troughs (shoulders), which are approximately of similar depth. Related Reading: Injective Market-Shaking News Drives INJ Price Up By 7% – Details On the chart, the left shoulder forms around mid-April, dipping below $23.50. The head is seen in May, dropping to a low near $21.08. The formation completes with the right shoulder in early June, reaching down around $23.90, mirroring the left shoulder. The neckline, which is a key component in this pattern, is drawn across the peaks that connect the shoulders and the head. On Olszewicz’s chart, this line is positioned at approximately $28.70. A breakout above this neckline is typically interpreted as confirmation of the pattern’s completion and an impending bullish trend. According to the chart, the price of INJ is about to break above this critical threshold. The analyst’s chart also integrates the Ichimoku Cloud, which provides a dynamic look at potential support and resistance areas. Presently, the price of INJ is hovering near the lower edge of a red cloud, indicating an upcoming resistance zone, which traders might watch closely. Related Reading: Injective (INJ) Buy Signal That Led To 700% & 555% Rallies Forms Again Further enriching the analysis are the Fibonacci extension levels drawn from the lowest point of the head to the neckline of the iH&S pattern. These levels project potential price targets if the bullish breakout is confirmed. The 1.618 Fibonacci extension is marked at $34.74, and a more ambitious 2.0 extension reaches $39.09. These targets represent potential resistance levels where traders might take profits, hence they are crucial for understanding possible future price movements. Josh Olszewicz’s reliance on the iH&S pattern combined with other technical indicators such as the Ichimoku Cloud and Fibonacci extensions presents a comprehensive view. This analysis suggests that INJ’s price could escalate towards $34.74 and might even extend to $39.09, marking a 33% increase from the current price. Investors and traders need to monitor INJ’s price movement closely, keeping an eye on trading volumes and market sentiment which could either accelerate or hinder the predicted bullish momentum. At press time, INJ traded at $29.51.

The bullish breakout is likely to happen on Friday or next week.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} may be setting up for a rise to $83,000 as it completes a major bullish price pattern on the daily chart, according to technical analysis by 10x Research.  A price move above $72,000 would confirm a breakout from an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern, characterized by three price troughs, with the middle one being the deepest.  ""It is only a matter of time until bitcoin makes a new all-time high. The head-and-shoulders formation suggests a rally towards 83,000 soon, with the resistance line likely broken within the next few days. The ideal time for this resistance to break is either today, Friday, June 7, or next week, Wednesday, June 12,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a note shared with CoinDesk.  According to technical analysis theory, the inverted head-and-shoulders pattern usually forms after a downtrend and reverses the trend upwards after a breakout. The pattern rarely appears in an upward-trending market, signaling a bullish continuation.  The breakout above $72,000 hinges on the U.S. nonfarm payrolls data scheduled for release on Friday at 12:30 UTC.  According to Bloomberg, economists' consensus estimate is that the economy created 180,000 jobs in May, nearly matching April's 175,000 gain. The unemployment rate is expected to remain at 3.9% in May. The median estimate for average hourly earnings is a 0.3% increase, a tick above April's pace, leading to a 12-month wage growth of 3.9% for the second consecutive month.

The unanimous vote by all 20 national representatives slashed rates by 0.25%, marking a significant shift in monetary policy for the Eurozone. Coupled with projections of slowing inflation and modest economic growth, this move has sparked intense speculation in the crypto market, with many analysts predicting a notable rise in Bitcoin prices. Related Reading: VanEck Predicts Explosive Ethereum Growth: Could ETH Reach $2.2 Trillion? ECB Pivots Towards Growth The ECB’s decision reflects a growing concern about the Eurozone’s economic health. Inflation, initially a major point of focus, is now expected to cool down to 1.9% by 2026. However, the projected GDP growth of 0.9% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2026 paints a picture of sluggish economic activity. By lowering interest rates, the ECB aims to stimulate borrowing and investment, potentially jumpstarting the Eurozone’s growth engine. The European Central Bank announced the first rate cut in five years, 25bps. The ECB expects inflation to be 2.5% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025, and 1.9% in 2026. GDP growth is expected to be 0.9% in 2024, 1.4% in 2025, and 1.6% in 2026. https://t.co/vtft9WFAX7 — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 6, 2024 Cryptocurrency Bonanza? The ECB’s dovish turn has sent a jolt of excitement through the cryptocurrency community. Lower interest rates typically translate to a weaker Euro. This, in turn, could make dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin more attractive to investors seeking diversification and a hedge against inflation. Analysts believe this, combined with potential future rate cuts, could propel Bitcoin to new highs. The market is hungry for signals, and the ECB’s move is a clear indication of a global shift towards looser monetary policy, crypto analysts said. This creates a fertile ground for Bitcoin, potentially attracting investors looking for alternatives to low-yielding traditional assets. A Symphony Of Central Banks The ECB’s decision follows a similar move by the Bank of Canada, which became the first major central bank to cut rates this year. This coordinated effort by central banks underscores a growing concern about a potential global economic slowdown.

Crypto Traders Are Placing 50% Odds,"Market watchers expect Keith Gill, known as Roaring Kitty, to potentially reach a billion-dollar position in GameStop stock by Friday.  Polymarket bets on Gill becoming a billionaire have gained traction, with ""yes"" odds rising to 50.  Market watchers are widely backing retail stock trader Keith Gill to clear a billion dollars on his GameStop (GME) stock positions by Friday in what could become one of the biggest meme-stock trading success stories.  Gill, popularly known by his X account @TheRoaringKitty and Reddit account “DeepF*ckingValue” aliases – he doesn't use an asterisk on the platform – flashed a $583 million position in a Reddit post on Thursday, showing $382 million in profit across options and equity positions. GME stock added 47% to $46 yesterday and surged to $61 in after-hours trading.  Followers on Reddit quickly did the math and calculated that GME needed to add just $9 on Friday to give Gill a billion-dollar exposure to the video game retailer's stocks.  Polymarket bets on Gill clearing the 10-digit mark on his brokerage account have quickly found favor among investors. The “Roaring Kitty billionaire by Friday?” market has racked up $120,000 in bets since going live late on Thursday, with “yes” odds climbing since early Asian hours on Friday – reaching 50%.  “If GME hits 70$, the intrinsic value of his position would reach a billion. (5m shares * 70$) + (12m shares from calls * (70$ - 20$ strike)),” said user “etj103007,” who purchased 15,000 shares in favor.  “I believe in Roaring Kitty,” said another user who held 1,000 “yes” shares.  The market will resolve to “yes” if @TheRoaringKitty announces that he is a billionaire or otherwise shows a brokerage position of at least $1 billion dollars in value by 11:59 PM ET tonight. The resolution source for this market will be information from Gill or his known social accounts.  Meanwhile, a spoof GME token on the Solana blockchain has racked up nearly $200 million in trading volumes in the past 24 hours, largely driven by Gill’s social updates.

29065133,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611885,1717747220,"Buy Now, Crypto Bull Market Returns, Says Arthur Hayes","In a new essay titled “Group of Fools,” Arthur Hayes, the outspoken co-founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, casts a critical eye over recent macroeconomic developments and their implications for the crypto market. Hayes, known for his direct and often provocative commentary, employs a blend of technical analysis, central banking critique, and currency market insights to build a case for what he believes is the return of a Bitcoin and crypto bull market. A “Group Of Fools” He begins by emphasizing the significance of the dollar-yen exchange rate as a macroeconomic barometer. According to Hayes, this metric crucially influences global financial stability and policy decisions. “The dollar-yen exchange rate is the most important macroeconomic indicator,” he asserts. Hayes revisits his earlier proposal for the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to engage in extensive dollar-for-yen swaps with the Bank of Japan (BOJ), a move he argues would empower the Japanese Ministry of Finance to bolster the yen through targeted interventions in the forex markets. Despite the theoretical benefits of this strategy, Hayes notes with a mix of irony and frustration that the G7 nations, which he refers to as the “Group of Fools,” have opted for a different route. Related Reading: GMX Soars 20% Amid Crypto Whale Frenzy, Is It Back In ‘Turbo Mode’? The narrative then shifts to a critical examination of the G7’s central banking strategies. Hayes points out the stark discrepancies in interest rates among the major economies, with Japan maintaining a near-zero rate while other nations hover around 4-5%. He critiques the conventional wisdom that supports rate cuts as a tool to manage inflation, which universally targets a 2% rate among G7 countries, despite their diverse economic conditions. “The G7 central banks—with the exception of the BOJ—have all raised rates aggressively in response to inflation spikes,” Hayes writes. However, he highlights yesterday’s unexpected rate cuts by the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank despite prevailing inflation trends, suggesting a deeper, unstated economic strategy aimed at bolstering the yen against a backdrop of geopolitical and economic tensions with China. He describes this move as a cessation of what he terms “rate hike Kabuki theatre,” a maneuver he believes is designed to maintain the dominance of the Pax Americana-led global financial system. Why The Bitcoin And Crypto Bull Run Returns It is in this context that Hayes pivots to the implications for the crypto market. Looking ahead, Hayes turns his gaze to the crypto markets, suggesting that these recent shifts signal a fortuitous environment for investment in digital assets. Hayes speculates that the coordinated actions of central banks to adjust interest rates downward, despite high inflation, are setting the stage for increased liquidity in global markets, which traditionally benefits riskier assets like Bitcoin and subsequently altcoins. Related Reading: Fake Crypto Airdrop: Tether’s CEO Warns Of Ongoing Supply Chain Email Exploit “The June central banking fireworks kicked off this week by the BOC and ECB rate cuts will catapult crypto out of the northern hemispheric summer doldrums. This was not my expected base case. I thought the fireworks would start in August, right around when the Fed hosts its Jackson Hole symposium,” Hayes noted. He argues that these monetary policy shifts are likely to ignite a bull market in Bitcoin and crypto, particularly as central banks appear to be entering a cycle of rate easing. “We know how to play this game. It’s the same game we have been playing since 2009 when our Lord and Saviour Satoshi gave us the weapon to defeat the TradFi devil. Go long Bitcoin and subsequently shitcoins.” Hayes declares, referencing the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. As the G7 meeting from June 13-15 looms, Hayes anticipates further developments that could influence global financial markets. He expects the communiqué from this gathering will likely address currency and bond market manipulations explicitly, or at least signal continued accommodative policies. Additionally, Hayes forecasts that despite conventional caution against policy shifts near major political events like the US presidential election, unusual circumstances might prompt unexpected moves. Hayes concludes his essay by reinforcing his bullish stance on Bitcoin and crypto, driven by his analysis of G7 monetary policies and their impact on global exchange rates and financial stability. His call to action for the crypto community is to capitalize on these developments, positioning themselves for what he predicts will be a lucrative phase in the markets. “For my excess liquid crypto synthetic-dollar cash, it is time to deploy it again on conviction shitcoins. […] But suffice it to say, the crypto bull is reawakening and is about to gore the hides of profligate central bankers,” Hayes concludes. At press time, BTC traded at $71,200.

42417993,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcBVF,1717744210,Bitcoin’s Latest Rally to $71K Is Different From the March Breakout. Here's Why.,"The latest breakout is characterized by a lack of speculative froth as opposed to March.  Renewed rate cuts by G-7 central banks and oil price slide favor risk assets.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} has surged back above the significant threshold of $70,000, setting its sights on retesting the record highs it achieved in March. This recent upswing above the said level appears positively distinct from the one seen three months ago. Let’s delve into the reasons why.  Less froth  A frothy market, often a precursor to a price correction, is characterized by a leveraged speculative frenzy. So far, perpetual futures tied to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies show no such signs.  While open interest-weighted funding rates continue to hover above zero, they are well below the highs seen in March, according to data source Coingecko.  In other words, bullish long positions are dominant and bulls are willing to pay bears to keep their positions open. However, the market is less heated than in March. Exchanges collect funding rates every eight hours.  The lack of speculative froth means the latest breakout above $70,000 could be longer-lasting than in March. Funding rates in other large-cap cryptocurrencies tell the same story.  The chart by Velo Data shows funding rates in large-cap coins, including BTC, currently hover in the green zone, representing the annualized 10% to 20% range. Funding rates over 100% represented the overheated category marked by red bars.  At press time, the annualized three-month futures basis (premium) in bitcoin on major offshore exchanges like Binance, OKX, and Deribit ranged between 10% and 13%, significantly below March highs above 25%, per Velo Data. The measured rise in the premium also suggests the absence of speculative fervor.  ""Looking at the current market positioning, I don’t think things are anywhere frothy like they were in late March/early April,"" Greg Magadini, Director of Derivatives at Amberdata, said in a weekly newsletter.  ""We can clearly see that the futures basis is much lower than around peak positioning and the underlying OI buildup is rather stable for BTC,"" Magdini added.  Positive macro  The present macroeconomic environment appears more supportive of risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, than in March.  Per Bloomberg, investment banking giants like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut the benchmark borrowing cost by 25 basis points to the 5% to 5.25% range next month, pivoting toward renewed liquidity easing. The Fed fund futures show traders pricing rate cuts in the year's final quarter.  The European Central Bank and Bank of Canada have already pulled the trigger.  The bias for rate cuts starkly contradicts the situation in March when traders feared resurgent inflation would force the U.S. central bank to resume rate hikes.  The recent swoon in oil prices is also supportive of bitcoin, according to the newsletter service LondonCryptoClub.  The per barrel price for the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude has dropped by over 13% to $75.50 in one month, signaling disinflation and putting downward pressure on government bond yields. The decline in yields, the so-called risk-free rates, is said to incentivize risk-taking in financial markets.  ""Oil is now 12% off its highs and up just 7% YTD. It’s hard to play a 'reflation' narrative with oil falling, and lower oil typically pulls 10-year inflation expectations lower, which in turn pulls 10-year U.S. yields lower…which in turn can help push bitcoin higher indeed,"" founders of LondonCryptoClub said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/07/bitcoins-latest-rally-to-71k-is-different-from-the-march-breakout-heres-why,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d10d0a0ce231eb2031b54a2c9dd5f955b128a18-3992x2242.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The surge in open interest coincides with record inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs and a bullish long-short ratio, indicating positive market sentiment and expectations for bitcoin to reach new all-time highs in the coming weeks.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} traders have now placed the highest-ever positions on BTC-tracked futures in the asset’s history as open interest crept over $37.7 billion late on Thursday, setting a new record.  This eclipsed a previous peak of just under $37 billion in mid-March when bitcoin recorded fresh highs of $73,700.  The jump came as spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) set an inflow record over 18 days, The Block reported. BlackRock’s IBIT took on $340 million in net inflows on Thursday, preliminary data tracked by SoSovalue shows, while Ark Invest’s ARKB saw net outflows of nearly $97 million.  Over $5 billion in open interest has been added since Monday, Coinglass data shows, while BTC prices have risen from the $68,500 level to $71,000 in the period. Of the $37.7 billion, traditional finance powerhouse Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) holds the highest bets at $11 billion, followed by crypto exchange Binance at $8 billion.  The significant long-short ratio shows a bias toward bullish sentiment. Data shows the ratio rose over 1 early Friday from Thursday’s 0.94 level.  A ratio above 1 means that there are more long positions than short positions, suggesting positive market sentiment for an asset. On the other hand, a ratio below 1 suggests that short positions outnumber long positions, indicating negative expectations.  As such, several traders expect bitcoin to rise further in the coming weeks, citing growing risk appetite and favorable regulatory expectations.  “Bitcoin can overcome the resistance level in the zone of 71k-73k and renew all-time highs in the following weeks, driven by optimism in financial markets,” crypto exchange YouHodler’s chief of markets Ruslan Lienka told CoinDesk in a Friday email. “Such positive sentiment is caused by expectations of coming interest rate cuts in the US and Europe that stimulate capital inflow into risk assets.”  “Elevated trading activity with meme stocks such as GameStop and other penny stocks with low ratings shows a growing risk appetite,’ Lienka added.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/07/bitcoin-bets-hit-peak-of-37b-as-etf-inflows-set-new-record,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7daeb4c3c1b6dc96747b63f0b6a6486d839da9f6-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The report predicts that Ethereum could reach a valuation of $2.2 trillion by 2030, translating to a price of around $22,000 per coin. This ambitious prediction hinges on Ethereum’s dominance in the smart contracts arena and its potential to generate a staggering $66 billion in free cash flow by the end of the decade. Related Reading: Beyond BTC: Crypto Miners Get Brainy, Embrace AI After Block Reward Whacking Traditional Finance Embraces Ethereum With ETF Approval A key driver behind VanEck’s bullish outlook is the recent approval of spot Ether ETFs on US stock exchanges. These ETFs allow traditional financial institutions and investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without the complexities of directly holding the cryptocurrency. This increased accessibility has broadened Ethereum’s appeal, attracting financial advisors, institutional investors, and even Big Tech firms. The influx of these new players has bolstered Ethereum’s legitimacy and instilled confidence in its long-term potential. A Network Powerhouse With Room For Growth The Ethereum network boasts a robust user base, processing around $4 trillion worth of transactions and facilitating $5.5 trillion in stablecoin transfers over the past year. This impressive activity highlights Ethereum’s position as a vital cog in the decentralized finance (DeFi) machine. VanEck’s analysis factors in Ethereum’s ongoing evolution, including the rising adoption of applications built on its platform, the increasing scarcity of ETH tokens due to burning mechanisms, and its potential to capture a larger share of the burgeoning blockchain market. The report estimates the total addressable market (TAM) for blockchain applications to be a staggering $15 trillion, indicating vast room for Ethereum’s growth. Will Ethereum Become The Silicon Valley Of Blockchain? VanEck’s analysis paints a picture of Ethereum as a potential “Silicon Valley of Blockchain,” a platform that fosters innovation and disrupts traditional industries. The ability to build and deploy smart contracts on Ethereum empowers developers to create new applications and financial instruments that could revolutionize sectors like supply chain management, identity verification, and even voting systems. As Ethereum’s ecosystem flourishes, the value proposition of holding ETH tokens strengthens, potentially fueling the predicted price surge. Related Reading: Altcoins: Analyzing Key Signs For A Potential Boom – Or Bust Ether Price Prediction Meanwhile, according to the latest forecast, Ether is expected to rise by 2.13%, reaching $3,861 by July 6, 2024.

The overall market sentiment for Ethereum is optimistic, with a Fear & Greed Index reading of 78, indicating “Extreme Greed.” This index measures market emotions and sentiment from various sources, and a high level like this often signals that investors are becoming overly confident, which can sometimes precede a market correction. In terms of recent performance, Ethereum has experienced 17 green days out of the last 30, translating to a 57% rate of positive daily performance. This indicates a generally upward trend with consistent gains. However, over the past 30 days, Ethereum has shown an 11.30% volatility rate. This level of volatility is relatively high, implying that while the price is expected to rise, it could experience significant fluctuations.

Dive into the protocol’s key metrics and observe notable levels to gain insights into potential price movements and actions for the MKR token in the near term. Maker Protocol’s Updated Metrics Reveal Positive Growth The Maker protocol, known for its decentralized stablecoin DAI, recently disclosed updated metrics highlighting its health and growth over the past month in a post on social media site X (formerly Twitter). DAI, governed by MakerDAO’s decentralized blockchain, enables the borrowing and lending of cryptocurrencies. The current DAI supply, exceeding 5 billion DAI, is a critical metric reflecting the total amount of DAI created and circulating. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whale Enter Buying Frenzy, 715 Billion SHIB Snapped Up In Days Total Value Locked represents the dollar value of assets locked within the Maker Protocol. Despite being live on one chain since its inception, Maker has approximately $8.76 billion locked, making it the fourth-largest decentralized finance (DeFi protocol). The Maker Protocol allows the minting of DAI by depositing accepted assets into Maker Vaults. The ETH-C Vault type holds the largest share, with approximately $2.07 billion worth of ETH locked. The system surplus needs to reach 50 million DAI to achieve a complete MKR burn. On the other hand, the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) represents the rate at which the Maker Protocol rewards users for locking their DAI within DSR contracts. Currently, the DSR cost amounts to approximately 153 million DAI. Currently, the protocol notes that most DAI remains within DeFi, with externally owned Accounts (EOA) and the DSR serving as the top use cases, holding over 2.3 billion and 1.96 billion DAI, respectively. In terms of revenue generation, SparkLend D3M and Spark’s MetaMorpho D3M lead the way, generating an estimated $155 million in annual revenue based on their deposit APYs. This highlights the significance of various collateral types and revenue streams within the Maker ecosystem. Potential Catalyst For MKR’s Price? Despite the growth and investor interest in the Maker ecosystem, the upcoming Endgame Plan, a proposal to revamp its governance and tokenomics, is expected to act as a catalyst for the MKR token, potentially boosting its price. The proposal aims to establish a self-sustainable equilibrium called the Endgame State, envisioning a resilient ecosystem where Maker Core’s scope and complexity will no longer change. Related Reading: Bitcoin Approaching All-Time Highs: Why Is Retail Interest Rapidly Declining? Currently, MKR is trading at $2,612, experiencing a slight decline of over 2% in the past 24 hours and around 8% in the last 30 days. CoinGecko data also indicates a recent 4.7% decrease in trading volume, totaling only $72 million compared to the token’s $2.4 billion market cap. If the Endgame plan indeed generates renewed interest in the token and acts as a catalyst for MKR, the next significant obstacles to monitor in the short term are situated around the $2,660 level, which has impeded the token’s ability to surpass higher levels in the past few days. Additionally, on its potential path to reclaim the $3,000 milestone, resistance levels at $2,710 and $2,760 would need to be overcome before potentially retesting the resistance at $2,845. Moving forward, on the MKR/USD daily chart, the levels at $2,905 and $2,950 act as the final hurdles before reaching the $3,000 milestone. It remains to be seen whether further developments and growth in key metrics, coupled with the anticipated Endgame proposal, can stimulate a significant bullish momentum for MKR, enabling it to overcome resistance levels and regain its bullish trend.

42417976,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTcBFl,1717725568,"Former Federal Prosecutors, Agents Ask U.S. Sec. Blinken to ‘Step Up’ Efforts to Secure Detained Binance Exec’s Release","A group of 108 former federal prosecutors and agents have signed a public letter to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urging the State Department to “step up” its efforts to secure Binance compliance head Tigran Gambaryan’s release from a Nigerian prison, Axios reported Thursday evening.  The letter, reportedly spearheaded by investor and Coinbase board member Katie Haun – a former federal prosecutor – called the government’s minimal efforts to intervene on Gambaryan’s behalf “wholly lacking,” stressing that the “consequences of further inaction are potentially dire.”  Gambaryan, a former Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agent and Binance’s current head of financial crime compliance, was arrested in Nigeria in February and, a month later, charged with money laundering and tax evasion – essentially as a scapegoat for his employer, which Nigerian officials have accused of tanking the value of the naira. Gambaryan has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Bail hearings and other court proceedings have repeatedly been pushed back.  A State Department spokesperson told CoinDesk earlier this year that the department was ""aware of reports"" of Gambaryan's detention, while a White House spokesperson later referred CoinDesk back to the State Department.  During court proceedings last month, Gambaryan collapsed. A spokesperson for the family told CoinDesk that Gambaryan is suspected of having malaria and a severe throat infection, presumably picked up in the prison where he is being held.  Despite a court order to move him to a hospital from Kuje prison – known to hold violent criminals and terrorists, including members of the Islamist jihadist group Boko Haram – Nigerian officials have reportedly refused to transfer him. In their letter to Sec. Blinken, Haun and the other signers call Gambaryan’s captivity “not only unjust but inhumane,” adding that, in addition to not receiving adequate medical care, he has not been allowed to speak with his lawyers or family.  “We implore you to leverage the full power of U.S. diplomacy to do the just thing by demanding and securing Tigran's immediate release back to his family and the country he has so honorably served,” the authors of the letter wrote.  Earlier this week, 16 members of Congress wrote a similar letter to U.S. President Joe Biden, Sec. Blinken and diplomat Roger Carstens, the State Department’s special envoy for hostage affairs.  The letter called Gambaryan’s detainment “deeply disturbing” and urged that his case be transferred to Carstens’ office to be treated as a hostage situation.  “We fear for his life,” they said. “Immediate action is essential to ensure his safety and preserve his life. We must act swiftly before it is too late.”  Read more: Opinion – The U.S. Response to Binance Exec Tigran Gambaryan's Detention Is Shameful",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/06/07/former-federal-prosecutors-agents-ask-us-sec-blinken-to-step-up-efforts-to-secure-detained-binance-execs-release,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/581a58673d7527a6b8051c010843d9069d2a2983-4454x2506.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While the meme coin’s open interest is yet to break its Match 2024 all-time high, it is on a bullish trend that could see an attempt soon. Shiba Inu Open Interest At February Levels The total Shiba Inu open interest has climbed back above $97 million across multiple exchanges, bringing it to one of the highest levels so far for the year. According to data from Coinglass, the SHIB open interest is now sitting at $97.08 million as of June 6, 2024. Related Reading: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana Over 150% Annual Gains Leave The Stock Market, Gold In The Dust This figure is notable because the open interest has been struggling over the last few months. After hitting an all-time high of almost $136 million in March 2024, the Shiba Inu open interest fell rapidly, losing more than half of its value by mid-April. However, the SHIB open interest began to recover in May, and with June rolling around, the open interest has surged. From the March lows to the currently June figures, the Shiba Inu open interest is now up almost 100%, showing a notable spike in interest from investors. Currently sitting above 97%, the SHIB open interest is now around 60% away from making a new all-time high. The possibility of this happening has significant implications for the SHIB price hitting a new all-time high as well. Why A Rise In Open Interest Is Important The Shiba Inu open interest is on the rise is significant not just to measure investor interest but in how it affects the SHIB price. Looking at the March figures when the SHIB open interest had hit a new all-time high, the price had rallied right alongside it. So the current increase could translate into a price rally as well.

If the open interest were to go back to its $136 million ATH, going by how much the price rose the last time, it could see the Shiba Inu price touch $0.00004 once more, and hit a new yearly high. This is because in March, the SHIB price more than doubled when the open interest surged. However, in the last 24 hours, there has been a small slow down in the open interest, with an overall 0.42% decrease.
