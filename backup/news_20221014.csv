They are an offshoot of the meme coin trend that saw various cryptocurrencies rally positively and now, these fan tokens have begun a trend of their own. The year 2022 is almost at its end but there are still good reasons why these fan tokens are a good thing to keep an eye on. Why Football Fan Tokens? Football fan tokens have taken the crypto market by storm over the past year. Coins like the Manchester City Fan Token and the Santos FC Fan Token have performed tremendously well, exceeding all expectations. But even though they have already grown so much, there may be more upside for these fan tokens. Related Reading: Why Crypto Market Sentiment May Present A Unique Buying Opportunity One of the major reasons behind the renewed interest in fan tokens is the upcoming FIFA World Cup. This is argued by some to be the biggest sports competition in the world where the official football clubs of different countries compete for the title. A large portion of the world&apos;s population also tunes in for the competition. The FIFA World Cup 2018 held in Russia saw a total of 3.5 billion viewers around the world, and this year&apos;s edition of the competition held in Qatar is expected to draw in an estimated 5 billion viewers.

42416073,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuYF4J,1665786267,CFTC’s Behnam Calls FTX Idea a Potential ‘Evolution’ in Market Structure,"FTX’s proposal to cut out the middlemen in U.S. crypto derivatives has shaken traditional financial firms, but the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said the idea could mark an “evolution” in the way markets work.  CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam said he couldn’t comment on when the agency may respond to the crypto exchange unit’s proposal, nor which way it might lean, but he revealed how impressed he is with the idea on Friday at the Financial Markets Quality Conference at Georgetown University.  “This is a unique intersection of the crypto space and traditional finance,” Behnam said. “I think this is potentially – and I emphasize the ‘potential’ – another phase in the evolution of market structure, innovation and disruption.”  FTX’s U.S. derivatives operation applied for the ability to clear customers’ margin-backed derivatives contracts directly without traditional intermediaries. Earlier this year, the CFTC held a roundtable talk at which derivatives industry leaders balked at the proposal as dangerous, saying it could spark flash crashes from automatically liquidating customers’ positions without human intervention.  “Non-intermediated futures would be a significant deal; it’s a significant shift,” Behnam said. He went on to describe how crypto natives come into the long-established industry and are surprised by what they find.  “They come into the traditional market space and they’re just a bit puzzled,” he said. “They’re like, ‘Why do you do it this way? We have a way that’s more efficient, where we can have trading execution that’s quicker with better pricing, and we can have settlement and custody in a much better manner.’ That’s where I think we have to learn from each other collectively.”  Behnam equated it with the commodities industry’s 1990s shift from floor trading to the computerized system.  The application process seems to be “going well,” so far, said Zach Dexter, the CEO of FTX US Derivatives, at a separate event on Friday – the Security Traders Association market structure conference. FTX had seen the existing market as “a difficult system to deal with for retail investors” to trade crypto futures, and Dexter said the proposal is “fixing all of that.”  His company is now “walking the agency through” the application “in an incredible amount of detail,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/14/cftcs-behnam-calls-ftx-idea-a-potential-evolution-in-market-structure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eda58d6f0707fc5aa4ffc0efbc2217e61f36e569-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Despite the elevated reading, Bitcoin rallied anyway.Bitcoin&apos;s price trend over the last month has been far more similar to Gold than to equities.I believe the Fed will pivot from hiking rates and potentially even start buying US debt again sooner than most.Bitcoin will account for it.Yesterday, the BLS released the latest consumer price inflation readings and it wasn&apos;t pretty. Headline CPI came in at 8.2% year over year with core CPI at 6.6%. Each of these figures exceeded expectations.

That selloff was the market seemingly coming to grips with the idea that the Fed couldn&apos;t justify a rate hike pivot at the last FOMC meeting.

42416079,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuYFJP,1665782632,Here Are the Most Expensive NFTs Bought by Celebs – and What They're Worth Today,"In April 2021, Paris Hilton released her first non-fungible token (NFT), telling CoinDesk at the time that NFTs had “literally taken over my entire mind and soul.” While Hilton says she actually began investing in cryptocurrency as early 2016, she really made a splash by being one of several celebrities who publicly “aped in” during the hype of 2021.  But times are different now. Since the start of 2022, ether’s price has plunged 60%, and NFT trading volume has decreased 88% since the third quarter of 2021, according to a report from Alchemy. As the bear market roars on and hype around NFTs has died down, CoinDesk wondered, what are the NFTs that celebrities bought worth now?  We took a look at what celebrities paid for NFTs at the time, according to rankings from crypto data aggregator CoinGecko, and what they would be worth now if they sold for the exact same amount of ether (ETH) today.  1. Snoop Dogg  In December 2021, rapper and music producer Snoop Dogg purchased digital artist XCOPY’s work, Right Click and Save As guy.  Snoop purchased the original NFT for 1,600 ETH, or $7,088,229 at the time. With Ethereum’s drop in value, that same amount of ETH would be worth $2,083,456 — less than two-thirds its original value.  Snoop’s growing interest in NFTs and Web3 has been noteworthy over the past couple years. In February 2022, Snoop Dogg shared his plans to turn Death Row Records into an NFT music label, releasing a collection of NFT songs on OpenSea weeks later.  2. Gary Vee  Entrepreneur and NFT influencer Gary Vaynerchuk (commonly known as Gary Vee) purchased CryptoPunk #2140 for 1,600 ETH – which was $3,953,216 in July 2021.  Snoop and Vaynerchuck paid the same amount of ETH for their tokens; however, Vaynerchuck got a better deal than Snoop by buying his token five months earlier. The price today for their NFTs would be the same for both men: $2,083,456.  Vaynerchuck, the entrepreneur who founded restaurant reservation platform Resy, owns over 7,000 NFTs according to a press release. He’s not only a collector but also a builder in the Web3 space. In May 2021, he launched an NFT collection called VeeFriends on OpenSea, and this past May he filed a trademark for Vayner3, his own NFT consulting firm.  3. Justin Bieber  Pop singer Justin Bieber is next up with his purchase of Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) #3001, which he bought in January 2022 for $1,301,550, or 500 ETH. Justin caused speculation on Instagram after he posted the photo of the ape without confirming he bought it.  Had Bieber purchased this NFT today, it would have cost $651,080.  4. Steve Aoki  Steve Aoki, DJ and music producer, purchased Doodle #2238 for 269.69 ETH, or $862,056, in January 2022.  If Aoki bought his Doodle today, it would have cost him $351,179 – less than half the original amount of his purchase.  Aoki has been an advocate for the growing Web3 space. Last April, he released Sci-Fi NFTs on NFT platform Nifty Gateway, and secured funding to create an NFT tv show in August 2022.  5. Logan Paul  Infamous YouTuber-turned-WWE-fighter Logan Paul purchased K4M-1 #03 from the 0N1 Force Collection. Paul purchased this NFT for 188 ETH in February 2021 for $624,669, which would be $244,806 today.  However, this “Bumblebee NFT” has been in the news as a tweet claiming it was worth just $10 today went viral. When decentralized application data site DappRadar dug into the data, it estimated the token to be worth 8.12 ETH, or about $10,516, in reality.  Paul’s early steps into the NFT space allowed him to ape into collections at the start of the days of the hype. He currently holds several CryptoPunks, World of Women NFTs, as well as a Bored Ape in two accounts on OpenSea.  6. Neymar Jr.  Neymar Jr., the Brazilian football player for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), bought BAYC #5269 in January 2022 for 186.69 ETH, which was $569,531 at the time. If he bought the NFT today it would be worth $247,007.  Neymar purchased BAYC #6633 the same day, paying a total of $1.05 million for the pair.  While he made the token his profile picture for a moment amid the hype, his roots in cryptocurrency go deeper. In 2018, his soccer club made plans to create a social token with European blockchain company Socios, which has also partnered with Barcelona, Juventus, Atletico Madrid and Manchester City.  7. Marshmello  DJ and music producer Marshmello bought CryptoPunk #8274 in October 2021 for $504,069, or 130 ETH. Today, that would be $169,280.  Marshmello purchased other tokens previously, including BAYC #4808, which he purchased in September 2021 and sold the following December for a $180,000 profit. According to his wallet on OpenSea, the artist still owns CryptoPunk #8274, and also possess BAYC #9231, and several CrypToadz among other tokens.  8. Madonna  “Queen of Pop” Madonna also aped into the NFT hype, buying BAYC #4988 for 180 ETH in March 2022.  At the time of her purchase, she paid $466,461. Today, it’s worth $234,388.  While Madonna purchased her NFT near the end of the hype period, she launched an NFT collection with artist Beeple in May called “Mother of Creation,” which, as usual for Madonna, sparked some controversy.  9. Eminem  Rapper Eminem purchased BAYC #9055 for 123.45 ETH, which in December cost him $453,776. Now, the token would cost him $160,757.  Twitter user @Gee_Gazza, the original owner of the token, tweeted out his gratitude for the rapper purchasing his token, asking to write a lyric in his next song. Since Pete Davidson’s ""Saturday Night Live"" skit explaining NFTs in the style of Eminem, the rapper has released a collection called SHADYCON on NFT platform Nifty Gateway, with works inspired by the artist’s childhood and passion for collectibles.  10. Tom Brady  Quarterback Tom Brady completes the list with his purchase of BAYC #3667 in April 2022.  At the time, he paid 133 ETH, or $453,062. Now, that’s about $173,187.  The legendary football player has made major plays into the Web3 space, co-founding NFT company Autograph and releasing his own collections there.

42416089,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuYG2h,1665782139,CFTC Commissioner to Pitch Retail Investor Definition to Get Set for Crypto,"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) needs to redefine how it sets rules for retail investors now that the agency seems likely to take on oversight of spot crypto trading, said Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero.  She intends to propose a new retail investor definition, she said Friday in an interview with CoinDesk. Goldsmith Romero, who holds one of the Democratic seats on the five-member commission, said she’ll start with an informal concept posted on the agency’s website, asking for people to weigh in.  ""We've got more retail investors coming into our markets that traditionally had been largely institutional,"" she said.  The current way the CFTC thinks of retail investors is “so wide,” she said, and “includes just regular people all the way up to somebody with $10 million.”  Adding a newly defined category could help the agency treat regular crypto users differently under the rules than the large institutions, and that would typically mean more limits and protections for the small-scale investors.  “You want to make sure that you can provide expanded access to retail investors but in a way that's safe and affordable for them, which might look very different than how the institutions or how a high net worth individual might purchase,"" Goldsmith Romero said.  The CFTC is so far looking most likely to be the primary regulator for crypto trading, according to various bills winding through Congress that would give it authority over the spot market – or the markets in which the actual tokens trade between investors. A consensus has begun developing among lawmakers from both parties to saddle the U.S. commodities agency with a new power to oversee spot markets for digital assets that aren’t securities, including bitcoin.  Goldsmith Romero, who is the lead commissioner for the agency’s technology advisory committee, suggested that a new retail definition could be employed if the agency is weighing rules – for instance – on the use of leverage by investors. Establishing a retail-investor category could set aside “household” investors from the pros, she said, and could give them “more consumer protections, maybe more disclosures, written in a way that regular people understand.""  The CFTC’s sister agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission, has long maintained a shifting definition of what makes an “accredited investor” who isn’t thought to need as many protections as mom-and-pop investors. That threshold is currently at $1 million in net worth or $200,000 a year in individual income.  Goldsmith Romero said she’d like to hear from people with ideas or who don’t agree with her push.  ""I'm happy to listen to all of that to try to get it right,” she said. “I'm just throwing out a concept of something that I think is not quite set up right. … Our definition of retail really doesn’t work for this asset class.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/10/14/cftc-commissioner-to-pitch-retail-investor-definition-to-get-set-for-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/89f5a8aed22c15c200cb3d202c7f90962ca5387e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42416093,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuYGRr,1665780807,Market Wrap: Crypto Markets Take Quieter Ride Following Thursday’s Roller Coaster,"Price Action  A week highlighted by the release of a disappointing inflation report and other discouraging economic indicators ultimately did little to stir bitcoin from its narrow price range of the past few weeks.  Daily trading volume for the largest crypto by market capitalization has trailed its 20-day moving average for nine of the last 10 trading days. The exception occurred on Thursday, largely driven by market reaction to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report.  Bitcoin (BTC) was recently trading at about $19,300, roughly flat over the previous 24 hours and about where it stood at the beginning of the week. With a few brief exceptions, BTC has traded largely between $19,000 and $21,000 for the past month and remains close to 60% down from its price at the start of the year.  Ether (ETH) was recently changing hands a little above $1,300, up more than 2% from Thursday, about where it started the week. ETH is down 23% since the Sept. 15 conversion of the Ethereum network from a proof-of-work consensus to the more energy efficient proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, and off 64% since the start of 2022.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, is down -0.23%.  The top altcoin gainers recently were Alchemy Pay’s ACH token and SushiSwap’s SUSHI, which rose 39% and 15%, respectively, while NuCypher’s NU had the toughest day, declining 24.4%  Macro View  Financial market participants were scrutinizing Thursday’s inflation report, which showed September prices rose 8.2% year over year versus expectations of 8.1%. Markets reacted negatively initially before regaining lost ground to end the day slightly higher.  U.S retail spending was unchanged for September versus expectations for a 0.2% increase. The unexpectedly low figure reflected lower demand, a result of rising costs.  In traditional financial markets, U.S. equities' seven-day performance was mixed, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite declined 1% and 2.7%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) finished the week up 1.5%.

Technical Take  BTC and ETH Trade Quietly After Thursday’s Roller-Coaster Ride  Price action for the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization was quiet on Friday, as both ended the traditional U.S. trading day relatively flat.  Following an expansion of trading activity on Thursday, bitcoin volume retreated below its 20-day moving average on Friday, continuing a theme of recent weeks. A similar pattern has occurred with ETH, though Friday volume on ETH was close to its average.  BTC’s Bollinger Bands shows that bitcoin is trading just below its 20-day moving average for price, while volatility has remained relatively stable.  Bollinger Bands are a technical indicator that plots an asset’s average prices, and calculates two standard deviations above and below the average.  Statistically, an asset’s price stays within two standard deviations of its average 95% of the time. A widening of Bollinger Bands indicates an increase in volatility, while a narrowing of bands indicates the opposite.  Since Oct. 3, the upper and lower bands for BTC have narrowed, highlighting bitcoin’s recent propensity to trade flat.  BTC touched the upper range of its Bollinger Bands Oct. 3-5 before retreating below the mean briefly. The opposite occurred on Oct. 13, as prices initially reacted poorly to CPI data before reverting.  Today, BTC made a brief attempt to surpass $20,000 during the 12:00 UTC (8:00 a.m. ET) hour, but was met with resistance and declined to current levels throughout the remainder of the day.

42416094,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuYGHn,1665780335,Crypto Market Maker Wintermute Pays Off $96M TrueFi Debt Weeks After Being Hacked,"Prominent crypto market maker Wintermute paid off its $96 million debt on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol TrueFi, TrueFi’s loan dashboard shows, just about three weeks after being hacked for $160 million.  The TrueFi loan was one of the firm's largest outstanding known debts owed to a DeFi lending platform. Wintermute took out a $92 million loan on the TrueFi protocol from its USDT lending pool in April, which was due to mature Oct. 15.  Wintermute repaid the loan with interest Friday, one day before the deadline, transaction data on blockchain data platform Nansen shows.  The loan was uncollateralized, meaning that the borrower didn’t pledge any assets against the loan, securing it only by its financial standing and reputation. Market makers and trading firms often take out these types of loans for trading purposes.  The news comes after Wintermute's DeFi operation suffered a $160 million hack in late September, one of the largest hacks in recent months. At the time, Wintermute’s outstanding DeFi debt amounted to $200 million, CoinDesk reported earlier. Evgeny Gaevoy, the firm’s CEO, said then the company remained solvent after the hack.  Earlier this week, Blockwater, a Korean trading firm, defaulted on a loan on TrueFi after missing payment on a $3.4 million loan. TrueFi said that it determined “a potential court-supervised administrative proceeding would lead to a better outcome” to recover the assets to lenders.

42411331,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNDst,1665780185,Blockchain Bridges Keep Getting Attacked. Here's How to Prevent It,"Cross-chain bridges make interoperability within the blockchain sphere possible. They enable protocols to communicate with one another, share data and build exciting new use cases that are helping propel Web3 into new frontiers. But as this month’s BNB Smart Chain exploit reminds us, they are vulnerable to attack.  If we are to harness the potential of what bridges offer, we need to learn how to protect them.  Bridges have rightly earned a reputation as Web3’s weak link after a string of exploits this year. Just as robbers prefer to target assets while they are transported in vans (as opposed to being locked in bank vaults with sophisticated security systems), hackers have realized tokens in transit are similarly vulnerable.  Coby Moran is the lead investigator at Merkle Science, a predictive Web3 risk and intelligence platform. He previously served as an analyst for the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.  They also know substantial funds are crossing these intersections. With total assets estimated at more than $54 billion, decentralized finance (DeFi) presents an especially attractive target. Even before the BNB attack, crypto bridges featured in more than $1.6 billion of the $2 billion stolen from DeFi protocols in 2022. The magnitude and regularity of these exploits demonstrates why fallen bridges are gaining notoriety.  February: Wormhole – $375 million  March: Ronin Bridge – $624 million  August: Nomad Bridge – $190 million  September: Wintermute – $160 million  From my experience leading analysts on the trail of stolen funds (like in the recent Wintermute exploit), it’s clear that prevention and defense are where the blockchain community should be focusing its collective efforts.  See also: Calling a Hack an Exploit Minimizes Human Error | Opinion  The Federal Bureau of Investigation has warned investors that cybercriminals are taking advantage of “the complexity of cross-chain functionality.” This certainly aligns with current narratives that bridges are not just vulnerable, but vulnerabilities.  But there are ways we can prevent exploits. As a former FBI analyst with time on the cybercrime task force in Washington, D.C., I can say exploits are rarely fiendishly clever or sophisticated (the type you might see in a Hollywood movie). Rather, they're often predictable security breaches.  Sticking to the world of bridges, which are normally exploited following the introduction of code bugs or leaked cryptographic keys, are often reasonably sophisticated but foreseeable. Take exploits such as these:  False deposits: Bridgesmonitor for deposit events on one blockchain to initiate a transfer to another. If a bad actor is able to generate a deposit event without making a real deposit, or makes a deposit with a valueless token, they can withdraw value from the bridge on the other side. TheQubit Finance raid in January is a good example, tricking the protocol into thinking attackers had deposited money when they had not.  Validator flaws: Bridgesalso carry out deposit validation before permitting transfers. Hackers may try to create fake deposits capable of defeating this process. This happened in the Wormhole hack, where a flaw in the digital signature validation was exploited. Technically, this was an example of a familiar smart contract exploit. But, as we’re learning, if it happens on a bridge then the bridge gets blamed.  Validator takeover: This scenario relies on taking over a certain number of validators originally set up to vote yes or no on a cryptocurrency transfer. By controlling a majority of the votes, the attacker can approve any transfers. In the Ronin Network hack, for example, five of the bridge’s nine validators had been compromised in this way.  As these examples suggest, focusing on the shortcomings of bridges while failing to address ground-level security measures is not the way forward. Bridges per se are not the problem; technology is, after all, agnostic. The most common factor across exploits is human error. Post-hack investigations and subsequent fixes often serve to highlight our age-old tendency to close the barn door only after a horse has bolted.  Human problems  When conducting investigations we often talk things through with a project's team members – because, often, they're the target of exploits. Hackers rarely do anything totally new with every exploit, but instead rely on a series of age-old tricks.  Social engineering, or targeting people in order to gain access to privileged accounts, is a classic case in point. People can be befriended and let their guard down or badgered with enough questions that they reveal a secret.  Take the Ronin Bridge, an Ethereum sidechain built for Axie Infinity that enabled users to transfer assets to the Ethereum mainnet. Five of the bridge's nine validator nodes were compromised in a phishing attack. Afterwards, Ronin announced plans to boost this number, tweeting that “the root cause of our attack was the small validator set which made it easier to compromise the network.”  There go those barn doors, closing.  We also see human limitations impacting the ability to create code fit for purpose. An ongoing developer shortage means there are just not enough experts capable of building and analyzing bridges. Looking again at the Wormhole incident, we see it was abetted by a coding glitch that let hackers set up a fraudulent signature set authorizing transactions to mint ether (ETH).  Had that been discovered earlier, this avenue of attack could have been closed down. It goes without saying that Wormhole had lean contributor numbers. (For the inverse here, please note that Ethereum, with its numerous large teams of developers, has so far avoided a major hack.)  See also: Are Blockchain Bridges Safe? Why Bridges Are Targets of Hacks  Bridges are soft targets – central points where large sums are stored without the robust protection – and will continue to be attacked. But we should bear in mind, it’s not just the bridges that are vulnerable; blockchains on both sides are put at risk by poorly guarded connections. It’s time to get educated and audited.  Education:  Consider taking a certified class in blockchain security.  Keep up to date with current affairs in the space.  When an exploit hits the news, do your own research. What can you learn that might benefit your own project?  Auditing:  Ensure new bridge code is audited before release and then tested afterwards.  Increase validator numbers.  Check regularly for false deposit events.  Set up a staff task force to focus on security  Consider using experts to undertake an audit. Ask if they use the latest cross-chain tracking tools.  Offering bug bounties will help you cover more ground.  Ensure smart contract addresses are continuously monitored.  The bottom line is that crypto as a whole takes a reputational and financial hit every time an exploit makes waves. The answer is to learn from the mistakes hackers teach us time and again, becoming more proactive in our efforts to prevent repeat performances.  Bridges are vital pieces of Web3 infrastructure we cannot currently do without. And we need to defend them more effectively.",NEGATIVE,ETH | BNB,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | BNB,Coby Moran,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/14/blockchain-bridges-keep-getting-attacked-heres-how-to-prevent-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/32b9fcb7993c8358fe0f518c6db0b7da1cbc5e6e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Rashida Talib (D-Mich.) and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon last week at a Capitol Hill hearing over whether the U.S. financial sector should continue funding profitable new oil and gas projects. The viral exchange – particularly Dimon's assertion that defunding fossil fuels would be the “road to hell for America” – rallied the usual suspects on both sides of the political aisle ... for a short while, before the next current thing came up.  But the question of government involvement (some would say coercion) in financial decisions won’t soon fade. In fact, the stakes are about to heighten as political interest in central bank digital currencies (CBDC) grows.  Paul H. Jossey is an adjunct fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute and founder of www.thecrowdfundinglawyers.com.  Without doubt, a CBDC could have sinister consequences for the U.S. should the government gain granular insight into Americans’ everyday transactions, potentially directing them to favored public policies.  So-called sustainable finance and its cousin Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) investment standards aim to shape corporate decisions towards an elite consensus on issues like environmental policy and the primacy of racial and gender diversity on corporate boards. Proponents already force shareholder votes on their preferred issues, but they want more.  For example, President Biden’s Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Institutions, Graham Steele, wrote an academic article urging regulators to force drastic action on climate, including ultimately “imposing limitations on an institution’s activities, prohibiting activities, or forcing asset divestiture.” Gary Gensler, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has overseen the implementation of sweeping new corporate climate disclosures. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen describes climate change as an “existential threat” and urges “a rapid transition to a net-zero carbon economy.”  A CBDC would go beyond that kind of politicization of finance, imposing government directives on financial transactions to the individual level, to money itself. CBDCs are direct liabilities of a country’s central bank. Financial authorities tightly monitor and control the notes.  Unsurprisingly, the specter of such control appeals to authoritarians. China, for example, has been working on a CBDC since 2014. When fully implemented it will incorporate seamlessly with the regime’s existing social credit system.  Meanwhile, the global central banking authority, the Bank for International Settlements, is overseeing a number of CBDC pilots and running its own test of CBDCs’ international compatibility. The U.S. is also moving forward, if haltingly. While there are many forms a CBDC can take, it's likely all CBDC transactions will be monitored by some agency or another, with the evergreen justification of stopping money laundering and terrorism.  That anti-money laundering/combating terrorism financing (AML/CFT) regulations rarely stop wrongdoing won’t matter. Western officials will give the usual lip service about privacy, but it’s a mirage. As researcher Natalie Smolenski recently wrote for the Bitcoin Policy Institute, privacy in the CBDC context “does not mean privacy from the state. Rather, the state is presumed to be an essentially good and trustworthy overseer of markets at every scale, including at the level of individual transactions – and a desire for privacy from the state is implicitly equated to criminal intent.”  See also: If Money Is Speech, CBDCs Should Be Tools for Freedom | Opinion  A government with the power to record and monitor everyone’s transactions is powerful enough to impose its own version of morality on those transactions. Curtailing them, banning them, stopping them, erasing them, denying the ability for a company or individual to send or receive funds for disfavored people or causes. Once governments gain this control it will never be returned. There will always be some other existential threat to fight, some new clever money launderers, some other terrorists to stop; peaceful truckers denied a living by empirically dubious public health mandates are just the beginning.  Although the hour is late, it’s not too late to stop the CBDC train. In the U.S., at least, the Federal Reserve has publicly stated it will not move forward without congressional authorization. This provides a political opening. A technological opening may also arise as the slow pace of government may render CBDCs obsolete before they gain purchase. But no one should understate the threat CBDCs pose to individual sovereignty. They represent the final step toward the politicization of money.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Paul Jossey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/14/against-cbdcs-and-the-politicization-of-money,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3b7464d5b7f90a7dab044260e959785c80e1f775-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421228,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhqnt,1665777101,Refound Journalism: Selling NFTs to Help Photojournalists,"It’s no secret that journalism is in trouble and has been for a long time. Thanks largely to online alternatives destroying the markets for print advertising and classified ads, the number of full-time reporters employed in U.S. newsrooms dropped by 26% between 2008 and 2020.  Over the years, several crypto projects have attempted to build sweeping new models for journalism, with little success. But a new project to be presented at CoinDesk’s IDEAS conference next week is taking a more focused, and more promising, approach.  Refound Journalism has one simple core goal: helping photojournalists in conflict or disaster zones build financial support and manage rights by selling non-fungible tokens (NFT) of their work. Cofounder Ahmed Hamid then wants to build other features around that central service, including tools for crowdfunding assignments ahead of time, and for keeping photojournalists safer. The founding team is rounded out by Austin Fleming, Genesis Barrios, and Riley Desrochers.  Refound Journalism is a finalist in CoinDesk's Web3athon. The winners are announced at the I.D.E.A.S. conference October 18 and 19.  With the foreign desks of large news operations shrinking, even major outlets like the Washington Post have much less ability to cover conflict and disasters than they did as little as 10 years ago. That means much more reliance on – and arguably, mistreatment of – freelance journalists to capture the world’s dark corners, whether it’s the war in Ukraine or lesser-known conflicts like the current civil war in Ethiopia.  “People seem to assume that war photographers [and other conflict journalists] get paid more than reporters who work in safer places,” says Hamid. “The truth is, it’s the opposite.”  Larger news organizations have already shown that NFTs can generate significant income for an industry that could definitely use it. Both Time and Fortune (my former employer) have raised substantial sums from the sales of NFTs of both stories and photographs as collectibles. At its core, Refound Journalism aims to make that easier for individual reporters who don’t have the support of huge organizations, while also adding functional contract and licensing elements to the NFTs.  That’s a much more focused and grounded approach than those of previous crypto projects that hoped to save journalism. Refound isn’t trying to create entirely new consumption and funding models for news, as ConsenSys-backed Civil did back in 2018. Nor is it trying to use financial gamification to fight “fake news,” as TruStory did during the same period. Both of those projects have now shuttered, hamstrung by a mix of overreaching ambition and flawed assumptions.  Instead, Refound is focused on a much narrower problem, where crypto and decentralized infrastructure seem to offer clear advantages. Its biggest priority is building an NFT system for ease of use and verification, even under difficult circumstances. Hamid says the Refound system will use metadata embedded by cameras to verify the source of photos, as well as a reputation system for contributors to try and control abuse or fraud.  Refound plans to build its payment rails on the Celo crypto network, which includes features for offline payments – and the cross-border fluidity that is a core advantage of crypto-based payments. The NFTs themselves would be hosted using the decentralized Filecoin cloud storage protocol. Refound also says licensing rights and content usage guidelines would be embedded in the NFTs, which could reduce the complexity of negotiating those agreements from conflict zones.  Further features are planned, all based on feedback from journalists themselves. They include a planned emergency alert system that would allow users to warn one another of particularly dangerous areas. Refound also aims to include funding pools that would help journalists pay for trips ahead of time, potentially including community commissions for specific projects.  “If no one is covering the Rohingya in Myanmar, users [could] commission work,” Hamid offers as an example.  Conflict appears to be rising around the world, at the precise moment when there is waning financial support for reporting on it. Hamid sees Refound Journalism as one step toward addressing that structural failure, and fulfilling what he describes as one of his own deeply-held values: “When the truth needs to be told, it should be told.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIL | MARKET | MINING,David Z.

42416095,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuYGMp,1665776995,Censored Ethereum Blocks Hit the 51% Threshold Over the Past 24 Hours,"The Ethereum blockchain reached a new censorship milestone Friday when 51% of the blocks produced over the last 24 hours followed the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) compliance recommendations.  With that, the majority of the blocks over the past day were delivered by relays that screened out transactions associated with Tornado Cash – a service that mixes transactions to make them anonymous – to comply with OFAC after it banned Americans from using the mixing protocol.  Maximal extractable value (MEV) refers to the rewards that block builders and validators receive from reordering transactions within a block. Flashbots, an Ethereum-based research and development team, has been working on ways to curb the potential harms of MEV extraction by building MEV-Boost, a piece of software that allows validators to request blocks from a network of builders via a middleman called a relay.  Anyone can build a relay to pass MEV-optimized blocks from builders to the validators that propose them out to the wider network.  The most popular relay by far is the one built and maintained by Flashbots itself. And herein lies the controversy – unlike some other relay providers, the Flashbots relay refuses to pass along blocks containing transactions from sanctioned addresses.  Moreover, of the five MEV-Boost relay providers only two of them, Manifold and bloXroute, provide non-censoring options.  As of writing, 57% of all blocks validated on the Ethereum blockchain used the MEV-Boost software. And of those blocks, nearly 81% of them were done via Flashbots’ relay, meaning they all excluded Tornado Cash transactions.  While it is still possible for sanctioned transactions to make it onto the Ethereum blockchain as it exists currently, this will become more difficult as more validators (and relays) opt to strike such transactions from the blocks they process. Uri Klarman, CEO of bloXroute Labs, told CoinDesk: “The fact we reached 51% of blocks excluding OFAC transactions is an important watershed moment, which we should pay attention to.”  Read more: As Censorship on Ethereum Begins, Could This Open-Sourced Code Help Counter It?  The community reacts  On Twitter, Martin Köppelmann, the co-founder of the Gnosis trading protocol and a vocal advocate for uncensoring Tornado Cash, shared a screenshot of the 51% OFAC-compliant blocks. Köppelmann pleaded: “Dear Flashbots team – I spoke to many of you personally and you committed to take actions if censorship becomes worse – but if not now, when then?”  Matt Cutler, the CEO and co-founder of Blocknative, which runs its own relay, told CoinDesk, “Flashbots has emerged as sort of the leading relay and the leading builder.” Cutler wouldn’t explicitly say if Blocknative’s relay would be censoring, but did say that it “will be filtering on OFAC SDN (Special Designated Nationals) addresses on the From to the To. That is something that we are in the process of implementing.”  Read more: What’s Going On With Ethereum’s MEV-Boost?  Chris Piatt, the co-founder of Eden Network, which also runs a censored relay, told CoinDesk, “I don’t think anyone who is deep in the Ethereum ecosystem is satisfied with the status quo (including Flashbots).” As for the continuous growth of censorship on Ethereum, Piatt added that his team has “no plans to change the way we attest to blocks that other validators/ builders have built on the validators that we run.” He added that he is “unaware of any plans on the part of our validator partners to do so” and has no plans to support any such chain from Eden’s network of builders. “We believe this is outside the scope of the regulations, and practically speaking, infeasible.”  Klarman of bloxRoute told CoinDesk that in order to avoid more censorship on Ethereum, validators should “connect to non-censoring relays like bloXroute’s ‘Ethical’ and “Max-Profit'” relays, or to Manifold’s relay.

42411346,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNEgU,1665776700,What the Regulators Said at DC Fintech Week,"Hey folks. I’m in Washington, D.C., this week for DC Fintech Week. I’m going to highlight some statements or comments that stood out to me, but on a personal note I wanted to say it was great to meet so many of you (and shoutout to those of you who said you read this newsletter – I appreciate each and every one of you!).  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  The narrative  DC Fintech Week is an annual policy conference organized by Georgetown University School of Law’s Chris Brummer. It’s a substantive conversation, but I enjoy going as much for the people I meet at the event as I do for the talks themselves.  Why it matters  I always say I go to events at least partly for the actual discussions and partly to meet fellow attendees. Here’s what the speakers at the event had to say this year.  Breaking it down  Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu opened day one, comparing crypto user interfaces to the iPhone’s development, but warning that this may trick people into thinking crypto services are similar to traditional financial services.  “In layman’s terms, until crypto matures and appropriate guardrails and gates are put in place, it would be wise to limit the scope of activities commingled within a single crypto firm – a limit on the PD [probability of default] – and to limit integration of crypto and TradFi – a limit on the LGD [loss given default],” Hsu said.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Rostin Behnam said the regulator’s case against Ooki DAO pretty much had to happen, calling it “egregious and so obvious” during a one-on-one with Brummer.  ""It was hardly decentralized,” Behnam said of the DAO. “There were a few individuals who were very much at the center.""  (Side note: This is basically what I guessed the CFTC would say, lol.)  Ooki DAO has since geofenced U.S. users but it’s unclear whether the DAO or its members have found counsel to respond to the CFTC, which it has some time to do, after a judge ruled late Wednesday that LeXpunK Army and the DeFi Education Fund can participate and argue about how the CFTC serves notice to the DAO’s members.  Custodia Bank founder Caitlin Long took aim at the Federal Reserve over BNY Mellon’s announcement that it would offer custody services for crypto.  Custodia would add a filing to its ongoing lawsuit against the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas, which has sat on Custodia’s application for master account access for over a year, Long said. The filing came the next day.  Eun Young Choi, the director of the U.S. Department of Justice’s crypto enforcement team, said crypto mixers are a challenge but have not “slowed us down.” This raised my eyebrows because we’ve heard quite a bit about the risks of anonymity in crypto potentially boosting wrongdoers.  There are three possible explanations: 1) the DOJ has a way around mixers; 2) the DOJ is running its own mixer as a honeypot; or 3) Director Choi is just saying this to throw off the folks using mixers.  Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr warned that banks tokenizing things might be a bit concerning, but also provided some insights as to why it might take (some) regulators a while to write policy.  “The range of options available for dealing with emerging technologies and those benefits are solid,” Barr said. “One of them is just risk identification, so we can enunciate to the world that we see a set of risks and that they should be looked at carefully. And that has an actual effect on behavior.”  He went on to add that regulators who write rules too quickly may find that they’ve fallen behind the actual technology or area they’re overseeing.  Rep. Patrick McHenry, the ranking Republican member of the House Financial Services Committee, said the long-anticipated stablecoin bill may happen within the next few months, but there's still some ongoing disagreements around regulatory oversight and how the assets are to be stored.  “We agree on all the components of what the asset is,” he said. “We’ve come up with a pretty ugly baby. It is a baby, nonetheless.”  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  N/A  Outside CoinDesk:  (The New York Times) Airbus and Air France are (finally) facing the families of the 228 victims of Air France flight 447 in court.

How could the problem of identity, onboarding and anti-money laundering (AML) prevention be solved?  Parallel Markets, an identity and financial services company with more than 75 financial institutions, was the “lightbulb moment,” CEO Peccatiello told CoinDesk.  Tony Peccatiello is presenting at Investing in Digital Enterprises and Assets Summit (I.D.E.A.S.), CoinDesk's newest event revealing the most scalable marketplaces in the digital economy that will attract institutional capital in the years to come.  Learn directly from entrepreneurs in leading innovation across digital assets, Web3, blockchain and the metaverse. Register here.  “Every broker-dealer [and] every crypto group has effectively rebuilt the same onboarding process over and over again,” Peccatiello said. “They collect the same information, they do the same validations. That’s just bizarre.”  The New York City-based company wants to change the traditional on- and off-ramp onboarding model by cutting out the need for customers to independently input the same information at different institutions again and again. The firm caters to both traditional firms and crypto organizations.  Parallel operates as an authenticator between two parties. Those parties, whether a traditional firm or crypto-based organization, need some way to verify a person’s background.  The company has two offerings. The first is “identity underwriting,” which validates the identity of a potential user by pulling key data about them for AML and KYC (know your customer) requirement compliance. For crypto-native firms, identity can be validated using Parallel’s PID identity token, a full on-chain token that preserves anonymity. The tool also provides sanction monitoring for both individuals and business entities globally.  Parallel’s second offering is “expression of identity,” which gives individuals the option of “sharing the minimum amount of information with the counterparty” on a permissioned basis. For crypto-based platforms, users can use the PID token for expression of identity. Permission is held by the token holder and can only be released if the person chooses to share certain markers of their identity.  “There are a lot of Web3 companies that still onboard people in a very Web2 manner, but we knew if we could build software to sell to our partners then we could get paid to grow the network,” he said.  Peccatiello believes the company is well-positioned for long-term growth. In February, Parallel raised upwards of $7 million in a Series A funding round, which was led by Union Square Ventures and included Comcast Ventures and Lux Capital, among others.  “As there are more people leveraging tokens or verifiable credentials, we get paid and so do investors,” Peccatiello said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/10/14/parallel-markets-looks-to-bridge-identity-verification-across-platforms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/04c61fbb327e8d49a61c63b54551602de782a351-594x445.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394497,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw9641,1665774409,NFTs and Intellectual Property: What Do You Actually Own?,"Non-fungible tokens (NFT) gained popularity in early 2021, when generative art and profile picture (PFP) projects such as CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club were touted by celebrities and used as a sign of affiliation to different crypto communities. These crypto tokens cannot be replicated and represent ownership of an asset, real or digital.  As the early NFT frenzy has cooled, digital artists have sought to bolster the value of these collectibles beyond speculative trading on the secondary market. From TV shows to merchandise, some projects have expanded possibilities for commercializing NFT artwork.  But not every NFT project allows its holders to monetize the underlying artwork, and NFT creators will need to outline the terms and conditions of how their artwork can and cannot be used by new owners. In turn, NFT holders must follow certain preset rules outlined by intellectual property laws.  What is intellectual property?  Intellectual property (IP), as defined by the World Intellectual Property Organization, refers to “creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works; designs and symbols, names; and images used in commerce.” These works are protected by laws that prevent others from profiting off or taking undue credit for something they did not create.  Three common types of intellectual property protected by law are patent, copyright and trademark. Patent law applies to inventions with some type of public utility; copyright law applies to literary and artistic works such as books and music; and trademark law is usually associated with business and involves the act of “marking” one’s goods or services to distinguish them from other businesses.  While these types of intellectual property are protected by laws, the enforcement of these laws remains a challenge within the realm of blockchain-based creations, where NFTs are sometimes made from stolen art and questions over creative ownership rights have led to lawsuits with murky resolutions.  Who owns the IP of an NFT?  Ownership over the intellectual property of an NFT is not always clearly defined. Cornell University legal scholars James Grimmelmann, Yan Ji and Tyler Kell wrote in a blog post in March that it is often challenging to fit NFTs into the traditional framework of copyright law.  “Ownership of an NFT can be used to give the owner substantial control over a creative work, but that control is not automatic,” they wrote. “Copyright law does not give an NFT owner any rights unless the creator takes affirmative steps to make sure that it does.”  They added that in surveying some NFT projects, “very few of them take all of the necessary steps needed to make NFT copyrights behave the way that community members expect.”  In an article titled “Demystifying NFTs and Intellectual Property: What You Need to Know,” authors Elizabeth Ferrill, Soniya Shah and Michael Young suggest that NFTs “may be subject to IP protections, including copyright, design patent and trademark rights.” They explain that when an NFT is minted or sold, a blockchain’s smart contract will automatically execute the transfer of ownership, including any rules applicable to the NFT like terms of purchase or resale opportunities. This often means that when an NFT is traded, a license that informs collectors about what they can and can’t do with their new asset goes along with it.  According to Ferrill, Shah and Young, most NFT creators restrict commercial use and include a license that only gives holders the rights to “use, copy and display” the NFT.  As an example, they cite that Twitter founder Jack Dorsey sold his first-ever tweet as an NFT to a buyer named Sina Estavi. While Estavi owns the non-fungible token linked to the tweet, Dorsey retains the copyright, which means that Estavi can’t print the tweet on T-shirts or sell other merchandise without Dorsey’s permission.  Jeremy Goldman, a lawyer at Frankfurt Kurnit Klein & Selz who focuses on intellectual property and blockchain technology, told CoinDesk that copyright is always an “opt-in” structure, meaning that NFT artists can choose whether to specify what buyers of their artwork can do.  Whether or not a token you purchase has these defined outright, as an NFT owner, you should familiarize yourself with different types of licensing designations:  Personal  Some NFT creators don’t explicitly outline an intellectual property license. According to Goldman, not specifying an IP license operates as a personal license by default. He explained that if an NFT project doesn't specify its IP license, it is safest for a buyer to assume that they do not own the intellectual property rights and that their use of the NFT is restricted to personal only.  Under a personal license, buyers can only use the NFT artwork for non-commercial purposes. For example, a collector can use the NFT as their profile picture on social media or display the art in their home using a digital frame. But holders can’t use their asset to make a profit, like selling prints of the artwork or using the artwork to create a spin-off book series.  “For a lot of the one-of-one projects, artists are not super thrilled about letting people just go out and make use of their artwork,” said Goldman.  Commercial  A commercial license allows a creator to designate some rights to a buyer while still retaining ownership and control of the IP. In some cases, this includes allowing the buyer to sell the NFT artwork on merchandise, creating a TV show with an NFT character or even plastering the image on a food truck, as seen with the Bored & Hungry restaurant project.  There are many types of commercial licensing structures.  Yuga Labs, the company behind Bored Ape Yacht Club, recently acquired the CryptoPunks and Meebits NFT collections. In August, the company released the full commercial rights to NFT holders, allowing them to use their characters in commercial or personal projects.  In some commercial licensing structures, the buyer must pay royalties to the original creator of the NFT. This is often a percentage amount established by the original creator, usually calculated per sale. A royalty-free license bypasses those requirements.  Last month, NFT platform X2Y2 introduced a flexible royalties feature that provides buyers with a choice of how much they want to contribute to the original NFT project. The announcement drew criticism, with some arguing that the structure would hurt NFT artists.  NFT collection ZINU offers holders a royalty-free license, allowing them to “use and commercialize their respective NFTs within their own industries.”  Mario Rossi, chief technology officer at ZINU, told CoinDesk that its licensing designation encourages buyers to be creative with how they choose to utilize the asset. From backpacks to chess boards and figurines, NFT holders are allowed to use the ZINU narrative in their own creations.  “You don't have to kickback anything to us, even though you're using our name to build your brand,“ said Rossi. “We want to really incentivize people to do things with it because it spreads the word of the project that gets people out there, it gets them familiar with it.”  Tara Fung, co-founder and CEO of NFT infrastructure startup Co:Create, told CoinDesk that most NFT collectors prefer commercial licenses as it provides them an opportunity to monetize the NFT's IP. Some artists prefer it too as it creates strong incentives for NFT collectors to promote the collection and seek out licensing opportunities.  Alternative licensing structures  There are a growing number of alternative licenses that NFT artists are using to designate usage rights to their artwork.  For example, the nonprofit organization Creative Commons offers six different licensing structures that NFT creators can use to grant certain permissions to collectors.  One example is the Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license that NFT artist Kelly Milligan chose for his generative art collection titled Act of Emotion. Under this license, buyers of his NFTs are free to “remix, transform and build upon the material,” but in doing so must give appropriate credit to Milligan and not use the material for any commercial purposes.  One designation that has sparked controversy in the NFT space is CC0.  Creative Commons defines this license as any creative work in the worldwide public domain that has “no copyright.” In other words, anyone can copy, modify and distribute the artwork, even for commercial purposes.  In August, NFT collective PROOF switched the license of its Moonbird collection from commercial to CC0, allowing anyone to creatively remix the project. The decision sparked debate amongst holders and opened up a conversation about defining IP licensing designations.  Crypto venture capital firm a16z released a collection of six licenses designed specifically for NFTs that are embedded on-chain and deployed through smart contracts. The “Can’t Be Evil” licenses are publicly available and aim to help creators protect their IP, provide NFT holders with easy-to-understand rights and help foster community.  Laying out terms clearly prevents misunderstandings  Deciding what IP designation to use is an important part of a creator’s journey in releasing an NFT collection. With NFTs becoming more functional in terms of long-term utility, it is becoming increasingly necessary to define what that utility looks like for holders that buy into a project's ecosystem.  New data suggests that more NFT trademark applications have been filed this year than last year, a promising sign for creators and holders building for the long term.  Goldman told CoinDesk that there’s “a lot of mythology,” surrounding NFT IP licenses, and there is often a misunderstanding buried within the terms of the agreement – or a lack thereof.  “Unless [artists] say something out loud or put something in writing, no one gets any rights until they say otherwise,” said Goldman.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/nfts-and-intellectual-property-what-do-you-actually-own,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f7f05ba48fd3ecf5a57bc261ad62986904cee4b4-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411349,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNEn6,1665773950,"Bitcoin Is Macro, but Not ‘Correlated’ in the Way You Think","“Bitcoin is correlated!”  I often hear that thrown out in conversations as a dismissive way of saying that it isn’t really an “alternative” asset at all, and that all this mumbo jumbo about it being external to the broader economy is just ""hopium."" But very few who say this have actually dug into the data or thought about the reasoning behind that claim (which is understandable – why mess with convenient narratives?). I confess that even I used to think that the surge in the correlation between bitcoin (BTC) and the S&P 500 was because the institutional investors marched into the market in the second half of last year. Now I’m not so sure. The institutions did indeed march in, and bitcoin has to a large extent become a macro asset. But I don’t think that’s driving the correlation data.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and sister company Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  Before we start looking at charts that tell a different story, let’s have a think about what correlation actually means, and why we care. In theory, correlation is simply the measure of the degree to which the movements of two series are related. It measures how much two measures vary together, divided by how much they usually vary individually. (There are other types of correlation with different formulas, but that’s too nerdy to get into here – for those who care, I use Pearson on a rolling 60-day window.)  Imagine two assets that are clones of each other. How much they move independently will be exactly the same as how much they move together, so the ratio between the two factors will be 1. A correlation of -1 means they move perfectly in the opposite direction. A correlation of 0 means there is no obvious relationship between the two.  In reality, these “perfect” situations never exist. Correlations are generally a messy amalgam of erratic behavior that indicates strong or weak relationships, used by investors to design relatively robust portfolio strategies and by analysts and storytellers to spot changes in trends.  Yet, one trap many fall into is to treat correlation as a binary condition. To say something “is” correlated is vague and inaccurate. Highly correlated, negatively correlated – those qualifications make sense, yet even then only at a specific point in time. As we will see, when it comes to market relationships, especially concerning an asset as young as bitcoin, things change fast.  Another frequent trap is to assume that a high or low correlation can explain behavior. To some extent this is true – but more often than not, the relationship is coincidental even if related. Ice cream sales and cases of sunburn are highly correlated, but one does not cause or explain the other.  Back to bitcoin. As you can see below, the asset used to be pretty much uncorrelated to the S&P 500 (oscillating around 0) even as the institutions marched in, pushing the BTC price to an all-time high in November. But something changed in April 2022.  What changed? The overall market mood. Correlation is more about the direction than the size of the price moves (although both matter). The below chart shows that, up until the time that the 60-day BTC-S&P 500 correlation had crossed 0 on the way up (never to return?), the two series had sort of been moving in sync but not really. By April 4, the S&P 500 was down 0.7% on the year while BTC was down 7.5%, and the 60 days prior (the snapshot window for the correlation calculation on any given day) showed different trends for each.  What triggered the mood change? Interest rate expectations. Fed funds above 2.50% started to become a remote possibility in terms of market pricing in early April 2022 (when the actual range was 0.25%-0.50%).  This freaked the market out, and the macro investors who piled into the crypto market over the previous nine to 10 months exited in a hurry. They didn’t just exit crypto (a high-risk asset relatively easy to sell), they also exited equities. Prices fell across the board, and the 60-day correlation between bitcoin and the leading stock index rocketed up to an all-time high of 0.72. Macro investors weren’t the only ones de-risking – crypto fund managers were also exiting, expecting a general market slump.  The spike in correlation was not because bitcoin was now a “macro asset” – bitcoin’s entrance to general portfolios had been more or less consolidated the previous year. It was because bitcoin, along with other “risky” assets, was being hit by expectations of monetary tightening. Semantics, perhaps – but it matters, for the same reason that sunblock manufacturers are in a very different business than ice cream makers even though their sales can move together at certain times of the year.  Then, in mid-May, came the implosion of the Terra stablecoin ecosystem. This was a crypto-specific crisis and, unsurprisingly, correlations fell as the damage to crypto values far exceeded that in equities. The de-leveraging triggered by the collapse of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital led to a further decoupling.  With that digested, correlations are on their way up again. But this is not, contrary to common perception, necessarily because bitcoin and stocks are joined at the hip. There’s an old adage that says that “in times of fear, all correlations go to 1.” We are in times of fear. But bitcoin and stocks have very, very different value premises, so we cannot assume the correlations will remain high.  Bitcoin is a macro asset in that it is now part of the global market. But not all macro assets are highly correlated. As fear subsides (which it will, one day), given the distinct value propositions of equities and crypto, we are likely to see correlations head back to lower levels, supporting the narrative of an “alternative” macro asset. Even before then, as the dust settles on the recent crypto crashes, as the outlook for global equities continues to get worse and as the risk of holding dollars shifts higher, we could see investors calibrate the relative downsides of asset groups. The resulting flows of funds are likely to change correlations and narratives, driving a new momentum that impacts correlations even further.  So, it is correct to say “bitcoin is macro,” now and going forward. To say “bitcoin is correlated,” however, requires more nuance and explanation, especially to emphasize that the numerical relationship may be convenient for the moment, but it does not mean what many think it does. And it is almost certain to change.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/14/bitcoin-is-macro-but-not-correlated-in-the-way-you-think,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90f7c6ff9cad8df9ec82da4a8e1226e17b2fa777-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420938,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtvxd,1665773128,Clixpesa Is Bringing Traditional Kenyan Investing Techniques to Web3,"Derrick Kachisa and Samuel Moyi, full-stack developers from Kericho in Kenya, noticed that locals didn't have access to the information about traditional finance they needed to invest wisely. So they founded Clixpesa, a payments app that wants to simplify finance.  Clixpesa is developing easy-to-understand financial tools for savings, loans and insurance, co-founder Kachisa said in an interview. The app will have elements of Venmo and Web3, enabling peer-to-peer payments and loans as well as interest-bearing savings accounts.  Clixpesa is a finalist in CoinDesk's Web3athon. The winners are announced at the I.D.E.A.S. conference Oct. 18 and 19.  ""When we look at the financial products that are offered now, such as loans, savings, and insurance, these things are complicated since traditional financial institutions are creating them,"" Kachisa said. ""The Kenyan community is deterred from these services because they aren't being explained or implemented in a simplified way that a normal person can understand.""  Up to this point the team of two has been developing Clixpesa in their spare time, with no funding. As participants in Web3athon (a joint CRADL and CoinDesk effort to support community-oriented crypto projects), Kachisa and Moyi are aiming to have a minimum viable product by the end of the year to test on their local community. At this point, they'll consider how to source funding.  See also: IndigiDAO: Bringing Blockchain to Indigenous Communities  The project’s name is derived from one of the most successful peer to peer but non-crypto payments systems called M-PESA. M-PESA simplified digital transactions in Kenya but has yet to provide more complex financial tools.  The first product Clixpesa developed is a digitized version of a Kenyan community-saving tool called a Chama – more traditionally known as a ROSCA, or rotating savings and credit association.  When a community member has something he needs a lot of capital for, like medication, his peers will come together to save up collectively. Once the target is hit, the person will receive their money and the Chama will start saving for the next person until everyone’s needs are met.  This is a great way to raise money within a community, but it has issues, Kachisa said. First, once someone has received money from the Chama they could simply leave and never contribute again. Second, who do you trust to hold the funds? Once again, that person could simply leave with all of the money.  Clixpesa aims to fix these issues by bringing this cooperative saving technique to Web3. Instead of cash, people can use M-PESA or any of Clixpesa’s other payment options. And instead of a person holding the Chama’s funds, it’s a smart contract.  The funds will be released when at least three participants authorize the transaction – creating a trustless Chama fund storage system. In time, Clixpesa will also release a trustless payment system, group insurance fund and implementation for third-party services.  However, there is still the issue of someone leaving after receiving their payment. Clixpesa tries to fix this by tackling the reasons why someone may leave. As a result, users are able to skip and break down payments into smaller contributions.  See also: I.D.E.A.S.: Investing in the Future of Digitization and Computing  This first stage of development was completed during the Web3athon, which will announce winners of the six month-long hackathon at the upcoming I.D.E.A.S. conference. The project will enter its second stage of development at the Celo’s Mobile Hackathon.  Clixpesa's second product will allow Chamas to lend their funds to others for a small amount of interest. This allows Chamas to grow their funds but also makes it easier for regular Kenyans to get loans.  ""In Kenya lending is very costly. The APY on loans is in the 200 percentile,"" Kachisa said. ""That's why we want to use peer-to-peer so we're able to lower the interest for normal users.""  As a long-term goal, Kachisa and Moyi want to bring investing in stocks and crypto to Kenya. In the medium term, it’s all about making their Chamas service as frictionless as possible – bringing a traditional investing technique to Web3.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN,Ryan S.

The cryptocurrency’s trajectory appeared to diverge from U.S. stocks, as the S&P 500 slid 1.8%, retracing some of its gains notched at the end of Thursday’s wild swings.  The CoinDesk Market Index was up 0.06% as of press time. Ether (ETH) rose 2.7% to around $1,300.  “BTC and ETH continue to defy the equity sell-off,” Tom Dunleavy, senior research analyst at Messari, told CoinDesk in an email. “If equities continue to sell off, we may continue to hold these levels as we have reached the base of long-term holders.”  Global markets resembled a roller coaster on Thursday after the hotter-than-expected Consumer Price Index inflation report was released.  Crypto analysts are increasingly speculating whether digital assets like bitcoin might decouple from equity markets.  “If U.S. stocks tumble below the 3,600 level this earnings season and bitcoin does not break below the summer lows, the crypto winter can officially be called over,” Oanda analyst Edward Moya wrote in a note Friday.  Messari’s Dunleavy noted that the stream of third-quarter earnings reports starting to roll out and further data on the labor market will be critical factors in the crypto market’s direction next week.  “If we continue to see labor market strength, the Federal Reserve will have even more ammo to raise 75 basis points or even 100 basis points,” Dunleavy said. Typically in past interest-rate-hiking cycles, the Fed has moved in increments of 25 basis points (0.25 percentage point) per meeting.  So the fact that traders see the Fed possibly raising rates by a full percentage point shows the urgency of U.S. central bankers’ campaign to tamp down soaring inflation. And in general, interest-rate increases typically reduce the appeal of risky assets including stocks and cryptocurrencies.  “Again, this could be a spot that traders see as an opportunity to sell,” Dunleavy said.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/14/bitcoin-steady-above-19k-even-as-stocks-give-back-thursdays-wild-gains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/712b332a71cb287b1aeded30a8cbd506fe878f6f-1140x598.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42416078,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuYFYV,1665767367,A Huge Glut of Bitcoin Mining Rigs Is Sitting Unused in Boxes,"Hundreds of thousands of brand new mining rigs that could be generating bitcoin (BTC) have never been used, further skewing the economics of cryptocurrency mining, a sector that has been hit hard by sinking prices for bitcoin and other tokens and by high energy costs.  Last year, miners struggled to buy enough rigs. Manufacturers couldn’t fulfill orders fast enough. Now, Matt Schultz, executive chairman of bitcoin miner CleanSpark (CLSK), figures 250,000 to 500,000 mining rigs are still sealed up in boxes in the U.S. alone, based on his conversations with analysts. Ethan Vera, chief operating officer of mining services firm Luxor Technologies, put the number at 276,000 worldwide in September.  Whatever the exact number is, this much is clear: The economics at the core of crypto are completely out of whack. More evidence of that came in September when Compute North, which runs data centers that host mining computers, filed for bankruptcy.  Read more: How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?  The reasons aren’t hard to follow: The price of bitcoin and other tokens have plunged dramatically, making the digital assets that miners earn less valuable. And miners’ costs have risen because of skyrocketing energy prices. It takes a lot of electricity to mine bitcoin, a process that involves specialized computers, known as mining rigs or machines, guessing the answer to an equation to receive bitcoin as a reward.  While many in the industry agree that rigs stuck in boxes are plentiful, there’s less agreement on exactly why they haven’t been installed yet. Some experts said there’s no room for them in data centers. Others said there’s plenty of space, but rigs are too expensive to run given the current market conditions.  Luxor’s Vera said that there is “limited rack space immediately available,” more than a year after China banned crypto mining, sending miners flocking to the U.S. and Kazakhstan. That has allowed hosting companies in countries that haven’t banned mining to boost their fees.  Core Scientific (CORZ) is the biggest miner in the world by hashrate, or the amount of computing power being directed toward a particular cryptocurrency’s blockchain. The company “has been able to revise its pricing structure for its hosting fee base rate as demand for racks has surged,"" CEO Mike Levitt said in an interview. One person familiar with the matter said Core Scientific has increased its fee by 20% to 25% in recent months.  Hosting is a service that data centers provide to crypto miners so that customers can store their mining rigs and mine their preferred digital assets for a fee without having to build the accompanying infrastructure themselves. Core both self-mines bitcoin and hosts for other miners.  The impact of energy markets  But soaring energy prices and a plunging bitcoin price have made hosting machines unprofitable. As a result, less hosting services that are now profitable for the miners are available, making it harder for miners to find a cheap place to run their machines.  “There’s a difference between having no rack space and having no cheap rack space,” said Alex Martini, CEO of New York-based miner Blockfusion USA.  Now, there is rack space to plug the machines in, but hosting fees are too high because of high energy prices.  “We have 32 [megawatts] of empty space, and there are other sites that have [a total of] 400 MW of rack space,” but customers aren’t interested because energy rates are too high and the price of bitcoin is too low, Martini said.  “Power and hosting” aren’t constraints on the industry at the moment, but “the trick is” making the economics work given high energy prices, said Charlie Schumacher, vice president of corporate communications at Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), which has machines hosted at Compute North’s facilities.  Before signing with Applied Blockchain (APLD) for 200 MW of capacity, Marathon vetted at least 30 hosting options, Schumacher said. “There's more supply for hosting than there are people looking to fill it right now,” even though plenty of machines are sitting around, he said.  Martini said new mining machines can still sell for a premium, so miners aren’t unpacking them unless they can mine crypto for a profit.  Meanwhile, Schumacher said some miners are cutting their fees to attract new customers.  “Over the more recent months, we have noticed that hosting price quotes have started to decline. We suspect that it will continue for the rest of the year,” said Rob Chang, CEO and founder of bitcoin miner Gryphon Digital Mining.  Vera agreed that the requirement for cheap power “slows down the development of infrastructure,” and so overall supply is limited.  Manufacturer discounts  Despite the oversupply, manufacturers are still making mining rigs, albeit at a discounted selling price.  In late August, Bitmain, the world’s largest mining rig maker, unveiled a coupon program, offering up to 30% discounts to large customers that bought machines in the summer of 2021. In September, it announced an approximately 30% discount on the Antminer S19 Pro 100 terahash model.  Some miners, including CleanSpark, Core Scientific and Marathon, have exercised a clause in their contracts – called “price protection” – that allows them to adjust the prices paid for the new rigs.  Contracts for mining rigs usually require a deposit, with the rest of the funds paid in installments as shipments leave the manufacturer. For big contracts, manufacturers included this “price protection” clause, which means that before every shipment, the two parties can evaluate the market price and adjust the payments.  Xmei Lin, head of marketing at Bitmain told CoinDesk that the price protection feature offers “bulk order customers protection against market price volatility."" If “cryptocurrency market prices decrease,” Bitmain will reduce the price of purchased mining machines, based on monthly price analysis, Lin said.  The other two big equipment manufacturers, MicroBT and Canaan, declined to comment on this story.  Still, given the capital constraints in the market, there is less demand for mining rigs now, and miners have even had to cancel orders they raised capital for last year, Schumacher said.  Whether this continues, “depends on the price of bitcoin,” he said.

While the projections for the inflation rates were high, they would come out lower than the actual number and the crypto market had responded negatively to the news. Bitcoin had fallen below $19,000 as the market had bled, but there had been a turnaround towards the end of the trading day. The question now remains if the digital asset would be able to hold these gains. Can Bitcoin Keep Up? Over the last 24 hours, the price of bitcoin has risen more than 6%, bringing it close to the $20,000 resistance level. This level remains hard to beat for the digital asset due to the resistance being mounted at this junction by bears and indicators point to bitcoin not being able to rise above this level. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Adds Another Zero, Is It Time To Jump Ship? Fuad Fatullaev, Co-Founder and CEO at Web3 ecosystem WeWay, explained that bitcoin was already known to react to the CPI data release in such a way. And since there is no expected slowdown in inflation rates in the near future, retail and institutional investors are wary of getting into the market.

42411328,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNDmH,1665765084,Why Did Crypto Surge After Bad Inflation News?,"Thursday, Oct. 13, was one of the strangest days for asset markets in recent memory. Stocks, bonds and bitcoin all closed flat to up despite gloomy inflation news that should have triggered a broad sell-off. It’s an important moment for reflection on the all-too-human strangeness of markets – and the temptation and risk of explaining that strangeness with simplified narratives.  The day began with the release of new U.S. inflation numbers, which among other data showed that the consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.4% in September. That’s an acceleration from August, when month-over-month inflation was 0.1%, which had raised hopes the U.S. Federal Reserve had bent the curve on inflation.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Thursday’s inflation data dashed those hopes. The immediate, sensible implication was that the Fed would continue raising interest rates aggressively. That would make the outlook for stocks and crypto worse while pushing up bond yields. All of those things happened after the inflation news.  For about an hour. And then things got weird.  Starting at around 9:30 a.m. ET, stocks and crypto bounced sharply. Bitcoin rocketed up 7.8% from a low of $18,372 to end Thursday at just over $19,800. At almost the exact same time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) found a bottom at $28,709, then proceeded to rip up 4.6% to $30,038 by the close. Bond prices also dipped before recovering though, unlike stocks and crypto, bonds didn’t recover all of their early losses.  There’s little case to be made that anything more important than inflation data happened Thursday. And everything else is looking fairly gloomy, with the new U.K. government still a basket case and, at best, a faint light at the end of the Russia-Ukraine tunnel.  So a rational person can only look at yesterday’s rally and ask: What the &#$%?  For a start, your first mistake was in being rational. Financial journalists across the board had a rare and appropriate moment of humility Thursday, with many admitting quite simply that what had happened couldn’t be straightforwardly explained.  Even fairly compelling attempts took on a note of absurdism. Sam Ro, editor of Tker.co, had both the funniest and the most intriguing analysis.  Ro is simultaneously joking and serious. The Fed’s monetary policy has come to dominate asset price predictions, turning asset markets into a giant game of second-guessing ChairmanJerome Powell. That often leads asset prices to perform inversely to their fundamentals in the short term. It was common even before the inflation fight, for instance, for a strong jobs report to sink the stock market. That’s because while higher employment is a sign of a healthy economy, it also portends rising interest rates that are bad for asset prices.  See also: Federal Reserve to Act 'Forthrightly, Strongly' Until Inflation Abates  This was basically paralleled in the initial response to the CPI: Hot inflation numbers signaled the economy is still going strong, but also that the Fed will be more hawkish on raising rates. That’s why assets would logically sink.  Ro’s modest proposal is that markets merely added a layer of forward reflexivity. If you’re moving prices down today because you expect a tougher rate hike next month, does it make any less sense to move prices up because the tougher rate hike next month will lead to a recession and lower rates next year? Why, it’s so crazy it just might work.  Or maybe it’s just plain crazy. Ro’s hypothesis is fundamentally unfalsifiable – you can’t actually poll everyone who drove prices up Thursday, and even if you could many of them wouldn’t even have clear reasoning for their own moves.  Part of Ro’s implied joke is that all financial analysis is about telling similarly reductive just-so stories. People do stuff for all kinds of reasons, including bad reasons, and markets are ultimately made up of people. A smart investor never forgets just how unpredictable, illogical and even absurd that can make them.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,David Z.

42421220,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhqgf,1665764784,IndigiDAO: Bringing Blockchain to Indigenous Communities,"“My tribe is Absentee Shawnee – the tribe of Tecumseh,” says Henry Foreman. “He created his own tribe among tribes, building a larger community. So this is my version of something that’s deep in my history.”  Foreman is the founder of IndigiDAO, a new cryptocurrency education and development project that will be featured at CoinDesk’s IDEAS conference next week.  In the late 18th and early 19th century, Tecumseh traveled widely from the Shawnee’s homeland in the Northeastern U.S., building an intertribal coalition to resist European incursions. That model remains a powerful inspiration for Native Americans and other Indigenous groups.  IndigiDAO is a finalist in CoinDesk's Web3athon. The winners are announced at the I.D.E.A.S. conference October 18 and 19.  IndigiDAO is Foreman’s effort to draw together a similarly scattered group: Indigenous artisans and entrepreneurs. Foreman launched the project as part of his role as program director at New Mexico Community Capital, where his focus is on business, finance, and technology education for aspiring Indigenous businesspeople.  Though IndigiDAO has sprawling ambitions, it’s starting with two primary goals. On the one hand, Foreman says entrepreneurs in his community want more education on crypto.  “This is a form of digital financial literacy,” he says. “We want to meet entrepreneurs where they’re at.” IndigiDAO is building a hands-on educational program that starts with basics like setting up wallets, and proceeds to more complex applications and concepts.  At the same time, traditional craftspeople face a concrete problem that blockchain technology could help solve: authentication of handcrafted work, which is often imitated and undercut by non-Native interlopers.  “It’s a big issue – people making fake Indigenous art, jewelry, copying designs,” says Foreman. “Our traditional makers aren’t making enough income, aren’t being [properly] valued in the traditional marketplace. They gather the mud from the riverside and hand-fire it. It’s hard for that to compete [on price] against someone who’s buying a pot made in a factory and just painting it.” Issuing non-fungible tokens to authenticate items created by IndigiDAO members could be one way to tackle fakes.  But IndigiDAO wants to do more than solve one market problem. Its mission states it aims to “advance Indigenous core values like collaboration, reciprocity, shared ownership and nourishment-based exchange without exploiting the communities and individuals involved.”  That’s particularly intriguing for Native American tribes, including the Absentee Shawnee, whose members receive basic income-like dividend payments from tribal enterprises such as casinos. Foreman believes a DAO could become a model for helping tribal members use those funds more effectively by coordinating – even among members scattered across wide geographic areas – just as Tecumseh’s coalition did two centuries ago.  “Can you imagine a tribe that adopted a shared governance model?” Foreman asks. “That would be game changing.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,David Z.

42411340,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNEJL,1665764400,Ugly Bargains Between Banks and Regulators Are Rearing Their Head Again,"Season Five of the Showtime series “Billions” ends with a scene that exposes the ugly bargain governments strike with banks and how that deal works against society’s interest.  It seems apt to reflect on those relationships now, when the “too-big-to-fail” financial system that’s built on that bargain is in its most fragile state in 13 years, and to ponder what, if anything, the crypto alternative offers.  In the scene, swashbuckling hedge fund manager Bobby Axelrod discovers he has been lured into criminal vulnerability by his arch nemeses, New York Attorney General Chuck Rhoades Jr. and financier Mike Prince. After being baited into accepting deposits at his newly incorporated Axe Bank from a cannabis company, Axelrod is told he was in breach of fiduciary duty for not “knowing your customer.” It turns out that the weed supplier had been selling unauthorized product, a crime for which Axelrod and his bank would now also be culpable.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  It’s the “KYC” requirements that matter here. Along with anti-money laundering (AML) compliance rules, they comprise an all-encompassing surveillance system designed to prevent criminals from hiding their financial footprints. As we’ve frequently argued in this column, and on the ""Money Reimagined"" podcast, the KYC-AML system has evolved to become an excessive constraint on financial access and a dangerous imposition on liberty and privacy – even if the original security intent was reasonable.  But it’s the other side of the bargain that makes this interesting, the part that was so attractive to Axelrod (played by Damian Lewis) that he acquired an entity with a bank charter and folded his once high-earning Axe Capital fund into it. There are real perks that come with being a compliant, regulated institution, perks that make it easy to make money – or in Axelrod’s case, to protect his wealth.  There are various benefits in this deal. There’s coverage by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for banks’ depositors. There’s access to a backstop of funding from the Federal Reserve if it’s ever needed. And, as we discovered in 2008, for the biggest banks the safety net even extends to the federal government providing bailouts in times of crisis.  These explicit and implied guarantees are a license to mint money – literally. By protecting banks’ downside risks, they keep their sources of capital cheap, which in turn allows banks to leverage those funds into profitable loans and investments, milking the interest rate spread ad infinitum.  All of this is part and parcel of the fractional reserve arrangement through which banks essentially create our money by lending out deposits. Because banks are integral to our economy for both storing our money and paying it to each other, the federal government provides those backstops to mitigate the risk of a “run” bringing down the entire system, as was feared in 2008.  Perverse outcomes  The problem is that this bargain – KYC-AML compliance in return for backstops – creates perverse incentives and outcomes.  One is that in a world of sophisticated financial criminals, banks are compelled to create ever more stringent disclosure demands on depositors. This especially hurts the poor, who cannot furnish the identity proofs and other documentation needed to pass muster. Meanwhile, those rules are weaponized by the likes of Chuck Rhoades for personal vendettas or political interests.  Another perverse outcome came to light in the post-mortems of the 2008 crisis. The perceived absence of downside risks creates moral hazard, leading profit-seeking bankers to engage in excessively leveraged bets.  All of this has created a symbiotic relationship between regulators and banks that’s very hard to disentangle without disrupting this otherwise broken system.  We see the problem in the revolving door phenomenon of regulatory agency staff moving to Wall Street jobs and vice versa. And it explains the frustration in Caitlin Long’s voice this week as the CEO of crypto-based Custodia Bank told a DC Fintech Week audience of the Federal Reserve’s double standards. Long, an articulate innovator, said Custodia would amend its lawsuit against the Federal Reserve – citing it for stalling a Custodia application for a central bank account – to reference the fact that BNY Mellon, the largest custodian bank in the world, has been approved to custody its clients’ bitcoin.  Global stress  Now this global system is showing signs of fragility once again. The U.K. is propping up its debt markets; a soaring dollar is creating economic and political tensions in big economies like Japan and small ones like Lebanon; and talk is rising again that a major multinational bank – Credit Suisse – is in serious trouble.  It’s why Edward Snowden’s tweet this week resurfacing Satoshi Nakamoto’s famous insertion into the first Bitcoin transaction was so apt.  The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks https://t.co/yUdylzFprA  — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) October 11, 2022  The exiled privacy activist artfully reminded us of what’s at stake in his technology. (Hint: IOt’s not “number go up.”)  But let’s also recognize that Satoshi’s 2009 vision for an alternative system of money – where payments aren’t routed through government-regulated intermediaries but are made peer-to-peer – has not, so far at least, come anywhere near to dislodging the old system.  Partly, that’s because U.S. and other governments’ agencies have demonstrated their unparalleled power to control the on- and off-ramps into the crypto economy – which, unavoidably, involve the very same banks that crypto developers are seeking to bypass. Whether through onerous KYC rules or through sanctions list orders as in the Tornado Cash case, regulations and enforcements have clipped crypto’s wings.  But it’s also because the crypto community itself lost sight of the bigger mission. It became obsessed with speculation on tokens, which led some prominent operators in the industry to adopt some of the same – if not worse – Wall Street practices of centralized custody, leverage and rehypothecation.  Opportunity  Still, crypto winter offers a powerful lesson for the community, now focused on “BUIDLing,” to come up with systems, approaches and self-regulatory solutions that can help weed out these ugly elements.  There could not be a better time for the industry to make its case. As Financial Times columnist Edward Luce noted this week, “The world is starting to hate the Fed,” thanks to its aggressive rate hikes and the resultant surge in the dollar. The U.S.’s fastest growing export, Luce wrote, is “monetary pain.”  Much like 2008, this unsettling moment will spur a host of new ideas for redesigning the global financial system. Unlike 2008, there is now a radically different technological model to draw from.  When policymakers gather to assess these ideas it’s unclear whether crypto will get a seat at the table. But it will certainly be making a racket just outside the dining room.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Michael J.

42416086,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuYFiZ,1665759464,BlockTower Putting $150M Crypto Fund to Work as Valuations Return ‘Down to Earth’,"Crypto asset manager BlockTower Capital revealed a new venture-capital arm this week and lifted the veil on a $150 million fund that opened in December and was fully subscribed in a matter of weeks. What motivated one of the original crypto-native asset-management brands to enter the VC world, and what will those investments look like amid crypto winter?  BlockTower launched the fund in stealth last winter as part of a “show-don’t-tell” ethos that’s also represented in the firm’s sparse website and corporate Twitter account. Limited partners that invested in the vehicle included insurance giant MassMutual, French-government-backed Bpifrance and the Teachers Retirement System of Texas. Early investments for the fund include layer 1 blockchain Aptos and institutional finance network Maple Finance.  The new venture-capital arm is led by general partner Thomas Klocanas, a veteran of investment firm White Star Capital.  “We wanted to have something to announce more than just that we raised money,” Klocanas told CoinDesk in an interview. “Here we are 10 months later with a fully fledged team that we’re super proud to reveal to the world, a network of venture partners that will be announcing in the coming weeks, a portfolio of a couple of projects and a vision we have now validated with our portfolio.”  Origin story  BlockTower was founded in 2017 by Ari Paul – who previously managed the portfolio of the University of Chicago – and former Goldman Sachs vice president Matthew Goetz. The Miami-based firm has historically invested across three strategies, including an active trading flagship fund offering exposure to liquid crypto assets, a market-neutral fund and a credit vehicle backing real-world assets like fintech and auto loans.  Before this new venture fund, BlockTower had a portfolio of 40-plus projects, said Klocanas. The firm’s structure, however, meant those venture-capital deals were put in so-called side pockets, a type of account hedge funds use to separate riskier or illiquid assets. That meant the deals were on the smaller side with a shorter-term focus.  For this new fund, early investors in BlockTower (the company itself) – which included large traditional VC players – suggested the firm pursue a true venture-capital strategy, rather than just those side pocket investments.  Investment focus  The new BlockTower fund was set up to be crypto generalist, tapping into employee expertise in areas ranging from consumer crypto to decentralized finance (DeFi) to infrastructure.  “In DeFi, we’re spending a lot of time at the intersection of DeFi and credit,” Klocanas said. “We’re thinking about mobile infrastructure, about privacy infrastructure. We are starting to think about the Web3 consumer social layer. We’re super-interested in the future of decentralized governance in crypto and beyond.”  The check sizes from the fund will be in the area of $500,000 to $6 million, with BlockTower preferring to lead or co-lead the rounds. The capital will be deployed over roughly three years, a deadline that’s flexible, though BlockTower has no plans to burn through the fund in less than a year like some other crypto-focused VC firms, Klocanas said.  Venture-capital firms often provide companies with operational support, which can include intangible assistance like recruiting help or technical participation such as operating nodes on a network, and BlockTower is still formalizing strategy in that area, Klocanas said.  Bear market investing  The timing last December meant the fund raised its capital during the tail end of a bull market but is deploying during a bear market.  “I think it presents a lot of opportunity from a venture perspective. I don’t say this opportunistically,” Klocanas said. “Objectively, crypto valuations and just valuations at large were a little crazy last year. Things have come back down to earth a little.”  “We just went through a monumental hype and partial adoption phase and some of that adoption will fade because it’s people who are just here for the bull market and might get flushed out and lose interest when things temper down,” he added.

NBD comes out of the gate with several projects that deal with ""hosted channels"" on the Lightning Network, a layer 2 network that helps make bitcoin transactions faster and cheaper. Hosted channels are network connections that don’t require users to pony up bitcoins before making Lightning transactions.  Read more: THNDR Games Launches Play-to-Earn Bitcoin Solitaire Mobile Game  The NBD initiative will allow other Bitcoin developers to build their own software instead of relying on third-party, for-profit services, such as ZEBEDEE itself.  ""NBD does not sell anything, it does not offer services, it does not support products. It just writes code and gives it to the world to do with it as they will,"" said Andre Neves, co-founder and chief technology officer of ZEBEDEE, in a press release provided to CoinDesk.  First wave of projects  NBD's first four projects deal with hosted channels. Over time, the organization's open-source development efforts will branch out to include other aspects of Bitcoin. The four projects are:  Open Bitcoin Wallet (OBW) is an advanced bitcoin Lightning wallet with support for hosted channels. It's noncustodial, meaning users controls their own keys and therefore control their own bitcoins. Those three key features (Lightning compatibility, support for hosted channels and being non-custodial) are what make it different from other wallets, the company said.  Poncho is a plugin that allows Lightning nodes (computers on the Lightning Network) to run and serve hosted channels for Lightning-compatible wallets. Poncho is a Core Lightning (CLN) software implementation, meaning Poncho is designed with specifications outlined in CLN.  Cliche is software program that lets developers create Lightning nodes with built-in support for hosted channels.  Immortan allows wallet developers to add Lightning features to their wallets in a ""plug-and-play"" fashion. The project is a software library, or a collection of programming tools, similar to the popular Lightning Development Kit (LDK).

42421234,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhqt3,1665758403,A Hack to Make Solar Energy More Available,"Spark began a year and a half ago with a clear goal: to accelerate the deployment of solar plants around the world. How to accomplish this wasn’t quite clear, however. After a few pivots, Spark’s founder Jon Ruth is now focused on building a marketplace for all parties to buy renewable energy certificates on the blockchain as a way to subsidize small producers of solar energy.  “Certain small power producers don’t have access to traditional markets for these certificates,” said Ruth. “We thought it would be interesting to look at building a tool to connect to small solar power producers, monitor their activity and mint.”  Spark is a finalist in CoinDesk's Web3athon. The winners are announced at the I.D.E.A.S. conference October 18 and 19.  Spark focuses on areas where solar is expensive and small producers struggle. A small producer in the solar world has an output of fewer than 500 kilowatts. Ruth is focused on producers of around 10 kilowatts.  Ruth comes to this project, which is part of CoinDesk’s 2022 Web3athon, with a background in solar energy and renewables, having built large-scale solar power plants for the last decade. In 2021, his research led him to think about solar energy applications in blockchain technology.“ There was enough of a toolbox of tools [in blockchain] to wonder what we can build with this stuff instead of more crap tokens,” he said. “If that’s all we’re going to do with it, then what’s the point?” If the invention of blockchain technology did not have real world applications other than “numbers go up,” Ruth said he would consider it a failure.  He furthered his research and started to ask questions: “If we give permission to make money, what does it mean to make money backed by solar energy? What does it mean to have currencies where value is in the great things happening in the world?”  See also: DIMO Helps Drivers Gain and Monetize Their Car Data  In his nearly two decades as an environmentalist, “no movement that has tried to push the government to do things has made a meaningful difference,” Ruth said.  Because government is not the answer, Ruth feels strongly that people and private enterprise have to come up with the solutions on their own. The clock is ticking, he said, and humans may have just a decade to make a meaningful impact to slow or reverse climate change. “Earth is in trouble. Humanity is in trouble if we don’t solve these problems.”  Aside from a couple of advisers, Spark is a one-man show right now. But one of his advisers is Tricia Wang, co-founder of Crypto Research and Design Lab, or CRADL, a consultancy focused on personal data, blockchain and crypto and blockchain accessibility. (Ed. note: Wang is the designer of the Web3athon, but did not advise Ruth on his project nor judge the competition. She will be presenting the Web3athon awards.)  Ruth’s goal for the Web3athon was to build a tool to monitor electricity generated from solar energy projects and provide the project owners with a way to create renewable-energy certificates that are saved on the Filecoin blockchain.  The Web3athon has been a heavy lift, technologically. Ruth is not a developer himself but after some late nights with his technical adviser – Harper Reed, CEO of enterprise developer General Galactic Corp. – who made recommendations for no-code tools, Ruth built everything that Spark submitted in this application.  The Web3athon was designed to welcome non-technical organizations. “Honestly, the Web3athon is the first hackathon I've felt welcome to as a non-developer,” said Ruth, who added that the kickoff conversations with all the participants were about the impact these projects would make, not the technical codes.  His key takeaway is that he now has the confidence to turn an idea into a working prototype. That said, the work on Spark’s proof of concept became more challenging once the project became a finalist. “I will need tech help in the future,” said Ruth.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | RESEARCH,Jeanhee Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/10/14/a-hack-to-make-solar-energy-more-available,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d3d305dfbb040ec488c5e986db12bcb405f2611b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That was (more or less) the title of a popular 2017 article by Edward W. Felten, a professor of computer science at Princeton University. The title shocks most people the first time they see it, but misnomers like “smart contracts” are commonplace in crypto. (Another one is “wallets” because crypto wallets don’t store money; they merely manage cryptographic keys.)  This article is part of CoinDesk's ""I.D.E.A.S. Week."" Register here to become a part of the Investing in Digital Enterprises and Assets Summit (I.D.E.A.S.), a new conference focused on the innovations happening across digital assets, Web3, blockchain and the metaverse.  So what are smart contracts? “We don’t really have a formalized definition for ‘smart contract.’ But informally we do know what a smart contract is. It’s a program that executes on the blockchain,” explains Jason Teutsch, founder of Truebit, a smart contract computational tool.  Why do smart contracts matter?  If a smart contract is just another computer program, why all the hullabaloo? What makes a decentralized finance (DeFi) app different from your bank’s online banking app? And what do investors need to know?  “It not only processes data, but also value. And that’s what makes it different from a traditional computer which only processes data. A smart contract can process money in a trustless way,” Teutsch explains.  Read more: How Do Ethereum Smart Contracts Work?  History of use cases  Nick Szabo coined the term “smart contract” in 1994. One of his theoretical use cases was a “smart lien protocol” for repossessing leased vehicles from deadbeats.  “We can create a smart lien protocol: If the owner fails to make payments, the smart contract invokes the lien protocol, which returns control of the car keys to the bank. This protocol might be much cheaper and more effective than a repo man,” Szabo wrote in 1997.  Eighteen years after Szabo’s musings, Ethereum, the world’s first smart contract platform, was launched. Ethereum’s first uber-successful smart contract use case wasn’t an automated repo man, it was a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) – an automated entity governed by programmable rules – aptly named, “The DAO.”  The DAO was essentially a decentralized venture fund. It was financed by the largest crowdfunding event in history at the time – $150 million. The DAO was eventually hacked for 3.6 million ether (currently about $5 billion), damping the excitement around DAOs for years.  Read more: The DAO Attacked: Code Issue Leads to $60 Million Ether Theft  But the DAO’s crowdfunding success highlighted another use case – initial coin offerings (funding a venture by minting a token that’s sold to investors in exchange for a more liquid token). Initial coin offerings (ICOs) peaked in 2017, raising nearly $5.4 billion across 342 ICOs.  This time, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was the party pooper. It released an investigative report warning the crypto community that sales of digital tokens would be “subject to the requirements of the federal securities laws."" That report likely played a role in the chain of events that eventually led to the notorious crypto winter of 2018.  Current use cases  Right before the 2018 crypto winter, non-fungible tokens (scarce and unique digital assets) like CryptoKitties and DeFi platforms like MakerDAO, started picking up steam on Ethereum. Today, NFTs and DeFi dominate many smart contract platforms (although we’re still in the wake of several major DeFi implosions).  Ethereum is no longer the only game in town. Solana, Avalanche, Polkadot and Binance Smart Chain are the new kids on the block (but not the only ones).  “What we’re seeing is that with NFTs a lot of startups are focusing on the Solana ecosystem and, behind that, Ethereum layer one or Polygon. We saw some interest in Avalanche last year, but that seems to be migrating back to Ethereum these days,” says Nic Carter, general partner at Castle Island Ventures, a venture capital firm focused exclusively on public blockchains.  Multiple billion-dollar DeFi shenanigans have created a need for DeFi insurance products. One new player in that area is DeFi insurance provider, Solace.  ""DeFi'ed insurance is a great idea and I’m excited to see where this product goes,"" said attorney Mark Billion in Solace’s press release. “But the jury is out on what is covered, and what a policy holder can do in the event that they disagree with any given outcome,"" warned Billion.  DAOs have made a comeback. ShapeShift, a popular cryptocurrency exchange, became a DAO last year.  Read more: ShapeShift to Shut Down, Airdrop FOX Tokens to Decentralize Itself Out of Existence  “DAOs are emerging from their trough of disillusionment. They are dynamic, they are non-jurisdictional, and they are shockingly powerful. They have no center. They rely on no bank account. They demonstrate anti-fragile, emergent order,” tweeted Erik Voorhees, founder of ShapeShift.  Future use cases  With the number of smart contract platforms growing, and only a handful of use cases flourishing, how much of the $22.5 trillion traditional financial services market can smart contract platforms garner? If we already have DAO venture funds, exchanges and DeFi insurance companies, what can we expect next? Full-service DAO banks, anyone?  “Digital assets have always been a part of our long-term strategy. We are beyond excited to have the ability to offer tightly integrated bank and cryptocurrency services to our customers and Fintech partners,” said Brad Scrivner, president and CEO of Vast Bank, in a statement.  Vast Bank introduced crypto purchases in its banking app last year, but it’s certainly not a full-service DAO bank. Banking is a tightly regulated industry, so going from traditional to DAO banking will likely be a gradual evolution (if it ever happens). It’s also unlikely that all banks will become DAOs, so the future landscape will probably have a diverse roster.  But no matter how you look at it, banking is an $8.58 trillion sector and out of all potential use cases in financial services, it might just be the next big gold mine for smart contract platforms.

In a resignation statement posted on Twitter, Kwarteng said it had been an “honor to serve,” albeit he did so for only 38 days. His departure leaves the fate of draft laws to regulate stablecoins in the hands of former Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt, who was named to replace Kwarteng shortly after.  Hunt is chairman of the House of Commons’ health-care committee. He had previously served as minister responsible for health and culture. That position included responsibility for digital policy. In 2019, while standing in the leadership contest to replace Theresa May as prime minister – which Boris Johnson eventually won – Hunt said he was a “tech entrepreneur” who wanted to make the U.K. the next Silicon Valley-style innovation hub.  The Financial Services and Markets Bill includes measures to give legal status to stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies tethered to the value of other assets like gold or the U.S. dollar. The bill was first announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak in April as he sought to make the country a crypto hub, and shortly before he resigned in protest over a series of scandals plaguing Johnson, who was prime minister then.  The bill was published in July under Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi, and was first debated in Parliament the day after Kwarteng was appointed in September.  While the bill was scheduled to be debated in the House of Commons committee next Wednesday, its fate is now unclear. So, indeed, is the fate of Truss, who appears set to reverse course on the corporation tax cuts that formed the centerpiece of her leadership campaign against Sunak.

The hack dates back to 2018 and involved an elaborate SIM-swap scheme that targeted mobile operator AT&T (T), which ultimately resulted in Terpin losing cryptocurrencies worth $24 million. SIM swapping is a way of bypassing two-factor authentication using mobile operators to break into sensitive websites like crypto exchanges and online banking.  Pinsky, who was 15 and a 10th-grader at Irvington High School in suburban New York at the time of the hack, confirmed his direct involvement in the SIM swap and subsequent theft, according to the court filing, which has been signed by both Terpin and the hacker. A detailed account of how the AT&T SIM-swap occurred will also be provided by Pinsky.  Terpin's attorney, Tim Toohey, said that he hopes that with that detailed information AT&T will take responsibility for security failures that led to the breach.  In 2020, a California judge dismissed a punitive damages claim against AT&T from Terpin. The court said the claim can be put back after discovery, with the case set to go ahead at Los Angeles federal court in May 2023.  All remaining claims against the hacker, other than the New York state law claim for conversion, will be dismissed.  UPDATE (Oct. 14, 2022, 12:15 UTC): Adds current age of hacker.

The end of Stronghold's deal with Northern Data will eliminate all profit sharing obligations, which it estimates would have been $10 million-$25 million (depending on the price of bitcoin) until September 2024, according to a statement on Friday. The cash outflow under the previous deal would be about 35% of miner revenue, net of a $0.027 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in power costs, according to the statement. On top of that, Stronghold is absolved of about $2.6 million payable to Northern Data.  Hosting is a service that data centers provide to crypto miners so that customers, such as Stronghold, can store their mining rigs and mine their preferred digital assets for a fee or profit sharing without having to build the accompanying infrastructure themselves. Norther Data both self-mines bitcoin and operates data center for hosting other miners.  The troubles for Stronghold started earlier this year, when it failed to meet Wall Street's earnings expectations and slashed its own hashrate expectation for 2022. Since then, challenges for the company continued to mount as both crypto and equity markets kept falling. However, the miner has been actively trying to strengthen its balance sheet and turn around the company by restructuring its debt, cutting costs and raising capital. The miner said in a presentation on Friday, that it has also lowered the principle amount of its debt burden by nearly 60% since May to $59.1 million.  Read more: Bitcoin Miner Stronghold Digital Significantly Restructures Debt  The termination of the deal provides Stronghold ""with improved operational control of our bitcoin operations"" and a ""material uplift"" to cash flow generation for the next two years, as well as optionality, said co-chairman and CEO Greg Beard in the statement. ""Overall, we believe that we continue to make significant progress towards improving our balance sheet, liquidity and cost structure to deliver shareholder value,” he added.  Under the terms, Stronghold will also gain the right to operate about 50 megawatts (MW) worth of Northern Data's bitcoin mining containers for $1,000 per year for two years, and will retain the option to buy the containers at the end of the term for somewhere between $2 million and $6 million.  In return for the termination of the deal, Stronghold has to pay Northern Data $2 million, on top of $2.5 million which it has already given to its hosting partner. The miner has previously returned 2,675 mining machines to Northern Data, which eliminates Stronghold's obligation to pay about $8.8 million to the data center operator.  Stronghold has also managed to extinguish $65 million in loan obligations under a previous deal with lender NYDIG to hand over 26,000 mining rigs in exchange for debt relief, the firm said in the presentation. Another $2 million will be written off as soon as Bitmain mining rigs are released from customs, the presentation said. The miner expects they could buy these machines for under $40 million at current market prices, which have fallen sharply this year.  Stronghold has been struggling, along with other bitcoin miners, amid a low bitcoin price and high energy prices. The mining industry has been looking to cut costs and keep their heads above water this year as bitcoin has lost more than 50% of its value. The shares of the miner have fallen about 93% this year, while the stocks of the larger bitcoin miners such as Marathon Digital (MARA), Riot Blockchain (RIOT) and Core Scientific (CORZ) have all lost more than 70% of their value.  Northern Data has also had a challenging year and said it will be dropping hosting clients as self-mining has been more profitable and predictable for the company, in a Sept. 19 letter to shareholders. The firm also slashed its year-end mining rig deployment expectation by more than half to a maximum of 42,000 and announced a ""tighter investment strategy.""

42394600,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUePS,1665741722,"Regulators Need Power to Take Down Foreign Crypto Sites, IOSCO Says","Securities regulators should have the power to demand foreign crypto sites be taken down, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) said in a Wednesday report.  The proposals from the standard setter are the latest in a series of crypto crackdowns based on worries about money laundering, tax evasion, financial stability and the rise in financial advice dished out by novel sources like social-media influencers.  Apps use techniques taken from mobile games to trick people into buying inappropriate financial products, and financial influencers, also known as ""finfluencers,"" offer investment advice without the correct license, IOSCO also warned. Last week, reality TV star Kim Kardashian agreed to pay $1.26 million to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that she hyped the EthereumMax token on Instagram without disclosing that she was paid to do so.  Financial services are going online and rulemakers need to adapt, the report said. The Madrid-based organization, whose members include the U.S. SEC and counterparts from across the world, said crypto can be particularly opaque and volatile.  “Digital fraudsters can hide behind a 'digital veil' that makes it difficult for regulators to locate, identify and take action against them,” IOSCO Secretary General Martin Moloney said in a statement published alongside the guidance.  Read more: International Securities Regulator IOSCO to Focus on Global DeFi, Crypto Rules  Crypto products can bamboozle investors while escaping regulations that apply to conventional finance products like stocks, the report said. Yet IOSCO thinks it has found a way to get around the problem of international crypto marketing, where sales targeted in a country like the U.S. might actually originate from a different country.  “New collaboration mechanisms may be developed to help ensure that the home regulator of wrongdoers undertake actions to stop online illegal activities (including crypto asset-related misconduct) upon request of the foreign regulator that has ascertained a violation,” the report said.  That could mean, say, the SEC asking a foreign authority to shut down or block access to illegal websites or social-media pages, to cease trades or to recover fines imposed on an overseas crypto site, the report added.  IOSCO’s report comes in the same week as the Financial Stability Board, another international standard setter, called for a comprehensive international crypto rulebook, limiting crypto companies’ ability to escape regulation by picking the easiest jurisdiction.

42394617,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUei9,1665740621,Bitcoin Unlikely to See Notable Recovery After Thursday's Short Squeeze: Traders,"Bitcoin (BTC) chalked up a dramatic rebound late Thursday, defying consensus for a continued slide in the wake of hotter-than-expected U.S. consumer price index data.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell to a four-month low of $18,140 on major exchanges in a knee-jerk reaction to the data, only to climb all the way back to $19,500, mimicking the drop and pop in the U.S. stocks. Prices nearly tested $20,000 a couple of hours before press time.  The unexpected post-data surge supposedly fueled by the unwinding of shorts or bearish trades has brought back the ""rocket emojis"" on Crypto Twitter, a sign of renewed bullish sentiment.  Industry experts, however, aren't sure if the overnight recovery has legs.  ""I see no fundamental change in the state of the world to suggest a sustainable recovery just yet,"" Ilan Solot, a partner at the Tagus Capital Multi-Strategy Fund, said. ""Both the macroeconomic and geopolitical outlook remain very unfavorable, and there are no signs that the Fed might ease off tightening in the near term.""  Money markets now expect the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike cycle to peak near 5%, a significant upward revision from the terminal rate of 4.65% priced ahead of the inflation report.  According to ING, Wells Fargo and other investment banks, Thursday's inflation data has confirmed a 75 basis point (0.75 percentage point) rate increase at the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Nov. 2.  ""Broad-based price increases in core services categories, coupled with still-brisk labor market activity, suggest that the Fed could front load rate hikes by more than previously thought at the early November FOMC,"" analysts at CIBC said in a note to clients, referring to the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.  Therefore, the bounce in both equities and bitcoin could be fleeting. The Fed has raised rates by 300 basis points this year, and yet core inflation, which strips out the volatile food and energy component, rose to a 40-year high in September. However, the so-called liquidity tightening has wrecked risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.  The ""Fed [is] now expected to hike more than pre-CPI (Consumer Price Index), which certainly indicates this is another example of a bear market rally,"" David Belle, founder of Macrodesiac.com and U.K. growth director at TradingView, said, adding that ""buy-the-dip mentality remains ingrained.""  Dip buyers have not had any success over the past three months, with the rising bond yields offering a reality check to risky assets occasionally buoyed by short covering or hopes of a Fed pivot.  And bonds may do so again. The yield on the two-year U.S. Treasury note, which is sensitive to rate hike expectations, rose nearly 20 basis points to 4.48% following Thursday's CPI release and remained elevated near 4.43% at press time.  That's a sign that the bond market doesn't expect a significant change in the Fed policy or inflation anytime soon.  ""I still can't find a convincing case to buy into this [equity market] weakness and have no intention of trying to 'catch a falling knife' any time soon,"" Michael Brown, head of market intelligence at Caxton, a global hedge fund, wrote in a daily market view, taking note of the post-CPI rise in bond yields.  ""In contrast, I remain bullish on the USD,"" Brown added. The dollar index one of the biggest nemesis of bitcoin.  Stack Funds Chief Operating Officer and co-founder Matthew Dibb said bitcoin needs to clear higher resistance levels to confirm a change in the trend.  Since mid-August, the bulls have repeatedly failed to secure a foothold above the 100-day simple moving average and the Ichimoku cloud.  ""Resistance is defined by the daily cloud,"" Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner at Fairlead Strategies, said in an email.  Therefore, it may be premature to call a bottom while these resistance levels are intact.

The Home Office Department, which is the government arm responsible for immigration and crime, wants to mirror planned amendments to the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency bill – that will make it easier for authorities to seize crypto involved in crime – in the U.K. Terrorism Act 2000 and the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001.  “This is to ensure that our law enforcement agencies, including counter-terrorism policing, have all the necessary powers to effectively seize, freeze and forfeit crypto assets that could be or have been used for terrorist purposes,"" a spokesperson for the Home Office said in an email to CoinDesk.  The Economic Crime and Transparency bill was introduced last month and targets the use of crypto for criminal activities including avoiding sanctions such as those placed on Russia over the war in Ukraine. Mirroring these measures in the country's counter-terrorism rules gives authorities the power to freeze assets in cases like the arrest of U.K. national Hisham Chaudhary who was found guilty of using bitcoin to help fund the Islamic State.  ""Crypto assets are increasingly being used for malign and terrorist purposes and we intend to crack down on this and we'll be bringing forward a government amendment to mirror the changes in part four of this bill into counterterrorism legislation,"" said Suella Braverman, secretary of state for the Home Department, at the second reading of the economic crime bill on Thursday.  While planning a crackdown on crypto used for illicit activities, the U.K. has also introduced bills to attract more crypto businesses to the country. The Financial Services and Markets bill, which will give regulators in the country more powers to regulate crypto, is currently being discussed in Parliament.

42394602,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUeSP,1665738726,Uniswap to Deploy on Privacy-Focused zkSync Following Community Vote,"Decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap will soon be deployed on privacy-focused layer 2 tool zkSync following the completion of a governance vote.  Uniswap is a smart contracts-based crypto exchange whose governance token, UNI, allows users to trade, supply and borrow assets. zkSync, on the other hand, uses a novel technology called ZK Rollups to offer a privacy-focused scaling product that enables faster transactions at lower fees.  The proposal was put forth to the community by Matter Labs, which develops and maintains zkSync.  The firm said the zkSync ecosystem has more than 100 projects committed to launching on its main network, including top decentralized-finance (DeFi) platforms, infrastructure products and on/off ramps.  Matter Labs added that deploying Uniswap on zkSync will help get new users onboard and increase user activity on Uniswap by offering lower transaction fees than the Ethereum blockchain without compromising on security.  “There's significant value in Uniswap being available on an EVM-compatible ZK Rollup,” Matter Labs explained in its proposal, referring to Ethereum virtual machines. “Deploying early on zkSync helps solidify Uniswap's place as the number one DEX and a thought leader.”  The proposal passed with nearly 100% of all votes agreeing to deploy Uniswap on zkSync, with more than 72 million UNI tokens staked by users. Just 120 UNI were used to vote against the proposal, close to 0%.  zkSync has been on testnet since February and plans to launch its mainnet soon. In the proposal, developers stated that Uniswap’s launch on zkSync could occur in four to six weeks.  The move follows Uniswap Labs’ announcement on Thursday that it raised $165 million in a funding round that was led by Polychain Capital. The fresh capital will enable Uniswap to invest more in its web app and developer tools, NFT (non-fungible token) launch and move to support mobile users.",POSITIVE,UNI,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | UNI | ZK,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/10/14/uniswap-to-deploy-on-privacy-focused-zksync-following-community-vote,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7cb697e8f66775d5ebc70087f60688d11a9ec8e2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A New York Judge took the action despite Kyle Roche, crypto lawyer and founding partner of Roche Freedman, filing earlier to step away from his law firm's class action practice.  In August, whistleblower site Crypto Leaks published a series of damning videos, accusing Roche of weaponizing class-action lawsuits to collect sensitive information on various crypto companies. Roche had denied the allegations.  Roche had withdrawn from lawsuits involving Tether, Bitfinex, the Tron Foundation, HDR Global Trading (which operates as BitMEX), Nexo Capital, BAM Trading (which operates as Binance.US), Dfinity, and Solana Labs. Roche also withdrew from a class-action lawsuit against several universities.

Binance Pool has started a $500 million lending project for private and public miners. The miners will need to pledge security in the form of physical or digital assets for the loan, which will have a duration of 18-24 months.  Binance Pool recently opened a mining pool for ETHW, the forked version of Ethereum that retains the blockchain's original proof-of-work (PoW) underpinnings.  Binance isn't the only firm that is looking to support the struggling crypto mining industry, Jihan Wu, the founder of crypto mining rig-maker Bitmain, is also setting up a $250 million fund to purchase distressed assets from mining firms.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Maple Finance has also established a lending pool, with a 20% interest rate to provide miners with working capital. Crypto asset management firm Grayscale has formed its own investment vehicle to help investors take advantage of the low prices of bitcoin mining infrastructures. Grayscale is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), the parent company of CoinDesk.  The downturn in the crypto market and the transition of Ethereum to proof-of-stake (PoS) has hit miners hard. In late September, crypto miner Compute North filed for bankruptcy, with $500 million in outstanding debt owed to at least 200 creditors.  Publicly traded mining company Riot Blockchain (RIOT) is down 70% year to date, while Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) is down 65% for the same period.

The hotly anticipated Consumer Price Index (CPI) arrived hotter than expected, the type of reading that usually sends riskier assets spiraling down.  Instead, bitcoin did the reverse on Thursday, recovering from an early stumble to regain its now-familiar perch over $19,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which was recently up more than 2% and trading above $19,600, has been occupying a narrow band between $19,000 and $21,000 for much of the past month, hamstrung by concerns about untamable inflation and the rising prospect of a harsh recession.  ""What we saw today was the culmination of a month-long buildup in protection purchasing and build up in implied and realized volatility,"" Jon Campagna, head of trading and capital markets at crypto investment fund CoinFund, wrote to CoinDesk in an email.  Campagna noted the pronounced declines in bitcoin and ether one-day trading volumes from the previous night following the CPI report, and a ""similar dynamic"" in equities markets. ""The VIX (CBOE Volatility Index) actually declined 4.5%!"" he wrote. ""The CPI number was hot, but it was an expected level of hot. This caused a relief rally as the put protection was sold and books were adjusted to slightly increase risk.""  The 8.2% CPI, up 0.1% from last month's figure, and 6.6% core inflation reading, which does not include volatile food and energy prices, offered the latest reminder of inflation's stubbornness. Both readings represented four-decade highs.  Ether and other major altcoins followed bitcoin's Thursday pattern, plunging steeply before rapidly recovering lost ground. The second-largest crypto in market value was recently changing hands below $1,300, roughly flat from Wednesday, same time. GALA and DOT were among the day's big gainers, recently rising more than 3% and 2%, respectively. ADA sank slightly. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, recently increased by 0.52%.  Stocks  Crypto prices dovetailed with equity markets, which also sank early before rebounding with a vengeance, with the tech-focused Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average all climbing well over 2% to break six-day losing streaks as short-term sellers may have looked to benefit from recent plunges. The underlying conditions that have concerned markets, however, remain in full force, with the U.S. central bank now even more likely than pre-CPI to stay on course for another 75 basis point rate hike – or perhaps higher. Mortgage rates in the once-torrid housing market now stand at a two-decade high near 7%.  Meanwhile, at an Institute for International Finance (IIF) event on Wednesday, Jamie Dimon again called crypto tokens ""decentralized Ponzis"" even as he praised aspects of blockchain technology. The JPMorgan CEO has been among crypto's most prominent critics, intermittently voicing his concerns about security, even as his bank has been fined billions of dollars for its own violations of statutes.  In written comments to CoinDesk, Mark Connors, head researcher at Canadian digital asset firm 3iQ, said that today's activity had not changed the recent economic and investment backdrop. ""Lots of cross-currents,"" Connors wrote. ""Nothing resolved except that inflation is more persistent than expected.""  Connors added, perhaps optimistically, that bitcoin had been less volatile than the Nasdaq on Thursday. ""That is a material difference, and one we believe will persist as equities drop,"" he said.  He added: ""The recent outperformance of BTC and ETH in Q3 and today's lower volatility profile are NOT an accident. The tourists are gone from crypto, BTC is on the right side of the [halving], crypto regulation is accelerating – critical to Institutional adoption and equity risk is massively underestimated.""

Bitcoin and ether, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, have fallen over 70% from all-time highs in 2021. SOL has dropped over 85%. The steep declines have been antithetical to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies’ envisioned role as a hedge – similar to gold – against the real-world economy and popular financial instruments like stocks or bonds.  Crypto faithful have recently started questioning bitcoin’s hedging role as more speculative than real. But some traders, including Michael Wu, the co-founder of crypto trading firm Amber, have counter-argued that market dynamics explain recent falling prices instead of buyer sentiment.  “It is a bit early to say crypto failed as an investment hedge,” Wu, recently told CoinDesk. “Short-term correlations say more about overall liquidity conditions, as we are on a rate-hiking cycle and supply-demand dynamics as most crypto investors are also tech investors and had to reduce their portfolio across the board, rather than fundamental drivers.”  Wu added: “Bitcoin is still a better form of storage of value than anything else that existed before, and Ethereum, along with the decentralized digital economy being built upon it, offers tremendous value as a tech infrastructure investment,” Wu said. He stressed the “need to be more patient” to see the value propositions of alternative currencies play out over the next few years or even decades.  Wu and similar types of investors are taking a long-term approach toward cryptocurrency investments that actively avoid chasing short-term movements and instead embrace a structural shift from traditional finance to the crypto ecosystem.  “If we zoom out beyond the short-term trading horizon which crypto folks are too used to focusing on and look at the long-term structural trends, we will see that the fundamental investment values in crypto as an asset class have continuously become stronger and stronger over time,” Wu said.

42394614,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUefC,1665712239,Crypto Trading Firm NYDIG Lays Off About 33% of Staff,"Bitcoin services company NYDIG has laid off around 100 people, according to four people familiar with the matter.  The firm has cut approximately 30% of staff in the past several weeks, according to three people familiar with the matter. The layoffs had been going on for “several weeks,” one person added. The Wall Street Journal first reported the layoffs late Thursday, putting the figure at 110 employees.  “It’s like a trading desk mentality where nobody talks to anyone,” a former NYDIG employee told CoinDesk. “You can disappear and nobody will know for months.”  A spokesperson for NYDIG previously declined to comment.  In late 2021, NYDIG raised $1 billion in funding to build an institutional-grade bitcoin platform. The platform was expected to connect to banks and credit unions, bringing unprecedented bitcoin access to large swaths of retail banking customers. The company branded the campaign “Bitcoin for all.”  But since NYDIG’s fundraise, the crypto market has soured. The price of bitcoin fell to under $20,000 a coin, a 70% decline from its November 2021 all-time high of about $67,500.  “NYDIG put all their eggs in this banking strategy, but they realized that there was no way that these banks were ready,” the former employee told CoinDesk. “They blew through all this money telling a story that they would bring bitcoin to the masses. Their core strategy was blundered.”  The layoffs also come amid leadership shuffles. In early October, the company announced CEO Robert Gutmann and President Yan Zhao would be stepping down and returning to Stone Ridge Holdings Group, the parent company of NYDIG. Tejas Shah and Nate Conrad, both executives at NYDIG, would take over as CEO and president, respectively.  Gutmann and Zhao are both co-founders of Stone Ridge, an alternative asset manager that specializes in niche investment strategies, including weather reinsurance and drug royalties.
