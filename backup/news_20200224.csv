42383335,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vHPr,1582585286,Justin Sun Bought Steemit. Steem Moved to Limit His Power,"The people who run the Steem blockchain executed a reversible soft fork Sunday, stopping one of the largest piles of tokens from voting. The move comes days after Justin Sun’s Tron Foundation acquired Steemit, the blockchain’s most prominent app.      The protective measure is a striking one in the cryptocurrency space and illustrates some of the thought-provoking realities of delegated governance.      The blog post describing the fork describes the involvement of a well-resourced entity as potentially very exciting. But its authors were quick to qualify:    ""In these early stages the most important task for witnesses [Steem’s version of bitcoin miners or EOS block producers] is to ensure the security of the Steem blockchain. To this end, we have updated to a temporary protective protocol to maintain the status quo currently established in regards to Steemit Inc's stake and its intended usage.""    Steem is a delegated proof-of-stake blockchain (DPoS), much like EOS, which means a smaller number of decisionmakers are needed to coordinate in order to counter a major new stakeholder. The community deemed action necessary because Steemit owns a giant pile of tokens that could be used to take over the blockchain, though the pool has never previously voted. It is believed that Sun, a savvy marketer and controversial figure in the industry, now owns that giant pile.      From here out, things start to get pretty confusing.      When the soft fork was executed, the network’s validators, called witnesses, blocked STEEM held by a limited set of accounts from voting on who governs the network and participating in other ways that might allow it to seize control. Within the community, this pool of tokens is known as the ""Steemit Inc ninja-mined stake.”      As far as we can tell, the fund amounts to something like a founders reward or pre-mine on most other similar blockchains. Sources tell CoinDesk the ninja stake could potentially represent something like 20 percent of the current supply, which would apparently make it a decisive voting bloc.      As the post about the soft fork notes, ""There have been a lot of uncertainties around [Steemit Inc] and its continued use of the assets it controls.""      Steemit's holdings have always been a source of tension between Steem and Steemit, but as long as co-founder Ned Scott ran Steemit the community felt relatively comfortable he would not intervene in governance. The ninja stake was meant to be used to grow the network. With a new owner, the group is less sure.      The move prompted a response from Sun, who wrote Sunday night, ""We have so much to work to do to make Steemit.com the power that it really can be."" He went on to list plans for incorporating Tron's various cryptocurrencies, getting STEEM tokens onto more exchanges and getting influencers onto the blogging site.      Sun is organizing a summit called STEEMit 2.0 Town Hall for March 6, inviting the top 50 witnesses to take part, according to the post. A key question for that meeting will no doubt be what Tron intends to offer in terms of a token swap between STEEM and TRX, a question that has only been floated abstractly so far.      Ned Scott and the Tron Foundation did not reply to a request for comment from CoinDesk.      The announcement of Steemit's acquisition did not specifically address the company's holdings of cryptocurrency, so it is as yet unknown if all of it went to Tron in the deal.      How Steem works    Steemit, a blogging site that works somewhat like a cross between Reddit and Medium, is the most well-known app on the Steem blockchain.      Besides Steemit, there are many more decentralized apps that run on the blockchain. Steemit Inc. only owns Steemit, but it is the most influential.      Steemit relies on Steem to track its users and also assess their clout on its network. Content that does well on Steemit shares in a small portion of the blockchain's new emission of tokens.      The current supply of STEEM, as of this writing, is 373,442,235, according to Steemd.com, a block explorer.      Steem has three different tokens: Steem, Steem Power and Steem Dollars. Steem is the core token. Steem Power is created when users agree to lock up Steem, and it functions sort of like an ownership stake on the network. Steem Dollars is a stablecoin.      What makes Steem challenging is you never really know how much Steem Power there is in the world. It shrinks very slowly but it can increase quickly.      According to a longtime Steem community member, James Reidy, there are 210 million Steem Power in existence that could potential govern the chain. There could be as much as 340 million, if all STEEM were staked to vote.      Reidy estimated Steemit controls something like 68 million in Steem Power, ""but exact numbers are not known because they could have Steem and Steem Power in any number of unknown accounts,"" he told CoinDesk.      There are several times more witness candidates than there are witness slots available.      Reidy, who serves as a witness candidate but does not hold one of the top 20 spots (there are several times more witness candidates than there are witness slots available), told CoinDesk:    ""What the witnesses did, I believe, is best for the chain during this uncertain time. There were promises from SteemIt Inc. that the stake in question would be used for certain purposes to grow the ecosystem but, more importantly, that it would be non-voting stake. This was never enshrined in code. It's highly unlikely those promises transferred in the sale (why would they) so the witnesses moved to protect the chain until details can be agreed upon.""",NEUTRAL,TRX,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TRX | FORKS,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/24/justin-sun-bought-steemit-steem-moved-to-limit-his-power,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c7d8ca8a03e226ab1e9498209c3590d2bff532d4-829x553.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383344,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vHcR,1582581629,Secretive Digital Fiat Project Emerges With New Partner as CBDC Chatter Grows,"As central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) march into view, a privately run version of digital fiat is adding a key tech partner.      Utility Settlement Coin (USC), the blockchain-based payments system involving commercial and central banks, will be working with ConsenSys-backed startup Adhara, CoinDesk has learned. Adhara was behind Project Khokha, which used enterprise blockchain client Quorum to see how zero-knowledge proofs performed with the South African Reserve Bank (SARB).      The move is one of only a handful of public overtures by Fnality, the company that oversees the development of USC. Fnality raised $64.5 million in June 2019 from 14 shareholders including banking giants Barclays, Santander, BNY Mellon, ING and others.      “We think adding Adhara is going to really help us. They've got experience of doing some of this type of stuff in other places,” said Fnality CEO Rhomaios Ram.      The sensitive nature of Fnality’s discussions with central banks means it likes to keep a low profile. To date, USC’s only known technology partner was London-based Clearmatics Technologies. (Clearmatics, which uses a fork of ethereum, played a key part in the inception of USC, along with Swiss lender UBS, back in 2015.)      “At Fnality we are pursuing a multi-partner strategy,” Ram said. “Part of that is associated with risk and part of that is associated with we want more people involved in this ecosystem.”      The USC is commercial bank money, as opposed to a pure CBDC, which is issued and backed by the domestic central bank and carries sovereign risk. However, the design of USC allows it to carry some of the characteristics of central bank money because the cash collateral backing the USC is held at a domestic central bank.      As stated in a mandate to its shareholder commercial banks, Fnality’s plan is to represent five currencies on its blockchain – USD, euro, JPY, GBP and CAD – and solve the so-called “cash on ledger” problem, allowing wholesale banking transactions to happen instantly, cross-border and 24/7.      An industry source close to Fnality said adding Adhara makes sense because the work the startup has already done in South Africa could evolve into a Fnality payment system. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) was also mentioned by the source as a possible custodian of Fnality’s tokenized cash.      Asked if SARB was going to be in the cards when it comes to including more central banks within Fnality, Ram said: “We can't look ahead that far. Our mandate from our investors is to focus on the five [currencies] and then, depending on how successful we are with those five, we will come to the others as and when, depending on what our investors say at that time.”      Ram acknowledged CBDCs have risen on the agenda since his company’s June 2019 fundraising, adding that Fnality has held “very casual, informational conversations with some people,” but he had no idea what their intentions were or whether it was just educational.      Neither SARB nor SNB returned requests for comment.    The Libra effect    The landscape has changed dramatically regarding central banks and digital currencies thanks to Facebook’s audacious plans for its Libra stablecoin.      A key question for any large-scale, privately backed initiative in this area now is whether Libra is a good or a bad thing.      A positive scenario is that central banks now move more quickly on initiatives like USC; another possible outcome is the central banking fraternity actively discouraging private-sector experiments from encroaching any further into the territory of the state.      Ram agreed Libra cut both ways. “It was literally both good and bad,” he said. “It was good because obviously these types of things gather a lot of attention and people that didn't take us seriously before started to. But at some level, if you are not in the detail of this it all looks the same. That can be a good or bad thing.”      John Whelan, Santander Bank’s innovation chief who is also on the board of Fnality, said it was not a question of competing with CBDCs at all.      “We see these things as entirely complementary, and it's quite likely given the regulations and the impact potentially on monetary policy … that something like Fnality will come into existence [before CBDCs]. But they are totally compatible,” said Whelan.      In light of Libra, Ram was philosophical about possible outcomes for Fnality’s ambitious plan to tokenize fiat held in the coffers of major central banks.      “If the only thing that this [Libra] does is force the conversation and force some speed up on CBDCs – from a personal perspective that might not be great but from the investors' perspective that might still work for them [Fnality’s shareholder banks],” he said.    2020 vision    Fnality’s task, to create a regulatory framework and rulebook that five large central banks can digest, is ambitious in itself, nevermind coordinating the build of the various parts of the stack plus all the integration work that has to be done.      A second source familiar with the project said Fnality’s strategy regarding its contracting framework and execution plan seemed “quite confused.”      “Whenever you have a lot of people involved in something – and they've grown their headcount quite aggressively – if you don't have a clear program and execution plan at the beginning, there's a natural tendency to kind of end up going all over the place,” the source said.      Regarding the scale of the organizational challenge, Ram said: “That is kind of the special sauce of Fnality, organizing all of these different stakeholders. That’s what we are aiming to be good at – that and driving all the legal and regulatory.”      The plan announced with last year’s fundraising was to come out with one of the main five currencies on the network by the end of 2020.      “We have got no reason to change our minds yet. So all looks still possible,” Ram said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/24/secretive-digital-fiat-project-emerges-with-new-partner-as-cbdc-chatter-grows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/43211d99f6dc5761c4d6ccca476d4c6de377045b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383334,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vHOb,1582580025,Bitcoin's Coronavirus Sell-off Throws Cold Water on Safe-Haven Argument,"As U.S. stocks tumbled on Monday by the most in six months amid renewed coronavirus fears, bitcoin barely budged - at least in terms of the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency’s trading history.      Bitcoin (BTC) was down 4.6 percent as of 6:17 p.m. UTC (1:17 p.m. ET) to $9,517. But a decline of that magnitude represents merely the biggest drop since last week; already this year, bitcoin has suffered six other single-day losses of 3 percent or greater. And due to a powerful rally in recent months, the cryptocurrency’s price is still up about 32 percent in 2020.      Such a performance stands in stark contrast with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks, whose 3.6 percent plunge was the most for a single day since early August and wiped out investors’ gains for the year.      “There’s certainly a bit of fear in the bitcoin market, but it’s not anything close to the panic we’re seeing on Wall Street today, with the clear flight to safety,” said Mati Greenspan, founder of the analysis firm Quantum Economics, which specializes in cryptocurrencies and foreign exchange. “Three percent is a very different figure for stocks and for bitcoin.”      The episode could renew an ongoing debate among investors over whether bitcoin should trade as a risky asset like stocks and junk bonds, or if it’s more akin to a safe haven like gold or U.S. Treasury bonds. There’s also the possibility that it’s neither — in a category of its own and largely uncorrelated with traditional asset prices.      Indeed, the coronavirus wasn’t the only news potentially affecting bitcoin prices on Monday: Billionaire investor Warren Buffett asserted in a CNBC interview that he doesn’t own any cryptocurrency and “never will.”      The plunge in stocks came as authorities globally struggled to stem the spread of the coronavirus beyond China, raising concerns the global economy will suffer a bigger hit from quarantines and delays in international trade and travel, according to Bloomberg News. The epidemic has now spread to more than 30 countries, including South Korea, Italy and parts of the Middle East.      Traditional safe-haven assets like gold and U.S. government bonds rallied on Monday. Gold rose 1.7 percent to $1,676.50 a troy ounce, the highest in seven years. U.S. Treasuries rose, too, as the yield on the 10-year note declined by 0.11 percentage point to 1.36 percent. Bond prices move in the opposite direction from their yield.      A jump in bitcoin prices in January — after the U.S. killing of a top Iranian led to heightened concerns of geopolitical and economic turmoil — prompted some traders to speculate that the cryptocurrency might be gaining acceptance among investors as a safe haven.      But in a report last week, the Norwegian analysis firm Arcane Research noted bitcoin’s correlation with gold had weakened since the start of this year.      Greg Cipolaro, co-founder of the crypto-focused firm Digital Asset Research, said in an interview he recently studied bitcoin’s price performance over the past nine years on days when U.S. stocks experience big swings, defined as a price move that’s statistically two standard deviations away from average.      On the 13 times such daily moves occurred over the period, bitcoin’s price rose an average of 1.5 percent when stocks rallied. Bitcoin's price fell 0.34 percent when there was an unusually large selloff. Since 2011, bitcoin rose by 0.6 percent per day, on average.      “On these kinds of days where you have these risk-off scenarios, bitcoin tends to be down on the day,” Cipolaro said. “It’s not the same as owning Treasuries, and not the same as owning gold.”      The takeaway for the bitcoin market might still be positive, he said, since hedge funds and other large investors are often hunting for assets that are mostly uncorrelated with traditional markets but boast a track record of high risk-adjusted returns.      Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of the crypto-focused firm Arca Funds in Los Angeles, said in a phone interview that cryptocurrencies might be slower to react to global developments than stocks and bonds because they’re still largely disconnected from Wall Street; digital assets like bitcoin aren’t typically bought via traditional brokerage accounts.      “It's irresponsible for anyone to say that bitcoin is truly a safe haven,” Dorman said. “Look at how gold and Treasuries and equities react instantaneously to global fears. Bitcoin and digital asserts live outside that work flow.”      Federal Reserve officials led by Chair Jerome Powell have signaled recently they see the current stance of monetary policy as appropriate, but that the coronavirus could put the health of the global economy at risk. The implication is that the U.S. central bank might need to cut interest rates to stimulate markets and business activity if the contagion leads to a steeper-than-anticipated dropoff in growth.      Such monetary-policy easing might ultimately bolster the case for buying bitcoin, Dorman said, since many analysts believe that limits on the supply of new units of the cryptocurrency make it useful as a hedge against inflation.      “I don't expect bitcoin to trade as risk-on or risk-off asset,” he said. “But over a longer period of time, anything that's inflationary, or said another way devalues other currencies, strengthens the purchasing power of bitcoin.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/24/bitcoins-coronavirus-sell-off-throws-cold-water-on-safe-haven-argument,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c9383942becca429472c9cdd6d223e34eb190ee2-1266x666.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Assemblywoman Yvonne Lopez (D.-19) introduced the Digital Asset and Blockchain Technology Act Friday, putting forth a proposal to license any entity looking to provide digital asset trading, storage, purchase, sales, exchange, borrowing/lending or issuance services. The N.J. Department of Banking and Insurance would be tasked with overseeing this license and regulating businesses.      The term ""digital asset"" encompasses virtual currencies, digital securities and other assets, including anything with a transaction history recorded on ""a distributed, digital ledger or digital data structure in which consensus is achieved through a mathematically verifiable process.""      Under the terms of the proposed bill, individuals cannot conduct any business activity around digital assets unless they either have a license or have a reciprocal license in another state. Companies conducting business will also be required to make certain disclosures to customers.      The bill is framed as focusing on consumer protection, according to a press release.      ""We must take steps to protect consumers looking to invest in cryptocurrency, while also allowing the sector to continue to develop and expand in New Jersey,"" Lopez said in a statement.      She pointed to New York state's capital expenditure requirements, saying many small crypto businesses fled to New Jersey as a result.      In her statement, Lopez said it was important to ""establish fair and reasonable requirements"" for these businesses.      Still, welcoming emerging industries will ""keep our economy innovative and competitive,"" she said.      Individuals who fail to secure the license or do not have a pending license application will be fined $500 per day, beginning when the regulator ""issues a notice of failure"" and extending until the individuals file their applications.      New Jersey has yet to bring any comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation into law, but Governor Phil Murphy did sign a bill last year that would create a task force to study potential use cases for blockchain.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/24/new-jersey-lawmaker-wants-to-create-a-crypto-license,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7912f8af2cf1731212d8aac5aa93c6fbbde00c1e-1280x622.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The volume hit $118 million, the lowest level since Dec. 31. On that day futures recorded volume of $112 million, according to Skew Markets.       What’s worth noting is volumes have pulled back sharply from the multi-month highs registered on Feb. 18. CME traded $1.1 billion in volume this past Tuesday. That was the first above-$1 billion daily volume since June 27, 2019.       Bitcoin CME futures contracts, which went live in December 2017, have recorded above-$1 billion daily volume only three times.       While daily volume collapsed in the last three trading days of the previous week, open interest remained near the seven-month high of $338 million, registered on Feb. 14.       Open interest refers to the number of futures contracts outstanding on an official exchange at any one time, while volumeis the number of contracts traded in a given period.       A drop in volume accompanied by an elevated open interest is usually considered a sign of investors holding on to their positions. In such cases, the market usually extends the preceding move; bitcoin’s price rose over 50 percent from lows below $7,000 to $10,500 in the six and a half weeks to Feb. 18.       A rally like that is said to have legs since the price gain was backed by an increase in open interest and trading volume. In the first six weeks of the year, daily volumes increased from $176 million to $1.1 billion and open interest rose from $127 million to $338 million.       Bakkt open interest slides       Activity in bitcoin futures listed on Intercontinental Exchange’s Bakkt platform has cooled recently, with open interest plunging from a record high of $19 million down to $10 million in just seven days to Feb. 20.

Following a summit in the Saudi-Arabian capital Riyadh over the weekend, representatives from G-20 financial institutions pressed countries that have not done so already to align themselves with global cryptocurrency standards from the intergovernmental organization, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).      ""We urge countries to implement the recently adopted Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards on virtual assets and related providers,"" reads a joint-communique published after the summit.      Finalized in the summer, FATF's controversial ""travel rule"" requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs), including wallet providers and exchanges, to share user information with one another each and every time funds are transferred.      The recommendation is designed to prevent terrorists and money launderers using cryptocurrencies to bypass existing controls and sanctions. In June last year, the G-20 reaffirmed it would align with the new rules.      FATF recommendations are non-binding and give authorities some room to interpret new standards into local law. But countries that seriously diverge or do not adopt recommendations face being blacklisted, potentially cutting them off from crucial investment and global trade.      Many of FATF's 36 member-states, which include G-20 economies, have already adopted the travel rule. Both South Korea and Singapore have passed legislation that compels VASPs to comply with new anti-money laundering frameworks.      The EU's fifth anti-money laundering directive (5AMLD), which requires exchanges to register with local regulators and demonstrate compliance, came into force at the beginning of 2020.

42404067,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhFj9,1582556402,Blockchain Pioneer Caitlin Long to Build Crypto Bank in Wyoming,"The U.S. may soon get its first dedicated bank for digital assets.      A Wyoming corporation founded by blockchain legislative champion and Wall Street veteran Caitlin Long is preparing to apply for a special purpose depository institution (SPDI) charter with the state’s division of banking. The future bank is called Avanti, which means “forward” in Italian, and will be focused solely on providing regulated services for digital assets, Long announced Monday.      The company, formed on Jan. 6, has already raised $1 million in seed funding. Avanti will provide payment, custody, securities and commodities activities for institutional customers using digital assets.      While the company has yet to submit its application, it already has eight products in its pipeline that are not currently available in the U.S. market – the only named one being custody for security tokens. Because trust companies cannot custody securities under U.S. law, SPDIs are uniquely positioned to fill the gap.      Avanti’s balance sheet is planned to hold more assets under administration than deposits, and profits will be generated by providing services to institutional clients, similar to large traditional custody banks such as State Street, Bank of New York Mellon and Northern Trust. Long described the business as a “money warehouse.      The firm will custody digital assets without any change in the ownership of those assets, like a valet takes care of your car without being given its legal title, Long said.    Blockstream partnership    Under Wyoming state law, SPDI banks must keep all of customers’ fiat demand deposits as liquid assets and cannot lend. However, these entities get to operate under the regulatory oversight of the crypto-friendly Wyoming Division of Banking instead of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).      Avanti is partnering with bitcoin and blockchain technology startup Blockstream, which will provide bitcoin applications, as well as the software and hardware needed to custody digital assets. “Blockstream brings software for the bitcoin protocol. … Avanti brings a regulated delivery vehicle to deliver it into the USD markets,” Long said in an email.      With Blockstream’s Liquid – a ""sidechain"" or parallel network sometimes used to move money between exchanges – the company will able to develop a “one-stop shop” for digital asset custody, said Blockstream CEO and cofounder Adam Back.      With Blockstream, Avanti can build adjacent blockchain application programming interfaces (APIs) and conventional banking APIs, Back said. The first might look like an API that initiates multi-signature transactions; the second is usually an API that transfers money between traditional banking ledgers.      Long, who pushed for the creation of the SPDI charter, said she didn’t plan on forming an SPDI bank until last Christmas when she was visiting Rome. Prior to her trip, a group – which Long would not name – approached her about creating such an entity.      Because of the high capital level required to start an SPDI – around $25 million – many potential applicants have been slow to seek approval, even though the regulatory door been open since last October. Currently, the Wyoming Division of Banking has only received two applications, which the regulator is working with applicants to refine.      In Rome, Long had been talking to Back on the phone when she became convinced to start Avanti. (Back is a well-known cryptographer who regularly talked with Satoshi Nakamato during bitcoin’s (BTC) early days and was cited in Nakamoto’s bitcoin white paper for having created Hashcash, a predecessor technology that inspired the first cryptocurrency.)    When in Rome    The setting was appropriate. While they spoke, Long walked between the Imperial Forums and the Roman Forums. There she saw for the first time a rostra, a large platform for delivering speeches. “A symbol of decentralized power where citizens gathered to debate and engage in commerce voluntarily during the Republic,” she said.      With Back, she talked about the need for big money – pension funds, endowments, foundations, corporations and sovereign wealth funds – to have a regulated partner to deliver services around bitcoin.      “It’s a $300 billion asset class and they can’t ignore it anymore,” Long said. “Their existing service providers aren’t able to help them.”      That night she landed on the name Avanti.      “It’s a fitting name for a bank that’s moving ahead, while also anchored in the history of sound money and clear property rights,” she said.      Seeking perfection    Having finalized the requirements for applications, the Wyoming Division of Banking is now developing the policies and procedures for SPDI banks and defining how the regulator will perform its yearly examination and supervision processes. To do this, the regulator is speaking to other state banking regulators to ensure the charter can transport to other states.      “Wyoming is integrating digital assets into the U.S. banking system for the first time,” said Chris Land, general counsel at the state’s banking division. “The first applications that go through the process literally have to be perfect because many of the top financial industry officials in the country will be following the process. Perfection, like art, takes time.""      With ""a lot of trust placed in us by very important people,"" Land said that the process will not be rushed. ""Wyoming is a leader in responsible financial innovation, so we have to get this right,” he added.      The Wyoming legislature has several blockchain initiatives coming up later this year, including bills that would expand the blockchain task force into a select committee, provide First Amendment protections to code (as long as it isn’t written in a malicious way), and extend the SPDI charter’s field of service to include retail customers.      “It’s going to take a little while for folks to get their arms around all that we’ve done,” said Tyler Lindholm, a Wyoming state representative and chairman of the Wyoming Blockchain Task Force. “Blockstream being able to partner with Caitlin Long is a big win for them. Ms. Long knows the charting process. She knows financial regulation inside and out.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/24/blockchain-pioneer-caitlin-long-to-build-crypto-bank-in-wyoming,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/09fa71aae05808d2d2e491e29e2550124fdbca46-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404053,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhFYK,1582552800,SEC to Decide the Fate of Another Bitcoin ETF Proposal This Week,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is once again poised to approve or reject a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), when Wilshire Phoenix’s United States Bitcoin and Treasury Investment Trust meets a filing deadline Wednesday.      Wilshire Phoenix is the latest in a long line of companies hoping to secure SEC approval to list shares of a bitcoin-related ETF, and the only one that has an active application before the securities regulator. Such an instrument would allow retail investors to get exposure to the bitcoin market without what some see as the added difficulty of owning bitcoin itself, potentially boosting market participation by individuals wary of bitcoin’s stance as an unregulated investment.      While its chances are slim – the SEC has yet to approve any bitcoin ETF applications for a multitude of stated reasons – the company was filing updates to its proposal as recently as last week in efforts to bolster its application.      Wilshire managing partner William Herrmann told CoinDesk that he was optimistic about the filing, saying in a phone call last week that “we wouldn't have filed it if we didn't think that it would be approved.”      To boost its chances, the amended S-1 filed on Feb. 14 now includes an entire additional section on underwriters, though no specific entities are named. The filing also now includes Wilshire Phoenix’s maximum share price ($2,500), a number of shares it intends to register initially (8,040) (though this number is likely to change when the actual shares are being offered) and a note on the trust's fees (68 basis points).      The firm filed the ETF application in mid-2019, with the regulator repeatedly postponing any decision, leading to the final Feb. 26 deadline.      In rejecting ETFs previously, the SEC has pointed to concerns about market manipulation, the bitcoin market’s overall size and a need for surveillance-sharing agreements as some factors it considers.      Wilshire is attempting to address these concerns by composing its ETF with a basket that automatically rebalances itself between U.S. Treasury bonds and bitcoin in response to the cryptocurrency’s volatility. As volatility goes up, the basket favors bonds, and vice versa.      Herrmann previously told CoinDesk that in his view, this automatic rebalancing reduces the risk to investors.    What are the odds?    The SEC certainly appears to be paying attention to the filing. According to public documents, Commissioners Hester Peirce and Allison Herren Lee both met with representatives from Wilshire Phoenix, NYSE Arca and their law firms.      The Division of Trading and Markets met with representatives from the companies in January, as well as twice last year, to discuss the proposal. Still, the SEC’s thinking on the proposal remains opaque.      Wilshire’s Herrmann, reiterating a point often brought up in favor of bitcoin ETFs, told CoinDesk the product would allow a wider group of investors to safely access what is essentially a new asset class.      ""We want to provide easy access to strategies that are often only limited to institutions or accredited investors,” Herrmann said. “Restraining who is able to invest in any product or strategy on the basis of socioeconomic status or for any reason is simply wrong. This leaves many exposed to sudden market volatility followed by likely losses due to lack of diversification.”      The bitcoin ETF Wilshire has proposed is actually one in a larger family of such products. The company has also filed to issue a gold and Treasury-backed ETF.      Herrmann said he believes creating multiple investment strategies for consumers is a part of its overall strategy.      ""We're confident we will have the bitcoin ETF soon, and the gold ETF won't be far behind. We are aiming to launch a lot more products as well,” Herrmann said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/02/24/sec-to-decide-the-fate-of-another-bitcoin-etf-proposal-this-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d1fa36aa37caed4cda9344c2d32d9eda1127bd30-1500x861.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404062,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhFfD,1582549200,How to Protect Bitcoin for Your Heirs With the Push of a 'Dead Man's Button',"What happens to your bitcoin after you die?      This is more than just a philosophical question: It could involve a substantial amount of currency.      The question of crypto and the Great Beyond is what prompted about 20 or so developers to get together in London recently to experiment with repurposing the current lightning protocol to send private messages as a “dead man's button,” a system that can't be censored and would keep your crypto safe for your heirs.      Lightning Labs infrastructure engineer Joost Jager has been exploring using lightning for messaging over the past year. At the Advancing Bitcoin conference in London, Jager hosted a workshop to explore building a dead man's button with lightning. The mission was to show that lightning can be used as messaging system as well as a payment network.      These buttons are not new. At the workshop, Jager noted Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency whistleblower, used one in case he died before journalists could reveal the contents of the documents he wanted to make public.      The goal of the workshop was to explore one of lightning’s relatively new features, ""keysend"" (formerly known as spontaneous payments). It’s so experimental it isn't even described in the lightning specifications yet. But it does offer a way to send data (called ""custom records"" in LND, the lightning implementation Jager works on) along with a transaction.      Here’s how it might work: Imagine a user who wants to pass on a bitcoin (BTC) inheritance. That user would communicate with a ""service,"" pushing a ""button"" that would send a message every week or so to signify that the user is still alive.      If the button isn't pressed one week, it is assumed the bitcoin user is dead or incapacitated and it's time for the bitcoin to be passed on, at which point the service automatically dispenses a ""secret,"" which can be used to retrieve the crypto.      Beyond that, Jager thought some additional features should be added, even if they could make the program trickier to implement. The program should maintain the privacy of the sender and the receiver, he said, and should allow the sender to get proof the service still has the secret.      Developers split into small groups to think about how to build a service that would meet all of these and other goals. The workshop developers came up with some ideas, which Jager published to GitHub. He included a rough implementation, which puts several of the ideas into practice, though he said the code ""is extremely limited and does not implement everything described.""      This design isn't necessarily the best way forward, Jager said, but it's a proof of concept he hopes can inspire other implementations.      Imagination versus loss    Jager told CoinDesk the ""primary"" reason he chose the dead man's button for the workshop was it is complex enough of a use case that it can show off what lightning can do as a messaging system.      But he also thinks a dead man's button could be a real use case for lightning down the road.      ""Many people try to arrange their crypto inheritance and need to make up their minds about who they trust. This could be an alternative, assuming that wrinkles are ironed out and the whole process is hidden underneath a user-friendly shell,"" he said. This is ""unlikely to happen short term, but I hope people see the possibilities.""      Lawyer Pamela Morgan, an expert on crypto inheritance and author of a book dedicated to helping people develop a plan to pass on their crypto, agrees with Jager the technology is far from ready. But she said she would not encourage users to put any money into any experimental dead man's button systems just yet.      ""Dead man's switches are fun projects that excite our imaginations but fail to solve the complex and multidisciplinary challenges of crypto asset inheritance distribution. Relying on such solutions for something as important as inheritance is likely to cause catastrophic loss,"" she told CoinDesk.      However, she said the technology has promise. Since few crypto enthusiasts have any sort of a plan for what to do with their currencies after they are gone, she's happy to see people exploring ways to make crypto inheritance a more common practice.      ""If adding a dead man's switch makes more people actually do inheritance planning for their bitcoin, then I'm all for it because so few people actually do anything,"" she told CoinDesk.      In the meantime, Jager is pressing on with beefing up lightning's messaging system to make it easier to send messages across the network.

42404057,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhFbH,1582546800,"Blockchain Can Help UK Savers Recover $48B in Unclaimed Pensions, Says R3","Distributed ledger tech provider R3 says it's providing pension firms with the technology to build new blockchain-based identity solutions that could help savers reclaim some of the $48 billion in lost U.K. pension pots.      According to Abbas Ali, the head of the New York firm's digital identity unit, pension providers will be releasing their own solutions that leverage the R3 tech throughout 2020.      More than 33 million people in the U.K. have a pension. But in a study by advice firm Profile Pensions this year, 24 percent of respondents said they had likely lost track of one of their pensions.      Estimating that there are more than 1.6 million lost pension pots nationwide, each with an average value of £23,000, the study concluded there could be as much as £37 billion (approximately US$47.8 billion) worth of unclaimed pensions in the U.K. alone.      This isn't just a British problem. The Australian Tax Office estimated that $17.5 billion AUD ($11.3 billion) lay in unclaimed pension pots in 2017–2018. In 2013, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) said there was more than $58 billion in unclaimed pensions in the U.S.      In R3's view, the problem boils down to identity.      ""One of the biggest and most costly exercises in pension funds is identifying the user ... and verifying each year that the user is still alive and entitled to these funds and managing the process,"" Ali said.      Many pension providers have little option but to verify pension holders' identities by mailing documents to their last known address or even requesting holders present themselves for registration, he said.      As a verification system, it's full of holes. Through ill-health, commitments or distance, many people won't be able to show up at an office so easily. Some are simply no-shows. If users fail to disclose a forwarding address, the pension provider may have lost its only way of contacting them.    Putting users in control    Blockchain could create a whole new dynamic, Ali said.      ""We've built digital identity platforms with a couple of partners that are global,"" he said. ""We're actually working with tech partners, the likes of Gemalto [part of the Thales Group, one of the largest identity management companies in the world], who actually are members of government-organized pension funds.""      In the legacy system, people have to create identity profiles for each and every pension scheme they sign up to over the course of their working lives. By using blockchain, people could create a single identity profile, with verifiable information like passports and driving licenses, that they themselves hold and share with their pension providers, according to R3.      ""The blockchain angle essentially gives users control over their digital identity ... instead of a third party providing a service, a blockchain network could potentially mean citizens are in control of their identity and organizations including government departments would exist on the network and users would be able to selectively disclose parts of their identity as needed,"" Ali said.      R3's Corda blockchain has already been used to create identity management systems. Software company Persistent launched a self-sovereign identity solution on Corda that allows users to create and manage their own identities. Another company, Cordentity, offers identity management that can be integrated into enterprise blockchain Hyperledger.      However, pension pot administration ""is definitely one of the use cases where we can find the most economic value,"" Ali said. It is already being used by pensions startup GROW Super, which helps Australians recover missing workplace pensions.      The idea is also gaining traction in government departments. In September 2019, the German government said it would launch a pilot project for a blockchain-based digital identity sometime in the future.    Why a blockchain?      But while many experts recognize the usefulness of a standardized digital identity profile, some have expressed skepticism over why it should use blockchain.      David Birch, director at electronic transactions consultancy firm Consult Hyperion, said it was not ""transparently obvious"" what value blockchain really adds. A centralized database, in his opinion, would function just as well at allowing users to share their digital identities.      ""Does it make a difference to these verifiable identities that they are stored on a distributed ledger? I don't think it does,"" Birch said.      The only difference is blockchain makes users responsible for maintaining their own identities, Birch said. But many would probably prefer a regulated third party to handle their profiles for them.      That many blockchain-based identity management systems did not have an answer for how to deal with lost private keys presented yet another danger, he added.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/24/blockchain-can-help-uk-savers-recover-48b-in-unclaimed-pensions-says-r3,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1ba1b49a742a99375ede4092118f5f780235e580-1500x978.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

John said it was ""really important"" BoE and other central banks considered whether digital currencies could form the basis of a new payment system and, if so, ""quicken the pace"" on determining how to regulate the new asset class.      The BoE needs to consider its position on the technology to ensure the U.K. has ""a broad range of payments that it can use with confidence,"" John said, as reported by the Daily Telegraph on Saturday. “It is absolutely right that central banks think about whether a public sector or private sector would be best to provide a digital currency going forward.”      John, who as the BoE's chief cashier is responsible for issuing banknotes in the U.K., said it was ""so crucial"" that central banks also determine how to define the role of private companies issuing their own cryptocurrencies in future, such as Facebook's involvement with the Libra project.      The BoE was one of seven financial institutions that co-founded a new working group in January with the aim of sharing research and findings into central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).      Other working group members include Sweden's Riksbank, which announced Friday it would soon pilot a new e-krona initiative, expected to run until 2021, that would increase the bank's knowledge of CBDCs by testing the digital currency in a series of scenarios and stress-tests.      Sources have also told the Japan Times that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) – another member of the working group – has had several meetings with the Finance Ministry and Financial Services Agency (FSA) to discuss potential economic effects of digital currencies as well as move forward on collaborative research.      BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said: “We are advancing research and study from the technical and legal perspectives so that we will be able to move in an appropriate way when there is a growing need.”      Japanese politicians had expressed concern digital currencies, such as the one being developed by China, could seriously challenge the existing dollar-based economic order.

Bitcoin remained resilient around $9,650 on Friday, despite a bearish turn by the money flow index, and rose to five figures on Sunday.      Importantly, with the rejection at $10,000, bitcoin has logged another bearish lower high on the technical charts – one of a succession since the recent rally stalled at $10,500 on Feb. 13.      Invalidation of the lower highs setup is needed to revive the immediate bullish case. As a result, the high around $10,000 observed during Monday's Asia hours is the level to beat for the bulls.      Bitcoin is currently trading at $9,750 on Bitstamp. Meanwhile, its global average price as calculated by the Bitcoin Price Index is $9,765, down 1.38 percent over 24 hours.    4-hour chart    Bitcoin has printed three lower highs (marked by arrows) on the four-hour chart over the last 10 days, the latest being $10,028 (as per Bitstamp prices).      A high-volume move above that level would imply a continuation of the broader uptrend from January lows below $7,000 and open the doors for a re-test of the Feb. 13 high of $10,500.      However, at press time, bitcoin is looking south, with the trendline rising from Feb. 19 lows now breached to the downside. So a drop to the 200-candle average at $9,508 cannot be ruled out.      Acceptance under that technical line, which acted as strong support last week, could bring a deeper slide toward the higher low of $9,075. (Feb. 4 low).    Weekly chart    Bitcoin produced a doji candle last week, as prices swung both ways in the range of $10,300 to $9,300 before closing out on a flat note. The pattern appeared after a notable price rally and is indicative of indecision among buyers.      A strong move above $10,300 would imply bull confidence has returned and would likely yield a stronger move toward $11,000.      Failing that, though, a sell-off to below $9,300 would confirm a bearish doji reversal pattern.      The odds of a move above $10,300 would rise if the lower-highs setup on the four-hour chart is invalidated with strong volumes.

Launched thanks to its partnership with Epay, Binance said on Monday users can deposit and withdraw Hong Kong dollars from today for trading against supported cryptocurrencies.      Binance already supports euros and pounds sterling through Epay, a payments provider founded in Hong Kong in 2014.      The latest addition is something of a coup for the exchange because banks in the jurisdiction are notoriously averse to offering accounts to cryptocurrency companies.      The local Gatecoin exchange closed last spring blaming a funds freeze by a payments processor after having difficulties finding banking for some time. While the firm attempted to survive using other payments services from outside of Hong Kong, it put down its eventual closing to not having ever got the frozen funds back.      Binance has been rapidly rolling out new fiat gateways in a push to serve local markets globally, having been a purely crypto-to-crypto trading platform until last autumn.

42404051,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhFWM,1582538400,China Has Many Strategic Reasons to Invest in Blockchain,"Byrne Hobart, a CoinDesk columnist, is an investor, consultant and writer in New York. His newsletter, The Diff (diff.substack.com) covers inflection points in finance and technology.      In October, China’s President Xi Jinping said China should “seize the opportunity” to use the blockchain. To cryptocurrency advocates, this is exciting – and confusing. Why would a deeply centralized country want to use an intrinsically decentralized technology? Why would a country that exercises tight control over its currency want to try a new, un-tested currency system?      The paradoxical answer is Xi Jinping isn’t thinking like an engineer (although Xi himself has a BS in chemical engineering from Tsinghua). He’s actually in a different mindset entirely: somewhere between corporate blockchain consultant and ICO scammer.      Like many technological abstractions, blockchains are useful in certain domains where their tradeoffs make sense: If you need a system with no trusted third party at the cost of lower throughput, it’s great. If you’re fine with trusted third parties (as most consumers of financial services are) and need to handle lots of concurrent transactions (as existing payment platforms do), it’s not so great.      But blockchain is also a social technology – a way to make otherwise-boring issues exciting. The biggest impact blockchain has had on traditional banks is it briefly convinced them back-office functions like clearing were trendy and worth investing in. Since back-office functions were the first to be automated, they run on fairly creaky technology, generally designed by people who are now retired or dead. (The remaining COBOL Cowboys do very well under this arrangement.)    They can redirect that hype towards other goals.    Officials at the Chinese Communist Party know that blockchain is a popular technology, and they probably know the applications are presently limited. But they can redirect that hype towards other goals.      It’s atypical for a head of state to get really excited about ways to slightly optimize a country’s back-office IT systems. But there are two reasons for him to care about using blockchain.      Optimistically, a blockchain-based title system could solve a major problem in Chinese lending: It’s relatively easy for borrowers to reuse the same collateral. This is hard to measure (if you could measure it, you could fix it), and it won’t be visible until borrowers start to default and more than one lender attempts to seize the same collateral.      Pessimistically, a new digital currency would give China a head start in escaping dollar hegemony, tying China’s economy more closely with Belt and Road Initiative investment recipients and Russia.      It’s the latter scenario that represents the most interesting and important blockchain application. Right now, global trade is dominated by the dollar – intra-European trade happens in euros, and Japan settles transactions in yen. But most trade between countries not part of the Eurozone is still settled in dollars.      This gives the U.S. a powerful foreign policy tool: America uses sanctions, against individuals and companies, to enforce policy goals. Since almost every global financial institution needs to use dollars, they all end up complying. This doesn’t just involve U.S. regulators punishing U.S. companies for violations; America has also gone after French banks for violating U.S. sanctions, even though their transactions were legal in France. It’s somewhat analogous to China’s habit of penalizing American companies for treating Taiwan as a country.      In the China/Taiwan case, China can threaten to interfere with companies’ business in China. In the U.S. sanctions case, the U.S. can unilaterally cripple any major global financial institution, since so many of them do business in dollars and – crucially – have dollar-denominated liabilities they need to roll over.      If China announced, as a policy matter, that it was trying to de-dollarize their economy, it would spark panic. Getting off the dollar is enormously expensive and inconvenient, and if they urgently want to do so it implies they’re panicking because staying on a dollar-based system is scarier than risking a crisis. But if China is exploring a cool new technology, a modern and decentralized system, it doesn’t sound like panic at all; it sounds like openness and progress. It sounds like China relaxing its grip on citizens’ financial transactions, rather than increasing its control over trading partners.      (Of course, we don’t know what the implementation of a Chinese digital-first currency would look like. We don’t know how much anonymity will be built in. But here’s something we do know: pseudonymous currency systems like bitcoin (BTC) get de-anonymized when people change money to and from fiat; when the Feds catch one crypto money-launderer, they’ll end up catching all of that person’s clients. The CCP is the single organization best positioned to de-anonymize any given Chinese cryptocurrency user, given its in-depth tracking of all online behavior and its mandatory facial recognition for smartphones.)      Anyone who has spent time in the blockchain space develops a certain skepticism and a nose for hype. When someone says “blockchain,” your first question should be, “What do they really want?” In Xi Jinping’s case, the answer is more interesting than average. But if you worry about privacy rights in China or political stability worldwide, it's a lot more worrisome, too.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Byrne Hobart,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/24/china-has-many-strategic-reasons-to-invest-in-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e99106a9852f3bbb36e1b9c675504d0e66c52527-1500x994.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404052,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhFXL,1582534800,How the Ethereum Foundation Got UNICEF to Embrace Blockchain,"Donating to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) may turn out to be the Ethereum Foundation’s shrewdest move yet.      “We are still discussing the details on what we can do together, but we have decided to continue support for the next couple of years,” said Ethereum Foundation Director Aya Miyaguchi. “I believe a partnership with a group like UNICEF can maximize our impact without shifting our focus from what we still need to do to improve Ethereum as a technology.”      The foundation donated roughly $150,000 worth of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) to UNICEF’s experimental crypto fund in October 2019. Since then the UNICEF Kazakhstan office has developed an ethereum-based system for processing internal payments, such as sending funds from the UNICEF headquarters to people running a local education program.      “We can see now clearly it’s operational and it’s great for the organization. So we will continue to work on that,” said UNICEF partnership specialist Oleksandra Gaskevych. “We only have used ethereum so far, for smart contracts. We’re thinking maybe we could test bitcoin as well for digital currency transfers, so we’ll see.”      The Kazakhstan-based team is still putting a few finishing touches on the smart contract platform, because UNICEF budgets require multiple signatures from people with varying degrees of clearance. Today, a significant amount of office paperwork still involves people double-checking expenditures by hand. So this new digital process is much more efficient.      Gaskevych said the office expects to start transitioning over to the ethereum-based system in 2021.      “We can easily adapt it to other Russian-speaking countries in the region,” she added.    Tunisian pilots    Elsewhere, UNICEF is also partnering with SoftBank Investment Advisers (SBIA) to develop a structure for distributing cryptocurrency. Chris Fabian, co-lead of UNICEF Ventures, said so far the crypto fund is starting slow by funding several startups like Coinsence, a Tunisian token project experimenting with ERC-20 tokens for community currencies.      Coinsence founder Karim Chabrak said more than 200 people in the beach town of Hammamet, with roughly 100,000 residents, participated in a pilot program that is graduating to a fully operational phase this quarter.      “There are communities that have no money and a lot of unemployed youth,” Chabrak said. “Communities need to be able to address that without waiting for governments to act.”      Residents mainly use the token to pay volunteers for jobs like beach cleaning, then offer them a discount at participating businesses. Chabrak said the goal is to reduce the unemployment rate and encourage productive spending habits. This year, Chabrak said he is establishing a national association with a legal framework to support any other community that wants to issue its own local token.      “We heard about bitcoin in 2010,” Chabrak said. “But we are trying to build currencies that aren’t speculative, that are part of the commons.”      All of these experiments were funded by the Ethereum Foundation, which also acts as a consulting resource but not an official partner like SBIA. For example, Coinsence received 50 ether, most of which was used for pilots and research in late 2019. Likewise, the Argentinian startup Atix Labs received a bitcoin from the Ethereum Foundation’s donation, and developed software tools that Fabian said may be useful for the program in Kazakhstan.      Fabian said last year’s donation from the Ethereum Foundation was “part of a larger agreement with them, that we had to test some of the piping with them first.”    Multi-pronged approach    The ethereum community is investing in global outreach through this agreement with UNICEF, even without directly implementing blockchain solutions.      “They’ve made the community available to us for a variety of things,” Fabian said.      This created a ripple effect beyond the donations themselves. For example, Gaskevych said basic materials related to blockchain technology and smart contracts were incorporated into the Kazakhstan office’s digital literacy program for youth, teaching 200 people about ethereum so far. As UNICEF looks to transition its internal system, and find external partners willing to accept ether, the team is focused on training local talent to develop customized solutions for specific needs.      Fabian clarified only a few of UNICEF’s external partners in Kazakhstan are willing to accept cryptocurrency for the services they already provide, like an internet service provider or a construction company.      “That’s fine, we’re not trying to push it,” he said. “It’s not that we are only paying them in crypto, we’re also paying them in fiat so there’s a little bit of hedge.”      Over the next two years, Fabian said UNICEF’s goal is to help schools without internet connections get online by supporting local tech ventures, some of which may choose to run their own cryptocurrency nodes and earn revenue from providing connectivity to people and businesses in the surrounding neighborhoods. That’s how UNICEF aims to make this project sustainable beyond one-off donations.      In addition to the global school initiative, called GIGA, Chabrak said he hopes community currencies in Tunisia will be designed to help nonprofits and universities promote the United Nations’ sustainability goals by incentivizing eco-friendly habits.    Why ETH?    To be clear, there’s one main reason ethereum became the most widely used blockchain technology across UNICEF’s global development strategy, which seeks to deploy nearly $45 billion in diverse programs around the world. The reason is the Ethereum Foundation reached out and ponied up.      Even though the donation was a tiny fraction of UNICEF’s related budget, the “agreement'' Fabian referenced motivated his fund to set up a compliant system for receiving and distributing cryptocurrency. The fund also accepts bitcoin, but there have been hardly any bitcoin donations so far, Fabian said.      Based on his research in Tunisia, Chabrak said the most challenging part of getting people to use cryptocurrency was inspiring a sense of personal ownership over an asset that isn’t associated with a familiar entity, like the government. That’s why foreign startup tokens, and to some extent bitcoin, have been a harder sell.      “Communities are not so motivated to build an ecosystem around the currency because they don’t identify with the currency and have full control,” he said. “People accept the coins when they know the people that are issuing the coins and they can implement their own governance.”      (The fact such communities don’t see bitcoin as something they can control and influence the governance of may be, in part, a misunderstanding.)      With that in mind, the Ethereum Foundation’s strategy of finding an indirect way to fund blockchain education and entrepreneurship in emerging markets, where other computer science resources are scarce, may eventually set it apart among blockchain projects competing for both market- and mind-share.      “Cryptocurrency is too often seen as a means for investment, but as you know, ethereum is capable of so much more than that,” Miyaguchi said. “Whether with UNICEF or other parties, we are always looking for ways to maximize our impact using the technology that we’re helping to build.”",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/24/how-the-ethereum-foundation-got-unicef-to-embrace-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/08c71c094c0f55aa4fd183aab7d877b3b8c72328-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404069,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhFm6,1582531200,In Defense of Justin Sun,"Alexander S. Blum is chief operating officer of Two Prime. He has led blockchain projects and startups for more than seven years including at Atomic Capital, crypto hedge funds, and consulting projects at Fortune 500s, the World Economic Forum and prominent blockchain startups.      I recently had the good fortune to attend the 2020 Satoshi Roundtable in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico. While there, I met TRON founder and CEO Justin Sun. I also witnessed the social media feeding frenzy that ensued as prominent crypto Twitter influencers posted trolling tweets with him. It was really fun. To many, Justin and TRON epitomize a class of useless altcoins – superficial marketers perverting crypto’s “true” purpose. There are oft-repeated claims Justin and his team plagiarized their white paper and that TRON has no value as a technology. Yet, TRON currently hovers around a $1.3 billion market cap, already acquired BitTorrent and Steemit, and Justin and friends recently palled around with Warren Buffet. What the hell?      I’ve seen a wide breadth of this industry after seven years, working at traditional and blockchain VC funds, leading security token business Atomic Capital and now as the COO of crypto finance firm Two Prime. It may seem baffling this 29-year-old wunderkind leads one of the largest blockchain networks in the world. However, when you approach the spectacle of TRON and Justin Sun with a traditional financial lens, you start to see that maybe all the flack TRON receives points to something else – an industry lost in theoretical achievements to the detriment of practical ones.    Building a blockchain and a business    It’s useful to look at Justin’s background to start. The kid is no dummy. He studied at the University of Pennsylvania and was hand-selected to attend Jack Ma’s Hupan University. Prior to starting TRON, Justin worked as the head of Ripple in China. Ripple’s model, similar to EOS,’ is what we at Two Prime refer to as a Continuous Token Offering – an ongoing sale of a token in public and private market concurrent with the use of raised funds. Knowing this, it seems to me Justin has taken his Ripple experience and applied it to TRON, seeing the token as a financial instrument before a technical one.      So then why the TRON disdain and epithets? Like many altcoins, TRON is a money-making initiative often posing as a technical product. This branch of cryptocurrencies exists because technical blockchain jargon provides regulatory cover and fundraising juice for what are, essentially, financial products. While a “dividend payout” implies a regulated security product, a “user staking reward” doesn’t. In practice, they are pretty damn similar. Additionally, the language of things like Web3, Layer 2 solutions and Oracles speaks to long-time crypto buyers and helps TRON to market itself adeptly. It’s this false, technical facade that draws the ire of more purely focused technologists.      “True” blockchain technologists are quick to delineate between the “real” blockchains and tokens and those just looking to make a quick buck. Yet, if we try to understand the realities of entrepreneurs like Justin, we can see why technical language offers a sensible way to raise funds and develop a global, borderless business. It helps sidestep the constraints of regulation while tapping into a thriving community of supporters. Though TRON has drawn criticism for putting promotion before development – it seems they wisely focused first on building adequate capitalization and community. Having done that, they are now executing on some of the technical claims they initially espoused – much in the same way Binance did.    Dropping the intellectual snobbery    Viewed through the lens of traditional finance, TRON is acting pretty predictably. It is acquiring more market share through the acquisition of weakened competitors, like BitTorrent, and their networks while promoting their retail financial product. They’re performing a balancing act between being a financial product and a technical one. As with EOS, this need to keep up two competing business identities may become a barrier to TRON in the long term. If it could drop the pure technology act (like the TRON Developer Guide) and simply behave as a FinTech investment product, they could expend less money and energy on, most likely, a dead-end blockchain and useless dapps and instead work to appeal to mainstream finance.      Justin is leading TRON as a for-profit business pretty well. Why does that irk many hardcore developers? For those in the Western world sticking up their noses at TRON, it’s worth reflecting on how deeply elitist it is to judge from a position of pure technical idealism.      As a former Peace Corps volunteer, I can tell you that most people don’t care about DeFi and obscure dapps. They care about making money and eating food. The emergence of TRON in highly competitive Asian markets is commendable. They are pioneering a new business model and creating wealth ex nihilo – out of thin air – because they focus on what works today. Their users share the company’s pragmatism. TRON, EOS and Ripple are pioneering community-centric financial products that offer exciting new models for wealth creation. Building a loyal base of users that will accept these tokens as money sounds similar to the start of the U.S. dollar. Better yet, TRON is bringing together a community bound by culture rather than geography or ethnicity, and without violent coercion.      It’s no surprise to me Justin sought a meeting with Warren Buffet and not Steve Wozniak. Buffet has made a fortune from discerning real value and human needs, like razors and insurance, and isn’t lost in technical hyperbole. From what I’ve seen, Justin has the insight to recognize the interplay between a product marketed as technology and the financial reality of its applications. This clear-eyed approach to growth and success could be a lesson for many in the industry who are still lost in the abstract world, trying to wrap golden ponies dancing in magical rainbows on a blockchain. Maybe it’s time we put aside the self-congratulations for our technical genius and start making stuff real people care about.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Alexander S Blum,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/24/in-defense-of-justin-sun,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7dfc0124db3fd0679bc02a7b9320d6a8ce4e9722-1191x822.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404065,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhFiA,1582527600,"Central Bankers From Canada, Netherlands, Ukraine Call Blockchain Unnecessary for Digital Fiat","KYIV, Ukraine — Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have been a hot topic in blockchain circles recently, but central banks are lukewarm about blockchains.      Representatives of a number of the world’s central banks discussed their CBDC projects last week in Kyiv, Ukraine. The one-day conference was arranged by the National Bank of Ukraine, or NBU, which itself is a CBDC pioneer, having run its own digital currency pilot in 2018.      The central bank wanted to test its ideas and conclusions with the banking community and stimulate the discussion, the head of its innovative development department, Roman Hartinger, told CoinDesk. The speakers included representatives of NBU’s peers from Canada, Japan, Lithuania, Finland, Netherlands, Belarus, Uruguay and South Africa.      The discussion comes at a time when the world's two largest economies are each seriously exploring the possibility of issuing a CBDC, although China appears to be much further down the road than the U.S.      According to a report issued in September, NBU started exploring the idea of a digital currency, named e-hryvnia after Ukraine’s national currency, as early as 2016. In 2018, the central bank tested a digital token running on a fork, or modified copy, of the Stellar blockchain.      The pilot was run with the tech startup AtticLab, fintech companies Uapay and OMP 2013 and with ""Big Four"" professional-services firm Deloitte as an auditor, the report says. From September to December 2018, the NBU tested the software with a limited set of participants.      The tests showed that “there are no fundamental advantages in using specifically the DLT [distributed ledger technology] to build a centralized e-hryvnia issuance system” in which NBU is the only issuer, the report says. However, the central bank does not rule out an alternative “decentralized” model, in which multiple trusted payment processors would issue e-hryvnia.      The experiment is on hold, awaiting more input from the banking community and legislation regulating digital assets in Ukraine. While there are some drafts and concepts circulated by the country’s authorities, formal laws are yet to be passed.    Cool on crypto    The skepticism about distributed ledgers was shared by Hartinger’s colleagues from the Netherlands and Canada at the Kyiv conference.      “The essence of the DLT infrastructure is that no single party should be trusted enough, but don’t we just trust a central bank to maintain the integrity of the global ledger?” said Harro Boven, policy adviser in the payments policy department of the Dutch central bank.      Scott Hendry, senior special director of fintech at Bank of Canada, which piloted its Jasper project (built on R3's Corda DLT platform) last year, agreed that “you don’t need a DLT to make a central bank digital currency.”      “There doesn’t seem to be a lot of benefits if you look at a DLT system and the current efficient centralized system for the sole purpose of interbank payments,” Hendry said, adding that in the back office he leads, “they wouldn’t change anything” in the technology stack currently in use.      No speaker ruled out using DLT for a CBDC in principle, but none showed much enthusiasm about the tech.    A wake-up call    Then why even bother to create central bank digital currencies – the concept that initially was pitched as a trusted, government-blessed kind of cryptocurrency? The reason is Facebook's Libra, says Jamiel Sheikh, the CEO of consulting firm Chainhaus.      While the project met strong pushback from the governments across the globe, the thought of a big private company issuing its own digital currency sent waves all around financial circles.      “The era of private money is here, and it’s something they have to pay attention to. It’s a response to a threat that can stimulate innovation,” Sheikh told CoinDesk.      Hartinger also pointed at the atypical competitive situation central banks found themselves in:      “Central banks see Big Tech issuing stablecoins, like Libra, they see this niche of digital money and now it’s the matter of who will have a money issuance prerogative, governments or the private tech companies?” Hartinger told CoinDesk.      “Libra was a wake-up call for us. Central banks have been challenged to innovate,” Harro Boven said on stage, echoing recent comments by none other than U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell.      A representative of one of the central banks present at the conference, who shared his thoughts with CoinDesk off stage and asked not to be identified, said Libra catalyzed a process of exploration that has been long overdue. However, he said he’s not worried about the competition from Facebook.      “People would want to use Libra if our monetary system screwed up. Our best defense is to do our job,” he said.    Dirtying their hands    Still, not all the central banks have given up on blockchains yet.      Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden, which recently announced a pilot for a digital krona, or e-krona, together with consulting firm Accenture, is going to use R3’s Corda blockchain.      The e-krona is a kind of electronic cash for everyday use, a tool for payments between households, denominated in the national currency and accessible 24/7, Riksbank’s senior policy adviser to the payments department Bjorn Segendorf said on stage.      Segendorf told CoinDesk the Riksbank will try out the Corda technology not because the central bank has its mind set on a blockchain-based solution – you just need to try different things to learn.      “We need to get our hands dirty,” he explained. Now it’s trying Corda; later, it can try something else.      The main point of the exercise is to be ready for the cashless future, Segendorf said, as young adults rely less and less on cash, to see what such a world looks like and how a central bank can deal with it, so that “if we need to issue a CBDC we don’t have to start from scratch.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/02/24/central-bankers-from-canada-netherlands-ukraine-call-blockchain-unnecessary-for-digital-fiat,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5ea8e8b0da488b1fa6ef9ab80111c996989f0d39-1200x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404058,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhFcG,1582520400,"On EOS Blockchain, Vote Buying Is Business as Usual","Buying votes is a big no-no in traditional democracies, but on the world’s eighth-largest blockchain it’s become an accepted way of doing business.      A new service makes it easier for EOS block producers, the nodes elected by holders of the cryptocurrency to validate transactions on the network, to share their block rewards with those who voted for them. The service, known as Genpool, was introduced this month by GenerEOS, which itself is a block producer candidate.      Back when EOSIO, the software powering the $3.7 billion EOS chain, was just an idea, the crypto community debated whether delegated proof-of-stake, or DPoS, would lead to validation candidates effectively bribing users to support them. (DPoS is a consensus mechanism that limits the number of node validators to a fixed set.) Early on, the EOS community believed it could prevent such activity.      Now the community is all-in on what proponents call “voter rebates.”      ""The Genpool platform is a zero barrier to entry free market ecosystem, connecting proxy owners with voters that are looking to support quality Block Producers (BPs) while being rewarded with a percentage of the additional BP income,” GenerEOS said in a Medium post announcing the service.      GenerEOS's Tim Weston declined an interview with CoinDesk.      While similar services have launched in Asia, Genpool appears to be the first in the English-speaking EOS world explicitly designed to help token holders find the best payouts for their votes from block producers. (Like bitcoin (BTC) miners, EOS block producers are rewarded with freshly minted cryptocurrency for recording transactions on the public ledger.) In short, Genpool lets EOS (EOS) holders get paid to participate in governance.      To critics, this fulfills longstanding fears that in a system where governance is delgated, the richest will dominate. Permitting payments makes it even easier for the wealthiest to cement their position.      There is nothing stopping a validator from acting is if it were more than one entity, allowing whales to hold multiple spots on the governing council of block producers, effectively mounting a Sybil attack, the research team at the Binance cryptocurrency exchange wrote in a report released Feb. 18.      ""A single actor may register multiple block producer accounts and multiply their voting weight at a negligible cost,” the report said. “Simultaneously, having multiple BP entities allows [that actor] to allocate more block rewards to voters, increasing the competitiveness of the underlying actor.""      Binance stopped withdrawals of eos tokens in late January when it saw instability on the network, possibly due to upgrades to the latest version of the EOSIO software released by Block.One. Other exchanges such as Upbit and OKEx paused withdrawals at the time.    What are proxies?    Genpool will probably sound a little convoluted to those who aren't well versed in EOS, so hang tight.      To recap, every eos holder has the option to stake their tokens to the vote for block producers, the entities that validate transactions on the network and ultimately hold all power over code changes and even wallet validity.      In fact, getting enough votes staked was the big holdup for launching EOS after Block.One released the EOSIO software.      Each holder can vote for up to 30 block producers, but they don't have to. Votes are allocated in proportion to the amount of currency the voter holds. If someone has five eos and stakes it all to vote, each block producer candidate they voted for gets five votes, whether the holder picked three, seven or 17 of them.      These votes run continuously, so a block producer can be in, out again 10 minutes later and in again 10 minutes after that.      But deciding on 30 entities to vote for is hard. Hence, voter proxies have arisen on EOS. These services choose a slate of BP candidates to vote for and voters can simply point their eos at the proxy.      Because the proxies get rewards when they vote for BPs who share their inflation rewards, they can in turn share those rewards with voters who back them.      Genpool is going one step further, making it easy to find proxies with attractive rewards and other attributes that the voter might be looking for (such as fee, philosophy, stake volume and etc).    Against it, then for it    When EOS was first getting off the ground (an arduous process CoinDesk covered closely in 2018), the early participants spent a lot of time coming up with a constitution to govern the ecosystem. That draft constitution banned vote-buying and reflected a consensus among the grassroots organizations that launched EOS.      But EOS launched without incorporating any governance process into its code beyond picking BPs. When the blockchain went up, the whales rolled in and the constitution was proven to be a dead letter from the jump.      In late 2018, vote-buying made for a mild scandal on EOS. The following year, EOS dropped the idea of a constitution for an end-user license agreement – with no mention of vote-buying at all. Today, vote-buying is not only tolerated, it’s normal.      Colin Talks Crypto, a pseudonymous YouTuber and proxy leader who is long EOS but critical of its current governance, created a voting proxy specifically to fight vote-buying. But in a video released in September, he acknowledged the realities of vote-buying and announced he was creating a second proxy that supported the best block producer that buy votes.      Brendan Blumer, the CEO of Block.One, which created the software that runs the EOS blockchain, has also come out in favor of vote-buying.      ""Voter rebates just drive value back to token holders,"" Blumer tweeted earlier this month. ""I’m a huge supporter.""      As CoinDesk has previously reported, Block.One sits on such a large amount of tokens that it could completely change the makeup of the voting structure, but so far it hasn't voted on governance participants. However, Blumer tweeted Feb. 19 suggesting the company could start voting its tokens this year.      “B1 voting is coming,” he wrote. “We’re working towards the establishment of a non-profit entity that will give token holders another voting option and will work to redefine public blockchain viability and competitiveness.”    It is what it is    The general consensus of crypto thought leaders polled by CoinDesk seems to be this: Vote-buying in blockchain governance is likely inevitable.      CoinShares Chief Strategy Officer Meltem Demirors called crypto governance itself a ""hot mess,” but said a service to help manage the buying and selling of votes was better than an opaque market. Of the idea of a service that makes bidding out votes easy, she wrote, ""Great – let's set a transparent price for governance.""      ""Collusion, coercion, manipulation, lobbying, bribing and gerrymandering are part and parcel to the processes of modern democracies. It would be foolish to believe that crypto governance would be absent of these forces,"" she told CoinDesk, echoing similar comments from a year ago.      Spencer Bogart, of Blockchain Capital, sounded similarly resigned to the situation, telling CoinDesk, ""I think most, if not all, on-chain governance schemes will eventually amount to implicit or explicit vote-buying schemes, so it may be in EOS's interest to simply embrace this fact rather than resist it.""      Bogart, it should be noted, has been skeptical of EOS since before its launch.      Joshua Gans, an economist who's done work on token economics, sees corrosive second-order effects of vote-buying.      When it becomes normal, he wrote, “there is no incentive to really learn about whether someone is a trustworthy node operator and, moreover, there is no 'payback' to being trustworthy. You earn as much as you payout just to be a node.""      But he conceded that it could all still work out. ""The question is whether all of this is bad: after all, the network is being operated and costs are being covered,"" he wrote.    Vitalik, vindicated    For the record, Vitalik Buterin called all of this.      The ethereum (ETH) creator weighed in on what he saw as the inevitable vote-buying to come on EOS in a March 2018 post titled, ""Governance, Part 2: Plutocracy Is Still Bad.”      ""Bribery is, in fact, bad,” Buterin wrote. “There are actually people who dispute this claim; the usual argument has something to do with market efficiency.""      He argued that vote-buying led to centralization in ways that just imitated the old economy crypto was meant to upend.      ""The average voter has only a very small chance of impacting which delegates get selected … their incentive is to vote for whoever offers the highest and most reliable bribe,"" he wrote.      Indeed, the only real power eos holders have on the network is to vote block producers in or out. On the Tezos blockchain, by contrast, regular holders vote on code changes. On EOS, even updates are wholly the purview of block producers.      That said, voters can kick out BPs at any time, as described above, but there are a lot of voters and only a few BPs – a real imbalance in ease of coordination.      The heart of Buterin’s prediction about vote-buying comes down to cartels. He described how delegate candidates will inevitably start offering better and better terms to voters to win votes, until at some point a bloc forms to stabilize the instability. Worse, as Binance's report describes, there can even be single-entity cartels: organizations that take up more than one slot on the list of block producers, by pretending to be multiple entities.      Rumors of cartels on EOS abound but clear evidence hasn't yet come to light. Meanwhile, evidence of vote-buying has, so that even its discontents have come to accept it. As long as the code allows it, people will do it.      ""Playing by the rules right now is the best we can do on EOS until we can actually fix governance,"" Colin TalksCrypto said in his video.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/24/on-eos-blockchain-vote-buying-is-business-as-usual,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0d47b7e1cf4ceb0dbca4ae913c78f639add595ae-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
