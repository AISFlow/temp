42379481,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX885Wj,1494968409,Ripple's XRP Token Sets New All-Time Price High,"The price of XRP, the token that powers the Ripple Consensus Ledger, continued its upward movement today, building on recent gains to hit a new all-time high.  Overall, the token's price climbed to as much as $0.33 at roughly 11:25 UTC, representing a roughly 40% gain in the space of just 24 hours, according to data provider CoinMarketCap. The cryptocurrency fell to less than $0.029 less than a month ago, and has climbed more than 1,000% since then.  As for what caused this sustained rally, analysts identified a few key factors.  Several traders pointed to fear of missing out (FOMO) as driving XRP's continued price gains.  This fear is playing a key role in causing the cryptocurrency to push higher, Marouane Garcon, founder of private blockchain investment firm Loch Loyal, told CoinDesk:  ""When something runs like XRP is running, people want in.""  Garcon stated that there is ""definitely a snowball effect,"" adding that it is difficult to blame investors for being interested when XRP is producing impressive gains.  Also providing tailwinds was an announcement by Ripple to add clarity to how it will manage its own holdings of XRP, and how it will use its funds to power its projects.  As revealed to CoinDesk earlier today, the company plans to lock up $14bn in funds, announcing a plan that staggers how such funds can be accessed.  Bank backing  While analysts emphasized the importance to FOMO, they also pointed out that Ripple has the backing of major banks, a development which they cited as contributing to the cryptocurrency's recent price rally.  Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged cryptocurrency trading platform Whaleclub, weighed in on this situation, stating that he believes the distributed ledger network is developing a unique value proposition in a growing field of competitors.  ""Big money is betting that Ripple will power bank-to-bank and bank-to-consumer international money transfers in the future. Remittance is a [$500bn per year] market and Ripple has made great headway into it by partnering with major banks,"" he said.  He further told CoinDesk he now believes new money is being invested into the platform's cryptocurrency as a result of its recent gains.

42379477,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX885UD,1494963034,Coinbase Users Ask Court to Stop IRS Bitcoin Tax Hunt,"Two unnamed Coinbase customers are seeking to stop the IRS from obtaining records on the digital currency exchange's user base.  On 15th May, law firm Berns Weiss LLP filed a motion seeking to quash – legal-speak for rendering invalid – the IRS summons, which it first submitted in November. At the time, the US tax agency sought records on Coinbase's bitcoin users in a bid to catch potential tax cheats (the IRS deemed bitcoin and other digital currencies a taxable form of property in 2014).  That effort sparked what has become a months-long legal battle that saw Berns Weiss intervene on behalf of its own managing partner, Jeffrey Berns, as well as Coinbase itself jumping into the fray.  The IRS ultimately asked another federal judge in March to enforce the summons, which Coinbase indicated at the time it intended to fight. Court records show that, on 4th May, Judge Jacqueline Corley ordered the IRS and Coinbase to propose a briefing schedule during which Coinbase is expected to mount its defense.  Berns Weiss submitted the new filing on behalf of two customers, referred in the documents as John Doe 1 and John Doe 2. The filing, according to the law firm, was spurred by the Corley's 4th May decision and ""to insure that Coinbase's customers are represented in the proceeding and that the Court has the opportunity to consider their perspective"".  Notably, according to a separate filing, the two customers in question are seeking anonymity. The reason, they argue, is to prevent the IRS from ""attempting to moot Movants' motion by withdrawing its request that Coinbase provide Movants' records"".  Attorney Lee Weiss said in a statement:  ""We look forward to the opportunity to finally litigate the merits of the IRS Summons and for the Court to consider the grave privacy and financial risks to which Coinbase’s customers will be exposed if the summons is enforced in its current form.""

According to the publication, the service will target shipping companies and other supply chain-oriented firms.  A spokesperson for SK C&C told the Daily:  ""Currently, shipping companies and each land carrier have independent logistics systems that are often incompatible. In such a case, cargo management data needs to be reconfirmed and recorded every time the cargo is transferred to another sub-carrier, making the logistics process inefficient.""  Details posted on SK C&C's website suggest that the platform will support trade finance applications as well.

42379479,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX885ZF,1494950419,Ripple Pledges to Lock Up $14 Billion in XRP Cryptocurrency,"Distributed financial technology firm Ripple is on the verge of locking up billions of dollars worth of its native XRP cryptocurrency inside dozens of smart contracts designed to hold value in escrow until a certain time, or certain conditions are met.  The move to voluntarily freeze its own assets in escrow contracts is designed to combat fears that Ripple might flood its booming market with some of the $16bn worth of cryptocurrency it currently stores and that resulted from holding large amounts of its own currency that hasn't been made available to the public.  Specifically, the San Francisco firm has promised to lock-up 88% of those funds, or about $14bn worth, in a series of smart contracts that briefly make 1bn XRP available each month for a period of at least four-and-a-half years.  Revealed today exclusively to CoinDesk, Ripple hopes the self-inflicted freezing of funds will give XRP owners and aspiring owners a sense of certainty that the market will not suddenly be flooded with the currency, potentially lowering the price.  While Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse argued in interview with CoinDesk that flooding the market would be irrational, and go against his firm's own self-interest, he added that it was time to move the tokens to the smart contracts and remove the element of trust altogether.  Garlinghouse said:  ""We want to make sure that the Ripple Consensus Ledger is the most robust, and that XRP is the most liquid, and I think this is a very positive step towards that.""  Currently, Ripple’s market cap is listed on most tracking sites as about $11bn, based on 38.3bn XRP in circulation. But unlike other cryptocurrencies including bitcoin and ethereum, not all the cryptocurrency is in circulation. In fact, according to Ripple’s own numbers the company owns almost twice the amount in circulation, or 61bn XRP.  A sense of security  As each contract expires, the cryptocurrency will briefly become available for Ripple to use as it sees fit.  Historically, Garlinghouse said funds have been spent at a rate of about 300m XRP per month for the past 18 months to incentivize market makers to offer tighter spreads for payments, methods he describes as Ripple being ""good stewards"" of the nascent XRP economy.  For example, he says funds have also been sold to institutional investors to help raise additional capital above the $93m already raised to help pay for engineers that oversee the open-source code base. Then, at the end of the month whatever XRP is unused will be added to the end of the escrow queue in the form of an additional month-long contract, starting the process all over.  A specific time-frame to implementation has not been revealed, but Garlinghouse expects the process to be completed by the end of this year. Head of research at Ripple investor Blockchain Capital, Spencer Bogart, said that if the contracts are safely implemented they could positively impact XRP user perception.  ""The fact that Ripple owns the majority of outstanding XRP and could potentially flood the market with supply has historically discouraged investors from evaluating XRP any further,"" he told CoinDesk. ""Properly implemented cryptographic escrow with sufficiently limited supply would go a long way toward alleviating that particular fear.""  Blockchain Capital does not currently have a stake in XRP, he said, but does own equity in the company.  More than speculation  Collectively, the total number of XRP in existence is worth about the same as the entire bitcoin market cap, elevating the stakes far beyond just cryptocurrency speculation in its own right.  In addition to the cryptocurrency's explosive growth over the past few months, the company that wants to make it easier for banks to send each other cross-border payments has continued to grow the number of its partners.  With the help of Germany’s former Minster of Defense who is an advisor to Ripple the company has been increasingly engaging global customers. For exmaple, the firm recently added 10 new financial firms to its network and completed a pilot with 47 global banks.  While Garlinghouse said the banks weren't among the XRP owners concerned about Ripple flooding the market with currency, he does believe that the more stable sense among open-source developers of liquidity being released into the wild could result in increased activity among the community.  In the end, the result could in fact trickle down to the banks as the end users, he said. The increased liquidity being created by the cryptocurrency safely entering the market could in turn make it easier for a larger number of banks to conduct transactions without negatively impacting the price of doing so.  Garlinghouse concluded:  ""I think increasingly, the market has realized that if we have a bank using us for messaging and settlements, there’s an opportunity to also introduce them to how they can lower their liquidity costs by leveraging a liquidity solution enabled through XRP.""

The bill, known as the ""Homeland Security Assessment of Terrorists Use of Virtual Currencies Act"", is set to be marked up on Thursday by the House Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, undergoing a process by which lawmakers will work on the text of a bill.  Authored by US Representative Kathleen Rice of New York, it reads:  ""Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Intelligence and Analysis...shall, in coordination with appropriate Federal partners, develop and disseminate a threat assessment regarding the actual and potential threat posed by individuals using virtual currency to carry out activities in furtherance of an act of terrorism, including the provision of material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization.""

42379464,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX885F7,1494940524,SEC Petition Calls for Blockchain Token Rules,"A New York-based broker-dealer has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to propose rules to cover blockchain-based assets.  According to the petition, Ouisa Capital wants the SEC to weigh in on the use of crypto tokens and resolve “the lack of regulatory clarity with respect to the regulation of digital assets and blockchain technology”.  The firm went on to write:  ""Ouisa encourages the SEC to engage in a meaningful discussion of how to regulate FinTech companies that are issuing digital assets that may be deemed securities and the platforms and broker-dealers that facilitate the issuance and trading of those digital assets. We believe digital assets in several contexts are securities and that existing laws provide a mechanism for regulation of the issuance and trading of digital assets.""  Additionally, Ouisa asked the SEC to create a so-called 'regulatory sandbox', through which startups and financial firms can test new products in limited settings.  Unlike other major regulators like the Internal Revenue Service (which views digital currencies as kinds of intangible properties) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (which views them as commodities), the SEC has yet to weigh in with any kind of classification for a blockchain token.  When contacted, the SEC declined to comment on the petition and whether it has begun the process of either developing regulations or responding to Ouisa's request.  Given its past moves related to the space – shooting down a pair of bitcoin exchange-traded funds while continuing to consider a third – such work wouldn't be surprising at this stage, however.  Further, recent comments from officials suggest that the agency is generally weighing the issue, invoking its aim of consumer protection at the same time.  During an appearance last week at the North American Securities Administrators Association Section 19(d) Conference, SEC Commissioner Kara Stein remarked on the impact of technology on her agency's work, noting ""we will need to adapt and make technology a bigger part of our mission"".  ""Similarly, I hope we continue to examine the range of possible uses of blockchain technology, while remaining mindful of vulnerabilities associated with potential cybersecurity risks and investor protection,"" she said.

42379472,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX885PB,1494937804,5 Ways Theme Parks Could Embrace Blockchain (And Why They Should),"Jegar Pitchforth is a statistician, data scientist and blogger with a background in complex systems analysis.  In this opinion piece, Pitchforth takes a tour of potential blockchain applications in the theme park industry, presenting five ways the summer entertainment staple could improve by using the tech.    ***    The theme park world has been known to embrace all forms of new technology, from virtual reality in rides to recommendation systems on mobile apps and the touchless payment technology that now pervades all major theme parks globally.  But while the methods of delivering the theme park experience are as advanced as they come in any industry, the systems behind all of it are sorely lacking. The experience of booking tickets and organizing the visit is often a lot more stressful than it needs to be, and anything that minimizes this process is likely to be well received.  Meanwhile, the digital world is undergoing a change in the way it stores information and makes financial transactions. A technology known broadly as 'blockchain' is gaining more and more attention amongst development circles, and it promises a new way of interacting with data altogether free of server costs or security issues.  You’ve probably heard of the first major application of the blockchain known as bitcoin – an entirely digital currency given value by those who use it.  But for all the hype you've heard about bitcoin, this is only the very pointy tip of a continent-sized iceberg. The next iteration of cryptocurrency is called ethereum, and its applications to the theme park world are far ranging.  1. Ticketing  Ticketing is probably the most obvious application of the blockchain to the operations of theme parks. There are already a range of interesting ethereum-based 'dapps' that promise ticketing services for music festivals and concerts at a fraction of the price.  Because the blockchain only ever allows one copy of a digital property (such as a ticket to a theme park), users can have a password-protected wallet on their phone that contains the digital tickets signed by the park which are scanned at the gate, at which time the payment transfer is finalized between the guest’s wallet and the theme park's.  No ID, no paper tickets, just a secure decentralized system approved by consensus.  What's more, these digital tickets don't have to be bought all at once or even by the same person. A guest who knows they want to go to the park a year out can make a promise to buy a ticket, which they can then pay off at their will over the remaining time they have. The blockchain can easily store the payment history of the guest without any specific human approval or oversight.  Now that your tickets are digital assets that you don't need to keep an eye on, you can pretty much allow people to do whatever they want with them.  Ethereum has the ability to run 'smart contracts' (executable code with instructions to carry out actions based on specific triggers), so any time someone sells on your park's tickets at a profit you can get a cut. Say you take 50% of any resales as part of the contract when you sell the ticket. On popular days that ticket might go through any number of hands, and you are making money each time without any effort, while also allowing others to make money from their good predictions.  2. Fastpass tracking and swaps  Similar to theme park ticketing, fastpass tickets for ride queues like this one at Universal, or the equivalent at Walt Disney World can be entirely controlled through smart contracts, giving them much more flexibility than the current systems.  The current system has a whole range of books and forums dedicated to how to game it, with people spending hours trying to get the best ride times and cover the rest of their favorite rides through careful planning. It surely doesn't need to be so stressful.  What if everything switched over to a bidding system with every guest given equal opportunity to start with?  You could provide guests with some tokens to spend on fastpasses when they buy a ticket, then use a demand-based system for the token cost of each ride in the park. The hardcore fans can spend all their tokens on the newest ride at the most popular times, while the kids can spend theirs on riding the Jungle Cruise for the five-millionth time.  Now that you've established a within-park market for ride times, there's nothing stopping you from selling additional tokens to guests buying premium packages, or to their relatives wishing them a good holiday.  The cool thing about this is that you get a lot more information about which rides people really wanted to go on, because you can track the 'price' and watch them trading with each other. This would let you start improving your recommendations to them, giving them indications of rides they might like and good times to ride them that suit their intended schedule.  3. Create a theme park currency  You can probably see where all this is heading: a theme park currency that can be used at any of the park owner’s subsidiary and affiliate businesses.  A majority of people that visit premium parks now download the app before they go so they can organize their day and use the map. It's not a great step for that app to become a digital wallet that visitors can use in your parks, stores and even online platforms. What makes this a digital currency rather than the old-school version of 'park dollars' is that these could be exchanged back into local currency anywhere someone wants to set up an exchange.  On its own, the prospect of having a future corporate currency that could be more stable than many local governments is interesting, but the immediate benefits are still compelling. Once you transfer your ticketing, fastpasses, merchandising and digital distribution payments through one channel that doesn't require a bank, your accounting suddenly becomes a lot simpler.  The concept is especially exciting for larger brands who may not have a park, but do have a store in a particular country.  The park currency can be used in all these stores without having to make special banking or business arrangements, allowing for much faster expansion into new markets. With incredibly low transfer costs between countries, theme parks that embrace blockchain would be able to capitalize on the post-visit experience much more effectively.  4. Audience surveys with meaning  One of the most popular early uses of the ethereum cryptocurrency was as a voting system. Rather than a 'one person one vote' approach, The DAO (the earliest manifestation of an ethereum organisation) used a share-based system where those with more coins had more vote.  While this may not be exactly what you want for your theme park, having a good knowledge of what the highest spenders in your park are looking for is a useful thing.  On top of that, you might also see a groundswell of grassroots support from lower-spending guests (like Universal saw with the opening of Harry Potter worlds in Florida), which would give you an indication that you need to build a ride with high throughput that doesn’t need a lot of stores nearby.  Whatever the outcome, an audience survey with the answers weighted by how much they have invested in your company is a lot more useful than standing around on corners asking people how they feel about things.  5. Turn everyone into an ambassador  Once you have your audience used to using your park's currency, and it's gained some value, there's more and more benefit to offering what are essentially cash rewards for advertising and information about your park.  This could be as basic as forwarding coins to a wallet linked to a Twitter account that posts lost of highly retweeted content, or as sophisticated as real-time rewards for advice about park waiting times, incident reports and events. There are already dozens of forums online vying to be the expert of one park or another, why not bring it all into your own app ecology and reward your guests for their effort?  You could create 'flashmobs' in the park with your most loyal fans by incentivizing them with tokens, as could any guest with enough tokens and approval from the park's digital protocols. There is no end to the ways people could build secondary and tertiary businesses around your brand, and with the right protocols you wouldn’t need to spend a cent on protecting it.  There's a massive range of ways which theme parks can use blockchain technology, and it’s exciting to imagine what the future might hold.  What other ways could theme parks use blockchain technology? Or should they be looking at this at all? Let us know in the comments below.  This article originally appeared on the author's blog, and has been republished here with his permission.

42379476,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX885Sx,1494934236,World's Biggest Tech Giants Could Boost Bitcoin in Regulatory Push,"While the cryptocurrency industry may see Apple and PayPal as competitors, those two tech companies are among a group pushing for regulatory reforms in the US that could provide a boost to the nascent industry.  For those that missed the news, Apple and PayPal have joined forces with Google, Amazon and Intuit in Washington, DC, to push for reforms to spur innovation in the financial system. Notably, a core item on their agenda is a federal money transmission license that would supersede the existing state-by-state regime.  Further, Financial Innovation Now (FIN), the lobby group representing the five companies, sent a letter to the Senate Banking Committee last month proposing a series of recommendations that, among other items, called for the establishment of a national money transmission requirement to be managed by the Treasury Department.  ""Consumer protection is a critical part of payments regulation, but it makes no sense for different states to regulate digital money differently from one state to another,"" the letter explained.  Brian Peters, executive director of FIN, stressed to CoinDesk the group is taking the money transmission issue seriously and is seeking a legislative solution.  He said:  ""This is a top priority for us. We're proactive pushing for it and we are serious about legislating this.""  Windfall benefit  While FIN admits it has no direct interest in advancing the digital currency ecosystem, it acknowledges the money transmitter issue is a common pain point.  ""None of our priorities really actually delve into bitcoin or the other cryptocurrencies specifically. However, a lot of what we are pushing for does connect to the work many in that community are doing,"" said Peters.  The group's rationale for pursuing such a reform, though, will surely resonate among those in the cryptocurrency space who have experienced similar headaches securing banking partnerships and other forms of access to traditional financial resources.  ""The main reason we are pursuing it is because our companies have encountered a significant amount of friction and delay in the state-by-state money transmission licensing process,"" Peters said, adding:  ""It's the delay and the friction that's really a hindrance to the ability to deliver products and services to the market in a way that is consistent with the pace of innovation in the modern economy.""  Such comments echo those that have long been put forth by innovators in the blockchain sector.  Martine Niejadlik, former chief compliance officer of Coinbase, for example, has said that bitcoin is being held back from its potential because of basic regulatory and licensing questions.  In addition to the costs of complying with scores of different sets of regulations, legal grey areas exist in states that have yet to decide whether bitcoin and other digital currencies should be considered money or be exempted from such regulations.  A federal licensing option that would allow cryptocurrency companies to circumvent state regimes could have an exponential growth effect on the industry, said Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center in Washington, DC.  Van Valkenburgh continued:  ""For people in the US who want to build a business using these technologies, by far the biggest impediment they face is state-by-state transmission regulations. There's pretty much no question about that. Anything that [FIN] is going to ask for – assuming it’s in line with a federal money transmission license – is exactly what our industry needs.""  Van Valkenburgh emphasized that having a federal option could provide windfall benefits in the form of reduced compliance costs for companies like Coinbase and lower barriers to entry for startups.  ""For startups, it’s the biggest thing,"" he said. ""Right now, you can't start your business unless you have millions to spend on compliance. And to get venture capital financing, you need to convince your venture capitalists that it's OK that the majority of their funding is going to lawyers.""  Political muscle  While there have been multiple efforts in the past two decades to create a federal money transmission framework, these endeavors have fallen short due to a lack of money, leadership and political clout, as well as pushback from state regulators keen to protect their turf.  FIN and its high-powered roster of big tech firms should encounter no such problems, explained Carol Van Cleef, a digital currency attorney with BakerHostetler in Washington.  Van Cleef told CoinDesk:  ""I have long said that we’ll get a national money transmitter license when these companies come together. They're the ones that have the resources necessary to launch the kind of legislative campaign that's essential to get this through Congress.""  ""This kind of initiative requires money and lots of it, solid executive branch and congressional relationships and experience working legislative issues,"" she added.  But with Congress and the political process as unpredictable as ever, there are no guarantees that any piece of legislation – regardless of who is backing it – can secure passage.  Even if they falter in that regard, companies like Google and Apple have significantly ramped up their Washington presence in recent years and have an undeniable ability to influence conversations and drive agendas across multiple levels.  These effects are already being felt, and all of this stands to potentially boost the cryptocurrency community, FIN's Peters said.  ""There is more conversation in Washington around how financial regulation deals with modern technology than I think anyone ever would have anticipated even a year ago,"" he said.  Not a panacea  Yet, legal experts are quick to point out that the creation of a federal licensing regime will hardly mean the end of all regulatory headaches for cryptocurrency companies.  ""A federal license or federal charter is not going to be a panacea because the price tag is going to be high,"" said Van Cleef, adding the actual burden of being regulated would likely not diminish either:  ""Depending on what regulator is assigned this task, that regulator is more than likely not going to be much more sophisticated than what we see in most states. Bank-like regulatory principals and expectations likely will be the starting point.""  The overall impact of a federal licensing scheme would also depend on the fate of important questions surrounding bitcoin that have yet to be settled – such as whether cryptocurrencies should be regulated in the same way as fiat money.  ""If we in the marketplace think cryptocurrencies should be regulated the way dollars are regulated, then this development would help facilitate the use of cryptocurrencies as a unit of exchange,"" said Joel Telpner, an attorney with Sullivan & Worcester in New York, adding:  ""But on the other hand, if we're not ready as a collective market to concede that cryptocurrencies should be regulated in the same way as fiat money, then this development may not help that much.""

Thrust into the spotlight by last year's US presidential election, the launch comes at a time when voters across the world have been awash in divisive information-dissemination practices as diverse as trolling, clickbait articles and spam.  However, the Polish startup is now building a blockchain solution it believes could help solve the issue by fixing what it says is the ""underlying cause"" of all these practices: the finite supply of human attention.  Maciej Olpinski, the co-founder and chief executive of Userfeeds, told CoinDesk:  ""In our view, the only way to fix these problems is to modify incentives that make it economically viable to produce and spread these types of content.""  Olpinski explained that, due to the economics of online publishing, it can sometimes make more sense for websites to produce low quality content that can be quickly converted into advertising dollars. Further, due to the closed nature of advertising and social media platforms, readers can never be sure who is behind messages in their news feeds.  The big idea behind Userfeeds is to create a credible system of content ranking that rewards users for their feedback. Built on the ethereum blockchain, it allows users to ""design voting systems to quickly gather feedback on important topics"" and ""reward users for actions taken within your application with your own currency"".  Olpinski said:  ""Blockchains and tokens are really interesting to us because they allow us to experiment with alternative economic incentives.""  To further progress its R&D work, Userfeeds has secured about $800,000 in seed funding from BY Capital, Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam and entrepreneur and investor Piotr Smolen.  According to the startup, the goal is to use the money to develop in-house apps that can help demonstrate the value proposition of platform.

According to state news service TASS, the startup, called Inspirasha, was purchased for an undisclosed amount. Although not much information exists publicly about the firm, business registration records point to a company with that name that works in the computing space.  In translated statements, Qiwi told TASS that the acquisition will boost its existing blockchain efforts.  QIWI, which made waves in 2015 for proposing a commodity-backed cryptocurrency later labeled the ‘BitRuble’, has since moved to integrate blockchain internally, as well as set up a subsidiary devoted to the tech earlier this year.

42379478,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX885VT,1494895225,Boost VC Will Now Invest Directly in Crypto ICOs,"Boost VC is opening up its portfolio to cryptocurrency startups in a whole new way.  One of the first  institutional investors to open its coffers to bitcoin startups in 2013, the San Mateo-based firm today revealed it will invest in so-called token sales or initial coin offerings (ICOs), new mechanisms increasingly being used to fund startup development but that have emerged as a lightning rod for controversy.  Initially seen as a potential threat to institutional investors, the announcement today marks the latest evidence that the sale of such software products – sometimes as securities, sometimes not – could offer an additional avenue for venture capitalists seeking returns.  In a blog post today, Boost VC co-founder Brayton Williams wrote:  ""We are looking for talented developers looking to build the next protocols of the internet. We are looking for entrepreneurs building the future of decentralized companies.""  Specifically, Williams wrote that Boost VC is looking for companies that are building low-level protocols to underlie a decentralized internet, creating less volatile cryptocurrencies, developing tools to help run distributed autonomous organizations or defining new governance models for such platforms.  Williams also expressed an interest in accepting other models as the industry evolves.  Selected companies will receive between $25,000 and $100,000 to help build out the runway to an eventual token sale, a process that will include the creation of actual code (which Williams hopes will help distinguish the offerings).  Over the past four years, Boost VC claims to have invested in more than 100 blockchain founders from a diverse set of firms, most recently joining an investment in cryptocurrency fund Polychain Capital and Aragon, a decentralized app for blockchain organizations.  Last week, Williams hinted in an interview with CoinDesk that such a development might be in the works, though his words today were perhaps more forceful in conveying the company's new market strategy.  Williams wrote:  ""Because our goal at Boost VC is to fund and accelerate cryptocurrency and blockchain founders, we are not trying to fight this new trend, we are ready to play our role.""
