42425865,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgVRh,1404254413,BitPay Seeks to Decentralize Digital Identification with BitAuth,"Georgia-based bitcoin merchant processor BitPay has launched a project that leverages bitcoin technology to facilitate a decentralized authentication system.  Called BitAuth, the system uses cryptographic signatures in place of server-side password storage. This solves a common security problem for IT administrators, because a breach can potentially leak customer authentication information.  Bitcoin core developer and BitPay employee Jeff Garzik conceived some of the concepts that made BitAuth a reality.  Garzik told CoinDesk:  ""Replacing passwords with digital signatures is not a very original idea. [But] digital identity is going to be a key technology for the future.""  The news follows BitPay’s previous foray into making technology improvements with cryptographic systems.  The company, which recently raised $30m in venture funding, released Bitcore in February, an open set of JavaScript libraries used to better interface with the bitcoin protocol.  How BitAuth works  BitAuth shares characteristics with bitcoin technology by using the same elliptic curve cryptography, but it introduces a system identification number (SIN), which is outlined on the Bitcoin Wiki.  Essentially, a SIN uses a cryptographic key pair to sign transactions with a server for authentication purposes.  With BitAuth, users would still authenticate with a conventional login and password combination. However, that information would only be stored locally, also known as client-side, and is only used to facilitate sending a private key to a remote server for access purposes.  To ensure that each authentication session is unique, every time a user releases a private key it is signed with a public key on a remote server and a nonce (a single-use randomized string) is generated as a session identifier.  Security issues  Web breaches exposing identifiable information have been a problem for large companies of late, as evidenced by major data losses affecting eBay, PF Changs, Target and Verizon. Furthermore, such events could potentially threaten the bitcoin industry.  Garzik said that BitAuth can reduce the issues that threaten digital identities, by attaching SINs to identities, or obscuring IDs with non-identifiable information.  Garzik told CoinDesk:  “[BitAuth] is as anonymous, or not, as you choose. At a minimum, public keys are revealed to external parties.”  Additionally, Garzik said that BitAuth's trustless properties can enable an improved experience for everyone:  “What makes the SIN proposal unique is that [they] are decentralized, as anonymous as you want them to be, digitally secure, capable replacements for website username/password, and most of all, extensible to any system that may be covered by hashes.""  Not just a concept  The announcement is also notable given the recent criticisms levied by developers regarding the lack of improvements to bitcoin's infrastructure. For example, experts like Mike Hearn have said that bitcoin as a software project is underfunded and needs attention to ensure continued progress.  BitPay’s Stephen Pair recently told CNBC that Visa and MasterCard will eventually ‘leverage’ bitcoin, a possibility that might be advanced by the creation of secure technical tools such as BitAuth and Bitcore for developers.  Those wishing to engage with BitAuth can now do so: BitPay has a GitHub repo dedicated to the project, and there is also a BitAuth chat room hosted on Gitter.

42425852,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgV3h,1404250419,Charlie Shrem to Address Banking Industry at New York Bitcoin Conference,"Former BitInstant CEO and noted bitcoin entrepreneur Charlie Shrem is set to give a talk at the upcoming American Banker Digital Currencies conference in New York on 29th July.  His discussion, entitled “Bitcoin Pitfalls - And How To Avoid Them”, will focus on Shrem’s colorful history with bitcoin, while putting a special emphasis on the challenges facing innovators.  Shrem's appearance at the conference in New York is notable considering his exit from Bitcoin in the Beltway late last month. Rumors that he was banned from the Washington, DC conference owing to legal problems were later dismissed by the entrepreneur.  Shrem  , who is currently facing federal money laundering charges, has become more active in digital currency circles after being released from house arrest in late May. Prior to the end of his house arrest, Shrem made limited appearances including a visit to the premiere of a bitcoin documentary in New York.  During his talk at the American Banker conference, Shrem plans on sharing his experiences as an early bitcoin entrepreneur trying to find stable banking partners.  He told CoinDesk:  “While running BitInstant, consulting with companies in the space and the Bitcoin Foundation, I went through many hardships on obtaining and maintaining banking relationships. It took me a long time to understand the risks involved for them, and how they would benefit from the relationship.”  Shrem added that, ultimately, he hopes to answer the question of why banks should work with bitcoin.  Role at Payza confirmed  In addition to the announced engagement, it has been confirmed that Shrem is working as a business development consultant for payments startup Payza.  The Wall Street Journal  reported that Payza is retaining Shrem for a “limited engagement”, telling the publication that Shrem brings “an exceptional knowledge of the bitcoin market” to the company. The development was first reported in May by newsBTC, though at the time Payza was unable to confirm whether Shrem was serving in an official capacity.  The company previously outlined its stance on digital currencies in a blog post from May. In the post, Payza suggested that bitcoin could be leveraged to afford its customers greater payment flexibility.  Ali Nizameddine, Payza’s executive vice president of product and technology, was quoted at the time as saying:  “We have a distinct vision of how we would like to incorporate Bitcoins into our platform. “The option that is most appealing is to allow our members to purchase Bitcoins with funds in their secure Payza accounts and to allow them to store their Bitcoins in their Payza ewallets or to transfer them to another wallet service.”  For more on Payza's plans in the bitcoin space, read the company's full blog posthttps://blog.payza.com/payza-updates/announcements/payza-exploring-options-bitcoin/.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/01/charlie-shrem-to-address-banking-industry-at-new-york-bitcoin-conference,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6a22c092c0302d0f8d38c9c414f58b87dbdf47ce-1251x505.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397712,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDzOG,1404247514,"US Marshals: One Auction Bidder Claimed All 30,000 Silk Road Bitcoins","UPDATE (2nd July 14:07 BST): Venture capitalist Tim Draper has been revealed as the winner of last Friday’s USMS bitcoin auction.      The US Marshals Service (USMS) has announced that a single, undisclosed bidder claimed all of the roughly 30,000 bitcoins seized from online black market Silk Road and sold in its recent auction.  The winning bidder outbid all other parties for the 10 auction blocks, according to the USMS. Further, the bitcoins have already been transferred to the winner, according to Blockchain.  The USMS previously said that it would begin notifying bidders as to whether they had secured any of the blocks on 30th June. The auction took place on Friday, 27th June over a 12-hour span.  In a statement, the USMS said:  ""The US Marshals Bitcoin auction resulted in one winning bidder. The transfer of the bitcoins to the winner was completed today.""  The auction was structured into 10 blocks, with the first nine consisting of 3,000 BTC and the last one featuring 2,656.51306529 BTC.  Results trickle in  The news follows an earlier announcement from the USMS on 30th June, when the agency said that 45 registered bidders took part in the process. At the time, the federal agency didn’t have a clear number on the final amount of winning bids.  The USMS released the auction date and procedural details last month. At the time, the federal agency outlined how participants could express interest in the roughly $18 million worth of bitcoin.  Since then, a number of key bidders, including SecondMarket founder and CEO Barry Silbert, have outlined their participation in the auction. Silbert later announced via Twitter that his auction syndicate, which consisted of 42 bidders for a total of 186 bids, was outbid on every bitcoin block.  The syndicate formed just part of a broader pool of known or possible bidders, a number of which were inadvertently released by the USMS. Other bidders included Pantera Capital and Bitcoin Shop, both of which have confirmed that they did not enter the winning bid.

42397723,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDzV9,1404245770,"Gallery: Robocoin, Italian Bitcoin Community Celebrate 'No Cash Day'","The fourth annual No Cash Day, a digital payment awareness initiative started by Italian lobbying group Cashless Way, took place in Rome on 27th June, with this year's event placing a special emphasis on bitcoin and its related technologies.  No Cash Day  found Cashless Way organising the second of two discussions on bitcoin that took place in Italy's House of Parliament this June, with the most recent including notable community members such as Robocoin CEO Jordan Kelley and Italian parliament member Sergio Boccadutri, who also served as the event's promoter.  Boccadutri has been increasingly active in the bitcoin space, even seeking to regulate bitcoin under existing Italian law earlier this year.  At the event, Boccadutri discussed how Italy is falling victim to a growing ""epayment divide"", citing statistics that suggest 86% of payments in Italy are still conducted in cash. By comparison, he said consumers in the UK and France conduct only 45% and 44% of payments with fiat currency, respectively.  Due to bitcoin's potential to help bridge this gap, Boccadutri used the event to call for parlimanet to conduct a public fact-finding survey about bitcoin and the companies in its ecosystem.  However, Boccadutri was far from the only notable speaker.  Consult Hyperion's Dave Birch spoke at the event, using his talk to address how digital currencies represent a ""tectonic shift"" in how payments will be delivered.  Alberto Naef  , head of global marketing at major European bank Unicredit Group, and Piero Crivellaro, vice president of public policy in southern Europe for MasterCard, were also on hand to address the crowd.  Robocoin debut  Bitcoin ATM manufacturer Robocoin was there, too, to celebrate what it called the launch of the country's ""first bitcoin ATM"", located at Luiss EnLabs, a leading Italian incubator housed inside Termini Station. Robocoin does not consider other competing one-way bitcoin ATM offerings as bitcoin ATMs, claiming the units lack the characteristic functionalities of traditional ATMs.  Following the launch, a spokesperson for Robocoin told CoinDesk that Kelley ""extolled bitcoin's virtues"" at parliament, while outlining the anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) capabilities of the company's technology.

42397731,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDze0,1404237614,HolyTransaction Bets Big on Universal Cryptocurrency Wallet,"Even with bitcoin prices surging in recent days, not everyone in the cryptocurrency industry is focusing solely on the success of its most popular digital currency.  HolyTransaction is a new cryptocurrency company that wants to be the market leader in the often speculative world of alternative digital currencies, and believes it stands to make big gains in the market by doing so. During a recent investor event at Plug and Play, Andrey Zamovskiy, CEO of HolyTransaction, told an audience the altcoin market is worth $30bn today by transaction volume, and that this number could be as high as $90bn by 2016.  To reach this market, HolyTransaction has built a wallet that allows users to exchange various altcoins in one place. But the company insists that it is not an exchange in the traditional way. Holy Transaction promotes an ethos of being the easiest way to store, and convert, a variety of altcoins.  Zamovskiy has been working on bitcoin-related technologies for many years, and finally came to the conclusion that building a wallet that can accept many cryptocurrencies is something the industry needs. Zamovskiy told CoinDesk:  “People essentially need a Coinbase for every cryptocurrency.”  Early struggles  However, the road to this realization was not an easy one for Zamovskiy. His first commercial bitcoin product came in 2011. Called BitMerch, it allowed businesses to accept BTC on websites.  Zamovskiy is from Ukraine, so most of his customer base for BitMerch was in Europe. And while he was able to sign up over 1,000 customers for BitMerch, the amount of bitcoin sales was very low. It quickly became clear to the entrepreneur that people were not spending bitcoin – because they didn’t even know what it was.  Zamovskiy said:  ""We realized the real problem of bitcoin is not acceptance but distribution within customers.""  Developing an altcoin wallet  Armed with this information, Zamovskiy attempted to start another business in Ukraine that would get people to buy bitcoin with credit cards, but even that presented a number of problems.  One was that the Ukrainian payment processor declined most international credit cards. Another was that obtaining bitcoin via cards presented a number of fraud issues – stolen cards could be used to obtain bitcoin, and then be fairly hard to track down.  It was made clear, due to these issues and others, that another business idea would be required. Zamovskiy realized he would need to move to America in order to grow a cryptocurrency business. After some more trial and error, he eventually started HolyTransaction and was accepted as a startup at the Plug and Play Accelerator in Sunnyvale, CA.  HolyTransaction currently makes money by charging its users 1% each time coins are exchanged within its wallet, and it plans to grow revenue as the altcoin market expands.  Wallets help a coin thrive  According to Coinmarketcap, there are currently 37 cryptocurrencies that have a market capitalization of more than $1m. To make decisions on what coins to include in its wallet, Holy Transactions relies on feedback from its userbase. The startup also monitors a site called CoinGecko, which measures market cap, social media shares, developer repository activity and other metrics to give coins a ranking score.  HolyTransaction thinks servicing top altcoins is important because many of them do not have sufficient wallet alternatives outside of a main client. Zamovskiy said:  “We are talking constantly with people in the community, and there are not enough wallet options.”  A lack of wallets can hurt an otherwise worthwhile coin, according to Zamovskiy. He pointed to namecoin and NXT in particular as alternative cryptocurrencies that struggle because of a lack of wallet choices. “NXT, for example, only has a client wallet. There’s no hosted wallet,” said Zamovskiy.  A wallet, not an exchange  Many altcoin investors use sites like Cryptsy to trade altcoins, and in theory, HolyTransaction is a potential competitor for those operating in this market. But when pressed, the company insisted it doesn't want to be an exchange, but more like a traditional bank that offers a number of currency options. Zamovskiy explained:  “It’s like when you go to the bank and wish to convert a currency. Banks don’t ask for your ask price, bid price. They just provide you with a flat rate.”  HolyTransaction wants to be known as a trusted wallet partner within the cryptocurrency community.  Instead of having to trust a shifting market flooded with coin (and wallet) options, investors can use the HolyTransaction platform to maintain safe storage, moving value in and out as needed.  Swapping coins  The altcoin market is almost always wavering on the whims of a brand-new coin reaching some new, lofty status, which often pushes some older coin down the ladder. Auroracoin is a notable example – there was a lot of hype surrounding this Icelandic-originated coin earlier this year, only for its price and subsequent interest to drop significantly.  Because of this, HolyTransaction will have to remain vigilant about keeping the most relevant coins part of its wallet. Right now, the company has six coins in its hosted wallet – bitcoin, blackcoin, dogecoin, darkcoin, litecoin and peercoin, and four more are to be added at some point in the future.  But, what will happen when a coin needs to be moved out of the top 10, effectively removing it from the wallet? The company has a solution for that, said Zamovskiy:  “[We] can’t expect the same 10 to always be at the top. We can use several strategies, but we would probably just send the encrypted private key to the user.”  Western banking and altcoin investors  Through Zamovskiy's knowledge of the intricacies of regulation, HolyTransaction has been able to land a partnership with Interac in compliance-friendly Canada, a feat also recently achieved by California-based expresscoin. The company has also completed its time at the Plug and Play incubator, and will set up its headquarters in the Bay Area, while maintaining an engineering office in Ukraine.  From this new location, HolyTransaction will provide a service it believes people need, because investors will continue to place faith (and money) behind alternative cryptocurrencies. Developers will keep making them, and money will flow into these coins.  “I believe that the majority of these [alternative] cryptocurrencies are by Russian developers,"" said Zamovskiy. ""[But] owners of theses currencies are usually based in the States, western countries.”  Coins image via Bitcoingarden",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/01/holytransaction-bets-big-on-universal-cryptocurrency-wallet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f21e7c35ba635def4546a57f53025d04ef9a4de-1200x500.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397724,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDzX7,1404233871,Why the OECD Needs to do its Homework on Bitcoin,"The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recently published a working paper on bitcoin and the implications of financial trust without intermediaries, authored by economist and Special Advisor to the Secretary-General on Financial Markets at the OECD, Adrian Blundell-Wignall.  Entitled ‘The Bitcoin Question: Currency Versus Trust-less Transfer Technology’, the paper represents one of the first official analyses on bitcoin in the context of contract law, legal tender, and plenary powers.  Besides grossly misunderstanding the economic nature of bitcoin, the general prescription for public policy would be disastrous, accelerating a 'parallel' monetary system faster than normal and simultaneously depriving millions of people of seamless participation.  The author fundamentally views bitcoin as something that must replace legal tender in order to be successful, so he is dismissive of bitcoin the monetary unit. Moreover, the author fears bitcoin more as a competitive alternative within a freedom-of-choice scenario and thus outlines policy behavior that attempts to extinguish any interface with established institutions.  However, monetary freedom has already arrived, demonstrating that the state's compulsory monopoly over money is unearned and unjustified. Government powers now need to be directed at removing hindrances for participation in alternative monetary units, because excluding large swathes of society from engagement with bitcoin exacerbates the problem of inevitable integration.  This article gives a critique of the general public policy prescriptions contained in the OECD working paper:  1. A general ban on cryptocurrencies in the interbank clearing system  Bans and prohibition are totally ineffective. A ban on bitcoin would increase global awareness for bitcoin, inspiring alternative and parallel clearing systems. This result would end up harming the existing clearing system even more and it would probably take the form of denying bitcoin a currency code such as XBT. Gold currently has code XAU within the ISO 4217 standards body.  2. Recognition that bitcoin the network is separable from bitcoin the unit  A bitcoin network separable from the bitcoin unit would be neither decentralised nor secure. The technology underpinning the bitcoin network is distributed and massively decentralised for a reason – it had to be immune to plenary power shutdown and strong enough to sustain an attack from outside computational power. The bitcoin unit provides the incentive for maintaining the security and integrity of the block chain, which makes it inseparable.  3. Best practice registration to verify the owner's identity  I am assuming that this recommendation is made only for the exchange endpoints that interface with national currencies (not merchants), thereby treating bitcoin exchanges like financial institutions. Physical cash transfers do not typically demand owner identity verification, but of course when an exchange business is involved, the operating jurisdiction defines the required conditions around getting in and out of national fiat currency. In some jurisdictions, this best practices registration may be conducted on an opt-in basis.  4. Balance sheet and income statement reporting for all networks  Again, I am assuming exchange networks because the bitcoin block chain is already a publicly accessible transparent ledger of transactions. Market competition will demand exchange solvency and reporting of financial status.  5. Mandatory capital should be held by exchanges (in the form of legal tender)  Jim Harper, Global Policy Counsel at the Bitcoin Foundation, suggests that consumer protection may differ in the future bitcoin era as the assumption of government regulation providing sophisticated commercial oversight becomes challenged.  Cryptographic proof of reserves can deliver responsible public audits of exchange assets as bitcoin's cryptography-based public ledger allows an organization to prove control of bitcoin assets without revealing private information about customers or account holders.  Harper continues, ""multisignature transactions are a second innovation that may remake consumer protection. 'Multisig' allows any combination of consumer and business entities to exercise control over a bitcoin-based asset.""  ""These innovations, and others to come, will tend to make consumer oversight of bitcoin businesses easier – and government oversight a less important part of the mix. Consumers will be better positioned to do their own monitoring and, in the best case, to enjoy cryptographic proof that they are being properly served.""  6. Implement some form of backing for cryptocurrencies, such as gold  Requesting gold backing for bitcoin is one of the rookie mistakes made by new analysts, because the transportation costs, audit issues, and potential confiscation are all issues that bitcoin seeks to bypass. A gold-backed bitcoin would lead to centralisation in the way of specie reserves and would irreparably damage the incentive structure for securing the distributed block chain, which includes the process of new bitcoin issuance.  Despite the fact that our working paper author appears to support gold, he is mostly an apologist for ‘The State Theory of Money’ myth that the sovereign’s power to collect taxes and declare legal tender imbues a currency with ultimate value. Bitcoin is the primary value unit and requires backing from neither state sanction nor gold. I recently attempted to explain that logic to legal-tender poster boy Paul Krugman, in 'The Fiat Emperor has no Clothes'.  7. Use of government plenary powers to restrict contracts in bitcoin  Given today's cryptographic protocols and smart contracts with time-release amounts and multisignature transactions, it is simply infeasible to restrict private party contracts that would not require the judicial system. Potentially, contracts could be banned by statute within aggressive jurisdictions, but that would probably only drive them underground.  Blundell-Wignall references the 1935 gold clause cases where the Supreme Court decided in a 5:4 majority in all of these cases that ""the power to regulate money is a plenary power"". The author concludes that ""the abrogation of all gold clauses was considered to be within the powers of Congress when such clauses presented a threat to Congress’ control of the monetary system."" He then posits that ""if bitcoins begin to undermine the financial and tax systems they will be shut down and all contracts between traders would be unenforceable.""  According to law professor Henry Mark Holzer, the abrogation of gold contracts and gold clauses during the Roosevelt administration in the US marks one of the saddest periods in worldwide monetary history, because it restricted freedom to transact.  Market-based legitimacy  Ironically, the items that the author highlights with respect to legal tender and monetary contracts are precisely what the bitcoin protocol alters with its 'trustless transfer technology.' Governments will no longer maintain a monopoly position over money because an alternative exists and that alternative does not rely on legal tender status for its legitimacy – it relies on global acceptance of the mathematics behind the protocol for its market-based legitimacy.  The implications of bitcoin are quite simply ""Money Without Government."" We don't need kings to coin our money. Trust has become decentralised.  The die has been cast. All that remains is the jurisdictional competition to determine if any nation-state has the political will to harness and benefit from nonpolitical money.  Follow the author on Twitter.

42397727,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDzZ5,1404230667,"Bitcoin Ads for Beyoncé, Jay-Z Concert Go Live This Week","The Chicago Sun-Times is set to launch the first bitcoin-enabled QR code advertisements this week.  The ads, which will first appear on 2nd July, allow readers to make direct purchases of tickets for an upcoming concert featuring famed hip-hop power couple Beyoncé and Jay-Z.  The Chicago-based newspaper teamed up with Coinbase and Blockchain on the digital currency initiative. Ticket broker Golden Coast Tickets will be handling the actual purchases.  The Sun-Times first began integrating bitcoin in February. At the time, it was the first major US newspaper to begin accepting bitcoin payments. Overall, the effort has netted the company new subscriptions, a result that contributed to the announcement of the bitcoin-enabled advertisements in May.  The initiative demonstrates a potential new way forward for the world of advertising, with implications for the time and context of consumers purchase decisions. As well, bitcoin-enable advertisements could open up new revenue streams for media organizations as well.  Blockchain CEO Nic Cary echoed the sentiment that the Sun-Times project presents a new avenue for transactions, saying:  “Our core mission is to reimagine how the world transacts. When Chicago.com approached us we were very excited to participate. We're eager to inspire unique experiences that would not otherwise be possible without Bitcoin.”  Consumer-friendly advertisements  Notably, concert-goers who opt to pay through the advertisements have the opportunity to get significant discounts if they act early.  There are three categories for tickets. The first eight tickets for each category will be sold at a 25% discount, a noticeable difference considering that the most affordable tickets for the Beyoncé/Jay-Z show sell for $450. Those unable to buy the tickets in time can still benefit from up to a 10% discount on the listed ticket price.  The advertisements are designed to be simple to use, and instructions are included for those who may be less familiar with the operational aspects of digital currency.  Josh Metnick, chief technology officer for the Sun-Times’ parent companny Wrapports, told CoinDesk that ultimately, ads like the ones for the Beyoncé/Jay-Z concert could result in more people learning about bitcoin. He predicted that bitcoin-enabled advertisements, if successful, will likely become more common, saying:  “I don’t see this type of commerce going away. It’s the first attempt at it, but it’s just going to get easier and easier.”  Growing impact on print  In addition to providing a new avenue for bitcoin to be spent and discovered, the bitcoin advertisements hold the potential for creating additional revenue streams for newspapers.  Metnick remarked that while the concept is new, all forms of print may one day feature built-in bitcoin payments integration. This includes airplane tickets, flyers hung up on the sides of buildings or even billboards.  He said:  “This could implicate all print.”  It remains to be seen what impact digital currency will continue to have on newspapers, and the Sun-Times in particular. When the Sun-Times first proposed the bitcoin-enabled QR code ads, Metnick told CoinDesk the newspaper may experiment with other forms of bitcoin acceptance.  At the time, Metnick suggested that altcoin support, as well as direct author tipping, could form part of future digital currency initiatives.

42397717,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDzPF,1404226639,First Trezor 'Classic' Hardware Wallets Could Ship This Month,"Hardware wallet manufacturer SatoshiLabs says it is ""on track"" to start shipping the first Trezor 'Classic' wallets to customers by the end of July.  Initially, the company will fulfil early pre-orders, it adds, but, as soon as there is sufficient stock, SatoshiLabs will open its e-shop for regular sales.    Hardware wallets are dedicated devices aimed to more securely store bitcoins. Their advantage stems from the fact that, since they don’t connect to the Internet, they offer greatly reduced exposure to potential hackers or malware.    Production delays  SatoshiLabs  has faced a number of issues with the plastic Classic version of its wallet.  At the time, the company pinned the blame on a dispute with its original hardware partner, which has since been replaced by a “well known automotive and lighting industry supplier” with an annual revenue of $100m.  The SatoshiLabs team had a bit more luck with the pricier Trezor 'Metallic' wallet, and pre-ordered units started shipping a couple of months ago.  The company has not yet revealed what it plans to charge for the wallets once it starts taking orders. Metallics shipped so far will have been pre-ordered units paid for with bitcoin during a previous crowd funding campaign that was closed prematurely, along with the option to pre-order.  Prototype testing  According to the company blog, the first batch of plastic cases for Trezor Classic units (pictured above) was presented during a tour of the production facility earlier this week. The next step will be to integrate the hardware and test complete units.  “In following days, the first testing batch of 100 pieces will be produced and completed.

The machines will be distributed on the island and further afield in the UK. The first locations have already been secured and the company is in talks with Isle of Man regulators about the rollout.  UK rollout coming soon  QwikBit is incorporated in the Isle of Man, and remains confident that local regulators will approve its plans.  “We’ve been looking forward to the arrival of our first batch of Bitcoin AVMs for several weeks. In that time, we’ve been working on securing our first locations in the Isle of Man, and also liaising with Jason Kelly, a specialist lawyer and Vice Chairman of the Manx Digital Currency Association (MDCA), who has provided invaluable insight on local regulatory matters,” says Stan Ho, COO of QwikBit.  If all goes well, the company will proceed to install additional machines in the UK.  Ho explains:  “Following the Isle of Man’s Financial Supervision Commission (FSC) announcement on Digital Currency, Qwikbit has also been liaising with the FSC regarding our launch. Once we have the green light, we’ll install a number of AVMs in the Isle of Man, and then roll out the rest of this batch in the UK.”  Isle of Bitcoin  Lamassu says it is “very excited” by the Isle of Man launch and it is looking forward to the UK rollout.  “This is a big step towards making Bitcoin more accessible in the Isle of Man and in the UK,"" said Zach Harvey, CEO of Lamassu.  Charlie Woolnough, Chairman of the Manx Digital Currency Association, said the arrival of QwikBit machines represents another step forward towards making bitcoin accessible to the general public and establishing the Isle of Man as “a domicile of choice for crypto-currency businesses”.  The Isle of Man already has a good reputation when it comes to liberal business practices. The MDCA and other bitcoin proponents want to extend these liberal policies to digital currencies and turn the British Crown dependency into a bitcoin-friendly jurisdiction.

With the decision, 1-800-Flowers becomes one of the largest merchants to enter the bitcoin space, boasting $735m in total net revenuehttp://files.shareholder.com/downloads/FLWS/3283008674x0x715238/E255297E-FC2C-4A1F-8DA1-30AC9A6EA4BB/FLWS_2013_annual_FINAL.pdf in 2013.  Jim McCann, CEO and founder of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, framed the partnership as an extension of the company's overall focus on customer service, stating:    ""As a customer-centric company, we are always looking for new ways to engage with our customers and enhance their shopping experience for all of their celebratory occasions. Bitcoin, together with our other payment options, offers our customers another highly convenient way to help them deliver smiles to the important people in their lives.""            The announcement marks the latest major retailer to accept bitcoin following the recent announcements by Overstock, DISH and Expedia, all of whom also accept bitcoin via merchant processing services offered by California-based Coinbase.  In comparison to 1-800-Flowers, subscription TV service provider DISH, Internet-based travel website Expedia and online retailer Overstock, see $13.9bn, $4.8bn and $1.3bn in yearly revenue.  Customer-first approach  1-800-Flowers sees the majority of its annual revenue – 56% – from floral purchases, while 33% comes from its gourmet food and gift basket items.  Still, recent indications are the company is looking for new and novel ways for consumers to make those purchases. In its 2013 annual report, Jim McCann and president Chris McCann pledged to focus on social and mobile initiatives, stating:  ""Our marketing initiatives that are designed to engage directly with our customers – increasingly through the fast evolving social and mobile channels, to deepen our relationships with them and help them deliver smiles.""  As such, the statements suggest that bitcoin may be a natural extension for the company given these aims. 1-800-Flowers reported reaching 4.9 million customers in 2013, an increase of 2.3 million over the course of the calendar year.  Given bitcoin's ability to attract customers to Overstock and TigerDirect, the technology could also help 1-800-Flowers boost its new customer acquisitions in 2014.  High-tech history  Purchased in the late 1980s by New York area flower shop owner Jim McCann, 1-800-Flowers has long kept a close eye on cutting-edge technologies, using them to grow the company at key intervals.  For example, the company rose to prominence to due to timely advertisements on cable-TV news networks in the early 1990s, and forged early partnerships with CompuServe and AOL.  1-800-Flowers changed its name to 1-800-Flowers.COM when it went public in 1999, and retains the name to this day.

42397722,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDzW8,1404218890,"Expresscoin Expands Into Canada, Offers Debit Card Payments","Digital currency retailer expresscoin has launched a Canadian branch of its business, in the first phase of its expansion beyond the US market.  Expresscoin  , which is based in Santa Monica, California, offers customers the opportunity to buy bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin and blackcoin with debit cards, while importing wallet addresses from other services into their accounts.  Its Android app lets users manage their accounts and wallets, and track both orders and balances from their mobile devices.  The firm's CMO and co-founder Joseph Hsieh told CoinDesk:  “This is our first step into another market other than the United States. We thought that if we can get our process and make headway in the US market, then other countries should be a lot easier. [The move into Canada] is part of our overall mission to make bitcoin (and other digital currencies) accessible to the mass consumer audience.”  There had been a lot of demand from potential customers in Canada, as well as other markets, but the minimal language barrier proved a key deciding factor, he explained.  Hsieh added:  ""Moving beyond that, it's interesting, because bitcoin may seem big to those of us in the industry, [but] it's still very small and early.""  Fast, easy payments  Notably, the Canadian arm of the company will allow customers to purchase digital currencies using standard debit cards via DebitWay – a service which accepts all cards issued from the most popular banking networks.  DebitWay allows merchants access to INTERAC online payment services. This, in turn, lets consumers securely pay for goods and services online, in real-time and directly from their bank account.  Fast transaction times have meant expresscoin has had to up its game in terms of customer service, said Hsieh.  ""Because it's near real-time,"" he explained, ""we have to up our customer response times and be right there when customers need us or have any problems. [...] If you were to make a wire transfer, the customer can tolerate a longer response time since the wire transfer still needs to clear, but with INTERAC, we expect and want to be there when problems happen.""  Regulated environment  As recently as 19th June, Canada amended existing laws to allow the regulation of ""virtual currencies"", which likely includes bitcoin.  Although further legal moves are necessary before the bill is enforceable, some businesses in the digital currency space are likely to face new reporting and licensing issues. However, being regulated may bring advantages, such as easier access to the traditional banking system.  CoinDesk asked Hsieh if the new legislation affected his company's decision to move into the Canadian arena.  ""The process [of setting up the Canadian side of the business] took several months,"" he said. ""So it wasn't a direct [cause] of us going into Canada, just a convenient coincidence that they are making it easier for bitcoin startups and companies. We've been registered with FINTRAC (Canadian's version of FinCen) for a while, as it was a requirement from our banking relationship and DebitWay.""  Blockchain relationship  Noted wallet service Blockchain provides an overview of bitcoin and bitcoin-related services for new consumers on its sister site Bitcoin.com. Significantly, expresscoin features on the site as a go-to company for the purchase of bitcoin.  ""Our inclusion in Bitcoin.com is based on our strong relationship with Blockchain,"" said Hsieh. ""We know Dan Held [the company's director of product] very well, [and] worked with him in the past on some advertising initiatives in ZeroBlock.""  ""Blockchain is a preferred wallet for our consumers. We don't have an in-house wallet system (yet), because we don't want to be custodians of users' private keys.""

42397728,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDza4,1404217231,Online Retail Giant Newegg Now Accepts Bitcoin,"Popular online computer hardware and software retail giant Newegg has announced it is now accepting bitcoin as a payment option – a move that had been widely anticipated by its customers.  The Los Angeles-based company, which recorded $2.8bn in annual revenue in 2013, made the announcement today, saying it will use BitPay as the payment processor to convert bitcoin sales into US dollars.  In a statement, the company's Chief Marketing Officer Soren Mills proclaimed that Newegg and bitcoin are a fit – primarily because of its customers' early adopter mentality:  “Newegg’s customers are among some of the earliest bitcoin miners and are enthusiastic proponents of the cryptocurrency. Adopting bitcoin as a payment method is another way we’re responding to our customers’ diverse needs.""  Calls for integration  Newegg’  s bitcoin curiosity has been talked about for months, with 'teaser' responses on Twitter when its followers raised the issue of the company accepting bitcoin.    Still waiting for an update, but will let you all know as soon as we receive word! RT @TheIanMerrill: @Newegg do you take #bitcoin yet?      — Newegg (Official) (@Newegg) January 9, 2014    ""Our customers have been reaching out to us on Facebook and Twitter asking for us to accept bitcoin,"" Mills told CoinDesk. ""Prior to the actual integration, we spent several months conducting due diligence to ensure a smooth transition once we decided to move forward.""  The online retail industry has slowly been opening the doors to bitcoin buyers since late last year. Newegg's direct competitor TigerDirect began accepting bitcoin in January, following Shopify's addition of the digital currency as a payment option for its vendors back in November 2013.  Overstock also opened up to bitcoin payments via Coinbase on 10th January, a good six months ahead of schedule.  Choosing BitPay  Like TigerDirect and Shopify, Newegg decided to partner with BitPay as its payment processor for bitcoin transactions.  The Atlanta, Georgia-based company recently raised $30m in venture capital, and currently processes over $1m a day in bitcoin payments for merchants. BitPay takes bitcoin and converts it to cash for its customers.  Mills said:  “Working with BitPay to implement a bitcoin payment option at Newegg was a seamless process and our partnership gives us the capabilities we require for high-volume e-commerce.”  Newegg pointed out BitPay's reliability and scalability as factors in choosing the company as its bitcoin payment processor.  BitPay competes with processors such as Coinbase and GoCoin for merchant business. These bitcoin payment processors make money from charging fees, although the amount levied is much lower than that demanded by credit card processors.  Growing acceptance  Overstock's bitcoin sales figures have been healthier than many had predicted. By March, it had announced $1m in sales from payments made in the cryptocurrency and expects to pull in $20m in BTC sales by the end of 2014.  The popularity of bitcoin payments at the company have been a surprise, even to its CEO Patrick Byrne.  Newegg, which sells computer hardware and software, expects to see a sales uptick in certain product categories as a result of its bitcoin integration.  In fact, it was equipment that could be used in cryptocurrency mining that solidified the company's decision to take the digital currency as a form of payment.  Mills told CoinDesk:  ""We already offer gear that's commonly used in bitcoin mining – items such as specialized video cards, motherboards, cases and cooling accessories. In fact, this is another way we assessed that our customers were ready to make purchases using bitcoin.""  Companies with sales volumes like Newegg and TigerDirect go some way to silence two of the main criticisms of bitcoin as a retail form of payment.  One was that the block chain would not scale to cope with large numbers of transactions. The other being that payment processors like Coinbase and BitPay wouldn't be able to deal with price volatility once billion-dollar businesses signed up.  However, ""once we brought BitPay in to help us with the integration, the process was very straightforward,"" Mills pointed out.  Fast-expanding market  Forbes lists Newegg as the 172nd largest private company in the United States. Founded in 2001, it currently has 2,600 employees and has been profitable every year of its existence.  The company filed an IPO application in 2009, but changed its mind shortly after and formally withdrew the application in 2011, saying it would pursue other funding options.  The company is a favorite of self-build hardware fans, and regularly tweets photos of its customers' rigs on the official Newegg Twitter feed.  Consumer electronics are the most lucrative segment of a rapidly growing online retail market, which is worth about $43.8bn a year in the US alone, according to MarketLine – 21.9% of an overall $200.4bn total in web sales.  Thanks to a partial reprieve from state sales taxes and changing consumer habits, online retail is projected to reach $371.4bn annually by 2017, according to Forrester Research.  Demand for bitcoin  As one of the longest-running and most popular computer-related retailers online, there has been a lot of demand for Newegg to start accepting bitcoin.  While it could serve as a financial boon for the company, it is also certainly smart marketing.  In a statement, BitPay Executive Chairman Tony Gallippi said:  “Newegg has been the most requested retailer from the bitcoin community and our collaboration will serve this pent-up demand.”  Soren Mills believes finally getting on board with bitcoin as a payment method will boost Newegg's revenue, although he's not making any promises.  ""It's difficult to speculate on [increased sales], but I suspect that our ability to accept bitcoin will fuel revenue growth, rather than simply replacing sales that would otherwise have been executed using US dollars,"" he said.

42397709,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDzLJ,1404213038,"Coinbase Android Apps Have Security Flaw, Expert Warns","A Canadian programmer has published what he claims is a vulnerability in Coinbase's Android apps, one that could allow an attacker to gain full access to a user's account.  Software Engineer Bryan Stern went so far as to caution users not to use the Coinbase Bitcoin Wallet and Merchant apps for Android until the problem is fixed, and advised them to check their accounts for suspicious activity.  However, the company has since responded to Stern in a reddit thread stating that the vulnerabilities were not as serious as Stern claims.  Stern  , who works on Android development at Hootsuite, said he'd brought the issue to Coinbase's attention via their 'white hat' bug bounty program in early March, but there had been a disagreement over the seriousness of the issue.  Upon finding his issue present in the latest version of the app, he decided to release the information publicly on 27th June in the hope that prompt action would be taken.  He wrote:  ""I don't mean any harm posting this, but I am frustrated that some security fixes that might require maybe 20 [development] hours to implement and is allegedly on the roadmap 3 months ago has not yet been addressed.""  The issue at hand  A lower level of security in the Android apps could allow eavesdroppers to launch a 'man in the middle' (MITM) attack against users, Stern said. He wrote in his report:  ""Coinbase wisely recommends that all clients of their API should validate the SSL certificate presented to prevent MITM attacks. However, they fail to do this in their own Android applications.""  Thanks to this, an attacker could present a 'spoofed' SSL certificate (anything with a valid signature but from a different signing authority to the one Coinbase uses) and intercept communications.  The client_id and client_secret items, part of the application's API that should be secret, are in clear view in Coinbase's source code published on GitHub, Stern continued. These would then be revealed during a user's authentication process and provide a hacker with the all-important access_token.  With an attack established, plus this stolen token, a malicious hacker could make API requests at a later time on the user's behalf – essentially taking full control over their account.  Stern recommended Coinbase change client_id and client_secret and keep them confidential in future. He also recommended all apps validate SSL connections properly, and that they make use of the Coinbase API's improved authentication process and stop using the deprecated one.  Coinbase  said the threat was a minor one only, and an attack could only be performed successfully under a specific, but unlikely, set of circumstances.  Client_id and client_secret were intended to be public and not defenses against hack attacks, a company representative said, and while SSL Pinning might help against some attacks, it was not a defense against all malware or local modification of certificates.  Bug bounty program  After having his claims initially rejected by Coinbase on 14th March, Stern then wrote a draft blog post warning the public about the issue and sent it to the company in April.  This too was rejected, so he opened a report on HackerOne, a site where ethical hackers dissatisfied with existing bounty programs can disclose vulnerabilities privately.  Coinbase paid Stern $100 but said it would not be fixing the issue, leading HackerOne to make the report public. When he found the issue still not fixed in the latest version (2.2) of Coinbase's apps, Stern decided to publish the report on his blog.  Coinbase's bug bounty program pays a minimum $1,000 in bitcoin to anyone who can find a valid security hole in its code, but the company ""reserves the right to decide if the minimum severity threshold is met"".  The company in April responded to claims in March that its 'Request Money' feature left users vulnerable to phishing attempts. The feature allowed a user to find out if an email address was attached to a Coinbase account by entering it into a search field.
