Originally raised as an issue on Github, the Big Sur update is bricking MacOS Electrum clients, a bitcoin software wallet that is a favorite of power users because of its complex tooling and user controls. The Electrum team announced today that a new release fixes the issue.      “Currently, the latest release of Big Sur has completely broken Electrum [for Mac devices]. You can’t open the app or load any of your wallets,” one Electrum user, Nico, told CoinDesk.      The issue was opened on Electrum’s Github on Aug. 1, around the time Apple released Big Sur’s beta.      While the “root cause is still unknown,” Electrum developer SomberNight said in the Github issue page, it’s related to Big Sur’s treatment of Python, the coding language in which Electrum is written.      To work around the problem, Electrum users can run the software from source (that is, by manually compiling the source code) or they can bundle an older version of Python into their software. The Electrum team’s fix incorporates the latter solution.    For Bitcoin, Apple’s problems hit home    The snafu is the first case of Apple’s latest release disrupting the Bitcoin realm, but it’s not the first time the update has caused issues.      Upon the version 11.0 release last week, an error in Apple’s servers caused worldwide shutdowns of Mac hardware running the update. These servers process OCSP requests, or the data packets that verify user credentials for applications.      Mac users soon discovered the Big Sur update and the error were related. Big Sur sends OCSP requests for every online and offline application that a user opens, and if these requests fail then the computer fails, too.      This activity logging feature has been present since Apple’s Catilina update, but Big Sur makes it so Mac users can’t trick the feature with firewalls and VPNs as they once could.      These requests are transmitted unencrypted, raising privacy concerns over how this data may be intercepted and used by third parties. From the perspective of a Bitcoin user, this feature would broadcast every time a wallet, coin mixer or other Bitcoin-related service is used on his or her device.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | TECHNOLOGY,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/18/electrum-developers-apply-fix-after-apple-update-bricks-bitcoin-wallets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d2813b7306035b7542df38100b1a6c403529cbbd-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385140,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnNZv,1605741108,Duality Technologies Launches Platform for Analyzing Big Data While Keeping It Private,"Encryption may not seem sexy, but it’s never been more important.      Duality Technologies, a provider of privacy-enhancing tech, (PETs), is launching SecurePlus Statistics, a privacy-enhanced “statistical analysis solution” that uses Homomorphic Encryption (HE).      While it may sound dry, it marks a step forward in practical uses of HE, which lets multiple actors conduct data analysis on a variety of datasets while keeping that information encrypted and protecting things like personally identifiable information.      “HE is relevant for any industry dealing with highly sensitive data, such as health care and the financial services industry, but other regulated industries such as telecom, insurance and academic research that involves personal data, can also benefit from HE applications,” said Dr. Alon Kaufman, CEO and co-founder of Duality, in an email.      “In financial services industries, HE can facilitate privacy-enhanced, collaborative financial crime investigations across firms and legislations, by enabling institutions to share information and insights while complying with privacy regulation.”    What is homomorphic encryption?    HE lets math calculations be done on data in its encrypted form. The result of the calculations is also encrypted, but when the result is decrypted it is identical to the result had the data not been encrypted in the first place.      So if data is sent to a commercial cloud, large-scale analysis can be done on it without putting sensitive information such as people’s medical or financial information at risk.      In encryption, plaintext is converted to ciphertext, or its encrypted form. Ciphertext can be converted back to plaintext, but only by certain parties possessing a secret key that decrypts the information using that secret key.      Read more: Community Behind Privacy-Focused Smart Contract Forges Ahead After Settlement      In traditional forms of encryption, data is only protected in storage and during communications. In the case of HE, which is named for homomorphisms in algebra (or the ability to mirror the operations on one algebraic structure with operations on another), analysis can be done without access to that secret key which would decrypt the information.      When thinking of HE, said Kaufman, imagine placing the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, representing your data, in a box. Then you lock that box using encryption and hand it to somebody else. This person is actually able to assemble the puzzle (run analytics on your data) without unlocking the box and seeing the pieces, because the box is still encrypted. You then receive the box back and unlock it to see the assembled puzzle, or the encrypted results that you then decrypt.      “In this way, Homomorphic Encryption enables computations, including advanced analytics and Machine Learning, on encrypted data, assuring data privacy throughout the analytics cycle,” said Kaufman in an email to CoinDesk. “Homomorphic Encryption allows multiple parties to collaborate on data without seeing each other’s data assets, thus generating valuable insights from them.”    Why homomorphic encryption matters now    In a world where privacy concerns are advancing, particularly amid the pandemic, and disparate privacy laws are resulting in countries revoking some form of data access to others, tools like HE could give companies a way to get data insights without creating the potential not just for non-compliance, but also for big data abuse that has driven concerns about Big Tech.      Earlier this year researchers showed how HE can enable analysis on genomic data in such a way that it preserves data privacy. Such analysis can help us understand complex or novel diseases, such as COVID-19.      Duality piloted SecurePlus Statistics at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center in Israel where it was used to analyze data regarding the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer studies while protecting personal health information.      Read more: EU Privacy Shield Ruling Is an Opportunity and Conundrum for Decentralized Tech      Numerous proposals have also been written for how HE could benefit blockchain-based projects. One paper, published in 2019, proposed using HE to protect sensitive data generated from the ever-expanding internet of things (IoT).      “Previous blockchain-based IoT systems have issues related to privacy leakage of sensitive information to the servers as the servers can access the plaintext data from the IoT devices,” reads the abstract. “So, we present the potential of integration of blockchain based-IoT with homomorphic encryption that can secure the IoT data with high privacy in a decentralized mode.”      Another proposal, published earlier this year, experimented with applying blockchain technology in edge computing to improve edge computing’s performance of secure storage and computation. The researchers introduced HE as a way to ensure the “noncorrelation, anonymity and supervision of identity privacy in blockchain systems,” and found promising results they said would lay the groundwork for future research.      “Privacy-preserving data collaboration – even among competitors – is also important in solving other global challenges, such as fighting different types of cyber and financial crimes that are committed by increasingly sophisticated global networks,” said Kaufman.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/18/duality-technologies-launches-platform-for-analyzing-big-data-while-keeping-it-private,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5563328379706b4ad1b03763c709499d245256c9-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The round, led by Chinese venture capital firm Sino Global and with participation from D1 Ventures, Block Oracle Capital, Arweave and angel investors, is meant to help Mintbase stand out from a growing pack of NFT platforms.      “Being a marketplace is really an afterthought,” Mintbase CEO Nate Geier said in an interview. “The goal was to build the best minter out there, and we did that.”      The new funding allows the team to actively hire developers and designers to prepare for a testnet launch on NEAR before the end of this year. Building on NEAR will be in addition to its continued work on Ethereum. Geier also hinted that a governance token may be in the works.      What differentiates Mintbase from similar NFT marketplaces such as SuperRare, Rarible or OpenSea, Geier says, is the lack of focus on one specific category of NFT.      “They get more publicity and we get more usage,” he added, pointing out that many people log onto Mintbase to mint their NFTs only to trade them on OpenSea.

42385132,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnNTd,1605740294,Tor Developers Pursuing ‘Anonymous Tokens’ to Stop Hacks and DoS Attacks,"The privacy-oriented browser Tor (The Onion Router) is researching ways “anonymous tokens” could counter Denial of Service (DoS) attacks – a pressing issue for the network.      Tor has been subject to DoS attacks, degrading its performance. While there are technical fixes Tor has worked to implement, the nature of the network and the anonymity of the traffic on it make it particularly susceptible to DoS attacks.      In August, Tor introduced the idea of using anonymous tokens to counter such attacks, allowing them to differentiate between “good” and “bad” traffic, and to avoid implementing user accounts, which most sites and networks use to identify traffic and bad actors.      During last week’s “State of the Onion” address, when the Tor team gave updates on projects and forecasted new developments for 2021, the team reinforced their interest in developing these anonymous tokens.      “Memory is an amazing thing,” said George Kadianakis, a Tor Network team developer. “It allows us to experience the world, remember the things we've been to and remember the nice food we ate.      “It's also particularly important in our digital life. At Tor, we don't have the concept of memory. The Tor network does not keep track of its clients, does not use cookies or anything, and every claim that comes in and comes out we forget about it. So Tor is memoryless. It's stateless. And this fact causes some issues.”      A DoS attack is one such issue.    What is a DoS attack?    A DoS attack disrupts a website by initiating thousands of connections to it, overwhelming it and causing it to crash.      Tor is particularly vulnerable to such attacks because of its emphasis on anonymity. While a normal network would have your identity tied to an account or the like, Tor does not; therefore, it doesn’t have a great way of differentiating malicious traffic from non-malicious traffic.      The process of navigating the Tor network to secure a connection between a server and remote user also requires intensive work by a central processing unit (CPU), which can get to a state where it’s maxed out and unable to accept new traffic, a feature DoS attacks exploit.      Read more: Tor Project Launches Membership Program to Boost Agility, Funds      “The attacks exploit the inherent asymmetric nature of the onion service rendezvous protocol, and that makes it a hard problem to defend against,” reads a post that examines solutions to DoS attacks..      “During the rendezvous protocol, an evil client can send a small message to the service while the service has to do lots of expensive work to react to it,"" the post reads. ""This asymmetry opens the protocol to DoS attacks, and the anonymous nature of our network makes it extremely challenging to filter the good clients from the bad.”    How anonymous tokens could help    Rather than implementing accounts or cookies, both of which would undermine Tor’s mission, Kadianakis proposed tokens that could be included in a user’s traffic request. These tokens would allow websites accessible through the Tor network to “intelligently prioritize which requests it answers.”      “We could use anonymous tokens. Tokens are a part of the internet that use blockchains and other protocols like Cloudflare’s Privacy Pass,” saids Kadianakis during the presentation. “It's basically like a train ticket. By having a train ticket you can show that you've done some effort to acquire it, but it doesn't tie to your identity. So if you drop it on the floor and someone else picks it up they cannot impersonate you and they don't know who you are.”      The scenario he envisioned is one where the onion service could issue these tokens and give them to clients who have already demonstrated their trustworthiness (in ways yet to be determined). These trusted clients would then give their tokens to the onion service when they connect and, in doing so, get service before an untrusted user (eg., a potential attacker).      Read more: ‘Digital Mercenaries’: Why Blockchain Analytics Firms Have Privacy Advocates Worried      Kadianakis said tokens could also be used to design a secure name system so people can register names for their own use with tickets, which could help encourage audience activities.      “The anonymous nature of our network makes it challenging to filter the good clients from the bad. There is no one established attacker, but rather an ongoing challenge,” according to Isabela Bagueros, executive director of the Tor Project.      “That is why we are focused on investigating methods to rate limit or otherwise reduce the ability of clients to make large numbers of connections to an onion service without violating a client or service's privacy,” she said.      Users could also apply their tokens toward acquiring private bridges and exit nodes, which would potentially provide additional security. Private bridges are how users access the Tor network in places where censors have blocked access to public Tor relays by blocking their IP addresses. They have a collection of private bridges that are not publicly available; these can be handed out a few at a time to clients in order to impede enumeration and IP address-blocking by censors.    Tokens may help with one crypto hack    Another attack vector for hackers are “relays.” Relays route traffic and obscure traceable and identifiable IP addresses, with an exit relay being the final one that connects users to a site.      As CoinDesk reported in August, a hacker was using his or her position as a “major exit relay host to stage sophisticated person-in-the-middle attacks, stripping websites of encryption and giving her/him full unrestricted access to traffic passing through her/his servers.” The hacker was using this access to steal cryptocurrencies.      When asked what impact tokens might have on mitigating such an attack, Bagueros said a token-based approach could improve usability in a way that makes phishing attacks like this infeasible, but it all depends on the integration.      Read More: Start9 Labs Pitches a Private At-Home Server. And It Works      “Another approach to this issue, one that we're already taking, is to strengthen the onion services ecosystem and encourage more service and sites to use onions, as onion services do not use exit nodes and therefore bypass this kind of attack completely,” she said in an email to CoinDesk.      For exits and exit safety, the Tor Project is investigating ways of creating a trusted set of exit relays with known and verified operators, to reduce the incidence of attack from exit usage, said Bagueros.      “We are also looking into requiring captcha-issued tokens in order to use these exits. In this way, these exits should be used less for automated scraping and spam, which should reduce the rate at which their IP addresses are banned from sites, and generally improve their IP address reputation,” she said.      The team is still researching tokens and does not have a timeline for development.    Proof-of-Work    Another approach the original blog post lays out is a proof-of-work system to acquire tokens.      Onion services can ask the client to solve a proof-of-work puzzle before they’re allowed to connect.      “With the right proof-of-work algorithm and puzzle difficulty, this can make it impossible for an attacker to overwhelm the service, while still making it reachable by normal clients with only a small delay,” read the post.      In the case of DDoS attacks, Kadianakis said Tor could employ proof-of-work tokens created by the clients themselves and sent directly to the service.      Read more: How a Hacker Launched a Decentralized Network to Track Internet Censorship      “Proof-of-work is one way to make it more expensive for clients to consume service resources in bulk that we're investigating,” said Bagueros. “We're also looking into ... a token that signifies the quantity of work spent compactly without impacting privacy.”      Tor has not yet found a privacy-oriented blockchain it sees as sufficient for this, but remains hopeful one will be found.      In terms of other ways of earning these tokens, Tor lays out a number of options, such as allowing connected sites to award tokens to trusted users or giving users tokens with every donation they make to the project. It is also in the midst of brainstorming what additional benefits tokens could offer, how they could interact with each other and what wallets for them might look like, including a Tor Browser wallet integration.

42385141,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnNdh,1605735203,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Hits $18.4K; $260M in Ether Options Expire in December,"Higher spot volumes Wednesday – and record volumes for the past month – are helping push bitcoin higher. Meanwhile, ether options for December pass 550,000 ETH.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $17,688 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 0.17% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $17,571-$18,474 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC below its 10-day moving average but above the 50-day, a sideways signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin made gains for the third straight day this week, going as high as $18,474 according to CoinDesk 20 data. The price slipped, however, to $17,688 as of press time.      Read More: Bitcoin Indicator Suggests Bull Market Is Still in Early Phase      The last time bitcoin was in this range occurred way back in December 2017. “In general, the market sentiment is still very bullish,” said Andrew Tu, an executive at quant firm Efficient Frontier. “It is possible that we range between $17,500 and $18,300 for a bit. However, it seems likely in the coming days that we break the $18,300 resistance.”      Constantin Kogan, managing director at Wave Financial, points to a $18,690-$18,950 “resistance” area where exchange books have a number of sell orders piled up, though he expects bitcoin to push above that soon. “I'm bullish, personally,” he told CoinDesk.      Volumes were much higher than normal Wednesday, with major spot USD/BTC over $1.6 billion as of press time, surpassing this past month’s Nov. 5 high.      “We've had a strong run up from $13,200, which was only a couple of weeks ago, and I think it's now gunning for the all time high,” noted Rupert Douglas, head of institutional sales for crypto brokerage Koine. However, Douglas’ outlook mirrors Sir Isaac Newton’s famous dictum that what goes up must come back down. “At some stage we're going to see a flush down to $13,000. The trend is up but it won't be without volatility,” said Douglas.      The bitcoin derivatives market, which was nascent in the last major bull run, continues to see open interest rise. Bitcoin options on major venues, for example, are at over $4 billion as of press time, the highest they have ever been and a sign some smart money is looking to hedge away any risks volatility may – or may not – bring.      “Today’s active options market – which was nonexistent back in 2017 – is keeping any meteoric rises in check,” said Micah Erstling, a trader at firm GSR.      Nevertheless, Erstling sees more money piling in because of crypto’s eye-popping performance so far in 2020. “Seasoned investors are finding it increasingly hard to argue with bitcoin’s performance – over 133% year-to-date, and up 100% over the last year.”    Ether options traders bet on 2.0    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was down Wednesday, trading around $472 and slipping 2% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Ethereum Classic Gets DeFi Treatment With Wrapped ETC      The amount of open ether options for December expiration has surpassed 550,000 ETH, worth more than $260 million as of press time.      Traders are likely taking bets about the future of Ethereum’s technical roadmap to “2.0”, an ambitious effort to insert staking and higher efficiency while porting over its native asset, ether.      “Our theory is that this open interest pattern in ETH was strictly due to traders positioning themselves for an ETH 2.0 phase 0 launch, or yet another delay,” said Greg Magadini, chief executive officer of options data aggregator Genesis Volatility. “Even while BTC options had open concentrated in different expiration months, ETH consistently had open interest concentrated in December.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed Wednesday, mostly red.

The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court in New Jersey, claims Forbes and two writers, Michael del Castillo and Jason Brett, harmed Binance by publishing a story that “contains numerous false, misleading and defamatory statements.”      In the suit, Binance denies a laundry list of allegations in the Forbes story and even refuted the veracity of the “Tai Chi” documents at its core. In the document, Binance demands that Forbes take down the article and pay punitive damages to be determined at trial.      The suit is the latest escalation of long-simmering tensions between Binance and the news media. Binance is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world and also one of the most closely scrutinized. Central questions swirl around it and its founder Changpeng Zhao, better known to the industry as CZ.      But while Binance has sued other firms for defamation in the past, it has shied away from doing the same to the media. Instead, Binance tends to fight stories in the court of public opinion, namely on social media.      “We exercise and support freedom, including freedom of information and freedom of the press, as well as accountability,” a Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk, adding:    “We want to assure the media that this suit doesn’t represent any threats to the reporting of Binance.

42385134,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnNW9,1605729740,"DeFi Exploits Can’t Be Pinned on Flash Loans, Industry Leaders Say","Nine months ago, in a Denver convention center, a booth sat empty.      Littered with token stickers, the table was supposed to hold the physical representatives of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol bZx. It remained empty, however, as the team struggled to make sense of the digital forces twisting their young project.      bZx, as they would come to find out, was 2020’s flash loan ""patient zero"".      New cases haven't stopped in the months since then. Take November: $2 million from Akropolis, then $3.3 million from Cheese Bank, followed by $6 million from Value Finance and finally $7 million from Origin Protocol.      Flash loans remain the common thread through all those recent attacks. These DeFi-native tools enable a savvy investor to take out unbacked loans and amass leverage behind a position. For example, Monday’s Origin Protocol attacker pulled a 70,000 ETH loan from decentralized derivatives platform dYdX. It enabled the attacker to up the amount of loot sucked out of the project.      Yet, while they may be the string connecting these exploits, flash loans are not the cause in and of themselves, industry leaders told CoinDesk.    Oracle manipulation and flash loans    It may not even be fair to characterize the recent DeFi exploits as “flash loan attacks,” Chainlink co-founder Sergery Nazarov told CoinDesk in an email.      Nazarov said flash loans at their core are just lump sums of capital thrown at success trade positions. The real issue lies with poorly constructed DeFi projects.      “While many are trying to frame this trend as the result of flash loans, most of these exploits could have been committed by any well-capitalized actor. All a flash loan does is temporarily make anyone a well-capitalized actor,” Nazarov said.      Read more: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About the DeFi 'Flash Loan' Attack      DeFi’s projects are smart contracts deployed to the Ethereum blockchain. They require outside information, namely pricing data, to execute actions baked into each contract.      That pricing information is liable to distortions simply because of how the Ethereum blockchain packages transactions – that is, every 15 seconds. Prices can move every which way in 15 seconds, which forces smart contracts to act on stale data.      Moreover, many DeFi applications rely on in-house pricing oracles created by token reserves, non-decentralized pricing feeds or other ad hoc solutions. For example, Harvest Finance leaned on another DeFi project, Curve Finance, to price its token pools.      In cases like Harvest Finance, interoperability became a negative dependency. A flash loan worth $50 million deviated asset prices temporarily away from the market value, creating an arbitrage opportunity. A project that had a more robust pricing system wouldn’t have fallen prey to the exploit, the theory goes.    Are audits enough?    Another point developers are coming to grips with is that code audits alone don’t make a DeFi project safe.      Speaking with CoinDesk via Whatsapp, Quantstamp CEO Richard Ma said developers need to understand markets themselves, perhaps more so than the code they deploy to the Ethereum blockchain. Quantstamp has audited or consulted on multiple top DeFi projects such as Curve Finance, MakerDAO and SushiSwap, among others.      “Understanding the products and the business logic is much more time-consuming and important than a straight-up code review,” Ma said.      Indeed, Akropolis was audited twice by two separate firms, but still suffered a re-entrancy attack.      This sort of attack occurs when a smart contract’s backdoor is left ajar. The contract’s state – which records how many tokens the contract has, among other things – fails to update quickly enough when tokens are removed, allowing the attacker to move more coins out than okay. It’s not dissimilar to a lazy bank teller continuing to fork over funds from an overdrawn account.      Read more: Harvest Finance: $24M Attack Triggers $570M 'Bank Run' in Latest DeFi Exploit      Combining audit redundancies with insurance is a step at least one major cryptocurrency investment firm is now urging.      “We are recommending our portfolio companies to get multiple audits from more than one provider,"" Paul Veradittakit, partner at venture capital firm Pantera, said in an email. ""We also think that projects and investors may want to buy insurance to protect themselves.""      It’s also notable that none of the top DeFi projects have suffered oracle attacks spurred by flash loans, dYdX founder Antonio Juliano told CoinDesk in a message. Many flash loans used in attacks have originated on his platform, which offers the product without a fee.      He said that “there’s a big divide between the well-engineered projects and others;” a divide being fleshed out in real time by flash loans.      “In the same way you wouldn’t blame Ethereum for an implementation detail of the chain being used for an attack, the way flash loans are being used in exploits is the fault of developers building insecure applications, not the flash loans themselves,” Juliano said.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | MARKET,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/18/defi-exploits-cant-be-pinned-on-flash-loans-industry-leaders-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/07789dafdb192832d563ef24ab91727f4486c3ad-1200x678.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385142,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnNcR,1605727460,Bitcoin’s Rally Could Be Caused by a Supply Crunch in China,"Bitcoin's price surge may be driven as much by a drying up in supply as by an increase in demand.      That’s because Chinese miners are struggling to sell their crypto in ways that would quickly get them much-needed cash in the face of a government crackdown on local exchanges.      “The lack of supply has fed extremely well to the trendiness of this rally, without any of the large sell-downs typical of miner activity in the past,"" Singapore-based trading firm QCP Capital noted in its Telegram channel.      QCP’s interpretation of the rally is simpler and less exciting than some of the other popular explanations, which cite macro factors such as demand for a hedge against monetary and fiscal indiscipline, an impending rise in inflation across the developed world, and search for yield as primary reasons for the price surge.      Miners mostly operate using cash and offload their bitcoin holdings onto the market almost daily to fund their expenses, mainly electricity costs, which are to be paid in the local currency (yuan, in the case of those operating in China). That makes miners constant sellers, and their actions influence the market price.      However, Chinese miners, who control over 70% of bitcoin’s hashrate or mining power, have been facing challenges liquidating their crypto holdings for cash because many are finding their bank accounts and cards frozen as a part of the Chinese government's nationwide crackdown on telecommunications fraud and money laundering via cryptocurrency deals.      QCP cited a blog by a Chinese crypto watcher going by the name Wu Blockchain, who found that 74% of the miners he polled are facing difficulty meeting electricity expenses. ""There are also miners who said that the mining machine has been shut down for a month because they cannot sell the currency to pay the electricity bill,"" Wu added, according to a Google translation of his blog. ""Some OTC companies that specialize in serving miners have also terminated their business.""      Thomas Heller, formerly global business director at the mining pool F2Pool and now chief operation officer of mining and media firm HASHR8, confirmed the Chinese miners' predicament earlier this week, saying it’s currently a “challenge” for Chinese miners to convert bitcoin and tether into cash.      Read more: China’s Crypto Miners Struggle to Pay Power Bills as Regulators Clamp Down on OTC Desks      The industry has been suffering ever since the Chinese authorities began freezing bank accounts in June and the situation has worsened in the past couple of months.      “Mining pools were selling large chunks of bitcoin in early September through exchanges, but this was hastily halted as their last remaining fiat off-ramp avenues were impacted with the arrest of large exchange heads like Star Xu and other [over-the-counter] brokers,” QCP Capital said.      Miner selling pushed bitcoin lower, roughly from $12,000 to $10,000, according to QCP Capital. The supply, however, dried up after the cryptocurrency exchange OKEx’s accounts were frozen in October.      That, coupled with increased institutional participation or large buying in the spot market, created a supply crunch, allowing an exaggerated bullish move.      Bitcoin is currently trading at $17,700, representing an over 140% year-to-date gain. Prices are short $2,500 of the record high of nearly $20,000 reached in December 2017.    Rally overstretched?    Sharp price gains are often accompanied by a big jump in the funding rate, the mechanism used by exchanges offering perpetuals (futures with no expiry) to balance the market and guide the perpetuals price toward the spot price.      The funding rate is positive, or longs pay shorts, when the perpetuals trade at a premium to the spot price, indicating stronger buying pressure. Alternatively, when perpetuals trade at a discount to the spot market, the funding rate is negative and shorts pay funding to longs.      A very high funding rate is widely considered a sign of an overextended bull run and often paves the way for a price pullback. For instance, the funding rate surged from 0.008% to 0.078% in the first half of August as bitcoin rallied to multi-month highs above $12,450. The cryptocurrency deflated to $9,800 by the second week of September.      This time, the funding rate has remained steady below 0.010%, meaning the cost of holding long positions is still considerably lower than in mid-August. Hence, a meaningful correction could continue to remain elusive, allowing further upside in the near term, possibly above record highs.      As per QCP Capital, the spot market imbalance driving the price has allowed the leverage funding market to remain stable throughout the recent bullish move.      UPDATE (Nov. 19, 16:25 UTC): Replaced QCP's summary of Wu Blockchain's blog post in seventh paragraph with direct quotes from the post.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/18/bitcoins-rally-could-be-caused-by-a-supply-crunch-in-china,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a07fb2ae1e05c0e31220d56c5ce30169df5e7616-1920x1309.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385127,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnNOb,1605723199,The Dark Future Where Payments Are Politicized and Bitcoin Wins,"Satoshi Nakamoto intended Bitcoin to be used for online payments. But it never caught on as a mainstream payments option.      The main hurdle to widespread adoption of bitcoin-as-cash is its wild, and potentially lucrative, price changes. This roller coaster problem isn’t going to disappear. Which means the only way for bitcoin payments to ever go mainstream is if the nation's reliable payment pipelines, the ones that have knitted it together for decades, stop doing their job. Only then will second- and third-best payments rails like bitcoin be called into play.    J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and was a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.    Here's a short story about how America's payments infrastructure slowly implodes and bitcoin payments go mainstream.      We all know that America is ideologically divided. This turmoil has already enveloped both the traditional media and social media, with many conservative voices now migrating to Parler while liberals stick to Twitter.      Banks and payments processors have also become venues for conflict. For instance, activists have successfully pressured card processors to cut off white supremacist book seller Counter-Currents, the Proud Boys' merchandise store and social network Gab, which describes itself as pro-free speech but has high concentrations of toxicity.      Imagine a world in which these divisions were to deepen. Say that some payment processors begin to cut off all customers who are deemed too Republican. In 2023, the Wall Street Journal is de-platformed by its acquirer, the bank that hooks it into the Visa and Mastercard networks. Companies with Trump-supporting executives like Home Depot and Goya Foods are cut off by their banks, too.      See also: JP Koning - The Standard About to Revolutionize Payments      Conversely, Republican activists start to pressure financial institutions to unplug Democrat-aligned businesses. In 2024, several large banks agree to stop connecting abortion clinics to the card networks.      What emerges by 2026 is a divided ecosystem of payments processors. One half specializes in connecting Republican businesses and nonprofits to core payments infrastructure, the other half specializes in connecting Democrat ones. Any bank or processor that tries to stay neutral is shunned – she who connects my enemy to Visa is my enemy.      Even at this level of divisiveness, Republicans and Democrats can still do business together. As long as Mastercard and Visa themselves remain neutral by letting both Republican- and Democrat-aligned payment processors hook into their networks, then dollars can flow across the ideological chasm.      But in 2029, Democrat activists pressure Visa to end its neutrality and disconnect all Republican payment processors. Suddenly, Republican businesses can no longer accept Visa cards. The next year Mastercard goes Republican. All Democrat-leaning businesses are exiled from the Mastercard network.      America is now divided into two card fiefdoms. Consumers will need one of each card if they want to shop at both Republican and Democrat stores. Democrat shoppers shamefully hide their Mastercards and Republicans their Visas, lest their friends and families see they are consorting with the enemy.      By 2031, cracks finally appear at the core of America's payments plumbing. The neutrality of the Federal Reserve, made up of 12 district Reserve banks, comes to an end. The CEO and directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, all staunch Republicans, unilaterally decide to stop providing Democrat-leaning banks in their district with access to Fedwire. The Kansas City district includes the states of Kansas, Wyoming, Nebraska, Colorado and Oklahoma.    No one wants to live in a country where bitcoin has become vital for payments.    Fedwire, the Federal Reserve's real-time settlement system, is America's most important payments utility. When anyone makes a payment from his or her bank to another bank, it'll eventually be settled by a movement of funds along Fedwire. By cutting off Democrat-leaning banks and their customers from this key utility, the Kansas City Fed effectively removes their access to the rest of the U.S. banking system.      The Atlanta Fed, also Republican, follows the Kansas City Fed a month later. In retaliation, the Federal Reserve banks of San Francisco and Boston disconnect Republican banks from Fedwire, in one swoop unbanking all Republican-leaning businesses located in their districts.      In 2033, the San Francisco Fed halts all incoming payments from both the Reserve banks of Kansas City and Atlanta. Suddenly, there is no such thing as a universal U.S. dollar. Money held in accounts in Georgia and Florida and Oklahoma can't move into accounts in California or Washington, and vice versa. The payment tissue that once connected all American has torn.      The collapse of America's payment infrastructure would be just one theater in a much larger factionalization of American society along ideological lines. Other key bits of American infrastructure would also begin to fall apart: the courts, law enforcement, the education system. There would be large physical dislocations as Republican families migrate to Republican enclaves and Democrats to Democrat enclaves.      But commercial life would still go on. Within their own enclaves, Democrats would still do business with Democrats, and Republicans with Republicans. They would probably rely on local credit-based systems to engage in trade. Credit, which relies on trust, is the most efficient way to carry out transactions.      See also: JP Koning - How Bitcoin Is Like Ham Radio      What about trade between Democrats in one enclave and Republicans in another enclave? Each side will produce goods that the other side needs. With neither side trusting the other, IOUs would be an unacceptable currency.      It’s possible that silver and gold would become popular again, as they were in the 1600s and 1700s. Or perhaps bitcoin would become America's favorite medium for conducting inter-factional trade. The nice thing about bitcoin, like gold, is that it doesn’t rely on a trusted counterparty. Suspicious traders needn't worry about the IOU-issuer welching.      But if America's electrical and telecommunications infrastructure has crumbled, would it even be possible for people to use bitcoin?      It’s a stretch, but we can imagine distributed solar power solving the electricity problem. As for accessing the bitcoin network, tinkerers could try to connect old-fashioned ham radios to Blockstream's bitcoin satellite. If the remnants of AT&T and Verizon can only provide patchy internet service, so-called decentralized mesh networks might offer an alternative way to access the web.      This dystopian future probably isn’t going to happen. For now, bitcoin has found a role as a popular way for Americans to speculate, sort of like gold. Let’s hope it stays that way.

42385139,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnNbB,1605720679,"Blockchain Bites: Bitcoin's Latest Billionaire Bull, Zcash's Upgrade, Grayscale's $10B Breakthrough","Bitcoin continues to rally, with one indicator suggesting the bulls have room to roam. Zcash, the privacy-minded blockchain network, had its first halving. And acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks may stay on for a five-year term.    Top shelf    Top or not? At least one obscure indicator suggests bitcoin’s bulls have room to roam. Already notching 80% gains in the past six weeks and fast approaching an all-time high of $20,000 set in 2017, the cryptocurrency’s Mayer Multiple – the ratio of price to the 200-day moving average – is showing the current rally may be in early stages. Standing at a 16-month high of 1.67, this indicator is still well short of the 2.4 threshold that has historically signaled the final leg of the bull markets. It was this key metric that preceded the end of the 2019, 2017 and 2013 bull runs. Things are different this time around, compared to three years ago there is less retail interest in bitcoin and significantly more institutional involvement.      New money Mariner Wealth Advisors, a registered investment advisory (RIA) with a network of financial planners managing some $29 billion, is the first to join a new bitcoin-focused separately managed account (SMA). This SMA will allow Mariner’s 346 wealth managers to offer bitcoin trading, custody and tax services for their 23,000 clients. Set up by crypto firm Eaglebrook Advisors, the SMA is targeting high-net-worth clients in the $5 million to $10 million range, offering many who did not participate in the 2017 bull run a chance to jump in. Eaglebrook is offering bitcoin custody services through Gemini Trust Company at launch. As of Tuesday, Mariner is Eaglebrook SMA’s only customer, though the company states it can easily scale to other RIAs.      $10 billion Grayscale Investments has broken above $10 billion in digital assets under management for the first time. The New York-based firm, wholly owned by CoinDesk’s parent company DCG, now oversees $10.4 billion in assets including bitcoin, ether and other altcoins held across nine single-asset investment trusts and a diversified fund. At last count on Oct. 30, Grayscale held $7.6 billion worth of crypto, meaning the latest milestone is largely due to price appreciation across the digital asset sector.      Halving an upgrade Zcash, a privacy-centered fork of Bitcoin, has completed its first halving, which not only cut miner rewards but triggered a network upgrade. At 12:37 UTC, the automatic event reduced the miner subsidy from 6.25 ZEC to 3.125 ZEC. It also triggered the Canopy upgrade, which established a new development fund and eliminated the controversial Founders Reward, in a move to more equitably fund network development. With the upgrade, miners will receive 80% of the block rewards, as before, with 20% divided among a grant fund, the Electric Coin Company (ECC) and the Zcash Foundation. Previously, critics said too much of the block reward was directed to the EEC.      Deep pockets Mexican billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego told the world that 10% of his liquid portfolio is now tied up in bitcoin. Tweeting Wednesday, he said, “Bitcoin protects the citizen from government expropriation.” Engaging with startled and ragingly bullish Bitcoiners, Salinas Pliego said the other 90% of his investments are “in precious metals miners,” recommended reading “El Patron Bitcoin” and dismissed government-issued fiat. The billionaire made his fortune as founder and chairman of Grupo Salinas, a collection of companies with stakes in telecommunications, media, financial services and retail.

(CoinDesk)  Market intel    Institutional interest Open interest for bitcoin futures traded on CME Group’s exchange hit a new high of $976 million Monday. ""The number of large open interest holders (LOIH) is once again at a record 102 holders,” a CME spokesperson told CoinDesk. The previous record of $948 million in outstanding CME derivative contracts was set in mid-August, following bitcoin-positive statements from respected financiers Paul Tudor Jones, Stanley Druckenmiller and Bill Miller. While open interest may be “indicative of institutional investors wanting exposure to bitcoin,"" according to Chainalysis Chief Economist Phillip Gradwell, it’s important to note that CME's recent surge comes as incumbent exchanges BitMEX and Huobi face ongoing regulatory challenges and flat or declining open interest through Q3 and Q4.    At stake    Banking head Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks may take on a full-term position. Yesterday, outgoing President Donald Trump nominated the former bank executive and chief legal officer for Coinbase to lead the national bank regulator for a five-year term.      Since taking office temporarily, Brooks has pushed forward a number of policy decisions seeking to clarify and ease national banks’ working relationship with the digital asset sector. Most notably, the OCC has published two letters telling nationally regulated banks they could offer crypto custody services and hold funds for fiat-backed stablecoin issuers.      While taken as a positive signal, the true effect of these statements has yet to fully play out. Kristen Smith, founder of the Blockchain Association, a Washington, D.C., crypto advocacy group, said in September, following the stablecoin guidance, that any practical changes will likely be muted.      That has not kept some government officials from criticizing Brooks' focus on cryptocurrency and fintech. Last week, a group of House Democrats published a sharply worded letter saying Brooks’ priorities have been misplaced during a severe economic downturn and public health crisis.      “Arguably, the immediate needs of millions of at-risk individuals who have not yet received an economic stimulus check and/or cannot deposit their funds in a bank, deserve greater attention than an effort to increase access to financial services to the ‘banked community’ via mobile phones,” they wrote.      CoinDesk regulatory reporter Nikhilesh De writes that Brook faces several hurdles to confirmation. The U.S. Senate Banking Committee oversees the OCC, and will likely hold a confirmation hearing before the entire Senate votes to confirm or reject Brooks’ nomination.

42385146,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnNex,1605720307,"First Mover: As Bitcoin Shoots Past $18K, There's Comfort in the Crowded Trade","Bitcoin's ascent continues, with prices scaling the $18,000 mark during Asian trading hours. In a sign of persistent dip demand, sudden pullback to $17,200 seen following the breakout to fresh 34-month highs was quickly reversed.      ""Bitcoin will now be setting its sights on the all-time high of $20,000,"" Simon Peters, crypto asset analyst at multi-asset investment platform eToro, said in an email. ""The last time bitcoin hit the $20,000 mark was in 2017 and retail investors piled in as they experienced crypto FOMO.""      In traditional markets, European shares and U.S. stock futures gained ground, and safe havens such as gold and the dollar weakened as investors continued to price in prospects of swift global recovery on potential coronavirus vaccines.    Market moves    Has betting on bitcoin become a crowded trade?      That was the assessment of some 4% of global fund managers in a monthly survey published Tuesday by Bank of America, when asked to name the ""most crowded trade."" The response ""long bitcoin"" ranked behind ""long U.S. tech"" (65%), ""short U.S. banks"" (11%), ""long corporate bonds"" (9%) and ""long gold"" (5%):      A few things come to mind.      1) It's hard to argue that ""long bitcoin"" is particularly crowded right now, given how many big investors have yet to assert that the trade has any merit at all. On Tuesday, Ray Dalio, CEO of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, tweeted several ""problems with bitcoin being an effective currency,"" including its limited usability as a form of payment. ""What am I missing?"" Dalio wrote. (#CryptoTwitter had plenty of responses for that.)      According Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign exchange and cryptocurrency research firm Quantum Economics, price-chart patterns suggest that bitcoin was ""due for a pullback a long time ago.""      ""But the fundamentals are firmly in control right now as increasingly large players are entering this tiny market,"" Greenspan wrote Tuesday.      In other words, people are just starting to arrive.      2) If the trade is crowded, then a lot of investors must be overjoyed at how well it's working out this year. Bitcoin shot past $17,000 Tuesday, and then $18,000 early Wednesday, rising to levels not seen in three years and with prices up more than 150% year to date. That compares with 12% for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks. This might be a sign the rally is overdone. But as discussed previously by First Mover, a lot of investment decisions are made on the basis of backward-looking track records. Few big banks have made a serious push into cryptocurrencies, but Germany's Deutsche Bank has described bitcoin as the world's best-performing asset in 2021.      ""If you knew 10,000 people who owned bitcoin, you could phone all of them and congratulate them on their success,"" Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the cryptocurrency firm Diginex, wrote Tuesday. ""Thing is, you don't know 10,000 people who own bitcoin, you probably only know a handful. And they will all say the same thing: 'I don't own enough.'""      3) Market signals suggest that interest among big investors is growing, not plateauing – indicating there's no shortage of traders looking to put more money into the trade. Open interest in bitcoin futures has climbed to above $6 billion from $4 billion as recently as October, according to the data firm Skew. Even those amounts are still tiny fractions of bitcoin's total market capitalization, currently about $325 billion.      4) The number of active bitcoin addresses recently climbed to about 1.2 million, but that's still a touch below levels witnessed during bitcoin's bull run of 2017, when prices surged to an all-time high near $20,000. According to the Norwegian cryptocurrency analysis firm Arcane Research, ""the number of active addresses has grown more organically in 2020, without a surging and dramatic spike as witnessed in late 2017.""      ""The increase in active addresses indicate that bitcoin is seeing increased usage and adoption,"" Arcane wrote Tuesday in a report. ""This is a bullish and healthy sign and underlines the strength of the current bull run.""      5) The reality is that nobody really knows how to value bitcoin. It's an 11-year-old cryptocurrency, too short of a timeline to really evaluate what it might be worth in the future, especially when neither Federal Reserve nor private economists can agree on the likelihood of eventual runaway inflation from this year's trillions of dollars of coronavirus-related stimulus, or on the impact of epochal changes like the shift to remote working. Bitcoin has no earnings, so it can't be valued like a stock, and it has no yield, so it can't be valued like a bond. The price is really just a function of how many people want to buy it, versus the amount that's created every day by cryptocurrency miners. (By the way, that's about 900 bitcoin per day, worth about $15.3 million at current prices.) Dalio argues that governments will ""outlaw it and make it too dangerous to use"" if bitcoin becomes too popular. But according to that same Bank of America fund-manager survey, some 3%-4% of global fund managers think bitcoin is the asset class most likely to outperform in 2021. (Emerging markets ranked first, followed by the S&P 500, oil and gold.)      So roughly the same percentage of respondents see bitcoin prices climbing higher as those who see the trade as overcrowded. These are all just guesses about what the future holds, of course. A Citigroup analyst recently predicted the price could pass $300,000 by the end of next year.      If that's the case, there's little reason for the crowd to disperse.    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin's recent rally from $10,000 to $18,000 looks similar to the steep rise to record highs near $20,000 seen in the final quarter of 2017. However, that does not necessarily mean the market is now nearing a top.      While the 2017 rally peaked in December, the current rally looks to have legs, according to the Mayer Multiple, which is the ratio of price to the 200-day moving average. At press time, the ratio stands at a 16-month high of 1.67. However, the metric is still well short of the 2.4 threshold that has historically signaled the final leg of the bull markets.      The ratio rose above 2.4 on Dec. 1, 2017, after which bitcoin doubled in value to $20,000 in just two weeks before falling back to $12,000 on Dec. 22. Similar price action was observed in April and November 2013 after the ratio rose above 2.4.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Bitcoin Indicator Suggests Bull Market Is Still in Early Phase    What's hot    CME sees record high open interest for bitcoin futures on wave of institutional inflows (CoinDesk)      Grayscale (a unit of CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group) says assets under management broke $10B (CoinDesk)      One of Mexico’s billionaires reveals 10% of his liquid assets are in bitcoin (CoinDesk)      Crypto-friendly U.S. regulator Brooks gets nod from Trump to serve 5-year term leading OCC (CoinDesk)      Traders brace for major volatility as bitcoin price nears record high (CoinDesk)      Zcash undergoes first halving as major upgrade drops ‘Founders Fund’ (CoinDesk)      OKEx mining pool flatlines after 99.5% hash power drop as withdrawal suspensions spook clients (CoinDesk)    Analogs  The latest on the economy and traditional finance    U.S. retail sales lose speed as pandemic, lack of fiscal stimulus weigh (Reuters)      Saudi Arabia's state oil company, Saudi Aramco, selling $8B of bonds to raise cash as low crude prices dent finances (Reuters)      Trump Federal Reserve nominee Judy Shelton (who advocated returning to gold standard) fails key Senate procedural vote (CNBC)      New York tourisim industry, which supported 400,000 jobs and $46B of annual spending in local hospitality industry, won't recover until 2025 (NYT)      Roughly 300 companies that received about $500M of emergency loans from the U.S. government have filed for bankruptcy (WSJ)    Tweet of the day",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole, Sebastian Sinclair",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/18/first-mover-as-bitcoin-shoots-past-18k-theres-comfort-in-the-crowded-trade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4343a67c85660d4c5eabce80111f492099196bf-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The collabo with the team behind CryptoKitties and now NBA Top Shot is seen by Genies as a way to introduce Gen Z-ers to the blockchain.      “Dapper Labs was a brain-dead fit for us to be able to further educate our young users,” Genies founder Akash Nigam told CoinDesk in an interview.      Genies has established itself as an avatar company bringing celebs closer to their fan bases, one digital representation at a time. With the pandemic, Nigam said there are now more incentives for influencers to interact virtually with their fans. Think of it as a way to make up for all those cancelled concerts, sporting events and meetups.      Last week, for instance, singer Justin Bieber announced his Christmas album on Twitter through his Genie.      Nigam said once Genies are up and running on Flow – the new blockchain built by Dapper Labs to flee the scaling constraints of Ethereum – Bieber could, for example, issue a certain number of signed Santa hats with his Christmas album announcement. The non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are digitally unique and can be sold and traded among users.      “Justin Bieber already sells vintage collectibles to his fans,” Nigam said. “We’re just extrapolating what they already do in the physical world and bringing it to the digital world.”      Read more: Dapper Labs–USDC Integration Helps NBA Collectibles Game Clear $2M in Revenue Since June      Roham Gharegozlou, CEO of Dapper Labs, added that users do not need to know the specifics of blockchain technology to understand true ownership.      “If something is on the blockchain, you own it and you can sell it.

42433149,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3QRh,1605715356,"FATF Needs Entirely New Approach to Regulating Crypto, Says V20 Summit","The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) needs an entirely new approach when it comes to policing crypto, according to Sian Jones, the driving force behind much of the sector’s anti-money laundering (AML) standards work to date.      Speaking at the close of the second annual V20 Virtual Asset Service Providers Summit, Jones said FATF only needs to look at the fast-evolving world of decentralized finance (DeFi) to see how incongruous the traditional system of checking transactions created half a century ago by SWIFT is becoming.      Global AML watchdog FATF has recommended local regulators of the G-20 countries and beyond try to graft the so-called Travel Rule requirements onto digital assets, where intermediaries (virtual asset service providers, or VASPs, in this case) must share personally identifiable information (PII) about crypto transactions.      Read more: Why FinCEN Wants Details on All Cross-Border Transactions Over $250      The core of crypto is about removing intermediaries, however – something DeFi clearly demonstrates, said Jones.      “FATF must consider developing entirely new approaches to manage money laundering and terrorist financing risks in crypto,” Jones told the V20 delegates Wednesday. “The tried and tested methods work, after a fashion, in the traditional world of money. Arguably, they can be made to sort of fit the intermediated crypto world. They do not necessarily fit a DeFi world where they are not fit for purpose.”      Jones added that FATF seems to have only partially grasped the fact that “crypto was born out of a desire by some, not to circumvent authority, break the law or facilitate money laundering, but rather to remove intermediaries, to disintermediate traditional finance.”    Members only    Day two of the V20 summit, which was open to members only, heard from several representatives from prominent DeFi platforms who told delegates they had either been refused access to FATF’s private-sector consultative forum meetings or haven’t heard at all from FATF, Jones said.      “The FATF’s Standards for virtual asset service providers are the product of extensive consultation between governments, industry and virtual asset experts. Since their finalisation last year, we have seen progress by both governments and industry. Well over half of FATF’s members have reported that they have now implemented the necessary changes into law,” a FATF spokesperson told CoinDesk via email.      “The virtual asset sector is incredibly fast-moving and diverse. This is why the FATF is closely monitoring the sector to see the impact of the Standards and identify new and emerging risks and trends,"" they continued. ""The FATF is releasing updated guidance on issues such as peer-to-peer transactions and unhosted wallets and will conduct a second review of the revised Standards by June 2021. As we have done throughout 2020, this will include consultation with a range of representatives from the virtual asset sector.""      “FATF needs to double down on its engagement with all actors, including DeFi software developers and users who are not part of the industrialized crypto world,” Jones said. “Equally, the industry needs to work more closely together to present a unified voice and its engagement with the FATF and regulators.”      Going forward, Jones recommended creating a single unit to speak to FATF representing all the industry and its associations, rather than 20 or so different voices each speaking for a few minutes. She also suggested meetings to talk to FATF occur more frequently – monthly instead of quarterly.      With many crypto Travel Rule solutions now live, including a widely adopted messaging standard, industry players dived into the nuts and bolts of getting those solutions to seamlessly interoperate.      Read more: Crypto Firms Establish Messaging Standard to Deal With FATF Travel Rule      The plethora of Travel Rule solutions has created an interoperability problem of its own, especially given the variety of proprietary proposals and non-profit protocols; some solutions prefer centralized anchor points like certificate authorities, while others want a more decentralized approach using blockchains and smart contracts.      Thus far, the biggest step in terms of interoperability has been the InterVASP Messaging Standard (IVMS 101), which details exactly the format the message payload of PII data sent between VASPs should take. Following on from this achievement, the V20 summit heard that several more standards have been tabled and are under discussion.    FATF friction    Malcolm Wright, head of AML at Global Digital Finance, highlighted areas where standards could help remove pain points – including directory sharing and customer data storage.      “Some solutions are working on a VASP directory or look-up and so we need to smooth out how a Sygna Bridge will talk to a Notabene,” said Wright. “Another could be a security standard for what happens to data when that is stored, like how that is secured and kept separate. We also mustn’t overlook the need to screen info for sanctions, although that’s probably not going to need a standard.”      Read more: Where FATF Crypto Compliance Gets Interesting: Africa      Leaving aside the wrinkle smoothing being done across FATF’s VASP universe – which is fairly limited to the so-called “industrialized crypto” space – the elephant in the room remains what happens with private or non-hosted wallets.      This is often seen by regulators as some kind of proxy for illicit activity but as previously stated it’s a core tenet of crypto, not to mention a necessary way to avoid regularly recurring exchange hacks.      “Over the next few years there are a whole set of issues around non-custodial private wallets which are just massive,” said CipherTrace CEO Dave Jevans. “That would make all the work we’ve done over the past 18 months seem like child’s play.”      EDIT (15:13 UTC, Nov. 19 2020): Updated with comment from FATF.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/11/18/fatf-needs-entirely-new-approach-to-regulating-crypto-says-v20-summit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5a13ee2eeabed90703b7822b3724e12467acf0a9-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433154,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3QVh,1605713186,What the History of Airlines Tells Us About Blockchain Commerce,"We may be nearly 30 years into the internet era but nearly every asset, product and service in the global economy remains an offline asset. From cars to farm tractors to apartments to storage spaces, the truth is the vast majority of the world’s productive economic assets are offline. We don’t know if they’re busy or not, if they need maintenance or if they’re available to be rented. We can’t even find our car keys.      That’s going to end soon. In the coming years, a combination of blockchain, wireless networks and internet of things (IoT) is going to start connecting, digitizing and tracking the world’s stock of productive assets. Every piece of capacity can be represented as a digital token on a blockchain, accessible through smart contracts, and managed and available based on IoT-enabled connectivity. The impact is going to be enormous; some industries are going to be turned upside down overnight, while others might not change much at all. How will we be able to know and predict what will be impacted and how? I suggest a brief study of history.    Paul Brody is EY's global innovation leader for blockchain. The views in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the global EY organization or its member firms.    While the possibility of true digitization has been around for about 30 years, we still have a long way to go. One case study worth considering is the airline industry, which was one of the very first to be fully digitized and has had, to put it mildly, a very rough ride along the way.      In the fall of 2005, I remember landing at San Francisco International Airport on a flight from Dallas. Over the PA, the flight attendant thanked us, as usual, for choosing her airline. She concluded her message with a line that made the whole plane laugh: “We know you had a choice of bankrupt airlines for your flight today and we thank you for choosing us.” At the time, nearly every major U.S. airline was under the protection of Chapter 11 bankruptcy. For some of them, it was their second visit in less than a decade.      While the immediate cause of this particular wave of bankruptcies was a combination of the dot-com collapse and the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the financial situation of the major airlines had been dire for a long time. Since airlines were deregulated in 1979 there has been a steady stream of bankruptcies and mergers as the industry consolidates. This isn’t a story about deregulation, however; it’s a story about digitization.      The airline industry offers a unique and interesting real-world experiment in what happens when you digitize an industry. What makes this industry particularly interesting is that it’s possible to look at the impact of digitization as having effectively taken place from one moment to the next. This is because although digitization of the airline industry took more than a decade, regulations that governed where airlines could fly and how much they could charge meant that no real impact on pricing or economics could be seen while the industry was regulated.    Every piece of capacity can be represented as a digital token on a blockchain, accessible through smart contracts, and managed and available based on IoT-enabled connectivity.    Starting in the 1960s with American Airlines, airlines began a process of converting their reservations systems to fully digital, online systems. By the 1970s, every seat on every flight in the U.S. was part of a continuously available digital market. Travel agents (and eventually consumers) could search the entire national inventory of flights and seats, compare prices and issue tickets entirely online. Though it wasn’t until the 1990s that electronic tickets were implemented, the reservation and purchasing process was nearly completely digital end to end by the mid-1970s.      During this period of digitization, the industry economics remained largely unchanged, thanks to the regulatory environment. Prior to 1979, the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) regulated airlines, determining where they could fly and how much they could charge. The CAB also guaranteed a reasonable rate of return, provided there was sufficient passenger demand and limited competition between carriers. The result was an orderly national growth of air travel and a proliferation of different airlines, many of them profitable.      From the end of 1978, the Airline Deregulation Act rapidly phased out most price and route restrictions, and suddenly we had a free and open marketplace in which all the capacity was visible. The result was a bloodbath. Between 1981 and 2000, more than 30 major U.S. airlines declared bankruptcy and most of them never returned. Famous names from the earliest days of aviation disappeared, including Pan Am and TWA. Many of the others merged with the stronger survivors – ""strong"" being a relative term because nearly all of the industry’s “winners” spent a stint in bankruptcy as well.      See also: Paul Brody - Enterprises Need Third Parties for Oracles to Work      The economics of air travel are challenging for a couple of reasons. First and foremost, the marginal cost of flying an additional passenger on a plane is nearly zero. Selling that ticket for as little as a few dollars is better than leaving the seat empty. And because seats cannot be filled after take-off, there is always a “final sale” going on. This often leads to airlines selling seats that are at the margin, profitable, but are on average far below costs.      Perhaps most painfully for airlines, and despite decades of work on everything from service quality to scheduling analytics it turns out most consumers buy their plane tickets based on only one major criteria: price. And though at times it may seem like the entire world is addicted to frequent flyer miles, they turn out not to be a strong enough lure to sustain substantially better pricing over a long period of time.      The result: Prices trended towards marginal cost of flying one more passenger (which is nearly zero) and far below the actual average cost whenever the industry has excess capacity. The industry has historically been good at creating excess capacity by both ordering more planes and getting much more efficient at flying those planes. Nor is parking the plane an option, not when they cost up to $100 million each and are purchased with borrowed money.      Finally, and this is where digitization is so powerful, the structural elements of the ecosystem (high fixed costs, low marginal costs) are amplified by the digital marketplace. Every seat on every flight is instantly visible, making comparison-shopping and capacity-planning very easy. That leaves no quiet, profitable corners of the market hidden from view.      And now as digital rolls forward, there might be many more similar industry experiences in multiple industries. IoT is going to instrument a lot of industrial capacity, much of which is presently both idle and invisible. Just like the airline industry, once a huge amount of idle capacity becomes visible and bookable online, the likely effect is a plunge in pricing. How many idle MRI machines or pieces of mobile, heavy construction equipment are out there?      Which products and industries are most at risk? Not every product is easily subdivided or shared, but those with capacity that can be shared are at higher risk than others. Industries that have low asset utilization are also at risk. Even before COVID-19, most offices sat idle much of the time. Movie theaters are empty during the week. Classrooms are quiet three months of the year. What if all these facilities and assets could be managed, booked and utilized online?    We’ve learned the hard way in the last few months that we probably pay for much more office space than we really need. What’s next?    Many people are rightly skeptical about how transformational this technology might be – does anyone really want to use a theater during the day? How about a classroom on the weekend? But again, there are some interesting lessons from the airline industry. In the U.S., the CAB promised airlines they would receive a 12% return on invested capital for routes that operated with at least 55% capacity utilization. Airlines often assumed that mid-week flights would run nearly empty and holiday destinations would have weak performance in the off-season.      In the decades after deregulation, airlines discovered they could fill mid-week flights and off-peak destinations to the brim if the price was right. In 2018, the average U.S. airline had a load factor of 83%. That means, as many have experienced, full planes, seven days a week, 365 days a year. With the proper incentives, we should not be surprised if, a couple of decades from now, new movie theaters or classrooms are easily reconfigured into offices or meeting spaces, and MRI services are open 24 hours a day.      Can enterprises prepare themselves for this future of digital disruption? They can start by getting a much deeper understanding of their assets, which ones are essential, how much they are really being utilized and how necessary they are for operations. We’ve learned the hard way in the last few months that we probably pay for much more office space than we really need.

42433166,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3Qnh,1605708012,Ethereum Classic Gets DeFi Treatment With Wrapped ETC,"Ethereum Classic wants to play in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space of the blockchain from which it contentiously split in 2016.      Announced Wednesday, Ethereum Classic Labs, the ETC blockchain’s biggest supporter, released Wrapped ETC (WETC) – an ERC-20 token that lets ETC holders participate in Ethereum-based DeFi services like trading, lending and borrowing.      “We wanted to make sure ETC could go to a different ecosystem and use different applications on top of that ecosystem,” said James Wo, founder and chairman of ETC Labs. “I expect at least 10% of ETC holders will want to participate and use WETC.”      Wrapping is the act of taking a blockchain asset like bitcoin and issuing an equivalent representation on another blockchain such as Ethereum. Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), for instance, is an ERC-20 token that’s backed on a 1:1 basis with bitcoin held in reserve by qualified custodian BitGo Trust. More recently, Zcash announced a wrapped, DeFi-ready version of the privacy coin.      Read more: Privacy Coin Zcash Makes Its Ethereum ‘Wrapped’ Debut With Tokensoft and Anchorage      Wo of ETC Labs pointed out that WBTC tokens are backed and guaranteed by BitGo, a centralized entity. “What we have done here is use a smart contract so people can easily exchange ETC for WETC using a smart contract which is totally decentralized,” he said.      This is similarly the case for tBTC from Thesis and renBTC from Ren.      WETC can be transferred or stored in any ERC-20-compatible wallet or storage mechanism, said Wo. Under the hood, ChainBridge, a decentralized application that interfaces with both the Ethereum Classic blockchain and the Ethereum mainnet, allows ETC tokens to be transferred to the Ethereum mainnet via the bridge. Then a specified amount of ETC is locked in a smart contract and a corresponding amount of WETC is minted on Ethereum.      The release of WETC follows the launch of a DAI-ETC bridge, said Wo, which enables ETC users to gain access to MakerDAO's dai, a popular stablecoin in DeFi.    New beginnings    Ethereum Classic has something of a checkered history, beginning with its emergence in July 2016 from the Ethereum fork that followed the infamous DAO hack.      ETC, which trades at about $5 today, reached an all time high of $47 back in December 2017, thanks in no small part to the enthusiastic support from crypto investor Barry Silbert, CEO of Digital Currency Group, which is also the owner of CoinDesk. For context, Ethereum’s native asset, ether (ETH), is now trading at nearly $500.      The ETC blockchain was subjected to a series of 51% attacks in August. Wo agreed the emergence of WETC will help rebuild ETC’s reputation.      “I will say that right now ETC network is very secure, so you can trust it,” he said. “We are also directly building applications on top of the ETC network, as well as using WETC to go through the Ethereum network.”      Read more: Ethereum Classic Labs Airs New Plan to Stop Future 51% Attacks      In any case, Wo sees a bright future as ETC sticks to its proof-of-work (PoW) mining guns while Ethereum embarks on the difficult and extended jump to proof-of-stake (PoS).      “Not everyone trusts PoS. Some projects believe in PoW,” said Wo. “So I think some of the ecosystem will probably stick to ETC or other PoW versions of a blockchain that can do smart contracts.”      Correction (Nov. 18, 15:14 UTC): Technically, Ethereum ""forked"" from what became Ethereum Classic.

Paradigm co-founder and managing partner Fred Ehrsam has joined Fireblocks’ board of directors as part of the deal.      “One can say he almost built this space,” Fireblocks CEO Michael Shaulov said in an interview, referring to Ehrsam’s background as a co-founder of Coinbase.

Fireblocks provides tools for the secure storage and transfer of digital assets – be it for crypto exchanges or traditional hedge funds.      While Fireblocks plans to maintain its standing as “the biggest player in crypto-native markets,” Shaulov said, the firm also wants to go after institutional players given the positive regulatory momentum seen this past year.      “Everyone from crypto-native funds to large tech companies and banks are integrating Fireblocks because it's simple,” Ehrsam said in an email. “We’re excited to help them cement this market leadership position and support the influx in customer demand as crypto goes mainstream.”      Read more: Digital Bank Revolut Taps Fireblocks to Support New Crypto-Based Services      Fireblocks saw a 533% increase in customer growth in Q3, according to Shaulov.

Launched in October 2018, OKEx's pool used to rank as one of the tenth largest in the world, according BTC.com. After losing contact with an executive and being forced to suspend withdrawals, the firm's mining clients appear to have jumped ship, causing the OKEx to lose nearly all of its hash power.      OKEx previously controlled roughly 9,000 petahashes per second (PH/s) of SHA-256 mining power, according to reporting by The Block. Just before suspending withdrawals on Oct. 15, pool capacity was roughly 5,000 PH/s. Now that number has fallen to 20.8 PH/s.      OKEx did not respond to numerous attempts for comment by CoinDesk regarding the collapse of its mining pool. The firm also did not respond to requests asking how the mining pool team plans to revive its collapsed hash power.      Read more: Crypto Long & Short: The OKEx Drama Exposes a Weakness in Crypto Market Infrastructure      While payouts to mining clients aren’t directly affected by OKEx’s continued suspension of withdrawals from trading accounts, even the possibility of disbursement complications is sufficient reason for miners to switch pools, said Ethan Vera, co-founder of Seattle-based mining company Luxor Technology.      “Pool payouts are the lifeline of mining operations that don’t have large treasuries,” said Vera. “It’s no surprise that even the threat of that being cut off is enough for miners to jump ship to other mining pools.”      Most of OKEx’s pool activity occurred in the past 12 months, averaging 213 blocks mined per month during that period. But, using barely 20 PH/s, Vera estimates the pool is now expected to mine only one new block every 40 days.

42433147,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3QNh,1605704417,Vietnam’s Ministry of Education Adopts Blockchain Record-Keeping,"Vietnam’s Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) has entered into an exclusive agreement with Singapore-based smart contract platform TomoChain to archive student records on a blockchain, TomoChain announced Wednesday.      According to the announcement, the National Qualifications Archive program will upload all certifications achieved by Vietnam’s high school and higher education students to the TomoChain public blockchain to create a transparent and immutable record. Qualifications are currently managed by educational and training institutions, resulting in delayed verification processes by recruitment agencies and human resources, the statement said.      Record-keeping and identity verification are applications of blockchain technology that could be applied to public administration. Earlier this year, U.S. lawmakers called on President Trump’s administration to consider using blockchain technology to upgrade health care and supply registries, and to use the technology to speed up verifying identities of individuals due to receive government benefits.      “Diploma and certificate management is an issue that needs to be resolved by technology, which is significant for the whole of society and also cost-efficient for the diploma management system in particular, and education in general,” Vietnam’s Deputy Minister of Education and Training Nguyen Van Phuc said in a press statement.      The archive initiative is Vietnam's largest exploration of blockchain technology to date and marks the first instance of a public blockchain being adopted at the national level by a major government, the announcement said.      A number of countries and educational institutions have tested blockchain-based registries to keep student records. In 2017, Malta’s Ministry of Education struck a deal with a blockchain startup to track student credentials and academic records on a blockchain. The same year, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) issued 100 diplomas on a blockchain as part of a pilot program.    See also: Sony, Fujitsu Aim to Make Educational Data ‘Unfalsifiable’ With Blockchain    Headquartered in Singapore, TomoChain has additional offices in Vietnam and Japan. It has its own crypto exchange, TomoDEX, powered by a layer-one protocol TomoX, which launched earlier this year.      In September 2020, TomoChain acquired Lition, a German firm that provides public and private blockchain solutions with deletable data features.      After a trial in Vietnam, up to 1.5 million diplomas of all types granted by educational institutions under the MOET will be entered into the system. The nationwide system is set to be implemented for the 2020-2021 school year, TomoChain said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/18/vietnams-ministry-of-education-adopts-blockchain-record-keeping,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/40b931691c890916ad832c1c2d6a903a8c7d7383-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433145,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO3QLh,1605703044,Zcash Undergoes First Halving as Major Upgrade Drops 'Founders Reward',"Four years after forking from Bitcoin, privacy-centric blockchain network Zcash has completed its first halving and rolled out a major upgrade that does away with the unpopular ""Founders Reward.""      At 12:37 UTC, Zcash passed block height 1,046,400 to trigger the event that cuts miners' rewards from 6.25 ZEC to 3.125 ZEC.      A miner reward reduction or ""halving"" event occurs when the block subsidy, generated from new coins mined, is divided by two. The coded-in event usually triggers every four years at particular block heights depending on the particular chain.      Bitcoin had its third anti-inflationary halving back in March, and generally sees an increase after each subsequent halving event as supply is reduced.      Zcash began its journey as a fork from the Bitcoin blockchain on Oct. 28, 2016. It takes a focus on providing better privacy for users through zero-knowledge cryptography dubbed zk-SNARKs and is developed by the Electric Coin Company (ECC).      Such privacy features have been a money laundering concern for some regulators and policymakers. Earlier this month, Colorado-based cryptocurrency exchange Shapeshift delisted ZEC along with Monero (XMR) and Dash (DASH) – two other projects with added privacy – citing increased regulatory pressure.      It's not an issue for all trading platforms, though: Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange regulated in New York, started allowing users to withdraw zcash with its anonymizing feature on in September.      ""Zcash is the Bitcoin of privacy,"" said Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Hong Kong-based blockchain investment and trading firm Kenetic. ""The halving is not only a milestone event but an opportunity for traders to claw back some of the market share volume from privacy challengers like Monero.""      Like Bitcoin, Zcash's total supply has a hard cap of 21 million coins, a supply limit that is the polar opposite of the recent and unprecedented money printing by the world's central banks, and is attracting investor interest as a result.      ""Fixed supply cryptocurrencies like zcash and bitcoin aren’t interesting because their issuance rate halves every four years,"" said Ryan Watkins, research analyst at Messari. ""They’re interesting because their issuance schedule is predictable and deterministic.""    Goodbye, Founders Reward    ""What is likely far more interesting for Zcash is the activation of Canopy, its fifth network upgrade,"" said Watkins. ""The headline of this upgrade is the end of its Founders Reward and the beginning of its new development fund.""      On Jan. 3, 2019, a community forum member known as mineZcash initiated a year-long discussion that has now resulted in a trademark agreement and increased decentralization for Zcash within an all-new governance model that includes built-in funding for development.      Previously, Zcash's unpopular Founders Reward meant miners typically received 80% plus transaction fees for mining blocks. The remaining 20% of the reward was split among various parties including 9.85% to ECC founders, 2.2% to the Zcash Foundation, 5.75% to ECC itself and 2.2% to ECC employee compensation. This ended with the introduction of Canopy.      Following the upgrade, miners will continue to receive 80% of the block rewards, but the remaining 20% will be divided among the new Major Grants Fund (8%), ECC (7%) and the Zcash Foundation (5%).      The Major Grants Fund will support development via ""large-scale long-term projects (administered by the Zcash Foundation, with extra community input and scrutiny),"" according to the Zcash proposal.      See also: Spiritual Reflections on the Bitcoin Halving      Watkins noted that market participants were made aware ""months ago"" of Zcash's halving and coinciding network upgrade, so it's hard to see those events driving future value increases to the ZEC cryptocurrency.      ""Perhaps the halving at best may raise awareness of zcash, because of the publicity halvings usually get, but who knows.""      At time of writing, ZEC was trading at about $63, down 3% over 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.      Correction (Nov. 18, 14:18 UTC): Corrected error in headline that called the ""Founders Fund"" a ""Founders Reward.""",POSITIVE,ZEC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TRADING | ZEC,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/18/zcash-undergoes-first-halving-as-major-upgrade-drops-founders-reward,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a6f593ee8b25376d36c457fa8e1654e061626448-1500x840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With prices rising by 80% to levels above $18,000 in the past six weeks, the cryptocurrency's Mayer Multiple – the ratio of price to the 200-day moving average – has risen to a 16-month high of 1.67. However, the metric is still well short of the 2.4 threshold that has historically signaled the final leg of the bull markets.      The Mayer Multiple flashed similar values around bitcoin's second mining reward halving in July 2016. Back then, bitcoin was trading at $650 and went on to hit highs near $20,000 in December 2017.      The ratio rose above 2.4 on Dec. 1, 2017, following which bitcoin doubled in value to $20,000 in just two weeks before falling back to $12,000 on Dec. 22. Similar price action was observed in April and November 2013 after the ratio rose above 2.4. Bitcoin also topped out at $13,880 at the end of June 2019 with the ratio rising above 2.4.      With the Mayer indicator currently hovering at 1.67, bitcoin appears to be in the early stages of the bull market, with plenty of room to extend the rally from the low of $3,867 seen since mid-March.      According to Nischal Shetty, CEO of Mumbai-based crypto exchange WazirX, bitcoin is replicating price moves seen following previous halvings – four-yearly reductions in the rewards for miners. The cryptocurrency underwent its third halving on May 11, when prices were around $8,600.      While the recent sharp rise from $10,000 looks similar to the surge from $6,000 to $20,000 seen in November-December 2017, this time may be different. Institutions appear to have been the primary drivers of the latest rally, while the one seen three years ago was driven by speculative frenzy and panic buying by retail investors.      Google Trends, a barometer used to gauge retail interest in trending topics, is currently returning a value of 13 for the worldwide search query ""bitcoin price."" That's significantly lower than the value of 93 observed in early December 2017.      That's a likely sign that FOMO has yet to take hold of the market. Retail investors are usually the last to join a rally. As such, increased retail participation is widely considered a sign of an asset nearing a major top.

WazirX's Shetty expects retail investors to jump in once prices rise above $20,000.

The world's top cryptocurrency by market capitalization reached a high of $18,062 at 03:01 UTC, a price point not seen since Dec. 16, 2017. After topping out at almost $18,500, prices dropped back below $18,000 for around two hours before crossing the level again.      Over the past 24 hours, bitcoin has ranged between $16,560 and $18,464.      Bitcoin is now up 146% on a year-to-date basis and has gained nearly 70% so far this quarter, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      ""A few recent events have undoubtedly had an impact,"" said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner at crypto lender Nexo. ""Institutional investment by the likes of MicroStrategy and Square, PayPal actively shilling crypto, and the bitcoin halving in May"" were likely causes for bitcoin's continual rise, he said.      Others see global events such as COVID-19 and negative interest rates in traditional markets such as Germany as the outliers for bitcoin's meteoric rise this year.      ""Interest rates are the most important factor in people's decisions on where to deposit money,"" said Ki Young Ju, CEO at analytics firm CryptoQuant. ""I'm sure negative interest rates will drive adoption in crypto whether it's direct purchasing crypto/index funds or using staking services.""      While bitcoin is fast approaching its December 2017 all-time high of around $19,700, ether also broke new 2020 heights above $488 to stand at $489 by press time.      See also: Traders Brace for Major Volatility as Bitcoin Price Nears Record Highs      Another factor could be attributed to the easy money policies of central banks and increased government spending from some of the world's largest economies including Europe and the U.S in recent months.      ""I think it basically comes down to monetary and fiscal policy,"" said Kyle Davies, co-founder of Three Arrows Capital. ""Central banks can lower rates until they get to slightly negative, and then they have to print money.""      At that point, Davies maintains, central banks' dependency on newly printed money will make ""BTC attractive.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/18/bitcoin-closes-in-on-all-time-high-as-price-hits-18k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1e63826e9ce03e8cb27e175b3e67343dbf1a7cf1-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
