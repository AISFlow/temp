Congresswoman Maxine Waters asked Facebook to halt development of the Libra Network until hearings can be held. The move follows a letter written to her by her Republican counterpart, Representative Patrick McHenry.  McHenry wrote, ""We know there are many open questions as to the scope and scale of the project and how it will conform to our global financial regulatory framework,"" adding:  ""It is incumbent upon us as policymakers to understand Project Libra. We need to go beyond the rumors and speculations and provide a forum to assess this project and its potential unprecedented impact on the global financial system.""  In a statement, Waters said, ""with the announcement that it plans to create a cryptocurrency, Facebook is continuing its unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users.""  She added that there is currently no ""clear regulatory framework to provide strong protections for investors, consumers and the economy,"" when it comes to cryptocurrencies.  ""We look forward to responding to lawmakers’ questions as this process moves forward,"" a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement.  Growing crowd  Waters and McHenry joined a small, bipartisan group of lawmakers in expressing concern about the Libra project.  Earlier, Senate Banking Committee ranking member Sherrod Brown said on Twitter that Facebook has exploited user data in the past, and cannot be allowed ""to run a risky new cryptocurrency out of a Swiss bank account without oversight."" (The Libra currency will be governed by a Swiss foundation.)  The Senate Banking Committee wrote a letter to Facebook last month asking a number of questions about how the project would work and how Facebook would handle user data.

42430610,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwRVh,1560890409,Facebook's Cryptocurrency Is a Nail in the Coffin for 'Blockchain Not Bitcoin',"Edan Yago is the founder of CementDAO, an effort to bring together stablecoins into a unified ecosystem. The views expressed here are his own.      With the announcement of Libra, cryptocurrency has entered the big leagues.  Facebook's entry into this market means every single company now has to take cryptocurrency seriously. Companies around the world are now considering their cryptocurrency strategy.  This is not a repeat of the corporate circle-jerks of 2015 and 2017. Then, companies played with the idea of having a “blockchain” strategy. Blockchain was a buzzword and companies indulged their innovation departments in building toys that never saw the light of day as actual products. This time could not be more different. Facebook has hammered the final nail in the coffin of ""blockchain not bitcoin.""  Facebook has taken blockchain seriously. They understand that “the technology” isn’t cool. What’s cool are the unprecedented products that technology can be used to create: digital cash, new currencies and programmatic money. Every business ever has sought to make money.  Now, one of the biggest businesses in the world, has decided to dispense with the middle steps and go straight to the making money part.  “Why, the crypto pundits have been asking, 'Do they need a blockchain for this?'” Libra, after all, will be permissioned. They could have ""just used a database.""  The answer is simple. Even Facebook could not create this product without the (albeit limited) decentralization that blockchain affords. Facebook needs blockchain for this for the same reason any cryptocurrency needs blockchain. The only central actors that are allowed to issue money are regulated financial institutions. They need to be regulated anywhere that money is issued and used. That is hundreds of different jurisdictions with thousands of different regulations.  Blockchains are protocols that create money and transact money in the form of cryptographic proofs. They are unregulated for the same reason peer-to-peer encryption is unregulated: They are too abstract. The combination of decentralized governance and value that results from solving mathematical problems means that regulators even define laws that would be limited enough in scope to make sense and broad enough to be effective.  They have tried to regulate cryptography and encryption many times and always failed.  Up until now that was a curious fact that polite society had agreed to mostly ignore, sometimes with a derisive chuckle. From now on, it is a fact of business that serious-minded executives need to master.  Master it they will, and Facebook has laid out the playbook:  Decentralize as much as is necessary, but no more  Provide a token of stable value so that it can be used reliably in commerce  Leverage your existing ecosystem to gain users.  Do these things and you a whole world of profiting from seigniorage opens before you. Build loyalty that goes beyond just brand and product to the very means of paying for those products. Collect data previously unheard of, and attribute purchasing behavior to marketing in ways never before possible. Tax every transaction or the interest earned on funds held as reserves. And if you play your cards right, maybe even create money out of thin air.  The big leagues attract the big players. Banks, technology companies, giant retailers, telcos, now have no choice but to enter this game.  The world will not sit idly by and let Facebook own this new, phenomenal market opportunity. A thousand stablecoins are coming. Starbucks will let you buy your venti with ""Starbucks."" Verizon and AT&T will issue money as mobile and smart as the device already in your pocket.  Juul will give you discounts if you pay in Jems. The city of Venice will make tourists pay for the burden they have become in, what else, Ducats.  Sure, many of these products will have the same fate as Pets.com. Most products fail. So what? Money is a product now, and if there is one thing every business wants to do, it’s make money.

42430603,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwRLh,1560879945,CFTC Lawsuit Alleges $147 Million in Bitcoin Defrauded From Trading Scheme Investors,"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced the filing of a civil enforcement action against Control-Finance Limited, a purported Bitcoin trading and investment company, and its founder, Benjamin Reynolds, of the United Kingdom.  The complaint charges the defendants misappropriated at least 22,858.822 bitcoin—worth at least $147 million at the time—from more than 1,000 customers through a pyramid scheme called the Control-Finance “Affiliate Program.”  According to the documents, from May 1 through October 31, 2017, Reynolds exploited public enthusiasm for Bitcoin by fraudulently soliciting customers to purchase and transfer bitcoin to Control-Finance. He alleged his expert virtual currency traders earned up to 45% trading returns per month, and used risk diversification methods to create a “safe haven” from crypto market risks and protect customers’ Bitcoin deposits.  “In reality, the defendants made no trades on customers’ behalf, earned no trading profits for them, and misappropriated their Bitcoin deposits,” write the CFTC in a statement.  Reynolds also enticed his clients to invite family and friends to the platform through promises of “affiliate” bonuses.  The misappropriation scheme relied on creating unique single-use wallet addresses to receive customers’ Bitcoin deposits, which would then be routed to other, pooled wallet addresses held by virtual currency payment processors and exchanges in North America, Europe, and Asia. CFTC authorities allege these uneconomical and confusing blockchain transactions were executed solely to conceal misappropriation.  Additionally, when customers requested account withdrawals, Reynolds would illegally divert funds from other customer’s to make the payments.  Reynold’s concealed the fraud by providing customers with sham account balances and profit figures that falsely reflected trading profits that did not exist. Weekly “Trade Reports,” which identified illusory profitable trades were also fabricated.  In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties, restitution, rescission, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, trading and registration bans, and permanent injunctions against further violations of the federal commodity laws, as charged.  The complaint was lodged in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

42430612,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwRZh,1560879025,New Research Targets a Big Worry for Some Blockchains: Double-Spent Transactions,"A trio of researchers say they've discovered a way to detect and punish dishonest blockchain participants, according to a paper published at the end of May.  “The (virtual) gold rush is on, and as in the Wild West of yore, the outlaws are ever present,” states the paper, entitled Polygraph: Accountable Byzantine Agreement.  The authors -- Vincent Gramoli and Pierre Civit of the University of Sydney, and Seth Gilbert of the National University of Singapore -- developed the Polygraph protocol, which automates accountability in blockchains to hold participants accountable for double spending, a notoriously knotty issue in cryptography.  Though the double spend problem was supposedly solved by Satoshi’s white paper, published in 2008, the researchers discovered that disagreements caused by blockchain forks can lead to double spending if the resulting branches have conflicting transactions.  They cite a zombie case:  “Byzantine nodes can override the General Polygraph Protocol by proposing directly two conflicting views to two different clients to then perform a double-spending attack. The coalition does not participate to the consensus in order to violate the liveness property…. Note that safety is also violated: When a client invokes the read() primitive, the coalition can answer arbitrary values, despite the non-termination of the legitimate consensus. The client is supposed to trust the coalition, like all the other clients who can forever receive a different output for the read() primitive. Hence, for t ≥ n − t0, the eventual prefix property is violated. This makes the blockchain vulnerable to a double-spending attack.”  Real-world focus  Yes, the paper is scholarly, but it also provides pragmatic solutions to real problems in current consensus mechanisms.  The group considers the growing threat of centralization on blockchains, caused by the collectivizing of hashing power. Under traditional Byzantine protocol agreements, if one party amasses more than one-third of total mining output they gain decision making authority. As an aside, the authors note that the largest Bitcoin mining pool today controls approximately 19 percent of total hashing power.  “We need a new sheriff in town to bring the guilty parties to justice. What if, instead of preventing bad behavior by a party that controls too much of the network power, we guarantee accountability,” write the authors.  Much in the way we prevent crime in the real world, we can prevent bad blockchain behavior via “defense-in-depth” -- the basic Byzantine agreement protocol that prevents usurpation if the attacker has less than one-third of network control or if the network infrastructure is working to pass messages in time.  “Byzantine agreement protocols act as the locks on the bank doors, preventing the gangs from making off with the loot,” they wrote.  However, when these guarantees fail -- and the authors suggest they can and do -- the Polygraph protocol will intercept malicious behavior.  The Polygraph’s basic algorithm is based on the Byzantine agreement protocol, but goes further in that proceeds through asynchronous rounds, or a vote that receives democratic input.  “First, a reliable broadcaster is used to distribute the proposal values. Then, a second phase of communication is used to determine whether enough processes have converged on a single value. Finally the processes decide, if they can; and if not, they update their estimate in an attempt to converge on a single value.”  When a town isn't big enough...  If the process determines that someone is pursuing illegal actions, the consensus can vote them off the network.  ""Accountability has been overlooked in blockchains but it is actually key to security,” said Gramoli, who also serves as Red Belly Blockchain CEO. “The industry cannot accept blockchain to be a simple distributed system where valuable assets vanish as soon as a third of the participants form a coalition.”  Red Belly Blockchain has been funded by the Australian Research Council and developed by researchers of the Concurrent Systems Research Group at the University of Sydney and Data61-CSIRO.

Visitors are now able to use the point-of-sale service with cryptocurrencies to buy goods. The POS is located in Santander, Colombia, just across the border from Venezuela.  Panda Group created the payment alternative with refugees in mind. The group, a Columbian-Venezuela joint venture, announced the implementation of the new service through their Twitter account.  According to the data published by Coinatmradar.com, the service lets users exchange using bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH) and dai (DAI), and converts them into to Colombian Pesos (COP).  At the physical location - a small phone service provider in a mall called La Parada - customers can buy bitcoin with prices based on the Localbitcoins rate in pesos. The service will charge 10 percent above the market price and those who sell their bitcoins will do so for 5 percent more than the established market value.  This is not the first cryptocurrency service in the country. The Panda Group has already installed another five cryptocurrency exchanges in Colombia, most of them in the Colombian capital, Bogotá.  According to Panda CEO, Arley Lozano Jaramillo, their solutions are focused on helping the Venezuelan users and they announced the addition of a new service called Xpay.Cash to encourage adoption.  ""This service is for all our brothers to pay directly in Cucuta with their cryptoassets and mitigate the loss of exchanging from BTC to COP, which represents a loss of at least 20%,"" Jaramillo said.  Colombia has the highest rate of cryptocurrency investors in South America, next to Brazil. There are reportedly over 20 businesses accepting bitcoin payments in the country. The establishments are mainly focused in tourism, food and digital services.  Bitcoin at the Border  The ATM installed in Villa del Rosario City is connected to the Venezuelan border by the state of Tachira. The states are only separated by the Simon Bolivar International Bridge, one of the most heavily traveled borders used by Venezuelan refugees.  The refugee situation has also sparked a focus on the cryptocurrency, mainly for humanitarian aid purposes.  On the other hand, the last point of sale with cryptocurrency was implemented in Cúcuta, another border location with a growing Venezuelan population.

42430620,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwRnh,1560873654,Facebook Has Yet to Answer US Lawmakers' Questions About Libra Crypto,"Facebook is still working on its responses to a plethora of consumer protection questions about the Libra cryptocurrency asked by a group of U.S. senators last month.  The Senate Banking Committee wrote an open letter to Facebook at the beginning of May, asking the social media giant a number of questions about Libra, after word of the project leaked out in the press. The questions primarily centered around user privacy and data protection, though a few concerned the cryptocurrency network itself.  After months of speculation and rumors, the company formally unveiled its vision for Libra on Tuesday – but it has not yet submitted a response to the letter.  ""We received the letter and are addressing the senators' questions,"" a Facebook spokesperson told CoinDesk Tuesday morning.  Early clues  To be sure, the documentation Facebook published offers a hint of what the answers to some of the committee's questions might be.  Take, for example, the senators' first two questions:  How would this new cryptocurrency-based payment system work, and what outreach has there been to financial regulators to ensure it meets all legal and regulatory requirements?  What privacy and consumer protections would users have under the new payment system?  Facebook's new Libra white paper and supporting documentation outline the mechanism for the basket of fiat currencies and government securities that back the Libra token, as well as the Libra investment token that gives its governance council the ability to monitor and modify the network and its protocols.  Moreover, Facebook said in other documentation that it, or at least its new Calibra subsidiary, would secure money transmitter licenses in various U.S. states that treat cryptocurrencies as money. Calibra has also registered as a money services business (MSB) with the Financial Crime Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. (Though it is a legal requirement for businesses conducting financial transactions, registering as an MSB does not indicate any sort of regulatory approval.)  Calibra says it will also abide by European Union and Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidelines, as well as the laws of each jurisdiction it provides services in. Facebook has also reportedly held talks with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) about Libra.  The Senators also asked if Facebook shares or sells any consumer information (or information derived from such data) with any unaffiliated third parties. Company literature says that neither Facebook nor Calibra will do so without consent from the customer.  Stay tuned  Still, the senators may want more detailed answers to these questions and others, specifically:  What consumer financial information does Facebook have that it received from a financial company?  To the extent that Facebook has received such information, what does the company do with it and how does it safeguard the data?  Does Facebook have any information bearing on an individual's (or group of individuals') creditworthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics or mode of living that is used (either by Facebook or an unaffiliated third party) to establish eligibility for, or marketing of a product or service related to, credit, insurance, employment or housing?  How does Facebook ensure that such information is not used in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act?  The senators' letter did not give a deadline for Facebook to respond, and it is unclear when the answers will be sent.  UPDATE (June 18, 2019, 18:45 UTC): Senator Sherrod Brown, ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, said on Twitter that ""Facebook is already too big and too powerful, and it has used that power to exploit users’ data without protecting their privacy. We cannot allow Facebook to run a risky new cryptocurrency out of a Swiss bank account without oversight.""

42430618,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwRlh,1560870904,Facebook's New Crypto Faces Scrutiny From European Authorities,"The unveiling of Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency was immediately met with political opposition in Europe.  French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire and German member of the European Parliament Markus Ferber called for regulatory scrutiny of the social network's blockchain project, according to Bloomberg.  Facebook, with more than 2 billion users, could become a “shadow bank,” Ferber warned.  “Multinational corporations such as Facebook must not be allowed to operate in a regulatory nirvana when introducing virtual currencies,” he said, sounding the alarm for regulators to take a closer look.  Le Maire echoed this sentiment during an interview with Radio 1, when calling upon the Group of Seven central bank governors to prepare a report on Facebook’s project for their July meeting.  His concern is that Libra may grow to replace traditional currencies. Similar fears have been stoked by Italian Prime Minister Matteo Salvini’s recent prevarications around the mini-BOT, a proposed national currency that some analysts predict will shake the foundations of the European Union.  “It is out of question’’ that Libra be allowed “become a sovereign currency,” Le Maire said, adding:  “It can’t and it must not happen.”  Facebook’s initiative  to “build a financial ecosystem that can plug in and empower billions of people” was formally announced Tuesday after months of rumors and speculation. Libra is a stablecoin designed to tame the volatility of cryptocurrencies and thus be useful for day-to-day commerce. During its development, Facebook partnered with some of the biggest names in payments and technology, such as Visa, Uber, and Coinbase.  The currency is expected to launch in 2020 and will be pegged to a basket of established government-backed currencies and securities, designed to limit inflation and maintain liquidity, which will be controlled by the Libra Association. The Association will also purposefully burn or mint tokens in response to shifts in demand.  Calibra, a Facebook subsidiary, plans to build a digital wallet that will exist inside its Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp services to make it easy for people to send money to friends, family and businesses through the apps.

The details are emerging, but what we do know is that the asset will be called Libra, it will be a ""stablecoin"" (i.e. backed by a basket of assets in order to prevent it from being volatile) and there are so far 28 confirmed 'validators.' The cost to be a validator is $10 million (US dollar) each, there's a foundation in Switzerland and Facebook has stated that their main focus is to help facilitate payments across the developing world.  Facebook is essentially trying to create a stable medium of exchange that can be used for making payments across its networks and therefore across borders. Think the current functionality of WeChat, Venmo and PayPal but instead of transacting pounds and dollars, users will be transacting in Facebook’s Libra.  Let's cut to the chase, Facebook (and Libra's supporting corporations which include eBay, Visa, Uber and PayPal) are doing this for one reason and that's data. It will be spun as banking the unbanked, revolutionizing payments and connecting the world, but don't be fooled, this move into the murky world of cryptocurrency is about tapping new wells of data, the modern day oil.  No doubt there’ll be plenty of assertions over privacy protection and 'decentralized' hand waving, but this is all about Facebook enriching its reservoirs of data, knowing who you are (for real), what you're buying, who you're paying and how much you have.  This is why Facebook’s Libra will not compete with bitcoin but rather validates the underlying blockchain technology more than ever. Bitcoin is open, borderless, permissionless, censorship resistant, publicly verifiable and immutable.  Facebook’s coin cannot be any of these things because Facebook is a corporation, they have to exist within jurisdictions and comply with every rule ever devised by the legacy financial system including vetting every participant, and unlike bitcoin's blockchain, Facebook cannot be neutral in regard to who is using its system.  Further, adding a consortium of global companies as validators does nothing to decentralize the system. All the validators are known and as such can be fully ""leaned on"" to adhere to the pressures that exist from the global financial systems.  So, if bitcoin doesn't need to worry (indeed it's possible Libra may even help bitcoin adoption by potentially driving millions of people to seek out what a real cryptocurrency is) whose piece of the pie is Facebook taking? You've guessed it, the banks.  To one side of them there's the open source, borderless bitcoin growing in adoption every day and on the other is Facebook with their 2.3 billion users.  Banks are being squeezed between two hugely powerful forces and remember Facebook have built a global phenomenon through reinventing what we've come to understand as a user experience. What they've done with interfaces, they're going to do with money, and in that arena, the banks don't have a chance.  Want a loan? Ask Zuckerberg. Want a credit card? Ask Zuckerberg. Everything will be at the click of a button on a platform that literally 30 percent of the planet's population are using.  Further, Libra could crush merchant fees and potentially solve major issues with card fraud. If that wasn't enough, if Libra is successful in seeing widespread adoption, watch a slew of new coins come to market from the other Silicon Valley heavyweights.  Money is the next frontier for the candy crushing, social networking leviathans and I for one would not want to be standing in their way.  Editor's note: Have a reaction to the Facebook news?

42430605,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwRPh,1560864644,Binance to Launch Bitcoin-Pegged Token on Its Own Blockchain,"Binance will issue a number of tokens pegged to leading cryptocurrencies on Binance Chain to boost the number of trading options on its platform.  The tokens are also likely to be extended to Binance DEX, the firm's recently launched decentralized exchange, as they create the potential to in effect move cryptos from different blockchains onto its network.  The company said in a blog post that it expects to release the first such token – one pegged to bitcoin and to be listed as BTCB – in the coming days. A trading pair will be created on Binance.com between the pegged token and bitcoin (BTCB/BTC).  The crypto-pegged tokens, based on the exchange's BEP2 format, will be backed by Binance's reserves of the pegged cryptocurrency. Before the news was announced Monday, CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao tweeted a warning of an impending move of bitcoin for the purpose.    There will be a transfer of 9001 BTC soon, no need to FUD. It's for a good thing, details to follow. Waiting for whale_alert.        — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) June 17, 2019      Binance explained in the post:  “Large buy orders will be maintained on the trading pair on Binance.com, with a price spread of around 0.1%. This provides an easy way for anyone to convert from the pegged token back into the native coin on Binance.com. If this buy order is filled, a new order will be placed while an equal amount of funds will be deposited from the reserve address into Binance.com. The sum of the buy order and the funds on the published reserve address will be bigger than the total supply of the pegged token, ensuring there is always 100% backing.”  The Binance team reasoned that the increase in the selection of tokens available on Binance DEX will increase trading volume and liquidity, thereby furthering the utility and value of the platform.  Also noteworthy is that Binance is eschewing the option to use to cross-chain atomic swaps or other decentralized approaches to enable exchanges of non-native tokens on the DEX.  The company said:  ""While this approach is more centralized than atomic swaps, we believe it provides a higher degree of ease-of-use to most traders. And most traders are already trusting Binance.com to hold their funds anyway.""  In the post, the firm said that the new tokens are ""proposed"" for launch on Binance DEX currently.  Additionally, because the reserve addresses will be published on the blockchain, Binance said the new crypto-pegged tokens will be easier to audit than traditional bank reserves.  The company is encouraging clients to issue pegged tokens of their own coins on the Binance Chain, offering (though not guaranteeing) to facilitate a pegged/native pair.  Earlier this month, Binance also confirmed to Bloomberg that it would soon launch stablecoins on its chain too.  Chief financial officer, Wei Zhou, said the first stablecoin offering, to be linked to the British pound, will be live on the platform “in a matter of weeks to a month or two.”  Changpeng Zhao image courtesy of Binance",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/18/binance-to-launch-bitcoin-pegged-token-on-its-own-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4a8bcd4a801ec8788b61b098e7151d2827c9029d-1500x911.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Launched  in March and available in 19 countries of the European Union, 2Gether now supports nine tokens, including bitcoin, ether, XRP, bitcoin cash, EOS, Stellar, litecoin, QTUM and dash. Users can buy and sell cryptos using an iOS or Android app, as well as pay for goods and withdraw cash in the ATMs against their crypto holdings.  On the backend, the company would exchange clients' crypto for fiat and send euros to the counterparties that accept a payment — the same principle is employed by 2gether's rival, Coinbase Card, launched in April in partnership with the U.K. payment processor PaySafe.  Explaining the decision to add dash to the variety of tokens supported, 2gether said in a press release that dash, an early fork from the bitcoin protocol, ""have become the solution in crisis-stricken countries like Venezuela and Thailand, which has prompted greater demand for the coin in the global sphere.""  2gether CEO Ramon Ferraz, who joined the startup after years at consulting firms A.T. Kearney and Deloitte, said the dash partnership is important for the firm as it's ""one of the most widely-used cryptocurrencies"" globally. ""Adding dash to our list of nine cryptocurrencies opens us to new markets in order to expand our reach and visibility outside the eurozone,” he added in his statement.  Ryan Taylor, CEO of Dash Core Group, said: ""The addition of dash to 2gether’s platform helps strengthen the bridge between crypto and fiat-based financial markets, and provides more ways for eurozone citizens to reap the benefits of decentralized payments.""  The dash community has been working to stimulate adoption of the cryptocurrency in countries with high levels of unbanked citizens and extremely volatile local currencies. For example, the Dash Treasury DAO, the pool of mining rewards, has granted over $33 million-worth of dash since 2015, including $2.3 million for projects in developing countries such as Zimbabwe, Ghana and Kenya.

42430602,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwRNh,1560861018,70% of Crypto Exchanges Have Complied With CoinMarketCap's Transparency Initiative,"Crypto data provider CoinMarketCap says most listed exchanges have complied with its transparency-boosting mandatory data requests.  The news marks the end of the first phase of the site's Data Accountability & Transparency Alliance (DATA) initiative, which pushes for stricter disclosures, which include live trading and order book data. More accurate, timely and unbiased information will enable site users to draw more informed conclusions from CoinMarketCap data, the firm said in a statement.  “The new and detailed criteria for listings will provide clear and concrete guidelines for everyone looking to be listed on CoinMarketCap,” said Carylyne Chan, global head of marketing at CoinMarketCap. “We want to be as exhaustive as possible, eventually listing every qualifying project and exchange on CoinMarketCap!”  Currently listed cryptocurrency exchanges were given 45 days to respond and submit the queried information beginning on May 1.  The company confirmed over the weekend that 70.3 percent of all currently listed exchanges have fulfilled the expected requirements, and will continue to be included in CoinMarketCap's calculations of volume-weighted average price and adjusted trading volume.  “We are highly encouraged after seeing strong support for our DATA initiative so far,” said Chan. “With these submitted data points, we aim to provide more meaningful analyses and metrics for our users, and empower them with information to do their own research even more effectively.”  Exchanges that have not submitted the requisite information will be listed below those that have done so on the rankings. However, firms that submit the requested data will have their positions restored on a rolling basis.  CoinMarketCap also intends to bolster its “previously laconic listing requirements,” by expanding the set of measures that it uses to evaluate projects and exchanges, including factors such as trading volume, community interest, traction, team, product-market fit, impact, uniqueness and time in market.  While listing requirements are becoming more stringent, CoinMarketCap has also unveiled an “untracked listing” category, so projects that miss the minimum requirements for tracking market data can still appear on the website. To progress into the more dignified “tracked listing,” companies will have to ""exhibit strengths in a number of areas [during] the revised evaluation.”  The company is also championing transparency within its own internal strategies, for the first time publishing its delisting policy. Some notable causes for delisting include “low liquidity or suspicious trading activity, cessation of business, and misleading or deceptive initial applications that were later found out, unlawful activity,"" according to the statement.  CoinMarketCap is currently preparing for its first DATA roundtable with alliance partners, slated for sometime in mid July. Discussion topics may include standardization of definitions, tickers, and data disclosures via API, as well as confirming the DATA Phase 2 metrics to be collected.

The Elliott wave principle is a type of technical analysis for predicting prices in financial markets by looking at recurring patterns. In a video that he uploaded to YouTube, the analyst explains that the tool does linear calculations when in logarithmic charts, which he notes is a significant issue for Elliot wave traders. The official Twitter account of the company behind the charting service answered his tweet, announcing that the issue is being investigated, to which Cryptoteddybear answered: “Thank you @tradingview for finally taking this issue seriously.” The first reports of the bug, posted over five years ago (in November 2014) on consumer community platform getsatisfaction, have been reportedly ignored by the company. Another report submitted on the same platform, dated June 3, 2017, has seen the official TradingView account answer in the thread: “Hi, you are right, we have a planned task to fix this. Thanks for bringing this to our attention.” However, the problem apparently has not yet been solved.

42430617,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwRhh,1560859224,"Microsoft, Salesforce Join Hyperledger Enterprise Blockchain Consortium","Two of the world's largest top-10 enterprise software companies by revenue have joined the Hyperledger blockchain consortium.  Microsoft and Salesforce  are among the eight new members announced by Hyperledger Tuesday. The recruits also include Norilsk Nickel (Nornickel), a Russian metal company; Gloscad, a Polish tech company developing solutions for the agriculture industry; and Milligan Partners, a U.S.-based consulting firm focused on tech solutions for supply-chain management.  As members, these companies will pay dues based on their size to Hyperledger, an umbrella project for various business blockchains run by the Linux Foundation, and will build applications using the technology.  ""Our relations with Microsoft and Salesforce go back a year, so it's a nice culmination of it,"" Hyperledger executive director Brian Behlendorf told CoinDesk, adding:  ""Now it's not an academic interest [for Hyperledger] from their side anymore, it's something they want to take part in.""  Another three organizations have joined as associate members: China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), a Chinese government think tank; the Ethereum Foundation, which supports the development of the world's second-largest blockchain; and GS1, which develops standards for barcodes.  This category does not require payment of dues and includes non-profits, open-source projects and government entities. The Ethereum Foundation's joining follows an alliance forged in October between Hyperledger and the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, which develops standards for business applications built on private and public versions of that blockchain.  Behlendorf called the line-up of new members a promising sign for enterprise blockchain in general. While the cryptocurrency market has been through turbulent times (the boom of 2017 and crypto winter of 2018), ""on the enterprise side, it wasn’t that dramatic,"" Behlendorf said.  And although some have questioned if the enterprise blockchain space was going to finally get projects into production, the new batch of big names in the Hyperledger fold is ""an indication that this space is still where a lot of value is expected,"" according to Behlendorf.  ""It doesn't feel like winter over here,"" he said.  Giants joining forces  Microsoft has been in the blockchain space for several years with a special focus on decentralized identity. The company is involved with standard-setting organizations in the identity space, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), and recently released its open-source decentralized identity solution based on the bitcoin blockchain.  As for Hyperledger, Microsoft offers the consortium's Fabric platform as a blockchain option on its cloud service Azure. Now, as part of the consortium, Microsoft will be joining its longtime rival and the company that contributed the Fabric enterprise platform to Hyperledger, IBM.  “Our journey in the blockchain ecosystem has brought us a long way, and now is the time for us to join the Hyperledger community,” Marley Gray, principal architect for blockchain engineering at Microsoft, said in Hyperledger's press release.  Salesforce, an IT giant comparable to Microsoft, made its blockchain debut recently, announcing the Salesforce Blockchain, a product for building and maintaining blockchain networks based on Hyperledger Sawtooth. Salesforce also named three clients that are testing the product, the data research company IQVIA, the rating agency S&P Global and Arizona State University.  ""We needed a technology that could be deeply customized with our Lightning Platform, and Hyperledger Sawtooth provided us with the robust flexibility to implement our customization,"" Ramya Subramani, senior director for engineering at Salesforce Emerging Technology, told CoinDesk.  Metal-backed coin  Though perhaps not as familiar a name in tech circles as the other new Hyperledger members, Nornickel is the world's largest producer of palladium and one of the leaders for nickel and copper. The company has been exploring the opportunities of blockchains for a while, working on a tokenization platform on Hyperledger Fabric, which is scheduled for launch until the end of 2019.  Nornickel is going to tokenize the volumes of the metals it's producing, including the contractual volumes within existing industrial consumers. By doing that, the company has ambitions to introduce ""new types of financial tools,"" available to a wide range of investors, including retail, Nornickel said in the company's press release.  “Hyperledger is our core technology,"" Sergey Batekhin, senior vice president for sales, procurement, and innovation at Nornickel, said. ""By joining Hyperledger, we plan to share our expertise and knowledge to improve blockchain technology. Our company has formed a considerable pool of ideas, concepts and initiatives that can be offered to other industry players.""  Brian Behlendorf noted that as a new member, Nornickel will connect Hyperledger to a wider pool of tech talent in Russia.  ""Hyperledger is a global effort spanning many different industries, and our relationship with Norilsk Nickel not only brings us a greater developer and community presence in Russia, but also new use cases in major global industries,"" he said.  According to Emily Fisher, a spokesperson for the Linux Foundation, with the new participants, Hyperledger now has 270 members. Some of them recently went into production, like the IBM Food Trust, the global tracking system for produce with giants like Carrefour, Walmart, Nestle, and Unilever aboard.

Revealed Tuesday in a press release, IBM fellow and CTO Jerry Cuomo described IBM’s vision for the service as a ""fully-flexible blockchain platform, built around a well-managed open source distributed ledger technology, that can truly run in virtually any computing infrastructure.""  The rearchitected IBM Blockchain Platform allows clients to deploy to public clouds like IBM Cloud, AWS and Azure, or on company-hosted private clouds like LinuxOne. It's also added support for app management and deployment platform Kubernetes.  ""This hybrid and multicloud approach will allow blockchain networks to work effectively across multiple environments,"" said Cuomo.  In addition, the revamped IBM Blockchain Platform has a number of new or improved capabilities allowing firms to manage the entire lifecycle of a blockchain network, according to the release.  For example, Cuomo cites the new IBM Blockchain Platform Extension for Visual Studio (VS) Code, which is designed to simplify the complexities of building with blockchain, helping users integrate their smart contract development and network management functions.  Cuomo explained:  ""Developers can now easily move from development to test to production from a single console. Included within the extension are code samples and tutorials, enabling any developer to easily become a blockchain developer. The IBM Blockchain Platform meets developers where they are, offering support for smart contracts to be written in JavaScript, Java, and Go languages.""  IBM Blockchain Platform has also added the ability for projects to deploy blockchain components only where and when they are required, and all manageable in one place. Users also have ""complete control"" of identities, ledger and smart contracts.  The offering further features a new pricing model that allows firms to ""start small,"" paying just for the services they use, and increasing payments as they scale.

42430624,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwRth,1560855617,Bitcoin Price Trades Flat on Facebook Libra Blockchain Launch,"View  The unveiling of Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency has failed to put a strong bid under BTC. The cryptocurrency may be vulnerable to a “sell the fact” pullback, too.  The 4-hour chart indicates scope for a drop to $8,800. A break lower would expose key average located at $8,500.  On the higher side, a high-volume above the crucial Fibonacci retracement level of $9,442 is needed to strengthen the case for a rise to $10,000.      Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to gather upside traction following Facebook's official announcement of its Libra cryptocurrency project.  At 09:00 UTC today, the social media giant unveiled its highly anticipated and until-now secretive cryptocurrency, Libra, which will run on a blockchain network secured at launch by 100 distributed computer servers, or nodes.  Facebook’s foray into cryptocurrency is widely being referred to by some experts as the most bullish external tailwind for bitcoin in 2019/2020.  Even so, bitcoin's price is struggling to gain altitude, having added meager $80 following Facebook’s white paper launch. As of writing, the leading cryptocurrency by market value is changing hands at $9,214 – down 2.8 percent from a 13-month high of $9,477 hit on Tuesday.  Bitcoin’s lackluster response validates our argument put forward on Monday that the markets priced in the news over the weekend, when the cryptocurrency rallied from $8,200 to highs above $9,300.  As a result, bitcoin now faces the risk of a “sell the fact” price pullback, with the short duration technical charts telling a similar story signals.  4-hour chart  The relative strength index (RSI) has produced lower highs over the last 24 hours, contradicting the higher highs on price.  That bearish divergence indicates the bulls are running out of steam and a correction could be in the offing.  The indicator has also dived out of the ascending trendline. Further, buy volumes (green bars) have been lower than sell volumes (red bars) over the last 48 hours, also implying buyer exhaustion.  The price could drop to key support at $8,821 (marked by horizontal line) over the next 24 hours. A violation there would expose the 10-day price average, currently located at $8,500.  In fact, a much deeper pullback could be seen if consensus builds in the marketplace that Facebook’s Libra is a more stable, cheaper and an easier to use medium of exchange than bitcoin. After all, Facebook wants to tap into bitcoin’s potential market of unbanked citizens in nations with high inflation, which could be ""bad news for bitcoin,"" tweeted Peter Schiff, CEO of Euro Pacific Capital.  That said, the bullish case would strengthen if BTC finds high-volume acceptance above $9,442 – the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from December 2017 highs to December 2018 lows. That would open the doors to $10,000.

42430619,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwRjh,1560852002,Libra White Paper Shows How Facebook Borrowed From Bitcoin and Ethereum,"With the long-awaited Libra white paper, Facebook is showing off its blockchain smarts, and making a bid for crypto credibility.  Released Tuesday morning, the 29-page paper describes a protocol designed to evolve as it powers a new global currency. More than a year in the making, the document opens by trumpeting the new blockchain's ambitious goal:  ""The Libra Blockchain is a decentralized, programmable database designed to support a low-volatility cryptocurrency that will have the ability to serve as an efficient medium of exchange for billions of people around the world.""  As a first step toward achieving the ""decentralized"" part, the protocol has been turned over to a new organization, the Libra Association, whose members will hold separate tokens allowing them on-chain voting rights to govern decisions about Libra.  ""Over time, it’s designed to transition the node membership from these founding members who have a stake in the creation of the ecosystem to people who hold Libra and have a stake in the ecosystem as a whole,” Ben Maurer, Facebook's blockchain technical lead, told CoinDesk in an exclusive interview.  In short, Libra is designed to be a high throughput, global blockchain, one that's built with programmable money in mind but limits how much users can do initially as it evolves from prototype to a robust ecosystem.  Unlike many other blockchains, Libra seems laser-focused on payments and other financial use cases for consumers.  But the white paper itself seems geared to demonstrate both Facebook's proposed advances to the science of distributed consensus and its appreciation for what has been built so far.  Indeed, over the last several months, many sources told CoinDesk they had visited Facebook to share their perspective on decentralized technology. The company has done a lot of homework.  And now it has created a new language for writing commands on its blockchain, called Move, and opened its software to public inspection.  ""To validate the design of the Libra protocol, we have built an open-source prototype implementation — Libra Core — in anticipation of a global collaborative effort to advance this new ecosystem,"" the white paper states.  “It’d be sort of presumptuous for us to say we’re creating an open environment and then say, ‘Well, but we’ve set everything in stone,’” Maurer told CoinDesk. “It’s a paper that requests feedback.”  Mix and match  Libra's designers have picked what they see as the best features of existing blockchains while providing their own updates and refinements.  1. Like bitcoin, there's no real identity on the blockchain.  From the perspective of the blockchain itself, you don't exist. Only public-private key pairs exist. The white paper states: ""The Libra protocol does not link accounts to a real-world identity. A user is free to create multiple accounts by generating multiple key-pairs. Accounts controlled by the same user have no inherent link to each other.""  2. Like Hyperledger, it's permissioned (at least to start).  Initially, the consensus structure for Libra will be dozens of organizations that will run nodes on the network, validating transactions. Each time consensus is voted on for a new set of transactions, a leader will be designated at random to count up the votes.  Libra opts to rely on familiarity rather than democracy to choose the right entities to establish consensus in the early days. ""Founding Members are organizations with established reputations, making it unlikely that they would act maliciously,"" the white paper states. These are entities range from traditional payment networks (Mastercard, Visa) to internet and gig-economy giants (eBay, Lyft) to blockchain natives (Xapo) to VCs (Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital).  3. Like tezos, it comes with on-chain governance.  The only entities that can vote at the outset are Founding Members. These members hold Libra Investment Tokens that give them voting rights on the network, where they can make decisions about managing the reserve and letting new validators join the network.  The governance structure is built into the Move software from the start, and like Tezos it is subject to revision over time. Updates will be essential as it adds members and evolves from what's more like a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) system (such as EOS or steem) to a fully decentralized proof-of-stake ecosystem.  4. Like ethereum, it makes currency programmable.  In a number of ways, the white paper defines interesting ways in which its users can interact with the core software and data structure. For example, anyone can make a non-voting replica of the blockchain or run various read commands associated with objects (such as smart contracts or a set of wallets) defined on Libra. Crucially, Libra's designers seem to agree with ethereum's that running code should have a cost, so all operations require payment of Libra as gas in order to run.  Unlike ethereum, Libra makes two important changes in its smart contracts. First, it limits how much users can do on the protocol at first (the full breadth of Move's features are not yet open). Second, it breaks data out from software, so one smart contract (what Move refers to as a ""module"") can be directed at any pool of assets, which Move calls ""resources."" So one set of code can be used on any number of wallets or collections of assets.  5. Also like ethereum, it thinks proof-of-stake is the future, but it is also not ready yet.  ""Over time, membership eligibility will shift to become completely open and based only on the member’s holdings of Libra,"" the white paper promises, describing a path to real permissionless-ness.  Meanwhile, the paper dismisses the approach of the blockchains with the longest track record (namely bitcoin), stating, ""We did not consider proof-of-work based protocols due to their poor performance and high energy (and environmental) costs.""  6. Like Binance's coin, it does a lot of burning.  Blockchains that build in purposeful burning of tokens became very influential last year. Binance, the world's leading exchange, created the BNB token, with which users could pay trading fees at a discount. Binance led the way to token bonfires, regularly burning a significant portion of its profits paid in BNB.  Libra won't use burning to enhance the value of its coin. Rather (as with collateralized stablecoins such as tether), tokens will be issued and burned constantly, as the association responds to demand shifts for its reserve, with no supply maximum or minimum supply.  7. Like coda, users don't need to hold onto the whole transaction history.  A lesser-known protocol, Coda, was one of the first to make its ledger disposable. Users only need to hold a proof of the last block, which they can easily check on a smartphone to be sure they are interacting with a valid ledger.  Similarly, on Libra, ""historical data may grow beyond the amount that can be handled by an individual server. Validators are free to discard historical data not needed to process new transactions.""  8. Like EOS, it hasn't worked everything out yet.  EOS launched without its approach to governance well defined, which yielded complications down the road. Similarly, Libra promises to decentralize, but there's nothing that inherently forces its members to do so.  Work in progress  Other matters are left undecided as well. For example, the storage of data.  ""We anticipate that as the system is used, eventually storage growth associated with accounts may become a problem,"" the white paper says. The document anticipates but does not define a system of rent for data storage.  It cites a number of examples of other open questions, such as how best to maintain security as more validators join the network, how often the pool of validators can change and how modules can be updated safely.  As the paper admits:  ""This paper is the first step toward building a technical infrastructure to support the Libra ecosystem. We are publishing this early report to seek feedback from the community on the initial design, the plans for evolving the system, and the currently unresolved research challenges discussed in the proposal.""  Dream team  The Libra white paper is signed by 53 people. Though senior Facebook executives such as CEO Mark Zuckerberg and blockchain lead David Marcus are notably absent from the author list, the team that wrote the document looks to be one of the most-heavy hitting in blockchain history.  The signatories hail from nearly every continent and include Ph.D. students from Stanford, computer science professors, and artificial intelligence (AI) developers.  They include:  Christian Catalini: The MIT professor was one of the first to study the economics of cryptocurrency alongside crowdfunding and tokenization. Catalini has written extensively for the Harvard Business Review and other publications.  Ben Maurer: Facebook's infrastructure engineer graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a degree in computer science. He and CMU assistant professor Luis von Ahn built the reCAPTCHA service that Google bought in 2009. He is leading the team that built the Move programming language.  George Danezis: A privacy engineer at University College London, Danezis was one of the creators of Chainspace and the Coconut protocol upon which Libra is based. He is currently a researcher at Facebook after the company bought his startup in February 2019.  François Garillot: A machine-learning and AI expert who worked at Swisscom and Skymind.ai, Garillot focuses on distributed AI.  Ramnik Arora: Arora spent time as an analyst at Goldman Sachs Investment Strategy Group as well as at IV Capital as a quant. His background is in finance and he has a master's in computer science from Stanford and an undergraduate degree in the mathematics of finance.  Zack Seward and John Biggs contributed reporting.

42430625,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwRvh,1560848451,There's a Second Token: A Breakdown of Facebook's Crypto Economy,"Actually, Facebook is launching two cryptocurrencies.  As part of Tuesday's big reveal of the social network's ambitious plan to create a global fiat-backed blockchain currency, Facebook said that in addition to Libra, the project will also issue a ""Libra investment token.""  Unlike Libra – a currency that will be broadly available to the public – the investment token is a security, according to Facebook. As such, the token will be sold to a much more exclusive audience: the founding corporate members of the project's governing consortium, known as the Libra Association, and accredited investors.  And while Libra will be backed by a basket of fiat currencies and government securities, interest earned on that collateral will go to holders of the investment tokens.  As previously reported  ahead of the official announcement, each of the 28 companies that Facebook recruited to run validating nodes as founding members of the consortium invested at least $10 million for the privilege. The investment token is what they received as a financial reward.  But that reward will only be meaningful if the network takes off.  ""Because the assets in the reserve are low risk and low yield, returns for early investors will only materialize if the network is successful and the reserve grows substantially in size,"" Facebook said in one of a series of documents that supplement the long-awaited Libra white paper.  Further, the tokens will give holders proportional clout in the early governance of Libra. An investor who buys the tokens doesn't have to run a node, but unless they do, they don't get to vote as members.  Governance  The Libra Association, a not-for-profit organization based in Switzerland, will have several layers of governance, the most powerful of which is a council, on which each member organization will have a representative.  ""The council delegates many of its executive powers to the association’s management but retains authority to override delegated decisions and keep key decisions to itself, with the most important ones requiring a greater than two-thirds supermajority,"" according to another supplementary document released by Facebook.  As mentioned, to become a member, the initial investors must put in at least $10 million. In addition, a business must meet at least one of several elite criteria, such as being on a list like the Fortune 500.  For every $10 million invested, a member gets one vote, subject to a cap of 1 percent of total votes, in order to prevent the concentration of power in any single entity. However, the financial reward remains proportional to the amount invested no matter how much.  The council will be responsible for standard governance matters, such as appointing an executive team for the association, led by a managing director, and a board of directors to oversee them; setting the top executive's compensation; and managing the currency's underlying reserves.  But the body will also have final say over technical questions, such as activating new features to the protocol and resolving situations ""where compromised validator nodes have resulted in many signed versions of the Libra Blockchain,"" according to the document.  While Facebook's newly created Calibra subsidiary will be a consortium member with a council seat, the social network stressed it won't be in charge for long.  ""Once the Libra network launches, Facebook, and its affiliates, will have the same commitments, privileges, and financial obligations as any other Founding Member,"" the company said. ""As one member among many, Facebook’s role in governance of the association will be equal to that of its peers.""  Reserves  The exact components of the basket of assets securing Libra are to be determined. But broadly, it will be ""structured with capital preservation and liquidity in mind,"" according to the social media giant.  Importantly, while the coin has been described in early press coverage as a stablecoin, Facebook noted that ""from the point of view of any specific currency, there will be fluctuations in the value of Libra.""  Rather than a fixed peg, the idea is to prevent bitcoin-style volatility:  ""The makeup of the reserve is designed to mitigate the likelihood and severity of these fluctuations, particularly in the negative direction (i.e., even in economic crises).""  In this way, Libra will function more like a currency board such as Hong Kong's rather than a central bank.  The collateral will consist of ""bank deposits and government securities in currencies from stable and reputable central banks,"" according to Facebook. The latter will be limited to ""debt from stable governments ... that are unlikely to experience high inflation.""  Rather than putting all its debt eggs into any single basket, no matter how creditworthy, ""the reserve has been diversified by selecting multiple governments, rather than just one.""  To make sure it can easily raise cash by selling this paper, it will all be ""short-dated securities issued by these governments, that are all traded in liquid markets.""  While the composition of the basket may change over time, Facebook said, the currency will always be fully backed, discouraging ""runs on the bank"" that can happen with fractional reserve institutions.  Compliance and privacy  To comply with anti-money-laundering regulations that require traceability of funds, transactions on the Libra blockchain will be unencrypted, ""like many other blockchains, so it is possible for third parties to do analysis to detect and penalize fraud,"" Facebook said.  In other words, it appears that there will be no use of cryptographic mechanisms such as zero-knowledge proofs, used to obscure transaction details in privacy-focused coins such as zcash.  If that raises privacy concerns (particularly given Facebook's own reputation with user data), the company is offering similar assurances to those Satoshi Nakamoto gave in the 2008 bitcoin white paper.  ""Individuals or organizations will operate on the Libra Blockchain through user accounts, which are dissociated from their real-world identity,"" Facebook said. ""Only data relevant to each transaction, such as the public address of the sender and receiver, the timestamp, and the transaction amount, are recorded and publicly visible.""  Data storage  Appearing to address concerns about Facebook’s track record with user data, company literature released Tuesday was blunt: ""Calibra will not share account information or financial data with Facebook, Inc. or any third party without customer consent,” adding:  ""Calibra customers’ account information and financial data will not be used to improve ad targeting on the Facebook, Inc. family of products.”  There are, however, ""limited cases"" where data may be shared, the document states, relating to the company's ""need to keep people safe, comply with the law, and provide basic functionality to the people who use Calibra.”  As part of its user experience, the app will allow people to import Facebook contacts to their Calibra wallets, to make sending funds easy. However, this feature will be opt-in, rather than automatic.  The company does intend to use aggregated Facebook data to inform upgrades for its product, including regional usage statistics for monitoring adoption rates.  “If someone fraudulently gains access to your account and you lose some Libra as a result, we’ll offer you a refund,” the release said. Password recovery will also be a feature, Facebook officials told CoinDesk.  Though the release noted that Facebook is “still early in the process of developing Calibra,” the product's aim is clear: to be “safe, private and easy to use for everyone.”  Nikhilesh De contributed reporting.

42430621,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwRph,1560848450,"Facebook Unveils Libra Cryptocurrency, Targeting 1.7 Billion Unbanked","You don't have to have a Facebook account to use Libra.  That's the hands-off approach the social media giant is working toward as it announces its new blockchain and the token of the same name that will run on top of it.  While Tuesday's announcement is still early days, the scope of the project is far-reaching. It includes a new Facebook subsidiary, Calibra, and an independent consortium, Libra Association, backed by some of tech's biggest names.  “Implied in this project is that wherever the Visa or Mastercard logo are accepted, Libra would follow suit,"" Dante Disparte, head of policy and communications for the Libra Association, told CoinDesk in an exclusive interview. ""In so many ways it’s a great leap forward for cryptocurrencies and, in many respects, a mainstreaming of this asset class.”  The Libra Association's group of 28 founding members includes Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Uber, Lyft, Coinbase and others.  Customers interested in holding or transferring Facebook's newly-announced Libra token will be given a number of options to do so, the company announced Tuesday, with an initial focus on international remittances.  Calibra  will develop financial services and products around the Libra network, which will eventually be fully governed by the independent Libra Association. Calibra intends to start with a digital wallet for the Libra coin, which will let users transfer funds to each other, as well as store their tokens locally.  Notably, customers will be able to access the wallet functionality through a new standalone app on iOS and Android, or through Facebook's Messenger and WhatsApp services. The Libra blockchain is expected to launch in full sometime next year.  “The central goal here really is financial inclusion,"" Disparte told CoinDesk.  Reaching the unbanked  Access to these apps could be enormously significant. WhatsApp saw 1.5 billion active monthly users in the fourth quarter of 2017, according to TechCrunch. Globally 1.7 billion adults remain unbanked. The new effort is explicitly branded to reach those populations.  “The goal of this new project ... is to build a financial ecosystem that can plug in and empower billions of people,” Disparte said.  For the major tech companies and financial institutions backing the project, that may one day mean access to more customers; for those struggling to access capital, it may one day mean a new lifeline from family abroad.  ""For many people around the world, even basic financial services are still out of reach: almost half of the adults in the world don’t have an active bank account, and those numbers are worse in developing countries and even worse for women,"" Calibra wrote in company literature published Tuesday, adding:  ""The cost of that exclusion is high – for example, approximately 70 percent of small businesses in developing countries lack access to credit, and $25 billion is lost by migrants every year through remittance fees.""  Among the payments giants, a number of NGOs are involved in the Libra Association, including Creative Destruction Lab, Kiva, Mercy Corps and Women’s World Banking. To become a “Social Impact Partner,"" participating non-profits must have a five-year track record of poverty alleviation work, including digital financial inclusion initiatives in the field, and an operating budget of greater than $50 million.  While Calibra is only targeting basic fund transfers to begin with, the subsidiary plans to expand its services to allow customers to pay bills and purchase goods or services, such as coffee or public transit access.  A video demonstrating the planned user interface indicates that customers will be able to quickly send funds to their friends. While they will be sending Libra coins, the app appears to show that users will see their balance in their local fiat currency.  Further, when sending funds across borders, the app appears to show the fiat equivalent that recipients will see, with amounts denominated in their local currencies.    “Just as the internet created a world of low-friction communication and information sharing, the hope with this public ecosystem and public utility is that we can create a world of value transfer and payment that has an equal low-friction property to it without sacrificing the governance standards in the traditional economy,” Disparte told CoinDesk.  Regulatory compliance  As part of its services, Calibra intends to follow various anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer regulations in the jurisdictions in which it conducts business, according to a fact sheet.  Calibra registered as a money service business with the U.S. Department of Treasury and is now working to acquire money transmitter licenses in U.S. states ""that treat cryptocurrencies as the equivalent of money.""  The subsidiary also intends to follow guidelines issued by the Financial Action Task Force and other national regulators, and will not conduct business in jurisdictions which have banned cryptocurrencies outright.  ""Calibra is committed to keeping illicit activity off the platform and working with law enforcement globally,"" the fact sheet said.  As part of its efforts to maintain compliance, Calibra will require ID verification. However, financial data and social media profiles will not be linked, according to company officials and the Libra white paper.  “The Libra protocol does not link accounts to a real-world identity,"" the white paper states. ""A user is free to create multiple accounts by generating multiple key-pairs.""  Other wallet providers will be able to build products on the Libra protocol when the network launches in early 2020, Facebook officials told CoinDesk.  The Calibra wallet will use similar verification and anti-fraud procedures that banks and credit card providers currently use, as well as systems to monitor accounts for unusual behavior in order to prevent fraudulent activity.  ""Authorities charged with consumer protection have an important role to play in ensuring that all consumers, including the most vulnerable, can safely take advantage of financial innovation,"" the fact sheet says.

42430622,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwRrh,1560848442,Facebook's Libra Cryptocurrency: A Technical Deep Dive,"Facebook announced Tuesday that its highly anticipated cryptocurrency, Libra, will run on a blockchain network secured at launch by 100 distributed computer servers, or nodes. Twenty-eight node-running members are currently on board.  The Libra blockchain will go live in 2020, with the Libra Association – a Switzerland-based non-profit – tasked with leading the cryptocurrency's ongoing development. In a white paper released Tuesday, the organization detailed how the Libra blockchain will be Byzantine fault-tolerant, meaning faulty behavior by some of the actors in the network will not compromise the security of the broader network.  It states:  ""[The Libra blockchain makes] it extraordinarily difficult for an attacker to compromise 33 separately run nodes that would be required to launch an attack against the system.""  All initial nodes tasked with validating transactions in the network will be run by ""Foundation Members."" The group of 28 founding members includes the likes of Visa, Mastercard, Coinbase, PayPal, Uber, Lyft and others, which are each investing around $10 million to join the consortium.  This contrasts with the more open approach of public blockchains like bitcoin or ethereum, in which anyone in the world can dedicate the computing power necessary to validate the network's transaction history. However, Libra's node participation will eventually open up to everyone.  “In the initial version of the system, only founding members will be able to be a node that participates in the consensus algorithm,"" Ben Maurer, Facebook's blockchain technical lead, explained to CoinDesk in an exclusive interview, adding:  ""Over time, it’s designed to transition the node membership from these founding members who have a stake in the creation of the ecosystem to people who hold Libra and have a stake in the ecosystem as a whole.""  Elsewhere in its announcement, Facebook noted how it intends to work alongside the existing financial system. For example, it noted specifically the regulatory issues of other blockchain products.  As more nodes are added, Facebook says Libra will become more fully decentralized.  ""The Libra ecosystem is diverse – the organizations that make up the pool of validator nodes are from a variety of industries and sectors and will be located in different places around the world,"" the white paper states. ""This will create a strong and distributed infrastructure, which will increase resiliency and ensure the validator nodes are not subject to common influence or attack.""  On Tuesday, the Libra Association published documents detailing the full cryptocurrency project, one in which Facebook played a ""key role"" in hatching. The aim of the Libra project as detailed in the white paper is to create a ""more accessible, more connected global financial system.""  Moving forward, Facebook is expected to maintain a leadership role over the initiative in 2019 but decision-making authority will ultimately rest with the non-profit Libra Association.  New programming language  Perhaps most notable of the project's technical specs is that Facebook has built a dedicated computer programming language called “Move” to run its new Libra blockchain.  ""The reason why we built our own language is that we want to really focus on the flexibility of the blockchain over time,"" Maurer told CoinDesk, adding:  ""One of the key ways to do that is by having programmability inside of the blockchain. If you want to take advantage of new functionality or new techniques, you don't have to wait for the entire network to upgrade.""  Facebook’s reason for creating a whole new language is to remedy the shortcomings of existing blockchains, Maurer explained.  ""In existing blockchains, there are a lot of issues with writing code securely,"" he said. ""The Move language is built with safety being a key principle of the design.""  According to a source with knowledge of the development process, clues to the technical implementation of the system could be found prior to Tuesday in Facebook’s February acquisition of Chainspace, a startup formed by a group of blockchain engineers at University College London.  “If you look at the stuff George Danezis and the technical team wrote on payment systems on the Coconut protocol, you will get a good flavor of some of the things they [Facebook] are looking to do, and the scale they are looking to do it at,” the source said, referring to an August 2018 white paper on the smart-contract protocol.  Danezis, as well as Chainspace's Shehar Bano and Alberto Sonnino, all work at Facebook now and are listed as signatories on the Libra white paper.  Privacy and security  At launch, the Libra Blockchain will require its members to be responsible for spinning up nodes that connect, participate and ultimately secure the Libra network.  These founding members include payments giants Mastercard, PayPal and Visa, as well as tech majors like eBay, Lyft, Spotify and Uber.  Staking startup Bison Trails is one of several crypto companies involved in the foundation.  Speaking to the roster of current partners, Bison Trails CEO Joe Lallouz told CoinDesk:  “One of the most impressive things, to me, about this project is how thoughtful they’ve been about truly making it distributed. Bringing on lots of partners to make sure there isn’t any centralization of decision-making or governance.""  All these organizations will have to ensure the software and hardware they are running for the Libra network is ""independent"" from all other internal company systems, the white paper states.  In addition, these nodes while validating and committing transactions to the Libra blockchain will not store any data on a user's real-world identity. Instead – following the example of traditional blockchain networks such as bitcoin – information about the users of the system will be restricted to their public alphanumeric blockchain addresses.  ""Transactions do not contain links to a user’s real-world identity,"" says the Libra white paper. ""This approach follows the norm of pseudonymous transactions adopted by other major blockchains. This approach is familiar to many users, developers and regulators.""  'Early-stage code'  ""Move is designed to make it safe to write programs that manage Libra assets,"" the white paper states.  Even so, the Libra Association is eager to have the Libra Blockchain and all its associated tooling fully inspected and secured by the broader public before its hopeful mainnet launch in the first half of 2020.  As such, the Libra Association has released ""early-stage code"" under a permissive and free software license by the Apache Software Foundation.  ""This testnet will help us gather feedback from the community about the direction of the project and work toward ensuring a scalable, reliable and secure launch,"" the Libra Association said.  To this, there will be a supplementary bug bounty program sponsored by the non-profit in partnership with cybersecurity company HackerOne to financially motivate researchers and developers in uncovering any hidden security and privacy vulnerabilities in the open-sourced code.  Speaking to the global motivations of not only the broader Libra project but this bug bounty program specifically, the Libra Association said:  ""The Libra Association is a global effort and so is the Libra Bug Bounty Program. We will be globally inclusive as we promote researcher contributions from all over the world and host bug bounty events in diverse locations.""  Leigh Cuen and Zack Seward contributed reporting.

Announced Tuesday, DA will be bringing its smart contract language DAML (Digital Asset Modelling Language) to R3’s Corda platform, as well as Hyperledger Fabric, following on from its Hyperledger Sawtooth tie-up last month.  DA co-founder Yuval Rooz had a tough act to follow, taking over as CEO from Wall Street legend Blythe Masters, who suddenly departed the company in December of last year.  He told CoinDesk:  “Since I’ve taken over, we have had integration announcements with Sawtooth and VMWare, and what you are seeing now is a continuation of that strategy. Ledger providers see an opportunity to bring more business to their ledger because DAML allows developers to build applications much faster.”  Another rather interesting partnership DA is kicking off is with Amazon Aurora, a non-blockchain traditional cloud database – driven by strong customer demand, said DA.  This echoes the AWS Quantum Ledger Database, which is also centralized and makes no pretensions towards being a bonafide blockchain. Rooz said he predicts more tie-ups between DAML and centralized database providers.  “We could actually capture a big piece of distributed applications today,” he said.  Stepping back  Stepping back to circa 2014-2015, firms like DA and R3 became pitted against one another, courting the same customers, and reminding them not to get caught in a Betamax versus VHS situation.  There also seemed to be a game of musical advisors playing out, as R3’s current CTO Richard Gendal Brown and Clearmatics head of research Tim Swanson advised the pre-Linux Foundation Hyperledger, which was acquired by Blythe Masters and Digital Asset Holdings as it was known then.  Later, Brown and Swanson joined R3 full time.  Dan O'Prey, CMO and head of DAML Community at DA, was also a co-founder of Hyperledger and remembers that back in the early days “out of necessity all companies looked like full stack providers so they had to build the ledger, they had to build the environment for smart contracts and solutions.”  The natural evolution of the blockchain space has required a change of strategy among firms noted O’Prey. For example, R3 made the strategic decision to focus on the platform with Corda, while DA is focused on a different layer of the stack, he said, adding:  “It’s fortunate for both of us we have decided to focus on different areas and that turns us from competitors to partners.”  Todd McDonald, R3 co-founder, and chief product officer agreed with this sentiment, but also highlighted how personality might have helped play a part. He told CoinDesk:  “The very first round table we had as R3, Yuval was there. There were only about 20 people in the room. So we have been chatting for a long, long time. And one of the first companies we worked with was Dan's old company, Hyperledger, before they were acquired. So there’s definitely a lot of overlap and back story.”  R3's Todd McDonald image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | WALLET | RESEARCH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/18/private-blockchains-biggest-startups-integrate-in-unprecedented-tie-up,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cb43ec8788ca6ce1085a4d184c6515fc8474c2bb-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430614,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwRdh,1560819920,Bitcoin Is Hedge Against Global Liquidity Crises: Grayscale Study,"Grayscale Investments, the cryptocurrency asset manager backed by Digital Currency Group, which acquired CoinDesk in 2016 – has released a report showing what it argues is bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against global liquidity crises.  Overall, the authors suggest bitcoin ought to be considered a strategic position within long-term investment portfolios considering its transparent, immutable and global liquidity. Bitcoin has a distinct set of properties unlike any other asset, the paper says, which allow it to perform well over the course of normal economic cycles as well as market disruptions.  Additionally, noting significant shifts taking place in monetary, fiscal and trade policies around the world, Grayscale alleges politicians and policymakers may find it increasingly difficult to manage their economies – thus insinuating a need for investors to take control of their own finances.  The report examined five recent macroeconomic shocks in which the digital asset outperformed other investments as a store of value. The authors extrapolated from these case studies – including Grexit, Brexit, China’s structural devaluation of the renminbi and two Trump shocks – that bitcoin could be a useful tool in helping investors insulate their portfolios from any potential market failures.  Below are three exegesis of bitcoin’s inherent ability to hedge against liquidity crises.  Bitcoin Gains as Grexit Loomed  In the first case study, 'Grexit and the 3-week Greek bank shutdown,' which spanned from April to July 2015, Greece underwent a physical liquidity crisis as default of sovereign debt seemed inevitable.  In a response to financial uncertainty, the Greek government closed state banks and imposed strict capital controls on transactions, beginning on June 28, 2015.  These restrictions remained in place for three weeks, while bailout terms were negotiated with international creditors, which sparked apprehensions about the unchecked power of governments over holders of centralized assets in times of crisis.  Yet, “during the liquidity freeze, bitcoin emerged as one of the only means by which to transfer value in or out of Greece, reinforcing this new asset’s ability to return the power of control to the individual who holds it,” write Grayscale analysts.  Leading up to the resolution to the Grexit crisis on July 13, 2015, bitcoin saw returns of 28 percent versus an average of -1.7 percent for 20 other markets and currencies.  State-led Devaluation  Another case study examined the People’s Bank of China’s structural devaluation of the renminbi, and China’s shift in monetary policy between August 2015 and December 2016.  Amid stock market turbulence and concerns over the health of the world’s second largest economy, the Chinese government lowered the RMB-USD reference rate 1.9 percent, signaling a shift to “market-driven” pricing and an attempt to stimulate export driven growth.  This policy-shift saw RMB’s largest single day drop in over twenty years, as well as a five-month selloff of global risk assets in favor of wealth preservation assets, according to researchers.  Again, Grayscale notes bitcoin fared much better.  “Between the day of the announcement and the trough of the drawdown, Bitcoin largely outperformed the following major markets and currencies, producing a cumulative return of 53.6 percent versus an average return of -10.1 percent.”  Bitcoin was used to hedge against Chinese liquidity risk, caused by local investors sold their assets against a structural currency devaluation.  Brexit, Bitcoin and Risk Management  The shock of the U.K.’s referendum vote to separate from the European Union was followed by a knee-jerk selloff and immediate decline in the pound sterling (GBP) and euro, as the market attempted to digest whether Brexit would portend the disintegration of the European Union.  During the first one-day global selloff, the researchers found, “bitcoin was a top performing asset, boasting a return of 7.1 percent on strong volume, versus an average of -2.1 percent for the rest of the group” of currencies.  Additionally, the researchers find cause to recommend, because the details of the transition plan still being worked out, global investors might consider allocating a portion of their investable assets to bitcoin to hedge against contagion stemming from the Eurozone, the world’s second largest economy.
