Avivah Litan, an IT industry analyst at Gartner, said in a survey, said that“75 [percent] of IoT technology adopters in the U.S. have already adopted blockchain or are planning to adopt it by the end of 2020 out of more than 500 U.S. companies.”      Blockchain technologies can create a trusted environment for data transmissions between virtual networks or devices while increasing efficiency of such exchanges, according to the survey.      According to Litan, of the 75 percent of blockchain adopters, 86 percent are implementing both IoT and blockchain in various projects.      The IoT companies aim to integrate computing devices with digital and mechanical machines to avoid human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.      For example, Apple Watch and Amazon Alexa are using these technologies in consumer goods. The technologies can also be used in the healthcare, industrial and military sectors.      Increased security and trust in shared multiparty transactions are the top benefits when the companies combine blockchain and IoT technologies, according to 63 percent of the survey respondents, while 56 percent said the top benefit is an increase in business efficiency and lower costs.      However, Litan cautioned that blockchain implementations related to protocol changes could be difficult for long-lived IoT devices due to its relatively high volatility.      “Some blockchain implementations struggle to scale to the transaction rates that can be generated by large numbers of connected things,” Litan said, expecting the necessary evolution in both blockchain and IoT to mature in five to 10 years.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/12/13/75-of-iot-firms-want-to-add-blockchain-survey,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/51cf92ff491a521bd8ef7bb2622f9d2488707ef0-1360x880.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42431277,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1Ozh,1576271755,Stellar Tried to Give Away 2B XLM Tokens on Keybase. Then the Spammers Came,"Spammers started showing up on Keybase as soon as Stellar announced a giant airdrop on the encryption app. They went away as soon as word went out that the free money era was over.      Or so Max Krohn, CEO of Keybase, told CoinDesk in an interview on Wednesday.      There's been discussion lately of a serious uptick in spam on the chat side of Keybase. The explanation for that apparently lies almost entirely in Keybase's partnership with the Stellar Development Foundation to airdrop 2 billion XLM to users of the app over a 20-month period.      ""It was really an interesting experiment,"" Krohn said. “In the end, it definitely achieved the goal of getting more numbers onto Keybase and more people onto Stellar.""    The trouble is, at a certain point the costs started to outweigh the benefits, as Keybase admitted when it announced the program was coming to an abrupt end. The third and finalhttps://keybase.io/a/i/r/d/r/o/p/spacedrop2019 XLM airdrop began today, Dec. 13.    What was advertised to be a 2 billion XLM giveaway will now be much less. “The total giveaway amount will have been 300 million Lumens (approximately $16,000,000 USD),” Keybase wrote.      An airdrop in crypto occurs when a protocol or company distributes its tokens to some set of internet users that it believes will advance the brand. Since cryptocurrency is fungible and easily exchangeable, this is effectively the same thing as handing out money. There was a big move into airdrops in early 2018 until regulatory concerns slowed the practice, especially in the U.S.      Stellar has run a few airdrops, most recently to users of Blockchain wallets.      For the partnership with Stellar, Keybase users could receive tens of dollars in XLM with each airdrop. Malicious usage started right away but it accelerated, Krohn said, and by the November airdrop it was already a serious problem. Eventually, the airdrop on Keybase attracted so many spammers that it was no longer worth trying to continue.      ""These airdrops are very hard to get right and in a way that is not overcome by fraud,"" Jed McCaleb, Stellar's founder, told CoinDesk at the Meridian Conference, a Mexico City gathering in early November.      As Keybase’s Krohn put it, the amount of crypto offered was too little for some to bother with, but for someone with the ability to write scripts to run a bot farm, it was potentially very lucrative. If a scammer could get hundreds or even thousands of bots through Keybase's checks for human-like behavior, it certainly became worth their while.      Stellar Development Foundation CEO Denelle Dixon told CoinDesk that the goal for both companies was to interest new people, and it did that well. Further, Keybase did a good job making XLM useable in the app, she said, which Stellar looks for in distribution partners.      ""They had developed a lot of interesting activities for users,"" she said, such as easily sharing XLM within a chat. ""We were really excited about it because we liked what Keybase stands for.""    'Immense operational strain'    Keybase went through several levels of checks before allowing accounts to join the airdrop.      On the first pass, any account that existed before the airdrop was announced was assumed to be real.      This worked well, but the whole purpose for both Stellar and Keybase was to bring new people in. So the next pass opened it slightly further. The partners said that any new account verified on Hacker News or GitHub would also be permitted to join the airdrop.      Stepping back, Keybase is an app that makes encryption via PGP easier. Most people use it for chat but it also has collaboration and developer tools built in, among other things. Encrypted communication is more reliable if the identity of users is verified, so Keybase uses various forms of social proofs to increase confidence that accounts represent the people they claim to be.      For example, Keybase has users cryptographically sign statements on other services to prove to Keybase that they are real.      This works across many websites, but Keybase and Stellar chose to start with Hacker News and GitHub because they both have high-quality communities that were not attractive to bots.      However, this led to spammers pouncing on these two services and looking to see if they could access dormant accounts. Bot farms have access to the millions of user IDs and passwords that have been compromised over the years. It's a simple matter to write a script to check a site to see if any of those credentials work for old, unused accounts.      In short, if bot farms could activate a long-forgotten GitHub account, then they could pass Keybase's filter. Both GitHub and Hacker News contacted Keybase to say the onslaught ""was causing immense operational strain,"" according to Krohn.      ""In our mind, we thought it would be advantageous to all partners,"" Krohn said. After all, it seemed to be an added benefit for users of Hacker News and GitHub. ""The second they asked us to turn it off we said, ‘Sure.’""      Final phase    For the November airdrop, Keybase decided to use a combination of SMS verification and its own filters to demonstrate human-like behavior.      Krohn said about 150,000 new signups made it through.      ""The bots are this adaptive adversary,"" Krohn said. Different bot shops deploy different strategies to get through. Keybase can't really know how many beat its system.      One additional challenge was the footprint of Stellar.      ""They have a lot of initiatives going on in Latin America and Nigeria, but those are also some of the hardest countries from which to combat bot signups,"" Krohn said. Limited internet infrastructure in those places gives fewer distinct signals from which to analyze behaviors of new accounts.      Krohn said they continued to be in contact with Stellar but at a certain point the benefits were no longer ""growing as fast as the abuse,"" Krohn said. And that’s why the airdrop is no more.      Prior to this writing, Keybase had already quit accepting new signups to receive the airdrop and recently added a strong blocking feature to its app.      For her part, Stellar’s Dixon hopes that more talented people continue to take on spam blocking. Prior to Keybase, she served at Mozilla, advancing the cause of the World Wide Web. She was philosophical about spammers ending their airdrop early.      ""That's just part of dealing with life on the web, especially when you do it in the open,"" she said.",NEGATIVE,XLM,BLOCKCHAIN | XLM | AIRDROP,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/13/stellar-tried-to-give-away-2b-xlm-tokens-on-keybase-then-the-spammers-came,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/877386800bb60d56ce3e7e4a73539db46e701d30-1500x929.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42431283,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1PBh,1576271015,Accenture Picked to Build Sweden's E-Krona Digital Currency Pilot,"Sweden’s central bank has tapped Accenture to develop its e-krona digital currency pilot project, the Riksbank announced in a press release Friday.      Accenture will build out the e-krona’s consumer-facing features – such as how a user would pay on various mobile platforms – and run them in a test environment with “simulated stores.” Its initial contract lasts for one year, but Riksbank said it is open to as many as seven years of tests.      Riksbank hasn't committed to issuing an e-krona at this time.      Regardless of the limitations, the partnership, which the central bank intends to sign later this year, is set to move the Scandinavian nation’s long-awaited e-krona one step closer to reality.      Such a development could tap into Sweden’s growing aversion to physical cash. Swedes have flocked so readily to cashless payment alternatives that the Bank of Canada’s Deputy Governor Timothy Lane said physical kronas are falling out of use.      “You’re actually reaching a tipping point [in Sweden],” Lane said at the Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s November Fintech conference. “Merchants are increasingly refusing to accept banknotes and banks are increasingly not offering services to process banknotes.”      Cash-free financial headwinds prompted Riksbank to begin studying an e-krona long before the more recent central bank digital currency (CBDC) rush. In 2016 the bank’s Deputy Governor Cecilia Skingsley said Riksbank was “facing pressure” to move away from coins and bills the public largely balked at.      It then began to study an e-krona in depth. Two reports, the first in September 2017 and a followup one year later, outlined everything from a digital currency’s legal ramifications to its impact on bank lending rates.      Notably, those reports revealed Riksbank’s reticence to base any such digital currency on a blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT), which Riksbank labeled an “inefficient technology.” But its 2018 report nonetheless stated that “an e-krona should be able to interact with DLT solutions.”      It is not clear what technology Accenture’s proposed e-krona will utilize. Riksbank classified the procurement process in its June 2019 proposal solicitation, calling the information “important to national security” in a press release at the time.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/12/13/accenture-picked-to-build-swedens-e-krona-digital-currency-pilot,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/71f98e85910140d9998593f079c802b64dc51403-1000x662.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431298,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1PZh,1576268910,"Highest in 2 Years: 65% of Bitcoin Hash Power Is in China, Report Finds","For all of bitcoin’s promise of being the world’s first decentralized, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, 65 percent of the total hash power resides in China. That's the highest in at least two years according to a recent report by CoinShares Research.      Skeptics like economist Nouriel Roubin often claim there is a massive centralization of power among miners and the blockchain is not even close to decentralization and democracy. That the majority of bitcoin’s hashrate is being supplied by China adds weight to their charges.      The hashrate refers to the computing power dedicated to mine blocks and secure the network. At press time, bitcoin’s hashrate stands at 91.34 exa hashes per second (EH/s), according to bitfinfocharts.com.      It is likely the world’s second-largest economy has the biggest influence on the top cryptocurrency. If a couple of big Chinese miners were to switch off, the hashrate will likely drop sharply, making the network less secure.       The majority of bitcoin mining power resides in China mainly due to natural factors. A mining market analyst at bitcoin asset manager and trading platform RRMine, who asked not to be named, told CoinDesk:      “China is a large country and there are many poorly developed areas with low-price, abundant electricity, such as Xinjiang, Yunnan, Inner Mongolia and Sichuan. As we all know, electricity costs and mining machines are two important factors for mining costs, so mining companies and individual miners prefer setting up mines in China.”      Half of the global mining power is located in Sichuan, which has an ample supply of cheap hydroelectricity.      Further, major improvements have been made in the mining hardware over the last year or so and most of that has been predominantly installed in China, according to CoinShare’s Chris Bendiksen.      The upgraded hardware includes the likes of Bitmain’s Antminer 15 and 17 series and MicroBT’s Whatsminer 10 and 20 series, which work significantly faster to produce as much as five times the hashrate per unit as their predecessors.      China’s hashrate dominance will likely fall in the long run, as the latest generation hardware is expected to make an entry into the non-Chinese market. Meanwhile, politically stable and well-connected countries like Norway, with abundant hydropower potential, are likely to become mining powerhouses.      Bitmain is already building the world’s largest bitcoin mining farm in Texas, which has abundant power resources.    Global hashrate to rise ahead of halving    The hashrate has risen sharply from 50 EH/s in June to 91 EH/s at press time, having peaked at 100 EH/s in October.      The surge in bitcoin’s required computing power was fueled by its price rally from $4,000 to $13,000 in the four months preceding July. Miners’ willingness to use high-power mining machines and expectations of further price rally ahead of the May 2020 reward halving also upped the hashrate, according to RRMine analysts.      The halving will reduce the reward per block mined from current 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC. Miners, therefore, would want to mine as many bitcoins as possible before the reward is reduced substantially in May.      Further, RRMine analysts are expecting the price to peak and boost mining profitability ahead of halving. It's worth noting that historically, bitcoin has put on a good show in the six months leading up to the supply-cutting event.

The Bottle Pay app once allowed users to send tiny amounts of bitcoin using just social media texts and handles, from Twitter to Telegram. There are roughly 974 members in the project’s Telegram group.      The London-based company raised $2 million in September, The Block reported at the time. Back in December, the team declined to name any of the investors but said the startup already served 10,000 user accounts.      Bottle Pay finally released a public beta with real bitcoin in late November, and just now realized new European regulations would dramatically alter the company’s roadmap.      “The amount and type of extra personal information we would be required to collect from our users would alter the current user experience so radically, and so negatively, that we are not willing to force this onto our community,” the company said in a statement, adding the team never charged for this service, added routing fees or sold anything to users.    First of many?    Bottle Pay won’t be the only British crypto startup impacted by the regulations, which require a strict user verification process. Similarly, the exchange Bitpanda announced on Friday it will roll out a new user registration process. Jon Matonis, chief economist at Canada's Cypherpunk Holdings Inc., tweeted this policy applies to custodial crypto wallets.      The privacy-focused wallet Samourai Wallet, which isn’t publicly registered in any specific jurisdiction, tweeted earlier this year the team believes this policy also applies to noncustodial wallets (though they said they would not comply with it).      Teana Baker-Taylor, a London-based compliance expert and director of crypto industry group Global Digital Finance, said this policy could force all crypto wallet providers in the European Union to collect know-your-customer information from users.      In reference to cryptocurrency exchanges and custodial wallets, she said they will become ""obliged entities,"" similar to banks and other brokerage service providers.      ""AMLD5 prohibits facilitated (non peer-to-peer) anonymous transactions,"" Baker-Taylor told CoinDesk. ""Custodian wallet providers and exchanges will be obligated to implement customer due diligence (including KYC) and transaction monitoring. They will also be required to maintain comprehensive records and report suspicious transactions.""      Speaking broadly in June to the need for more regulation in the global cryptocurrency industry, Steven Maijoor of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said it’s “important to have risk warnings [and] risk information for consumers going into those products” – including anti-money-laundering procedures and arrangements.      When asked how specifically that policy should apply Maijoor said deferred to the expertise of the European Banking Authority.

42431285,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1PJh,1576260000,It's Time to Walk-the-Talk on Decentralized Governance,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Jake Yocom-Piatt is the project lead for Decred, an ""autonomous digital currency.""      In 2019, governance proved essential to moving decentralized communities forward. Open, accountable decision-making (encapsulated by voting and transparency) avoids some of the mistakes of the ICO run-up when governance was more buzzword than a creed startups lived by.      The words “governance, voting, transparency” are still bandied around loosely at conferences, minimizing their absolute importance to the sustainability of the blockchain industry.      Still, a renewed focus on these topics in 2019 has been positive and healthy for the industry, even though there is a ways to go next year as we work on how we talk about governance and how to implement it. In 2019, there were notable governance successes and notable governance failures.      Code Is Law    Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology stem from computer scientists deciding that math and code, instead of rules made by a centralized authority such as bankers or governments, should be the new basis for sending and receiving money.      Over the past year, more crypto projects have rejected the notion of one centralized leader or CEO calling all the shots and absconding to a secret boardroom to push forward initiatives without consulting the stakeholders involved.      The time has come, they say, to move past the backroom wheeling and dealing – a hegemon calling all the shots, or a corrupt small group protecting special interests. DevCon, the ethereum conference in October, proved that crypto people (entrepreneurs, coders, users) want equal governance as an active goal of crypto projects. Cryptocurrency users are looking for projects that give them a direct say.      There are big successes this year. MolochDAO proved that direct developer funding is possible. StakerDAO emerged as a new DAO for investing in existing PoS blockchains. Decred marked one year of Politeia — its off-chain blockchain-anchored proposal that allows stakeholders to vote on development and treasury decisions.      The crypto governance experiment entered its fifth year in 2019, with notable projects making long-term commitments to governance including Dash, AragonOne, and Tezos.      But even these established projects with significant governance infrastructure have yet to fully evolve into a truly autonomously governed entity known as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization.    Paying lip-service to governance, without actually including community members in decisions, simply won’t cut it in the long-term.    Some live the spirit of distributed and transparent governance more faithfully than others. Some groups present themselves as DAOs and don’t follow through on the all the principles.      Paying lip-service to governance, without actually including community members in decisions, simply won’t cut it in the long-term. Projects pretending to be DAOs will eventually lose their users and developers, splintering into the ether as bag-holders cash out.      At the same time we had all these governance initiatives, 2019 was the year of one of the biggest governance failures in history, with $4 billion dollar blockchain EOS degenerating into a special-interests controlled oligarchy of block producers voting themselves into power for short-term profiteering.      The lesson that this mixed governance bag teaches us is that constitutions, no matter how elegantly laid out, fail if participation incentives don’t align to support the stakeholders involved. For the majority of projects with governance features, the incentives alignment nut was not fully cracked in 2019.    Prospects for 2020    2020 is the year projects built for the long-term will rise up from the fold. Since starting Decred in early-2016, we’ve learned sustainable funding and carefully aligned incentives for participation are essential to functional governance.      Governance that lasts is a long-haul play, and it’s much easier to start with good incentives than to change them, or add to them later. When special interests play the short-term game, they decide what’s best for them without regard to token holders, and this erodes not only trust but also valuation in the end.      In 2020, governance must evolve into active forums for decision-making with robust voting participation to include community members.      Real governance requires leadership passing the reins to the community, and leadership actively giving up the reins. Truly decentralized governance needs to take input from all stakeholders involved, which requires strong personalities to share the podium. For that reason, one of Decred’s goals in 2020 is to continue engineering away my authority to remove the possibility of a single point of failure, and it should be a goal of other decentralized projects as well.      A discussion forum alone isn’t enough – stakeholders also need an open system for proposing and voting on decisions. Incentives need to be structured around “skin in the game,” so any person involved in the decision-making process acts with what they think is best for the long-term direction of the project in mind, not just oracles or experts. Direct say in how funds are spent, what upgrades are key, and how to carry this out, should come from all parts of the community. When token-holders have a direct say and a cost to their decisions, they’re incentivized to participate and contribute.    Beyond Just Discussion    Crypto governance is about to take a spin towards direct sovereignty, where a variety of participants can join in. Unfortunately, staking minimums are often too high to encourage all-comers to participate. In 2020, more projects will need to tackle this by lowering the barriers to entry if they want to walk-the-talk and provide everyone with a voice in the process.      Next year, as more and more people seek ideas driven by the collective intelligence of the community, we’ll see more DAOs established and more attempts. With the right governance, cryptocurrencies can become digitally sovereign states, replacing both traditional governments and banks in the transfer of value. Decentralized governance holds the promise of direct stakeholder sovereignty in a more fair, private, and free financial system, and it’s about to heat up in 2020.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Jake Yocom-Piatt,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/13/its-time-to-walk-the-talk-on-decentralized-governance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d1b9c3ee674d51780c824c014c6028684ddcfe61-799x533.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374491,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZzqV,1576258123,‘Request for Exhumation’: QuadrigaCX Creditors Ask for Proof That Cotten Is Dead,"A law firm representing users of the now-defunct crypto exchange QuadrigaCX wants investigators to exhume the body of its former CEO.  A letter sent by law firm Miller Thomson to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) asks for the authorities to dig up and examine the body of Gerald Cotten, who reportedly died of complications due to Crohn’s disease at the end of December 2018. Cotten was 30 at the time.  “The purpose of this letter is to request, on behalf of the Affected Users, that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (the ‘RCMP’), conduct an exhumation and post-mortem autopsy on the body of Gerald Cotten to confirm both its identity and the cause of death given the questionable circumstances surrounding Mr. Cotten’s death and the significant losses of Affected Users,” the letter reads.  Cotten’s death was kept secret for a month after his passing, with the exchange accepting deposits but not allowing at least some customers to withdraw funds throughout that time.  Shortly after Cotten’s death was announced on the QuadrigaCX website by his widow Jennifer Robertson, the exchange went offline, filing for creditor protection and announcing that Cotten was the only individual who knew the private keys to the exchange’s cold wallets, and therefore had been the only person who could access its crypto holdings.  However, an investigation by Quadriga’s court-appointed monitor, Ernst & Young, revealed that the exchange’s crypto wallets were empty, with most of the crypto holdings transferred to other exchanges and wallets.  It was later revealed that Cotten had likely used at least some of the crypto taken from Quadriga to margin trade small-cap alternative cryptocurrencies.  Lingering suspicions  Cotten’s death has been under suspicion since it was announced. According to Robertson’s statement, he had died of complications from Crohn’s disease, which is not generally fatal.  Robertson's attorney, Stewert McKelvey partner Richard Niedermayer, told CoinDesk in a statement that she was ""heartbroken to learn of this request.""  ""Gerry died on December 9, 2018 in India – an independent investigation by the Globe & Mail confirmed this earlier this year, and it should not be in doubt. While Ms. Robertson has assisted the Quadriga Affected Users in the recovery of assets, and has cooperated fully with Ernst & Young’s investigation, it is not clear how the exhumation or an autopsy to confirm the cause of Gerry’s death from complications arising from his Crohn’s disease would assist the asset recovery process further,"" the statement said.  A death certificate obtained by CoinDesk from the Indian hospital Cotten reportedly died in misspelled his name, and a doctor who examined Cotten later told Vanity Fair that the actual cause of death – as well as the circumstances around it – remain unclear.  Following his death, Cotten was embalmed in a medical school and transported back to Canada, where he was reportedly buried in mid-December.  “Enclosed please find a detailed compilation (the ‘Background Material’, at Schedule ‘A’) of publicly available information on the history of Quadriga, Gerald Cotten and others related to Quadriga which, in our view, further highlight the need for certainty around the question of whether Mr. Cotten is in fact deceased,” Friday’s letter said.  The background material was not shared. An associate with the law firm told CoinDesk that the firm does ""not intend to share this attorney work product publicly.""  “Representative Counsel respectfully requests that this process be completed by Spring of 2020, given decomposition concerns,” the letter states.

Levine:      On Today’s episode, we’re talking Tokens for Mongolian Taxi Fares, Bitmain’s Texas Hedge, and one startups existential offer to dissolve itself      Adam B. Levine: It’s December 13th, 2019, and you’re listening to Markets Daily, I’m Adam B. Levine, editor of Podcasts here At Coindesk, along with our senior markets reporter, Brad Keoun, to give you a concise daily briefing on crypto markets and some of the most important news developments in the sector over the past 24 hours.      Markets Update (Illegal ICO, Mongolian Taxi Token)      Bitcoin up just slightly, after four straight days of declines      Currently around $7200 and CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports that today’s move up has been pretty lackluster, an indication that sentiment is still quite bearish      That said, bitcoin is still more than double where it started the year, and that performance has helped make cryptocurrencies the best-performing asset class of the year, dwarfing gains from U.S. Treasuries, emerging markets, gold, oil and even U.S. stocks, which have been charting new records as U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration reportedly moves toward agreement with China of the trade war between the world’s two largest economies      Turning to the news, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said yesterday that it was her personal conviction that she wants to be QUOTE ahead of the curve END-QUOTE on the issue of stablecoins, amid efforts by Facebook’s Libra and other countries to develop payment tokens backed by government currencies      There is clearly a demand that the ECB needs to respond to, she said.      CoinDesk’s Nathan DiCamillo reports that Kraken, the San Francisco-based crypto exchange, appears to be preparing to open a limited-purpose bank in Wyoming that would let it store customers’ deposits of government-issued currencies like dollars and euros      The cryptocurrency exchange has opened up a position for an operations director to oversee a Wyoming special-purpose depository institution.      The move could take advantage of Wyoming’s new blockchain-industry friendly laws, which according to state officials could allow companies to operate in New York without having to obtain that state’s notoriously strict BitLicense      CoinDesk’s Anna Baydakova reports that Hydra, Russia’s largest darknet market, is seeking to raise $146 million through a token sale to fund a worldwide expansion      Now this is essentially like a Craig’s list of things that might be illegal, similar to the Silk Road marketplace in the early days of the crypto industry, with offerings ranging from Colombian cocaine to peruvian cocaine, home-grown marijuana, fake passports, hacking services, prescription pills and synthetic drugs      The Hydra project promises almost complete anonymity, with no adherence to the know-your-customer standards that most banks and exchanges must follow for anti-money-laundering compliance, along with an encrypted messaging system, a crypto exchange and an anonymous browser      Needless to say the whole endeavor would appear to be an illegal ICO under the laws of most nations. The ICO is scheduled to launch next week and could prove a test case of whether the anything-goes spirit of the offering can succeed in an era of increasing regulation and institutionalization in the crypto industry      And with the crypto market stuck in a funk as we head into the last few weeks of the year, there’s more job cutbacks in the industry following the news yesterday of reductions at the crypto-focused firms Circle and Consensys      CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reports that Trustology, a digital-asset custodian, has cut seven staffers, reducing its total headcount to just 11. CEO Alex Batlin says the company needed to restructure and downsize      Finally, there’s a new use case for blockchain and cryptocurrencies - in the Mongolian taxi industry      CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson reports that the blockchain Terra will serve as a financial backbone on a Mongolian messaging app, allowing users to make payments over the system      One taxi driver told Nelson that he’s already been paying for gas with the tokens he’s receiving from riders      SPONSORED BY Consensus2020.com    Hey folks, Adam B.

Adam: And for todays featured story, Bitmain is still the market leader in crypto mining equipment. But its top position is being threatened by some stiff competition. Earlier this week — as reported by CoinDesk’s Wolfie Zhao — Bitmain announced they will offer customers a few incentives to get them to buy new machines. One of those is a bunch of put options.      So what are these put options and what makes them so unusual? We’re talking right now with Lawrence Lewitinn. He’s managing editor of Markets at CoinDesk and he just wrote a story about Bitmain’s options offer. So what makes Bitmain’s offer so interesting? And what's this about a Texas hedge?      Lawrence Lewitinn: So they're doing what's called writing a put. Writing a put is essentially what you would call selling a put, and when you're selling a put you inherently long the underlying instruments. So, by selling Bitmain is hoping the price of Bitcoin goes up. It's part of being an options rider, expecting the price of the underlying instrument to rise.      Now the thing about Bitmain, first of all, their revenues come from selling mining equipment and it is very related to the price of bitcoin. That means if the price of bitcoin collapses tomorrow, the demand for their machines falls apart.      On top of that, they have a considerable amount of cryptocurrency in their own portfolio. They had hundreds of millions of dollars worth when they filed an S1, which is kind of a financial statement that they were filing when they were considering going public. They show that they had hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies. By writing a put on top of all of that, they're doubling down on their long Bitcoin position.      Adam: So what’s a Texas hedge?      Lawrence: It's kind of a joke term among options traders. When I was a trader back in the nineties, we used to use that term. What a Texas hedge is, essentially, most people would use options to hedge their position. So, if you're long bitcoin, you would buy the put to protect your downside. But in case of a Texas hedge, you would sell the put and by Bitcoin, so you're doubling down on your position. That's kind of what it looks like Bitmain is doing.      Adam: What are some of the ways that Bitmain could offset their risks. And do we know if they did?  So this is interesting. I went in and looked around various options exchanges to see where the 5000 strike bitcoin puts that will expire in March. Where are they trading? They didn't seem out of line and didn't look like a lot of purchases were happening. So if Bitmain really were 100% fully hedged, you would probably see an uptick in the options market with them buying those low strike price puts in the market just to say “Okay, you know, we'll buy them, we'll give it to our customers.” They did it early on Monday.      If you look in the market, it's trading a little shy of 200. So conceivably they would go out and buy it for 200. And you know, they said, oh is worth $255. But we bought it for $200 we're giving it to you. Didn't look like they did that. That doesn't mean they didn't do it, but nonetheless, there's no evidence of it in the market. It's still quite a statement for them to say We're going to give you all these puts. We're going to write all these puts and give it to our customers. We're really going gung-ho for the price of bitcoin to go up. That's how much faith we have in our equipment and you as a customer and bitcoin in general. But of course, it could also just be being a cowboy, a Texas hedge here, we won't know for sure, but all remains to be seen. So, this is going to be a very interesting three months, for Bitmain. It won't be the biggest marketing expense, but if you think about it, if they sold 500,000 units right now over the next few days or few weeks using this incentive program at the present time they would probably have to sell about 3700 bitcoin just to be what they call Delta neutral, which is no exposure in the market. That's quite a lot of bitcoin, close to $26 million worth. But it looks like that's not a big chunk out of their Bitcoin holdings. Nonetheless, $26 million is nothing to sneeze at.      Altcoin Spotlight      Adam: And now, for our altcoin spotlight, we’re looking at a new proposal from a startup called DigixDAO (DIDGE-EX-DAO), which appears to put holders of its three-year-old digital tokens ahead of its own survival      For today’s feature, we’re going to highlight some exclusive reporting by CoinDesk’s Brady Dale on what appears to be a very interesting development with one of the smaller tokens in the crypto space      Brad: The story is about DigixDAO, which is essentially offering to dissolve itself in what appears to be a uniquely selfless gesture to put its stakeholders first      Digix is a project that holds physical gold and represents it with tokens on the ethereum blockchain via its DGX token      But the company also has a separate token DGD, sold in 2016, that entitles holders to what are more akin to ownership rights in the company      Dale reports that Digix has some $56 million of the cryptocurrency ether in its corporate treasury      And that amount is far higher than the current market capitalization of the tokens, currently around $37 million      So the idea is that the whole enterprise could be dissolved, and token holders might see immediate profits rather than waiting for Digix’s gold-back tokens to take off      Now the price of these tokens has surged since the new dissolution proposal was announced in late November      It’s essentially as if a stock corporation had more cash in its bank account than was represented in the share price, and the company simply closed up shop and distributed all the cash to its shareholders      Indeed, some industry observers told Dale that the crypto industry is ripe for such corporate moves, and even that it might need an activist investor along the lines of the corporate raider Carl Icahn to force some crypto startups to put stakeholders first, even if it means the founders and employees lose their jobs and have to start over      Ryan Zurrer of the Swiss crypto-asset firm Dialectic told Dale that many of the best known ICOs that ran sales prior to the peak of the bull market in 2017 are sitting on vast resources, since those projects were essentially capitalized with crypto tokens like ether whose value has appreciated faster than the underlying company’s development      Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures says he sees the move by Digix as “quite mature”      In a statement to CoinDesk, Digix(DIDGE-EX) noted that it had encouraged stakeholders not to wind down DigixDAO(DIDGE-EX-DAO), but that it would abide by their decision and would abstain from voting its own holdings of the DGD tokens      Digix Chief Operating Officer Shaun Djie said in the statement, that QUOTE it is important for the success of the industry that these communities continue to be heard. END-QUOTE      The episode demonstrates that despite some mainstream perceptions of the crypto industry as being full of opportunists and fraudsters, some operators are putting corporate governance first - not to mention their own stakeholders      And that’s something that, based on Carl Icahn’s fertile career as a corporate raider and an active investor, isn’t always a priority for executives and founders in traditional stock markets      Brad: BACK TO YOU ADAM      Adam: Join us again on Monday, for the next Daily Markets from Coindesk.

42431294,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1PXh,1576252800,Can 'Dogfooding' Altcoins Find Real Users in 2020?,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Leigh Cuen is a reporter with CoinDesk. These are her personal views.      If 2017 was the token boom and late-2018 was a crypto winter, then 2019 was the year of “dogfooding,” or ""using your own product.""      Throughout 2019, leaders from more than a dozen leading crypto projects told me they were distributing tokens to stimulate usage, development, and growth. Which raises the question: If companies are giving tokens away, do they have a legitimate business with organic demand? So far, it appears there’s more supply than take-up for many altcoins.      As a reporter, I can sympathize that the crypto industry is still struggling to find a target audience beyond speculation-driven traders. In some ways, airdrops are reminiscent of how newspapers sometimes boost their circulation by dumping free copies into the hands of commuters. Sure they've distributed more papers, but to what gain?      Just to list one example of token hopium announcements from 2019: Ripple’s investment arm Xpring gave over 1 billion XRP tokens in a bid to foster a community of “creators, consumers and strategic partners.”      It’s these sort of moves that inspire blockchain consultant Maya Zehavi to define dogfooding as “when an organization uses its funds to eat its own product,” or when “when investors double down to fund projects that build on a protocol in their portfolio.”      ""It reeks to me of desperation,” Blockstream engineer Warren Togami said of token incentives. “Marketing didn't work, so instead they're throwing money at the problem assuming competent developers and use cases that make sense will magically appear."" He thinks dogfooding is more successful when it isn’t strictly reliant on monetary incentives.      “What I've seen with both Linux from the late 90s and early 2000s, and Bitcoin, is the top developers are those who were passionate about working on it before money was offered. They cared most about the problems they were trying to solve,” he said.    Free or open source software projects, including Linux and Bitcoin Core operated according to different principles than simply giving tokens away, Togami, Red Hat alumnus and open source greybeardhttp://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story=20061103073628401, said.    “Bitcoin had only volunteers for years, then more recently people working full time sponsored by companies, but with independence to do whatever is the right thing to for bitcoin,"" Togami said speaking of Square Crypto, Chaincode Labs, DG Lab, Blockstream, and several others.      Other projects like the Neo Foundation operate a circle of companies using its technology and assets (formerly Antshares). The projects all rely on NEO. Meanwhile, horizontally-integrated projects like the ethereum-centric ConsenSys mesh dominate the broader cryptocurrency industry.    Shake my hand, I'll shake yours    Few projects are relying on developers to “dogfood” new software quite like Handshake, a project spearheaded by co-creator of bitcoin’s lightning network, Joseph Poon, Purse CEO Andrew Lee, and Private Internet Access founder Andrew Lee, just to name a few.      Handshake was in development throughout 2019 and is expected to launch a mainnet in 2020.      Today, certificate authorities like GoDaddy dominate the market for buying and proving ownership of website domains. Handshake believes it can reduce the power of such centralized authorities while helping us evade government censorship.      The plan is to airdrop roughly $100 million worth of Handshake tokens at launch to thousands of developers with active GitHub accounts. Meanwhile, Coinbase is considering listing Handshake tokens on its exchange.      Investor and contributing developer Steven McKie, founding partner of the venture firm Amentum and co-founder of the independent Handshake Alliance consortium, told CoinDesk this strategy will accelerate the decentralization of Handshake’s blockchain network.    A token can only incentivize someone who wants it.    “We all have a for-profit incentive...to build the infrastructure,” McKie said, referring to exchanges and freelance developers who will receive the airdrop. “We can all bring in our different skill-sets and networks to make this thing whole, widespread on the first day.”      Primitive Ventures co-founder Eric Meltzer told CoinDesk his firm will run a Handshake node at launch. New startups such as the crypto exchange Namebase.io and the developer tools startup Urkel both plan to launch alongside the Handshake mainnet. VC firms like A16z Crypto, Polychain Capital and Draper Associates have all invested in the project.      But it’s questionable if there’s organic demand for the product among developers with the skills to develop protocols related to the internet’s core infrastructure. A token can only incentivize someone who wants it. Farsight Security CTO Ben April, who specializes in security solutions at the startup spearheaded by DNS (Domain Name System) co-creator Paul Vixie, said he’s not optimistic about Handshake because it doesn’t address surveillance of a censored website’s traffic.      “There’s a historical pattern where a new technology comes along and someone says I can apply this to DNS,” April told CoinDesk. “DNS is the wrong technology for [censorship resistance] ...If I’m able to watch the network you’re on, I’m able to see you are getting there anyway.”      April doesn’t see much need for Handshake. Certificate authorities are already pretty diverse and open source efforts led by groups like the Internet Engineering Task Force are slowly addressing security concerns without any tokens or extra work maintaining a duplicate namespace. He thinks the process is already more decentralized than Handshake can offer in the short-term, and, even in the long-term, he doubts the benefits of Handshake would outweigh the hassle.      A token can’t create value, although it might help facilitate interactions on a network if players were to already believe it has value.      “Re-factoring everything I’m doing to a new model would require that the new model be clearly, head and shoulders, more valuable than what I have today,” April said. “I need to see critical mass.”    Looking forward    Requiring “critical mass” to succeed is precisely the challenge underlying the search for “mainstream adoption.”      It did not come in 2019, and I would be surprised if the Blockchain Fairy Godmother suddenly plops it on our doorstep in 2020. That’s why ConsenSys engineer Shayan Eskandari is talking to the incumbent nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) about Handshake and other groups associated with core internet protocols.      Although CoreDNS contributor Michael Grosser, founder of the DNS provider GitNS.com, agreed with April that Handshake doesn’t offer full stack censorship resistance, he was more optimistic about the Handshake Foundation offering an alternative to ICANN. Community building takes time.      Applying that insight more broadly, the few crypto companies that didn’t collapse or struggle have conservative strategies focused on research and development, such as Tendermint. They aren’t reliant on tokens. They view blockchain technology as a prospective alternative, not as an immediate source of revenue or public infrastructure replacement.      There is perhaps no system on the planet that exemplifies Zehavi’s above-mentioned variety of dogfooding better than ethereum.      Ethereum cofounders like Joe Lubin (of ConsenSys) and Vitalik Buterin have poured their wealth into a thousand ideas aiming to incentivize both ethereum development and “decentralized finance” (DeFi) experiments, including MKR tokens.      This strategy has become the envy of altcoiners everywhere. Placeholder’s Chris Burniske and Electric Capital co-founder Avichal Garg both praised this method when discussing their visions for the future of the privacy coin zcash. But it remains to be seen if this new type of dogfooding, arguably a bastardization of the original term, works in the long term.      This is still a matter of fierce debate within the industry.      Bitcoin researcher and engineer Jeremy Rubin tweeted in May 2019 that blockchain enthusiasts need to come up with better ways to fund their work. Blockstream’s Togami retorted that merely being an open source project doesn’t mean the team is entitled to funding, especially not via tokens traded by retail users. The technology still needs to make sense and solve a problem.      As it stands, Togami said 2019 continued to show him that token incentivizes are “perhaps not the best way to attract top talent” for such problem-solving.

42431284,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1PDh,1576251000,New York Attorney General Calls Bitfinex's Legal Stance 'Deeply Perverse' in New Filing,"The New York Attorney General's office has laid out in greater detail its case for investigating Bitfinex and Tether.      A New York Supreme Court Appellate Division filing published Thursday and dated Dec. 4 fleshes out the NYAG's argument, claiming that the two sister firms had gradually been depleting the reserves backing Tether's eponymous stablecoin, also known as USDT.      In a sharply worded brief, the office said that the two firms (which share executives and shareholders) “had, step by step, dissipated the cash backing tethers: first by going from actual cash in hand to $625 million in an inaccessible Crypto Capital account; and then by replacing even that questionable source of backing with nothing more than a $625 million IOU from Bitfinex.”      That debt, said the NYAG, “seemed unlikely to be repaid,” as Bitfinex required the funds for withdrawals on its exchange.      In a post on its website Friday, which came following the publication of this article, Tether took issue with this argument, among others, writing that the brief ""offers a highly misleading factual presentation. It describes the fully secured loan on commercially reasonable terms as nothing more than an IOU from Bitfinex 'that seemed unlikely to be repaid,' conveniently omitting the fact that Bitinex repaid $100M of that loan months ago, ahead of schedule, and with interest.""      As reported, in the spring of 2019, Tether changed a statement on its website indicating that USDT was backed 100 percent by U.S. dollars. It later acknowledged in court that tether was backed only by “cash and cash equivalents … representing approximately 74 percent of the current outstanding tethers.”      The firm claimed again in November, that, at that point, all USDT tokens were “fully backed by reserves,” not specifying the assets acting as collateral.      The new NYAG filing further suggested that Bitfinex’s exchange token LEO, issued in the early summer, could be a security under U.S. law.      “While the motion to dismiss was pending, respondents conducted yet another large financial transaction, issuing nearly one billion ‘LEOs,’ a new virtual asset resembling a debt security,” the NYAG said.      Tether's post said U.S. buyers were barred from buying LEO tokens (though several U.S. residents purchased tokens on secondary markets) and called ""any criticism of our 'tactics' in this case ... baseless,"" saying the companies approached the NYAG in ""good faith.""      The Supreme Court has previously found that the exchange “knowingly permitted New York-based traders to use Bitfinex” until at least 2018, despite officially banning customers there a year earlier, putting it under the state's jurisdiction. The NYAG further alleges in the new filingthat a Bitfinex executive “assisted New York customers with trading activity.”      The NYAG took aim at Bitfinex’s actions around the court case as well, writing that the firm’s arguments that “fault OAG for having insufficient evidence about tether’s status as a security or commodity and about respondents’ contacts with New York” are “deeply perverse,” as the companies have “persistently refused” to produce the documents which NYAG believes answers these questions.    Making a stand    The NYAG filing comes in response to Bitfinex and Tether’s ongoing appeal over an inquiry begun earlier this year. According to the New York State electronic filing system, the crypto companies filed a brief on Nov. 4, claiming that the NYAG does not have jurisdiction over any of the affiliated entities, and neither does the New York court trying the case.      Bitfinex’s lawyers said the New York State Supreme Court, which is trying the inquiry, made three rulings which it should not have: that the NYAG did not have to personally serve the company’s executives with the order outlining the inquiry (the order was instead delivered to counsel); that NYAG has jurisdiction over Bitfinex and Tether; and that the supreme court can try the case without determining whether tethers are securities or commodities.      Bitfinex is asking the appellate court to reverse each of these decisions.      The companies maintain that New York residents cannot use Bitfinex or Tether, and have not been able to do so since January 2017.      Regarding the change in language on Tether’s website around USDT’s dollar backing, the filing stated: “For whatever alleged ‘criticism’ the change engendered, however, the markets remained confident in tether, as it continued to trade at par or better.”      The case began in late April when the NYAG began its inquiry, alleging Bitfinex covered up the loss of close to $1 billion held by a payment processor, Crypto Capital. Crypto Capital’s executives were later indicted and some were arrested for running a “shadow banking” service for cryptocurrency exchanges and other companies.      The NYAG claims that Tether, despite previously claiming that every USDT token was backed on a 1:1 basis, had been lending Bitfinex funds to cover up the loss of $850 million. While the New York State Supreme Court ruled that Bitfinex and Tether should turn over specific documents about the financial arrangements made regarding a loan from Tether to Bitfinex, the ruling was paused pending the current appeal.      The parties are expected to make their arguments face to face in court sometime early next year.      UPDATE (Dec. 13, 2019 21:40 UTC): Bitfinex filed a reply Friday, maintaining its previous arguments that the NYAG's office does not have jurisdiction over the exchange or its sister firm Tether. The filing also maintains that the New York Supreme Court similarly does not have jurisdiction over the companies, claiming that they do not operate within the state. This article was later updated with comments posted to Tether's website.",NEGATIVE,USDT | LEO,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT | LEO,"Daniel Palmer, Nikhilesh De",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/12/13/new-york-attorney-general-calls-bitfinexs-legal-stance-deeply-perverse-in-new-filing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e78b79f0171f52339105e9b26e02a0622cf49e72-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431287,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1PFh,1576243800,What DeFi Needs Next Year: Three Priorities,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Haseeb Qureshi is a managing partner at Dragonfly Capital, a cross-border crypto venture fund.    2019 was a watershed year for DeFi. We saw the number of DeFi users increase by 30x, while the total loans originated via DeFi locked in DeFi more than tripledhttps://loanscan.io/loans?interval=max. MakerDAO, the first and most dominant DeFi player has clinched market share, while platforms like Compound, dYdX, and Uniswap have had their breakout moments. Wallets like Coinbase and Argent are now offering the effective equivalent of dollar-denominated savings accounts, all settled on public blockchains.    Just a year ago, DeFi was an obscure and somewhat speculative concept. Now nobody doubts that DeFi will be integral to public blockchains.      And yet, DeFi is still in its infancy. Most of the products are relatively simple: overcollateralized loans (known traditionally as secured lending) and simple on-chain settled exchanges, like 0x and Uniswap. The collateralization rates are in the neighborhood of 150%, meaning the value of the collateral the borrower needs to put up is 50% larger than the value of the loan.      This is a good start, but we’ve got a long way to go.      Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine often claims that crypto is replaying the history of modern finance, but in an alternate and sped-up timeline. If that’s true, then DeFi today is analogous to Venetian banking in the middle ages, when banking as we think of it today was just getting started. In a bustling port city like Venice, there were few long-standing reputations, and many interactions were one-shot games. There wasn’t a lot of room for identity and building up credit. In that context, you generally needed collateral and wide margins of security for a loan.      That’s where we sit today in DeFi: everything is overcollateralized, and your lenders know absolutely nothing about you. Any data, reputation, or iterated games are completely ignored by these protocols.    DeFi introduces what was missing: a truly internet-native form of finance.    So what comes next?DeFi has a lot to improve on, but here are top three priorities for 2020.      The first is to increase efficiency by driving down overcollateralization margins. Most consumer mortgages operate on a 5-20% downpayment, making the total loan collateralization at 105-120% (since the house itself is already 100% collateral). 150% overcollateralization would be unheard of anywhere in normal finance.      Why are collateralization rates so large? There are two main reasons for this: volatility and latency.      Because volatile crypto is used as collateral, lenders need to protect themselves against a sudden drop in collateral value. It’s possible that crypto matures and becomes less volatile over time. But even without that, you can decrease volatility by onboarding more stable collateral, such as stablecoins, gold-pegged coins, or digital securities.      The more worrying issue is latency: if you see the collateral drop in value, how quickly can you liquidate the loan to ensure you don’t end up in the red against the borrower? After all, if a DeFi borrower’s equity has gone negative, you can’t claw back money from them—on the blockchain, they’d just abandon their address.      In this case, the latency of the underlying blockchain matters quite a lot. If you can decrease block times in Proof of Stake (or better yet, push DeFi applications to layer 2), and use a more professionalized network of keepers or market makers, these systems would be able to liquidate collateral much faster. This would allow them to bring their collateralization ratios closer to rates we see in traditional finance. That 50% margin is so large mainly because it’s currently plausible to have your collateral drop by 33% in value before the system can liquidate your position! With faster liquidations and more solid collateral, that overcollateralization ratio can drop by quite a bit.      After driving down collateralization rates, the second priority for DeFi is greater diversity of synthetic assets. Look at MakerDAO: MakerDAO produces dai, a synthetic dollar-pegged stablecoin, with no actual dollars being held anywhere in the system. All requires is an ETH/USD price feed. If we just swap out that price feed for ETH/gold instead, suddenly we can produce a synthetic gold-pegged token through the exact same mechanics. Maker and UMA are two protocols that are pursuing this, and I expect we’ll soon see a wide array of synthetic financial assets. In the future, anyone with a mobile phone will be able to buy whatever financial asset they want from anywhere in the world, all mediated by crypto.      Finally, DeFi will need to migrate toward iterated games. Instead of treating every user as a blank slate, protocols will take account of your long-standing on-chain cash-flows and revenue-producing assets. If your address has behaved well on other DeFi platforms, you should be eligible for lower rates and better credit.      Eventually, we should be able to import robust forms of identity onto the blockchain by building bridges with the real world.      Identity is a prerequisite here. After all, when it comes to lending, blockchains are not quite like the real world. If you default on your debts in real life, you must declare bankruptcy and surrender your credit for at least seven years. But on the blockchain, you can just abandon any address that’s defaulted and start over with a new address, no harm no foul. It’s impossible to force somebody into the red when they can just generate a new address for free. It’d be like letting people change their names and start over on their credit scores after declaring bankruptcy.      So we need stable, costly identity. But if we wait for governments and other identity brokers to provide this service, we might be waiting forever. More likely, as Balaji Srinivasan advocates, we’ll build bridges between a person’s blockchain and Web2 identity, which can be done without any governments getting involved. If I can use my Twitter or Facebook reputation to backstop my credit history on the blockchain, then we can build a purely digital credit system. There are a lot of unsolved problems here when it comes to privacy and k-anonymity, but in principle it should be doable.      The Internet disrupted monopolies in almost every industry, but somehow it left finance mostly untouched. DeFi introduces what was missing: a truly internet-native form of finance. Eventually, it will do to finance what the Internet did to every other industry. But it’s still early, all of these products are experimental, and there will undoubtedly be failures. But the power of permissionless innovation makes DeFi all but inevitable.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MKR | TRADING | ZRX,Haseeb Qureshi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/13/what-defi-needs-next-year-three-priorities,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/79bfd2a0e78fd8f476db591cd855540d00803541-1000x672.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431279,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1P3h,1576240206,'New Risks': Swiss Government Skeptical on Central Bank Digital Currency,"A digital Swiss franc would do more harm than good, according to the nation's government.      Having been requested by the Swiss parliament to examine the potential of creating a central bank digital currency (CBDC), the government concluded that it would bring risks of financial stability, Reuters reports on Friday.      In a statement following a cabinet meeting, the government said: “Universally accessible central bank digital currency would bring no additional benefits for Switzerland at present. Instead, it would give rise to new risks, especially with regard to financial stability.”      Other nations' central banks are already actively researching the potential of CBDCs with China recently reported to be planning trials of its digital yuan starting early next year. Sweden too, plans to issue its CBDC in the near to medium term, the government said in the report.      And while digital currencies are touted as having potential to improve payments and strengthen monetary policy while helping reduce financial crime, the cabinet said the real-world benefits may not meet expectations. Further, the negative repercussions of an e-franc could be extensive.      However, the government did say that a role for a digital franc that was confined to use among financial institutions is ""a more promising strategy.""      “This would not have the same far-reaching and fundamental implications as universally accessible central bank digital currency,"" the cabinet said. A wholesale digital franc from the central bank ""could possibly help to enhance efficiency in the trading, settlement and management of securities.”      Incoming European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said on Thursday said her institution should be “ahead of the curve” when it comes to CBDCs, as per another Reuters report.      However, before addressing any technical aspects, the ECB needs to be clear on the objectives of a digital euro, she said.      The Swiss government has taken a relatively cryptocurrency and blockchain-friendly stance in recent years, with its canton of Zug dubbed ""Crypto Valley"" due to the large number of industry startups that have made it their home.

Anthony Pompliano is the co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital.      Anthony ""Pomp"" Pompliano is one of bitcoin’s biggest boosters. His Twitter feed is a hurricane of crypto-news, self-promotion and inspirational quotes for hodlers of heavy bags. He ends every week with a summary of bitcoin’s biggest accomplishments, always including the un-ironically cheerful: “bitcoin still not dead.”      This past year, Pomp served as crypto’s ambassador to traditional finance in appearances on CNBC’s Squawk Box. He also defended bitcoin against notable skeptic Shark Tank's Kevin O’Leary. Just this week, he called out Mark Cuban for saying bitcoin has “no chance.”      Pomp’s playing the long game. Not only will bitcoin survive, but it will become the world’s reserve currency, he believes (optimistically).      CoinDesk caught up with Pompliano to discuss the year in crypto, how to strike successful investments, and the ups and downs of being a public figure in crypto.      You’ve been a prominent figure in the space for a while now. In your opinion what were some of the most pivotal moments in crypto for 2019?      If you go back to the beginning of the year, I think the most significant events were the bottoming of the bear market, Libra and the significant advancements made in China. However, I think the most significant advance in crypto was made in institutional adoption, which doesn’t mean institutions like banks coming aboard, but institutions like university endowments, hospital insurance the real asset allocators. They have come in in a material way.      Why are these players coming around to crypto now?      I think there is a separation between blockchain and bitcoin, and they’ve gotten comfortable with blockchain. There’s still discomfort with bitcoin. It’s becoming clear we’ll have an automated world, and in order for that to happen you’ll need digital assets. Blockchain is just the way to keep track, it’s an accounting system. I think that’s why we’ve been successful raising capital. There’s a belief in blockchain fitting into other technology trends that investors are already buying into. This isn't anything different. It is actually just enhancing trends people are already buying into.    There's a stark line in the sand between Libra and bitcoin. That's helpful because it shows the value of bitcoin for people.    Could you spell out how crypto fits into the trend of automation and technological adoption.      For us, it's a foundational component of the technological change taking place. I always joke, we never have anyone come into our office and say ‘Hey, we’re building a Microsoft Excel Company.' If you think about automation of micro-transactions or high frequency transactions between a bunch of connected devices, there's no way current way to keep track of it all. If you need interoperability between systems, these public open source, permissionless ledgers allow you to do that in a really interesting way. Our investment thesis on the technology is just that blockchain will be pervasive, and to get ahead of it now rather than wait 10 years. So it's really flipping it on its head and saying, 'it's not so much about the technology, as it is finding these great companies that happen to use this one piece of technology.'      What was Libra's effect on investment sentiment?      Libra is actually a pretty good idea. From a sentiment standpoint, there's three things. One, it’s forced central banks and regulators around the world to think through their approach to cryptocurrencies. Second, the response in the United States hasn’t been as positive as we would have wished. There’s been a lot of negative backlash, almost like a helicopter parent approach. The third thing is it’s really drawn a stark line in the sand between Libra and bitcoin. I think that's helpful because it shows the value of bitcoin for people, because now they have something to compare it to.      Do you think any of the backlash against Libra is is justified?      I actually think regulators should be less worried about Libra and more worried about digital currencies created by the banks. Facebook will be one of 100 corporations that governs Libra. The only way for a decision to be made in Libra is for multiple corporations, across continents, in different industries, some for-profit some nonprofit, to come together and make a decision. So it’d be really difficult for one player to be nefarious, because your consensus is among all of these players.      Compare that to J. P. Morgan or Wells Fargo to making decisions alone. They're the only ones that are in control. My fear with the banks is they’ll launch a digital currency. It'll be adopted internally to move capital around. It’ll move to their corporate partners. It’ll gain some retail traction. You'll start using it to buy things. Then one day in the future, they’ll just unpeg it from the dollar. They only have to make that decision themselves. I get that people are upset, but the nuances of the structure are more important than just a binary this is good, that is bad.      The Chinese government is also working on its own digital currency. Recently members of the Federal Reserve have come out saying they’re researching a U.S. dollar backed stablecoin. How does this fit into your worldview?      The U.S. today is in a defensive mindset where they're trying to protect the monetary supremacy they have. I just published an article, arguing that the U.S. is suffering from an “innovator's dilemma.” We’ve had it really good for a long time, but when this new technology comes out, if we don't act, it will disrupt us. So the rational thing to do is to create a digital dollar. To do exactly what China is doing, but let it stand for the democratic and capitalistic ideals we hold sacred. I still think that bitcoin ends up winning out over a very long time period.      Do you think bitcoin’s ultimate success is reliant on mass consumer adoption?      It’s like religion. Missionaries go to some far-off land to tell people about this God that they've never heard of before. And once they hear the word of God, they become believers. Maybe. But more likely, we’re going to get to a situation where you need a decentralized, non-censored, non-seizable, non-inflatable, or non-debaseable asset. And when you go looking for it, you'll find bitcoin. I believe bitcoin’s best ally is just time. And as more people get put in situations where it could be valuable to them, they will opt in.      What have you learned from all the time you've been investing in digital assets?      There are three big things. One: This time is not different. All of the traditional investment lessons are true here as well – don't be emotional, have a long time preference, dollar-cost averaging – all of that remains true regardless of the asset. Second, be comfortable with non-consensus opinions. In 2016, 2017 we were public about being negative on the ICO market, and that turned out to be the right bet. Lastly, and this comes from someone who is incredibly bullish, I'm probably underestimating how big this is. That's not specifically true for bitcoin, but for the entire industry. Who would have thought in 1985 that the internet would become what it is today? Even the biggest bulls couldn’t have seen it. I think we generally underestimate what's possible over a long period of time.      Speaking of not seeing things in perspective, was there anything that happened over the past year that completely took you by surprise?      The whole Libra situation in general. That they moved so quickly to announce it. The backlash against them. And two, the institutional adoption. We all thought that it was going to come, but the pace at which a lot of these institutions are coming to bitcoin and blockchain is pretty incredible.      What do we overlook in the media as far as this industry?      It's the issue of human nature, right? Bitcoin is the largest, most volatile, most liquid market with a price attached to it. It's also the longest standing and it represents the ethos of the industry are. A lot of times when people are talking about bitcoin, they use it as a stand-in for the entire industry. There's plenty of other stuff that doesn't get talked about as much as it should. But there's also a lot of other shit that gets talked about that probably shouldn’t.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/13/bitcoins-best-ally-is-just-time-pompliano,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a7db29a6aa0fef4422a4f3d1ee8caec79f9e16d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The three-day chart indicates scope for a deeper drop toward recent lows near $6,500.  A climb to $7,400 cannot be ruled out if the newfound hourly chart resistance at $7,250 is breached with high volumes in the next few hours.  The outlook will remain bearish as long as the lower high at $7,870 is intact.    Bitcoin is again looking weak, having charted a shallow bounce from two-week lows in the last 24 hours.      The cryptocurrency looked to have had potential to jump above $7,300 and possibly extend gains toward $7,500. After all, credible signs of seller exhaustion had emerged on the intraday technical charts following Thursday's drop to $7,072 – the lowest level since Nov. 24.      So far, however, the rebound has been anything but impressive. Bitcoin has faced rejection around $7,250 two times in the last 12 hours and is changing hands at around $7,200 on Bitstamp at press time.      The lackluster bounce indicates sentiment is still quite bearish. In fact, the intraday charts have now rolled back in favor of the sellers. Further, fresh bearish signs have emerged on longer durations, too, indicating scope for a slide to recent lows.    Hourly chart    The ascending channel breakdown seen on the hourly chart indicates the bounce from two-week lows has fizzled out and a fresh drop toward $7,072 and possibly to $7,000 may be in the offing.      The bearish case would strengthen further if the RSI violates the ascending trendline.      A convincing move above $7,250 could propel prices on to $7,400. That said, the outlook will remain bearish as long as prices are trading below the lower high of $7,870 created on Nov. 29.    3-day chart    Bitcoin created a bearish ""outside bar"" candlestick pattern in the three days to Dec. 11. Widely considered a sign of an impending sell-off, these candles occur when the period begins on a positive note but ends with pessimism, engulfing the preceding day's price action.      In BTC's case, the candle indicates the corrective bounce from $6,500 has ended and the bears have regained control. As a result, a fresh sell-off toward $6,500 could be seen.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/13/bitcoin-risks-deeper-drop-after-shallow-price-bounce,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/18fa3fea64e06838f72d844ebaf34db633b6c262-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403654,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgV1c,1576233000,This Token Project Offered to Shut Down. Its Market Cap Shot Up $10M,"The oldest ICOs have treasuries worth more than their tokens’ market capitalizations. Should those projects give some of that money back?      That was the essential question raised by DigixDAO, which is offering its DGD token holders an all-or-nothing option: completely dissolve its treasury or keep making grants to enhance the ecosystem.      Digix CEO Kai Cheng Chng wrote on the DigixDAO blog that Digix has received a lot of feedback since its early-2016 token sale.      ""One recurring comment was for a mechanism for dissatisfied DGD token holders to make a clean break from DigixDAO,"" he wrote.      The post detailed an approach the organization would take henceforth: Token holders will now be able to vote on keeping the DAO's ETH treasury intact. In response, the token price nearly doubled since the announcement came out on Nov. 29. The price was around $13 just before; it's nearing $19 as of this writing.      Which means the market cap went from $27 million to $37 million.      Digix is a project that holds physical gold and represents it with tokens on the ethereum blockchain via its DGX token. The governance token relevant here, however, is DGD, and its current market cap of $39.1 million is significantly below what the 386,000 ETH Chng wrote that DigixDAO has in its treasury. That ETH is currently worth roughly $56 million.      DGD raised 466,648 ETH in the token sale in March 2016, according to Smith + Crown. At the time, the amount raised was worth between $6 million and $7 million. The value of ETH has since gone up significantly.    Wider implications    The DigixDAO decision has prompted discussion across the industry as to whether more projects should follow suit.      ""The space needs a Carl Icahn–like personality to call these teams out and propagate a culture in our industry where it's not OK to just sit on tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars in investor capital,"" Ryan Zurrer, an investor who founded Dialectic, a Swiss-based crypto-asset firm, told CoinDesk.      Zurrer said he’s researched the topic. Many of the best known ICOs that ran sales prior to the peak of the bull market in 2017 are sitting on vast resources as the underlying crypto raised has appreciated significantly since then, he said.      Zurrer would like to see a world where projects delineate clear roadmaps with clear budgets and then explore what he called ""right-sizing"" their treasuries as necessary.      Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures agreed. ""I've been waiting for ICOs with a big balance sheet to do this for a long time,"" he said. ""This is quite mature of Digix I think.""      But Ricky Li of the token trading firm Altonomy didn't see it quite the same way. ""ICOs are not really keen on buying back the tokens with their treasury holdings since they raise money to develop, not speculate on the token price,"" Li said.      And in fact, this squares with Zurrer's observations. Zurrer noted it's not really an all-or-nothing option. A company could redistribute part of its treasury if it has more than it really needs, but continue to do its work. ""A lot of these projects are priced as if this is not going to be the case. As if the price is not correlated to the underlying capital pool at all,"" he said.      Others aren't so sure the move by DigixDAO would be widely replicable.      ""It's hard to generalise on whether this would be a good or bad thing for the space as each situation has its own unique characteristics,"" Mona El-Isa, CEO of Avantgarde Finance, said via WhatsApp. El-Isa's prior company developed the Melonport protocol then turned it over to its community in the form of a DAO.      ""Some of these tokens will become very interesting token-activist opportunities. It’s a little bit surprising that we haven’t seen much of that yet,"" El-Isa said.      Path forward    In a statement to CoinDesk, Digix noted it encouraged the community not to wind down DigixDAO but would abstain from voting its DGD holdings either way.      ""All projects should maintain a strong commitment to staying true to their word to their community – throughout the life cycle of the project,"" Shaun Djie, Digix COO, said. ""The digital asset sector has much to owe to active communities spread across the globe, it is important for the success of the industry that these communities continue to be heard.""      Zurrer told CoinDesk that the projects best suited to go to their holders to discuss unloading some of their capital are the ones that both have valuable treasuries and a decent token governance model.      ""I'm optimistic that 2020 is going to bring a number of this type of situation to the fore,” he said.",NEUTRAL,ETH,ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/12/13/this-token-project-offered-to-shut-down-its-market-cap-shot-up-10m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/157008c73dfbe68bab2c99aa604e945ec388b53f-1500x928.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a press release Thursday, Terra announced its stablecoin issuance protocol would act as Mongolian messaging app memeChat’s new financial backbone. That app, which has attracted 50,000 users since its March launch, now features the Terra-backed memePay payment service as well.      The partnership will let users transact with local merchants, drivers and other users’ digital wallets in Terra MNT stablecoins, tied 1:1 with the Mongolian currency (known as the tugrik). Some merchants have already agreed to use the service, including a taxi company and and a department store.      Terra and memeChat designed the system to need no additional infrastructure, according to the company. Instead, merchants can settle payments in fiat or stablecoin within the memeChat app.      But the growing network of merchants accepting memePay means some businesses will never need to convert to fiat. Uuganbayar B, a driver for the Ulaanbaatar Taxi Company, said that gas stations accept the stablecoins his riders pay him in.      “I find it very useful that I don’t need to worry about having enough cash since I can pay for gas with payments I’ve received,” he said in a statement.

Anthony Francis Faulk faces charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and extortion in the Northern District of California for his alleged plot, in which he is said to have turned the stolen funds into cars, a Rolex watch, a house, royalty rights to songs and diamond-encrusted jewelry, according to court documents.      He allegedly stole the money through a series of SIM-swaps between October 2016 and May 2018.      Faulk and unnamed accomplices took control of at least one victim’s cell phone and attempted to access at least three others’ as well, though it was unclear if these other attempts were successful, the indictment alleges.      SIM-swapping is a well-known threat in the upper echelons of crypto circles, whose members are often targeted because of the higher likelihood that they have lucrative holdings.      Many different internet services – emails, digital wallets, exchange accounts – attempt to provide users additional security through SMS-based two factor authentication. Those services rely on the SIM, the identification system that is effectively an individual’s number.      But relying on text-based two factor authentication is a cybersecurity faux pas. Cell phones were not built to be security apparati, and any number of factors can compromise them outright.      SIM swapping refers to myriad exploitative techniques. In all cases, a successful SIM swap transfers the victim’s cellular identity to the thieves, allowing them to breach associated accounts and change passwords.      A would-be thief could physically steal the victim’s SIM card or bribe telecom employees to become their corporate plants, as is alleged in a separate, unrelated, $1.7 million-dollar lawsuit against AT&T. Malicious actors can also dupe unwitting workers to give them access.      It appears that Faulk and his co-conspirators are alleged to have engaged in the latter. The unsealed indictment against him alleges Faulk used “fraud, deception and social engineering to induce representatives of cell phone service providers” to gain control.      The indictment does not detail how much cryptocurrency Faulk allegedly seized from his victims. Faulk was arrested in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, Wednesday and is out on $250,000 bond. He is scheduled to appear in court on Jan. 9 2020, according to a press release from the Department of Justice.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | SPONSORED,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/13/us-authorities-allege-sim-swapping-thief-bought-music-royalties-jewelry-with-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f5f8c225f1c300406b8d6f309ec85257ec0508a6-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403670,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgVFO,1576202400,Cryptocurrencies Are Still the World's Best Performing Asset Class This Year,"As the year and decade come to an end, cryptocurrencies once again outperform other major asset classes.      Despite trading significantly down from their record highs of late December 2017, large-cap cryptocurrencies had a phenomenal year and remain one of the greatest investment success stories of the decade.      Cementing themselves as the world’s leading asset class for yearly performance, cryptocurrencies have risen well above annualized returns of the U.S. equities, commodities and bond markets for 2019.      Ryan Alfred, President and co-founder of Digital Assets Data said large-cap crypto assets possess significantly higher returns versus traditional markets for this year.      “Looking back at the performance of the top ten large-caps (Bitwise 10) in comparison to other major asset classes, we can see their special signature,” Alfred said.    Crypto versus traditional assets    As seen in the chart above, research provided by Digital Assets Data shows how this year’s performance of the top 10 cryptos by market capitalization fared against other major asset classes such as gold, oil and equities.      Of course, 2019 didn’t start out that way. Back in February, the top 10 crypto began a fairly dismal run, resting well below all other traditional asset classes when viewing their return on investment figures. However, sentiment began to pick up significantly in March and by mid-year, cryptocurrencies were far out ahead of other the other assets.      That gap has begun to narrow as stocks, bonds and commodities begin to increase their lead. Yet cryptocurrencies remain significantly ahead of all other asset classes as the year comes to a close.      Much of this rally is courtesy of bitcoin (BTC). The world's first cryptocurrency is currently up 100 percent since the year began. Meanwhile, Ether, the world’s second-largest crypto is up 35 percent year-to-date, though XRP is down 25 percent from where it traded on Jan. 1.    The big picture: Crypto’s success story    In the year before the decade began, the world was in the throes of a financial crisis. Since then, stocks have rebounded. From its March 2009 market meltdown lows to now, the S&P 500 has gained a respectable 369 percent. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has also had a good run, up 326 percent in that same time period.      However, BTC has blasted those figures, rising well above a staggering 12 million percent (yes, you read that correctly) over a one-year-shorter time frame, beginning March 2010. That’s when the price of 1 BTC was around $0.05, data taken from Messari shows.      Crypto’s success can likely be attributed to its most defining characteristics: high volatility and liquidity, allowing market participants to quickly and easily trade between digital and fiat currencies.
