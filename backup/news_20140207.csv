42425426,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHx7rh,1391813123,"Apple Sours on Bitcoin, Corner Shop Conundrum, and the Stolen Good","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 7th February 2014 – a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder.      Your host … John Law.    Apple makes fans close wallets  There is nothing like a holy war to get the pulse going, and there’s no holy war as satisfying to watch as one where the two combatants are virtually identical.  Take Apple versus Android. More virtual blood has been spilled online by mouth-frothing, crazy-eyed barbarians over this little tiff than the great Mac versus Windows global conflict.  Both parties sally onto the field under shiny, tiny standards, claiming that their particular little lump of glowing metal and plastic is infinitely superior to the other – even though most sane people would have an easier time telling Coke from Pepsi.  They do the same job, access the same Internet, make the same phone calls, take the same pictures. It boils down, in the end, to philosophy. iPhone is posh and pretty and expensive; Android is more downmarket, slightly rougher at the edges but is a cheaper date. Apple is snooty. Android has a whiff of romantic uncertainty.  And the iPhone’s parents certainly don’t want it to go out with anything as sleazy as bitcoin. In a move that can only be described as unexpected if you’ve never had to deal with the company, Apple has slammed the door on Blockchain, the last remaining bitcoin wallet in the App Store (Google, on the other hand, lets Android stay out all night and skip school with the currency).    While this is entirely in keeping with Apple’s general principle of not allowing anything remotely controversial on the App Store unless it makes Apple enough money – and most certainly shutting down anything that looks as if it may affect Apple’s own revenue – it also comes with another Apple standard: the company refuses to say why it’s doing this. ""While you’re living under this roof you follow my rules young lady,"" is as far as it goes.      That wouldn’t matter so much, except that bitcoin is achingly cool with the hip kids; the venture capitalists; a growing body of the chattering – well, typing – classes; and thought leaders, in the unlovely vocab of marketing. They’re your shock troops in any war of popular opinion, the breakaway battalions that spot the high ground first and lead the poor bloody infantry to a new tactical position.      If you don’t keep some discipline here and outfit your First Regiment of Blog with cutting-edge ideas to fight with, they can defect en masse, sometimes taking their own weapons with them.      Google’s Android has always lacked the 'pure shiny' to really distract Apple’s lead boosters, but on the other hand – self-steering cars! Reality-augmenting glasses! Maps that work! It adds up. Apple, on the other hand, has “you can’t use bitcoin, because I say so” to put on the pile of autocratic decisions passim.      Apple has lost the mass market to Android, but it still has that high ground where the gold mines are. But only because Apple is cool – and that’s only because lots of smart people think it has the best toys. That’s no good if Mummy keeps taking them away. It’s especially annoying if Mummy won’t say why: a poor return on what can be a very large investment in the brand.      By itself, right now, banning bitcoin while not saying why won’t hurt Apple too much. This time next year, the field of battle may look very different.      Don’t think Google doesn’t know this. The chances of the company warming even more towards cybercurrency have just gone up another notch. There’s nothing as entertaining as a good war.    Over the counter doesn’t mean underhand  John Law is something of an old anarchist at heart, and is on record as repeatedly saying that bitcoin and its ilk are going to do their best work when they become generally usable by the masses.  As an investment vehicle – well, that’s up to you. But as a way of moving money around that provides a counterbalance to the power of the existing financial and state mechanisms? Good stuff. Bitcoin makes our life easier, cheaper and freer, and will encourage them to clean their own acts up. Profoundly democratic.  So you might think he’d be cheered up by the announcement that you can now buy bitcoins for cash at 28,000 UK shops.  This is via a service called ZipZap, that links its retail payment system to various bitcoin exchanges: you register with the exchange, ask ZipZap to create a document with various codes on it, print the thing out, take it to a local shop where they scan it in and take your cash. Minutes later – there's BTC in your wallet, no bank accounts required.  Try as he might, though, John Law remains ambivalent. The process is remarkably complicated – anything that requires computer printers is at least partially inspired by Beelzebub – although when CoinDesk’s managing editor tried it out for herself she found it curiously exciting.  One of the main points in favour of the idea is that it allows the 'unbanked' – the estimated 1.5 million adults in the UK who don’t have current accounts – to get stuck into bitcoin and, indeed, that’s a great benefit of cybercurrencies in general. But how many of those people have printers?    The real thing that probably sinks it as a game-changer, though, is the necessity to register at the exchanges with your ID. This is promoted by the regulators as a guard against money laundering: at the same time, though, we are warned against spreading our ID too freely over the Internet – and again, there’s little doubt that the unbanked will also be the group most uneasy, or unable, to manage their identity to governmental satisfaction.      It’s not as if the government seems too concerned about money laundering in other situations – it’s only reluctantly tackling a long-term problem with fixed-odds gambling machines, which are widely used in poorer areas to clean up tons of cash generated by underhand means. That’s different, of course, as the taxman gets his cut from such activities and the owners of the gambling industry are well-connected.      In any case, decent criminals know how to have decent criminal IDs. Like filtering the Internet to block naughtiness, this is the sort of restriction that doesn’t delay the expert against which it is nominally aimed but does mess up the average honest layman.      There is no easy answer, but there is a better compromise, which is to remove regulatory ID requirement for transactions up to a more useful amount. The gambling machines allow £100 stakes, for example, so why can’t someone waltz into a corner shop and buy £100 of bitcoin for cash?      At what point do the benefits of more liberal regulation get outweighed by abuse? This is the sort of calculation that can only be sorted out through the sort of decent, transparent discussion with proper numbers that politicians seem curiously reluctant to have.      Do you know what the Chancellor or the Home Secretary actually thinks about bitcoin? How that position was arrived at? Of course you don’t. But then, profound democracy is always a bit of a gamble.    More blessed to give than get a receipt  There’s another side to bitcoin anonymity: what do you do if you suspect you’ve received payment in stolen coin? This dilemma is troubling Dmitry Murashchik, director of Bitcoin100 which he runs to encourage other charities to start accepting bitcoin – if they do, he sends them some bitcoin.  He thinks that the 130 BTC he received when various exchanges were hacked was probably nicked – but he can’t prove it. This troubles him, but what to do?  In general, when charities receive stolen money and its source is known – as with hooky credit cards – then they return it at their own expense. Morally correct, and legally required. Can’t do that with bitcoin.  There are ways around this impasse, but nothing that always works. Murashchik asks that donors let him know when they make a donation, even if they don’t reveal their identity, but that doesn’t help in the case when a donation is completely unclaimed.  It’s a genuine moral quandary, of the sort bitcoin is delightfully prone to throw up. John Law applauds Murashchik for his principles of transparency, which is the best approach to moral quandaries yet invented.  When you genuinely don’t know what to do, show your workings. In the end, the usual fudge will ensue: charities will want to take bitcoin but will agree with the regulators a set of conditions under which it’ll be accepted, and what they’ll do about it otherwise.  Perhaps a central fund paid for out of dodgy donations, for making good thefts that do come to light, membership of which will give the charities legal protection from other action.  By being open about the discussions and considerations behind their thinking – a theme, Law realises, which links all three of his favourite stories this week – then it’s far easier to reach a consensus. No law, moral or state, can ever be effective without that sort of consensus – and with it, law is manageable and humane.  It’s the hundred little discussions like this one around the edge of cybercurrencies which are the real grease that eases the idea into general acceptance. John Law enjoys each and every one of them just as much as the fireworks and the big numbers.  This is where real history is made, and if you’re not enjoying being part of real history as you dig into bitcoin, you’re in the wrong game.

42425415,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHx7Zh,1391810115,"Silk Road Accused Ulbricht Pleads Not Guilty, Begins Long Defense","Ross Ulbricht, the Texas native arrested in San Francisco last October in relation to the Silk Road online black marketplace, has entered a formal plea of 'not guilty' to all charges.  The indictment hearing for the man accused of being the site's 'Dread Pirate Roberts' comes after more than 120 days in detention and interestingly, did not include any of the (up to) six alleged attempts to murder Silk Road cohorts by contract, none of which resulted in an actual death.  The hearing and not-guilty plea comes after Ulbricht was formally indicted last Tuesday on charges of drug trafficking, money laundering, computer hacking and of being the 'kingpin' on a drug trafficking enterprise.  The last charge, distinct from mere drug trafficking, is aimed at organized crime bosses and actually the most severe one Ulbricht faces. Anyone found guilty of that particular crime faces a minimum and mandatory 20 year prison sentence.  Defense strategy begins now  The main trial has not yet begun. With the indictment hearing done, It's now up to Ulbricht and his team to start building a defence. It won't be a small task: the prosecution is bound to throw all its resources into such a novel and high-profile case, and the Feds have reportedly collected 8-10 terabytes of evidence that includes the entirety of Silk Road's digital operation.  The defense team, including Ulbricht himself, will have a few months to review all that evidence. Ulbricht’s lawyer, Joshua Dratel, hinted the team may focus on the means used to gather the evidence and surveil Ulbricht's activities.  As reported in Forbes, this could show that some of the NSA's surveillance techniques were used to investigate the Silk Road case, bringing them and the question of their legal validity in such cases to the forefront.  Dratel also added on Tuesday that the indictment, together with the new 'kingpin' charge, ""does not contain any new factual allegations.""  Returning bitcoin treasure  A legal defense fund for Ulbricht on Crowdtilt has raised just over $10,000 (though its target is $500,000). He was denied a $1m bail proposal in November on the grounds he represented a serious flight risk.  Ulbricht has also formally claimed to have 29,000 BTC returned to him, part of the 170,000 BTC the Feds seized. Presumably this means he will claim the bitcoins had nothing to do with anything illegal and attempt to break the usual official allegations that bitcoin's popularity is thanks in part to its black market utility.  Another, UK-based, merchant who sold accessories on Silk Road also intends to claim 100 BTC in seized funds, saying his activities were not illegal.

42397361,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaq2Gj,1391807872,BTC-e Exchange Pulls Support for Ruble,"Bulgarian bitcoin exchange BTC-e has pulled support for the ruble, following a statement by the Russian Prosecutor's Office.  In a notice issued today, the government agency said that it has seen growing interest in the cryptocurrency, including from money launderers. As such, it sought to clarify that cryptocurrency does not meet the definition of legal tender under domestic law.  “The official Russian currency is the ruble. The use of any other monetary instruments or surrogates is forbidden,"" it said, citing Russian Article 27 of Russia's Federal Law, regarding the Central Bank of Russia.  The announcement is the clearest indication yet of its position regarding cryptocurrencies.  It reads:  ""The anonymous payment systems and crypto-currencies, including bitcoin - which is the most popular of them - are monetary surrogates. As such, their use by private citizens or legal entities is not allowed.""  BTC-e withdraws ruble support  In response, BTC-e announced that it would discontinue support for the ruble.  ""In connection with decision-making in relation to the crypto-currency in Russia working with QIWI suspended indefinitely, as well as with other payment systems in Russia,"" said the exchange, in a (translated) news posting only visible for those with their locale set to Russia.  [post-quote]  ""All financial obligations are met in full means available without commission.  Recommend that you use the system OKPAY (USD, EUR), interest on the conclusion on it is reduced to zero.  We apologize for any inconvenience.""  In the last few days, BTC-e had reported some technical work on its QIWI interface. BTC-e did not respond to queries, but as of this evening UK time, there was no 'deposit' option for rubles on BTC-e's account management pages.  Russia's decision to clarify its opinion on how existing law captures bitcoin was made at a meeting of an inter-agency working group this week.  Attendees included the deputy chair of the Central Bank of Russia, and heads of relevant departments of the Bank of Russia. Officials from the Russian FSB and the Russian Interior Ministry were also there.  Market impact  This development wasn't unexpected, however. The Bank of Russia issued a warning in late January, also citing Article 27, and warning that the issuing of cryptocurrencies in the Russian Federation could be considered illegal.  The head of Sberbank, the third-largest bank in Europe, has been bullish on bitcoin, affirming his support as recently as late January. But, the Bank of Russia is the state bank and a powerful institution that mirrors government policy.  The news comes on a bad day for bitcoin, following reports that Mt Gox had halted all bitcoin withdrawals.  That, along with the Russian news, is doubtless what sent prices plummeting today. The price had levelled out on 6th February after dropping around 4.5% to $804. Then, on 5th February at around 5:30 UK time, it began dropping drastically, reaching around $664 at 8am today. Twelve hours later, a rally appeared to have faltered, as prices dropped again.  At the time of posting, the CoinDesk Price Index stood at around $729.

42397358,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaq2Cn,1391807431,Coinbase Moves to Calm Security Concerns Amid Theft Reports,"Andreessen Horowitz-backed bitcoin wallet provider Coinbase confirmed via a company blog post on 7th February that ""a small handful"" of its customers have fallen victim to phishing attacks.  The reports of bitcoin wallet security vulnerabilities, however small, have nonetheless reverberated widely in an industry that is being increasingly cast in a shroud of uncertainty by the mainstream media.  A separate account of the incidents by online news source The Verge paints a very different picture of the situation, suggesting that the thefts, while in some cases the fault of Coinbase's users, were sizable and perhaps more frequent than has been reported.  The Verge confirmed what it called ""a string of Bitcoin thefts that have hit the service in recent weeks"".  In its piece, it profiled the story of a Coinbase user named Jeff, who lost 10.6 BTC in bitcoins due to theft this December. What's most unique about Jeff's story, however, is that one month later, his refunded money was stolen from the service yet again.  The media outlet revealed that it has confirmed two separate thefts occurred to users on the service in addition to Jeff's multiple thefts, for amounts of $16,000 and $5,000, respectively.  The sum total of the thefts, as noted by the piece, is roughly $40,000.  The extent of the attacks  The security firm FireEye told the Verge that it believes it is unlikely that Coinbase suffered a system-wide vulnerability, and that instead, each individual victim was compromised in isolation.  However, it suggested that Coinbase's ""unusually powerful"" API may have been a factor:  ""The right API key will let any program move bitcoins in and out of a given accounts. Once the key is compromised, attackers can even access linked bank accounts to purchase more bitcoins. Users are advised not to authorize the API key if they don't need it, but if an account has been compromised, hackers may decide to authorize it themselves.""  FireEye did suggest that the company itself does not seem responsible for the attacks, which were not aimed at its infrastructure. Further, it suggested that Coinbase's user agreement clearly states that individuals are responsible for the safety of their private keys.  By using the wallet provider's two-factor authentication, the report suggested, Jeff could have prevented the loss of his API key, which once his account was compromised may have been reactivated by the hackers.  Coinbase reacts  The San Francisco-based company downplayed the thefts, stating that ""phishing is unfortunately common across the Internet"", and noting that it affects banking institutions, payment processors and retailers in the traditional financial system as well.  Further, the company indicated that, because of the concern over phishing attacks, it has implemented enhanced security measures, that when used with best practices for web surfing, can help limit these occurrences:  ""We’ve implemented a number of increased security measures, including expanded two-factor authentication measures designed to help lessen the likelihood of successful phishing incidents in the future. We’ve also added an email verification step for key actions, such as when an API key is enabled.""  Coinbase representatives declined further requests for comment, stating that the blog post represented their official position on the attacks.

42397360,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaq2Ih,1391802449,"Following Mt. Gox Sell-Off, Cyprus Warns of Bitcoin's Volatility","The Central Bank of Cyprus (CBC) issued a warning on 7th February to its 1.1 million residents advising them that virtual currencies such as bitcoin are not legal tender and should be treated with caution because of their perceived volatility.      The CBC further noted in its statements that it does not condone any activity that falls under its jurisdiction, ""unless it can ensure the legality of that activity"". The agency added:      ""Activities without the necessary licensing are in breach of legislation.""              Elsewhere, the CBC reminded its citizens to be cautions about virtual currency investments, and to ""examine all aspects of the use of virtual currencies"" before electing to invest.      The announcement is particularly noteworthy as it comes less a day after Mt. Gox halted withdrawals, causing the price of bitcoin to experience its largest fluctuations in weeks. Further, the Cyprus banking crisis is largely credited with the spike in interest in bitcoin in March of 2013, and the nation is often cited as being a market where a solution such as virtual currency might become widespread.    Lack of regulatory safeguards    The CBC used the release to remind citizens about the volatility of virtual currency. The release included references to the posibility that virtual currency ""platforms or exchanges"" could collapse, putting citizens at risk.      ""In particular, the public should be aware that there are no regulatory safeguards to cover losses from using virtual currency,"" the release stated.      The statement went on to name four major risks associated with virtual currencies:    There are no consumer protections for those invested in virtual currencies  The value of virtual currencies may rise, fall or be eliminated  The trade of virtual currencies helps facilitate criminal activities  The acceptance of virtual currencies can be revoked at any time.  Fertile ground for bitcoin    The Cypriot government was at the center of international controversy in 2013 after it decided to adopt a ""bail-in"" strategy to deal with its struggling banks. As part of this initiative, authorities transferred all assets under €100,000 to the CBC and instituted 47.5% losses on deposits exceeding this benchmark.      The announcement sparked outrage on the island nation itself, with many citizens noting they felt as if they were being robbed by their government.      However, bitcoin and virtual currencies soon emerged as a potential solution.      “The most fertile ground for bitcoin is in places like Cyprus, Argentina, Iceland, China and other countries which have experienced significant financial disruptions and/or maintain strict financial controls,"" Garrick Hileman, economic historian at the London School of Economics, told CoinDesk this November.      Those with more conservative and libertarian financial ideologies responded as well.      As Guillaume Babin-Tremblay, executive director of the Bitcoin Embassy in Quebec, noted in an article for Forbes:      “Bitcoins were growing slowly until Cyprus. Cyprus was the catalyst for the big increase in the price. The price started trading at about $40 and then doubled within a couple of days.""              Whether this announcement will have any affect on bitcoin's growth in the country, remains to be seen.

42397355,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaq2Fk,1391799779,LocalBitcoins.com Users Face Criminal Charges in Florida,"At least two men in Florida have been charged for moving large volumes of bitcoins via the popular person-to-person exchange LocalBitcoins.com. They were charged under state anti-money-laundering laws following an investigation by the US Secret Service, said reports.  Security blogger Brian Krebs reported that Michell Abner Espinoza of Miami Beach was arrested after a sting in which an undercover agent engaged him in a fake transaction to convert $30,000 worth of cash into bitcoins.  In addition, 29-year-old Pascal Reid was also arrested after meeting with an undercover agent to exchange $30,000 for bitcoins.  The charges  Both of the men are being charged under two laws. The first is Florida's anti-money laundering law, which targets money exchanges above $10,000.  The second is running an unlicensed money transmission business. Statute 560.125 forbids people from exgaging in frequent unlicensed money transmission-type transactions of more than $300 but less than $20,000 in any 12-month period in the state.  Depending on the amount involved, it is considered a felony of the third, second, or first-degree. Exchanging more than $100,000 in funds during any 12-month period is considered a first-degree felony. Fines of twice the currency value, up to a value of $250,000, are possible.  Espinoza, said to go under the name MichaelHack on LocalBitcoins.com, had trades involving more than 150 bitcoins in the last six months, say reports.  Headquartered in Finland, LocalBitcoins.com is a person-to-person trading website, which facilitates trades both online and in person. Unlike exchanges that automatically reconcile trades using an online order book, exchanges like LocalBitcoins.com let users find each other, and handle the trades themselves. The site has been gaining popularity rapidly in recent months, adding roughly 1,000 users each day.  LocalBitcoins reacts  Jeremias Kangas, the owner of LocalBitcoins.com, wasn't aware of the charges when contacted by CoinDesk. He explained that the site relied on users to follow the laws in their own countries when conducting trades. ""That’s our guideline. But it’s quite difficult for us to look after everyone,"" he said.  Currently, users are expected to verify each other themselves when handling in-person trades, Kangas noted. The company has been working on a central verification system, although that has not yet been implemented.  ""This is inevitable of course,"" said Kangas of the Florida incident. ""We have to have more scrutiny and tools to watch that everything on our website is legal, and our users can follow their local laws. We are spending a lot of resources on that, but we are a startup.""  Localbitcoins.com does not limit the size of trades, admitted Kangas. ""That might be possible, actually. We haven’t thought about that,"" he said.  Next steps  Espinoza had his bond hearing today, and faces three charges; two related to money laundering amounts under $20,000 and between $20,000 and $100,000. The third charge relates to money transmission services for amounts between $20,000 and $100,000.  Reid's case details were not yet on file at the time of writing, but he is being tried for unlicensed money transmission services on a third degree felony.

42397365,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaq2Nc,1391795526,SecondMarket Takes First Step to Becoming a US Bitcoin Exchange,"SecondMarket has taken its first step to becoming a US-based bitcoin exchange, the company's founder and CEO Barry Silbert has suggested.  Silbert took to Twitter today to announce that his alternative investment company is now buying bitcoins from interested sellers, then told CoinDesk this could mark a move into the US exchange market. He said:  ""There is a clear need for a US-based, regulated, compliant and trustworthy bitcoin exchange. This could be the first step in that direction.""  The announcement follows Mt. Gox's decision to halt all bitcoin withdrawals from its service one day earlier. The surprise move sent bitcoin markets into decline in the hours that followed, and caused uncertainty to spread throughout the bitcoin community.  Silbert did not mention the big-picture implications of the new service in his Twitter post, but did indicate that SecondMarket is now open to both buyers and sellers.    Announcement: Our bitcoin trading team is making a market on a pilot basis. Buy/sell and settle same day. Min 25 BTC https://t.co/STT967lwPR      — Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) February 7, 2014    Expanding activities  Founded in 2004, SecondMarket offers a number services in addition to its most high-profile offering, the Bitcoin Investment Trust launched last September. To date, the private trust has raised approximately 80,000 BTC in holdings for its target investors, which primarily include high-earning Wall Street professionals and tech entrepreneurs.    ""Expanding these activities is a pilot intended to determine what buyer and seller demand exists beyond our current activities in support of the Bitcoin Investment Trust,"" Silbert said.      If Silbert's own estimates are accurate, the company is growing fast. Speaking at the Disruptive Technologies Speaker Series earlier this week, Silbert indicated that the Bitcoin Investment Trust had raised just 70,000 BTC.      As for the transaction minimum of 25 BTC (roughly $18,000 at press time), Silbert said that the decision was a practical matter.      ""Our market making, in its current form [and] structure, is high touch, and facilitating a large number of small transactions would not be feasible,"" he noted.      Timing the decision    While Silbert did suggest that the news from Mt. Gox provided additional value to his company's newest offering, the move to begin openly working with sellers did not happen overnight. Silbert noted that his team has been sourcing bitcoin on and off exchanges since last year, but that additional services like this might be needed to meet demand.  Silbert, who spoke on day one of last week's NYDFS hearings and recently made Forbes' 40 Under Forty class of 2013, has been vocal about his belief that ""2014 will be the year of bitcoin on Wall Street"".  The investor says that this new pilot service is meant to help SecondMarket grow as it furthers its base of Wall Street and institutional investors, who he expects will soon be moving into the asset class with more frequency.      How SecondMarket selling works  To begin selling bitcoins to SecondMarket, sellers will need to first fill out a New Account Profile (NAP) form. This NAP form asks basic questions such as the name and address of the individual, and source of the funds.  Those representing entities will need to complete a separate, lengthier NAP form. From there, the transaction takes an additional five steps to complete.

42397359,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaq2Hi,1391789624,Australian Retailer Millennius Halts iPhone Sales in Apple Boycott,"Leading Australian e-tailer Millennius has stopped selling iPhones to protest against Apple’s decision to remove the blockchain.info app from its app store.  Millennius  is a key proponent of bitcoin, and has called for wider deployment of the currency in the past. The company argues that bitcoin could lower prices online as payments are cheaper than traditional credit card payments and these savings could be passed down to consumers.  Betraying ideals  The blockchain.info app was the only bitcoin-related app in Apple’s walled garden of delights, and it had more than 120,000 users. The backlash on social media has been huge and some iPhone owners even smashed their phones in protest.  “Apple seems to have betrayed its own ideals, and those who believed in the brand,” said Millennius founder Pierre Boutros.  “Millennius has decided to suspend sales of the current versions of the iPhone [4, 4s, 5, 5c and 5s] until Bitcoin wallets allowed are back on the Apple app store.”  Boutros admits that the move will hurt his company’s bottom line. He is calling for other bitcoin-friendly iPhone retailers to do the same, thus applying pressure on Apple to reverse its decision.  Ironically, smartphones are the best selling product sold for bitcoins via Millennius. In addition, the company points out that in the six months since it started accepting bitcoin and litecoin, it has not had a single fraudulent transaction.  “This has only been done in response to Apple as it has so poorly communicated its reasons for such a decision,” Boutros said.  “We can only see the decision as hostile towards the bitcoin ecosystem, and therefore need to take action just like those in the community who have made their switch away from iPhones.”  Android to the rescue  Apple’s position on bitcoin is clear, as is its restrictive App Store policy. The company's guidelines been around for years, and are unlikely to change despite the backlash. Blockchain has issued a statement which was highly critical of Apple, but quick to praise rival Google.  Google’s Play Store remains wide open: there’s no routine vetting, and there are already dozens of bitcoin apps for Android devices.  Blockchain also pointed out that in removing its iOS app, Apple has eliminated competition using their monopolistic position in the market in a “heavy handed” manner.  While there is no sign that cryptocurrency supporters will boycott Apple, the move might have a slight impact on sales and Apple’s reputation. In other words, it could drive a number of consumers to competing platforms – namely Android.  Of course, another alternative for iOS fans are web-based wallets, like the HTML5/JS-based Coinpunk.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | LTC | MARKET,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/07/australian-retailer-millennius-halts-iphone-sales-in-apple-boycott,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0cfa4ef2481a8966d3c77af48365000b0320aef8-1058x768.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397369,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaq2Pa,1391779696,KnCMiner Offers 'Plan B' in Case of Neptune Miner Delivery Delay,"One of the leaders in the bitcoin mining hardware market is planning contingencies for its future product lineup in case of delay.  KnCMiner,  a Stockholm-based bitcoin mining hardware company, has introduced a new program for its customers - Plan B.  Plan B will help compensate for possible setbacks in the shipment of the company’s new 20nm chip miner, due out later this year.  Plan B details  “Plan B is simple,” Sam Cole, one of KnCMiner's co-founders, told CoinDesk: “If we face a delay or any type, we will give each person a choice.”  This is a plan that the company is putting in place for paying customers of its latest model, the 3TH/s Neptune miner. The options are as follows:    1. Continue to wait.      2. Take a USD refund.    3. Convert to 3TH of hosting performance for a period (still to be worked out, but is likely to be around 6 months).    “All other capacity of our mine will then be offered via cloud hosted services directly from ourselves,” Cole said regarding the last option.  His idea is to try and reduce customer risk – ensuring a long-term business relationship. “This way, the customer has no risk they can pull out, stay in or convert – and let us simply supply the hashing to them,” he said.  Datacenter hashing  KnCMiner’s third option  for Neptune buyers is to provide cloud hashing power in a datacenter. Cole said that the facility hosting the hashing is expected to be “one of the world’s largest”.  The facility will be located in Sweden. “It’s in the north, not far from the arctic circle on an old army base,” he added.  ""Over the next few months we are bringing online enough hashing power to make sure that any delay in the Neptune timeline will be compensated with completely free hosted hashing packages to all fully paid customers.""  The datacenter will be using renewable energy from hydro power sources – which won't come cheap. “It’s a multimillion dollar center and is funded with the profit we made selling Jupiters,” Cole explained.  The Jupiter was a previous KnCMiner model that began shipping last October. That initial ASIC unit had 550 GH/s of power.  Last November, as the price of bitcoin began a substantial tear upward, and CoinDesk reported that KnCMiner had sold $3m worth of mining equipment within four days.  Alexander Lawn, KnCMiner’s communications representative, recently told Forbes that his company had sold $25m in product over the final two weeks of December 2013.  New technology  Cole remains effusive about his company’s ability to deliver on its promises. KnCMiner was able to release a 28nm chip for its Jupiter miner rather quickly. Today, only a small number of other hardware producers are shipping product with that particular node.  Plan B is a way to guarantee KnCMiner customers that the hashing power they paid for will be available. Cole said: “We will always deliver the performance targets.”  KnCMiner is working hard to bring the Neptune to market. But Cole concedes that the fact the 20nm chip node has not hit the mainstream is causing some snags.  “We may face delays as the technology is so new Apple won’t even have a 20nm product for a few years,” he said. KnCMiner’s Neptune model will have the 20nm chip, and is expected to ship in the second quarter of 2014.  The unit will have a minimum hashing speed of 3TH/s, which is 3,000GH/s. The units are $9,995 a piece, and will be in a limited production run of 1,200 total.  A first batch run of these 20nm miners sold out when they went on sale back in November. Pre-order registration for the second batch Neptune production run is still open on KnCMiner’s website.

42397366,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaq2Le,1391772172,Leading UK Computer Retailer 'Scan' Accepts Bitcoin,"Scan Computers has started accepting bitcoin payments, making it the first major PC retailer to accept the cryptocurrency in the UK.  Scan  is a bit more than your average PC retailer. It is a big player in the channel, it is one of the biggest sellers of high-end computers in the UK and it builds a range of pre-overlocked rigs for enthusiasts.  A crypto love affair  Since it caters to a geeky user base, Scan quickly recognized that digital currency was an interesting trend to cash in on.  As a result, the retailer decided to start selling mining rigs under its own 3XS brand. So far, the effort has been limited to litecoin miners (the rigs are essentially PCs configured to mine litecoins).  Scan’s James Gorbold told PCR Online that the company is also evaluating other digital currencies like litecoin, but for the time being it is only accepting bitcoins. He added:  ""Our customers want to spend bitcoins, we want to embrace that and allow our customers to pay how they want to. It's the next logical step forward, from cash to cheque and payment cards.""  Plenty of potential  Gorbold said Scan likes to think of itself as an innovator, and that he believes it is the first company in the sector to embrace bitcoin. He added that Scan is excited about the potential of bitcoin and doesn't want to follow the crowd – it wants to try out new ideas.  Like many other retailers, Scan uses BitPay to handle payments.  Users simply need to choose bitcoin as their payment method, complete the order with bitcoin and BitPay will take care of the rest. It will convert the value of the order and the buyer can then either scan the QR code or manually transfer the amount to the displayed wallet address.  The transaction requires six confirmations, it is also possible to cancel orders and receive refunds using the exchange rate at the time of refund.  British merchants are doing quite well in cross-border sales. Britain is not in the Eurozone and since 2008 the GBP/EUR exchange rate has worked in the nation's favour.  In many cases it is cheaper to buy and ship a computer or high-end graphics card from Britain than it is to buy one in many Eurozone members. Digital currencies have the potential to make British e-tailers even more competitive.  Disclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.

42397350,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaq28r,1391767461,Fits and Startups,"Everyone in the bitcoin community is understandably irate at Apple right now.  Many of us have spent thousands of dollars on Apple products, some have spent hundreds of hours developing iOS apps and millions of current and future bitcoin users will be negatively impacted by Apple's de facto ban on all things bitcoin.  Still, things have a way of working themselves out, and if bitcoin is as indestructible as many in the community say, the tech giant's screw-up will hurt Apple more than bitcoin.  From my vantage point, the Apple furor has buried another story that bitcoiners have not adequately recognized or appreciated. Dan Primack, a senior editor at Fortune, wrote his most recent article for the print and online editions of the magazine on bitcoin. And it is outstanding. Primack writes:  ""Bitcoin's primary significance is not about whether it supplants cash. It's about a revolutionary computer-science breakthrough that has the potential to upend all sorts of established industries … VCs are playing a ... long game on bitcoin because they recognize its ability to exponentially increase Internet functionality, both in payments and beyond.""  He goes on to clearly explain why concepts like Bitcoin's distributed public ledger and ability to decentralize trust could spark innovations in industries well outside of that of traditional payments. While Primack is certainly not the first mainstream media writer or pundit to demonstrate that he ""gets"" bitcoin, he is one of the most important.  But why?  Primack is the go-to source for news and analysis on the venture capital and private equity industries. He has nearly 35,000 twitter followers and over 60,000 email subscribers to his daily ""Term Sheet,"" and I know from experience in the industry that his missives are required reading for those investing private capital on behalf of their limited partners.  Primack, in essence, speaks directly into a megaphone aimed squarely at the people who matter most in bitcoin right now: professional investors.  Over the past two months, I have quizzed friends and former colleagues from the investment community about their firm's attitude towards bitcoin. One principal at a brand-name VC told me he considered Bitcoin to be somewhere ""between slightly useless and useless.""  Another who I knew to cover payments for his firm, dismissed Bitcoin as ""that black market payments network"". Others met with me with the hope that I would give them a ""Bitcoin 101"" in order to learn whether it was ""even worth it for their firm to diligence the industry"". You get the idea.  Curiosity  Primack's endorsement may change that. I'm not suggesting that seasoned investors will immediately begin falling over each other to fund bitcoin startups. However, this kind of exposure may pique the curiosity of skeptics, and it may turn the curious into eager investors.  Casual observers of bitcoin will read about Apple's bitcoin ban ad nauseam this week, but despite the buzz, the news simply won't deter serious investors looking to fund the next disruptive technology company.  Instead, the bitcoin article most investors heed this morning will hit their inbox from a niche finance writer who knows what he's talking about when it comes to VC.  Today, the people who fund the next wave of bitcoin innovators are reading better news than you think. And it has nothing to do with Apple.

42397367,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaq2QZ,1391759231,"Mt. Gox Halts ALL Bitcoin Withdrawals, Price Drop Follows","UPDATE (7th February, 11:25 GMT): Users with bitcoin withdrawals in limbo have reported that the amounts are being returned to their Mt. Gox wallet balances.  Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, the third-largest for trading the US dollar for bitcoin by 30-day volume, has announced it is temporarily pausing bitcoin withdrawals.  The company has released a statement on its websitehttps://www.mtgox.com/press_release_20140207.html that says the following:    Dear MtGox Customers,      During our efforts to resolve the issue being encountered by some bitcoin withdrawals it was determined that the increase in withdrawal traffic is hindering our efforts on a technical level. As to get a better look at the process the system needs to be in a static state.    In order for our team to resolve the withdrawal issue it is necessary to temporarily pause all withdrawal traffic to obtain a clear technical view of the current processes.    We apologize for the extremely short notice, but as of now all bitcoin withdrawals will be paused, and withdrawals in the queue will returned to your MtGox wallet and can be re-intiated once the issue is resolved. Customers can still use the trading platform as usual.    Our team will be working hard through the weekend and will provide an update on Monday, February 10, 2014 (JST).    Again, we apologize for the inconvenience, and ask for your continued patience and support while we work to resolve this issue.    Best regards,    The MtGox Team    Mt. Gox has been suffering from lengthy delays transferring bitcoin to USD and transferring to US bank accounts for some time now, but similar issues recently extended to those looking to withdraw fiat values in other major currencies like euro and Japanese yen.  The Bitcoin Price Index, which currently includes Mt. Gox (as well as Bitstamp and BTC-e) shows the bitcoin price starting to drop last night, and falling a further $75 from today's open down to $709 at the time of writing.  Bitcoin-specific withdrawal problems  Most recently Mt. Gox's issues with getting money out of the exchange have extended even to withdrawals in actual bitcoin.  Reports of sporadic difficulties withdrawing BTC from Mt. Gox began to trickle in as early as late December, but increased in the 72 hours leading up to this announcement.  At first, users reported getting an erroneous ""Invalid Bitcoin Address"" error message when attempting to transfer - something that has happened several times in the past and is said to be due to the exchange's 'hot wallet' running dry in times of great demand.  Even supposedly successful transactions, which the Mt. Gox website will have claimed to have occurred, often do not register on bitcoin's public block chain. One user, who tried this morning to withdraw a substantial amount of bitcoin, told this story:    I had BTC sitting in my Gox account for a few weeks then decided to transfer to my home PC wallet. I had transferred BTC to and from Mt Gox several times since November last year without any problems. On Feb 4th at 2:15pm I made the transfer unaware that others were already experiencing problems with 'stuck' transactions. After I committed the transfer, the Gox website immediately issued a transaction hash and deducted the BTC plus a fee from my account. When I checked several hours later that transaction hash was not found on the blockchain. Needless to say, nothing has appeared in my wallet.      I raised three support tickets but none have yet been assigned to an agent. When I search google for ""Mt. Gox BTC withdrawal problem"" I find there are hundreds of people with the same or similar issues.    Even smaller withdrawals were affected, with other users reporting similar stories when attempting to withdraw amounts of less than 1 BTC.  Graphs on Bitcoincharts.com showed bitcoin trading volume increasing markedly over the past 24 hours or so. At the time of writing, since midnight on the 6th February UTC, over 45,084 BTC has been traded on Mt. Gox - compared to only 11,348 in the entire 48 hour period before that.  Coinsight.org  , which tracks data based on each exchange's public API, showed an hourly increase in Mt. Gox's BTC withdrawal volumes and 'stuck' withdrawals until 13:00 Japan time, when there was a vertical drop. Numbers began rising again almost immediately after.  Turbulent history  Many users had thought their bitcoin balances were relatively secure, at least compared to national currency amounts, and could be transferred to a local wallet at a moment's notice. Mt. Gox has not indicated there will be any difficulty doing that once its technical problems are ironed out.  This was the expectation, given bitcoin is considered 'sound money' by its fans and that Mt. Gox is not a fractional reserve bank subject to problems with a 'bank run' in digital currency. If a bitcoin is listed in a wallet, users presume it may be transferred or withdrawn without delay.  Were Mt. Gox to collapse, or even render itself unreliable as a platform, a large portion of bitcoin trade would either scramble for a new home or disappear altogether, which could have a dramatic effect on bitcoin's value.  Founded originally by serial tech innovator Jed McCaleb in 2009 as an exchange for Magic: The Gathering Online players, Mt. Gox was turned into a bitcoin-only exchange in 2010 before being sold to Mark Karpeles and his company Tibanne Ltd., the current owner.  Mt. Gox  was the largest and, for many, the only bitcoin-fiat currency exchange from bitcoin's introduction until last year.  While it had endured hacks, price crashes and double-spend crises in the past, it was the most well-known and used exchange for large-scale bitcoin traders until competitors such as Bitstamp, BTC China and BTC-e began to usurp its power.  It accounted for over 70% of global trading volume in April 2013 and its price has traditionally been the highest, apart from certain times in 2013 when BTC China held the record or when Bitstamp managed to overtake it.  A series of misfortunes since April have seen Mt. Gox's USD trading fall to an 18% market share, just behind Europe's Bitstamp and BTC-e with 30% and 25% respectively.  Criticism  Although criticisms have often been leveled at Mt. Gox throughout its history and reached a crescendo by the end of 2013, the company has also suffered from external forces.  Payment processor Dwolla experienced a suspension of transactions to and from Mt. Gox, initiated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in May 2013.  Following that, in August a Mt. Gox subsidiary in the US, Mutum Sigillum LLC, lost $2.9m in a seizure of its Dwolla account by the DHS. That deparment of the federal government claimed that the company had concealed its business as a money transmitter and failed to register as such with FinCEN.  The DHS seized a further $2.1m from Mt. Gox's two Wells Fargo accounts in the US, one of them under Mutum Sigillum's name and one in CEO Karpeles' own name. Federal testimonies have since revealed the seizures had more to do with users' Silk Road related activities than FinCEN's rules.  With $5m in reserves gone, and with US banks and payment processors alike refusing to engage in further business with them, Mt. Gox has since struggled to transfer funds into the US and to its many American customers.  A dispute with another US partner, bitcoin incubator CoinLab, saw Mt. Gox sued for $75m in September 2013. Mt. Gox countersued for $5.5m, claiming CoinLab had also failed to register as a money transmitter and jeopardized the business. The case is still ongoing.  Users of the Bitcointalk forums have been complaining about Mt. Gox's withdrawal problems for the past few days. CoinDesk will continue to update this story as new information comes in.

42397357,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaq2El,1391742436,Washington Dispensary Now Takes Bitcoin for Cannabis,"Silk Road may be dead, but in at least one Washington State city, people can still buy marijuana and related products using bitcoin.  Medical marijuana dispensary Kouchlock Productions, which opened on Monday February 3, began accepting bitcoin for its wares this week. The dispensary, based in Spokane, is said to already have sold the drug in several bitcoin transactions.  In Washington State, medical dispensaries were legalized in 1998, under initiative 692. This allows dispensaries to sell the drug to patients with terminal or debilitating medical conditions including cancer, HIV-positive status, hepatitis C, and anorexia. A patient can be granted a permit by a naturopath.  While medical mariijuana dispensaries are legal in the state, they are still federally illegal, which makes it difficult for them to process credit cards. This makes bitcoin a useful alternative for them.  Along with Colorado, Washington State legalized pot use in November 2012. Washington's measure, Initiative 502, allows for the drug to be purchased from licensed retailers. License applications opened late last year.  Paradoxically, now that I502 has been passed, the days could be numbered for medical dispensaries. State Representative Eileen Cody has proposed a bill that would limit the amount of pot that patients (as opposed to non-patients) could possess.  The reasoning is that the untaxed medical dispensary business would undercut the legal business, which will be subject to taxes. The current limit for patient-owned pot is 24 ounces in any form, whereas I502 allows for personal possession of one ounce of usable marijuana.  Counter staff at Kouchlock Productions confirmed that the company was now accepting bitcoin. However store owner Scott O'Neil did not respond to questions yesterday. News reports suggest that the store plans to transition to a non-medical licensed retailer when licenses become available. Eventually, it is estimated that there will be hundreds of retail outlets in the state.  Some businesses are hoping to extend beyond simply selling the drug, which the government will also now allow to be grown for non-medical purposes.  Revenues from marijuana sales, both legal and illegal, amounts to around $1.2bn a year in Washington state, according to public policy research. 80% of the pot is said to be consumed by 200,000 particularly heavy users. In Colorado, where retailers are already open, taxes from the pot business were estimated to be between $1.24m and $3m in the first 30 days of operation.  Alaska is said to be close to becoming the third state to legalize pot, and entrepreneurs are getting interested. Diego Pellicer, founded by former Microsoft manager Jamen Shively, is building a brand of marijuana products, in the hope that the product will become legal in all states over the next ten years.  Bitcoin users can't legally order their marijuana over the Internet. I502 does not allow for home delivery or Internet orders, but nevertheless, home delivery based on phone orders is already a common under-the-radar occurrence in Eastern Washington.  It is now legal to own an ounce of weed, and lawmakers have said that they consider how it is delivered to be irrelevant. Law enforcement are said anecdotally to be disinterested in investigating these services, and they continue to flourish in advance of retail businesses opening this spring.
