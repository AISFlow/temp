42376583,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6W3Bh,1375981150,Bitcoin and Soylent meal replacement: new currency meets new nutrition,"A new product has come to the bitcoin table offering dieters and those strapped for time and cash the chance to exchange digital currency for a food substitute.  Soylent, which was created by entrepreneur Rob Rhinehart from Atlanta, Georgia, is a mixture of powdered starch, grape seed oil, compounds such as ferrous gluconate (iron) and vitamins, including vitamin C and vitamin D. It comes in a powder form, which is mixed with water to create a meal in a glass.  Soylent was dreamt up during the summer 2012 programme run by seed accelerator firm Y Combinator (YC). Rhinehart was initially creating affordable wireless networks for developing countries when he did what YC's co-founder Paul Graham described as ""the biggest pivot in YC history"".  The then-24-year-old came up with the idea for Soylent after hypothesising that the human body doesn't need food, just the chemicals and elements it is made of. He bought numerous tubs of various vitamins and supplements, created a mixture and, one morning, put his theory to the test.  ""It was delicious! I felt like I'd just had the best breakfast of my life. It tasted like a sweet, succulent, hearty meal in a glass, which is what it is, I suppose. I immediately felt full, yet energized, and started my day,"" he said in a post on his blog.  Rhinehart stuck to drinking Soylent for a month and, within that time, noticed a number of positive changes, from an increase in energy and improved concentration to whiter teeth and a greater appreciation of music.  He also enjoyed the fact he was saving money and time by not having to go grocery shopping, cook or wash dishes. Add to this the fact he lost 16lbs over the course of three weeks and you can see why Soylent might be appealing to a lot of people.  The sceptics  There are, understandably, plenty of sceptics who worry that Soylent isn't actually very healthy and could, in the long-term, do greater harm than good. This probably isn't helped by the origins of the name Soylent. Rhinehart said the name comes from the book Make Room! Make Room!, which features a foodstuff called soylent steaks, which are not made of meat, but soya and lentils. However, in the film Soylent Green, which is based on the book, the food substitute Soylent Green turns out to be made of human remains.  Regardless of this rather macabre association, Rhinehart told CoinDesk a lot of people still seem to be interested in the product, which is evident in that his crowdfunding campaign gained more than 10,000 backers.  Those reluctant to take advice on nutrition from an electrical engineering and computer science graduate may be interested in what a dietary specialist has to say.  Cara Sloss, spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, told CoinDesk: ""Meal substitutes should be used with caution. Many new products have limited research available for potential users to study and there is often little knowledge about the effects of long-term use.  ""In our hectic day-to-day lives some people may find it easier to grab a replacement meal on the run when there’s no time to stop for food. This is perfectly acceptable, providing you check the label of the product you’re buying.""  She said the notion that the human body needs to consume solids isn't true and gave the example that liquid diets are regularly used in hospitals when patients are unable to consume solid food. ""However, this is not recommended for everyone and anyone thinking about embarking on a liquid-only diet should consult their doctor for advice.""  Sloss also had a word of warning for weight watchers thinking of embarking on the Soylent diet: ""When using liquid meals as an aid for weight loss, be aware that we can often end up drinking more than we think! There have been studies showing that we are less likely to register the calories in liquid form and can end up actually consuming more than eating a solid meal.""  The believers  Regardless of some people's hesitations, Soylent is already proving highly popular, having received over $1 million worth of pre-orders. Customers will have to wait a while for their powder to arrive, as deliveries are not set to be processed until September, for the US; December, for Canada, the UK and Mexico; and March 2014 for all other EU countries.  Rhinehart said he decided to allow customers to pay in bitcoin because he ""loves"" the idea of a decentralised currency. ""It fits very closely with my philosophy. I would like to see the currency stabilise and use it at more places myself.""  To pay for Soylent in bitcoin, users simply select the package they want, head to the checkout and select the 'Bitcoin' tab. After entering their name and email address, customers will see a QR code and the company's wallet address, which they can then use to transfer their bitcoins.  Alternatively, users can pay with their Coinbase account, by entering their email address and password.  Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Coinbase found out about Soylent when it was in its early days. He approached one of the Soylent team and was given an early batch for the Coinbase team to test out.  ""We tried it for a few consecutive days. It's awesome because it's very efficient to use - you don't have to take the time to eat, you can just gradually drink the nutrients you need without stopping what you're doing,"" he explained.  Ehrsam said Soylent is also very cheap when compared to the average amount he would normally spend on food, plus, it made him really appreciate food when he did have it. ""In short, it separates eating out of necessity from eating out of pleasure.""  He stopped drinking Soylent after a couple of days because, as his batch was an early version, the mixture of ingredients was a little ""off"".  ""I'm sure it will be better tuned once it goes live to the public,"" Ehrsam added.  Below is Soylent's latest ingredients list posted on the company's blog. These are the main ingredients – Soylent contains some other vitamins and minerals that are not listed.  Maltodextrin (carbs)  Oat powder (carbs, fiber, protein, fat)  Rice protein  Medium chain triglycerides (fat)  Potassium gluconate  Salt (sodium)  Magnesium gluconate  Monosodium phosphate  Calcium carbonate  Methylsulfonylmethane (sulfur)  Creatine  Powdered soy lecithin  Choline bitartrate  Ferrous gluconate (iron)  What do you make of the idea?

42376585,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6W37v,1375978333,Cointerra's 500 Gigahash per chip bid to change ASIC market,"Yet another ASIC mining company has entered the fray - and this time, with an extremely bold performance claim. Cointerra promises the smartest chip design and the best price-performance ratio we've yet seen in the ASIC market. But can customers afford to wait for it?  The ASIC mining business was all about getting to market first, and we have seen some embarrassing episodes along the way, with some firms repeatedly setting back delivery dates, and revising power-performance ratios.  But designs have also been getting more sophisticated. One of the biggest innovations has been in the process node, which is the size of a typical transistor on a chip. ASIC mining chips have moved from 110 nm, down from 65 nm, to 28 nm designs. The advantage of making transistors smaller is that you can fit more of them on a chip, which means a higher hash rate in the same space, and lower power requirements. KnCMiner garnered lots of attention when it announced a 28 nm design, with units scheduled for release in September.  But it isn't just about packing more transistors into a smaller space, says Cointerra founder Ravi Iyengar, who says that he is using his chip design experience to optimize the ASIC’s inner circuitry.  “Inside the ASIC chips, there are a number of hash engines and you need to ensure that there is an intelligent distribution of workload,” he says. “You want to ensure that you're not duplicating them, and that you're not keeping any of the chips idle. They have to be constantly working, with good and real work.”  Iyengar knows his stuff. He left his job as lead CPU architect at Samsung to found Cointerra. One of his favourite tricks is holding up his Android phone and pointing out that he designed the processor inside it.  Cointerra  is designing its ASICs with extra tricks for power efficiency, too, he says. The upshot of it is that he hopes to get to market with the best ASIC units yet in the second half of Q4. It is promising at least 500 Gigahashes per second on a single chip called GoldStrike1 (GS1).  Much of the design innovation is still Iyengar’s secret sauce, and he is building intellectual property around it, he says, but we do know at least one accepted industry technique he'll be using: increasing the size of each chip (known as the die size).  Each chip must be put into a hardware package that makes it usable on a circuit board. The package does important things like communicating between the chip and the board, and dissipating heat from the chip. By increasing the die size, Iyengar will also increase the amount of silicon per package. The cost of the package also increases with its size, but not linearly, meaning that a larger die size contained in a larger package will cost less than several smaller chips encased in several packages.  Techniques like this, along with his ASIC design, will enable Cointerra to produce a chip that will consume significantly less than 1 Watt per Gigahash, the company says. If he can pull it off, that will indeed give him an advantage over KnCMiner, which offers around 2.5 Watts per Gigahash.  That's attractive, but the firm will still be two months or more behind KnCMiner with its devices. In the crazy world of ASIC mining, that's a significant window. As these machines come on stream, they will push up the hashing difficulty on the bitcoin network, making it increasingly hard to do the calculations necessary to solve a transaction block.  ""When you make your chips extremely efficient in terms of performance per area, and you make it extremely power efficient as well, then scaling becomes far easier,” he says. The idea is that it might take tens of chips from competitors to reach a Terahash in computing power, whereas Cointerra can do it by putting two in a single box – and keeping the power consumption relatively low. So, in short, if you want to offset the increase in difficulty as ASIC miners pour onto the market, then buy something scalable so that you can cram more hashes into a box.  We won't know how much these boxes will cost until Cointerra releases pricing information, which it promises to do within the month. Still, Iyengar promises a reasonable price. “Our rates will be quite low, because our cost of Gigahash production will be far lower. We can afford to really have our products discounted,” he says.  This price point will be important, because Iyengar needs the money from pre-orders for preproduction. He has raised $1.5 million from angel investors based in Europe and the US, but he wants around $4 million to get his first chips off the production line.  He is developing units targeting a broad audience, and says that there will be a single-chip box with a 500 Gigahash/sec rate for lower-end customers. ""There are some high-end miners that want to pack a lot of hash power into a single box,"" he says, adding that he can provide 2 Terahashes/sec in a box.  ""We want to keep a balance in the market. We don't want to screw up the small miners, because they are a priority in our minds,"" he says. That said, he will be selling chips and boards to OEMs, in the second half of Q4, as they become available.  Earlier this week, Cointerra announced a partnership with Open-Silicon, calling it an ""ASIC design and development partner"". Open-Silicon won't actually be doing any of the chip design, but it will be 'taping out' the final design for Cointerra before it goes to fabrication partner and AMD spinoff GlobalFoundries.  Taping out involves producing the final photomask that will be used during the production process. It's the end of a massive design process, punctuated by an expensive production cycle, and it explains the high barrier to entry for ASIC design. Producing this stuff isn't easy, which is no doubt partly why other companies have had their problems.  The question is whether Cointerra can pull off its claim of 500 Gigahashes per second on a single chip. It's unprecedented, and far beyond the performance of anything else we've been promised. Stranger things have happened - but then, companies in the ASIC space have also made bold claims before, and been forced to backpeddle later.  While Cointerra does its work, the bitcoin network is doing its own – and more of it. In the five weeks since the end of June, the network hashrate has more than doubled. The difficulty is going to skyrocket as these new 28 nm ASICs come on stream – we’ll be watching when KnCMiner begins shipping, to see how much it spikes.  Right now, if you order a unit from KnCMiner, you're getting it in October, the company says. You can't even order from Cointerra yet, unless you are a volume customer.  Which leaves one important question: Is it better to be best, or to be first?",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2013/08/08/cointerras-500-gigahash-per-chip-bid-to-change-asic-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/35502d82286884f3a9fdc05b8c738e8c42afd7f7-800x500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376574,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6W30N,1375957481,Raspberry Pi-powered briefcase converts loose change into bitcoin,"Hackers at the Defcon hacker conference in Las Vegas were recently seen offering bitcoin for sale via a robotic briefcase. People could simply walk up and put their loose change into the coin slot and in return they received a QR code printed on till receipt paper that they could use to redeem their bitcoins.  The hacker minding the briefcase, going by the name Garbage, spoke to The Verge and told them that the bitcoin-serving briefcase had been made to increase awareness of bitcoin. The briefcase itself reportedly cost $250 to build and was driven by a Raspberry Pi computer, with a mobile 4G modem, and was powered from a mains socket on the outside of one of the convention buildings.  The briefcase offered an easy way for passers-by to get involved in digital currency, without having to make a major or time-consuming investment. The machine checked the current rate on Mt. Gox before processing the transaction.  The briefcase represents a similar notion to Lamassu's Bitcoin ATM, which was seen at the Bitcoin London event earlier this year. Zach Harvey, co-founder of Lamassu, believes that the kind of physical and real-world experience the bitcoin briefcase offers is important for newcomers to bitcoin. ""Experiencing a bitcoin transaction is significantly more powerful than theorising the political and financial advantages of the digital currency,"" he said.  ""The amount itself is less important for the experience, so being able to insert a virtually worthless dime is a great negligible-risk start for the bitcoin-curious.""
