This new series will take a look at some of the primary hurdles that altcoins face today. Emerging Projects: Overcoming Challenges Throughout this series we&apos;ll be thinking about small-cap, yet to emerge coins. BTC and ETH have gone full-fledged mainstream, and now there have been a fairly abundant amount of emerging cryptocurrencies that have clawed their way to the most &apos;accessible&apos; exchanges, such as Coinbase, Binance, etc. Accordingly, the so-called &apos;Coinbase effect&apos; in crypto is very much a real thing, and there are some obvious reasons for that: most notably, wide stream visibility and accessibility.

42376338,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AAvv,1628283193,Ethereum Burns 36% of New Coin Issuance Over 2 Days,"Since the activation of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559, the network has removed from circulation, or “burned,” over 5,000 ETH, worth roughly $14 million. This represents 36% of total new coin issuance over the same time period.      Average fees on Ethereum have increased slightly since the upgrade went live on Thursday at 12:33 (UTC), rising from 0.003 ETH to 0.005 ETH. In addition block sizes, measured on Ethereum in units of gas, have been trending as anticipated toward the block gas target of 15 million gas.      At first glance, EIP 1559 seems to be working effectively, burning fees and pricing block space on Ethereum dynamically so that block sizes on average hit a healthy target. However, upon closer examination, there is evidence that EIP 1559 may not be so effective in its main aim to make fees on the network more predictable for users.    Read more: What Crypto Analysts Are Saying About the Ethereum Hard Fork  Block size variation    Under EIP 1559, blocks being mined on Ethereum oscillate dramatically from being 100% full to empty. The reason for this, according to Tim Beiko, thechair of the bi-weekly All Core Developers meeting, is because the pool of transactions eligible to be included in a block gets smaller and larger depending on the minimum fee, or “base fee,” decided by the network.      “Say you have a block that raises the base fee because it’s full,” said Beiko in an interview with CoinDesk. “It’s possible that by the time the next block shows up, there’s just not been that many new transactions who are willing to pay this higher price.”      Pseudonymous Ethereum user “Face Shaver” called this a “misalignment of incentives” that can lead to a number of problems, first and foremost being a lack of fee predictability and stability for the average user.      “It’s not that easy for the average user to predict what the fee will be for the next one or two minutes,” said Shaver in an interview with CoinDesk. “If you are [trying] to get in, either in this block or the next block, the most [fee] volatility you face is ⅛ of the current base fee, but if you think of the average user as someone who is price sensitive, and so is willing to wait one, or even something like three minutes for their transaction to go through ... then you have to consider what happens to the fee in next three minutes.”    Read more: Ethereum’s Hotly Anticipated ‘London’ Hard Fork Is Now Live    Anticipating what the optimal transaction fee on Ethereum will be in three minutes or more is just as difficult with EIP 1559 as it was before EIP 1559, according to Shaver and Beiko. EIP 1559 helps price transactions for users in the moment, but it does not help users predict or anticipate what fees will be in the next moment because the supply and demand dynamics for block space fluctuate with each block.      According to Beiko, such oscillations impacting block sizes and base fees were always expected from EIP 1559. However, Beiko argues the average user can still benefit from knowing the optimized base fee of sending a transaction on Ethereum in the moment, without having to guess or anticipate fees of future blocks.    Incentivizing volatility and Ethereum burns    Savvy users will be careful not to spend more in fees than absolutely necessary.      If users are confident that fees will increase during the next block, there is a financial incentive to include more transactions in the current block than the next. However, if users are confident that fees will decrease during the next block, there is a financial incentive to include more transactions in the next block than the current one.      These natural oscillations between heavy and light blocks, according to Mojtaba Tefagh, assistant professor at Sharif University of Technology, may mean the amount of gas used in each block will trend over the long term above the block gas target, which can create difficulties for network node operators responsible for propagating and maintaining transaction data.      “If the variability in block size is high, people can send more transactions, on average. So if you just adapt the extreme oscillation of alternating between a full block and also an empty block, you can spend much more gas than the target and still the [base fee] would not go up,” said Tefagh in an interview with CoinDesk. “We are incentivizing people to create volatility and as they create volatility, we let them spend more gas.”      For now, both developers and researchers like Moj are taking a wait-and-see approach to assess the full impacts of EIP 1559 on the usability of Ethereum for users and dapps.      According to blockchain analytics firm Dune Analytics, over 90% of transactions on Ethereum have not leveraged the benefits of EIP 1559 two days into the upgrade's activation.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING | RESEARCH | FORKS,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/08/06/ethereum-burns-36-of-new-coin-issuance-over-2-days,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/61748824ff10345fa667a873f5b6fd9c997664db-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376342,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AB0x,1628281849,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Rallies Above $42K as Bull Market Continues,"Bitcoin (BTC) rallied near $43,000 on Friday as short positions continue to unwind from the second quarter sell-off. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value is up about 1% over the past week compared to a 17% gain in ether (ETH) over the same period.      Some analysts are optimistic about the broad crypto rally and see further upside, especially for ETH. On Thursday, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain rallied past $2,600 as the network's latest hard fork upgrade, dubbed “London,” officially went live.      “A mood of optimism appears to have returned to cryptocurrency markets,” wrote Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Bitfinex, in an email to CoinDesk. “Still, the turbulence that we’ve seen in crypto markets over recent weeks is unlikely to subside.”    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $42,815 +4.53%  Ether (ETH) $2,924.1 +4.57%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4436.5 +0.17%  Gold: $1761 -2.41%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.309%, compared with 1.219% on Thursday.    “BTC is also showing strength, which is expected to carry on next week, as it broke out of a downtrend today which dated all the way back to the previous all-time highs in April,” wrote Marcus Sotiriou, trader at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, in an email to CoinDesk.      From a technical perspective, bitcoin’s rally above $42,000 is an encouraging sign. Friday’s strong price action is an attempt to break above the intermediate-term downtrend, which, if confirmed, could yield further upside towards $50,000 to $55,000 resistance.      “The market has been oversold for quite some time,” said Kevin Kang, founding principal of crypto hedge fund BKCoin Capital, in an interview with CoinDesk. “I think we are resuming the bull market in the coming months.”    Ether bullish activity    The bulk of ether options activity has been concentrated in the higher strike, longer duration calls, or bullish bets.      Data provided by Switzerland-based Laevitas shows ether volumes on Deribit, the largest crypto options exchange, have increased by more than 50,000 ETH to 153,000 ETH ($424 million) in the past 24 hours. That takes it to the highest level since the end of May. On Deribit, one ether options contract represents 1 ETH.      Overall, call options have registered higher activity than puts, and the most popular options have been calls expiring March 2022 with strike prices of $50,000 and $40,000, wrote CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole.      Recent bullish activity surrounding the Ethereum network upgrade contributed to ether’s outperformance relative to bitcoin, albeit with greater volatility. The chart below shows that ether tends to be more volatile than bitcoin.    Bitcoin transaction volume    Bitcoin’s total transfer volume (entity-adjusted) has grown to $7.48 billion a day over the past 14 days, indicating greater activity on the blockchain as the cryptocurrency’s price rises, according to Glassnode.      Transactions over $1 million in size, which represent roughly 46.5% of total transaction volume, were rising, Glassnode noted.      “Entity-adjustment” is a methodology Glassnode developed to measure on-chain volume that actually changed hands. “Entities are defined as a cluster of addresses that are controlled by the same network entity and are estimated through advanced heuristics and Glassnode's proprietary clustering algorithms,” Glassnode wrote. (Read more here.)    LINK, MATIC, ETH volumes rise    There has been a steady increase in LINK’s volume on Coinbase, according to the exchange. The number has grown by 35% since the protocol released its smart contract kit v0.10.10 on July 25, which includes full support for Optimism. The volume in MATIC declined this week.      Meanwhile, on Aug. 4, one day ahead of EIP 1559, ether’s volume outpaced that of bitcoin by 61%.    Altcoin and DeFi roundup  Binance Smart Chain Beats Ethereum by Some Metrics: In the latest episode of blockchain competition, Binance Smart Chain, the public blockchain supported by Binance, the world’s biggest centralized crypto exchange by trading volume, surpassed the Ethereum blockchain in daily transactions, again. BSC previously flipped Ethereum on the number of transactions because of the success of PancakeSwap, a decentralized exchange on BSC that was popular in the midst of the decentralized finance (DeFi) craze. This time, however, Binance’s success came thanks to a relatively little-known game on BSC called “CryptoBlades.”  SEC Charges So-Called DeFi Company for Allegedly Fraudulent $30M Offering: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged what it described as a decentralized finance lender, Blockchain Credit Partners (d/b/a DeFi Money Market), and two of its top executives for raising $30 million through allegedly fraudulent offerings. The case is the agency’s first involving securities using DeFi technology, according to the SEC.

Brooks confirmed in an email to CoinDesk that his account was not hacked. In the tweet, Brooks cited ""differences over strategic direction"" between him and his colleagues.  Before joining the U.S. arm of the Binance global crypto exchange, Brooks helmed the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the regulator for national banks, under U.S. President Donald Trump.  Brooks' hiring appeared to have been part of a strategy by Binance.US and its parent to improve their standings by hiring well-regarded former regulators from around the world. Now, Brooks' abrupt departure, along with last month's similarly unexpected departure of the director of Binance Brazil after only six months, is bound to raise questions as regulatory scrutiny of the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume and its various subsidiaries has only intensified. In recent months, multiple countries including the U.K. and Japan have taken action against Binance.  Read more: State of Crypto: Binance Is Firmly in the Regulatory Crosshairs  In a statement, Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao (Binance.US' chairman) said he is ""confident in Binance.US's business and its commitment to serve its customers.""  Brooks' departure, CZ added, would not affect Binance.US customers ""in any way.""  Neither he nor Brooks elaborated on why they parted ways. No word on a successor, even an interim one, either.  ""Brian's work for Binance.US has been invaluable and we hope he will continue to be an integral part of the crypto industry’s growth, advocating for regulations that move our industry forward,"" Zhao said in a separate statement provided to CoinDesk. ""We wish him the very best in his future endeavors.""  That well-wishing contrasted with the way Binance.US dealt with Brooks' predecessor Catherine Coley; the exchange didn't even mention her when it hired Brooks in April.  During his time as acting comptroller of the currency, Brooks pursued an aggressively crypto-friendly reform agenda and met often with members of the digital asset industry – from corporate CEOs to bleeding-edge entrepreneurs from the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.

Google Cloud and Chainlink have been collaborating since 2019 to allow Chainlink to incorporate Google Cloud data.  Chainlink pipes in data from Google Cloud’s Big Query, which hosts weather data from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other sources.  “The reason weather data is important is because it powers decentralized insurance around weather,” Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov told CoinDesk.  The Google integration with Chainlink uses an oracle node that continuously sends data from the outside world into the Chainlink network, where it is then merged and made available in aggregated form for blockchain applications.  “Unexpected adverse weather events lead to economic losses across a wide range of industries, and these events are becoming more common as we experience climate change,” noted Allen Day, a Google spokesperson, in a blog post.

42376337,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AAxB,1628277852,What Warren Buffett Misses About Valuing Digital Assets,"It has been argued that digital assets have no intrinsic value because they are not tied to cash flows, as in a conventional corporation. The argument is essentially that digital assets are a post-modern investment class where value is merely relative to what other people speculate the value is. That is, the only use for digital assets is speculation.      This seems true if you measure digital assets in relation to the standard of the conventional neo-classical finance, the Benjamin Graham/Warren Buffett thesis of valuation. Buffett famously missed out on investing in technology companies early because they lacked ""fundamental value.""    Anthony Morley is a research analyst and founder of Intrinsic Value Company. A version of this post first appeared on Substack. Crypto Questioned is a forum to discuss the ideas and philosophies that drive the cryptocurrency industry.    The problem with discovering the intrinsic value of digital assets is that there is no accepted standard of intrinsic value for digital media in general. Only once we know that, can we know the intrinsic value of digital assets in particular. That is the problem this essay will attempt to solve.      Even the successful digital media companies that came after the dot-com boom show severe inefficiencies and coordination failures including: monopoly concentration, censorship, privacy concerns, the fragmentation and polarization of society, and the mental and physical health issues resulting from gamification and addiction.      These are economic inefficiencies and cultural problems that demand a solution and present an opportunity for economic and social gain. Even though large technology companies have became massively successful, the core problem of their fundamental value remains unresolved.      Let us consider the Benjamin Graham/Warren Buffett model of fundamental valuation. In essence, it says:    Low price/high cashflows = good fundamental value investment    It can basically be assumed that,    Low price = inefficient aggregation of publicly available informationHigh cashflows = high customer demand / low product supply    Now, let us consider: Why doesn’t digital media fit into this fundamental valuation model?      The product that digital media produces is data, massive quantities of data. Data only becomes valuable when it is limited in supply. But the current fundamental valuation model does not distinguish valuable data from its opposite (neither does the efficient market hypothesis). Therefore, there is no economic consensus on what constitutes valuable data.      The implicit consensus is that valuable data is defined by the market price. But this does not make sense either, because price is only a small subset of all valuable data. Valuable data must also include natural human communication that makes market activity possible. If price is only a small subset of valuable data, then saying it determines what is valuable is circular, if not absurd.    Read more: The Art of Scarcity | Aubrey Strobel    Valuable data is what allows for price coordination to happen in the first place. Because we haven't come to a consensus about what that means, there is no way to understand how data is limited in supply, and therefore therefore no way the price mechanism can coordinate productive activity.      This may explain why our economy and culture have been so confounding since digital media became predominant; we are still trying to use price mechanisms to coordinate production of valuable data, even though valuable data is what causes price coordination.      Google, Facebook, Twitter all “produce” valuable data to sell. But the valuable data they sell is actually created by their users through extensive hours of uncompensated communication labor. People chat online while technology companies extract rents and earn free profits. In this kind of economy, the actual content of the data does not matter, only price or its quantitative proxies; so price or its proxies will incentivize the production of non-valuable data.      Now, with digital assets, the distinction between the users, the platform and the end product (valuable data) is collapsed. The users are the owners and the marketers. In this kind of economy, the content or value of the communications data matters a lot. Digital assets increase in value depending on the engineering, design and community decisions of the platforms they're tied to. In other words, digital assets represent a type of platform-specific communication data.      In 1937's “The Nature of the Firm,” Ronald Coase emphasizes the two forms of coordination admitted by economists, price coordination and internal coordination, within firms. He asks, why isn’t everything organized by the price mechanism? Why do firms exist at all? He answers that there is a cost to using the price mechanism. In many cases, it is less expensive and more productive to coordinate internally.      When Coase was writing, internal coordination would have referred to businessmen in the firm. But in the context of distributed networks, internal coordination is any group of people who collaborate over digital media for a shared goal.    Read more: Can DeFi Stay Decentralized?    Internal coordination is a function of the norms, manners and virtues that precede economic transactions and makes them possible. The better the internal coordination, the more that a digital network grows, because it doesn’t have to rely on price coordination.      This distinction between price coordination and internal coordination shows that there is another layer in the Benjamin Graham/Warren Buffett thesis given above: Internal coordination is what allows price discovery to exist and what solves for inefficiencies, externalities and market failures. Internal and price coordination are in a reciprocal, equilibrium relationship.      Therefore, if the digital asset space is to compete with legacy digital media companies, it has to compete on internal coordination and objective values. It must be shown why digital assets are an objectively better economic system.",NEUTRAL,없음,MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | RESEARCH,Anthony Morley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/06/what-warren-buffett-misses-about-valuing-digital-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aaed3d8c6813c882ddd4aeea6186dede551bc341-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376339,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AAzh,1628273062,Money Reimagined: Gensler's SEC Is the Same Old SEC,"All crypto eyes were on Washington this week as Gary Gensler drew a line in the sand on securities laws and a battle brewed over an infrastructure funding bill that would seek to tax cryptocurrency transactions. We take a look at the first of those stories in today’s main column and the second in “The Conversation.”      One remark the Securities and Exchange Commission chief made about a need for more international harmony and less “regulatory arbitrage” around crypto policymaking provides an interesting framing for this week’s “Money Reimagined” podcast episode, which focuses on Ireland, its tax laws, and how policy differentiation can help smaller countries catalyze ecosystems of innovation.      We chatted with Michael O’Sullivan, the author of “The Levelling,” which describes the post-globalization era, and with Lory Kehoe, director, Digital Assets & Blockchain at BNY Mellon and the founder of Blockchain Ireland.      Have a listen after reading the newsletter.    Gensler dispels wishful thinking    The great disappointment that many in the crypto community felt from Gary Gensler’s speech this week reflected, more than anything, how wishful thinking can trump facts. His letter-of-the-law message that most tokens are subject to securities laws was entirely predictable.      That doesn’t mean people shouldn't be frustrated by the SEC chairman’s online address to the Aspen Institute’s Security Forum, described by crypto legal commentator Katherine Wu as the “the most aggressive and hostile stance re U.S. crypto regulation to date from the SEC.” In fact, it should motivate them to do more to mollify increasingly hostile policymakers in Washington.    You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    The reality is that in sharing his predecessor Jay Clayton’s view that “every ICO I’ve seen is a security,” the new SEC Chief made no substantive departure from what he’d expressed before. I know this because I worked with Gensler at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative, where he would frequently cite the “walks like a duck” test to argue that initial coin offerings seemed to meet the Howey Test for what constitutes a security.      When he was named to this position, Gensler’s experience teaching blockchain classes at MIT fueled excessive hope that the industry would now enjoy a friendlier SEC. But Gensler’s deep knowledge and interest in the technology – including an expressed belief that it holds potential to tackle unfair rent-seeking practices within the legacy financial system – never implied that this seasoned regulator would waiver from a strict interpretation of the facts before him.      You see, the professor-cum-SEC chair was right then, as he is now, that in terms of the SEC’s worldview, token projects involving issuances to investors almost always have the features of a security. Look at them with a regulator’s lens and you’ll see the three unmistakable Howey Test features: an “investment of money” in a “common enterprise” with an “expectation of profit derived from the efforts of others.”      I also believe he’s (mostly) right in arguing – as he did on Tuesday and always did at MIT – that for a new, innovative technology to be impactful at scale it needs to be brought within scope of public policy.    A need for leniency    Where Gensler and I tended to disagree during our time together was on the extent to which regulatory agencies should give latitude to cryptocurrency and blockchain developers for that innovation to thrive. However clear securities laws may be, I believe it’s important that financial innovators be given some time-bound degree of freedom from regulatory risk if they are to have the chance to disrupt the incumbents of the existing financial system.      So, I was especially disappointed on Tuesday that his speech gave zero hints of any compromise on this issue. Gensler made no mention, for example, of SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce’s proposal for a “safe harbor” provision that would give crypto startups a three-year grace period to build and launch their projects before they have to worry about federal securities laws.      Instead, the spirit of his message was punitive, focused predominantly on the risks posed by cryptocurrencies, both to investors and national security, and tapping broad, negative stereotypes to describe those risks. While he alluded to his belief in cryptocurrencies’ potential, Gensler seemed more intently focused on their dangers.      I believe he was motivated by a desire to set the legal record straight. Many startups were given flawed advice that their projects would be exempt from SEC filing requirements. Gensler’s speech brought home that point and made it harder for fee-seeking lawyers to opportunistically tell idealistic founders what they want to hear.      The bigger problem, though, is the second-round political effects of his tough-on-crypto stance. Generalizations without context – such as this one: “to the extent that [crypto] is used as [a medium of exchange], it’s often to skirt our laws with respect to anti-money laundering, sanctions, and tax collection” – pump oxygen into the crypto skepticism growing in Washington.      Gensler’s opinion carries weight in the U.S. capital. He held senior positions in the Treasury Department during the Clinton Administration and as the chairman of the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission under President Obama he oversaw some vital post-financial crisis reforms. His stance will empower the likes of Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who are calling for draconian limits on the industry.    Giving bankers a free ride    Some might argue that Gensler’s statements on ICOs don’t matter. Clayton’s pronouncements and early SEC lawsuits were already instrumental in killing off the hype-filled ICO boom in 2018, which was mostly a good thing. And exchanges have put restrictions in place to prevent U.S. investors from buying many tokens that were deemed in breach.      But Gensler appeared to have a wider focus than those past ICOs. In citing a need to regulate decentralized exchanges, he made it clear the SEC has its sights on decentralized finance (DeFi) and on the various governance tokens that drive it. Whether they are described as “ICOs” or not is irrelevant. That could do a lot of harm to the sprawling, expanding DeFi ecosystem.      A crypto skeptic would say, “Why care about making it harder for crypto developers to get rich?” The answer: because this unique field of permissionless, breakneck innovation offers the greatest opportunity yet to reform an outdated, rent-seeking financial system that excludes billions from the chance to make something of their money. A crackdown on DeFi could kill off one of the most promising areas of financial innovation seen for decades.      It’s infuriating that advocates of stricter rules for cryptocurrencies often argue that startups in this space are “freeriding” because the banks and other institutions they compete with are already complying with strict laws. I say that not because I’m dead against crypto regulation – I subscribe to Gensler’s view that good policy can help the technology grow – but because the comparison grossly misrepresents the different starting positions that financial incumbents and their startup challengers occupy.      The reality is that because compliance is so expensive – many bankers now complain that it’s the biggest burden they face in providing affordable capital to non-high-net-worth clients – it functions as a “moat,” a barrier to entry that prevents smaller players that can’t afford it from taking on the bigger players that can. How is a fresh-out-of-college team of brilliant crypto developers going to come up with a less-onerous lending model, for example, if they can’t come up with the tens of millions of dollars needed to make their project compliant?      All hope is not lost. Much could be done at the legislative level to make it easier for crypto innovators to thrive while still imposing a regulatory framework that appropriately protects investors and maintains financial security. Among the multiple cryptocurrency bills in front of lawmakers right now, some make a decent stab at that.      Now that Gensler has made clear his thinking on the applicability of existing laws to this sector, maybe legislators can create carve outs from those laws that better achieve that innovation-versus-regulation balance.      Or maybe that, too, is wishful thinking.    Off the Charts: Bitcoin volumes surge. Why?    Well, that’s odd.      On-chain data show a huge surge in the dollar value of transactions over the Bitcoin network last Sunday, so much that the daily tally – coming in at a noteworthy $69.69 billion – was second only to May 28 of this year.      As Bitcoin Market Journal’s Mati Greenspan wrote in his newsletter on Monday, what’s strange is that these high on-chain volumes were out of sync with relatively thin summer trading on crypto exchanges, where most transactions take place, and with a “completely empty” mempool, which reflects outstanding bitcoin transactions awaiting confirmation. What’s more, the total number of on-chain transactions “was well below average, and the number of unique addresses used was the lowest it’s been since 2016!,” Greenspan wrote.      As Greenspan noted, there were clearly some bitcoin whales moving large amounts of funds around. Why? We don’t know. The question is whether it’s a precursor for greater volume in the market.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Michael J.

42376327,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AAjL,1628271240,The US Senate Goes to War Over Crypto Taxation,"The fight in the U.S. legislature over new cryptocurrency tax-reporting requirements in the Biden Administration’s huge infrastructure bill has continued to get weirder. After industry objections to a flawed initial proposal, there are now two competing amendments about how to scale back its demands. According to the Washington Post, the dispute is now holding up the entire $550 billion bill.      We’ll get into the details but first, take a moment to reflect here. For those of us who’ve been around a while, the fact that anything crypto-related has become the linchpin of such a key piece of legislation is a huge landmark, especially given the technology is only a decade old.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Now quit patting yourself on the back, because I think the house may be on fire.      The whole thing started last week when legislators added new reporting requirements for cryptocurrency brokers as part of the “pay-for” of the infrastructure bill. But the language was so broad and flawed it could have roped in cryptocurrency miners, software developers and other entities who are clearly not “brokers” in any meaningful sense. To be clear, the objection to the provision wasn’t that it would impose taxes on crypto, but that the reporting requirements were technically flawed.      Things seemed to take a turn for the better on Wednesday when Senators Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wy.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) filed an amendment refining and scaling back the rule’s definition of a broker, including carve-outs for node validators (miners), software developers and wallet developers. That amendment, though not perfect, received widespread praise from industry figures including CoinShares Chief Strategy Officer Meltem Demirors and Jerry Brito, of lobbying group Coin Center.      From that moment of hope, the situation has rapidly degraded.      A second proposed amendment to the tax was introduced last night by the provision’s original authors, Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Mark Warner (D-Va.), joined by Kristen Sinema (D-Ariz.). University of Chicago tax specialist Daniel Hemel reviewed the two proposals last night and concluded the main difference is the Warner-Portman-Sinema amendment is narrower. It specifically protects proof-of-work miners and wallet developers, but not protocol developers.    Read more: ‘Cautiously Optimistic’: Crypto Brings Lobbying Muscle to Infrastructure Debate | Opinion    As Hemel observed, it seems very weird the U.S. government would write legislation favoring proof-of-work mining (e.g., bitcoin), given the widely acknowledged need to at least explore more environmentally friendly consensus algorithms. It certainly contradicts SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s recent commitment to be “technology neutral.” Not that Gensler has any formal power in this process, but you might think he had a bit of influence as a well-informed regulator.      I’m speculating here, but the proof-of-work carve-out might be based on a misapprehension that PoW is somehow inherently and uniformly more decentralized than proof-of-stake systems. Based on the language in the draft, there’s also another, funnier possibility. The Portman-Warner-Sinema tweak creates a carve-out for entities “validating distributed ledger transactions through proof-of-work (mining).” One way to read the line is that someone thinks “proof-of-work” and “mining” are the same thing.      To be clear, I find that funny in a very bleak and depressing way.      The worse news is that support for the still-basically broken Warner-Portman-Sinema version of the amendment is worryingly strong. The White House has issued a statement in support. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has reportedly been lobbying for the bad version, too. That would seem to back rumors that Treasury had been involved in crafting the original language, perhaps as a shortcut to imposing reporting requirements on which it had already been working.    Read more: Everything Moves Fast in DeFi, Even Political Action | Opinion    Meanwhile, the generally high-pressure environment around the bill leaves little time for nuanced debate and education. A vote on the full bill is now expected on Saturday.      There will be new, tiny-yet-crucial developments on the provision today, probably before I even publish this piece. Figures including Senator Lummis are calling for public pressure to support her version of the provision, and that may be the most important factor in what happens next. So if you feel strongly about this, call your senator. This tool from Fight for the Future makes it easy (h/t to Meltem).      I’ll just close by again pointing out how mind-boggling – and dare I say, big-picture bullish – is the situation. This huge bill is one of the signature pieces of legislation for the new Biden Administration, one of the things that is expected to cement some kind of larger legacy. And it’s being disrupted by an extended fight over magical internet money.      In other words: We made it, fam.

El proyecto de ley, que fue presentado el martes por el senador Juan Sartori, busca brindar ""seguridad jurídica, financiera y fiscal en los negocios derivados de la producción y comercialización"" de las criptomonedas.      ""Los activos virtuales o criptoactivos serán reconocidos y aceptados por la ley y aplicables en cualquier negocio jurídico. Se considerarán un medio de pago válido, sumado a los incluidos en la ley de inclusión financiera siempre que cumplan con las normas que la ley y la norma reglamentaria prevea"", dice el proyecto.    Read this article in English.    La propuesta de Sartori establece que las criptomonedas ""son productos de libre venta por aquellas entidades e individuos que lo deseen comercializar"", y establece que cualquier persona física o jurídica comprendida en la ley ""podrá recibir y/o enviar fondos en moneda de curso legal desde y hacia sus propias cuentas bancarias propias o de empresas con licencias otorgadas bajo la presente ley"".      Sin embargo, el proyecto de ley no contempla la inclusión de criptomonedas como de curso legal dentro del país, dijo Sartori a CoinDesk.      Si el proyecto se convirtiera en ley, el gobierno emitiría una primera licencia que permitiría a las empresas comerciar con criptoactivos en exchanges, una segunda licencia permitiría ""almacenar, guardar o custodiar criptoactivos"", mientras que una tercera se utilizaría para emitir criptoactivos o tokens de utilidad con ""características financieras"".      Según el proyecto de ley, el Poder Ejecutivo uruguayo otorgaría las licencias a las entidades que cumplan con la Secretaría Nacional para la Lucha contra el Lavado de Activos y el Financiamiento del Terrorismo (Senaclaft) y el Banco Central del Uruguay. Para el resto de las operaciones, la ""utilización de todos estos instrumentos será libre y no requerirá consentimiento, permisos o licencias previas"".      El proyecto de ley de Sartori también estipula la regulación de la minería de criptomonedas. Los mineros no necesitarían una licencia especial, pero sí permisos del Ministerio de Industria, Energía y Minería de Uruguay para poder operar.      La medida también incluye la ""capacitación técnica de los ingenieros eléctricos, civiles e informáticos en la generación de activos virtuales"".      Según el proyecto de ley, la Senaclaft llevará un registro de prestadores de servicios de activos virtuales y de aquellas personas físicas o jurídicas que deseen realizar actividades de generación y comercialización de activos virtuales.      Sartori pertenece al gobernante Partido Nacional y por ese partido se presentó como precandidato a presidente de Uruguay en 2019.

42376336,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AAtP,1628266763,Rising Ether-Bitcoin Price Ratio Shows Crypto Risk Appetite,"Crypto investors have thrown caution to the wind, as evidenced by the recent rise in the ether-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) price ratio, and the trend looks set to continue.      ""ETH/BTC shows a bullish breakout, and that’s a sign of market-wide risk-on where alternative cryptocurrencies tend to outperform BTC,"" Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner at Fairlead Strategies, said.      Some crypto investors see bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency by market value, and stablecoins as safe-haven assets within cryptocurrency markets – a go-to place during times of stress similar to Japanese yen, Swiss franc, or U.S. Treasurys in traditional markets. After all, bitcoin is the biggest cryptocurrency by market value and most liquid market in the digital-asset space along with stablecoins like tether.      Meanwhile, ether and alternative cryptocurrencies are seen as relatively risky bets similar to growth-sensitive assets like copper, gold, stock markets, Australian dollar.      So a rising ETH/BTC could reflect improved risk appetite in crypto markets. That has been the case in the past and in recent weeks.      For example, bitcoin rallied 12% last week but underperformed almost all crypto sub-sectors, including non-fungible tokens and Web 3.0 tokens. During the same timeframe, ETH/BTC rose over 3%. A similar action was seen from the mid-April to mid-May period.      On Thursday, ether-bitcoin jumped to a two-month high of 0.073, confirming a descending triangle breakout on the daily chart.      The breakout indicates that the consolidation has ended, and the bigger bull run from March lows near 0.03 has resumed.      ""ETH/BTC has broken out of a two-month consolidation given recent strength in ether,"" chartered market technician and CoinDesk reporter Damanick Dantes said. ""It's a bullish continuation pattern. Next resistance is seen around 0.8.""      In other words, ether and other altcoins could continue to outshine bitcoin in the near term. The technical picture gels well with the narrative that the crypto market is evolving, with investors beginning to bypass bitcoin and going directly into other industry sub-sectors.      The path of least resistance for ether-bitcoin appears to be on the higher side in the wake of the London hard fork implemented on Thursday.      ""The notion of ether becoming a deflationary cryptocurrency in the future is now tangible, and the effects on Ethereum’s valuation could be profound,” Martin Gaspar, research analyst at CrossTower told CoinDesk.      With the hard fork implemented, Ethereum now burns a portion of the fees paid to miners, thereby causing a net reduction in the issuance. For example, the blockchain has already burnt or destroyed more than 5,000 ETH since the upgrade took effect Thursday, offsetting about 40% of the 12,000-plus coins mined during the period.

Hertford is a privately held company that provides a wide range of financial management services.  The deal gives Sphere 3D a six-month exclusive right to some of Hertford’s bitcoin mining agreements.  Toronto-based Sphere 3D Corp. said it has completed its first agreement and bought 60,000 new bitcoin mining machines. Delivery will start in November and take 10 months.  Other milestones in the contract include the purchase of an additional 160,000 mining machines and securing a long-term contract for a 200,000-square-foot crypto mining facility.  While the company didn’t give a value for the transaction, it said it will issue 4.5 million shares to Hertford once those two targets are achieved.

42376313,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A7pR,1628260216,"German Crypto Startups Welcome $415B 'Spezialfonds' Law, Even if the Impact Is Small So Far","In July, Germany took a major step in the crypto space by passing a law that allows so-called spezialfonds (special funds) to allocate up to 20% of their capital in crypto assets. Considering Germany is among the biggest economies in the world and its capital, Berlin, has been named the cryptocurrency capital of Europe by industry leaders, the news would seem to be significant.      If the spezialfonds, which include insurance companies and banks, were to allocate all 20% of the allowable allocation, that would add up to a remarkable $415 billion, or “quite a big piece of the pie,” as Clemens Schuerhoff, chairman of financial consulting firm Kommalpha, describes it.    Read more: German Law Allowing $415B Investment Into Crypto Takes Effect    “The law change is a big win for crypto and blockchain proponents in Europe and around the world, as the introduction of such a large pool of institutional money to the sector will be profound,” Philipp Pieper, co-founder of Swarm Markets, a German decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, wrote in an email.      But that prospect seems a long way off. While the new legislation could lead to an eventual boom in the market, for now most spezialfonds are still getting acquainted with the industry rather than seriously considering it an investment.      “There are some investors that will do some trial investing but that’s all. I’m pretty sure that there will be no large investment or allocation in the foreseeable future,” Schuerhoff said.      Spezialfonds are wealth and institutional investment fund managers like banks, insurance companies and corporates. They are highly influential but notoriously traditional and conservative – two characteristics that don’t usually align well with the modern, high-risk crypto industry.      “We come from a very traditional point of view and not only the volatility of bitcoin is an obstacle,” Schuerhoff said.      The new law, which was approved by the parliament in April and went into effect on July 1, has been touted as the first step for Germany to become a crypto leader after years in which many companies moved instead to so-called Crypto Valley in Switzerland and to Liechtenstein, which are known for their legal stability and favorable tax laws.      “Germany wants to be a leader but it’s not happening,” says Fabian Pohl, co-founder of Pacta, a Berlin-based blockchain startup. Other countries are more advanced.    Lack of clarity    Industry players complain about a lack of clear and quick responses from the German government regarding the legality of new projects.      “There’s a very slow response time of the watchdog [the BaFin],” Germany’s equivalent to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision, says André Eggert, chief legal officer at Neufund, a Berlin-based blockchain startup with headquarters in Liechtenstein. “Setting up a project and getting it started takes a lot of time because the turnaround takes so long.”      Neufund is part of a group of companies that are incorporated both in Liechtenstein and Germany. Co-founder and CEO Zoe Adamovicz says that while she doesn’t agree that Liechtenstein and Switzerland provide more regulatory simplicity, companies “need to structure themselves across different jurisdictions to optimize for operations.”      Due to lack of regulation, a lot of startups have moved away from Germany. “Now that regulation becomes a bit more clear, most good startups are already out of Germany,” says Prof. Dr. Ingo Fiedler, co-founder of the nonprofit Blockchain Research Lab, in Hamburg.    Read more: Coinbase Receives Crypto Custody License From German Regulator BaFin    The lack of new laws has meant that old laws have been applied to this new industry. Non-fungible tokens (NFT), for example, are not specifically covered by any existing law and therefore, the government applies already existing laws that were passed for other cases on those kinds of assets which reside in inefficient regulation.      “You’re applying the law to something that it hasn’t been made for and that creates a lot of legal uncertainty,” Eggert said.      Another, fundamental obstacle is the fact that the new legislation doesn’t clearly define what is meant by “digital assets.” For that reason, fund managers will rather invest in established assets such as bitcoin or ether to ensure that their investment is covered by the law, Eggert said.      This doesn’t help startups. Their founders believe the legislation could have a positive, indirect effect on startups in the long run, but they don’t expect to receive investments from special funds anytime soon.      “I think we’re going to see an indirect effect [on the startup industry] because knowing that at some point these bigger funds will get engaged and be able to invest in coins at a later stage in time, it makes a lot of sense for early-stage funds to back up these startups today and bring them to a level where they can issue coins and have liquidity in the market,” Eggert said.      There is certainly a possibility for spezialfonds with a specific field of interest, like digital transformation or digitization, or those specifically interested in crypto and blockchain to exhaust the 20% investment opportunity. Others, for example those focused on real estate, might not even touch crypto or blockchain at all, he said.      In general, demand for investments from institutional investors in the space seems to be limited. “No spezialfond will take a double-digit amount and go for bitcoin or large cryptocurrencies,” especially because of the high volatility, according to Schuerhoff.      Some say there is already some action in the market, others say there isn’t, but the bottom line is that there is no data available at this point. A recent survey by TripleA found 2.6% of Germans currently hold cryptocurrencies, with 48% of owners using it to make purchases.      While flashy headlines highlight the potential allocation of $415 billion worth of investments, the new legislation, which also introduced new general guidelines for funds in the country, has a far greater purpose. It exposes Germany to the industry and starts a process of familiarization with cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies so that the country can become a leader in the space again.      “The direct effect on startups is limited, but the indirect effect is substantial,” Eggert said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/06/german-crypto-startups-welcome-415b-spezialfonds-law-even-if-the-impact-is-small-so-far,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/66ef2e799e3dbcd6f97f1a1f8e413fba81ab2263-1087x720.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387430,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXCD0w5,1628257005,Binance Smart Chain Beats Ethereum by Some Metrics Thanks to Latest 'GameFi' Craze,"It wasn’t long ago when every public blockchain attempted to challenge Ethereum’s dominance in the sizzling decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. After Ethereum-based video game ""Axie Infinity"" became an instant success, blockchains have blossomed in the $100 billion gaming industry.      In the latest episode of the blockchain competition – just like what happened with DeFi – Binance Smart Chain, the public blockchain supported by Binance, the world’s biggest centralized crypto exchange by trading volume, surpassed the Ethereum blockchain in daily transactions, again.      BSC previously flipped Ethereum on the number of transactions because of the success of PancakeSwap, a decentralized exchange on BSC in the midst of a DeFi craze. This time, however, Binance's success came thanks to a relatively little known game on BSC called ""CryptoBlades.""      Data from DeFi data tracking firm DappRadar shows that more than 621,000 users were on ""CryptoBlades"" in the past 30 days, while that number for ""Axie Infinity"" is a little above 271,000.      On July 31, Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao tweeted: “#BinanceSmartChain handled 10M+ transactions yesterday. #Ethereum handled 1.2M.”      “#DeFi and #GameFi are growing,” he wrote in a second tweet. And in response to a question whether BSC is ready to handle 20 million transactions per day, Zhao wrote: “Not an expert. But I think we will find out soon enough.”      The series of tweets reflected Zhao’s excitement about crypto gaming’s growth on BSC, as someone who has rarely acknowledged BSC's ambition to challenge Ethereum.      But what is ""GameFi"" and why are blockchains rushing to the sector?      “GameFi,” which combines gaming and DeFi into one word, is the gamification of financial mechanisms where users can earn profits by playing games. Another popular term for this sector is the “play-to-earn” model.      On the surface, the keyword is “gaming,” but at the core, “finance” is what matters the most for blockchains.    Read more: A Play-to-Earn Account Beats a Bank Account    Both BNB, the utility token for Binance and BSC, and BUSD, a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin powered by Binance play an important role in crypto games on BSC.      For example, to buy ""CryptoBlades’"" native SKILL token, gamers must buy BNB first and swap their BNB for SKILL on ApeSwap, a decentralized exchange on BSC. That is a huge boost for BNB demand as well as for liquidity on ApeSwap.      Any transactions made on ""CryptoBlades,"" such as trading game characters and weapons, will require gamers to pay a certain amount of gas fee with BNB.      In an interview with CoinDesk, Samsul Karim, ecosystem coordinator at Binance Smart Chain, said that BNB is used in many crypto games on BSC, but he also emphasized that game developers need to understand that users should be able to choose between different assets – whether it is BNB or BUSD.      Rather than adding financial value to BSC, Karim said that crypto gaming is bringing BSC “culture value.”      “Similar to how you would value an artwork, for example, like that piece of artwork, what is the economic output that it's contributing towards society or any particular economy?” Karim said. “It can't be compared in the same way as a DeFi lending protocol or a bank or something like that. it is producing cultural value.”      An executive from Polygon, a layer 2 product protocol for Ethereum, also appeared to minimize the economic value that gaming brings to Polygon. The India-based product recently launched a unit called Polygon Studios to focus on blockchain gaming and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).      Shreyansh Singh, head of gaming and NFTs at Polygon Studios, said that the usage of MATIC token, the governance token of Polygon, on NFT and gaming powered by Polygon is not intentional; instead, it comes naturally as gamers in Ethereum-based games seek faster, less costly alternatives.      Binance and Polygon are not the only two eyeing the huge potential of a blockchain-based gaming industry.. Other crypto companies and blockchains are also taking big steps in this direction.      Crypto exchange FTX recently announced several NFT gaming-related investments, including a sponsorship deal with decentralized gaming startup Yield Guild Games (YGG).    A perfect match    But to most people in crypto, the combination of gaming and crypto seems like a perfect marriage.      “Crypto has been looking for a mass market use case,” Andrew Tu, an executive at quantitative trading firm Efficient Frontier, told CoinDesk. “Gaming is a sector that people have been hyping up for a long time.

The case is the agency’s first involving securities using DeFi technology, according to the SEC.      Florida residents Gregory Keough and Derek Acree, along with Cayman Islands-based Blockchain Credit Partners have been accused of selling unregistered securities through their company DeFi Money Market (DMM) – mTokens that yielded 6.25% interest and governance tokens that offered voting rights and other perks in DMM’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) – from February 2020 to February 2021.      Though DMM was purportedly decentralized, Keough and Acree’s 50/50 leadership split calls the claim into question. Additionally, the SEC’s order indicates that governance token holders had “no role in running DMM’s core business.”      According to a tweet from DMM’s DAO on Feb. 9th, the company received a subpoena from the SEC in December 2020. Blockchain Credit Partners shut down operations in February and set up a token redemption program that allowed all mToken holders to redeem their tokens for principal and interest owed.      The SEC alleges that Keough, Acree and Blockchain Credit Partners misled investors to believe that investor assets would be used to purchase income-generating assets such as car loans to generate returns for token purchases, and, when they realized that token volatility made this impossible, used personal funds and funds from a separate company to make principal and interest payments for the mTokens.      The respondents agreed to a cease-and-desist order including disgorgement of $12.8 million and penalties of $125,000 for both Keough and Acree. In addition, Keough and Acree will be unable to participate in any offering of a digital asset security for five years.

Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and other senators as part of the bipartisan infrastructure bill, according to a Washington Post report published on Friday.    Yellen spoke with Wyden on Thursday to push back against the attempt to limit a proposal in the bill that would increase federal regulation of cryptocurrencies, according to the publication, citing two people familiar with the matter.  Senators Wyden, Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) proposed their amendment on Wednesday to ensure that miners, node operators, developers and other non-custodial crypto industry participants are exempt from the crypto tax reporting provision.  The White House is officially supporting a competing amendment sponsored by Senators Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio) that excludes proof-of-work miners from the reporting provision.  “We believe that the alternative amendment put forward by Senator Warner, Portman and Cinema strikes the right balance and makes an important step forward in promoting tax compliance,” the White House said in a tweet Thursday evening.  Senators had hoped to pass the bipartisan bill on Thursday night, but debate continued and issues remained unresolved around the cryptocurrency regulations.

42407143,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfEx9S,1628250806,JPMorgan: CBDCs Must Not Cannibalize Commercial Financial Systems,"Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) must not cannibalize countries' commercial financial systems, according to a JPMorgan analyst.    This risk lies in banking customers moving funds from checking accounts to a CBDC account, which could lead to the exodus of as much as 30% of commercial banks' funding base, JPMorgan strategist Josh Younger wrote in a note cited by Bloomberg on Friday.  ""Relatively heavy-handed caps on holdings would be needed to reduce the utility of a retail CBDC as a store of value,"" Younger said in the note.  Younger proposed a limit of $2,500. That would meet the needs of lower-income households without having a major effect on commercial banks' funding mix, given that most such households have less than $1,000 in their checking accounts.  ""If every last one of those depositors were to hold only [a] retail CBDC, it would not have a material impact on bank funding,"" he wrote.  A hypothetical conflict between central banks and commercial banks for consumer deposits is often raised as a risk in the development of CBDCs. Were consumers to place all their funds in an account with the central bank then it would hinder commercial banks' ability to offer loans and mortgages, with a knock-on effect on the wider economy.

42407151,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfExJI,1628249353,"Ether Options Activity Increases as London Hard Fork Goes Live, $50K Call Most Popular","The level of activity in the ether options market is picking up as traders speculate on the impact of Ethereum's London hard fork. The bulk of the activity is concentrated in the higher strike, longer duration calls, or bullish bets.      Data provided by Switzerland-based Laevitas shows ether volumes on Deribit, the largest crypto options exchange, have increased by more than 50,000 ETH to 153,000 ETH ($424 million) in the past 24 hours. That takes it to the highest level since the end of May. On Deribit, one ether options contract represents 1 ETH.      Activity at the over-the-counter (OTC) platform Paradigm has also doubled to 42% of the global market share in the past 24 hours, co-founder Anand Gomes told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""London hard fork is driving this activity, it's mostly institutional,"" Gomes said.      Deribit and Paradigm introduced an institution-focused block-trading service two years ago. Trades facilitated by Paradigm are automatically executed, margined and cleared at Deribit.      Overall, call options have registered higher activity than puts, and the most popular options have been calls expiring March 2022 with strike prices of $50,000 and $40,000.      A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. That means call options offer insurance against bullish moves while puts offer insurance against a price drop.      The data show 12,790 contracts of the $50,000 call expiring in March have changed hands in the past 24 hours. The $40,000 call has seen a volume of 12,520.    Bullish flows    Most of the volume came through Paradigm, where someone, mostly an institution, traded 12,500 contracts of $40,000 and $50,000 calls.      ""There was a flurry of call buying and put selling after the London fork,"" said Darius Sit, CEO of Singapore-based QCP Capital. ""Of particular note was large buying interest in tail strike calls such as a $40,000/$50,000 ETH bull call spreads that were traded with us. A total of 12,500x contracts were traded. We had to take a second look at the screen to make sure those were ETH strikes and not BTC!""      A bull call spread involves buying call options at, below or above the spot market price and selling an equal number of calls with the same expiry at a higher strike price.      In this case, the market participant took the bull call spread by purchasing 12,500 contracts of the March expiry $40,000 call and simultaneously selling 12,500 contracts of the $50,000 call. QCP Capital was the market maker.      The bull call spread is a limited-risk, limited-reward strategy designed to benefit from an increase in the price of an asset. The maximum profit is earned if the asset expires at or above the short call's strike price, that is $50,000 in this case, on the settlement day. Ether is currently trading near $2,750, and would need to surge 1,718% to hit $50,000. The maximum loss is limited to the net premium paid while setting the strategy.      The bullish mood is also evident from the negative one-week, one-, three- and six-month put-call skews, which measure the cost of puts relative to calls.      The data show investors are buying the narrative that the London hard fork implemented on Thursday will curb supply growth over time, yielding a price rally.      According to ethburned.info, around 10,000 ETH have been mined and 4,400 ETH have been burned or destroyed since the hard fork implementation, leading to a net supply reduction of 40%.

Existing Hong Kong account holders have 90 days to close their open positions, the exchange announced Friday.  Earlier in the day, CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao said in a tweet that the exchange would take a more proactive approach to compliance.  Today's news comes shortly after Binance announced it was winding down its derivatives offerings in Europe and ceasing crypto margin trading on sterling, the euro and Australian dollar.  The exchange also recently reduced the maximum leverage users can use to trade futures contracts from 100 times to 20 times.  Regulatory bodies the world over have issued notices or warnings in recent weeks that Binance is not authorized to conduct business in their jurisdictions. These include the U.K., Japan, Thailand and, most recently, Malaysia, where the exchange was ordered to halt its operations July 30.  Also in July, Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said that no entity in the Binance Group is registered to conduct any regulated activity in Hong Kong. The commission expressed particular concern about stock tokens.  Zhao responded to these pressures last month in an open letter in which he described regulatory compliance as a ""journey,"" likening its development to those of the automobile industry where ""laws and guidelines were developed along the way.""  The Binance chief subsequently announced that a new CEO was being sought with a strong regulatory background as his replacement.

The amendment, a copy of which was obtained by CoinDesk, is limited in scope, excluding only proof-of-work mining, or the selling of hardware or software that permits individuals to control private keys that provide access to digital assets.  In a tweet Thursday evening, Jerry Brito, the executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Coin Center, called the amendment ""disastrous."" He added: ""And it does nothing for software devs. Ridiculous!""  The crypto-specific provision would raise $28 billion toward $1 trillion in infrastructure improvements but has been contentious, briefly holding up the entire infrastructure bill.  Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) proposed their amendment earlier Thursday to ensure miners, node operators, developers and other non-custodial crypto industry participants are exempt from the crypto tax reporting provision.  The Biden administration formally supported what it called the ""compromise"" in a statement shared on Twitter late Thursday and attributed to White House Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates.  Wyden tweeted that the competing amendment ""provides a government-sanctioned safe harbor for the most climate-damaging form of crypto tech, called proof-of-work. It would be a mistake for the climate and for innovation to advance this amendment.""  Similarly, Lummis tweeted, ""Our amendment protects miners as well as hardware and software developers. The other does not. The choice is clear.""
