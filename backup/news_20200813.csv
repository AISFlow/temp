According to the SEC’s announcement, between November 2017 and January 2018, Boontech sold $5 million worth of its tokens, Boon Coins, to more than 1,500 investors in the United States, without registering the digital asset with the regulatory body.    The announcement said the firm and Pavithran made false statements about how they had managed to eliminate volatility for their digital asset by using “patent pending” technology to hedge it against the dollar, despite what the SEC said was the complete absence of such a technology.   While the firm and its founder claimed their platform was faster because it was built on a private blockchain, the SEC said these claims were also false and the firm used the same public blockchain as its competitors.   Without accepting or denying the charges, Boontech and Pavithran have settled the allegations by agreeing to disgorge $5 million, plus interest, raised by the token sales. The settlement also requires Boontech destroy all of the Boon Coins in their possession and withdraw them from all digital asset trading platforms.   In addition, the settlement requires Pavithran to pay a penalty of $150,000 and bars him from serving as an officer or director of any publicly traded company.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/13/boontech-founder-pavithran-settle-sec-charges-over-fraudulent-ico-and-registration-violations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/01e4f8b8a9613ff360c98032e1dae3140eeb8c80-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to Thursday’s announcement, fans will be able to collect and trade digital versions of their favorite characters, and battle friends in the Doctor Who: Worlds Apart game.  Trading cards collected by players will be tokenized into non-fungible or unique tokens that cannot be copied, and function as a digital collectible that can be used during the game or be traded between friends.  Just like physical trading cards, there will be rare cards featuring the various doctors, their companions, allies and enemies.  Kevin Jorge, senior producer for Games & Interactive at BBC Studios told CoinDesk via an email that because Dr. Who is one of the most loved and long-running shows on TV, developers will have 56 years’ worth of content to draw from.  Jorge added that the additional security of blockchain technology will also give fans the peace of mind that they are safe from scams and piracy.  “The cards will be ERC721 running on a private fork of ethereum, trading on our own marketplace – but we will eventually be running on interacting with ethereum mainnet so that users can withdraw to 3rd party platforms like OpenSea,” Reality Gaming Group co-founder and tech lead Morten Rongaard told CoinDesk via an email.

That doesn’t mean it’s not moving: Holders of the cryptocurrency are increasingly plowing it into decentralized finance.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $11,543 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 0.50% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $11,274-$11,661  BTC slightly above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish to sideways signal for market technicians.    Little changed in the past day for bitcoin’s price.

Read More: Bitcoin Recovers From $11.3K Despite Losses in European Stocks      However, the state of the options market continues to suggest that traders anticipate a bumpier bitcoin ride over the longer term, according to Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for Swissquote Bank. “Implied volatility has edged higher, but only slightly. This shows that traders are still anticipating another big move, hence preferring long volatility strategies.”      John Willock, CEO of digital asset liquidity provider Tritum, expects bitcoin to move much higher before the year is done, but it will not be a steady upward trend. “There are quite a few psychological barriers to break along the way, especially once we get to $15,000, Willock said. “If our current pace keeps up I could definitely see $16,000 this year,” he added.      Swissquote’s Thomas also said the options market is currently seeing less institutional interest and more individual traders. He noted retail-friendly platform Deribit’s increase in bitcoin options open interest (outstanding contracts) versus more institutional-focused CME’s relative stagnation.      Deribit is an upstart crypto-only derivatives platform, while CME is a trading stalwart used by the biggest financial players for all types of commodities bets. “This shows that institutional players are standing aside, likely preferring to take a summer break,” Thomas said.

The top place for parking BTC in DeFI: Wrapped bitcoin, or wBTC, which allows investors to use the world’s oldest cryptocurrency on the Ethereum network. Over 21,000 BTC is locked in wBTC, by far its largest DeFi use.

42384397,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXIlV,1597350554,Writing Bitcoin Smart Contracts Is About to Get Easier With New Coding Language,"Bitcoin smart contracts are a tricky beast to tame, but a new language is making them easier to write, democratizing them in a sense.      Smart contracts can (among other things) allow users to set extra rules on their bitcoin, requiring these rules be met before the funds can be unlocked. Minsc, created by Bitcoin developer Nadav Ivgi, is a new programming language that makes it easier for developers to create these kinds of contracts so they can build them into bitcoin wallets and other apps more smoothly.      One of the goals of Minsc is to make smart contracts ""more accessible to more people,"" Ivgi told CoinDesk. That means both developers and users alike are able to take advantage of tools built by developers.    Tier one: 'Script' smart contracts    Smart contracts were first described by Nick Szabo in the 1990s. He theorized a way of automating legally binding contracts made between people.      Typical examples of smart contracts on Bitcoin include not allowing 0.1 BTC to be spent until 2021, or requiring more than one person to sign off on a transaction before the money can actually move. Smart contracts also power second layers on the Bitcoin protocol, such as the Lightning Network, which could help Bitcoin expand to reach more users.      Thus far, Bitcoin Script is the language that makes these contracts possible.      The problem is it's tricky to work with Bitcoin Script. It is unlike other, more popular programming languages developers are used to, making it harder to wrap their heads around and compose in. This lack of understanding also makes it easier to make a mistake, potentially putting Bitcoin at risk.      The unwieldiness of Bitcoin Script was one of the factors that led Vitalik Buterin to design the Ethereum platform in the first place. Solidity, Ethereum's first smart-contract language, was designed to be much easier for developers to read and thus use. And it has paid off: Ethereum has grown to become the go-to platform for smart contract developers.      Read more: How Do Ethereum Smart Contracts Work?    Tier two: Miniscript    Miniscript, released in 2019 by Pieter Wuille, Andrew Poelstra and Sanket Kanjalkar at Blockstream Research, chips away at this issue for bitcoin.      Read more: Pieter Wuille Unveils ‘Miniscript,’ A New Smart Contract Language for Bitcoin      ""One reason that we’re not anywhere close to using Script’s full potential is that actually constructing scripts for nontrivial tasks is cumbersome. It’s hard to verify their correctness and security, and even harder to find the most economical way to write things,"" Wuille and Poelstra wrote in a blog post introducing Miniscript in September of last year.      Miniscript offers a language that’s easier to understand than Script, with built-in security guarantees.      Additionally, if there are two different ways of writing the same contract in Script, Miniscript is able to assess which one is ""more economical.""      The computer eventually compiles (or converts) Miniscript to Bitcoin Script, which is what the code ultimately needs to be written in to successfully lock up real bitcoin with these extra restrictions.    Tier three: Minsc    Minsc is the third tier of the cake.

""Minsc’s focus is on usability and making it easier to express, comprehend and reason about scripts, using a simple and familiar syntax.

""Syntactic sugar"" is a programming term for adding into a language another easier, shortcut way of executing a task that is usually harder to write.      So Minsc doesn't add anything new to Script, it just makes it easier to use.

42384395,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXIgT,1597349993,US Postal Service Envisions Blockchain-Backed Mail-In Voting,"The United States Postal Service (USPS) has moved to patent a novel vote-by-mail elections system secured with blockchain technology.    An application published Thursday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and filed by USPS on Feb. 7 envisions combining the ""dependability and security"" of the USPS with blockchain ""to prevent tampering"" of electronic ballots.  Saying in the filing that voters want a ""convenient"" means to access the polls, USPS offers a number of different methods to accomplish this objective.  Among the various ""embodiments"" include: mailing out token-linked QR codes; distributing scannable paper passcodes to a digital voting system; storing voter identification on the blockchain; storing electronic voting signatures on the blockchain; and storing the votes themselves on the blockchain.  Whether any of these proposals could bolster mail-in ballot security or avoid the pitfalls security researchers routinely lob at existing blockchain-backed voting systems was unclear at press time.  Also unclear was the Postal Service's intentions for the patent. A USPS press officer did not immediately respond to questions on whether or when USPS would actually test its methods.  Any change to the United States' patchwork voting systems would almost certainly proceed down to the state and county level.

And, as of yesterday, we have Based Money.      Meet today's decentralized finance (DeFi), in what amounts to a crossover between massive multiplayer online (MMO) games, like World of Warcraft, and crypto pump-and-dump schemes.      These aren't the same DeFi projects launched earlier this summer, said Amentum Capital co-founder Steven McKie. These new projects are about leveraging Ethereum’s tech for unintended uses. They're about making crypto fun again.      They're about making money.      Yam Finance launched Tuesday. By the following day, YAM shot upwards of $160 per token and had some $700 million in no-loss collateral obligations under contract (aka yield farming). Early Thursday morning, YAM entered Github Valhalla when a bug locked the project’s governance and $750,000 treasury. The token’s market cap swiftly lost $60 million in 35 minutes.      Read more: DeFi Meme Coin YAM Succumbs to Fatal ‘Rebase’ Bug, Makes Plans for ‘YAM 2.0’    Playing the game    From first heartbeat to last breath in less than 48 hours. But those are the rules of DeFi’s newest toy, “minimally viable monetary experiments,” as Yam Finance dubbed itself.      “The longer it takes you to do due diligence in this cycle, the lower your alpha,” McKie told CoinDesk in a phone interview. “If you are clued in to play the game, play it. If not, sit out to the next one.”      McKie was an early liquidity provider for Based.Money, another DeFi MMO game (as he likened it to). The project’s anonymous “Ghouls” founding team welcomed its users warmly via Tor:    WE ARE LIVEGET THE FUCK IN YOU DEGENERATES  Play by the rules (even if you don’t know them)    Does the project have a governance structure? Where can I stake collateral to farm? What pool has the best returns?      These are the questions DeFi “degenerates” (or ""degens"") shoot back and forth ad nauseam in various community Telegram and Discord channels.      For YAM, the central rule was “Know thy rebase,” the algorithmic supply dump issued every 12 hours to push the token’s value back toward one dollar. The token was bid up to as high as $167, according to CoinGecko. Traders rushed to take profits before the rebase. After, they pumped the token’s value back up.      Read more: Deposits in ‘Monetary Experiment’ Meme Token YAM Break $460M      Based Money isn’t much different, minus a few rule changes: Farm the BASED token, push the token price up and storm out the door before the algorithm changes the rules.      “The BASED Protocol is a DeFi game of chicken designed to shake out weak hands and yield the highest gains for those who understand the rules,” the website reads.      BASED is trading hands at $128 at time of writing, according to CoinCecko.      DeFi MMO is all possible because of Ethereum’s composable nature, Aave CEO and founder Stani Kulechov said in a recent Chainlink blog. Often analogized to Lego bricks, Ethereum applications can be snapped together to create novel financial projects.      Yield farming makes liquidity just another plastic brick in the box, he said.      Read more: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained      “If that product is good, it will get network effects quickly since liquidity moves in an interoperable fashion as well,” Kulechov said.    DeFi composability    Yet, composability does not translate to product safety, OpenZeppelin security researcher Austin Williams told CoinDesk in an email. Just ask YAM investors.      “It is important to understand, however, that just because a project is composed of code that comes from several other audited projects does not mean that the new amalgamation is safe,” Williams said.      That said, yield farming stands as a better alternative to initial coin offerings (ICOs). Yield farmers are rewarded with a project’s native token for lending liquidity to its market. In other words, you don’t get burnt for swapping fiat for an unproven token.      Read more: Compound’s Approach to DeFi Governance Starts With Giving Away COMP Tokens      It’s not like these projects have not warned users beforehand about the risks, either. Both Yam Finance and Base Money publicly broadcasted that the code banks were unaudited.    In it for the memes (and the money)    This doesn’t make it a smart play, or even a good look, for an industry egg-faced with scams. Those who bought YAM or BASED tokens at retail prices paid for every farmer’s ticket into the arena, crypto blogger Lefteris Karapetsas said Thursday.      “The bad side of farming is the ‘DeFi Chad’ or ‘Defi Degen.’ The kind of meme-driven farmer who jumps from protocol to protocol without any thought on contract safety, chasing the biggest yield, dumping their tokens to the new guys and then moving on,” he wrote.      But it is lucrative for interest-hungry farmers. It’s also really fun.      Read more: DeFi Traders Are Gaming Ethereum for Higher Profits, Researchers Say      “A community that didn’t exist 30 hours ago, through the power of memes and financial incentive alignment, is about to get a higher voter turnout than the U.S. presidential election usually does,” Yam Finance Telegram owner Eric Meltzer said early Thursday morning, referring to a governance vote to save the project.      A shower of “when rebase?” memes and emojis greeted Meltzer's comment. Within hours the whole project was all but bricked.

42384403,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXIrn,1597349387,The Federal Reserve Is Experimenting With a Digital Dollar,"The U.S. Federal Reserve is actively investigating distributed ledger technologies and how they might be used for digitizing the dollar.      Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard said the U.S. central bank has been testing DLT over the past several years to study what a digital currency might do to the existing payments ecosystem, monetary policy, financial stability and the banking sector.      “With these important issues in mind, the Federal Reserve is active in conducting research and experimentation related to distributed ledger technologies and the potential use cases for digital currencies,” Brainard said Thursday at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco’s Innovation Office Hours.      Read more: Senate Banking Committee Remains Open to Idea of Digital Dollar in Tuesday’s Hearing      Brainard cited the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as one issue that reinforced the need for “immediate and trusted access to funds,” noting that recipients of emergency stimulus funds spent them quickly, indicating they urgently needed access.      “The COVID-19 crisis is a dramatic reminder of the importance of a resilient and trusted payments infrastructure that is accessible to all Americans,” she said. “It was notable that after a sharp reduction in spending early in the COVID-19 crisis, many households increased their spending starting on the day they received emergency relief payments.”      The idea of a digital dollar as a tool to distribute emergency stimulus funds is not new. Congress has been kicking the idea around since at least March. However, no concrete public efforts have been made to create a blockchain-based central bank digital currency in the U.S.    Experimentation    U.S. lawmakers have asked Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell about the potential benefits to a digital dollar in the past. The regulator said last November that the central bank is “carefully analyzing” the potential benefits as well as the costs.      At the time, Powell said the Fed was not actively developing a digital dollar, that it might not offer the same benefits to U.S. consumers that other nations’ central bank digital currencies would offer their citizens and that there are questions about privacy and consumer protection.      Brainard echoed these questions in her speech Thursday, but her remarks indicate the Fed is further along in its experimentation than has previously been confirmed.      Read more: US Fed Chair Says Private Entities Should Not Help Design Central Bank Digital Currencies      “To enhance the Federal Reserve's understanding of digital currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is collaborating with researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in a multiyear effort to build and test a hypothetical digital currency oriented to central bank uses,” Brainard said.      The code from these experiments will be published under an open-source license for the general public to experiment with it.    International efforts    Brainard said the existence of other CBDCs and private cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and libra, underscore the need for the U.S. to evaluate cryptocurrencies.      “Digital currencies, including central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), present opportunities but also risks associated with privacy, illicit activity, and financial stability,” she said. “This prospect has intensified calls for CBDCs to maintain the sovereign currency as the anchor of the nation's payment systems.”      She also singled out one country in particular, noting “China has moved ahead rapidly on its version of a CBDC.”      The Fed needs to “remain on the frontier of research and policy development” given the dollar’s role in the world, she said.      Read more: Senate Hearing Sees Digital Dollar as a Tool for Economic Supremacy      Her views have been echoed in the past by former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Chris Giancarlo, who is now a director with the Digital Dollar Project, which has called for tokenizing the dollar. Giancarlo has appeared before Congress three times this summer to advocate this approach.      Like Brainard, Giancarlo has said a digital dollar would benefit the U.S. both in terms of quickly distributing or transferring funds when needed, as well as continue to maintain the dollar’s dominance in the global economy.      Many questions remain before the U.S. can even consider a CBDC, Brainard said Thursday. They include whether a CBDC issued by the Fed would be legal tender under the law.      “A significant policy process would be required to consider the issuance of a CBDC, along with extensive deliberations and engagement with other parts of the federal government and a broad set of other stakeholders,” she said.      “... The Federal Reserve has not made a decision whether to undertake such a significant policy process, as we are taking the time and effort to understand the significant implications of digital currencies and CBDCs around the globe.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | FIAT | REGULATION | WALLET | RESEARCH,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/08/13/the-federal-reserve-is-experimenting-with-a-digital-dollar,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a447942ef0bdf375c3eb6c62292985dd28feac34-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384407,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXIwp,1597339019,"Blockchain Bites: Coinbase's Loans, Ethereum's Fees, YAM's Bug","Ethereum users are paying through the nose while miners profit. Coinbase is offering bitcoin-backed loans and nearly a quarter of the Tor Network may be compromised by a crypto-loving scammer.      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    At stake    Has YAM been mashed?      The memetic token project which launched on Tuesday and crashed on Wednesday – erasing nearly $60 million in value – announced itself to the world as an “experimental protocol mashing up some of the most exciting innovations in programmable money and governance,” in a Medium post.      Liquidity providers piled into YAM tokens, developed by Yam Finance, in an attempt to make a quick profit before catching the hot potato.      Profits would be derived from YAM’s elastic supply schedule, which was programmed to keep the token close to the value of U.S. dollars by creating or destroying tokens at set intervals, called a rebase.      It was this very mechanism that contained a bug that destroyed the harvest, disabling the project’s on-chain governance feature.      The first version of YAM launched as the “second purely decentralized DeFi project after Yearn Finance,” according to Cointelegraph’s Joseph Young. And this position has led to varying opinions about the value of the dead project.      Compound’s Jake Chervinsky tweeted, “This was an extraordinary governance experiment.”      But Avalanche’s Emin Gun Sirer thinks purely speculative projects – “YOLO coins” – detract from DeFi’s attempt to “accomplish things not possible in the traditional finance world.”    Top shelf    Record Fees Transaction fees and miner’s profits are soaring on the Ethereum blockchain. Yesterday evening the average fee per ether transaction reached $6.04, according to Blockchair, the highest level since 2015. Median transaction fees sit near historic highs of $3. The increase in fees and ether’s jump in price has driven the daily profitability of Ethereum miners to levels not seen in 27 months – increasing profit margins for most mining equipment above 90%. Data from BitInfoCharts shows that the daily profitability for Ethereum miner operators is at $5.8 per 100 megahashes second (MH/s) of computing power – a level not seen since early May 2018.      Crypto Credit Line Coinbase will allow U.S. retail customers to borrow fiat loans against as much as 30% of their bitcoin holdings, without filling out an application or going through a credit check. The exchange is setting conservative parameters on the product, according to CoinDesk’s Nathan DiCamillo, capping credit lines at $20,000 per customer and offering an interest rate of 8% for bitcoin-backed loans with terms that are a year or less. Coinbase claims it will keep the bitcoin at the exchange without reinvesting it.      Tokens, Take Two Token sales are back, reports CoinDesk’s Leigh Cuen. Ava Labs, Polkadot and NEAR protocol – all potential alternatives to Ethereum – are among the most prominent crypto projects to raise tens of millions of dollars within the last month. But this isn’t a play-by-play of 2017. Token founders now prefer ongoing sales with controlled distribution conducted over exchanges like CoinList, Gate.io and Binance. Still, not all Layer 1s are interested in token sales. Bram Cohen’s Chia Network recently raised $5 million in an equity round led by Slow Ventures, ahead of an IPO.      Torn Network? A single malicious entity controls 23% of all exit nodes used on the anonymous internet provider Tor Network and is using its position to steal bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, according to pseudonymous cybersecurity analyst ""nusenu."" The Tor Network is a popular way to anonymize web traffic by shielding user’s IP addresses. The hacker is using a position as a major exit relay host to decrypt websites, giving them unrestricted access to traffic passing through their servers. It's unclear how much cryptocurrency has been stolen and whether the malicious agent is engaged in other attacks.      Bitcoin for Business Nigerians are turning to bitcoin to bypass hurdles imposed on trade with China. Business owners and laymen, restricted by banking limitations and sanctions, are using bitcoin for frictionless trade, reports CoinDesk contributor Alyssa Hertig. All this trade with bitcoin is happening behind the scenes. “Businessmen and women on the ground aren’t exactly eager to publicize that they’re using bitcoin for international trade. For one, the legality of cryptocurrency is fuzzy in the region,” she writes.

In the past 24 hours, Uniswap reported $213 million in volume, accounting for more than 60% of all decentralized exchange volume, according to Dune Analytics.      Link Cap Chainlink (LINK) is now the fifth largest crypto by market capitalization, surpassing bitcoin cash (BCH). At press time, LINK stands at $5.76 billion compared to BCH's $5.30 billion in total market value with a 24-hour volume clocking in at $1.05 billion versus BCH's $83.7 million. Market capitalization is a tenuous indicator, found by multiplying the total number of coins or tokens in circulation multiplied by its spot price, but has become the go-to metric to rank crypto projects.

42384405,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXIvZ,1597338973,Mining Firm Hut 8 Reports 28% Drop in Q2 Revenue Following Bitcoin Halving,"Canadian bitcoin miner Hut 8 announced its Q2 2020 earnings Thursday, reporting a sharp drop in revenue. However, the rising value of the firm's bitcoin holdings helped Hut 8 finish the quarter in the black.      The publicly traded company mined 795 bitcoin (BTC) last quarter, a 29% decrease from the 1,116 BTC mined during the prior quarter. As a result, revenue declined 28% to C$9.2 million (US$7 million).      Management mainly attributed this to the bitcoin halving that took place on May 11, writing:    “The network difficulty decreased subsequent to the halving by 15%, but quickly returned back to levels prior to the halving. This posed a difficult challenge to many bitcoin miners as they saw the bitcoin block reward drop by 50% with similar network difficulty rates meaning that revenue dropped by nearly 50% for all bitcoin miners, including Hut 8.”    Despite a C$6.4 million gross loss for Q2, Hut 8 reported C$2.8 million in net income – thanks to a C$9.4 million gain on the re-measurement of its bitcoin holdings. Hut 8 has 2,954 BTC on its balance sheet as of the end of Q2 2020.      The company also noted it had successfully raised C$8.3 million in gross proceeds from its public offering, which closed near the end of the quarter. According to management, the additional capital has already been committed to upgrading its existing mining equipment.      “This upgrade is a big step towards modernizing Hut 8’s equipment and increasing the overall efficiency of its bitcoin mining fleet,” the company said in a statement.

In a press release Thursday, the DOJ announced it had investigated and dismantled ""three terrorist financing cyber-enabled campaigns"" involving al-Qaeda, Hamas and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS).      Legal documents filed Thursday show the DOJ is trying to seize bitcoin from 155 addresses it alleges were used by Al Qaeda to fund terrorism and arrest two individuals allegedly involved with facilitating crypto transfers for Hamas.      In a complaint for forfeiture, the FBI, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and Internal Revenue Service cyber-crimes unit claim that Al Qaeda created a sophisticated money-laundering operation through a network of Telegram channels, which they used to solicit bitcoin donations intended to fund acts of terror.      ""Al-Qaeda and affiliated terrorist groups have been operating a BTC money laundering network using Telegram channels and other social media platforms to solicit BTC donations to further their terrorist goals,"" the complaint read. ""As described below, al-Qaeda and affiliated terrorist groups operate a number of Telegram channels and purport to act as charities when, in fact, they are soliciting funds for the mujahadeen.""      The complaint starts with donations sent to a Telegram group called ""Tawheed & Jihad Media,"" which began soliciting bitcoin donations in April 2019.      Overall, the investigators found 155 different crypto addresses they claim are tied to Al Qaeda and various other organizations allegedly supporting the terrorist group.      Funds were sent to gift card exchanges and other platforms, according to the filing.      ""The Defendant Properties are subject to forfeiture to the United States ... as assets of a foreign terrorist organization engaged in planning or perpetrating any federal crime of terrorism,"" the complaint said.

42384406,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAXIt3,1597328426,4 Myths About CBDCs Debunked,"Although the terminology of central-bank digital currencies (CBDCs) is becoming increasingly confusing, when we talk about CBDCs we’re talking about a type of money with at least three features:    Unlike bank deposits or e-money stored in prepaid cards, it’s a liability of the issuing central bank, not of an intermediary between the central bank and the money user.  Unlike reserve balances held by banks at the central bank, it’s available to any person or business, not just to selected counterparties.  Unlike cash, it only exists in electronic form, never as a physical token.    The CBDC is, thus, a conceptual type of money that hasn’t yet been created, except for some limited prototypes. But myths surrounding CBDCs are already piling up.    The Ecuadorian myth    No, Ecuador wasn’t the first country to issue a CBDC. Ecuador did have a bad experience with a so-called sovereign digital currency, the “Sistema de dinero electrónico,” or electronic money system, launched in December 2014. The official promise was that regular people could open digital accounts at Banco Central del Ecuador (BCE) and, with the help of a cell phone, spend or transfer money deposited in these accounts.    Marcelo M. Prates is a lawyer at the Central Bank of Brazil and holds a doctorate from Duke University School of Law. The views and opinions expressed here are his.    But “money,” in this case, was U.S. dollars, as Ecuador had dollarized its economy in early 2000. So “dinero electrónico” has never been a true sovereign currency digitally issued by the Ecuadorian central bank. “Dinero electrónico” was instead an attempt to create digital dollars. The BCE exchanged U.S. dollar bills and coins deposited by the public for a digital representation denominated in dollars that could allegedly be used by the depositor, with no loss of value, to make payments and transfer funds electronically.      See also: Ajit Tripathi - 4 Reasons Central Banks Should Launch Retail Digital Currencies      The main problem with this monetary scheme was allowing, at least in theory, the BCE to circumvent the dollarization, namely by ditching the parity between the amount available in the digital accounts and the amount of US dollars kept deposited. This concern contributed to public distrust and, ultimately, to the failure of the experiment. Street protests against “dinero electrónico” were common, with people holding signs that read “I don’t believe in your imaginary money.”      During the three years of operation, 400,000 accounts were opened with the central bank, but more than 70% of the accounts were inactive in late-2017. In December 2017, Ecuador’s legislature passed a law ending the digital-currency program, and the central bank was then ordered to close all digital accounts by April 16, 2018.    The token myth    The tokenized CBDC is the second myth. If “tokenized” means using technology to scramble some data associated with the CBDC to transmit or store this information securely, fine. But if “tokenized” implies that a CBDC can or should have cash-like characteristics, we have a problem.      Why would we want a CBDC, or any digital asset for that matter, to mimic a physical object? It seems paradoxical to develop a series of arguments in favor of issuing sovereign money in the digital format – like improving monetary policy and enhancing financial stability – and then conclude this digital money should work as a token. If all we want is a tokenized form of money, we already have cash.    If 'tokenized' implies that a CBDC can or should have cash-like characteristics, we have a problem.    Cash is tokenized money because it carries in itself all the information needed to make a payment or transfer, and the monetary transaction is final when the token changes hands. With cash, the settlement is immediate and bilateral, without any intermediary intervention. It’s truly peer-to-peer. In payments or transfers using CBDCs, the transaction needs to be recorded in a ledger to indicate that some units of CBDC moved from one account or wallet to another. Some intermediation, even if decentralized, is needed for the transaction to be settled. It can’t be peer-to-peer.      It may be technologically feasible to authenticate a certain number of CBDCs that can be verified and accepted as legitimate, even when digital accounts or wallets are offline. But this process can only defer, not avoid, the settlement of the transaction with digital currency. At some point, the balances of the digital accounts or wallets must be reconciled and informed to all those keeping track of the transactions in the network, be they central banks or bitcoin miners. Otherwise, it’s impossible to determine who owns what.      Without reliable records, no one can know for sure whether the units of CBDC you’re trying to spend are really yours or whether you transferred these units from your wallet to another wallet 10 minutes ago. Therefore, the distinction between token-based and account-based CBDCs is particularly artificial. No digital currency, CBDCs included, can be token-based because none can be exchanged without intermediation and record keeping. Only cash can do the trick.    The AML/KYC myth    The third myth relates to the argument that, if central banks are to offer a digital currency to the public, they’ll have to observe anti-money-laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) rules.      AML/KYC rules exist for public authorities to gain access to financial information they wouldn’t otherwise know. Financial institutions were legally enlisted as gatekeepers to help combat illegal activities because they’re the ones with direct access to financial transactions’ records.      Once a public authority, the central bank, is the recipient of the financial information related to transactions conducted through the CBDC digital accounts or wallets, no more record keeping or reporting by third parties is needed. It would then be easier for the public authorities to follow and even restrict suspicious transactions – based, for example, on the amount transferred or the location of the counterparties, impeding transactions outside the sovereign territory.      See also: Central Banks Mull Creating a CBDC, but Not on a Blockchain: Survey      With a CBDC, AML/KYC rules wouldn’t be a matter of private institutions being statutorily required to share information with public authorities. These rules would instead be a framework for institutional collaboration between the central bank and fiscal and law enforcement authorities to inhibit suspicious monetary transactions. If, then, a person or entity wanted to apply for an official digital account or wallet to use CBDCs, the central bank shouldn’t be so quick to deny service on the grounds of “not knowing the customer.”      From countering illicit activities to advancing financial inclusion, the central bank would have good reasons to take as many “customers” as possible, easing initial AML/KYC checks. The collection of information to set up a new digital account or wallet should be kept simple, creating an incentive for anyone to use the official CBDC channels.      If the digital account or wallet were later used for suspicious transactions, the central bank would have the tools to react accordingly: the account or wallet could be temporarily restricted and the potentially illegal action, reported to law-enforcement authorities for further investigation, all subject to judicial review.    The anonymity myth    This assessment of AML/KYC rules doesn’t imply that it’s impossible to have privacy when using CBDCs. With technology and well-designed rules we can build a robust framework for privacy protection with a CBDC. But first, we have to acknowledge, debunking the fourth CBDC myth, that the time for absolute monetary privacy, like secret Swiss bank accounts, is over.      See also: Igor Mikhalev & Kaj Burchardi - Central Bank Digital Currencies Need Decentralization      Start with tech. The individual details of all transactions using CBDC must be encrypted by default and not be available to third parties, public or private. Then add the law. Transactions with CBDCs should be completely anonymous up to a certain amount – say, $3,000 per month. Everyone, even a foreigner, should be able to set up a digital account or wallet and use CBDCs up to that amount, even without producing an official identification. A phone number or email address would suffice.      Over this threshold, presenting some official identification when setting up the digital account or wallet would be required. But all identified CBDC users would have full privacy in their account or wallet, guaranteed by encryption. Monetary privacy would be relative, though, as it could be lifted, and the encryption broken, with a court order and under specific legally defined circumstances.      Finally, violations of these rules should be criminal offenses, resembling the current legal framework, which protects, with much success, fiscal and financial information of individuals and businesses. CBDCs, like any other digital currency, need some kind of validation when transacted and, in turn, will inevitably leave a trail. That doesn’t mean that anyone should be able to see this trail. With technology, legal rules, and judicial protection, monetary privacy with CBDCs can be assured.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Marcelo M.

42432494,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNa7dh,1597327200,Crypto VC Firm Assesses the 'State of Blockchain Governance',"Everyone in crypto has been talking about decentralized finance (DeFi) since bankless lending started to boom in June. But, looked at another way, it's really a governance boom.      Into this environment has stepped Greenfield One, an early-stage venture capital firm that just published a comprehensive new resource on the topic of blockchain governance.      Take, for example, COMP. DeFi has been hot ever since Compound started distributing its COMP governance token on June 15. COMP didn't introduce new features to the product, it just gave users a means to voice how the $777 million lending protocol should evolve.      The report from the Berlin-based Greenfield One looks at this and every notable spin on blockchain governance leading up to the birth of yield farming following COMP's debut.      ""The [Compound] community uses a variant of liquid democracy,"" the report states.      But despite crypto founders' best intentions, the Greenfield One team found blockchain governance schemes tend to get put together fast and then treated with reverence. At times that faith is misplaced.      ""I'm not saying that teams aren't taking governance seriously, but it always feels like something that they build on the side,"" Jascha Samadi, a Greenfield One partner, told CoinDesk in a phone call.      The venture firm often starts working with portfolio companies well before mainnet launch, Samadi said, coaxing them to consider various governance models as early as possible.      Therefore, Greenfield One thought it would be helpful to have an overview of what different groups have tried so far. Since such a guide didn't already exist, the group decided to make one.      ""This is such an important topic that we really just need to raise awareness,"" Samadi said.      The report covers Bitcoin, Ethereum, Decred, Tezos, Cosmos, Polkadot, several DAO frameworks, MakerDAO, Nexus Mutual and Compound.      It also deals with describing the roles of stakeholders seen across blockchains such as miners, validators, users, full-node operators and companies. It deals with strategies for off-chain governance as well as the various questions that can be dealt with on-chain.      Also read: How a DeFi Trader Made an 89% Profit in Minutes Slinging Stablecoins    Larger story    The cryptocurrency industry has a tendency to function as if the world began on Halloween 2008, when Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin white paper, but Greenfield One realized there is a larger literature of organizational theory that applies to cryptocurrencies.      ""Traditionally, scholars have been focused on the firm as the unit of analysis in organizational design, which has become less and less congruent with the emerging patterns of organizing in peer-to-peer networks and on platforms,"" they write.      The report opens its discussion by grounding decentralized technology in a larger conversation about how humans get things done together, such as through firms or nations.      ""From an institutional perspective, blockchains can be viewed as a new coordination technology competing with firms, markets and national economies as institutional alternatives organizing the economic actions of groups of people,"" the report states.      This alternative first manifested with Bitcoin.      But not everything Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency networks need can be sorted out on-chain. ""By far not all activities are reliably traceable and automatically verifiable on public blockchains (especially human labor, where some subjectivity in quality is involved),"" the authors write. Thus the need for ""residual control,"" that is human-powered governance.      Also read: Token Sales Are Back in 2020      ""The deeper we dug we realized that it's such a broad and vast topic,"" Samadi told CoinDesk. ""Before we dive into how to best or most effectively govern we need to understand what blockchains are in a broader sense of organizational theory.""      Cryptocurrency may be moving Earth toward the singularity, but humans are still key to the project for the foreseeable future.

Major European equity indices like Germany’s DAX and U.K.’s FTSE are down 0.30% and 1%, respectively., and the pan-European Stoxx 600 index has shed 0.4%, according to data source Investing.com.  Seemingly, the appetite for risk has weakened over fears that the current stalemate between the U.S. Republicans and Democrats over additional fiscal stimulus could drag on for weeks.  Bitcoin still remains vulnerable to a pullback in equities, according to Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital.  Daily chart  While the repeated rebound from sub-$11,300 levels is encouraging, the cryptocurrency is still trapped in an ascending triangle.  A breakout would imply a continuation of the rally from lows near $9,000 observed in July.  A move below the lower end would confirm a short-term bearish reversal.  “Bitcoin has to break $12,000 and then $14,000 to get to new highs,"" Alex Mashinsky, CEO and founder of crypto lender Celsius, told CoinDesk.  Upside has recently been capped by short-sellers and hedging by profitable miners, Mashinisky added.  Whale population rises  While bitcoin is consolidating below $12,000, the number of entities (clusters of addresses controlled by the same network entity) holding at least 1,000 BTC continues to grow.  The metric jumped to 1,874 earlier this week, the highest since August 2017, according to data source Glassnode.  The continued rise in the so-called whale entities could be taken as a sign of investor confidence in bitcoin's long-term price prospects.

The partnership, announced Thursday, will see Elliptic's solutions for the screening of transactions and wallets incorporated into the Fidelity-backed Fireblocks platform.  The move means customers of both platforms will be able to check the identity as well as verify potentially risky transactions in order to reduce costs often associated with compliance procedures.  Elliptic's chief scientist and co-founder, Tom Robinson, told CoinDesk the integration would facilitate the ""screening of tens of billions of dollars worth of crypto transactions per month"" by year-end.  With crypto and associated products continuing to draw the interest of large financial institutions, AML, countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) and cybersecurity regulations have become hot topics in 2020.  Elliptic VP of Product Andrea Ramoino said the crypto markets were garnering attention from institutional and retail investors alike as a ""vehicle for value transfer and creation.""  Attaching Fireblocks to Elliptic's partner network means institutional clients would be better protected from financial crime via enhanced crypto risk monitoring, Romoino added.  Fireblocks is looking to position itself at the fore of crypto-asset storage and security solutions having recently integrated blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis to its platform in June.  The tools and services associated with cybersecurity in crypto are going to be key if the market is to gain trust from investors and grow, both companies said in a press statement.

42432507,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNa7zh,1597323318,First Mover: Ethereum Faces Inflation Problem as Gas Fees Soar,"Congestion is building on the Ethereum blockchain, the second-largest blockchain, thanks to the recent popularity of dollar-linked ""stablecoins"" and ""decentralized finance"" applications like Compound.      And now fees to process transactions, which escalate when congestion is high as some users pay up for faster execution speeds, are soaring to levels not seen since the initial coin offering craze of 2017.      Hello readers, you may notice some differences in today's edition of First Mover. We're trying out a few new things with our daily markets newsletter, front-loading the biggest price jumps, refining our big story, and adding two new sections: Token Watch, with the latest developments in altcoins, and Analogs, which highlights how traditional markets are interacting with crypto. We're excited to experiment and iterate on First Mover to make it the best crypto markets newsletter it can be. You can sign up here.      The fees are known as ""gas"" and people are starting to complain about Ethereum gas prices, just like motorists whinge about gasoline costs at the pump. One casualty of the spike could be a slowdown in the pace of development of new projects using the Ethereum blockchain.      ""We've officially priced out experimentation,"" Messari's Ryan Watkins tweeted on Wednesday.      It doesn't help that gas prices are denominated in prices for ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain – ether's price, as denominated in dollars, has tripled this year to about $390. Some options traders are even betting ether could hit $1,000 by December.      So the double-whammy of congestion and speculation has driven median gas prices to about 0.008798 ether, which works out to about $3.30, according to data aggregator Blockchair.      “It’s jamming up a lot of decentralized exchanges,” Peter Chan, lead trader for crypto trading firm OneBit Quant, told CoinDesk. “We and a few other market makers have been forced to stop quoting since gas cost is so high.”    Tweet of the day  Price Point    Bitcoin has erased the dip to $11,300 seen early on Thursday, possibly tracking a continued recovery in gold.  The leading cryptocurrency is trading up slightly on the day near $11,480 at press time. Meanwhile, gold is trading at $1,935 per ounce – up 1.10%. Both assets have recently developed a relatively strong negative correlation.  Bitcoin's drop came after fresh evidence of uptick in inflation in the U.S., even though many investors argue the cryptocurrency should work as a hedge against rising prices.  A U.S. government report released Wednesday showed core consumer prices in the world's largest economy rose last month at their fastest pace in 29 years.    Token Watch    Chainlink (LINK) keeps impressing – The DeFi oracle provider “hasn’t disappointed” when it comes to turning announcements of new partnerships into tangible results, according to Messari, a crypto data provider. “Over 30 projects have fully integrated Chainlink data feeds, most of which went live within the past month,” Messari wrote Wednesday in a daily newsletter. Prices for LINK have jumped eight-fold this year, by far the best performance among digital assets with a market capitalization of at least $1 billion. It's fueled by this year’s rampant speculation over the potential for DeFi (and maybe some marketing help from the so-called LINK Marines),      Yam (YAM) is officially a DeFi meme - In yet another example of just how chaotic the fast-growing (and wildly experimental) realm of DeFi has become, a two-day-old project called Yam quickly built up a market capitalization above $60 million before crashing to $0 early Thursday. Prices for the YAM token had peaked at $167 late Wednesday before spiraling down. The project apparently suffered a bug that led to the loss of $750,000 Curve tokens stored in its treasury. It's not for the faint of heart.    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin's options market is skewed bullish despite bearish developments on the short-term technical charts.      Call options (bullish bets) are drawing higher prices than puts (bearish bets) on the one, three, and six-month time frames, according to data source Skew. Investors may be selling puts and buying calls, causing calls to trade at relatively higher prices.      Put sellers should note that short-term technical studies are now painting a negative picture. The daily chart moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram has crossed below zero, indicating a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change. The indicator is printing deeper bars below the zero line, suggesting potential for a stronger move to the downside.      Further, the five- and 10-day simple moving averages (SMAs) are charting a bearish crossover and the long upper wicks attached to the recent three-day candles are indicating exhaustion of the broader uptrend.      As such, the path of least resistance appears to be on the downside. The immediate support is located at $11,137 (Tuesday's low), which, if breached, would open the doors to $10,659, a low reached on Aug. 2.      On the higher side, an hourly chart descending trendline, currently placed at $11,600, may offer resistance, which, if violated, would shift the focus to $12,000.",NEGATIVE,ETH | LINK,ETH | LINK | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,"Daniel Cawrey, Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/13/first-mover-ethereum-faces-inflation-problem-as-gas-fees-soar,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cd792ef3ec68d195bb8bdec34f8e0903b561699c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432493,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNa7bh,1597322722,What Bitcoin Can Learn From Gold About Staying 'Clean',"J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and is a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.      Bitcoin is often described as digital gold. If bitcoin is to be the next version of the yellow metal, then 2020's gold market may have plenty to teach us about what bitcoin will be like in 2030.      While each molecule of gold is physically the same, not all gold is economically the same. The gold market is effectively a two-tiered system. At the top of the hierarchy is gold housed in a carefully walled garden in London. Everything else that doesn't meet London's strict standards – the second-rate gold – is held outside of the City.      See also: Osho Jha - As This Crisis Worsens, Bitcoin Will Become a Safe Haven Again      Given how regulations are slowly shaping bitcoin, this same degree of standardization may be well on its way to emerging. The upper tier of bitcoins will be made up of all the clean, carefully Know-Your-Customer'ed (KYC) stuff housed at approved exchanges and custodians. The second tier will be everyone else's sub-standard, or “dirty,” bitcoins.      I'm going to provide a rough sketch of the London gold market, then suggest how this applies to bitcoin. The London bullion market is the most energetic gold market in the world. No where else in the world is it possible to sell as much gold, as quickly, at such low fees.      But not just any gold qualifies for entry to the London market. The London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) – an elite group of banks, refiners and transport companies – presides over the London ""good delivery"" rules. This is a set of standards that, if closely followed, grants a gold bar entry into the London system.      To qualify as London good delivery gold, the gold must be in bar form, not coin or dust or jewelry. Not just any bar qualifies. Each bar has to meet the LBMA's specifications for size (250 x 70 x 30 mm), weight (400 ounces), and purity (at least 99.5% pure). The details and placement of the markings stamped on each bar are also prescribed by the LBMA. And only bars produced by refiners from the LBMA's accredited list are allowed into the system.      Good delivery gold can only be held in a handful of vaults located in and around London that are operated by LBMA members. There are currently 8,452 tons of London good delivery gold, worth around $464 billion. So 5% of all gold ever mined conforms to the LBMA's standards.      Movements of gold bars from one LBMA vault to another are recorded and tracked. This preserves the ""chain of custody."" Should a London good delivery bar be withdrawn from an LBMA-approved vault (say someone wants to hold it under a mattress), it immediately falls out of the custody chain and loses its elite good delivery status.    Bitcoin's version of the LBMA would be made up of 10 or so approved exchanges and a few large non-exchange custodians.    Once a bar falls out of the chain of custody, the only way to get it back into the London system is to bring it to an LBMA-approved refiner. It will be re-assayed for a fee before re-approval as good delivery gold. Bars produced by unapproved refiners can only make it into the London system if they are melted down and upgraded into an approved bar.      The net effect is that any bars held outside of London aren't worth as much as the ones inside – they lack the LBMA's imprimatur. If it can't be traded in London, it isn't as liquid. And so it's not as valuable.    Enter bitcoin    So how does this all pertain to bitcoin? Many of the mechanisms for an informal bitcoin version of the LBMA are already present: a core group of regulated exchanges; the emergence of companies that specialize in analyzing bitcoin flows; and an emerging class of speculators who care about getting accredited bitcoins.      There are good reasons for building a carefully sterilized system. In the case of gold, the stuff can be easily faked. Bars with a core of tungsten and a gold shell are common. LBMA standards screen these bars out. Counterfeits, those bars made of genuine gold but falsely marked, are also warded away. So are poorly produced bars, say 98% pure. The combination of the LBMA's rules and the chain of custody guarantees that the world's biggest buyers, institutional investors such hedge funds, central banks, banks and exchange traded funds, are getting only the best gold.      Bitcoin suffers from neither a purity problem nor a counterfeiting problem. The network of independent bitcoin validators ensures that every bitcoin is indeed a 100% real bitcoin.      But it does have its own unique quirk. The entire blockchain is public, so the flow of bitcoins can be tracked. And trackability means some bitcoin addresses may not be as good as others – they may hold funds that were stolen from an exchange, or used to pay ransom, or have been mixed by an anonymizer. These aren't the sorts of bitcoin addresses that a sophisticated investor wants to be associated with.      Gold, like bitcoin, can also be dirty. Drug cartels, for instance, are notorious for buying up gold mines in order to launder money. But the LBMA is working hard to cleanse the supply chain. An accredited refiner will only convert a customer's gold into an approved gold bar if that customer passes a due diligence process set out in the LBMA's Responsible Gold Guidance. So refiners are obligated to have the same KYC procedures as a bank.      The LBMA also requires refiners to screen out gold that has been used in human rights abuses or the financing of conflict. The LBMA market recently suffered through some uncertainty when The Perth Mint, a major refiner, was accused of refining gold sourced from a convicted killer in Papua New Guinea. In theory, this meant that The Perth Mint's gold bars could be kicked out of the London system. Which would mean they'd be worth less. But, after investigating, the LBMA announced that it was compliant. Gold bar owners breathed a sigh of relief.      And so, in theory, not only is a London gold bar 99.5% fine but it hasn't been sourced from drug dealers or crooks. So-called ""blood gold"" is left to trade in informal, less liquid markets, where it is worth less.      Bitcoin's version of the LBMA would be made up of 10 or so approved exchanges and a few large non-exchange custodians. Bitcoins held in this system would easily pass from exchange to exchange, or exchange to custodian, much like how London gold can move from LBMA vault to LBMA vault. But once they were to be withdrawn from the system, say to someone's personal address or to a non-accredited bitcoin exchange, the ""chain of custody"" would be broken.      See also: Olga Feldmeier - Looking for a Safe Haven Digital Asset? Try Gold      To get withdrawn bitcoins back into the walled ""good bitcoin"" garden, approved analyzers like Chainalysis or CipherTrace would have to check the transacional history for anything iffy, much like how today's LBMA-approved refiners carry out due diligence.      Anything that couldn't be verified would be denied access to the system. These non-accredited bitcoins would circulate in a gray economy where they are worth much less. To avoid any risk of losing premium status, it would become increasingly uncommon for bitcoin users to withdraw bitcoins from any of the approved exchanges.      Bitcoin purists would no doubt bristle at the encroachment of this centralized Bitcoin LBMA; not your keys, not your bitcoin. But the Bitcoin LBMA would attract most bitcoin liquidity. Institutional investors, say Grayscale or Paul Tudor Jones, will always prefer to buy bitcoins that are part of an approved chain of custody, just like they’ll always prefer to buy the LBMA’s good delivery gold.      If bitcoin is going to become digital gold, it’s quite possible a bitcoin version of the LBMA will develop. So far a hierarchy hasn't arrived.

42432506,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNa7vh,1597314021,Daily Profitability for Ethereum Miners Hits Over 2-Year High,"With Ethereum transaction fees soaring, the daily profit that can be achieved by miners on the network is now at its highest point in 27 months.    Data from BitInfoCharts shows the daily profitability for Ethereum miner operators is at $5.8 per 100 megahashes second (MH/s) of computing power – a level not seen since early May 2018.  The increasing profitability is a result of the recent price rise of the ether (ETH) cryptocurrency and a surge in transaction fees brought on by increasing levels of decentralized finance (DeFi) activities on Ethereum.  As a result, most of Ethereum mining equipment is now able to operate with a profit margin above 90% even at an electricity cost of $0.05 per kilowatt-hour.  Some more state-of-art equipment can mine with a profit margin of as high as 97%, according to data tracked by mining pool F2Pool.  In July alone, the profitability metric soared by over 60%, as reported by CoinDesk.  At the time, ETH was changing hands at around $320 and daily mining profitability was about $3.27 per 100 MH/s.  In the past two weeks, ETH prices have been closer to $400 per token.  It's worth noting that data from Glassnode shows that the total daily revenue for Ethereum miners in dollar terms have not yet exceeded the level seen in May 2018.  However, the total hash rate securing Ethereum on average is now around 200 petahashes per second (PH/s), while it was over 270 PH/s more than 2 years ago, network data shows.  That means mining is now less competitive and the achievable profitability per 1 megahash power is higher, even though total mining revenue is not.

The price of YAM tokens, which peaked at roughly $167 at 17:30 UTC, had spiraled down to barely $14 at just before 08:00.  Having only launched Tuesday, YAM was a yield farming protocol where tokens were intended to keep parity with the U.S. dollar through loosening or contracting supply.  Its relative newness, though, meant the code hadn't been properly audited; a bug was soon discovered that effectively meant the protocol would keep printing ""dud"" YAM tokens that would prevent token holders from making any governance decisions.  A last-minute attempt to save the protocol ultimately failed and co-founder Brock Elmore pronounced the project dead at 08:01 UTC.  Yam's market cap went to zero moments later.

DeFi meme coin YAM has succumbed to a bug within its rebase function, meaning the coin has lost control of its on-chain governance feature.  All of the roughly $750,000 Curve tokens stored in the project's treasury are lost as well, according to a Medium blog from the team.  Launched Tuesday, YAM had $585 million assets under lock as of 4:30 UTC.  YAM’s code contained a bug that issued “excess” rebase supply to the token’s treasury.  The bug made the project’s on-chain governance feature unusable.  A possible fix slipped through the cracks early Thursday morning. Yam Finance co-founder Brock Elmore voiced his regret in a tweet.  In an ensuing blog post, YAM said it is drawing up plans to launch a new version of the yield farming protocol – presumably without the rebase bug in the codebase.  The team will gauge community interest by setting up a funding goal; if reached the team will develop a migration contract porting the ecosystem onto a new protocol.  A yield farming protocol, the project was supposed to use rebases to adjust supply in order for the token to maintain parity to the U.S. dollar.  The project's rapid surge in user numbers came from the fact it offered features DeFi yield farmers were hunting for, combined with an instantly recognizable symbol in the shape of the yam emoji.  But its relative newness means the code had not yet been audited.  In a post-mortem, the team said even though they thought they had enough votes to save the protocol the bug prevented the proposal from succeeding.

In a Wednesday Fed blog post, economists Rod Garratt and Michael Lee, analyst Brendan Malone and research exec Antoine Martin outlined the characteristics of ""account-based"" and ""token-based"" digital currency systems.  According to the post, an account-based system requires verification of the identity of a payer, while a token-based system needs to verify if the ""object"" (i.e., token) used to pay is valid or not.  The trouble, they write, is that some cryptocurrencies possess characteristics of both.  In fact, the classification method is ""problematic"" because the systems are not mutually exclusive and can't be broken down to provide ""a taxonomic hierarchy of digital payment methods.""  The authors cite bitcoin as a prime example of a payment method possessing characteristics of both systems.  Due to the way cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are constructed, the account-based system for digital currencies can be applied because of the nature of private keys and the alphanumeric string of numbers and letters that make up a bitcoin address.  That is, their identity is verified using the private key and address.  Yet, when a person wants to spend her bitcoin, the protocol verifies the payment's validity by tracking its transaction history, making the crypto a fit for the token-based method.  The authors note the difference among bitcoin, dollar bills and gold coins is whether a recipient of a payment can ascertain the validity of the payment unit with ""reasonably high confidence.""  While dollar bills contain security features making them hard to counterfeit, a crypto user cannot ""independently"" ascertain if their tokens are valid, they write.  It's worth noting that blockchains like Bitcoin's ensure the validity of transactions with multiple confirmations from miners using powerful computing hardware, removing the need for independent verification of each unit.  In conclusion, the authors argue, the distinctions between the two classifications have limited value.  And while such classification systems can be a useful tool in organizing and communicating concepts, in this case they could impede understanding of the growing digital currency technology space.  ""Perhaps these terms should be retired to avoid further confusion,"" they write.

42432503,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNa7th,1597302000,Nigerians Are Using Bitcoin to Bypass Trade Hurdles With China,"Chukwuemeka Ezike sends thousands of dollars' worth of bitcoin a month in order to trade with Chinese exporting companies.      In return, he receives spare auto parts, construction equipment, and juices for a family business his father started more than 30 years ago. Ezike works full-time at Singapore-based crypto exchange Huobi as its community manager but helps with his family's business on the side.      He says bitcoin is faster than exchanging currencies the old-fashioned way. And he can use it to leapfrog bank limits of $10,000 a day, which he often needs to do.      Ezike doesn't pay the manufacturer directly. Over WeChat, he works with a middleman named “Allen” who exchanges Ezike's bitcoin for renminbi, China's national currency, and then passes it on to the manufacturer. Ezike couldn't divulge which companies he deals with, saying, ""The Chinese are sensitive with the data that's shared.""      He's one of several Nigerians using bitcoin for this purpose. Ezike even helps other Nigerian companies make similar cross-border transactions with bitcoin.    Using bitcoin for global trade    In several ways, bitcoin makes sense for global trade. The currency jumps borders with ease, where other currencies encounter friction. If the counterparty is willing to receive bitcoin on the other end, it's often faster and cheaper than legacy payments. But this can be a big ""if"" because bitcoin is a newer way of transferring money and people aren't exactly used to it quite yet.      While bitcoin has these nimble properties, it hasn't disrupted international trade and value transfer just yet, especially given the currency's current limitations. If more people use bitcoin at once, the network becomes congested and payments slow down.      Behind the scenes, developers around the world are working on the Lightning Network to fix these problems so that more people, maybe one day even millions, can all use bitcoin regularly without seeing a spike in fees and sluggish transactions.      Read more: What Is Bitcoin's Lightning Network?      All that said, some Nigerians are becoming reliant on using bitcoin as a way to trade internationally, and are finding bitcoin has significant benefits over legacy financial systems.    Foreign exchange woes    Nigerian bitcoin entrepreneur Chimezie Chuta has another theory for why some are using bitcoin for trade with China and beyond.      Like most other countries in an increasingly globalized world, Nigeria imports a significant percentage of the goods that it uses. As Chimezie Chuta put it: ""Nigeria is a very import-heavy country. Food industry, drugs, you name it, construction equipment, cars."" Much of these goods are bought from Chinese manufacturers. ""Nigeria's economy is heavily import dependent and China is a major import partner to Nigeria,"" Chuta adds.      Nigerians have to struggle with this process, though. ""Access to [foreign exchange (FX)] for importation by Nigerian business owners is highly limited because the [Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)] has limited liquidity to cater for everyone,"" Chuta told CoinDesk.      Read more: Charlie Shrem TLDL: Ray Youssef and Crypto’s Role in Africa      If Nigerians want to reap the benefits of trade, they need to hunt down a way to exchange their naira (Nigeria's national currency) for other currencies. In Nigeria, finding U.S. dollars or Chinese remnibi is not an easy task. ""Importers typically rely on the black market for the additional FX needed and that comes at a very high price,"" Chuta said. This phenomenon has been covered in Bloomberg, for instance.      This is one of the other reasons Ezike has turned to bitcoin as an alternative. ""The hustle for [the] dollar and all that is quite a thing I love to avoid,"" Ezike told CoinDesk.      With bitcoin, he can ""take out all international banking routing processes,"" he said.      Others are reaching the same conclusion.      ""Chinese exporters have expressed willingness to accept bitcoin payments for their goods; hence, many business people in Nigeria find it more convenient to make such payments with bitcoin for obvious reasons,"" Chuta said, adding that bitcoin is speedier, open and trustless.    More naira problems    Entrepreneur Monyei Chinazaekpele was able to buy clothes, COVID-19 masks and tests from House of Trippy in China, to resell to customers in Nigeria.      He decided to use bitcoin after experiencing mounting frustration with current banking limitations, especially their impact on global trade. ""I was enlightened about the monetary policies on the ground. I was shocked to my nerve,"" he told CoinDesk.      Chinazaekpele reiterated Chuta's and Ezike's point that foreign exchange is tough in Nigeria. ""You can't easily switch to other currencies,"" he said, adding that he’s hopeful it's just “a matter of time"" before this situation improves.      ""Basically, bitcoin is stress-free to use and honestly, the naira is not a good store of value,"" Chinazaekpele said, pointing to the naira's 12% inflation rate, which means the value of the currency depreciates by that much value every year.      Bitcoin's price fluctuates, and sometimes the price goes down. But Chinazaekpele argues that bitcoin generally doesn't have this inflation problem because over the long term the price has been going up.      Chinazaekpele's also looking to buy a cashew processor with bitcoin, but he's still working out the details with the factory, which is also located in China.    Keeping it on the down-low    All this trade with bitcoin is happening behind the scenes. Businessmen and women on the ground aren't exactly eager to publicize that they're using bitcoin for international trade. For one, the legality of cryptocurrency is fuzzy in the region.      The CBN has issued several warnings to banks. The latest in 2018 advised banks ""not to use, hold or transact in any way with the technology.""      ""In the bitcoin space we don't know what reaction to expect, so we try to be a little bit discrete,"" Ezike told CoinDesk. That's why he doesn't want to reveal the name of his father's importing business. By only revealing his individual name, he's less fearful that the Nigerian government will ""attack"" the business.      Read more: Where FATF Crypto Compliance Gets Interesting: Africa      ""We have had accounts frozen at some point due to bitcoin transactions,"" Ezike said. ""We had to appeal to re-open them.""      He added that it's the same situation in China, which is why the people he transacts with there “ensure they [keep] a low profile.""      As for the relationship between the government in Nigeria and crypto, Ezike said that ""they are really confused about what to do with it. But hopefully they will embrace it.""",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/08/13/nigerians-are-using-bitcoin-to-bypass-trade-hurdles-with-china,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e19bfcd036e402250fc0e966d3844e34488d073a-2560x1763.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Market capitalization refers to the total number of coins or tokens in circulation multiplied by its spot price and is often used by the community to rank various assets.

LINK has experienced an incredible rise year-to-date having climbed from $1.80 on Jan. 1 to $16.75 as of press time, according to Messari's data.

42432499,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyNa7lh,1597279546,Uniswap's August Volume Topples July $1.76B Record in Less Than Two Weeks,"Uniswap's August trading volume beat July's record high less than halfway into August, surpassing $1.76 billion, leaving more than two weeks to push further into record territory.    Current monthly volume marks the fourth consecutive record high for the leading decentralized trading and automated market-making platform.  In the past 24 hours, Uniswap reported $213 million in volume, accounting for more than 60% of all decentralized exchange volume, according to Dune Analytics.  The record-setting volume comes amid a continued speculative frenzy over new and experimental decentralized financial applications, causing volumes across all decentralized platforms to soar.  The new high also comes less than three months after version 2.0 of the protocol launched with a plethora of new features.  Notably, at the end of July, Coinbase-backed startup Dharma integrated Uniswap to its mobile trading app.  As trading volume grows, Ethereum network fees are skyrocketing. Average transaction fees have spiked 600% to $5.27, according to Blockchair.  Despite the fees, decentralized trading volume ""doesn't look like it will be slowing down anytime soon,"" said Jack Purdy, decentralized finance analyst at Messari, provided the ""money-making opportunities continue to outweigh the cost.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING | UNI,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/13/uniswaps-august-volume-topples-july-176b-record-in-less-than-two-weeks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d0397650e04719e32e49826f1f5177f21c7b43be-929x628.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
