42403228,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfISP,1567117848,Amberdata Discovers 'RPC Call' Bug in Parity Ethereum Client,"A code vulnerability that could have forced computer shutdowns was found on Tuesday in the second most popular ethereum client.  Parity connects over 3,000 computer servers around the globe to the ethereum blockchain network.  On Thursday, Parity Technologies, the startup responsible for building and maintaining the ethereum client, released updated code to fix the bug.  Only a small subset of Parity servers were vulnerable to crashing, according to Scott Bigelow, the VP of engineering at blockchain analytics startup Amberdata. Amberdata first discovered the vulnerability and disclosed it to the Parity Technologies team.  “There was a vulnerability that [if exploited] would cause an immediate crash of the Parity client for all its services,” said Bigelow. “There is no possibility to steal funds or do other malicious things but you could shut down some portion of ethereum nodes.”  In a blog post published Thursday, Parity Technologies wrote:  “Please update your nodes to the newest version ASAP, especially if you’re running a node that has enabled tracing or a node that has enabled publicly-facing RPC.""  What's RPC?  A remote procedure call, or RPC, is a protocol for requesting data and information from a program running on a third-party computer server. It is used on blockchains to request information about on-chain activities such as account balances, block numbers and other data.  It can be used privately by a user or opened for the broader public to access. Infura, one of the most popular applications on ethereum today, leverages public RPC ports to make data about the blockchain network accessible to users who don’t themselves run ethereum clients.  For the vulnerability found by the Amberdata team to be exploited, the ethereum node running Parity software must have enabled a public RPC port and activated a special module to enable the tracing of transaction history, according to Bigelow.  “It’s really this venn diagram,” said Bigelow. “You need to find people who are running Parity nodes, who have a Parity [RPC] port exposed and who also have the tracing module enabled on their system. If you have those three things, you can say that server is gone.”  Parity was susceptible to a similar attack vector back in February. That vulnerability impacted the software's entire user base, not just a specific subset.  Low likelihood of attack  At the same time, this tracing module on Parity is a highly detailed and developer-oriented module that Bigelow suspects only a small fraction of Parity users to have actually enabled.  What’s more, while RPC calls do exist on other ethereum clients, such as Geth, it is highly unlikely for the same kind of vulnerability to exploited on other software – due to how RPC implementations differ across ethereum software clients.  “The RPC interfaces of ethereum clients are not standardized and each client has addition calls for their specific features,” said a Parity Technologies spokesperson. “So it's unlikely they have a similar bug for their analogous call.”  Whatever the probability for attack, Parity Technologies encourages all its users to upgrade immediately, saying in their blog post:  ""By default, Parity Ethereum does not enable tracing or public-facing RPC, so the majority of nodes should be not be affected. Regardless, we recommend everyone running Parity Ethereum nodes to update to this latest version.""

The Chicago-based aircraft and satellite manufacturer became the 10th member of Hedera's governing council Thursday, joining the likes of financial services provider FIS Global, Tata Communications, Nomura Holdings and IBM.  Each member of the council runs its own node operating the hashgraph, and when the network's open access launch takes place next month, these companies will also be able to use the Hedera Consensus Service, allowing members to plug private networks into the public network to take advantage of its transaction ordering system.  Hedera also claims that its distributed ledger technology can facilitate micropayments and distributed file storage and support smart contracts.  Hedera announced earlier on Thursday that it would begin distributing its HBAR tokens, a process that is expected to take 15 years. The company raised $124 million through three rounds of funding using a simple agreement for future tokens (SAFT) framework. Roughly 1,000 participants in the SAFT rounds will receive the first distribution of HBAR tokens.  Boeing, currently the world's largest commercial aircraft manufacturer, as well as a major U.S. and international defense contractor, has made limited moves in the blockchain space to date. The company has previously filed for a patent outlining a blockchain system that could aid in-flight GPS receivers, as well as announced a joint project to improve unmanned aircraft.

Crypto-mining malware campaigns climbed 29 percent from Q4 2018 to Q1 2019 according to the study. McAfee said the campaign was indiscriminate, with both Apple MacOS and Microsoft Windows systems seeing a rise in targeted attacks.  Windows products were typically targeted through PowerShell, and interactive command line and automation engine that delegates administrative tasks to the computer itself. By using PowerShell, vulnerabilities in servers were exploited to mine the privacy coin monero.  McAfee said the attack had worm capabilities, allowing it to jump from server to server.  Malware program CookieMiner was used against MacOS systems to steal private account information stored on users' computers. McAfee said account holders in crypto services Binance, Bitstamp, Bittrex, Coinbase, MyEtherWallet and Poloniex all had personal information stolen.  A report from the BBC earlier this week highlighted a monero crypto-jacking virus which successfully hacked 850,000 servers, mostly in Latin America.

42403231,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfIUN,1567097688,Crypto Lender Dharma Pivots to Stablecoin Savings Accounts,"“Dharma is the easiest place to save your money from anywhere in the world.”  That's the new mission statement for decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Dharma as described by Brendan Forster, co-founder and COO of Dharma Labs, which built the Dharma protocol.  On Thursday, Dharma Labs announced it would be relaunching its services in closed beta beginning with a new savings product.  “We let people save in stablecoins,” Forster told CoinDesk. “What the new product enables is the instant depositing of stablecoins and the instant earning of interest on those stablecoins.”  Having raised $7 million in February 2019, Dharma Labs launched its first product on the ethereum blockchain in April. At the time, Dharma was meant to facilitate peer-to-peer lending and borrowing of cryptocurrencies at fixed interest rates and for fixed durations.  Now, by using existing liquidity pools of crypto on the lending platform Compound, Dharma V2 moves away from fixed interest rates and loan terms to variable ones that dynamically change and don't require users to lock-up their funds. The company's new site advertises interest rates of up to 11.2 percent.  The importance of such a pivot, according to Forster, is all about “ease of use.” In spite of the early success Dharma displayed in its first few weeks, Forster said Dharma users wanted more flexibility – which the original Dharma protocol could not provide.  “[Dharma] was successful but what we heard from our users was that it was too narrow of a use-case. What they wanted was far more tailored around the saving of money, rather than the lending directly of money,” said Forster. “That led to a several-month-long investigation in which we first attempted to build our vision for the savings products on Dharma V1 but ultimately decided ... to build Dharma V2 on the Compound protocol.“  Adding to this, Dharma investor and Autonomous Partners founder Arianna Simpson said:  “Working with Compound allows Dharma to focus on the parts of the business which they do best, which in my view include design, product, and user experience, and instead outsource part of the stack. This is a natural step in the maturation of the industry.”  Building on the strengths of other DeFi platforms and creating synergies within the broader ethereum ecosystem is exactly how Compound founder and CEO Robert Leshner also characterized Dharma's next phase.  ""The Dharma team is building an extremely user-friendly interface that has the chance to onboard to the next 100K users of decentralized finance,"" Leshner told CoinDesk. ""Compound is thrilled for more on-ramps to exist.""  Next steps  Starting today, all existing Dharma users will be grandfathered into the closed beta product. In addition, no new deposits of cryptocurrencies will be allowed on the original Dharma V1 platform. Dharma V1 will only continue to operate until all existing loans have been paid out.  This process of phasing out Dharma V1, according to Forster, actually started in July. With existing Dharma loans in the process of expiring and no new ones being created, the total value of cryptocurrencies locked in Dharma fell from a high of $30 million to now just under $10 millionhttps://www.defipulse.com/dharma.  What may have looked like an unusual drop-off in platform value to any observer in the DeFi space was actually an intentional result of relaunching the Dharma platform as a variable savings product, according to Forster.  In the months to come, Dharma Labs will be expanding Dharma V2 to also include borrowing services, non-custodial smart wallets and fiat on- and off-ramps. Forster's goal is for Dharma to rank as one of the most popular DeFi applications in the ethereum ecosystem.  “It's a matter of months before we reach that peak and, in all honesty, we have our sights set substantially higher than that,” said Forster. “In short, we want to create a borderless bank.”  As such, it’s not just the ethereum ecosystem Dharma could have a major impact on, according to Simpson, but crypto more broadly.  ""Dharma is playing a very important role in making the DeFi ecosystem usable by a class of consumers which is much wider than the early crypto adopters who were previously the only ones who had the technical sophistication to use most of these products and services,"" said Simpson, adding:  ""By making a much better user experience, Dharma is expanding the number and type of people who can interface with decentralized finance, and crypto more generally.""

According to a press release  Thursday, Bitqyck founders Bruce Bise and Sam Mendez raised $13 million by selling Bitqy and BitqyM tokens to more than 13,000 investors in ""unregistered securities offerings."" The SEC alleged that the defendants told investors that Bitqy tokens would provide fractional shares of Bitqyck stock through a smart contract, while BitqyM tokens would provide investors interest in a crypto mining facility.  The SEC also alleged that the defendants ""misrepresented QyckDeals, a daily deals platform using Bitqy, as a global online marketplace,"" and the defendants didn't actually own any mining facilities.  On top of these charges, the SEC also alleged that the defendants operated an unregistered exchange, TradeBQ, to allow investors to trade Bitqy.  ""Investors allegedly received $4.5 million for referring new investors to Bitqyck but collectively lost more than two-thirds of their investment in the Dallas-based company,"" the press release stated.  In a statement, SEC Forth Worth Regional Office Director David Peavler said ""digital investment assets"" can be appealing, particularly to investors who believe they are receiving partial ownership through their tokens. He added:  ""We allege that the defendants took advantage of investors’ appetite for these investments and fraudulently raised millions of dollars by lying about their business.""  The SEC filed for permanent injunctions, civil monetary penalties and the return of all gains with interest, which the defendants agreed to. Bitqyck will pay a civil penalty of $8.5 million on top of disgorgement and prejudgement interest; Bise will pay $890,254; and Mendez will pay $850,022.

42403220,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfIMV,1567092726,Ethereum Client Becomes First Public Blockchain on Hyperledger,"Hyperledger has officially adopted its first public blockchain project in the form of ConsenSys' Pantheon.  The Hyperledger technical steering committee approved Pantheon's addition Thursday morning, renaming the initiative to Hyperledger Besu (a Japanese term for base or foundation). Pantheon was first proposed as a potential new member of the consortium on Aug. 8, joining the likes of Hyperledger Fabric (which IBM has supported) and Hyperledger Sawtooth (backed by Intel).  Pantheon includes a suite of ethereum-based services built by PegaSys, an engineering team at ConsenSys. These services can operate on top of ethereum's public, private and test networks. Grace Hartley, strategy and operations associate at PegaSys, said Pantheon is ConsenSys' only ethereum client in its suite of open-source projects.  ""We've always wanted to be a gateway for enterprises to public chains while also meeting the needs of private and permissioned networks,"" Hartley told CoinDesk. ""I think this is a good step in that process.""  Now the Hyperledger staff will work with ConsenSys to transfer Pantheon's GitHub repository to the consortium and set up email lists and chat channels connected to the project. In recent months, ConsenSys has also donated ConsenSys CAVA to the Apache Software Foundation, which is now being incubated as Apache Tuweni.  ""I expect it to be a pretty easy process,"" said Brian Behlendorf, executive director of Hyperledger. ""It's already a very active open source project. Before it joined Hyperledger, it had its own life with external contributors working on it.""  Pantheon is interested in finding ways to potentially collaborate with Hyperledger Burrow, a modular blockchain client with a permissioned smart contract interpreter partially developed to the specification of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Hartley said.  The Pantheon team is also interested in finding ""cross-chain opportunities"" with Tendermint, Burrow’s consensus algorithm, and in collaborating with Hyperledger Quilt because of its interledger protocol.  Hyperledger's foray into ethereum began with Burrow, and the consortium has partnered with the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance to collaborate on common standards for the blockchain space. Hyperledger has also received a proposal from the Trusted Compute Framework, a project that follows the EEA's standards regarding secure enclaves and other privacy approaches.  ConsenSys has been thinking about adding Pantheon to Hyperledger for the last several months, Hartley said. The company chose Pantheon because of its open-source license and its ability to build enterprise applications on the mainnet. The project's most active users are within the financial services industry and use it especially for settlement and digital asset use cases.  ""We’re eager to include the ethereum community especially when it comes to something like support for private transactions or support for smart contracts that run in a lot of different places,"" Behlendorf said, adding:  ""What's going on in ethereum is something that other public blockchains should be tracking. Maybe solidity or an EVM programming language becomes more of the standard.""  Part of the requirements for projects looking to join Hyperledger is to be open-source under the Apache license or re-licensed as Apache. ConsenSys Open Source Chef Jim Jagielski co-founded the Apache Software Foundation with Behlendorf and others.  ""The PegaSys team has been a quick study,"" Behlendorf said. ""A few folks on their team have been a part of other open-source projects.""

42403240,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfIVM,1567089308,Telegram Will Release Code for Its TON Blockchain on Sept. 1,"Telegram Open Network, or TON, the ambitious blockchain project announced last year by the Telegram messaging app, is expected to release the code needed to run a TON node on Sept. 1, according to two individuals familiar with the project.  One of these individuals is affiliated with TON Labs, a tech startup founded by Telegram's token sale investors. An investor in the token sale also confirmed the date.  Telegram has maintained a high level of secrecy around TON, refusing to speak publicly on the project. TON Labs, which was founded to build developer tools for Telegram, has felt no such inhibition, becoming the only vocal tech company associated with the project. TON Labs has claimed to maintain regular communications with Telegram's own developer team.  To date, there has been only one operational node – run by Telegram itself – on TON’s test network. With the upcoming code release, a broader range of users will be able to run their own nodes. Users can only run nodes on testnet, with a mainnet launch expected for Oct. 31, according to the purchase agreement for Telegram's 2018 token sale.  Russian leaks  Russian publication Vedomosty  reported Wednesday that the release will contain code for the node itself as well as instructions for deploying a node.  Citing unnamed investors in the project, Vedomosty reported that interested developers will be able to use their nodes to test the protocol’s consensus and sharding mechanisms.  According to a leaked white paper, TON will use a Byzantine-fault-tolerant proof-of-stake consensus with “infinite sharding” and the capacity to support a staggering 292 shardchains (49 followed by 26 zeros).  Telegram raised at least $1.7 billion from investors based in Russia, the U.S. and several other nations in a 2018 token sale. If TON doesn't launch by the end of October, Telegram will have to refund its investors, minus any expenses associated with its development.  Investors, Telegram users and the broader crypto community alike have remained interested in Telegram's blockchain project. TON was previously expected to launch last December, before being significantly delayed. Many investors began selling the rights to their future tokens as a result, forming an unofficial secondary market for GRAM, the token associated with the network. However, this is technically a violation of Telegram's investor agreement, which strictly prohibited secondary trades prior to launch.

Under the memorandum of understanding, which was reported by the Korean Economic Daily and later confirmed by Linka, the companies will cooperate so that Wemade Tree's blockchain gaming platform will be able to process wallet payments via Linka's gateway. The goal is to make it easier for users to pay for blockchain-based entertainment.  ""We expect to provide our platform users with a frictionless user experience,” Suk Hwan Kim, CEO of Wemade Tree, said.  Former employees of IBM, VISA, American Express, Samsung Card, and Shinhan Card founded Linka and The company says it was the first to offer a blockchain payment system in Korea. It claims 117 patents.  Linka has two coins: Linka points, which are used for payments; and Linka tokens, which are used to compensate participants and for the payment of commissions.  According to the Korean Economic Daily story, Linka's payments gateway is blockchain-based but will seamlessly accept cash, points and credit cards. The Linka Wallet allows for withdrawals, exchanges, deposits, and email transfers.  Wemade, which was founded in 2000 and trades on the Korea Exchange's Kosdaq secondary board, is a diversified game publisher with a number of massively-multiplayer online role-playing game titles, some of which have achieved cult following. While it has been struggling with intellectual property theft, its fortunes started to turn this year. The company has lodged a number of lawsuits against IP pirates, particularly those in China, and has achieved some important victories.

Hedera announced Thursday that FIS Global will become the ninth addition to its 39-member council. Hedera also announced that it intends to launch its mainnet in beta on Sept. 16.  The company claims its distributed ledger technology can facilitate micropayments and distributed file storage; support smart contracts; and will allow private networks to plug into the public one to take advantage of its transaction ordering mechanism. At launch, Hedera claims it can support up to 10,000 transactions per second and file services at 10 transactions per second.  FIS joins council members from multiple industries and four continents, including Japan-based Nomura Holdings, India's Tata Communications and American tech giant IBM. It is the first U.S.-based financial services provider to join the group.  FIS declined to comment.  ""We wanted to make sure that those initial members were diverse enough,"" Leemon Baird, co-founder, chief scientist and inventor of the hashgraph consensus algorithm, told CoinDesk. ""They’re on different continents, under different governments and in different industries.""  Greater reach  While the addition of FIS will further decentralize Hedera’s governance, the network is still looking to diversify its governing council – both by geography and by industry.  ""We started with what we think are the low-hanging fruit, but there’s a large swath of the market we have not begun to touch,"" said Mance Harmon, CEO of Hedera. ""For instance, we don’t have anyone in the energy sector or the automobile industry.""  When the mainnet is launched, the distribution of Hedera’s HBAR tokens will begin and continue over the course of 15 years. So far, the company has raised $124 million after three rounds of funding through simple agreements for future tokens (SAFTs). The first distribution of HBAR tokens will be to the approximately 1,000 participants in the SAFT rounds.  Hedera is releasing HBAR in tranches over time to avoid anyone cornering the HBAR market, which would allow them to monopolize the nodes as well.  Before the mainnet launch, Hedera will announce a 10th governing member, and 13 nodes will run the open system with three of the 10 governing members running two nodes. (Hedera says that 13 nodes are more secure than 10 nodes. In the future all members will run one node.)

42403239,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfIbG,1567070134,Bitcoin Eyes $9K Price Support After Drop to One-Month Lows,"View  Bitcoin risks falling to $9,000 in the next 24 hours, having dived out of a narrowing price range on Wednesday. A violation there would expose the next support lined up at $8,500.  The breakdown looks legitimate as it is backed by a surge in selling volumes. The daily chart indicators are also reporting bearish conditions.  A weekly close (Sunday, UTC) below $9,533 would confirm a double top breakdown on the weekly chart.  The bearish case would be invalidated above Wednesday's high of $10,280, although that looks unlikely.      Bitcoin (BTC) could drop to $9,000 in the next 24 hours, having strengthened the short-term bearish case with a drop to one-month lows earlier today.  The top cryptocurrency by market value fell to $9,320 at 07:36 UTC today, the lowest level since July 28, according to Bitstamp data.  Prices fell 4.48% on Wednesday, confirming a downside break of a recent narrowing price range represented by trendlines connecting Aug. 20 and Aug. 26 highs and Aug. 15 and Aug. 22 lows.  Essentially, sellers came out victorious in a tug of war with the bulls, signaling a resumption of the sell-off from the Aug. 6 high of $12,325.  That bearish view has been bolstered by BTC's drop to four-week lows below the July 15 low of $9,467. As a result, a deeper slide to levels below $9,000 could be in the offing.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $9,415 on Bitstamp, representing a 7 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  Daily chart  The range breakdown and the drop to one-month lows have exposed July's low of $9,049.  Supporting the bearish case are the downward sloping 5- and 10-day moving averages. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has also breached key support (horizontal line) and is reporting bearish conditions with a below-50 print.  What's more, the cryptocurrency has also found acceptance below the 100-day moving average (MA) – a level which acted as strong support in the seven days to Aug. 27.  Further, the 50-day moving average is beginning to trend south in favor of the bears.  4-hour chart  Trading volumes picked up as BTC dived out of the narrowing price in the U.S. trading hours yesterday. In fact, the selling volume witnessed in the four hours to 20:00 UTC on Wednesday was the highest since Aug. 7.  All-in-all, the stage looks set for a deeper drop in BTC. Acceptance below the July low of $9,049 would open the doors to $8,500.  The bearish case would be invalidated if the cryptocurrency finds acceptance above Wednesday's high of $10,280, although, as of writing, that looks unlikely.  Weekly close is pivotal  Bitcoin's weekly line chart shows the cryptocurrency has charted a double top bearish reversal pattern with neckline support at $9,533. As of writing, prices are trading below the neckline support.  The breakdown, however, would be confirmed, only if prices print a UTC close below $9,533 on Sunday. That would create room for a sell-off to lows below $7,550 (target as per the measured move method).  The double top breakdown, if confirmed, would imply an end of the rally from lows near $4,050 seen on April 1.  It is worth noting that that the moving average convergence divergence histogram has already confirmed a bearish reversal with a drop below zero – the first since February.
