On June 15, Compound users began earning the application's new governance token, COMP, for all cryptocurrency lent to others on the app and also for all borrowed. Users rushed to get the first disbursements of COMP because the liquid supply on the market is so limited.

The bank said the digital currency prototype is being developed by Digital Ventures, a fintech-facing venture capital wing of the Siam Commercial Bank that invested in Ripple in 2016.      According to the statement, the project will also include a feasibility study on the payments system. The CBDC project will begin next month and is expected to conclude by the end of the year.      “The project marks an important step in broadening CBDC’s scope and adoption to wider audiences, starting with large corporates,” said the press release published on the Bank of Thailand’s website.      The Bank of Thailand said it expects the CBDC prototype to build on the knowledge put together under Project Inthanon.

42404741,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkTkq,1592655767,How Public Key Infrastructure Will Revolutionize Custody and Fund Management,"Stefan Loesch is a director and board member of a tokenization firm. He used to serve as a consultant at McKinsey, and as a banker at JPMorgan. He is the author of a book on financial services regulation and a lecturer at the University of Nicosia. The views expressed here are his.      The widespread use of public/private key pairs will greatly change the world of custody and, I will argue here, those changes will be passed through to the world of fund management.      On the custody side, I have summarized the argument here.      The essence is simple. In the traditional world, firms identify their customers with a shared secret, typically a username/password combination. As the word “secret” implies, third parties need to take a firm’s word on trust as to whether it acts on behalf of the customer. There is no means for anyone to independently verify whether any given instruction has been given by the customer, or whether the firm or one of its employees went rogue.      In the world of securities custody, there are typically at least two firms involved. This mirrors that financial services has two sets of customers, the issuers and the investors. So in custody there is the investor’s custodian, and the issuer’s depositary. For investors to put funds into an issuer’s asset, there must be a link of trust between their custodian and the issuer’s depositary.      See also: Custody Battle Pits Institutional Boomers Against Crypto Upstarts      To see how this creates significant economies of scale, let’s consider that there are 150+ countries in the world. If we only have one custodian and one depositary per country, we need more than 10,000 bilateral links to be established. Every time two entities merge they can cut the number of external links in half, hence the strong push for large global depositories and custodians who can internalize many of their links.      A system built on public key cryptography is fundamentally different. Every customer is associated with a public/private key pair. The identity of that customer and their linkage to the public key is appropriately attested, for example through the European Union’s eIDAS system or some privately run attestation scheme. In this system, every participant can independently verify whether or not instructions are genuine, simply by verifying whether instructions have been signed by the correct key.      There is no need for trust forwarding between different parts of the custody chain. Instead, the depositary deals with all administrative issues, and the custodians’ only role is to keep their customers’ keys secure, and to provide a pleasant user experience. This, in turn, allows custodians of all shapes and sizes to appear, including self-custody and custody for friends and family.    How this will impact fund management    Once we have a world with such a diverse range of custody options, the world of fund management will shift as well. Today, every fund retains its own custodian, and this custodian holds the entirety of the fund’s assets. The fund’s investors simply have a pro rata claim on the fund assets in custody. Because of this single-portfolio custody arrangement, every investor’s portfolio composition has to be exactly the same. In the brave new world of “artisanal” custody with a lot of small custodians with a differentiated offering, fund managers will become more like today’s CTAs. This means they will either advise their clients of what to buy and what to sell, or they will have discretion to transact on behalf of their clients within an agreed set of boundaries.      Smart contracts assure that transactions they enter into are fair. Those contracts ensure the exchange of currency tokens (e.g. stablecoins for security tokens) happens atomically, meaning that either all legs of a transaction are settled or none are. They can also ensure that prices are reasonable, perhaps automatically blocking transactions that fall outside of market norms.    Fund managers will be more like commodity trading advisors who tell clients what to do, but don’t custody the portfolios    In this world, an investor’s portfolio composition is no longer constrained by the shackles of common custody. Fund managers can tailor their investment strategy to their customers. For example, some customers might not want tobacco stocks or weapons producers or CO2 polluters. Others might have a specific blacklist of companies in which they do not want to invest. Fund managers can take those wishes into account. The simplest way to do this is to simply not enter into the offending investments. More sophisticated managers might run a more complex algorithm that rebalances the remainder of the portfolio as well to maintain the overall risk and reward characteristics for example by adding some other stocks instead.      In this world, investors will also be able to interact with more managers than before. For example, they can allocate some funds to niche investment managers. They can even allocate investments to a friend, safe in the knowledge that whatever investment boundaries have been agreed they will not be breached. Also, investing can become more fun. It can be gamified, or retail investors might earn more tangible benefits. For example, a football club could raise funds for a new stadium and provide token holders access to investor lounges, tiered by the investment amount.    The real meaning of 'fractionalization'    Also in this public/private key driven world, a lot of the distinct roles in today’s custody world will collapse into one, or can be replaced by smart contracts. Payment and settlement, communications and voting can all be executed on-chain or near-chain. Data is by and large automatically consistent, and there is no need for bank account details and postal or email addresses. This dramatically reduces the cost of servicing investments, which in turn reduces the minimum viable investment size.      This is the meaning of fractionalization: you can put a single asset onto the market, sell it to thousands of investors, and the administrative burden is still manageable. This allows investments into SMEs, or asset finance projects like for example single-object real estate or solar farms. Minimum viable sizes are small and it might even be possible to finance things like single-household solar installations individually, with payments automatically processed via the associated electricity company and production data being immutably recorded on-chain.      See also: Beyond Storage: How Custody Is Evolving to Meet Institutional Needs      Two great forces are set to re-shape the fund manager industry.      On the one hand, we have the change in the custody model, which means single-investor custody and individual portfolio composition. Investors can bypass fund managers and directly invest into all kinds of investments that thus far have only been available to them via a fund investment.      On the other hand, we have a multiplication of investment opportunities and choices. Retail investors have a heavy cognitive load to make sense of their options. Even for professional investors spending their working days on this task, it is hard to closely follow all stocks of the S&P 500. For retail investors, it is already impossible. If we multiply the number of possible investments by 1,000x – and fractionalization easily does this – we see that retail investors will still need professional help on the large majority of their portfolio, so the fund managers’ role will not disappear but it will change to account for the shifting realities.      The exact changes remain to be seen, but it seems that robo advice – or more generally AI assisted advice – will be an important part of the picture. Sequoia’s recent investment into Vise is a testament to this trend. People will want to be more empowered to make their own individual investment decisions, in ticket sizes that suit them rather than being driven by the denominations of shares traded in the market. So we have seen Charles Schwab following Robinhood’s lead on fractionalization of shares.    Conclusion    I expect three things to happen as a result of these trends. First, fund managers will be more like commodity trading advisors who tell clients what to do, but don’t custody the portfolios. Two, they will take very specific client preferences into account, and will use AI or other automation tools to do that. And three, they will only manage a part of their customers’ investments, with another part being allocated to investments that bring additional benefits, for example being able to have a beer in the investors’ lounge of your favorite football club.      This, however, is a long-term vision, and it will take some time to get there.

42404733,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkTdx,1592619429,"New York US Attorney Geoffrey Berman Steps Down, President Trump Nominates SEC Chair Jay Clayton to Post [Updated]","U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton may be the next U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.      According to a Department of Justice press release published late Friday, Clayton was nominated by U.S. President Donald Trump to helm the prosecutor's office, three years after he first took on the role as chairman of the nation's top securities regulator. Clayton's term as chairman was slated to expire in 2021.      While initially the press release said current SDNY U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman would be stepping down, he denied plans to resign in a statement late Friday. Trump fired him Saturday, according to a separate statement from U.S. Attorney General William Barr, although Trump himself apparently told reporters he was ""not involved."" Ultimately, Berman said late Saturday he would be stepping down ""effective immediately.""      ""It has been the honor of a lifetime to serve as this District’s U.S. Attorney and a custodian of its proud legacy,"" Berman said in his second statement.      In Friday's DOJ statement, attributed to Barr, the department announced U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Craig Carpenito would also serve in the Southern District role on an interim basis starting July 3, until Clayton is confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Barr's statement on Saturday changed this as well, announcing that Deputy U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss would instead be filling in on the interim basis.      ""I know that under her leadership this Office’s unparalleled [assistant U.S. attorneys], investigators, paralegals and staff will continue to safeguard the Southern District’s enduring tradition of integrity and independence,"" Berman said in his statement Saturday.      According to Stephen Vladeck, law professor at the University of Texas School of Law, it was possible Berman could continue serving until Clayton is confirmed. Martin Lederman, a former Deputy Assistant Attorney General and current law professor at the Georgetown University Law Center, said on Twitter Trump can remove Berman but Barr cannot.      Preston Byrne, a partner and attorney with Anderson Kill, told CoinDesk the issue surrounding this question is whether the provisions addressing appointments and firings conflict. In his view, ""they only conflict if appointees can't be fired.""      Marc Goldich, co-managing partner of Axler Goldich LLC, told CoinDesk that ""there's a decent argument"" Berman could have continued serving until Clayton is confirmed.      ""Notwithstanding that (and notwithstanding arguments for prosecutorial independence), the President is of course granted executive authority which – at least customarily – includes the authority to fire U.S. Attorneys under Article II of the Constitution,"" he said.    Line of succession    Barr's statement did not indicate who might replace Clayton at the SEC's helm. On Saturday, Clayton sent an email to staff saying he would continue working at the SEC until he is confirmed, according to Bloomberg. The confirmation process will give New York's two senators, Democrats Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, a chance to weigh in on Clayton, according to NPR reporter Carrie Johnson.      ""For the past three years, Jay has been an extraordinarily successful SEC Chairman, overseeing efforts to modernize regulation of the capital markets, protect Main Street investors, enhance American competitiveness, and address challenges ranging from cybersecurity issues to the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Barr said in his statement.      As SEC chair, Clayton oversaw the regulator during the peak of the 2017 initial coin offering bubble and much of the aftermath. At various events, he has discussed the agency's approach to the crypto space, including raising questions about the bitcoin market's ability to be manipulated, size and custody solutions.      “Just speaking for myself, we have to get to a place that we can be confident that trading is better regulated,"" he said last September about the crypto space.      SDNY has also been active in crypto regulation, bringing a number of cases against allegedly fraudulent crypto projects. Unlike his predecessors at SDNY, Clayton is not a prosecutor, said Politico reporter Zachary Warmbrodt.    Friday's announcement comes on the heels of Trump announcing he would be renominating Commissioner Hester Peirce for another five-year term. The move leaves two seats vacant on the SEC, after Democrat Commissioner Robert Jackson Jr. resigned earlier this year. Trump has nominatedhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/president-donald-j-trump-announces-intent-nominate-individual-key-administration-post-23/ SEC senior counsel Caroline Crenshaw to the post.
