42427957,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4vph,1508586051,"Macroeconomics, Gambling and Crypto: A Perfect Storm?","Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.      The gambling world is no stranger to disruption. Just as online platforms are pushing aside evocative, casino-based settings, they themselves are starting to face big change.  The threat – or the opportunity – comes from two trends, one cultural and one technological.  On the cultural side, we have the explosive growth of eSports, which now spans a range of online venues, genres and demographics. Analysts insist that the recent surge is a small foretaste of what is to come. There is even talk of them becoming a medal event at the Olympic Games.  From technology, we have blockchain. While gambling with cryptocurrencies has been around since the early days of bitcoin (and is expected to grow strongly as customers get more comfortable with the concept), an interesting twist appears to be emerging from platform tokens.  Combine these trends with national legislation and economic strategy, and you begin to see a fundamental shift that has the potential to transform a massive segment of the leisure economy.  And in the process, it could also give a big boost to the development of distributed ledgers and digital tokens.  Rolling the dice  As an example, this past week U.S.-based eSports betting platform Unikrn got an online gambling license from Malta. This enables it to offer real-money betting to most of Europe, and token-based betting to the rest.  What makes this noteworthy is the platform’s new crypto token. A couple of years ago, the company created a platform-only digital token to enable users to place bets on the outcomes of games such as League of Legends. The new version, however, will run on the ethereum blockchain.  This means that it can be traded between players, sold on an exchange and converted to fiat money in many jurisdictions. It also points to the emergence of a community of developers that in theory could extend its utility by creating additional apps and add-ons.  A more intriguing aspect, though, is the strategy of the Maltese government, and where this could lead.  To help offset the decline in manufacturing, the Maltese government over the past few years has focused on attracting technology businesses to the island, offering relatively lenient legislation, low tax rates and lots of sunshine. The efforts have largely centered on the gaming industry, given its potential to foster related sectors such as finance and film.  Malta was the first state in the EU to regulate online gaming platforms, back in 2001. Since then, the industry has grown to be one of the world's largest, accounting for over 10 percent of its domestic GDP.  By incorporating the potential for eSports gambling and cryptocurrency tokens into the mix, the island is not only signaling a future-first approach to gaming legislation. It also appears to be setting the stage for a broader development of blockchain technology.  All in?  To see an example of this strategy in practice, we only need to hop over to the Isle of Man.  Like Malta, it was an early legislator of online betting (which grew to account for almost 20 percent of GDP). This, combined with fast internet and a zero percent corporate tax rate, encouraged an influx of technology businesses, which in turn helped to foster a strong cryptocurrency ecosystem. Official support for blockchain technology was not far behind.  In 2015, the Isle of Man was the first government in the world to trial a blockchain platform – fittingly, for registering digital currency companies. It was also one of the first to regulate bitcoin businesses. Last year, it became the first jurisdiction to officially recognize bitcoin gambling, and just last month it announced its intention to foster a friendly framework for token sales.  Malta appears to be following in the Isle of Man's footsteps.  It recently announced its intention to legalize bitcoin gambling, and last month unveiled a blockchain advisory board to steward its national strategy around the adoption of the technology. It also is contemplating testing the impact of cryptocurrencies on the national economy, and last week revealed a trial for putting academic credentials on the blockchain.  However, the potential impact of Malta’s moves is much greater than that of its larger counterpart.  Malta is part of the EU, while the Isle of Man (a self-governing dependency under the British crown) is not. Any licensed business domiciled in Malta can offer its services in other EU countries, without needing a domicile in each one.  While this is interesting for eSports betting sites such as Unikrn, it could be especially compelling for other cryptocurrency startups. Malta has not yet made an official announcement on digital token sales, but it is likely to be only a matter of time.  And its support for blockchain experimentation – both in the private and public sector – points to the development of a forward-thinking ecosystem that in turn will breed further innovation and growth.

42427962,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4vxh,1508573713,Money at Risk? Mobile Wallets Become Battleground in Bitcoin Fork Debate,"Mobile bitcoin wallets users might not realize it, but their money might be at a heightened risk this November.  While advertised as a tool bitcoin users can tap to achieve an experience more akin to a conventional financial product, mobile bitcoin wallets today send transactions to the bitcoin blockchain, though in a way that differs from the default wallet options. But come November this construction could cause turbulence, because that's when the bitcoin protocol is aiming to undergo yet another major change to its software.  Following this summer's activation of the code upgrade SegWit, a group of businesses are now seeking to trigger a hard fork to increase bitcoin's block size and further expand its transaction capacity. The code, part of a larger upgrade called Segwit2x, could lead bitcoin to split into two (again), that is, if not everyone decides to support the upgrade.  Still, the difference is that, unlike bitcoin cash, Segwit2x's developers are doing everything they can to keep all bitcoin users on the same blockchain.  Segwit2x lead developer Jeff Garzik told CoinDesk:  ""The design goal of Segwit2x – just like [the latest] ethereum fork – is to upgrade bitcoin, not create a new currency.""  To do so, developers backing the project also have made a couple of key (if controversial) design decisions that have to do with maintaining compatibility with ""simplified payment verification"" wallets, the technical term for smartphone-based bitcoin wallet applications.  But developers argue that there are pros and cons of how they are trying to accomplish this.  For one, it might not exactly be safe for mobile wallet users to make transactions immediately after the hard fork is enacted.  Attack resistance or convenience?  The first design decision is omitting so-called ""replay protection.""  A bit of a political term, it's meant to describe what happens when a blockchain splits in two, as users suddenly have equal value on both blockchains. This means that when users move tokens on one blockchain, the tokens also move (or ""replay"") on the other.  But this isn't visible to people who might not know that they have money on two networks during a network split. Worse case: users might lose some of their money and not even notice.  ""It becomes unpredictable what money you're moving and when,"" Bread Wallet CMO Aaron Lasher explained in conversation with CoinDesk.  Since not everyone agrees with the Segwit2x hard fork – some are even going as far as to write up manifestos in opposition – it's likely to split into two competing networks, and this could be confusing for general users.  However, Segwit2x developers have a reason for leaving replay protection out: to keep Segwit2x compatible with SPV mobile wallets.  ""'Replay protection', as you call it, splits the chain. It simply doesn't make sense. You'd suddenly be breaking [more than 10 million] SPV clients that otherwise work just fine. It is a goal of Segwit2x to help avoid this,"" BitGo CEO Mike Belshe wrote in an email debate between developers of the project.  In other words, replay protection would cause inconvenience for mobile wallet users who want to shift over to the Segwit2x blockchain, so Segwit2x developers don't plan on adding it.  Hard fork decisions  Mobile wallets are the subject of debate in another area as well.  Many providers of this wallet option, such as Electrum and Bread Wallet, rely on SPV. This does away with need to hold a full copy of the blockchain, making the data far easier to store on storage-strapped cellphones.  But, they have some drawbacks. (Coinkite co-founder CEO Rodolfo Novak went as far as to quip that ""the 'V' in SPV stands for Victim."")  As implemented today, SPV wallets will automatically follow whatever version of bitcoin has the most miners backing it. So, if bitcoin splits into two, and Segwit2x attracts more computing power than the legacy bitcoin chain, then all of the SPV wallets will follow along. That's by design.  But some mobile wallet providers aren't so happy about this, as it's hard to explain to users what's happening.  ""It's really tough for us because we are so direly affected,"" said Lasher.  This also has the potential to lead to some technical problems. If there are two bitcoins, mobile wallet software might get confused about which chain to follow, especially if miners switch between blockchains over time (as happened in the aftermath of the bitcoin cash fork).  ""It could confuse SPV clients and result in clients switching back and forth between chains, making them lose money depending on which chain has more work at what point,"" Chaincode engineer Matt Corallo said.  Novak painted another scenario.  ""With SVP you don't know if the node you are connected to is lying to you. For example, a Segwit2x node can spoof as a [bitcoin] node [on the other chain], this means that without replay protection your wallet may spend the funds in the wrong chain and lose them on the correct chain,"" Novak told CoinDesk.  Overall, developers paint an assortment of ""if-then"" scenarios. Lasher admitted as much, noting that it's unclear which ones will actually play out.  ""It's really this decision tree of many, many things that can happen. And all of them are on the scale of somewhat annoying to downright dangerous,"" he said, adding that Bread Wallet plans to encourage users to stop making transactions during the hard fork, ""if they can manage.""  A solution?  But with disarray at the application layer, protocol developers have been arguing about how best to handle what might come.  Bitcoin contributor James Hilliard, well-known for helping to prevent a bitcoin split earlier this year, suggested a change to the Segwit2x codebase that he argues would give mobile wallets more control over the which bitcoin they ultimately land on.  Again, though, Segwit2x developers argue that this change would make it more difficult for users to transition to a blockchain with a block size increase – something they believe many users want to do, so that they can make cheaper transactions. (Garzik argued that is the most ""neutral"" metric for determining which chain SPV wallets should follow.)  But, again, others believe that this will confuse users and perhaps even lead those that are unaware of the situation to lose money.  Some developers even agree that there needs to be a block-size parameter increase, but simply disagree with some of Segwit2x's design decisions.  As such, the statements highlight that, while often portrayed as black and white, the scaling argument still has its shades of gray.  Lasher concluded:  ""There might be some merits to a block-size increase. But we don't agree with the current way it's being pushed through.""
