19427218,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557711,1698361253,Crypto Analyst Who Called Bitcoin’s Parabolic Rally Picks Altcoin Set To Pop,"Predicting the Bitcoin price movements and when altcoin prices will rally again is not a small feat but one analyst has managed to do so. Crypto analyst TonyTheBull has been calling for a bull market, saying that this cycle differs from previous ones in the fact that there will be a rally this year. This proved to be true last week when the price of Bitcoin started surging and hit as high as $35,100. Now the analyst has called the next altcoin to outperform, and it already is. Fetch (FET) Is Next Altcoin In Line In the latest iteration of the CoinChartist (VIP) newsletter, crypto analyst TonyTheBull revealed that Fetch (FET) was his next pick after the Bitcoin breakout. He revealed that he had previously bought FET which ended up outperforming in January, and believes the same will be the case here as well. Related Reading: Bitcoin Resumes Rally After Brief Hiatus, Here’s What Happened FET which is one of the top AI-powered crypto tokens is already on the rise after the analyst called it at the $0.24 level. TonyTheBull also posits that a Raging Bull indicator flipping on would be able to confirm further upside. “Waiting for the Raging Bull to turn on would help confirm increased bullishness in the altcoin,” the newsletter read. Source: CoinChartist The Raging Bull Indicator, explained the analyst, “was designed using the Relative Strength Index to help indicate when Bitcoin or other assets are in a bull market, and more importantly, and impulsive like trend.” Basically, this indicator helps to show the strength of a cryptocurrency. Looking at FET’s performance since the call, it has already climbed over 30% and is now trading above $0.3, hitting a local peak of $0.32 on Wednesday. FET price sitting above $0.29 | Source: FETUSD on Tradingview.com Bitcoin Not The Only One Looking Good Despite Bitcoin still looking incredibly bullish on the charts, the analyst points out some altcoins that have had their Raging Bull Indicators turned on this year as well. The first on the list is Solana whose indicator turned on for the first time since 2022. Following this, the digital asset went on a massive run but it might not be done. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crosses $35,000, Here’s Why TonyTheBull revealed that the last time this indicator was turned on, Solana blew up by 500%, and then continued on to do a 17,000% rally. So if it sticks to historical performance, the Solana rally might only be in its early stages. Source: CoinChartist The next altcoin to appear on the list is Chainlink’s LINK. LINK moved from around $7 to over $11 in a matter of days. But just like Solana, this coin may only be in its early stages. LINK’s Raging Bull Indicator last turned on in 2019 and the coin saw a “700% in the near term, and more than 9,000% in total.” The analyst further added, “This might not be a setup to sleep on.” Follow Best Owie on X (formerly Twitter) for market insights, updates, and the occasional funny tweet… Featured image from Binance, chart from TradingView.com",POSITIVE,FET,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | FET,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/crypto-analyst-bitcoin-altcoin/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

The lawmakers, led by Senator Cynthia Lummis, reference a controversial Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report that alleges Hamas and its affiliate raised significant funds through cryptocurrencies. Binance And Tether Face Calls For Criminal Charges In a joint letter signed by Senator Lummis and Representative French Hill, the lawmakers express deep concern over reports indicating that “unregulated crypto intermediaries” outside the United States have allegedly facilitated illicit financial activities, including financing terrorism, such as Hamas’s attacks on Israel. Lummis and Hill urged the DOJ to promptly reach a charging decision regarding Binance, considering the extent of its involvement, and to conclude the ongoing investigation into Tether’s alleged illicit activities. Related Reading: FTX Ramps Up Restitution Efforts, Subpoenas AI Firm CAIS Over $6.5M Investment The lawmakers refer to the WSJ report of October 10, 2023, which disclosed that Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Hezbollah had received cryptocurrency funding since August 2021. They stress the DOJ’s need to hold any entities facilitating illicit activities accountable. The letter further reads: We believe that it’s imperative that the Department of Justice hold bad actors accountable if they are shown to facilitate illicit activity. Binance, notably, is an unregulated crypto asset exchange based in the Seychelles and Cayman Islands. Binance has historically been linked to illicit activity and is purportedly the subject of a current Department of Justice investigation. On the other hand, Tether faced a fine by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in 2021 for issues related to backing its stablecoin USDT. The lawmakers urged the DOJ to thoroughly assess whether Binance and Tether have provided material support and resources for terrorism by violating applicable sanctions laws and the Bank Secrecy Act. Lummis and Hill emphasize the importance of swift action to cut off funding sources for terrorists targeting Israel. Tether Counters Allegations In response to Senator Lummis and Rep. Hill’s claims, Tether issued a statement addressing the “misinformation” surrounding the potential misuse of cryptocurrencies. Tether references independent investigations by Chainalysis and Elliptic, which found significant errors and faulty attribution techniques in reports, including the WSJ’s article. Tether emphasizes its commitment to regulatory compliance, due diligence, and global collaboration with law enforcement agencies. They highlight their track record of freezing assets tied to illicit activities and assert no evidence of sanctions law or Bank Secrecy Act violations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Surge: Matrixport Forecasts $125,000 Price Target By December 2024 Tether further notes the inherent transparency of blockchain technology and the proactive measures taken by virtual asset service providers to monitor and report potentially illicit activities. They reaffirm their dedication to transparency, compliance, and collaboration with authorities, inviting constructive dialogue and cooperation. As the call for a DOJ investigation unfolds, the cryptocurrency community awaits further developments and the potential impact on Binance and Tether’s operations. As of this writing, BNB is trading at $221, representing a decrease of 0.9% within the last 24 hours. However, it is worth noting that the token has experienced significant gains over the past seven and thirty days, amounting to 5.3% and 4.9%, respectively.

19423027,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557749,1698354023,LooksRare Monthly NFT Trading Volume Flash Crashes 97% In October: What’s Next?,"The monthly trading volume of LooksRare, a decentralized non-fungible token (NFT) and digital collectible marketplace, is down 97%, crashing from $71.9 million registered in September 2023 to just $2.1 million in October, Token Terminal data shared by Web3 Academy on October 26, via X shows. LooksRare’s Monthly Volume Tanking, Falls To $2.1 Million In October The unprecedented drop in activity couldn’t be pinned on any particular LooksRare-related event when writing on October 26. This contraction is despite the broader cryptocurrency market recovering, rising as seen by the welcomed expansion of leading assets, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Surge: Matrixport Forecasts $125,000 Price Target By December 2024 According to trackers, monthly volume has been falling steadily since April 2023. Then, the average volume exceeded $150 million, pointing to rising interest, especially from traders. At that time, it should be noted that most crypto assets were also growing. Specifically, Bitcoin broke higher, touching $30,000, triggering demand and reviving hopes that the market was looking up again following the collapse in 2022. By June through September, the average monthly volume in LooksRare had more than halved before plunging to less than $3 million in October 2023. The spike in monthly trading activity in April coincided with the release of LooksRare v2, which saw the platform’s developers reduce trading fees by 75% from 2% to 0.5%. The updated version is also more gas efficient, allowing traders to save up to 30% on gas compared to the previous edition. Moreover, with LooksRare allowing traders to place bulk orders when buying or selling, monthly volume rapidly rose in April. NFT Bull Run Postponed, Will LOOKS Break Resistance Line? With activity rapidly contracting, LOOKS, the native token of LooksRare, has also been flat-lining, looking at price action. The token trades around the $0.070 level at spot rates, retesting August highs. However, an inverted hammer suggests that the uptrend momentum could wane, and bears might reverse gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Upcoming Leap? Analyst Predicts A Potential $45,500 Rise By November Despite concerns, LOOKS is up 60% from H2 2023 lows and may still rally in the months ahead. Looking at the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, a close above $0.070 with expanding volumes could set the ball rolling for buyers who expect the token to retest 2022 lows at around $0.12. Overall, NFT and digital collectible trading activity remains relatively lower, even with bullish traders expecting prices to turn around and rally in 2024. Recently, there was a brief increase in the floor prices of leading NFT collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Azuki, and CryptoPunk. However, with trading volume and the number of new owners still at record lows, researchers put off the chance of an NFT bull run starting in Q4 2023.

42392193,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2Srt,1698352946,"Bitcoin Cools Off at $34K, But '5th Bull Market' Has Further to Run, Says Analyst","BTC slipped 2% to $34,000 as crypto markets cooled off after rally, with the CMI down 1.3%.  Meme coins DOGE and PEPE outperformed, while LINK and AGLD dropped on FTX movements.  Bitcoin is in its fifth bull market driven by institutional adoption as a safe haven asset, and could reach $125,000 by 2024 year-end, Matrixport said.  The crypto market cooled off Thursday after its sizable rally earlier this week spurred by spot bitcoin ETF anticipation.  Bitcoin [BTC] slipped about 2% over the past 24 hours to just above $34,000 as investors took profits following its near-20% jump over the past week. Ether [ETH] traded flat near $1,790.  The CoinDesk Market Index [CMI], which tracks the performance of a broad basket of digital assets, was down 1.3% on Thursday.  Chainlink [LINK] and adventure gold [AGLD] slumped 5% and 9%, respectively, as FTX wallets moved millions of worth of tokens to Coinbase potentially to sell, while Sam Bankman-Fried was due to testify at his criminal trial. Other sizable decliners included [SOL], [AAVE], and [BCH].  Perhaps buoyed by renewed animal spirits in crypto, traders rotated some of the proceedings into memecoins, with [DOGE] jumping nearly double-digits and [PEPE] gaining 6%, now roughly doubling its market capitalization in a week. Dog-themed token shiba inu [SHIB] also posted a sizable move but gave back most gains by late afternoon.  Equity markets extended their losing streak, dragged down by disappointing earnings reports. The S&P 500 dropped 1.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index declined 1.7%, per MarketWatch data.  What's next for bitcoin (BTC) price?  Despite taking a breather, bitcoin is very much in its fifth bull market, and the leading narrative is its perceived safe haven properties, crypto investment services firm Matrixport said in a Thursday market update.  ""The fifth bitcoin bull market appears to be primarily driven by the expectations of institutional adoption,"" the report said. ""Bitcoin's characteristics, which were traditionally associated with assets like gold and other safe-haven investments such as Treasury bonds, have led institutions to consider Bitcoin for diversifying their asset allocation.""  Matrixport analysts doubled down on their $125,000 price target for 2024 year-end.  Bloomberg analyst Jamie Coutts compared bitcoin’s recent price action to the July 2020 breakout from the $10,500 price level, which eventually led to new all-time highs.  ""Price has cleared a massive supply overhang – the largest in its history,"" Coutts noted. ""Whilst there will be pullbacks, as we saw in Q3 2020, price is confirming the bull market regime.""",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | SHIB,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/26/bitcoin-cools-off-at-34k-but-5th-bull-market-has-further-to-run-says-analyst,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/02a369c3d57b09b33c2d7468b9c28b294812956f-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Some of these clients include global financial institutions, and Dewar believes that XRP’s adoption, among them, could have a significant impact on the token’s future price pattern. Rising To $2 Financial analyst Lauren Yarpei didn’t give an exact price that XRP could attain at the start of 2024, although she noted that some other financial experts project that it could rise to as high as $2 at the start of next year. Dom Farnell, a co-founder of The Investors Center, is really bullish on the token as he labels XRP as one of the best altcoins. Although he didn’t give a timeframe, he believes that the XRP community will soon witness the token hitting a new all-time high (ATH). XRP Above $10 On the more optimistic side, crypto analyst Egrag Crypto believes that 2024 will be the year when the XRP price experiences parabolic growth. In an analysis posted on X (formerly Twitter), Egrag told their followers that the altcoin could explode 2,500% in 2024 which would mean that the XRP price climbs above $10. In another prediction, Egrag has outlined a possible XRP price move to $30, which would happen sometime in the bull market. XRP showing strength | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com XRP Price Between $14 And $17 Another crypto analyst puts the XRP price between $14 and $17 in the upcoming year. Like Egrag, the analyst sees the altcoin crossing the $10 dollar mark next year, something that would validate the expected 2,500% move upward. On a longer time frame, the analyst expects XRP to climb as high as $24 around 2026-2027. Once again, validating Egrag’s prediction for the altcoin’s price.

Thorp uses the fact that Ripple is moving into the cross-border payments sector, and capturing a good portion of that market share will send XRP surging in no time. The analyst, however, puts the timeframe for this sometime in 2027.

42392188,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2SHz,1698349611,Arbitrum Foundation Says 'Orbit' for Layer-3 Networks Now Ready for Mainnet,"The Arbitrum Foundation said new ""layer-3"" networks created via the project's ""Orbit"" program can now settle to the Arbitrum main network.  The foundation, an organization that says it's dedicated to the decentralization of Arbitrum, which is the biggest layer-2 network atop the Ethereum blockchain, made the announcement Thursday on X (formerly Twitter).  The move followed ""months of development,"" according to the post.  Orbit is a program started earlier this year that blockchain developers can use to spin up their own layer-2 or layer-3 networks, using Arbitrum's technology. Previously, these new layer-3 networks were only settling on an Arbitrum test network, according to Steven Goldfeder, CEO of Offchain Labs, the primary developer behind Arbitrum.  The Orbit program was one of the first announcements by the foundation when it was formed in March in an effort to decentralize Arbitrum. In June, Offchain Labs released Orbit documentation for developer-only networks or ""devnets.""  According to Offchain Labs, Orbit lets developers “create your own dedicated chain that settles to one of Arbitrum's layer 2 or L2 chains,” on Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, Arbitrum Goerli and Arbitrum Sepolia.  Projects including Syndr had previously disclosed that they had chosen Arbitrum's Orbit network to build on, at that point settling to Arbitrum's Goerli testnet.  The move comes as the biggest developers of Ethereum layer-2 networks, including not just Arbitrum but OP Labs (behind Optimism), Polygon and Matter Labs (behind zkSync), are making their technology available to builders to clone or modify for their own use. The idea is that the projects can derive benefits or possibly licensing or other revenue from providing the blueprint or foundation for additional networks that theoretically would be interoperable or at least compatible.  ""Today's announcement of Arbitrum Orbit's mainnet readiness as well as the initial cohort of 10 Orbit chains marks a big moment for the continued proliferation of the Arbitrum technology,"" Goldfeder told CoinDesk in a direct message.  Separately, Arbitrum Foundation said Wednesday that it has tapped Celestia, a modular solution, for Orbit to use them as data availability layer. Apps built on top of Orbit will have the option to publish their data to Celestia, once the solution goes live.  Orbit is one of many customizable blockchain stacks that have come to market over the past few months. Arbitrum’s competitor, OP Labs, behind the layer-2 chain OP Mainnet (formerly named Optimism), has its own version of a customizable environment, called the OP Stack, which currently powers crypto exchange Coinbase layer-2 network, Base.

42392178,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2Rcx,1698346940,Billionaire Ken Griffin's Citadel Securities Denies 'Ridiculous' Claim That It Tanked Do Kwon's Terraform,"Billionaire Ken Griffin's trading firm, Citadel Securities, denied a claim from Terraform Labs that it was behind the collapse of the algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) in May last year.  Earlier this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Terraform Labs and its co-founder and former CEO Do Kwon with fraud, selling unregistered securities, selling unregistered security-based swaps and other related claims. Federal prosecutors in New York also charged Do Kwon with fraud hours after he was arrested by police in Montenegro.  Citadel said in a court filing on Thursday that Terraform's claim that Citadel was behind its collapse is being used to deflect attention from its charges. ""To deflect attention from these allegations (and likely the crimes yet to be discovered), Terraform uses a motion to compel to pursue a ridiculous conspiracy theory “exposing” the purportedly hidden role of Citadel Securities in its self-imposed disaster,"" the firm said.  ""Not only is the time period of the request irrelevant, but the theory is baseless,"" Citadel added.  The filing comes after Terraform filed a motion earlier this month alleging Citadel was behind the collapse, citing social media posts. However, Citadel said the social media sources of Terraform's claims, including an account of pseudonymous user “Gigantic Rebirth,” who said Griffin divulged his plans to depeg UST over ""nice bacon rib"" lunch, is ""absurd on its face.""  The Terra network and Do Kwon rose to the highest tier of the crypto world thanks to big-shot investors, only to fall apart within a few days in May 2022. On May 7, the price of the then-$18-billion algorithmic stablecoin UST, which is supposed to maintain a $1 peg, started to wobble and fell to 35 cents on May 9. Its companion token, LUNA, which was meant to stabilize UST's price, fell from $80 to a few cents by May 12. The collapse sent a shockwave throughout the crypto sector, eventually leading to a prolonged crypto winter.  Citadel said it only engaged in two test transactions involving UST, with a collective value of ""roughly thirteen cents,"" noting that Terraform is aware that the hedge fund ""could not and did not play the role it suggests in its motion to compel.""  ""Because Terraform has no good-faith basis for its requests, the Court should reject its effort to abuse the discovery process and provide sanctions as it deems appropriate,"" the hedge fund titan said. Terra may have to pay for ""lost earnings and reasonable attorney's fees"" if the court imposes a sanction, Citadel added.

As founder Sam Bankman-Fried awaits possible conviction and faces a staggering 114 years in prison if found guilty, FTX’s asset recovery plan continues under Ray’s leadership. FTX Bankruptcy Battle Escalates In a recent filing with the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, FTX issued a subpoena to the artificial intelligence (AI) firm Center for AI Safety (CAIS), demanding accounting records and information regarding payments, agreements, and contracts related to the $6.5 million investment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Surge: Matrixport Forecasts $125,000 Price Target By December 2024 The motion, filed on behalf of the debtors who sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on November 11 and November 14, 2022, states that the Debtors are operating their businesses and managing their properties as debtors-in-possession under the Bankruptcy Code. It also highlights the appointment of an Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors by the US Trustee. FTX’s investigations have revealed that CAIS received transfers totaling at least $6.5 million in debtors’ funds between May and September 2022. As part of their ongoing efforts to understand the debtors’ financial landscape, transactions, and estate, FTX has requested CAIS to produce relevant documents and information related to payments, agreements, communications, and other pertinent details. Debtors Seek Answers According to the motion filed on October 25, despite the debtors’ attempts to engage in a cooperative dialogue and resolve the matter amicably, CAIS has rejected voluntary requests for accounting and failed to respond to formal correspondence. The filing reads: The Debtors have attempted to engage in a cooperative meet and confer process to obtain information from the CAIS voluntarily. The Debtors have so far been unsuccessful. On a phone call on August 22, 2023, counsel for CAIS expressed unwillingness to make its records related to the transfers available to the Debtors. In emails between October 2-6, 2023, Debtors requested information concerning the amount of Debtor funds CAIS has spent, the amount of Debtor funds it has retained, and its financial condition. CAIS declined to provide that information. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Upcoming Leap?

Current FTX management has said its intention is to return funds to creditors in fiat currency rather than crypto, but plans to trade the assets – which also include sizable holdings of SOL ($1.6B) bitcoin ($560M) and ether ($192M) —– carefully to avoid flooding the market and crashing prices. Along those lines, the company in August hired Galaxy Digital for assistance in executing those sales.  Though GBTC wasn’t explicitly mentioned in those plans, the news is ostensibly good for those hoping the fund’s discount to net asset value (NAV) won’t be negatively affected by an FTX fire sale.  GBTC is the world’s largest crypto fund and – following the recent rally in bitcoin – has more than $21 billion in assets (all bitcoin) under management. After trading at a discount to NAV that widened to as much as 50% last year, the GBTC discount has narrowed to roughly 15% of late amid a return of bull spirits to bitcoin and optimism Grayscale might soon win U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval to convert the fund to a spot ETF. Much of that optimism can be traced to Grayscale's mid-August major court victory where it was ruled the SEC was “arbitrary and capricious” in denying the ETF conversion.  A wrench, however, may have been thrown in by a lawsuit last week filed by the State of New York against Grayscale’s parent company Digital Currency Group which had some analysts speculating the SEC may have been given a reason to once again deny the conversion. Digital Currency Group is also the parent company of CoinDesk.  FTX crypto sales and GBTC  According to Scott Jonhsson, a general partner at Van Buren Capital, a plan of reorganization for the FTX bankruptcy isn't likely to be confirmed before the second quarter of 2024 and speculators are expecting a decision from the SEC over spot bitcoin ETFs before that.  “In that case, we should have a pretty clear view at that point if spot BTC ETFs (including GBTC) are approved and trading,” said Johnsson.  Johnsson explained that if GBTC has converted to an ETF by that point, any sales of GBTC from the FTX estate should have a similar effect as if FTX was selling spot BTC. “The selling wouldn’t create or widen any discount to GBTC since the creation and redemption process for the ETF should just track the underlying BTC price,” said Johnsson.  However, there is a chance that the SEC rejects Grayscale’s application on the basis of an alternate reason and Johnsson explains that this might be negative for the discount. “If GBTC has not converted at that point, then you would expect FTX estate sales to put pressure on the discount and perhaps cause it to widen.”  Sean Farrell, head of crypto strategy at Fundstrat, echoes Johnsson’s thoughts. “The SEC's approval of a spot ETF would undeniably aid in ensuring creditors are made whole. We'd witness a more pronounced narrowing of the discount to NAV in GBTC, and it's probable that crypto asset prices would surge overall, given the positive catalyst.”  He goes on to say that if the SEC does not approve the ETFs the discount will likely widen. “But at this point we see a very low probability that the spot ETF does not get approved,” added Farrell.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/26/what-happens-to-gbtc-discount-when-ftx-sells-its-holdings,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d9180848b8301d8f2a26afc9e67c96de8e329cf2-1622x912.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42392187,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2SSF,1698346551,The Hamas Funding Story Is Why Crypto Is Sick of the Mainstream Media,"“It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it,” the writer Upton Sinclair famously said.  And so it goes with people who continue to push the idea that Palestinian terror is funded by crypto donations.  Let’s just say it: They don’t accept the truth because the lie is more convenient.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The Wall Street Journal erroneously reported last week that Hamas, and associated terror groups, had received tens of millions of dollars in crypto and that the money was being used to back the current war in the Middle East.  Blockchain analytics firms, including Chainalysis and Elliptic, have since refuted the idea, saying the funding was likely in the range of a few thousand dollars. But those statements haven’t swayed the Wall Street Journal into making a correction and it hasn’t stopped prominent members of Congress, including Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown, from continuing to push for a broad crypto crackdown.  Today, Brown, who heads the powerful Senate Banking Committee, called for additional action against financing of terrorism, including cryptocurrency, and it seems many members of Congress are now willing to believe that the mere existence of cryptocurrency is a boon to people who kill and maim. Last week, following the WSJ report, 102 lawmakers wrote to the U.S. Treasury Department, demanding information as to what is being done to prevent the use of crypto to finance terrorism.  Talk about “impact journalism.” The WSJ report has created a groundswell in Congress to crack down on crypto, even though the data behind its claims is clearly wrong.  Elliptic, whose data was misinterpreted in the WSJ report, says the “most prominent public crypto fundraising campaign has been operated by Gaza Now, a pro-Hamas news organization."" And that is only to the tune of $21,000 – money that has apparently been largely frozen by the authorities.  Nic Carter, a prominent VC and CoinDesk columnist, has led calls for the WSJ to retract its story, lest the idea of crypto funding Hamas et al. take hold. But his campaign might be too late. Even if the WSJ does correct, Congress is already running with the notion, and facts in this sort of context have a tendency to become irrelevant. Hundreds of thousands of ordinary, casual observers of crypto/Congress/Hamas now believe something that isn’t true.  All of which makes it easy to understand why many in the crypto industry are tired of centralized media. They’ve struggled to get balanced coverage over the years and they’re reflexively antagonistic to journalists who present them as priests of the truth when they clearly have an ax to grind.  As a journalist who has covered this industry for nine years, this antagonistic attitude has sometimes been hard to take. Most of us journalists are doing our best to get the story right and it’s tough being painted with a broad brush. Not all journalists are the same, just like not everyone in the crypto industry is Sam Bankman-Fried.  But seeing the Hamas funding storyline play out, it’s hard not to be sympathetic to people in crypto who are tired of reporters getting facts wrong. Following the debunkings by Elliptic, Chainanalysis and many others, the WSJ could easily have corrected its reporting. But it has chosen not to, even as it has a direct bearing on policy-making at the highest level.  That’s an indictment of the mainstream media and a reinforcement of Sinclair’s dictum. The only possible explanation for why Warren, the WSJ and others are continuing to push a notion that is clearly untrue is that they don’t want to know the truth. It’s inconvenient to their goals and their egos, so they continue to peddle a lie.",NEGATIVE,없음,REGULATION,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/26/the-hamas-funding-story-is-why-crypto-is-sick-of-the-mainstream-media,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/06382b3ed8751ec23e0823bc1ed77d428223370e-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This projection, shared in a recent post on X (formerly known as Twitter), has caught the attention of many, given its bullish outlook amid the present market landscape. Related Reading: Crypto’s Red Alert: Is War Pushing Bitcoin To $1 Million? Arthur Hayes Weighs In Bitcoin Enters Mid-Cycle Phase Four Based on CryptoCon’s research, Bitcoin has embarked on its fourth mid-cycle phase. It is worth noting that such categorized phases are integral in understanding the potential trajectory of a cryptocurrency. This new phase suggests that Bitcoin is on a path to reach the “mid-top” of its cycle, which, according to CryptoCon, is around the $45,500 mark. CryptoCon further elaborated that there’s typically a swift transition to phase five after the second phase’s conclusion. Given this pattern, the prediction is that Bitcoin could reach the speculated $45,000 price point soon. However, a key hurdle remains. For Bitcoin to ascend to this new height, it must first breach the $36,368 resistance level, the analyst disclosed. Welcome to Mid-Cycle phase 4 This is the time when #Bitcoin is in between heading to the cycle Mid-Top which is now about 45.5k. Price has typically come over this.

CryptoCon’s assessment indicates that a leap to the “mid-top” typically occurs approximately two months after the closure of the second phase. The anticipation grows stronger as the first of these two months draws to a close. If the pattern holds and Bitcoin maintains its current momentum, we might witness it touch the $45,500 mark as we usher in November, the analyst concluded, noting: Since our first month is about to come to a close in phase 4, the mid-top could be complete as soon as November. Translation: A possible move above 45k by next month. It is worth noting that CryptoCon isn’t the only analyst sharing predictions on Bitcoin’s trajectory. Stephan Livera, Swan Bitcoin’s Head of Education, recently disclosed his projections for Bitcoin’s future. Livera believes Bitcoin could reach around $500,000 by 2025 or early 2026. Yet, this ascent might not be without its challenges, possibly seeing a significant decline after reaching that peak. Drawing comparisons with gold, Livera suggests that BTC could exhibit a similar valuation pattern. “So, it might go to $500k and then crash to $100k,” Swan Bitcoin’s Head of Education remarked.

42419324,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEFzh,1698341905,"U.S. Lawmakers Lummis, Hill Urge DOJ Decision on Charging Binance, Tether for Aiding Hamas","U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-Wy.) and Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.) have urged the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to ""expeditiously conclude"" investigations and reach a decision on criminal charges for Binance and Tether concerning possible aid to Hamas.  ""On October 10, 2023, the Wall Street Journal reported that Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah have received funding through crypto assets since August 2021, though subsequent reports have highlighted that the level of funding reported in the article is likely not accurate,"" the lawmakers wrote in a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland. ""However, we believe it is nonetheless imperative that the Department of Justice hold bad actors accountable if they are shown to facilitate illicit activity.""  The request is notable because it comes from two historical advocates for regulation of crypto. Senator Lummis is a member of the influential Senate Banking Committee, has drafted a bill on crypto and continues to press to get crypto legislation through Congress. In August, she also called on a federal court to dismiss a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against crypto exchange Coinbase.  Rep. Hill is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Digital Assets House Financial Services Committee and has occupied a leading role as that congressional panel has been pushing for crypto legislation.  In a blog post on Thursday, Tether pushed back against the reports.  “It is critical to realize that imprecise information not only fosters unwarranted concerns but also paints an unfair and skewed picture of Tether and the industry as a whole,” the company argued. “There is simply no evidence that Tether has violated sanctions laws or the Bank Secrecy Act through inadequate customer due diligence or screening practices.”  The U.S. lawmakers' letter said that while some reports claim Binance is now cooperating with authorities, this is immaterial to criminal culpability, because ""Binance is only doing so after knowingly allowing its exchange to be used by terrorist organizations, and only after they have been caught.""  Lummis and Hill alleged that it is well-known that Tether knowingly facilitated the violations of sanctions by failing to conduct adequate customer due diligence despite knowing its product is used to facilitate terrorism.  Binance and Tether did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The level of available bitcoin on crypto exchanges – liquid tokens investors can easily buy and sell – has dropped 2.3 million, its lowest reading since April 2018, Glassnode data shows. That's down from 2.6 million a year ago and 3.2 million at its peak in May 2020.  Meanwhile, there's roughly 3 million tokens that haven't been moved in ten years, said Weller. That compares to the current overall supply of 19.5 million and bitcoin's maximum-ever supply of 21 million.  ""That's suggestive of a potential supply shock,"" Weller said. ""With lower supply on the market, it only takes a small bump in demand to really drive prices higher at a rapid rate.""  Weller said that spot ETFs, unlike futures-based products, could ""fundamentally alter the supply and demand picture"" for bitcoin, making it available for a new set of investors. That's especially so now that bitcoin has regained its ""uncorrelated asset"" lure by decoupling from equities and rallying as U.S. stocks have entered correction territory, he added.

19414774,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557729,1698339619,"Bitcoin Price Surge: Matrixport Forecasts $125,000 Price Target By December 2024","Bitcoin price (BTC) is currently displaying a significant uptrend, showing no signs of slowing down. The cryptocurrency has already begun its fifth bull run, with impressive price targets anticipated in the coming year. A recent report from Matrixport highlights BTC’s history of four distinct bull market cycles, each driven by a unique narrative. However, the latest bull market, which started on June 22, 2023, stands out due to its primary driving force: institutional adoption. Per the report, this surge in institutional interest can be attributed to Bitcoin’s characteristics, traditionally associated with safe-haven investments like Gold, as well as mounting concerns over the United States debt-to-GDP ratio. Matrixport’s report predicts that Bitcoin’s price could reach an impressive $125,000 by December 2024. Bitcoin Price Rise Aligns With Mounting US Debt Matrixport suggests its emergence as a new payment mechanism propelled the first Bitcoin bull market in 2011. The second cycle was driven by China, where Bitcoin gained recognition as an alternative form of money. The rise of initial coin offerings (ICOs) marked the third cycle, providing a novel means of establishing and funding companies. The fourth cycle saw the decentralized finance (DeFi) summer and the NFT craze dominating the market. However, per the report, Bitcoin’s current bull market is driven by institutional adoption. Institutions are considering Bitcoin for diversifying their asset allocation due to its characteristics akin to safe-haven investments. Related Reading: SHIB Will Lose Place To PEPE In New Bull Cycle, Analyst Makes The Case Notably, the surge in Bitcoin’s value coincides with the United States’ escalating debt-to-GDP ratio, making it an attractive choice for institutions seeking to hedge against potential economic instability. Based on historical price signals, Matrixport estimated that Bitcoin price could reach $125,000 by December 2024. Interestingly, the report suggests that the onset of this bull market was officially recognized when BTC reached a new one-year high on June 22, 2023. Furthermore, Matrixport advises that the optimal entry point to buy Bitcoin is ideally 14-16 months before the next halving event. The report suggested that the end of October 2022 was an opportune time to enter the market when Bitcoin traded at $17,000. Potential BTC Correction On The Horizon? Despite the hype surrounding the current uptrend experienced by most cryptocurrencies on the market, crypto analyst “Crypto Soulz” presents a contrasting view on the future of Bitcoin price. In a recent analysis of X (formerly Twitter), the analyst provides several reasons for considering a short position on BTC. According to Crypto Soulz, the next significant resistance level is at $37,330, but Soulz doubts the possibility of retesting it in the current market conditions. Related Reading: Still Not Bullish On Solana? 4 New Reasons Why You Should Be Bitcoin recently reached a local top at $35,300, leading Crypto Soulz to believe a price decline may follow. The analyst emphasizes retesting the $31,500 level as crucial support, which Bitcoin did not revisit during the recent price surge. Crypto Soulz notes that spot and perpetual contracts rose during the pump, indicating potential market instability. Additionally, the futures market experienced significant liquidations during the rally, similar to previous wipe-outs in January and August. Upon examining the liquidation heatmap, Crypto Soulz identifies liquidity below the current price, implying a potential downward movement. Soulz targets specific liquidity pools at $32,300 and $30,800 as potential areas for the price decline. Based on its analysis, Crypto Soulz expects Bitcoin to “cool off” from its current levels and target lower prices. At the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin is currently at $34,000, experiencing a 2.5% retracement in the past 24 hours.

42419336,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEGA1,1698336862,U.S. Senate's Banking Chairman Says Panel to 'Crack Down' on Crypto's Terrorism Ties,"U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said the panel will ""crack down on the use of crypto to fund terrorism and evade sanctions"" at a time when the U.S. must stand with Israel as it combats ""Iranian-backed terrorists like Hamas.""  ""We can work to cut off funding for terrorism at its source,"" said Brown, who could have an outsized role in crypto policymaking as head of the panel that oversees U.S. financial watchdogs. The senator said during a Thursday hearing on illicit finance that his committee ""will examine multiple terrorist funding streams, including cryptocurrency, and consider additional measures to stop the flow of those funds.""  Recent reports about the role of crypto in the Israel-Hamas conflict misinterpreted and hugely exaggerated data, according to blockchain analytical firm Elliptic. Chainalysis, a rival analytics firm, made a similar statement earlier last week.  On October 10, The Wall Street Journal linked Hamas with tens of millions in crypto donations. But Elliptic said this week that, while Hamas ""has begun to experiment"" with digital-asset fundraising, ""the amounts raised remain tiny compared to other funding sources.""  As one of the WSJ's main sources for data pushes back on the accuracy of the reporting, many crypto proponents have asked the WSJ to correct the record.  In the hearing, Sen. Brown mentioned fellow committee member Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), among more than 100 other U.S. lawmakers who urged federal agencies last week to cork the flow of crypto to terrorists. Backed by the WSJ's earlier reporting, Warren led that major response, further justifying her legislative push to go after money laundering and sanctions abuses in crypto.  ""I’m glad that members of this committee ... have put forward bipartisan plans for closing gaps around digital assets in our illicit finance rules,"" Brown said, also referring to a legislative initiative from Sen. Jack Reed and others to demand decentralized finance (DeFi) projects meet similar standards as traditional financial firms. ""We’ll work together on this committee, in a bipartisan way, to make sure terrorists and bad actors can’t exploit crypto.""  Warren's office didn't respond to an earlier CoinDesk request for comment on the confusion over Hamas's crypto relationships. The Blockchain Innovation Project – led by two former members of Congress, David McIntosh, an Indiana Republican, and Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat – sent a letter to the Massachusetts senator and others to counter the lawmakers' recent claims.  Brown, who argued that crypto platforms don't use common-sense safeguards that ""keep illicit money out of the traditional banking system,"" has been a vocal critic of the industry, especially in the period after the collapse of FTX. But his committee would have to consider and approve any serious piece of digital assets legislation.  And he said last week’s steps taken by the U.S. Treasury to sanction several individuals and entities allegedly supporting Hamas terrorist operations, including a Gaza-based exchange, are ""not enough.“  ""The administration must take additional steps to impose sanctions and dedicate resources toward a multilateral effort to coordinate with allies to track, freeze, and seize any Hamas-related assets, and take steps necessary to deny Hamas terrorists the ability to raise funds,” he added.  Iran is widely understood to be the main sponsor of Palestinian terror groups currently at war with Israel.  Attempts to block crypto funding for terrorism often become a game of whack-a-mole, Brown noted, because law enforcement may stop one transaction while criminals move to another platform, using another alias. “Terrorists know they can use crypto in ways they could never use dollars.”  Read More: Media Reported Hamas Got Millions Via Crypto, but the Data Provider They Cited Says It Was Misconstrued  UPDATE 10/26/23; 16:40 UTC: This story was updated with additional comments from Sherrod Brown.

Right now, all things seem poised for a retracement, considering past price action of the cryptocurrency after sudden price surges. However, according to some crypto analysts, Bitcoin is currently trading at a high premium. This means its price is inflated right now due to all the excitement and media attention. Data from crypto behavior analytics Santiment has shown euphoria regarding Bitcoin among investors on social media posts. This euphoria has occasionally preceded a decline in the price of BTC. MN Trading analyst Daan Foppen warns that the cryptocurrency is currently trading at a significant premium, noting the best time to buy is at a discount price. Analyst Recommend Waiting For The Next Dip To Buy Bitcoin’s current surge can likely be attributed to FOMO from investors regarding the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. This FOMO was reinforced by the emergence of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust on the DTCC website. Related Reading: Top 3 XRP Developments You Should Be Aware Of That Could Boost Price The Bitcoin Trust was removed from the DTCC website without explanation, leading to an ongoing consolidation and a pause in the price surge. However, the listing has since returned, with slight changes. Although analyst Daan Foppen credited this recent Bitcoin price spike as a good sign for bulls, he warned that the price is “currently trading in a bearish monthly fair value gap (FVG).” A good step right now is to keep an eye on the monthly close for a potential change in a scenario that will show the next direction after the current consolidation. Foppen believes a monthly close that is higher than $31,800 will solidify the beginning of a longer-term bullish momentum, while a close below the $31,800 mark will prove the bears are still in control. “We had a convincing break above the most recent high of 31.8K which is crucial for further upside momentum. If we close the candle like this, we can say that we have printed another higher high. If we close below 31.8K, my thesis will change from bull to bear, but for now, we have nothing to worry about,” Foppen said. According to Foppen, a better strategy before buying it is to wait for discount prices at previous resistance levels. The analyst made this analysis by sharing various BTC price charts on different timeframes. Source: MN Trading While examining the 1-hour timeframe, he noted the best discount price for cautious traders could be at the “untested order block around $31,000, which is in line with the previous range high.” Source: MN Trading What’s Next For Bitcoin? At the moment, Bitcoin is trading at a premium, meaning it’s on the higher end of its typical range. However, considering the volatility and still-nascent phase of the crypto industry, it can be somewhat difficult to use Bitcoin’s past performance to predict future outcomes.

42419345,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEGHF,1698335100,Crypto for Advisors: ETH Futures ETFs and What’s Next,"Bitcoin has passed the $30,000 mark this week, with many speculating that the trading activity is due to an impending U.S. bitcoin spot ETF approval after the Securities and Exchange Commission announced it would not pursue an appeal in the case against Grayscale.  With our eyes on US ETF approvals, Roxanna Islam from VettaFi provides insights into the recent ETH activity and its “lackluster” performance. She discusses what could be coming in the crypto ETF space.  Advisors, our bitcoin ETF survey is open for one more week. We will be announcing the results next week. Please take a moment to fill it out.  Happy reading.  – S.M.  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Ethereum Futures ETFs: What’s Next?  It has been several weeks since ether futures ETFs launched with little fanfare in early October. Where do they stand now and what are investors watching for in the crypto ETF market? These are three observations.  Less fanfare than expected … but we already knew that.  When the first U.S. bitcoin futures ETF was launched, it made a huge impact. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) was launched on Oct. 18, 2021, and it was the second-highest traded ETF in existence. Turnover was over $1 billion on the first day, while all seven ether futures ETFs traded only $7 million on Oct. 7. But this was a different time. Bitcoin prices were at their peak at over $69,000, and Ethereum prices were similarly at their peak at over $4,800. Mainstream investors were a lot more excited about crypto, and bitcoin futures ETFs were able to ride that wave. Additionally, ether itself has less popularity than bitcoin; the market share for bitcoin is about 51% vs. 17% for ether. But while ether broadly has less demand than bitcoin, this was still a space in the market that needed to be filled – particularly for investors who want to use ETFs to capture the full crypto market in their portfolio.  Spot bitcoin ETFs spotted ahead—what about spot ether ETFs?  For months, investors have heard about the benefits of spot vs. futures ETFs. The main disadvantage of futures bitcoin ETFs are the roll costs, which can cause a performance lag from the performance of spot bitcoin. So with spot bitcoin ETFs on the horizon, it makes sense that investors would be waiting for spot ether ETFs to launch. Spot bitcoin ETFs may be approved as soon as the end of the year or early 2024 at the latest (Jan. 10 is the final deadline for Ark’s spot bitcoin product, so this is an important date to watch).  A few days ago, the deadline passed for SEC to appeal the Grayscale court decision, which is overall good news for spot bitcoin ETF approval. Since then, several issuers have amended their spot bitcoin applications including Blackrock, Fidelity, and Ark. Most of the updates seem to be standard disclosures or clarifications about the market environment, so there’s not much to read into it with the exact updates given. But it means that this SEC is communicating with these issuers and possibly having back and forth discussions.So while there’s no guarantee of approval, it is still a good sign.  There are around 12 spot bitcoin ETFs awaiting approval, which will likely all be approved around the same time (much like we saw with the ether futures ETF launch). There are also five filings for spot ether ETFs (including a Grayscale conversion) which may potentially be approved after spot bitcoin ETFs are approved in 2024. Once these spot products are launched, we will likely see less overall demand for futures bitcoin and ether ETFs.  What does it mean for the crypto market?  News about crypto ETFs moves the crypto market as we have experienced recently. On Oct. 16, there was a rumor that an iShares spot ETF product was approved. That was later refuted but not before the price of bitcoin spiked 10%, which shows that an approval hasn’t quite yet been priced into the market. While 10% seems relatively small, the market likely didn’t have time to fully react given that the news was debunked quickly. I think when these spot ETFs are actually approved, we could see a much greater, sustained price spike and renewed investor interest in crypto. Much of this demand may come from retail investors who want to invest in bitcoin or ether through their traditional brokerage accounts.  – Roxanna Islam, CFA, CAIA, Head of Sector & Industry Research, VettaFi  Bitcoin ETF Survey  If or when a bitcoin spot etf is approved, will you invest for your clients?

The frog-themed memecoin was one of the beacons of optimism in the recent bear market, rising to a $1.6 billion market cap in early May as traders speculated over whether it could rival the likes of dogecoin [DOGE] and shiba inu [SHIB].  The hype rapidly wore off as the market cap slipped to $244 million earlier this month, but it now appears to have found a way out of the doldrums with a significant uptick in trading volume and on-chain activity.  On Wednesday, a post on pepe's X page revealed that more than 155,000 individual wallets were holding pepe, including all token bridges to Arbitrum and BSC. Trading volume reached $423 million over the past 24 hours, a 22% rise from the previous day, according to CoinMarketCap.  The recent gain can be attributed to a $5.5 million token burn that took place on Tuesday, which alleviated fears of a rogue developer potentially selling tokens on the open market.  Pepe wasn't the only memecoin to experience upside – dogecoin and shiba inu both enjoyed notable rallies Thursday as traders began to trade more speculative assets.  The sector's positive performance comes after bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, surged to a 16-month high of $35,000 alongside growing optimism that a spot ETF will soon win approval in the U.S.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | SHIB,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/10/26/pepecoin-doubles-to-500m-market-cap-as-memecoin-fever-steals-bitcoins-etf-thunder,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1e54850707481ccc2b82bee8f5b4f7922b91501b-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Recently, an emerging meme coin called $MEME, which has no roadmap or utility has already raised over $11 million in its ongoing firesale. Memecoin (MEME) Achieves A Major Milestone With Firesale MEME is an Ethereum-based memecoin that operates under the ERC-20 network, with a total supply of 69 billion MEME tokens. The token was designed by a web3 startup called Memeland and launched by the team that worked on 9GAG. According to the Memecoin fire sale page, the brand new meme coin reportedly sold over 11.4 billion MEME tokens selling at $0.001 in its ongoing firesale. This indicates a significant 150% surge, beating the team’s expectations from the very beginning. The token’s active firesale which has amassed over $11 million already has done this despite being a waitlist-only sale. Related Reading: AiDoge Reaches $9 Million Mark in Presale, Looks Set for More Milestones In line with Memecoin’s whitepaper, the team highlighted that the token “has no functions, no utility and no intrinsic value, no promise or expectation of any financial return, profit, interest or dividend.” The team further asserts that in regard to the Memeland ecosystem, the Memecoin does not represent “any entitlement to any voting rights.” However, despite the meme coin not having a roadmap, utility, and future return, it did not sway crypto investors from purchasing the meme coin. In addition, the crypto community is still eager to buttress the startup, demonstrating crypto investors’ trust and faith in the new meme coin. According to data from MEME’s tokenomics, it was revealed that the first 2.7% of the total supply of the MEME token will be released on October 27. Meanwhile, the remaining portion will be “unlocked daily over the course of eighteen months.” Meme Coin Captures Crypto Investors’ Interest The cryptocurrency community’s interest in the newly introduced MEME token can be traced back to the future profit potentials of meme coins. Meme coins can offer huge investment returns for investors, although they can also be risky for those who do not engage in proper research before investing in the tokens. One notable meme coin that has garnered huge returns for investors and produced hundreds of millionaires in the 2021 bull run is the Shiba Inu (SHIB) meme coin. Related Reading: The Battle of Memecoins: EverLodge vs Shiba Inu – Which Holds the Key to Success? The Dogecoin rival was launched in 2020 but later rose to fame in 2021 after significant price surges. The token has managed to remain a vital meme coin to this day. The Shiba Inu was launched with an initial price of $0.000000001009, according to CoinMarketCap. By May 2021, the token was traded at $0.00003469, indicating an over 10,000% surge in price.

42419329,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEG2n,1698329077,"Media Reported Hamas Got Millions Via Crypto, but the Data Provider They Cited Says It Was Misconstrued","After Hamas' deadly attacks in Israel, media reports linked the terrorist group with tens of millions in crypto donations, but that data was misinterpreted and hugely exaggerated, according to the blockchain analytical firm that was cited.  In response, a Wall Street Journal reporter has suggested the data company, Elliptic, told a different story in July. Ian Talley, the journalist, was one of the authors of the Oct. 10 Journal piece that noted more than $90 million in crypto went to terrorist groups, attributing the claim to Elliptic data.  In a blog post this week, Elliptic said that while Hamas ""has begun to experiment"" with digital-asset fundraising, ""the amounts raised remain tiny compared to other funding sources.""  Elliptic said the company has been in contact with the newspaper to clarify this point. The newspaper didn't immediately respond to CoinDesk's requests for comment, but Talley took to X on Wednesday in an attempt to contrast Elliptic's current statements with its post in July that the newspaper relied on.  The reporter highlighted portions of the July post that said cited Israeli seizures of ""crypto wallets worth $94 million linked to Palestinian Islamic Jihad,"" which coordinates with Hamas.  Allegations of a crypto-Hamas storyline sparked a major response from more than 100 U.S. lawmakers, including U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who leaned into the reports to further justify her legislative push to go after money laundering and sanctions abuses in crypto. The more recent post from Elliptic suggests the terrorism-funding problem may be far less pointed.  ""The most prominent public crypto fundraising campaign has been operated by Gaza Now, a pro-Hamas news organization,"" according to Elliptic. ""However, only $21,000 in cryptocurrency has been donated since October 7th, and thanks to the efforts of crypto businesses and researchers, much of this has been frozen.""  Meanwhile, Elliptic noted that the other side of the ledger – charitable giving to support the victims of violence there – has received much more than that.  Also this week, the Blockchain Innovation Project – led by two former members of Congress, David McIntosh, an Indiana Republican, and Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat – sent a letter to Sen. Warren and others to counter the lawmakers' recent claims.  Warren's office didn't respond to a request for comment on the confusion.  The crypto connection to terrorism in that region is present to some degree, however, noted by the U.S. Department of the Treasury when it targeted Hamas-supporting crypto wallets – and at least one business that handled bitcoin transactions.  As Elliptic noted in its blog post, Hamas said it stopped fundraising in crypto in April, with the group noting that blockchains are a danger because they expose supporters to the authorities.

An analyst presented a bullish case for PEPE, which could directly impact SHIB’s position in the meme coin market. Related Reading: Top 3 XRP Developments You Should Be Aware Of That Could Boost Price As of this writing, PEPE has considerably outperformed SHIB and other memecoins. PEPE records a 14% increase in the last 24 hours alone and a 90% increase over the past two weeks, while SHIB records an 18% profit over the same period. SHIB Investors Should Fear PEPE’s Impact? An analyst believes that PEPE’s current price action will extend beyond the early stages of the current Bull Cycle, following a successful break out beyond the 7730 and 8127; as seen in the chart below, the cryptocurrency hit a critical resistance level. The analyst stated: $PEPE That was a quick move upon retaking the range. First target at 10800 reached but ultimately I am holding a spot bag of this for the cycle to come. Still stand by the idea that $PEPE will be this cycle’s $SHIB. However, the analyst believes that PEPE’s rally is barely starting. The cryptocurrency reclaimed an important area and could continue to climb beyond its all-time high and into uncharted territory during the bull cycle. Altcoins To Watch In Upcoming Cycle PEPE is one of the altcoins the analyst is keeping an eye on. In addition to the meme coin, the trader expects the NFT and staking sectors to bloom in the coming months. Apecoin’s APE and LidoDAO’s LDO have been rallying due to the current bullish momentum in the market. LDO alone could hit the $2 target in the short term and continue its run higher into the $3 territory. Other cryptocurrencies to watch if these sectors trend to the upside are ETH, DOGE, BLUR, and ORDI. On APE, the analyst stated: APE So far so good. Pretty strong and about to test an important high timeframe resistance area. Clear this and I think we can look for ~$1.8 next. If NFTs bounce as well that would help this.

42419341,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEGFB,1698327000,"Sam Bankman-Fried's Jurors Were Sent Home for the Day, but His Debut on the Stand Was Significant Anyway","Sam Bankman-Fried's testimony began Thursday without the jury present so the judge overseeing the case could review the FTX founder's comments first.  The former CEO placed blame on FTX's attorneys for the collapse of the multi-billion-dollar crypto exchange – a seeming attempt to deflect responsibility.  Prosecutors got to cross-examine him, too, and it didn't go well for SBF.  NEW YORK — Sam Bankman-Fried began testifying at his criminal trial Thursday without jurors present, an unusual move by the judge who wanted to review the comments first to see if they're admissible.  Even though jurors weren't there to hear him, Bankman-Fried's first performance on the witness stand – delivered while he was under oath – was remarkable.  The FTX founder's decision to testify is risky. While Bankman-Fried has tried to frame the collapse of his multi-billion-dollar FTX crypto exchange as an unavoidable accident – he gave interviews to reporters, started a Substack newsletter and tweeted to downplay his culpability after his company filed for bankruptcy in November 2022 – he has exposed himself to tough questioning from prosecutors.  On Thursday, Bankman-Fried answered his own lawyer's queries in crisp, polished tones that differed from the uncertain responses he gave during a ""Good Morning America"" interview a year ago after his empire crumbled. The former CEO placed blame on FTX's attorneys for the collapse of the multi-billion-dollar crypto exchange – a seeming attempt to deflect responsibility.  But prosecutors got to cross-examine him, too, in this jury-less session. The grilling from Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon – which normally would take place after the defense has a chance to fully air its argument – did not go well for Bankman-Fried and showed precisely how testifying in a case like this can backfire for a defendant.  Certain lines of questioning from Sassoon seemed to catch Bankman-Fried off-guard.  ""I'd like you to point out where in this agreement it is specified that Alameda is allowed to spend customer funds,"" she said at one point, getting at the heart of the fraud and conspiracy accusations he faces: that he stole clients' money. She said this after pulling up a “Payment Agent Agreement” between FTX and Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried's trading firm that is accused of spending billions of dollars that belonged to FTX customers.  Whereas he was able to answer questions from his own lawyers without skipping a beat, Bankman-Fried took nearly two minutes to scan over the document. When he did come up with an answer – pointing, with a seeming lack of confidence, at a passage in the middle of the page – he admitted that he's ""not a lawyer"" and couldn't be sure of his interpretation.  In response to other questions, Bankman-Fried would pause and mouth words to himself in an apparent struggle to come up with anything to say – a stark contrast to his verbosity earlier in the hearing.  Occasionally, Bankman-Fried would look upwards for an extended period, eyes darting as if searching for the optimal answer to a given query. When Bankman-Fried did answer, his responses were almost always lengthy and meandering – couched in terms like ""probably,"" ""I think,"" and ""to my best estimate."" Frequently, though, he simply said: ""I don't recall,"" such as when he was asked whether he recalled a conversation about how $13 billion had gone missing at the company – a discussion described earlier in the trial by prosecution witness Nishad Singh, a member of Bankman-Fried's FTX inner circle who has pleaded guilty.  SBF's defense  Previously, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan blocked Bankman-Fried's team from raising issues like an ""advice-of-counsel"" defense without explicit permission from the court. But in Thursday's hearing, arguments around Bankman-Fried's legal advice at FTX were fair game, since the jurors had been sent home.  The defense argued in a Wednesday filing that Bankman-Fried planned to testify to the role of his lawyers as part of his defense strategy, and Judge Kaplan said he wanted to preview his argument in more detail before deciding whether jurors could hear it.  In the lead-up to Thurday's testimony, prosecutors drew attention to FTX's practice of ""auto-deleting"" certain internal communications – a possible sign, in their telling, that Bankman-Fried and his team had something to hide.  According to Bankman-Fried, however, his external general counsel was the architect of the policy that led him to automatically delete things in Signal – a messaging app FTX used internally for communications. Bankman-Fried also said his lawyers were behind FTX's terms of service and its banking arrangement with Alameda, Bankman-Fried's trading firm. Both subjects are core to prosecutors' case against him.  Bankman-Fried specifically named general counsel Dan Friedberg as well as external law firm Fenwick & West as creating many of the documents and policies in question.  Prosecutors cross-examine the former crypto titan  Assistant U.S. Attorney Sassoon picked apart Bankman-Fried's responses to his defense attorney's earlier questions.  ""I'm not actually sure,"" he said about retaining Signal messages in response to subpoenas. It was an uncertain response similar to ones he gave to other questions asked by the prosecution.  At times, Bankman-Fried ramblingly asserted his recollection of the events leading up to FTX's collapse was foggy. The twists and turns of his testimony visibly frustrated the prosecution, but that didn't deter Bankman-Fried from launching into unusually long explanations of his decision-making at FTX or bickering with the prosecution over semantics.  ""I apologize,"" Bankman-Fried warned before Sassoon cut him off. ""This will be a somewhat substantial digression.""  At times, his tough-to-parse testimony caught the attention of Judge Kaplan.  ""The witness has what I simply call an interesting way of responding to questions,"" Kaplan observed as he weighed in on a particularly contentious conversation between the defense and prosecution over the scope of the cross-examination.  The jurors  Bankman-Fried's Thursday comments are a preview of arguments he may present to the jury when they return to the courtroom. He took the stand in the Manhattan courtroom around 2 p.m. ET, but the jurors were then sent home for the day so the judge could hear from the FTX founder first about certain aspects of his testimony and decide what is admissible – a rare step.  ""It may be a little bit of a surprise,"" Judge Kaplan told jurors, but ""you've got the rest of the day off."" Judge Kaplan, who said this is not something he's done in years, also told them the case will likely wrap up in the first half of next week. ""We're in the home stretch,"" he said.  Cohen had tried to dismiss the prosecution’s case after the U.S. Department of Justice rested its case earlier in the day, arguing insufficient evidence had been provided so far to support a conviction. This is a common procedural move that Judge Kaplan denied.  The prosecution rested its case after calling one last witness, FBI special agent Marc Troiano, to show that Bankman-Fried used the auto-deletion setting for the majority of his Signal conversations.  The defense then called as witnesses Krystal Rolle, a Bahamas attorney who represented Bankman-Fried, followed by financial services expert and consultant Joseph Pimbley. Then came Bankman-Fried's turn.  The former exchange CEO is accused of misusing his customers' and investors' funds, to the tune of over $8 billion lost by the time FTX filed for Chapter 11 in November 2022. The Department of Justice has argued over the past few weeks that Bankman-Fried directed various actions that let Alameda Research – another of his firms – misappropriate funds and then hid losses until the ""house of cards"" abruptly collapsed.  Bankman-Fried's former colleagues and inner circle – former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, former FTX Director of Engineering Nishad Singh and former FTX Chief Technology Officer Gary Wang – all testified against him, telling a jury in the New York courtroom that he specifically directed them to allow Alameda to tap FTX customer funds and to hide those actions from the companies' investors.

19406117,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557640,1698325213,"Anatomy Of A Bull Market: The Bitcoin Roadmap To $70,000","Through bull and bear rallies, crypto analysts have always given their forecast for where the price of a crypto like bitcoin might end up. Mostly, this is the norm, but one analyst has taken a deeper dive into the coin to give an in-depth analysis of Bitcoin’s upward rally. The analysis touches on multiple indicators, as well as the widespread acceptance that BTC has been gaining recently. Bitcoin Price To $70,000 The analysis shared on TradingView shows a different side of the market that has previously been untapped. The analyst who goes by ArShevelev identifies the period between March and August as the ‘Stealth Phase’, which is likely where most of the accumulation occurred. Related Reading: A Chance At Redemption: Analyst Puts MATIC Price At $1.5 Next, the crypto entered into the ‘EW Channel’ which looks like it served as a bounce-off point for the rally. From here, it has been an easy coasting upward reaching above the $34,000 mark. But this is where things start to get interesting. At this level, the analyst predicts a pullback in the price. This pullback from $34,000 sends the price falling back down to as low as $31,000 before the rally starts up again. The end of this retest leads to the top of the third wave where the price reaches as high as $50,000, before another pullback again. This sent the price back down to the $35,000 mark once more to mark the fourth wave before bouncing up again into the fifth wave. Now, at this point, the analyst sees ‘Media Attention’ entering the game (presumably mainstream and traditional finance media), and the lift-off from this level reaches the $70,000 mark. Roadmap to BTC at $70,000 | Source: Tradingview.com Factors To Drive The Momentum The crypto analyst presents seven major factors that are behind the predicted Bitcoin momentum leading into a bull market. For starters, the first is the same as everyone expects – the almighty Bitcoin Halving. This event is undoubtedly the most bullish in Bitcoin’s history and a repeat of it is expected to kickstart the bull market. Next on the list is the Impulse Structure and Rising Channel where the analyst believes that the BTC price is “painting a compelling picture on the daily timeframe.” This leads to the Third Wave Speculation as already explained above. The analyst believes the market is in the third wave, with the fourth being a pullback and the fifth leading above $70,000. Fourth on the list is the Wyckoff Accumulation Pattern in which Bitcoin is already showing strength. Then there is the Bollinger Bands Width Squeeze which has dropped to 2014 levels. “This rarity accentuates Bitcoin’s growth potential, serving as a strong indicator for investors,” ArShevelev says. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Falls 80%, Is It Time To Sell? The sixth factor is the Historical Comparisons where the current price action is compared to previous market trends. The 2023 bear market looks more like the 2015 bear market as the analyst points out, and this could see an almost 100% jump in price as it did in 2015. This would put the Bitcoin price above $50,000. Last but not least is Institutional Interest which has been on the rise lately. Mostly, this has been driven by the enthusiasm around BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, filing for a Spot Bitcoin ETF and possibly bringing Bitcoin into its over $8 trillion portfolio. ArShevelev explains that a Spot Bitcoin ETF “promises to be a game-changer” due to its ability to bridge TradFi to crypto and allow more money to flow into Bitcoin. “The ETF’s advent not only signifies regulatory acknowledgment but also invites a wave of retail participation,” the crypto analyst said. “The anticipation is that as we approach the holiday season, institutional investors will further solidify this upward trajectory.” BTC falls to $34,398 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from The Crypto Basic, chart from Tradingview.com",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-roadmap-to-70000/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42419347,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEGJJ,1698322553,Dollar/Yen Trading Volume Surpasses Bitcoin on DeFi Platform Gains Network,"The U.S. dollar-Japanese yen (USD/JPY) pair has replaced the bitcoin-dollar pair (BTC/USD) as the most traded on the decentralized finance (DeFi) leveraged trading platform Gains Network.  Gains Network, initially released on Polygon and later on Arbitrum, allows users to trade financial derivatives of cryptocurrencies, foreign exchange and commodities by matching buy-sell orders using smart contracts.  The USD/JPY pair has a registered trading volume of $21.64 million in the past 24 hours, nearly 40% greater than BTC/USD’s $15.51 million and highest among all assets, according to data sourced from Dune Analytics. GBP/USD is the third most traded pair, with EUR/JPY taking the fifth spot.  The dollar-yen pair is also the fourth most traded of the past seven and 30 days.  These numbers reveal a growing interest in trading traditional markets over the DeFi rails. That said, the daily turnover in the global foreign exchange market is worth over $7 trillion. Bringing a sizeable chunk of that market on a decentralized platform is easier said than done, considering the scaling issues.  Traders bet millions on yen strength  Early Thursday, some traders took sizeable leveraged short positions in USD/JPY and EUR/JPY pairs on Gains’ Arbitrum-based platform, betting on appreciation in the Japanese yen.  Perhaps these market participants expect the Bank of Japan to intervene in the foreign exchange markets to halt the yen’s slide. The yen bulls have faced nothing but disappointment this year, with USD/JPY rising 14.7% to 150.00. The way USD/JPY options have been priced recently suggests expectations for wild swings in the exchange rate.  ""Someone betting big on @GainsNetwork_io on a Bank of Japan intervention in the JPY fx markets,"" pseudonymous market observer DefiMoon said on X. “The last time [USD/JPY] got above 150 in October 2022; the BoJ stepped up biggly.""  ""These are probably the biggest fx trades on gTrade since the platform launched,” DefiMoon added.  The USD/JPY seller deposited $179.6K in collateral to raise a bearish bet worth $8.26 million.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered’s SC Ventures are testing a system that will allow blockchain-based transactions, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to talk to one another, taking an approach similar to the SWIFT messaging layer in legacy banking infrastructure. The banks are running a series of test cases, including transferring and swapping USDC stablecoins, on the Universal Digital Payments Network (UDPN), a permissioned blockchain system composed of validator nodes run by an alliance of banks, financial institutions and consultancies. The system, created by tech consultancy GFT Group and Red Date Technology, the co-founder of the Chinese Blockchain-Based Service Network (BSN), instructs and allows transactions to occur across a spectrum of networks, ranging from stablecoins on public blockchains to CBDCs.  Sam Bankman-Fried's defense team wants him to testify about his knowledge of whether lawyers were involved in parts of FTX's operation, his understanding of industry practices, his intentions with FTX's funds as his empire collapsed and his knowledge of FTX and Alameda's financials, filings from his attorneys and the Department of Justice (DOJ) suggest. A Wednesday defense filing asked Judge Lewis Kaplan, who's overseeing the case, to grant the defense attorneys permission to ask Bankman-Fried about certain aspects of FTX's operation and how the company's counsel were involved in making those decisions. They include FTX's use of auto-deletion policies for Signal and Slack messages, the opening of North Dimension and its bank accounts, loans made from FTX and Alameda Research to its executives and other issues. The DOJ has tried to argue that some or all of these issues were proof of criminal intent, the filing said. The defense has sought to argue that Bankman-Fried did not intend to defraud his customers or investors and that part of his efforts to run the company depended on advice from his lawyers.  U.S. banking behemoth JPMorgan (JPM) now handles $1 billion worth of transactions in its digital token JPM Coin per day, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. The Wall Street bank has plans to widen the coin's usage, according to the report, citing an interview with the bank’s head of payments, Takis Georgakopoulos. JPM Coin is a settlement token that enables JPMorgan's institutional clients to make blockchain-based wholesale payments between accounts around the world. From its inception in 2019, JPM Coin has been used to make payments denominated in dollars, with support for euros added in June. “JPM Coin gets transacted on a daily basis mostly in U.S. dollars, but we again intend to continue to expand that,” Georgakopoulos said.  Chart of The Day  The chart shows the number of whale addresses and bitcoin's price since January 2014.  The whale addresses count remains near bear market lows, contradicting the resurgent bitcoin price.  ""This metric tends to trend up during bull markets and consolidates as we near bull market peaks. The current lack of increase in this metric indicates that as far as whales are concerned, we are yet to start a new bull cycle,"" IntoTheBlock said.

The Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill covers a range of criminal activities from drug trafficking to cybercrime. Provisions in the bill give broader powers to local cops, and will let them seize crypto with criminal links without a conviction – something experts say would come in handy, particularly in time-sensitive cases.  The bill was introduced last September, and since then amendments have been added to ensure the measures were extended to cover terrorism. Separate provisions to help authorities seize other assets that can help identify crypto linked to crime were also added. It was passed by Parliament on Wednesday.  Although the U.K. has expressed a desire to become a global hub for crypto and has passed some legislation to legitimize crypto in the country, it has also been clamping down on crypto crime and scams. Law enforcement agencies have already seized hundreds of millions of pounds worth of crypto tied to criminal activity and have placed crypto tactical advisers in police departments nationwide to assist in investigations.

HayCoin (HAY), which then dropped back to $3 million, now has just 4.35 tokens in circulating supply spread among 5,800 holders, data from DEXTools show. They currently have a market capitalization of nearly $14 million. Apart from the tokens in circulation, there are no HAY tokens held in any other wallets.  The original tokens were released by Uniswap creator Hayden Adams in 2019, when the exchange was in its very initial stages. While the tokens were never intended to hold any value, and a large part of the supply was destroyed soon afterward, a group of crypto traders stumbled upon some of the surviving ones earlier this month. They were able to acquire those available to the market – and called it HayCoin.  The price jumped earlier this week as Adams burned his holdings. On Thursday morning, a wallet with 51 HAY from 2019 also burned the tokens by sending them to an address that’s not controlled by anyone, with the action likely helping boost prices.  HAY has quickly built a community following that treats the tokens as a digital relic – some even terming it the “original meme coin.”  Being the first of anything can usually end up attracting value among crypto investors, even though there may be no inherent value.  In 2021, some developers were able to relaunch Etheria, a collection of digital land issued just three months after Ethereum was released in 2015.

19402595,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557636,1698318029,Still Not Bullish On Solana? 4 New Reasons Why You Should Be,"Solana (SOL) has been on the tip of many crypto enthusiasts’ tongues lately and with good reason. The vibrant ecosystem, strong partnerships, and a skyrocketing SOL price have given investors plenty to mull over. Here are four (new) reasons why you should lend Solana your attention. #1 Solana And The US Regulatory Landscape Solana’s prospects in the US seem to be intertwined with unfolding regulatory decisions. Vibhu Norby, founder of Drip Labs, today shared notable and positive insights from a recent Crypto Policy Bootcamp, tweeting, “Takeaways from Crypto Policy Bootcamp in D.C. … Most agreed Gensler is an outlier, lots of folks in Congress support crypto and clear rules, and everything is going to be fine. Just slow.” This suggests a broader acceptance and understanding of crypto within the legislative chambers. One of the key points Norby highlighted was the collaborative efforts between the Solana Foundation and Polygon Labs. He shared, “Solana Foundation and Polygon Labs are working together (!) to secure better policy.” Related Reading: Solana Price Surge: Analysts Predict Target Zones Of $69 – $123 In Coming Months Norby also touched upon the ongoing lawsuit between the SEC and Coinbase, asserting, “SEC vs. Coinbase is the most important case right now in the US. A few opinions from smart lawyers think Coinbase probably wins against the SEC before Q2 next year. But nobody knows of course.” The ramifications of this case could have broad implications, especially for tokens like Solana (SOL) that have been pulled into regulatory scrutiny. Given the SEC’s allegations against Binance and Coinbase for selling unregistered securities, including SOL, a favorable outcome for Coinbase might positively impact Solana’s standing in the US and ultimately its price trajectory. #2 Solana’s Potential Blue-Chip Evolution The constant comparison between Ethereum and Solana has given rise to debates in the crypto sphere. However, the increasing attention Solana has garnered, especially from venture capitalists (VCs), has lent credence to the belief that it might soon join the ranks of blue-chip assets. Raj Gokal, co-founder of Solana, recently hinted at a shifting attitude amongst VCs towards Solana. In response, Chris Burniske, analyst and partner at Placeholder VC, predicted a change in perception among VCs – moving from avoidance to eagerness in investing in Solana projects. Burniske further confirmed a user’s query regarding Solana’s potential to attain Ethereum-like prominence, suggesting that in places like India, Solana already enjoys a reputation similar to Ethereum’s. He stated: Very quickly this will go from, ‘We don’t invest in Solana projects,’ to ‘We’re underexposed to Solana.’ And so the bidding wars will begin… the quality entrepreneurs of the ecosystem deserve it.” And would add that in some countries, like India, Solana is already as widely known and beloved as Ethereum. #3 Rising Institutional Interest Recently, the institutional tide appears to be turning in favor of Solana. Sasha Fleyshman, a notable portfolio manager at Arca, expressed his initial hesitation towards Solana in a tweet, stating, “For what it’s worth Raj Gokal, Chris Burniske, I haven’t really seen too much in the pipeline to even consider for investment from the Solana side of the ecosystem.” This sentiment, once widely echoed within the institutional realm, seems to be undergoing a change. “I think party lines were drawn on both sides [Ethereum and Solana]- as for us, we are open to taking looks, but unsure how to get that started,” Fleyshman revealed. Related Reading: Solana Epic Bounceback To Pre-FTX Heights: Brace Yourself For What’s Next A deep dive into recent data also shows Solana’s growing allure among institutional investors. Solana (SOL) has seen the strongest influx of capital among all crypto assets in recent weeks. Per CoinShares’ weekly digital asset investment products report, SOL has been the darling of institutional investors. The latest CoinShares report indicated a significant surge in capital inflows towards Solana. In just one week, Solana attracted a substantial $15.5 million, starkly juxtaposed against Ethereum’s outflows, which stood at $7.4 million for the same period. Such a bullish institutional endorsement is further amplified when considering the year-long metrics. Solana’s Assets under Management (AuM) for the year have burgeoned to a remarkable $74 million, marking a surge of 47%. In comparison, Ethereum’s outflows have amounted to $119 million year-to-date. #4 Bullish Chart Setup The Solana (SOL) chart is extremely bullish and one of the strongest in the entire altcoin market right now, with a performance of +240% year-to-date. At press time, SOL was trading at $32.14 after establishing a new high for the year yesterday at $33.87 yesterday. The SOL price has broken out of the triangle formation and is in the process of establishing a new trading range above $30.61. If SOL defends this level in the coming days and weeks, a rise to the next key resistance area at $47.21 could be on the cards.

42419325,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEG0j,1698314400,Sam Bankman-Fried Testifies: What Will He Reveal Under Oath About FTX's Collapse?,"You’ve already heard the news. Sam Bankman-Fried is going to testify in his own criminal trial. Probably later today.  But what’s he going to say?  I really have no idea. No, seriously, I don’t.  He’s said so much (or is it so little?) already. In the month between FTX’s collapse and his arrest in the Bahamas, Sam spun a story for the cameras of the world. In his telling, the crypto exchange’s early November meltdown wasn’t because it had illegally loaned a bajillion dollars of customer deposits to his hedge fund, Alameda. Or maybe it was. But if it was, he sorta didn’t know about it.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly?Sign up here.  Here’s generally what he said: In 2022 the crypto market imploded. Alameda took a hit. It definitely had some FTX customer money (a bunch of which it was allowed to have) and then a whole bunch of money definitely went poof. Who’s to say who knew what? Not him. Not really.  “I was vaguely aware,” Sam Bankman-Fried said during his halting Dec. 1, 2022 interview with George Stephanopoulos, portions of which have been played during the trial. Few familiar with the crypto industry believed him. I doubt anyone else did, either.  Nevertheless, two factors were going for Sam at the time: 1. He was operating in a low-information environment, and 2. He wasn’t under oath. Both factors are now invalidated and reversed: they work against him as he takes the stand. Let’s start with the first.  When Sam gave that broadcast interview – his best, first chance to tell his tale to as many normal people as possible – he assumed a unique position of authority as to FTX and its downfall. Sure, there were press reports that hinted at nefarious deals, like Caroline’s alleged tell-all to employees of Alameda, but those were all hearsay. Against that: Sam’s heady opportunity to be a first-person narrator. Caroline wasn’t saying her side directly to the public. HE could, so he did.  LIVE: Sam Bankman-Fried Will Testify Soon Today in the FTX Fraud Trial  The story he gave to GMA was not convincing. His long pauses bled into hardly artful dodges of difficult questions. Sam admitted he felt absolutely terrible that “a lot of people got hurt” by the company’s implosion and he wished he took “like, a lot more responsibility for understanding what the details were, what was going on” at Alameda, rather than leave it to others, like, uhhh, the lawyers.  What Sam could not provide in answers he tried to make up for with solutions. Weeks after resigning from the bankrupt FTX he told GMA’s audience that he was “trying to focus on what I could do going forward to be helpful” for his failed company. (For what it’s worth, FTX’s new CEO “Enron John” Ray III wanted nothing to do with Sam and ignored his emails and texts).  Stephanopoulos pushed and pushed Sam on whether he knew about Alameda robbing FTX’s piggy bank, as the press alleged Caroline had said he did. Refusing to take Sam’s dodging, the interviewer conjured up a prescient scenario. I’ll transcribe it here.  Stephanopoulos: If she’s in court and you’re in court and she’s under oath, and you’re under oath (Sam: “yep”), and you’re asked, did you know that these funds were being funneled to Alameda, what is your answer?”  Sam pauses for 8 seconds  Sam: “I did not know that there was any improper, uhh, use of customer funds.”  Over the last three weeks at trial we’ve heard Caroline and a whole bunch of other FTX insiders testify (under oath) that Sam knew about the secret loan arrangement. Not only that he knew, but that he ordered code to be written that allowed it to happen. Not only that he orchestrated it, but that he hid it from his lawyers. That he ignored their pleas to shut off the customer fund valve. That he spent their money on his business, on other businesses, on loan payments, on sponsorships, on apartments and island houses.  In the spirit of Stephanopoulos’ question we’ll focus on what Caroline said under oath on Oct. 11.  Caroline: “He [Sam] was the one who set up the systems that allowed Alameda to take the money, and he was the one who directed us to take customer money to repay our loans.”  So, what’s Sam gonna say under oath? I really have no idea.  — Danny Nelson  What we're expecting in court today  Here's the game plan for today:  The Department of Justice has one last witness, FBI Agent Mark Troiano. He'll testify that Bankman-Fried was in about 200 different group chats which had auto-delete enabled. The DOJ thinks direct examination will take maybe 30 minutes, and the defense thinks 10 minutes max.  Once that's done, a little past 10:00 a.m. ET, the defense starts its turn, and plans to call Krystal Rolle, a Bahamas attorney who represented Bankman-Fried and was present at a meeting with the country’s securities regulator that former FTX executive Gary Wang testified about. There's a little bit of controversy here, as the DOJ says it only just heard about Rolle, and the judge has ordered the defense to provide more information.  Defense attorney Mark Cohen thinks Rolle will take maybe 30 minutes on direct examination. Joseph Pimbley, the proposed expert witness, will take maybe 20 minutes max on direct examination and possibly around the same again for cross-examination.  The defense has a third witness who’d point out there were over a dozen lawyers in the various group chats Bankman-Fried was part of, though Cohen said he's hoping for a stipulation with the DOJ to make that testimony unnecessary. The DOJ’s Nicholas Roos (whose name is pronounced ""rose,"" by the way) doesn't think the information is even admissible.  For those of you doing the math, all these witnesses may be done by 11:30 or 12. And that brings us to the man of the hour, Sam Bankman-Fried himself. As Danny noted above, he's said quite a lot about what he thinks happened with FTX, and the defense clearly wants to continue pushing its position that he didn't intend to defraud customers or investors and things just kind of spiraled.  For the first time in a while, Bankman-Fried will have an opportunity to do just that.  — Nikhilesh De",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,"Danny Nelson, Nikhilesh De",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/26/whats-left-for-sam-to-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84d3ca7ee2a1134decf42c38bcf6e637ea645d1f-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This optimism is reflected in bitcoin’s strong outperformance versus other digital assets, the report said, noting that the world’s largest cryptocurrency recently made a new high for the year.  “It looks like this latest flow impulse had institutional participation,” analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  The bank’s analysis of the crypto futures market supports this assertion.  “Our futures position proxy based on CME bitcoin futures, which tends to be used mostly by institutional investors, has spiked over the past week rising not only to the highest level for this year but also to levels last seen in August 2022 before the FTX collapse,” the analysts wrote, referring to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  JPMorgan says the equivalent futures position proxy for CME ether [ETH] futures remains subdued.  Institutional participation in the recent rally is also reflected in analysis of bitcoin flows, the note said. There has been a large BTC inflow into larger wallets, which points to institutional investor demand.  This contrasts with previous quarters “when the bitcoin impulse was led by smaller wallets thus more driven by retail investors,” the report said.

However, there are other developments that the XRP community might need to be aware of, as they could cause the crypto token to continue to rally. Ripple To See More Liquidity With Latest Collaboration Blockchain company Ripple recently announced that it had partnered with Web3 financial platform Uphold. As part of the partnership agreement, Uphold is expected to provide Ripple with “enhanced crypto liquidity capabilities” to help facilitate transactions on its cross-border payments infrastructure more efficiently. Related Reading: A Chance At Redemption: Analyst Puts MATIC Price At $1.5 The news is significant for the XRP community because Ripple uses XRP as a utility token to help process these cross-border transactions. As such, “enhanced crypto liquidity” will generally translate to more liquidity in the XRP ecosystem, which could ultimately cause a further surge in the token’s price. Xumm Wallet Records Milestone XRP-based wallet Xumm announced in a post on its X (formerly Twitter) platform that it had crossed 600,000 active users in the past three months. The wallet happens to be one of the notable ones on the XRP Ledger, as it also announced plans to introduce new functionalities that could see the number of its active users increase exponentially. In the post, Xumm mentioned that its wallet is set to become 10x more retail-friendly with the redesign they are working on. It also plans to integrate AMM and more DEX activity, which would see the wallet become 10x better. It is believed that the wallet plans to complete this integration once the AMM goes live on the XRP Ledger. Meanwhile, the wallet’s use cases will also increase as Xumm plans to incorporate XRP’s sidechain Xahua and its ‘Hooks’ feature. These developments are bullish for XRP as they will undoubtedly increase the token’s utility. NFTs Are Coming To XRP Ledger Ripple had reportedly been working on tools and services to accommodate tokenized assets and facilitate trading of these assets on the XRP Ledger. The company’s efforts seem to be already paying dividends, as SBI Holdings announced plans to issue its NFT service “EXPO2025 Digital Wallet NFT,” also known as ‘Myakoon’ on the XRP Ledger. Related Reading: Massive Ethereum Whale Transfer Threatens To End ETH Rally, Here’s Why It is believed that this development could open the door for other NFT issuers to launch their NFTs on the network. This is also more significant because of how the tokenized market is projected to grow massively to $13.6 billion by 2027. As such, XRP has the potential to be at the heart of the market when this happens.

42419342,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEGGD,1698312514,Bitcoin to Score 'Golden Cross' After 30% Price Surge in 2 Weeks,"Bitcoin [BTC], the largest cryptocurrency, is on track to complete its first golden cross since early February, a sign of strengthening bullish momentum in which the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) overtakes the 200-day SMA on an upward trajectory.  At press time, the 50-day SMA was $27,714 and rising, while the 200-day SMA was $28,174, according to charting platform TradingView. Bitcoin has rallied 30% in two weeks, tapping levels above $35,000, last seen in May 2022, CoinDesk data show.  A golden cross indicates that short-term price momentum is outperforming the long-term, potentially evolving into a bull run. The opposite of the golden cross is the death cross, in which the 50-day SMA drops below the 20-day equivalent.  While these indicators are widely-tracked by trend-following traders, they are based on backward-looking studies, and have a mixed record as standalone indicators of bullish and bearish trends. BTC has seen nine golden crossovers to date, of which three, dated July 11, 2014, July 15, 2015 and Feb. 19, 2020, were invalidated within three months by death crosses and notable downtrends.  The rest were followed by uptrends of varying degrees, as seen below.  A trader holding a long position for a year following the occurrence of the first two golden crosses and the one in May 2020 would have made triple-digit percentage returns.  Bitcoin rallied to a record high of $69,000 in the weeks following the September, 2021, golden cross, only to almost entirely erase its gains by the end of the three months. Bitcoin later fell into a death cross.  The impending golden cross may live up to its reputation, given the optimism about a potential launch of a U.S.-based spot ETF, macroeconomic uncertainty and bitcoin's growing appeal as a haven asset and next year's mining reward halving.  ""Halvings are viewed as having a bullish effect on the price of BTC by reducing the selling pressure emanating from miners but also reducing the pace at which BTC’s supply is diluted,"" Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial said in an email on Wednesday.  Bitcoin's fourth reward halving, a programmed code to reduce the pace of BTC's supply expansion by 50% every four years, is due in April 2024.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/26/bitcoin-to-score-golden-cross-after-30-price-surge-in-two-weeks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/096443e220527fab84e84cc9c7c6490ced45faf4-3888x2187.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
19399249,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4643671-hut-8-mining-an-opportunity-emerges?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1698312331,Hut 8 Mining: An Opportunity Emerges,"Summary Bitcoin miners like Hut 8 mining have experienced a rough period of volatility, but there may be an opportunity in the upward direction. Interest in Bitcoin is increasing, with heavy trading volumes indicating potential interest from institutional investors. Also, there could be the potential approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF by the SEC that could boost the value of Bitcoin. However, when you have such news and the market acting on these, investors must be aware of the risks. Still, I rate Hut 8 as Buy due to its large self-mined reserves of Bitcoin and also the action it is taking to reduce revenue shortfalls related to the Halving event. Bitcoin miners like Hut 8 Mining Corp. (HUT) have been through a rough time since July despite producing a mind-blowing 180% YTD performance, but, based on the latest market action including trading volumes, the aim of this thesis is to show that we could be on the cusp of an opportunity, in the upward direction. Thus, as shown in the chart below, the miner broke through its support level of $2 during the last five days, and Seeking Alpha's Quant also upgraded its ratings to Buy from Hold on October 19. Data by YCharts However, since investing in Bitcoin implies a lot of volatility-related risks, I first start by going through some of the market actions that have resulted in the current risk-off environment. The objective is also to learn from these in order to confirm the bullish thesis. Explaining the Volatility Episode Going back to the August volatility episode, this occurred after crypto-assets were buoyed in June because of the interest shown by financial giants, including asset manager BlackRock ( BLK ) and the big investment banks like JPMorgan ( JPM ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS ) as I detailed in a previous thesis on the ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITI ) on July 5. At that time, I was Bullish on Bitcoin on the basis of institutional interest and since that time Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has been up by around 16% . However, between now and then, the cryptocurrency has treaded a highly fluctuating path. Thus, during the second week of August, the value of the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value fell from around $29,910/BTC to $25,400/BTC according to the chart below, and this occurred within a week. Noteworthily, at certain periods it fell by more than 12% in a matter of hours including episodes where the digital asset recorded its largest single-day decline since November 2022, when Sam Bankman-Fried's major cryptocurrency exchange platform FTX collapsed. In its fall, Bitcoin dragged down the entire crypto market, including ether which lost nearly 10% in one week. Bitcoin's performance (www.seekingalpha.com) Noteworthily, the chart above also shows the volumes which were traded. This shows that while the upside in June had seen relatively few numbers of transactions (or buys and sells) averaging around 40K, the situation is completely different currently as there is heavy volume which is currently above 700K. This is seventeen times higher than in June and could indicate interest by institutional investors. The Opportunity This thought process is confirmed by analysts from Bernstein with the investment firm saying that institutions were "" entering the cycle pre-hype"" for the first time. Now, by ""hype"", it means the enthusiasm instilled among investors when a Bitcoin ETF, more precisely a Bitcoin Spot ETF looks likely to be approved by the SEC (Security and Exchange Commission). In this case, investors will note that a fund like the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) trades futures. In contrast, a Spot ETF, if approved, will track the value of the Bitcoin asset in real-time instead of indirectly betting on the market's position on the cryptocurrency, as is the case with a futures ETF. This bodes well for the value of the cryptocurrency. Digging deeper, according to Bernstein, such approval could happen by January 2024 or even sooner based on the Grayscale vs SEC court case. Now, some of you may remember that in August , Grayscale, a major cryptocurrency asset manager, won a court appeal against the SEC, which denied it the right to list its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust fund ( GBTC ) on the NYSE trading platform by giving it an ETF status. This legal victory opens the door to the creation of a Bitcoin Spot ETF that would allow a larger part of the general public to invest in this asset class without having to purchase it directly, which would in turn boost the whole ecosystem. Higher Bitcoin Prices Boosting Hut 8's Treasury Now the value of Hut 8's treasury directly depends on the value of Bitcoin and it possesses a large self-mined reserve when compared to other publicly traded miners with 9,366 BTC as I detail later. Based on a unit price of $34,678/BTC, this comes to a fair market value of over $300 million. By comparison, the company had $48.4 million of debt on its balance sheet together with $20.1 million of cash at the end of the second quarter of 2023 which means that by disposing of its crypto assets, the miner can become net cash-positive. In this respect, the miner consumes money instead of generating cash from operations, but, from - 21.3 million in the second quarter of 2022 to -1.0 million in the latest quarter, there has been an improvement. Still, to ensure that it does not run out of cash, the company has entered into a $50 million credit facility. Pursuing further, for September 2023, 111 Bitcoin were mined which represents an increase from the 103 generated in August thanks to the production capacity of its high-performance computing infrastructure. This capacity was raised to 42.7 BTC/EH in September following the addition of about 2.6 EH/s or exahashes per second of additional ASIC hashrate (production capacity) at its Alberta facilities in Canada. Going into details, according to CoinDesk, EH/s stands for exahashes per second and measures the computational power dedicated to mining operations. By comparison, Riot Platforms (RIOT), a U.S-based miner produced more, or 362 Bitcoins in September, which represents an increase of 29 in August. However, despite producing more, its treasury boasted 7,327 BTC at the end of last month which is less than Hut 8's 9,366 BTC. This is explained by the Canadian miner currently privileging a HODLing strategy or holding on to the Bitcoins produced instead of selling them as is the case with Riot which disposed of 340 BTC for net proceeds of $9.0 million. This strategy to hoard Bitcoins also makes sense given that Halving Bitcoin, the long-awaited block reduction event estimated to occur around April 1, 2024, will involve splitting the reward obtained from mining new blockchain blocks in half, meaning miners will receive 50% fewer Bitcoins for the same amount of effort put in. Another of Hut 8's strategies to counter the effects of Halving is its proposed business combination with US Data Mining Group, which was approved by both shareholders and the Supreme Court of British Columbia in September. Therefore, in light of the Halving event that will increase the mining difficulty for the whole industry, Hut 8's strategy of both holding on to its produce and merging the business to gain from a larger scale are two positives, to be considered when valuing the company. Valuations of Key Takeaways As pictured below, the valuation grade of A+ means that Hut 8 is undervalued. Using the forward GAAP P/E multiple of 9.91x which is discounted relative to IT peers by 59%, I have a target of around $3 (2.34 x 1.3) based on a 30% adjustment of the current share price of $2.34. Valuation Metrics (seekingalpha.com) My bullishness is further justified due to the fact that holding on to the miner's shares constitutes an alternative to buying Bitcoins or owning them through the ETF route. In this respect, its treasury is an important factor to consider and is one of the reasons that it has outperformed the cryptocurrency itself as charted below. Still, with higher rewards also come more risks and the chart also shows that miners carry higher volatility risks. Comparison of performances (seekingalpha.com) This is in line with the risk-awareness tone that has been prevalent throughout this publication, and it is important to note that Bitcoin remains a volatile asset class and, as such is prone to risks of capital destruction. This means that it may not be the right investment for those who are more value-oriented and do not have the stomach for risks. Also, given crypto's correlation to the technology sector, any volatility grappling tech during this earnings season could be contagious to Bitcoin. Thus, it is important to have a risk appetite to invest and some may wait for a retrenchment before investing as momentum indicators do not indicate the upside to be a smooth one, as the RSI is above 60 which indicates an overbought condition. Finally, in addition to potential institutional interest, some, including a U.S. attorney have perceived a potentially softer stance by the SEC towards the crypto asset, as its Chair Gary Gensler, who is normally very vocal, did not take the opportunity to criticize the industry after fake news about the approval of BlackRock's Spot ETF application.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4643671-hut-8-mining-an-opportunity-emerges?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/19399249.jpeg

The system, created by tech consultancy GFT Group and Red Date Technology, co-founder of the Chinese Blockchain-Based Service Network (BSN), instructs and allows transactions to occur across a spectrum of networks, ranging from stablecoins on public blockchains to CBDCs.  There’s a relatively long history in crypto of banks and institutions banding together into consortia to try and agree on the best way to manage blockchain-based transactions in private settings. After some hype, these enterprise blockchains have garnered limited interest thus far.  Digital currencies provide both medium and message, questioning the need to run something like SWIFT messages in parallel. The answer, its creators say, is that UDPN acts both as an interoperability bridge between various types of blockchain networks while also applying battle-tested decentralized digital identity standards (DIDs) to participants, allowing for a bank-friendly and regulated environment.  “The UDPN is a network where the affiliation of members is permissioned. But the key thing here is that the transactions themselves are placed onto the underlying infrastructure, which includes permissionless networks,” Thorsten Neumann, CTO of SC Ventures, said in an interview.  For instance, when carrying out a cross-border currency transfer, the sending institution takes the tokenized value and transfers it into a smart contract managed by the UDPN, which will then release the intended target currency from that smart contract, Neumann said.  “There is almost a DeFi-type capability within a permissioned network. It’s important to note this is done without a central organization setting out something like a SWIFT message format,” he said.  The UDPN currently comprises about 25 organizations running around 10 proof-of-concept tests in parallel, according to Steffen Schacher, UDPN lead at GFT Group. That group includes banks from the USA, Australia, Latin America and Europe, he said.  The UDPN’s transaction nodes are where the magic happens, being connected to currency systems and currency pools,” Schacher said in an interview. “The way to envision it is each currency needs a transaction of its own, so to speak. This could be central banks in the future, owning transactions and operating CBDCs, or other financial institutions, or any other organization that is handling digital currencies, bringing it all into a regulated environment.”  CORRECTION (Oct. 27, 08:40 UTC): Removes ""Ventures"" from headline because there is no unit called Standard Chartered Ventures.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/10/26/deutsche-bank-and-standard-chartered-ventures-test-swift-killer-for-stablecoins-and-cbdcs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7b6ccf9b2c1a20b7771804d88350923ef5f0f611-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This week, XRP investors and enthusiasts have ample reasons to celebrate as the coin saw an impressive surge of 14.2% in its price over the past seven days, bringing it to a notable high after its last dip in August. This remarkable surge highlights the cryptocurrency’s ability to experience significant price movements within a relatively short timeframe. The upward trajectory of XRP’s price over the past week suggests an increase in investor interest or positive market sentiment, which has driven its value to levels higher than what was observed just seven days ago. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.559841, with a modest 0.2% loss over the past 24 hours. One of the most significant indicators of XRP’s current performance is the overwhelming interest from buyers rather than sellers. The Volume Delta metric cited in a price analysis in highlights this trend vividly. Volume Delta essentially measures the difference between buying and selling pressure in the market, serving as a valuable gauge for traders seeking to make informed decisions. In the case of XRP, this metric is painting a positive picture as buying sentiment dominates, giving traders the confidence to enter long positions. This surge in buying interest suggests that investors have renewed faith in the coin’s potential, as the coin has rebounded from the lows witnessed in the past. With growing adoption and an increasing number of use cases for XRP, it’s no surprise that the cryptocurrency is attracting a substantial inflow of funds.

In the last 24 hours, an anonymous wallet executed a substantial transfer of 26,800,000 XRP to the major EU-based exchange, Bitstamp.

Data provided by the XRP explorer, Bithomp, has shed some light on the sender’s identity, revealing a connection to Ripple Labs, a blockchain decacorn known for its involvement in the development and promotion of the token’s ecosystem. This significant transfer underscores the confidence in its future, as well as the growing influence of Ripple Labs within the cryptocurrency space.

19395430,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557609,1698305103,Dogecoin Price Poised For Epic Surge To $1.5: Crypto Analyst,"In a recent analysis shared by renowned crypto analyst, Jaydee, Dogecoin (DOGE) appears to be setting the stage for a potentially significant price rally. The chart showcases a series of technical indicators and patterns that hint towards a bullish trajectory for the meme coin, with a projected price target above $1.5. In a tweet accompanying the chart, Jaydee remarked: “Dogecoin – meme (shitcoin) with a beautiful chart structure! Will DOGE have that confirmed breakout?! Last time it broke out from a multi-year triangle, it 380x in price! Similar structure compared to the 2020-2021 breakout!” Dogecoin Price Prints Historic Buy Signal The chart provided by Jaydee displays the DOGE/USD trading pair with a bi-weekly time frame. Dogecoin’s price history, as highlighted in the chart, reveals two significant breakout points. The first breakout took place in 2017, where the price surged from below $0.003 in March 2017 to a peak of $0.0193 in January 2018. The second notable breakout occurred around the end of 2020 till April 2021, skyrocketing the DOGE price from about $0.035 to an all-time high close to $0.76. Related Reading: Dogecoin Aggressive 12% Leap: Fear/Greed Index Uncovers Bullish Sentiment Secrets Over the past few two years, from April 2021 till recently, Dogecoin’s price has been forming a symmetrical triangle pattern again. This is a classic continuation pattern, and given DOGE’s past bullish momentum, a breakout from this triangle to the upside seems plausible. Remarkably, DOGE’s 380x price rise was also preceded by a multi-year triangular formation. At the end of 2020, DOGE broke out of the formation, but first experienced a successful retest of the trendline and a short sideways phase of around three months before the massive rally. Jaydee’s analysis indicates that the DOGE price has begun its breakout from this symmetrical triangle with this week’s candle, hinting at a continuation of its previous bullish trend. If history repeats itself, DOGE could first experience another minor pullback, followed by a short sideways phase, before the ascent towards the current all-time high begins. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Prediction – DOGE Could Soon Pump 20% Like Bitcoin By extrapolating from past performance and the present chart structure, Jaydee’s analysis proposes that a confirmed breakout could see DOGE aiming for the $1.5 price range sometime in 2024, as detailed with the blue arrow in the chart. The chart humorously remarks that “BEGINNERS will be buying up here.. SMH! LOL!”, suggesting that novice traders might be lured into buying at the peak. While it’s a lighthearted note, it’s also a cautionary tale for traders to conduct their due diligence and not follow the herd mentality. While the 2-week chart in Jaydee’s analysis has already posted a bullish breakout signal, the 1-day chart still looks somewhat different. The price is still below the trendline (black), at which Dogecoin has been rejected several times since December last year. However, DOGE has crossed the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.0692 and is now approaching the trendline again.

42419328,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEG4r,1698302549,"Dogecoin, Shiba Inu Jump 9% as Crypto Traders Take Riskier Bets","Popular meme tokens dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) jumped some 9% in the past 24 hours, which suggests crypto traders are taking riskier bets on the back of bitcoin’s (BTC) outperformance.  Although there were no immediate catalysts for SHIB and DOGE tokens, the prices jumped on Thursday after social media platform X, formerly Twitter, revealed a video calling feature for premium users. This was likely a sign of irrational exuberance – as some traders have historically expected X to add DOGE as a payment option.  X CEO Elon Musk has often touted dogecoin as one of his favorite cryptocurrencies, even going as far as dedicating a segment to the meme coin during his appearance on the popular TV show “Saturday Night Live” in 2021. Twitter also briefly changed its logo to the dogecoin logo in April to spur a rally that gained as much as 37% for some traders.  Cumulative trading volumes for the tokens jumped to $1.2 billion on Thursday from $350 million on Monday, data shows.  Elsewhere, open interest in DOGE and SHIB futures spiked over 50% – indicating larger bets placed by traders who expect more volatility in the coming days.  Hopes of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) helped bump bitcoin prices some 30% over the past week before retreating, with ether (ETH), solana (SOL) and xrp (XRP) adding as much as 40%.  DOGE and SHIB added just 15% in the same period. However, the tokens underperformed other majors despite being generally more volatile.  Meanwhile, a run-up in both these tokens has historically marked a local top for bitcoin and other major tokens. “Every time that [the] price of DOGE starts rising rapidly, there’s a market-wide crash following just moments later,” blockchain analytics firm Santiment said in a report last December.

42419343,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEGD7,1698299903,Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Outshines Nvidia With 220% Gain This Year,"Contrarian investors who snapped up shares in Grayscale Investment's bitcoin trust (GBTC) in early January, a time of gloom and doom in the crypto and crypto-adjacent markets, have been rewarded handsomely.  GBTC shares have surged 220% to $26.79 this year, according to charting platform TradingView. Meanwhile, Nvidia Corp (NVDA), the best-performing S&P 500 stock, has risen 198%, with the index registering a 9% gain. Bitcoin (BTC) has doubled this year to $35,000 while traditional fixed-income instruments like government bonds have crashed.  Grayscale and CoinDesk are part of the Digital Currency Group.  GBTC's outperformance comes amid hopes the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would greenlight the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an open-ended exchange-traded fund (ETF) that invests in bitcoin.  The optimism has seen the discount in the GBTC shares relative to the trust's net-asset value (NAV) narrow to 13% from 46% this year, with traders buying GBTC shares while hedging downside risk by simultaneously selling bitcoin in the spot/futures market. As soon as the conversion is approved, market makers will return the price to the NAV.  ""GBTC is the gift that keeps giving. Congratulations to those (many on this list) who nailed the narrowing of the spread playing against the futures,"" Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, said in an email last week.  The bi-legged strategy aimed at profiting from the narrowing of the GBTC discount may have capped gains in bitcoin early this year.  With the discount fast narrowing amid increased prospects of SEC approving the conversion to an ETF, traders may unwind the strategy, including the short BTC futures leg, bolstering bullish pressures around the cryptocurrency.  ""As the GBTC ETF conversion approval seems increasingly likely, investors know that market makers will bring the price back to NAV as soon as it starts trading. As this investment instrument normalizes back to NAV value for investors, it seems likely that short BTC pressure will subside and support upward pressure on BTC spot price,"" Alexander S. Blume, managing partner at Two Prime Digital Assets, told CoinDesk.  Bitcoin has risen 28% in less than two weeks, hitting 17-month highs above $35,000 mainly on the back of spot-ETF rumors, including the one about the supposed listing of BlackRock’s spot bitcoin ETF ticker, IBTC, on clearing house DTCC's website.  Expectations are for the SEC to approve several spot-based ETFs early next year. While the consensus is for bitcoin to surge to $50,000 and higher following the approval of ETFs, the financialization could also bring additional selling pressure to the market.  ""ETFs will also allow more institutional participants to short this instrument.

42392200,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg2sg9,1698293885,"Sam Bankman-Fried May Testify to Role of Lawyers, 'Good Faith' Efforts, Filing Says","Sam Bankman-Fried's defense team wants him to testify about his knowledge of whether lawyers were involved in parts of FTX's operation, his understanding of industry practices, his intentions with FTX's funds as his empire collapsed and his knowledge of FTX and Alameda's financials, filings from his attorneys and the Department of Justice (DOJ) suggest.  A Wednesday defense filing asked Judge Lewis Kaplan, who's overseeing the case, to grant the defense attorneys permission to ask Bankman-Fried about certain aspects of FTX's operation and how the company's counsel were involved in making those decisions. They include FTX's use of auto-deletion policies for Signal and Slack messages, the opening of North Dimension and its bank accounts, loans made from FTX and Alameda Research to its executives and other issues. The DOJ has tried to argue that some or all of these issues were proof of criminal intent, the filing said.  The defense has sought to argue that Bankman-Fried did not intend to defraud his customers or investors and that part of his efforts to run the company depended on advice from his lawyers. While the judge blocked many of these ""advice of counsel"" arguments, he allowed the defense team to raise a limited version with permission – namely, the permission attorney Mark Cohen is seeking in Wednesday's filing.  Cohen also wrote that he wants to ask Bankman-Fried about his ""good faith intentions"" in trying to move FTX assets to the Securities Commission of the Bahamas the day after the company filed for bankruptcy to argue that the FTX founder did not think the company's lawyers had customers' best interests in mind.  ""At a minimum, Mr. Bankman-Fried should be permitted testify in his defense regarding the involvement of counsel on these topics to counter any implication from the testimony elicited to date that he failed to act in good faith with respect to these matters,"" Cohen wrote.  A DOJ filing also suggested that the defense wants to use charts detailing Alameda's assets, debts and net asset values when Bankman-Fried (or possibly another witness, but heavily suggesting it's Bankman-Fried) testifies. Prosecutors oppose using these charts because they do not ""identify the sources on which they are based.""  The defense team has not explained the data sources for the charts for ""weeks,"" the DOJ filing said.  Pushback from the DOJ  The DOJ filing also pushed back on the defense's intent to list the titles of the 13 or so different attorneys who were present in some or all of the group chats that Bankman-Fried was part of.  ""There is no relevant purpose to such evidence, and its introduction unnecessarily and in a misleading manner focuses the jury on the presence of attorneys that have no relevance to the case, running afoul of the Court’s pretrial ruling on this issue,"" the DOJ filing said.  One of the defense's proposed witnesses could also speak to this issue, though Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Roos told the court during a Wednesday teleconference that prosecutors ""think the evidence itself is inadmissible,"" the argument echoed in the filing from later in the day.  The defense wants to call Bahamas attorney Krystal Rolle to testify to Bankman-Fried's conversations with the Bahamas securities regulator – seemingly tied to Cohen's argument that Bankman-Fried was making a good faith effort – but prosecutors' Wednesday filing said it did not have any of the proper paperwork to prepare for cross-examination, asking the judge to order the defense to produce it (which he did). Should these materials not be made available, Rolle's testimony should be blocked, the DOJ filing said.  Special verdict  The DOJ filing and a separate defense filing also addressed Judge Kaplan's request for thoughts on a ""special verdict form"" for one of the DOJ's charges – wire fraud on FTX customers.  Cohen said the defense opposed using a special verdict, where the judge would create a form with specific questions that the jury must answer, rather than have the jury decide on their own whether the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Kaplan asked whether a special verdict made sense during Wednesday's teleconference, giving the parties time to look into the issue. The motions of a special verdict may prejudice the jury, Cohen said.  In the DOJ filing, prosecutors said they would be willing to modify their proposed jury instructions to clear up language and eliminate the need for a special verdict form.

19388699,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557580,1698292842,Solana Price Surge: Analysts Predict Target Zones Of $69 – $123 In Coming Months,"Solana price (SOL) has recently showcased an impressive performance, setting new records as it regains its bullish momentum. After experiencing a significant decline since July 14, SOL has emerged as one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies, trailing only behind Pepecoin (PEPE) and Chainlink (LINK) in terms of gains in the past 24 hours. With sustained upward movement, SOL has surged by 8.9% in the past day, 39% in the past week, a remarkable 51% in the last two weeks, and 68% in just 30 days. Solana Price Potential Unveiled The recent surge in Solana price has caught the attention of crypto enthusiasts and analysts alike. The 8.9% increase in the past 24 hours has propelled SOL to outperform most other cryptocurrencies in the top 100 list. On this matter, renowned crypto analyst “Titan of Crypto” has shed light on the anticipated target zones for Solana in the months ahead. According to the Titan of Crypto’s in-depth analysis, SOL has the potential to achieve a price range between $69 and $123. These projections reflect the optimistic outlook surrounding Solana’s future performance and market prospects. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Will Send BTC Back To $44,000, Why This Trading Firm Is Betting On This Scenario However, despite recently attaining a new yearly high for 2023 and surpassing its monthly resistance level, Solana’s price faces several obstacles that could impact the realization of these projections in the upcoming months. It is important to note that Solana’s price has reached levels not witnessed since the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange back in November 2022. These factors contribute to the existing resistance that Solana needs to overcome for the anticipated scenario to materialize. SOL’s Next Resistance Level Presents 9% Upside Potential What is particularly encouraging for Solana bulls is the potential for further growth in the near term, despite the upcoming challenges that may lie ahead for the cryptocurrency’s price. Currently, the next significant resistance level stands at $36.86. If the current bullish momentum continues, there is a possibility for another leg-up of approximately 9% once this resistance is breached. Related Reading: Will Ethereum Rally Continue? These Could Be The Factors To Watch Should Solana successfully surpass this hurdle, the subsequent obstacles for SOL are positioned at $37, $39, $43, and $46 in the months to come. However, for the token to solidify the breakout of its monthly resistance and sustain the upward trend, it is crucial to achieve a monthly close above the $32 mark. This emphasis on a monthly close above $32 serves as a key metric to confirm the bullish momentum and support the ongoing upward trajectory of Solana. Market participants will be closely monitoring these developments to assess the token’s ability to maintain its positive momentum and overcome potential challenges in the future. According to CoinGecko data, the current Solana price stands at $33.00. The trading volume for the past 24 hours amounts to $1,668,696,328.50. With a total supply of 420 million SOL tokens, Solana’s market capitalization is valued at $13,631,609,298.

The upcoming Bitcoin halving is expected to reduce the rate at which the supply of Bitcoin will enter the market. Lastly the potential for spot Bitcoin ""ETFs"" to drive further demand, in fact, Galaxy estimates that one ETF could gain $14 billion in inflows during the first year. If these catalysts are realized together, they will create an imbalance in supply and demand, which could cause further price increases. However, how these catalysts affect the Bitcoin price is. Introduction In this article, I'm going to provide an update on the catalysts that are driving the tremendous upward momentum in the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) price. However, each of these comes with risks that could cause Bitcoin price to reverse its momentum going forward. Catalysts The increasing utility of Bitcoin The upcoming Bitcoin halving Spot Bitcoin ETFs The synergies of the three catalysts above I believe that these catalysts have contributed to the increasing price of Bitcoin. Furthermore, since Bitcoin's price is dependent on supply and demand dynamics, it is possible to argue that the upcoming Bitcoin halving will reduce the upcoming Bitcoin supply, the spot ETFs and increased utility will increase the demand for Bitcoin, and hence the price of Bitcoin should go up. 1. The Increasing Utility of Bitcoin Potential Bitcoin is up 13.5% since I recommended it as a buy on June 27th. I recommended it on the basis of the digital assets utility for being a payment layer through the lightning network. In my article , ""Can Bitcoin Lightning Solve The Remittance Industry?"", I discussed how Bitcoin has the potential to be used as a payment rail for international transactions. Block Inc's ( SQ ) CEO, Jack Dorsey, has suggested Bitcoin as ""the native currency of the internet"" as well as a remittance tool where the end users don't know that they are actually using the Bitcoin blockchain to make the transaction ( Forbes ). River Using Bitcoin as a back-end mechanism will serve to increase the demand for Bitcoin. Given that more financial institutions use Bitcoin as a payment rail, then these institutions will need to buy Bitcoin in order to process transactions. Block Inc.'s Cash App has integrated the Bitcoin lightning network onto Cash App and given Dorsey's comments above, I believe there is a significant chance that the company is working on a Bitcoin remittance solution. Another use-case that is evolving for Bitcoin is a so-called ""sats economy"". The sats economy refers to using satoshis (the smallest denomination of bitcoin) to send small tips of appreciation to others on social media. Damus used this model after it launched earlier this year, however, Apple ( AAPL ) has forced Damus to shut this feature down during the summer ( Reddit ). The problem with this use case is that it bypasses Apple's rules for in-app payments. This reflects the strength of the Bitcoin lightning network, but also the complete pushback it has received. For these reasons, I believe this catalyst is the weakest but also the most overlooked. Although nothing very concrete has materialized yet within the utility use case, it is likely soon to come... and if it does the scale could be vast. Risk The payments industry comprises many large and powerful players, including Mastercard ( MA ), Visa ( V ), and PayPal ( PYPL ). How will they look upon Bitcoin as a future payment rail? Will these companies adopt the technology or build their own offering to compete against it? PayPal, for example, has a stablecoin called PAYUSD that developers are able to build new payment layers on top of. This is very similar to the Bitcoin ecosystem and directly the opposite approach that Block Inc. has taken. Instead of building on and integrating the Bitcoin network into Venmo and PayPal, the company has created its own. Actions like this could undermine the eventual increase in demand for Bitcoin. 2. The Upcoming Bitcoin Halving Potential If you didn't already know, Bitcoin is set to halve in April 2024. This implies that the reward for mining one Bitcoin will be cut in half in April, effectively lowering the rate at which future supply enters the market. Historically, Bitcoin halvings have led to price increases in Bitcoin both before and after the halving occurs. Notice this dynamic in the image below: Crypto.com Every halving has been front-run by significant price increases. This is likely due to the supply and demand effect. As more people realize that the Bitcoin halving is coming the more Bitcoin is bought, which raises the price of the asset due to higher demand. After Bitcoin halvings have occurred, the price of the asset has gone up even more dramatically in general. We are currently about five months away from the beginning of April and we've seen a very significant price increase over the past few months. Since its January lows Bitcoin has doubled and since the end of September the Bitcoin price has increased by around 35% with steep increases in the past few days. Data by YCharts Risk Although Bitcoin halvings in the past have historically always correlated with increases in the Bitcoin price, there is no rule that this has to be the case. One risk with looking at the historical price action of Bitcoin is that the digital currency really doesn't have a long history. Since its inception, Bitcoin has only halved three times. Why will this time be the same? 3. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Potential There are currently 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs pending application: ""The applications are from Grayscale, 21Shares & Ark, BlackRock, Bitwise, VanEck, WisdomTree (""WT""), Invesco (""IVZ""), Galaxy, Fidelity, Valkyrie, Global X, Hashdex and Franklin"" ( Coindesk ). These spot ETFs generally imply that investors will be able to take part in Bitcoin's price development without buying Bitcoin directly. Hence, we can think of these brokerages/investment firms as distribution channels for Bitcoin. The more distribution channels Bitcoin has, the more consumers will be able to gain easy access to the digital asset. This will clearly increase the demand for Bitcoin. In fact, Galaxy estimated in a research report that inflows into a Bitcoin ""ETF"" could amount to $14 billion in year one, $27 billion in year two, and $39 billion in year three. Given the huge asset management industry, it is likely that asset managers begin suggesting customers allocate a small portion of their wealth into this quickly growing ""digital gold"". Galaxy Digital Research If we build upon Galaxy's logic quickly: 12 spot ETFs with $14 billion in inflows in year one would result in total inflows of $168 billion during the first year. Galaxy found that the amount of Bitcoin held under management on September 30th was $21.7 billion, or 4.3% of the current supply at the time. If Galaxy's calculations are correct, the ETF adoption would imply an almost 8x increase in the amount of Bitcoin held under management with regard to monetary value. Personally, I believe that this could be a little bit of a stretch target, which the research report also admits: ""if Bitcoin spot ETF approvals are delayed or denied, our analysis would be altered by timing and access restriction. Or if poor price performance, or any other factor, leads to lower-than-expected access or adoption to a bitcoin ETF, our estimates could prove too aggressive."" Risk Insofar, the SEC has not accepted any of the spot Bitcoin ETFs which means that much of the Bitcoin price increase could be built upon a false sense of hope. The SEC still hasn't approved anything ""citing risks such as market manipulation and fraud"" ( Kiplinger ). On top of this, the greed index which was mentioned in a recent Seeking Alpha news article suggests that the greed of Bitcoin-buying has reached the highest point since November 2021 ( Seeking Alpha ). Alternative.me 4. The Synergies of the Three Catalysts Above Based on the discussion of each of the three catalysts above, we can presume that if all of the catalysts fall in place around the same time, Bitcoin prices will receive strong momentum. This will likely not be the case for the utility catalyst for Bitcoin since I believe this is a long-term development that we may see as Bitcoin becomes more ""built into"" offerings at existing companies. However, the Bitcoin halving is certain. This catalyst is likely the strongest since it has historically always meant that Bitcoin prices will rise. If the halving event is coupled with the regulatory acceptance of spot ETFs, demand would increase (potentially by a lot as claimed by Galaxy) and the rate of supply will contract causing the price to increase. Verdict In all, I remain just as bullish on Bitcoin as a long-term investment as I did during the summer when I published my first article on the digital asset. As opposed to then, halving is nearly in sight, and the general reception of potential spot Bitcoin ETFs has been really positive. To me, these are signals that indicate that Bitcoin can continue rising, but the uncertainty of whether spot ETFs are accepted or not makes this catalyst relatively weak on its own. My belief, however, is that asset management firms are doing everything they can to influence the acceptance of these ETFs as it would give the institutions more money and a potentially broader customer base. For these reasons I rate Bitcoin a buy as a long-term investment with both short and long term catalysts on the horizon.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING | RESEARCH,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4643598-the-catalysts-are-building-for-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/19388348.jpeg

According to an update on October 25, Polygon Labs, the team behind the Ethereum sidechain, Polygon, said the move is a milestone for the project. The team claims the release of POL “paves the way for the next series of milestones in the Polygon 2.0 roadmap.” Polygon 2.0 Taking Shape: What’s In Store? The Ethereum sidechain continues to build. Despite challenges in the last bear run, which saw MATIC, the platform’s native currency, drop below $1 before crashing to spot levels, the team announced the start of Polygon 2.0, reviving developer activity. The primary objective of the upgrade is to make the network more scalable, secure, and user-friendly. To achieve this, Polygon will leverage a new consensus mechanism, proof-of-stake liquidity (POSL), which the developer claims is more efficient. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bounce Above $35,000 Puts Holder Profitability At Yearly Highs Notably, the team is developing key differences between this consensus system for Polygon 2.0. For instance, validators must stake their native tokens and liquidity to participate in the network. The liquidity provided by participating validators will then be channeled to boost the liquidity of its decentralized exchanges (DEXes). Subsequently, once Polygon 2.0 goes live, exchanges running on the sidechain will be more liquid, meaning users can easily swap tokens in a low-fee, highly scalable environment. Will MATIC Bulls Break $1? Moreover, POL will be critical for Polygon 2.0. With the token now being initiated on the Ethereum mainnet, Polygon Labs is jump-starting the process, setting the ball rolling for POL, which the team said will “power a vast ecosystem of ZK-based layer-2 chains.” The team claims POL is a “hyperproductive token” primarily designed to power a multichain ecosystem. Besides, the token will be used to settle fees, and holders will participate in governance. At the same time, those who choose to stake it will be paid in the token. Related Reading: Solana Epic Bounceback To Pre-FTX Heights: Brace Yourself For What’s Next Still, it is not clear whether this update will support MATIC prices in the long run.

Moreover, bulls have reversed the dump of October 17 and continue to power higher. From the daily chart, bull bars are banding along the upper BB, a volatility indicator.

Unfortunately that's not enough time to really dig into any of the things that's happened over the past month so here's a brief list of things I missed instead.

Things happening  The narrative  Fun fact: November starts next week. We're 5/6 of the way through 2023 and ending on a somewhat busy note.  Why it matters  Full disclosure: I've been in a courtroom with no internet access for most of the past three weeks. I'm presenting information and links below but I'm providing no real analysis or interpretations of the below, mostly because I haven't had a chance to actually look into any of it.  Breaking it down  The Wall Street Journal, citing data from a July blog post from crypto analytics firm Elliptic, said Hamas raised over $90 million in crypto. This (obviously) caused great consternation from within the crypto community, which doesn't particularly want to be associated with a terrorist organization in the wake of a major attack.  Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and around 100 other lawmakers wrote a letter to the U.S. Treasury Department and National Security Advisor asking about crypto's role in terrorism.  Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), chair of the Senate Banking Committee, said the crypto link must be looked at (citing the same letter).  Chainalysis, another analytics firm, pushed back on the WSJ reporting on the Elliptic blog post.  The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would designate all mixers (tools to obfuscate the origin and destination for funds) as a ""primary money laundering concern,"" though it also alarmed other parts of the crypto industry who said the proposed rule would capture all of decentralized finance (DeFi). Worth noting that while the timing of the publication of this proposal seems somewhat coincidental to the Hamas attack in early October, it was probably percolating internally for a while – this kind of thing does not happen overnight.  In a turn of events, Elliptic published another blog post saying its data had been misinterpreted.  Journal reporter Ian Talley tweeted out a side-by-side comparison of Elliptic's most recent blog post and what the company said in July.  Looking at the original Elliptic post, while it does provide a disclosure up top that some of the addresses are frozen by Israel's national counter-terrorism entity, it also says throughout the post that the ""wallets [are] linked to Palestinian Islamic Jihad by"" Israel's National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing of Israel, which is vague enough that I think I understand where the Journal is coming from.  Elsewhere, bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) hype was up, except wait no it wasn't, except yes it was, except no, except wait maybe X (formerly Twitter) just isn't a great source of information?

In Sam Bankman-Fried news, we do seem to be nearing the end of this trial.

Coinbase Poised to Make Final Pitch in Bid to Kill SEC Accusations Quickly: Realistically, the judge overseeing the SEC suit against Coinbase is probably not going to dismiss it at this stage. This isn't a judgment call on the merits of the SEC's argument or the strength of Coinbase's response, just an observation that we'll probably see this case advance at least a bit further.

19385022,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557559,1698285628,"Bitcoin Bullish Momentum Reignites: RSI Signals Potential Surge To $65,000","After experiencing a brief correction from its new yearly high of $35,300, Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency in the market, is showing signs of renewed bullish momentum. As the digital asset approaches the $35,000 mark again, a key indicator is following patterns observed in 2020, suggesting a potential surge that could propel Bitcoin to reclaim its previous peak of $65,000. Scott Melker, a prominent crypto investor and host of the ‘Wolf of All Streets’ podcast, notes the significance of Bitcoin’s overbought Relative Strength Index (RSI) on both lower time frames and the weekly chart, hinting at a promising trajectory for the cryptocurrency’s price. BTC’s 2020 RSI Flashback Bitcoin’s RSI, a widely used technical indicator that measures the strength and speed of price movements, is currently flashing signs of extreme overbought conditions on various lower time frames. Notably, the daily RSI stands at 88, indicating a potential need for a healthy retracement. However, the weekly RSI garners attention as it has just entered the overbought zone, a range historically associated with substantial upward movements in a true bull market. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Will Send BTC Back To $44,000, Why This Trading Firm Is Betting On This Scenario To gain insights into Bitcoin’s potential future trajectory, it is worth revisiting the patterns observed in 2020. According to Melker, during that year, Bitcoin’s RSI went overbought on the weekly chart when the cryptocurrency was trading around $12,000, as indicated by a small blue circle on the bottom left of the chart above. Subsequently, Bitcoin embarked on an unprecedented rally, surging to $65,000. This historical precedent highlights the possibility of a similar price action if true bullish catalysts emerge. With Bitcoin’s weekly RSI entering the overbought territory once again, there is a growing sentiment among market observers that the cryptocurrency has ample room to run. Scott Melker emphasizes that if significant bullish catalysts materialize, Bitcoin’s potential for further upside becomes virtually limitless. The current RSI readings hint at the potential for an extended price rally, potentially enabling Bitcoin to surpass its current highs and reach the coveted $65,000 level. Bitcoin Market Dynamics Shift As Key Indicators Surge Adding to Melker’s bullish outlook for BTC, crypto analyst Miles Deutscher has stated on X (formerly Twitter) that the Bitcoin market landscape has witnessed a notable shift in recent days, leading to a significant uptick in bullish sentiment. In particular, volume and open interest in Bitcoin-related futures and options on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) have risen to multi-month and multi-year highs, indicating growing interest and participation from institutional investors. Moreover, call options open interest has surpassed the peak levels seen during the 2021 bull run. In tandem with these developments, average crypto-related stocks have experienced a substantial uptick, and public funds have seen a massive influx of $43 million into Bitcoin, equivalent to 10% of the year-to-date inflows, all within a single day. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Falls 80%, Is It Time To Sell? These metrics reflect increased trading activity and liquidity in the Bitcoin derivatives market, indicating heightened institutional interest. Such a surge in trading volume often precedes significant price movements, leading some analysts to anticipate a potential bullish breakout shortly. Another encouraging sign for Bitcoin’s prospects lies in the call options open interest, which has recently surpassed $10 billion. To put this into context, during the peak of the 2021 bull run, call options open interest reached $9.9 billion. This milestone suggests that market participants are increasingly positioning themselves for a potential rise in Bitcoin’s price. The growing number of call options indicates a bullish sentiment among traders, further fueling expectations of a potential price surge. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $34,500, successfully reclaiming the level it briefly lost during a recent correction on Tuesday. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has maintained gains of 1.4%.

In a Medium post on October 24, the platform said as part of this change in approach, they will be expanding the functionality of their Loopring Dapp. Loopring Going Multi-Network: Will This Spark Activity? Under Loopring’s new shift, there will be two parts of the Dapp in Loopring Pro and Earn functionalities. Furthermore, the Dapp’s Smart Wallet will become multi-network, opening up more users in diverse but supported platforms. Loopring Dapp was one of the three core pillars in the previous setup. Specifically, the Loopring zk-Rollups protocol formed the core infrastructure through which the layer-2 solution will scale all their products while relying on Ethereum’s security. Related Reading: Will Ethereum Rally Continue? These Could Be The Factors To Watch Loopring Pro Dapp was a portal through which decentralized finance (DeFi) users would interact with the Loopring DEX and other services. On the other hand, the Loopring Smart Wallet will be a tool where users can store assets securely. This wallet is baked into Loopring Pro Dapp. Following the announcement, the team said the Loopring Earn DApp will serve as the “lighter” version of the Pro service on the platform. A notable difference is that it has been reworked to be more customizable and can be deployed in any other compatible network via the Loopring zk-Rollups protocol. The layer-2 protocol continues to build. Presently, the latest iteration of their DEX, version 3.6, the team said, has processed over 12 million transactions, generating more than $6 billion in trading volume. Since launching, the DEX has connected over 210,000 layer-2 wallets. Even so, the team plans not to build on this update. The strategy will be to deploy on platforms like Arbitrum, where it can serve as a layer-2 or layer-3, creating a “highly optimized app-chain experience.” While at it, the team hopes to expand and scale their “new core products,” creating more opportunities for DeFi users.
