42397155,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaZ0F4,1369411255,California dreaming: The CoinDesk Weekly Review,"Do you know the way to San Jose? John Law does, having spent some time there in the '90s, and can report that -- apart from the song and the deeply strange Rosicrucians -- there’s little to recommend the place. Milton Keynes with palm trees.  Yet it’s that strange mixture of the tediously prosaic and unnervingly weird that makes it the ideal place for a Bitcoin conference. And last weekend’s Bitcoin 2013 did not disappoint, combining earnest discussions about taxation and regulation with vodka brand launches, rap singers and revolutionaries. And as San Jose is also the heart of Silicon Valley, it’s fitting that veterans of the last revolution, when the internet grew from technical oddity to global machine, were there with some solid ideas to guide cryptocurrency on the same path.  Which is why the odd couple of ex-banker Jordan Modell and Internet Archive founder Brewster Kabel fitted right in. The pair have form, having started up the Internet Archive Federal Credit Union last year to support low-income families in New Brunswick, New Jersey -- which, despite its name and provenance, is a pretty normal affair -- and, crucially, is regulator-approved and complaint.  As IEEE Spectrum reports, this is where Modell and Kabel think Bitcoin and its ilk needs most help -- a perception that looks pretty spot-on to most. Credit unions have to be squeaky clean, filing regular reports to the authorities, maintaining a close relationship with their customers, and noting any suspicious activities that could indicate criminal involvement. Which is exactly the sort of thing that regulators are most concerned about in the rather ad hoc and murky world of online exchanges and other interfaces between cryptocurrencies and the old-fashioned world of hard cash.  Modell and Kabel can help with the paperwork, as well as providing finance and a reassuring track record of existing relationships with the law. What’s more, they want to... seeing Bitcoin as a useful social instrument and one that will over time become part of the financial landscape. From that vantage point, it makes sense to get in early and become some of the founding fathers. From the point of view of Bitcoin fans, this is precisely the sort of move -- and the sort of movers -- that are absolutely necessary to get past the birth pains and into what will doubtless be a gawky but promising adolescence. Even if it does mean less vodka.  Not mining, but melting  John Law has been vastly entertained by Butterfly Labs’ saga in the world of hardware. The idea is simple: build custom hardware that’s devoted to doing the maths behind Bitcoin mining. The ASIC -- application-specific integrated circuit -- at the heart of the design can in theory be far more efficient (read, faster) than the general-purpose processors and graphic processors that make PCs so flexible. Result: riches.  Or so goes the theory. Anyone who’s actually been involved in custom hardware design, especially involving ASICs, will know that practice can be very different. For while it is possible, indeed compulsory, to run extensive simulations of your circuit before committing to build it, there’s more to making it work than knowing the design can add up the numbers properly.  Butterfly Labs has found this out, as it finally starts to ship its products to punters who’ve been waiting over a year for their silicon cashpoints. As Coindesk’s own Danny Bradbury reports, this is almost certainly due to over-optimistic expectations of how much power they’ll use: the mathematics of how many watts it takes to crunch a lot of numbers are unforgiving and have sunk many a project -- just ask Microsoft -- as all that heat will cook your chips.  Being, like Danny, a veteran of the old days of computing, John Law recalls wistfully the epic delays enjoyed in the 1980s by would-be customers of Sinclair Research and Acorn Computers, some of which were also caused by overheating ASICs. The experience of that sunk Sinclair, but provoked Acorn to design an ultra-low-power processor called ARM that has long outlived its parent company and now powers just about every tablet and smartphone on the planet.  Butterfly should take heart, roll up their sleeves and get creative. And if they can’t cut down the heat, then they should take a leaf from another successful playbook, that of the custom PC makers and supercomputer manufacturers. Arming your device with a cooling system that looks like a mutant V8 engine powered by exotic fluids not only solves your problem but lets you push performance and get a particularly dedicated band of followers. Bonus points for using liquid nitrogen ... and if you use one of these, you win the internet.  All at sea  One of the more intriguing aspects of cryptocurrencies is that they exist independently of a sovereign state -- a status also enjoyed by gold, especially since the major currencies came off the gold standard. But what if one was adopted as a state currency? It’s an interesting idea, and one that fits into the current, slightly schizophrenic attitude the West has toward making currencies independent of government control.  Enter Sealand, an ""independent"" but unrecognized microstate run by one bloke on an abandoned military fort in the North Sea. It’s a splendid mixture of eccentricity, loopholes in international law and a gift shop ... and harks back, in the words of one judge who had to decide whether it was part of the UK, to the swashbuckling days of Francis Drake.  Drake, of course, was no stranger to unconventional currency transactions, helping himself liberally to Spanish silver on his way back from the Americas ... being careful, of course, to do it in the name of Good Queen Bess. She was more than happy to accept her cut -- a sovereign lesson to Bitcoin proponents that, technically, you can do what you like but practically it helps to grease the palm of the people with actual armies.  Such considerations don’t much matter to Sealand, which has already faced down the Royal Navy and won -- that judge decided it was properly offshore and thus couldn’t be blown up at whim. Bitcoin seems a natural fit -- or potentially so, once it stops being more volatile than the North Sea’s other notable export. It’s also attracting the attention of another maritime project, the Seasteaders, who propose to build independent floating communities. Such grand ideas make more and more sense -- or at least, seem less and less implausible -- now so much economic activity is digital and can be conducted from anywhere you can get a satellite signal.  Bitcoin and its ilk fit so well into these ideas that they almost seem custom-designed for the job. Unlike the almighty dollar, once established and accepted they don’t need the compliance of state-regulated banks and, as they have an entirely digital existence, you don’t need to take on the risks of ferrying physical lumps of stuff through potentially hostile environments filled with lots of aggressive people with big floaty gunships.  Not much good for Drake, but expect more action from the other salty dogs.  John Law  is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler. Having reformed the French economy, invented paper currency, state banks, the Mississippi Bubble and other ideas essential to modern economics, he took three hundred years off in a small cottage outside Bude.

42397159,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaZ0I1,1369408240,Canada tops list for 2013 Bitcoin software downloads,"By nearly all measures, Bitcoin has seen impressive growth, especially over the last couple of months. But where is that growth coming from? An economic researcher at BTC Global has measured Bitcoin saturation by looking at downloads of the Bitcoin client from Sourceforge by country.  In a blog post, Colin Osterman notes that, although some people downloading from Sourceforge are simply updating their software, many are downloading for the first time. Sourceforge breaks the information down by day, by country, and even by operating system.  Osterman looked at the number of downloads per capita year-to-date, with Canada coming out on top, followed by Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States and Germany.  Osterman says countries at the bottom of the list should not be ignored, because they are the most interesting.  “Some of the most exciting growth is happening in regions where saturation is currently low,” he writes.  Although China is well down the list of year-to-date downloads per capita, that country has seen an explosion in downloads this month, with 42 percent of its year-to-date downloads occurring in May, Osterman said.  He added, “Brazil is another country to watch, with 29 percent, followed by Taiwan and South Korea, each with 23 percent.”  The data set was limited to larger countries, including only those with a population greater than 20 million and more than 500 downloads year-to-date. That eliminates the Nordic countries, but Osterman notes that -- collectively -- Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland have the greatest Bitcoin saturation.  Looking at the latest data from Sourceforge, there have been nearly 240,000 Bitcoin software downloads since the beginning of May, with 32 percent of downloaders coming from China and 84 percent using Windows. Year-to-date, downloads total 1.3 million, with the top country of origin for downloaders being the United States, at 27 percent of downloads.  The US also tops the list of total downloads year-to-date -- around 350,000. That's nearly double that of China, second on the list, which is followed by the United Kingdom.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Doug Watt,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/24/canada-tops-list-for-2013-bitcoin-software-downloads,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dc44762a818c57bb6868f2da090df71b88e31acb-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376483,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6Ajyb,1369391134,"Chinese whispers hit Bitcoin, again","Rumours suggesting the Chinese government was moving to block Bitcoin related traffic on its networks have been dismissed.  News stories about China routinely get traction without being checked and elements of the Bitcoin community seem happy to believe anything which fits with their world view.  But forum posters on Bitcointalk quickly moved to quash rumours that Chinese telcos were being warned to block bitcoin-related traffic.  The original poster quoted a supposed email which said:  ""We got further information from our carrier confirming that business such as bitcoin is not a proper financial tool in China and the Authority may treat bitcoin as an illegal business. Unfortunately the China Telecom Authority has requested that all bit-coin traffic to China be blocked.""  But other posters reported using China Telcom networks without problems.  China's convoluted censorship system, called Golden Shield, doesn't usually email people with explanations either.  Data from Sourceforge showed that Chinese computers were continuing to download thousands of Bitcoin clients - see here for the Sourceforge charts.  Blockchain.info also showed recent connections to China-based bitcoin nodes.  China has moved up the rankings to second place behind the US for Bitcoin client downloads, and shows no sign of slipping yet.  The original thread is here.  A previous Chinese Bitcoin rumour was that the People's Republic was about to back Bitcoin - the basis for this was a documentary on Chinese state television.

42376486,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6Ak2N,1369389175,Why do 'Seasteaders' love Bitcoin?,"Bitcoin represents more than a digital currency. For many adopters, it is a means of breaking free of government and financial institutions’ control over money.  The Seasteading Institute  shares those ideals. Just as libertarians in the Bitcoin community see the currency as a way to get free of fiat and avoid the financial transaction roadblocks erected at national boundaries or through credit regulations, seasteaders put their hope into the idea of new, independent cities as a way to escape the stranglehold of government systems.  Since April 2009, the Seasteading Institute has been working toward the goal of bringing about permanent, innovative communities that float at sea. The organization is headed by prominent libertarians, including Patri Friedman, the son of political theorist David Friedman and grandson of economist Milton Friedman.  Friedman stepped down as chief executive of the institute in early 2012, though he retains the position of chairman.  While creating a viable, floating city would cost billions of dollars, Friedman has insisted that funding is not the real obstacle to bringing the project to life.  “The challenge is getting people to see that this can be a route to political reform,” he said.  The Seasteading Institute lays out its goals like this:  The Seasteading Institute wishes to enable the creation of ocean city-states in order to advance humanity through innovative startup governments. We believe that competition in government will lead to better government for the whole planet. Governments are ultimately the stewards of institutions, which are more or less the “rules of the game.” Looking around the world, it is easy to see that some countries have better rules than others. Good or bad, however, rules can become entrenched in the absence of competition from new market entrants. Currently no new governments can peacefully enter the “governance market,” but with seasteading, experimentation with new rules is possible.  PayPal  cofounder Peter Thiel echoed that idea in an article in a Details magazine article titled, “The Billionaire King of Techtopia.”  Thiel has noted, “When you start a company, true freedom is at the beginning of things.” He also draws a parallel to the inception of the US government.  “The United States Constitution had things you could do at the beginning that you couldn’t do later,” he said. What he seeks to explore is a way to begin fresh, with all the possibilities that suggests.  Thiel has supported The Seasteading Institute since its beginning. In 2008, he donated $500,000, the same amounted he put into Facebook in 2004. Subsequent donations have brought his total contribution to around $1.25 million.  The Seasteading Institute’s philosophy dovetails with the views Thiel espoused in an April 2009 essay for the Cato Institute, “The Education of a Liberatarian.” In that piece, he declares that libertarians must get beyond restrictive government systems by finding a place of their own:  ""The critical question then becomes one of means, of how to escape not via politics but beyond it. Because there are no truly free places left in our world, I suspect that the mode for escape must involve some sort of new and hitherto untried process that leads us to some undiscovered country; and for this reason I have focused my efforts on new technologies that may create a new space for freedom.""  Thiel identifies three possible spaces in which to find that freedom: cyberspace, outer space and the seas. He explains his support for seasteading this way: “From my vantage point, the technology involved is more tentative than the internet, but much more realistic than space travel … It is a realistic risk, and for this reason I eagerly support this initiative.”  Thiel is also betting on the success of Bitcoin, as his Founders Fund has invested in the Bitcoin merchant services firm BitPay. In fact, Bitcoin might in fact be the realization of what Thiel once envisioned for PayPal.  Though we think of PayPal today as just another part of the standard payment system, like Visa or MasterCard, Thiel’s early goals were far more radical and ambitious.  As the Details article revealed, PayPal was intended to serve “the techno-cool libertarian ideal: a way of emancipating money from government’s monopolistic clutches.” That ideal was even reflected in early company-issued shirts, which bore the legend, “THE NEW WORLD CURRENCY.”  Ken Howery,  one of PayPal’s co-founders, explained that Thiel was convinced that “people should be able to store their money in any currency they wanted, without fear of governments devaluing it.” While PayPal has gone on to great success as a company, it’s fallen far short of those libertarian ideals.  Bitcoin, however, has awakened new hope for the ultimate solution to a government-free currency ... which is one of the concerns of Seasteaders. One policy recommended by the Seasteading Mission Statement addresses the monetary system, emphasizing -- for example -- that the “Gold Standard would be set back in place.”  The proposed policy stresses it is not gold per se that is essential -- what's needed is for the monetary system to be determined by the marketplace rather by a governing authority: “So as libertarians, we really shouldn't advocate a gold standard as it might imply that we think the government should manage it. For a truly free market, it is the marketplace that should decide on what will be used as money. Most likely, I would bet my fiat money that the market would choose gold again.”  For many today, though, the answer is to be found not in gold but in “Gold 2.0,, as Bitcoin as been dubbed. A recent Reason article explained that, while people have in the past looked to gold as a shelter from inflation and currency crashes, “the high-tech Bitcoin cryptocurrency recently stepped in to fill that role in a more portable way.”  Mike Caldwell,  the creator of Casascius Coins put it this way:  ""Bitcoin is two things. It’s a community, and it’s a technology ... because Bitcoin is just today’s embodiment of the idea that we now have the technology to democratize money.”  In the same way, seasteaders seek to harness community and technology to establish a new type of civilization, one where Bitcoin could serve as a currency not tied to any nation and allowing free transactions among all.  Incidentally, The Seasteading Institute does accept Bitcoin donations. (It also notes, however, that the US government does not recognize these as tax-deductible contributions."")",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Ariella Brown,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/24/why-do-seasteaders-love-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f0ee0928b8c29afcbfb1a99ceb57b6d45c18c528-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376490,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6Ak8f,1369380168,UK firm promises Skype-style Bitcoin exchange,"We've had independent cryptocurrency exchanges, ""roll-your-own"" cloud-based exchange services ... and now it looks as though we are heading towards complete decentralization.  Welcome to the Skype of bitcoin exchanges.  A new company is about to launch a service that it says will entirely decentralize alternative currency exchanges, making it practically impossible for regulators to shut them down. MetaLair -- based in Sussex in the UK -- will soon unveil an open-source software client that will serve as a cryptocurrency wallet and exchange client. While traditional exchanges need a back-end trading system, this won't.  There have been very few other attempts at P2P bitcoin exchanges. Dark Exchange is a client that posts searchable bitcoin trade requests online. But the as-yet unnamed MetaLair product will apparently go far further. According to co-founder Jonathan Turrall, it will enable trading directly from one client to another, in any cryptocurrency, while also warding off the double-spending problem.  Turrall likened it to a Skype for cryptocurrency exchanges. Just as Skype decentralized the VoIP network, so this will fragment and distribute the exchange of cryptocurrencies. But unlike Skype, which is proprietary, this will be an open protocol, replicable by anyone.  Users will be able to exchange any cryptocurrency on the network without having it approved by an exchange, Turrall said. Currently, exchanges must approve the currencies that can be swapped on their network, leading to patchy – and in some cases nonexistent – exchange support for many alternative currencies. Incumbent Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox is still mulling the inclusion of Litecoin, but there are many others (more, even, than listed here).  Exchange centralization and dependence on the banking network has been a problem for Bitcoin in the past. Mt. Gox, which processes around 80 percent of exchange transactions, has suffered from DDoS attacks. Other exchanges have been hacked. Almost half of all exchanges succumb to these problems and shut down.  Regulators are also coming down increasingly hard on exchanges that don’t comply with their rules. Most recently, Mt. Gox funds held by a subsidiary of the exchange and the Dwolla payment service were seized by US authorities, who claimed that Mt. Gox didn’t have the necessary money services businesses license. Bitcoin 24 had its bank account shuttered by law enforcement.  ""You’re going to get people who are swapping dollars for bitcoins, and it will be one bank account transaction, where they see $100 move from one person’s bank account to another. They won’t be able to see the blockchain on the other side of that. So how do you stop that?” Turrall said. “This is a genuinely distributed infrastructure.”  In some cases, banks themselves have pulled an exchange’s account after it was found not to have a money services businesses license. Turrall argued that a P2P exchange would solve that problem.  “You’d have to yank the thousands of small accounts for small-dollar transactions from thousands of users, which you’d have to spot,” he said.  Eli Dourado, a research fellow at the Mercatus Center, a market economics think tank at George Mason University, studies the effect of cryptocurrencies. He is in favor of a P2P exchange.  “I think that the trend is towards decentralization, and I think especially if there’s a regulatory crackdown, which seems to be on its way, that idea of being totally decentralized will be attractive to a lot of people,” Dourado said.  MetaLair isn’t aiming to just hack policy problems with its P2P exchange, however; it wants to avoid a technical one: double spending.  Double spending is a theoretical problem in which currency can be spent twice. In theory, a malicious party could refute a cryptocurrency transaction, and spend currency twice. This becomes particularly problematic if one entity should gain control of over half of the transaction processing power (hashing power) on the Bitcoin network ... because that party could then claim with more authenticity that its transaction records are authentic.  “Our system guarantees that you can’t have a double-spending attack within the window of confirmation that you guarantee,” Turrall said.  Turrall isn’t giving much away about the technology behind the system, as MetaLair is still hoping to attract £200,000 in funding, either through donations or investment. He’ll have to unveil details at some point, though, because he says the firm will open-source everything, creating a free client available for download.  If that's the case, how will Turrall and MetaLair make any money?  “Alongside the distributed infrastructure exchange that we’re building, we’ll provide our own proprietary software that will add benefit,” Turrall said. This is how he’s offering benefit to investors: “It will be free to use, but you will have a company with an enormous, multi-million-user base.”  That would be a captive audience indeed.  So, there will be two clients: one that tech-savvy users will compile themselves, and the other, packaged for a less technical, broader audience. That will be where the firm makes its revenue, rather than on commissions from network trades.  “We will also add our own security and encryption stuff into that (client), which will provide added security to your coins,” Turrall added.  The company's web site, MetaLair.org, will be active by the weekend, Turrall said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/24/uk-firm-promises-skype-style-bitcoin-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a5d62f6f69d771db17c232325dc9ebd2adc4ee5c-1000x666.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
