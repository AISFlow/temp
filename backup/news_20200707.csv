42384034,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0EuZ,1594159269,How Apple's COVID-19 Policy Limited a Public Health App in Taiwan,"The Taiwanese startup Bitmark, which participated in a government-sponsored hackathon in May, was unable to promote its blockchain solution due to Apple’s pandemic moderation policy.      “We were trying to essentially build a weather forecast but for public health,” said Bitmark CEO Sean Moss-Pultz. “It allowed people to volunteer their symptoms and what they are trying to do to get better, and connect that to public data from public health offices.”      Precisely because the World Health Organization excludes Taiwan, the small Asian nation has developed a unique set of software tools for combatting COVID-19. However, the Apple store only lists health apps published by government entities or nonprofits. This means the small nation’s startup community has limited access to mobile device users. (Apple did not respond to requests for comment by press time.)      According to a report by the analytics and accelerator company AppWorks, there are now roughly 112 blockchain startups in Taiwan, including the supply chain management startup BSOS, which received an investment from Taiwan’s National Development Fund earlier this year.      Read more: Austrian Government Funds Development of Blockchain-Based COVID-19 App      “What are the next growth opportunities for blockchain? Everyone has different interpretations and expectations,” the AppWorks report said. “However, currently, conversations are mostly centered around the pandemic, with criticisms mainly targeted at the limitations and failures of centralization.”      Moss-Pultz said his firm experienced those limitations firsthand. The mainstream app stores would only accept the resulting app, called Autonomy, if the Taiwanese government itself released the mobile app.      “People all around the world are getting their apps blocked,” Moss-Pultz said. “We spent most of June trying to figure out what type of strategy we could have. … Most likely we’re just going to [release Autonomy] as a web thing.”    Incentives    Apple and Google are hardly the only tech giants defining the public pandemic narratives. Amazon, for example, forced bitcoin advocate Knut Svanholm to remove a brief mention of the coronavirus from his self-published book in order to distribute it through Kindle in April.      As the Svanholm incident illustrated, moderating health tools during a pandemic without resulting in blunt-force censorship is a difficult task to automate.      Colin Steil, co-founder of the Taiwanese blockchain startup Cartesi, said tech companies “always have to proceed with caution” to avoid their software being “used to cause unrest or disrupt in political issues.”      Internet giants can be accused of censorship regardless of whether they moderate content. Companies like Facebook and Twitter are both heavily criticized for rampant misinformation campaigns on their platforms, although they took radically different approaches to moderation. (Facebook has since recanted and said it will change its policies, due to public pressure.) Critics seem to consider the opposite of censorship to be, not digital anarchy, but consistently high-quality moderation.      Read more: Social Media Bans ‘Highlight the Profound Censorship on Web 2.0’      Steil said that compared to stringent but relatively healthy Taiwan, American leaders were “stalled for many reasons” in reacting to the pandemic and “reliant on tech companies” to offer solutions.      “Taiwan took the pandemic very seriously due to its prior experience with viruses, and reacted in a method that used whatever tools and tech they had available,” Steil said, highlighting the contrast in public policies.      Blockchain Commons founder Christopher Allen, who collaborated with Bitmark at the May hackathon and is an advocate for decentralized identity tech, said “good actors” at Silicon Valley’s tech giants are often “stymied” by company objectives.      So far, American tech companies dominate public services, sometimes even running servers for government agencies, he said, in ways other private companies cannot compete with.      “Their strategies have been to vertically integrate and limit other people,” Allen said of companies like Google, Facebook and Apple. “I don’t think their intent is malicious in any fashion, but the nature of keeping competition out has a potential harm.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/07/how-apples-covid-19-policy-limited-a-public-health-app-in-taiwan,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23ec20e0896e311ddcb39b2dca501c194ac88ae3-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384038,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0EyL,1594155432,DeFi Driving Chainlink’s Link Token to Record Highs,"Chainlink’s link token jumped to record highs on Monday, far surpassing bitcoin’s returns since the start of 2020. The ever-increasing use of Chainlink’s price oracles in decentralized finance (DeFi) is driving the cryptocurrency higher, according to analysts.      The 12th largest cryptocurrency by market value clocked a lifetime high of $5.72 at 11:45 UTC (7:45 a.m. ET) and was last trading at $5.65, representing over 200% gains on a year-to-date basis.      Meanwhile, bitcoin is down more than 50% from its lifetime high of $20,000 reached in December 2017 and has gained only 29% so far this year, according to data source Coin Metrics.      The link cryptocurrency has decoupled from bitcoin, the crypto market leader. Observers are associating link’s massive rally with Chainlink’s increased usage in the decentralized finance space.      “We’re attributing this short-term price spike to Chainlink’s scaled usage in the DeFi space,” said Vance Spencer, co-founder of Framework Ventures, which is one of the largest private holders of link tokens. “The market cap for DeFi projects have quintupled in the last half year, and most of the ecosystem is now relying on (or planning to rely on) Chainlink for connecting on-chain DeFi smart contracts to off-chain data feeds like commodities and crypto price data.“      Read more: Investment Firm Plans ETF-Like Product for Compound Yield Farmers      Meanwhile, Simon Peters, crypto market analyst at investment platform eToro said, “The crypto asset has been displaying a bullish trend for some time now, with Chainlink making all the right noises by partnering with a number of projects in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.”      Chainlink is a system of oracles built on top of the Ethereum blockchain that supplies data to decentralized blockchains. For example, if two users bet on the outcome of a binary event, the oracle will tell the smart contract which user won, so it can pay the winning bettor.      With Chainlink, the advantage is that it supplies data to smart contracts in a decentralized way, or from multiple sources. That ensures the security and reliability of the blockchain, which can be compromised in case the oracle depends on a single source. For instance, lending protocol bZx suffered multiple hacks in February as the platform once used Kyber Network as a single oracle, or supplier of asset prices.      Hence, the DeFi industry has turned to Chainlinks. Major names in the DeFi space including Kyber Network, AVA, Graph Protocol, Opium Network, Synthetix and now bZx have integrated Chainlink’s oracles, according to its official blog. Chainlink’s official twitter handle has announced at least two partnerships every week over the last two months.      The cryptocurrency may have received an additional boost from Chainlink’s association with China’s national blockchain project. “The importance of the Chinese government choosing to integrate Chainlink oracles into their national blockchain services network (BSN) cannot be understated,” said Spencer.    Looking forward    “Long term, we expect Chainlink’s value to continue to appreciate. We believe that the smart contract platform that eventually becomes the standard for Web3 will be valued at several factors higher than Ethereum’s current market cap. If that is the case, then it's natural to assume that its security layer, Chainlink, will significantly grow in value as well,” said Spencer.      Some observers are of the opinion Chainlink is best positioned to benefit from the ongoing multi-year shift in focus from base layer chains to the middleware services that provide security for data feeds.      Read more: Tether CTO Claims USDT Stablecoin Can Boost DeFi Liquidity      Further, the lure of earning additional by staking link tokens could drive demand for the cryptocurrency. “The idea that users could someday earn a steady income stream for participating in the crowdsourcing of useful data for smart contracts is likely to be attractive to institutional and educated retail investors alike,” said Spencer.      In Chainlink's ecosystem, staking involves depositing link tokens in a node in order to be able to undertake jobs that require collateral or joining a staking poll in order to connect blockchain to off-chain data, as noted by crypto exchange Exodus.    Short-term correction ahead?    With the flow of coins toward exchanges recently jumping to the highest level since March, there’s a chance the cryptocurrency could witness a short-term pullback.      Exchange net flow, or the difference between volume flowing into and out of exchanges, rose to 3,482, the highest since March 14, according to data provided by the blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.      Investors tend to move cryptocurrency from their wallets to exchanges to be able to more quickly liquidate holdings during a price crash or when they expect a price pullback.      “From a technical perspective, link just broke past its largest resistance level at ~$4.90 and is now in price discovery mode both in terms of BTC and USD,"" said Connor Abendschein, crypto research analyst at Digital Assets Data.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | KNC | LINK | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/07/defi-driving-chainlinks-link-token-to-record-highs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/04d994c4097bf66713936ee9b7f9d8fa3f1e1cf5-719x464.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384042,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0F3N,1594154347,"Market Wrap: With Low Volatility, Traders Seem to Like $9,000 Bitcoin","Over the past month, while market action has been relatively quiet, crypto traders have punched the buy button when bitcoin’s price drops below $9,000.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $9,208 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), slipping 0.80% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $9,201-$9,379  BTC above 10-day and 50-day moving average, a bullish signal for market technicians, although trading volumes on Tuesday are lower than Monday.    “Bitcoin managed to approach the level of $9,300, after which immediately rolled back to the $9,250 area,” said Constantine Kogan, partner at cryptocurrency fund of funds BitBull Capital. “The coin continues to trade in a narrow price range,” he said, adding that crypto markets are experiencing record low volatility.      Read More: Exchanges See Drop in Volumes as Bitcoin Volatility Approaches 2020 Low      “Such low volatility is uncharacteristic of bitcoin,” said Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5. “However, this sentiment has permeated through the trading community.”      Less volatility has translated into fewer options bets. Open interest has dropped since the June 26 expiration date and is now hovering at the $1.1 billion mark. That’s quite a bit off from where it was in June, when it hit a record $1.8 billion high, according to derivatives data aggregator Skew.      The lack of action is causing vigilant traders to change their strategies. For example, there appears to be sentiment that bitcoin at $9,000 is a good price point for traders to buy. “Every time the market has poked its nose below $9,000, buyers have stepped in,” said Rupert Douglas, head of institutional sales at London-based broker Koine.      Indeed, over the past month, when the world’s oldest cryptocurrency dipped below $9,000, traders scooped it up on spot markets like Coinbase.      Douglas says the narrow bitcoin price action might not last because most traders surely would like more volatility, which is what attracts many to crypto in the first place. “Bitcoin is coiled for a big move,” he told CoinDesk. “I still favor the upside. I think we will see bitcoin heading above $11,000 in short order when a move comes.”      Read More: Lightspeed Invests $2.8M in Crypto Market Maker Wintermute    Kyber DEX upgrade skyrockets token    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was in the red Tuesday, trading around $237, down 0.66% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

42384036,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0Ex5,1594153182,Nearly $60M in Bitcoin Moved to Ethereum in June,"Nearly $60 million worth of bitcoins moved to Ethereum during June, according to data estimates from Dune Analytics. Wrapped Bitcoin, the oldest tokenized bitcoin protocol on Ethereum, is responsible for roughly 75% of that growth after moving more than 4,800 BTC to Ethereum last month.      Demand has increased for using bitcoin in a variety of decentralized financial services as Ethereum continues to be the most popular off-chain destination for bitcoins. More specifically, yield farming and MakerDAO adding tokenized bitcoin as collateral are likely strong catalysts, said Medio Demarco, former associate at Deutsche Bank and co-founder of cryptocurrency research firm Delphi Digital.      “The recent trend shouldn't come as a surprise and will probably continue,” Demarco told CoinDesk.      The increasing popularity of tokenized bitcoin is also no surprise to Ben Chan, CTO at BitGo, the cryptocurrency payments processor that spearheaded Wrapped Bitcoin. “The purpose of WBTC is to bring bitcoin to the world of decentralized finance,” Chan said. “Yield opportunities for lending and supplying WBTC” in Ethereum-based applications are driving recent growth, he added.      Currently $132 million worth of bitcoin is on Ethereum, at the time of publication, or roughly 0.08% of the leading cryptocurrency’s market capitalization, according to OnChainFX.      Is the growing demand to use bitcoin on Ethereum a positive signal for the leading cryptocurrency? According to Demarco, the trend has a “synergistic” effect for both blockchains.      Chan agreed, telling CoinDesk that, for Ethereum, growth in the value of assets on decentralized finance applications is “a step towards the maturation of trustless and transparent financial services.” For Bitcoin, the benefit comes from being able to earn yield and collateralize bitcoin,” which “adds incentive” for users to invest in the cryptocurrency, according to Chan.

42384029,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0En1,1594144020,Delta Exchange Predicts $40 Price for COMP Ahead of Governance Token Deluge,"One startup founder has done the math and he thinks the true value for the COMP token right now should be more like $40.      The governance token for the Compound lending platform has been trading between $172 and $215 over the last seven days, according to CoinGecko, after touching a yield-farming-fueled high of $373 on June 21.      Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, a derivatives marketplace for cryptocurrency, ascribed COMP's high prices to ""initial euphoria.""      Read more: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained      Delta Exchange said the analysis was provided to help the market better price governance tokens as other startups look to replicate COMP's success. In an email to CoinDesk sent via an external PR firm, Delta Exchange said it hoped to deflate the typical boom-and-bust cycle for new crypto tokens.    COMP craze    Compound began distributing its governance token on June 15, kicking off a yield farming craze throughout the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. COMP remains the most sought-after asset of the nascent crop of DeFi governance tokens. The asset remains lucrative to ""mine"" by using the Compound product.      Delta Exchange analyzed the price and determined that a reasonable estimate for a market price is much lower, however. The high price right now can be explained in part by a lack of liquidity, the firm said. The smart contract that governs COMP allows for 10 million tokens to exist, but not even close to that many are actually on the market.      ""As more and more supply is released every day, an equilibrium will be established and price will start to normalize,"" Balani said via a spokesperson.      CoinGecko shows the circulating supply at 3 million tokens. The COMP governance design sets aside 40% of the 10 million token supply to be distributed to Compound users each day over the next four years.      Read more: Some Numbers That Show Why Yield Farming COMP Is So Seductive      In late June, Andrey Belyakov gave a similar price estimate (when COMP's liquidity was $70 million lower) in a Medium post on ways to short COMP, including on his company's own platform, Opium. He placed the price at $30 at that time.      At a price more in line with these estimates, Belyakov noted, it would no longer be profitable to take out a loan on Compound. Instead, fresh COMP would provide a light discount on a loan's interest rate, in the form of cashback, which he describes as a ""healthy and sustainable mechanism.""    Why $40?    Delta's estimate is based on fundamentals in a world where all COMP are liquid. Co-founder Jitender Tokas provided the analysis that justified the $40 price estimate.      Tokas assumed that eventually much of the current borrowing will unwind as COMP price recedes and people borrow less just to earn COMP and borrow for more organic reasons. He estimated the natural borrowing rate at approximately $400 million. Then he suggested a 5x multiple of Compound's book, noting that a 2x to 3x multiple is typically allowed for a normal bank, as a way of capturing stronger potential growth for a new product.      Read more: Delta Exchange Launches Crypto Interest Rate Swaps      The most generous allowance Tokas made was for the value of governance rights. He noted that in the equities market the value of voting versus non-voting shares is typically only about 5%, but there are many differences in Compound. It has less oversight and COMP holders have more powers. So Delta estimated the governance powers at 20% of the economic value of Compound.      So Delta's analysis can be written as follows:    COMP Value = ($400 million loan book X a forward valuation multiple of 5 X 20% value for governance powers ) / 10 million total tokens = $40    The Delta Exchange team believes there will be many more tokens like this. Tokas wrote:    ""The aim of this report is to give the people in the ecosystem a framework for valuing governance tokens. The success of COMP will inevitably result in many more governance tokens to hit the market. If we are to avoid creating pump and dump cycles, we need market consensus on how to value these tokens.""",NEUTRAL,COMP,COMP | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/07/delta-exchange-predicts-40-price-for-comp-ahead-of-governance-token-deluge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/081de6673399a8bc53ab726edebcc5d583f531f1-1920x1200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here's the story:      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Crypto Loans More than 75 companies in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry collected at least $30 million from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a program meant to provide loans to small businesses affected by the COVID-19-led economic fallout, CoinDesk has found. According to information published Monday by the U.S. Small Business Administration, loan recipients include Zcash developer Electric Coin Company, Ethereum venture studio ConsenSys and several crypto venture firms.      Binance: Wins and Losses Binance, the world’s biggest crypto exchange by trading volume, has donated 27,000 KN95 masks worth more than $60,000 to the U.K. National Health Service’s Pru Trust. Binance Charity recently created the PPE Token stablecoin, which has been used to track the delivery of masks and other equipment to hospitals. That's as the exchange acquired crypto wallet app Swipe.io. Swipes wallet is available in more than 30 countries and allows users to purchase items with crypto via a Visa debit card. In less positive news, the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) on Monday ordered Binance to immediately cease offering derivatives trading in the country.      Lightning Bug Researchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem have detailed vulnerabilities in Bitcoin’s Lightning Network that could lead to a loss of funds. The attack, explained in a paper called “Flood & Loot: A Systemic Attack on the Lightning Network,” games the slow confirmation times on Bitcoin’s network, Lightning’s “hash time-locked contracts” and the difference in settlement times.      Benz on the Blockchain? Ocean Protocol has completed a proof-of-concept with Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler, showing how blockchain can begin monetizing data streams within the company and across its supply chains. Announced Tuesday, the Singapore-based Ocean collaborated with Daimler AG to explore the decentralized sharing of internal sales and financial data among the multinational’s production hubs, and externally between some of its supply chain procurement partners.      Mining Disclosures Iran’s vice president issued a directive Monday that states crypto miners in the nation will have to disclose their identities, the size of their mining farms and their mining equipment type with the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Trade within a month.

Market intel    Unique Addresses The seven-day moving average of the number of active ether addresses rose to 405,014 on Friday – a threshold not seen since May 2018, according to data provided by the blockchain analytics firm Glassnode. Active addresses are the number of unique addresses that are active in the network either as a sender or receiver. The increased ether activity could be associated with the explosive growth of Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, as well as the number of daily tether (USDT) transactions on the network.      ADA Gains Cardano’s ADA token has recorded a 170% return in the second quarter, propelling the crypto to its highest price level since June 2019. According to Daniel Ferraro, marketing director at blockchain intelligence firm IntoTheBlock, ADA’s impressive rally is the result of the excitement surrounding the “Shelley” upgrade, which would make Cardano 50 to 100 times more decentralized than other prominent blockchain networks, according to the company. Further, it will introduce an incentive scheme, or staking, designed to reach equilibrium around 1,000 stake pools.      Exchange Losses Trading volumes on ""top tier"" crypto spot exchanges fell by 36% in June, according to a report from London-based data provider CryptoCompare, potentially related to bitcoin’s recent low volatility. Similarly, crypto derivatives exchanges experienced a 35.7% drop in volume to $393 billion – the lowest monthly volumes since the start of 2020.    Opinion    The Pirate Bay Age of Money Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist and Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, writes about a pyramid scheme called Forsage that is eating up 25% of Ethereum’s bandwidth. Currently the most popular decentralized app, Forsage is just one example of the type of software that can take advantage of a permissionless system and cheat people out of their funds. “[W]e are in the Pirate Bay age of money: There is nothing to shut down, many will argue,” Sokolin writes, but “white hat hackers should come together to protect their users against naked pyramid schemes. If we don’t, there may never be real money in the system.

In a report Tuesday to the G-20 finance ministers and central bank governors, the international financial watchdog said regulators need to cooperate to make measures such as the Travel Rule more effective.  As such, the organization will work to develop an international framework for authorities to coordinate and share information about virtual asset service providers (VASPs).  As defined by FATF, a VASP is an open-ended term for crypto exchanges and peer-to-peer services as well as wallet providers and custodians. It can also include any business that trades or transacts in digital assets.  This would make the global regulation of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, in particular, more effective, FATF said.  The end goal would be the framework forming the base of a global network of supervisors for the crypto industry.  While details are currently sparse, an FATF spokesperson confirmed the watchdog would convene this autumn to discuss how to improve international cooperation.  FATF is also planning to make available a list of red flags indicating possible criminal activity to regulators at the same time.  Siân Jones, a senior partner at XReg Consulting, told CoinDesk the framework would help regulators get up to the same speed worldwide.  The report gives an overview of stablecoins, cryptocurrencies that attempt to offer price stability by being pegged to a reserve currency such as the U.S. dollar. FATF said it will be providing guidance for regulators at some future point.

42384022,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0EfT,1594135828,Crypto Tracer Chainalysis Raises $13M as It 'Doubles Down' on Government Ties,"Cryptocurrency intelligence firm Chainalysis said Tuesday it has raised $13 million in additional Series B financing from Ribbit Capital and Sound Ventures, bringing its total for the round to $49 million.    As part of the deal, the New York City-based company, which builds software that traces crypto transactions, is adding Ribbit Capital general partner Sigal Mandelker as an adviser. Mandelker is a former high-ranking Treasury Department official.  Chainalysis said the new investments will help it “grow and deepen its government relationships.” America’s federal agency alphabet soup frequently inks seven-figure software licensure deals with Chainalysis: The Internal Revenue Service and the Securities and Exchange Commission in the U.S. have together shelled out nearly $2 million in the past two months alone.  There are signs that Chainalysis’ tracing tools are growing in use beyond the U.S. government. Reactor, its flagship investigative product, has increased its revenue from new agency partners and foreign government customers 400% since 2019, according to the company.

42384013,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0B11,1594130402,Gelato Gives Developers a New ‘Money Lego’ Tool for DeFi Applications,"A new decentralized finance (DeFi) “money Lego” will allow app developers to make it possible for users to automate their transactions. Called Gelato, the protocol moved from alpha to a live and audited v1 on Ethereum’s mainnet on July 3.      And, according to a blog post shared early with CoinDesk, decentralized exchange (DEX) Gnosis will be the first major platform to integrate Gelato, allowing users to swap and withdraw tokens in a “seamless Uniswap-like UX.”      “It's a network that transacts on behalf of users or even dapps themselves, based on some conditions, like price or the collateralization ratio of a debt position,” Gelato co-founder Hilmar X. Orth told CoinDesk.      In short, the project gives developers simple infrastructural pieces to plug DeFi into decentralized applications (dapps).      Gnosis did not return requests for comment by press time.    Money Lego    Blockchains do not easily lend to trading without a little tech wizardry. They are slow and expensive to keep up, and users must bid against one another to record a transaction on the ledger.      Regardless of the difficulties, DeFi projects have attempted to build a new financial system on top of blockchains because of their other valuable features, namely their permissionless nature. The Ethereum blockchain has been a common choice for DeFi – quickly approaching $2 billion currently “staked,” or pledged, as collateral – for numerous reasons, mostly boiling down to Ethereum’s rich programming language which makes building projects easier.      See also: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained      Money Lego are tech stacks that allow different applications to fit (or be shoved) into other projects. For example, you can deposit ether (ETH) into MakerDAO, receive the stablecoin dai (DAI) and then lend it on Compound to a trader in order to earn the network’s governance token COMP.      That being said, the infrastructure for connecting these crypto-financial Lego is still being cast. Gelato is just one such project bringing composability to DeFi and dapps, Orth said.      “For example, we have a developer building Gelato into his smart contracts, which will withdraw funds from the wallet of his users to his smart contract every month, as an insurance premium payment. If the user then runs out of cash, the insurance will automatically be cancelled and the claims of the user [will] be burned,” Orth said.      Gelato has integrated with data provider Chainlink to supply gas rates on the Ethereum network as well, according to a July 3 blog. The pairing allows users to select gas prices based on current network congestion in order to lower settlement costs.      See also: Money Reimagined: Bitcoin and Ethereum Are a DeFi Double Act      Orth said the project’s code base will hopefully transfer by “the end of the year” to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for maintenance consisting of dapps using Gelato. Gelato will self-finance through network fees collected by the DAO, he said.      “It's just really a new way of building dapps that schedule asynchronous transactions right from their smart contracts,” Orth added.",POSITIVE,ETH | DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TRADING | DAI,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/07/07/gelato-gives-developers-a-new-money-lego-tool-for-defi-applications,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/60ab65b4b444e9602cec103acd24492de5b61f33-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384020,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0B8Z,1594127128,Weed Out the Soviet-Era Ponzi Scheme Eating Ethereum,"We have a beautiful Ethereum garden. In it we grow cash equivalents called stablecoins powering applications that run on open-source, programmable blockchains. It promises to be the new economy – free, permissionless and global. It saw more than $50 billion in transaction volume in June 2020 alone.      But there is a hungry weed growing underneath. In our beautiful public garden, there spreads corruption. Can we root out this plant? Can we turn the soil?    Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Fintech Blueprint newsletter.    The weed is called a pyramid scheme, and it always takes advantage of those who feed it. Take a look at the diagram below (from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission). After four levels of targets, the scheme needs just 7,000 people to be profitable to the swindlers. After the 10th level, it needs 60 million people. By the 13th level, you must consume 13 billion participants. There is never enough for the weed.      The weed can work on any technology, as long as it touches a human mind. You can spread it with words, on paper, by fax or in code. Here is how the weed looks when it's implemented in software: Thisacademic paper, published in January 2020, traces 184 software implementations of pyramid schemes operating on permissionless networks. There are more now.      Maybe you don't understand how bad this is for the garden. Maybe you think letting this grow and overtake our mutual work is freedom. The strongest survive, the weakest die.      See also: JP Koning - The $10B Stablecoin Industry Has a Fraud Problem It’s Not Addressing      With that mindset, we would have no delicate flowers or cultivated beauty. All we would have is a desert of dandelions and horseradish. In the world of money and cryptocurrency, there would be no real economic activity, no central bank digital currency, no crypto-native businesses, no new financial infrastructure and no technology platform shifts to blockchain. Just a loud grind of theft guzzling gas fees, crowding out productive activity from Ethereum forever.    The weed has a name    Let me introduce you to MMM, a pyramid scheme with roots in the former Soviet Union, which stole from nearly 10 million people during the 1990s. While decentralized finance and digital asset companies bend over backwards to be customer-centric and reform financial services (each in their own way), MMM is a pretender. It is a pretender that has stolen the language of the crypto economy to create a cancer in its body. It hides in the Paxos project and uses Ethereum for its 21st century machinations.      A personal aside: Growing up in the crumbling Soviet Union of the late-1980s, a series of TV commercials are etched into my memory.      You have to sympathize a little bit, and imagine a country that had no functioning economic system and a massive black market. As the Berlin Wall collapsed, so did the economic hallucination that was the centrally planned economy. TheChicago School of Economics group advisedthen-President Mikhail Gorbachev on a ""shock therapy"" approach to transition, leading to an unprecedented distribution of state assets (e.g., factories, buildings, natural resources) to people who could not tell the difference between a stock certificate and a stamp. Let's just say China did better with the gradual approach.      Into this context came the ads. They feature a Russian man, Lenya Golubkov, who ""invests"" his money with a ""securities cooperative"" called MMM. His fortunes soon improve. He is able to buy boots, then a coat for his wife, eventually touring America with his brother and starting a successful business. The securities he buys look like stock certificates, promising returns of 100% per month and more.    White hat hackers should come together to protect their users against naked pyramid schemes. If we don't, there may never be real money in the system.    You must understand that everything on TV carried authority in those times. Like movies from the U.S. that hinted at Western opulence and the promise of new wealth associated with liberalization, MMM was sold as a dream to regular people in a language they understood. I imagine in many poorer, less-educated parts of the world, such storytelling still works. As does this image of a voucher for a share in a pyramid scheme.      The man behind the scheme, Sergei Mavrodi, is a cartoon villain, dead at the age of 62 from a heart attack (who knows what that means in Russia now). He spent his life openly gaslighting regulators and politicians, briefly even becoming one to get immunity from prosecution. The people he was defrauding voted him in, but he ended up jailed anyway. Seemingly a brilliant mathematician and deeply cynical, Mavrodi wrapped the popular sentiments on the ground into a misleading trap for the unwary consumer.      It feels like a long time since the 1990s. But in terms of human nature it has been barely a blink. After Mavrodi got out of jail, MMM resurfaced in 2011, made its way to the internet and has now implanted itself into the body of cryptocurrency. Mavrodi is dead, but his scheme is the decentralized autonomous organization that nobody wanted, living on in the code forever. Like a tapeworm, it eats 10% of Ethereum's transactions and is responsible for 50% of the transfers for stablecoin Paxos, according to Coin Metrics.      The weed is not alone, it inspires others. Another pyramid called Forsage is eating up 25% of Ethereum's bandwidth, beating MMM at its parasitic game. Forsage is the decentralized app with the most users and volume, outperforming legitimate DeFi pioneers like Compound and Kyber Network. Other software versions of this same thing will proliferate and evolve as the smart contracts ecosystem of Ethereum matures. They prey on how easy it is to fool people and sell them a lie, and to undermine the infrastructure on which they grow.      Regulators in the Philippines have attempted to go after the pyramid scheme, but of course to no avail. It has no reach over Lado Okhotnikov, the developer of the code. And we are in the Pirate Bay age of money: There is nothing to shut down, many will argue. This is permissionless.    Root out the weeds    There is hard work ahead. Instead of yield farming arbitrage, the crypto community must root out these weeds. If we ever want broad adoption, it is unrealistic to say ""caveat emptor."" Most people are not able to probability-weigh payoffs and parse financial products for what is real and what is false.      Think for a moment of computer viruses. Just because computers can become infected and send your data and passwords to maleficent third parties doesn't mean that is likely to happen. Various shields, defenders and open software protect users from those seeking to troll and harm us. In the early-1990s, there were just 5,000 viruses transferred between computers. In 2020, research shows, there are now nearly a billion infections per year, acrossmillions of websites designed to trap and mislead people.      We still use computers. We still use the internet. It is safe to do so because the tools to protect people have been created and are as widely available as their adversaries.      In 30 years, I hope to say we still use Ethereum.

42384003,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0Aph,1594126800,"With Chat Privacy Under Threat in US, Firm Develops '100% User-Controlled' Messaging","As the U.S. moves to pass legislation that threatens to weaken end-to-end encryption, Unstoppable Domains is planning to give users full control over their chat data with a new decentralized protocol.    Called Dchat, the new protocol was born out of Mozilla's ""Fix the Internet"" incubator program, which invests in projects and people that design web technology with a focus on privacy and innovation.  Dchat functions by integrating cryptocurrency wallets and a peer-to-peer (P2P) storage network in order to securely store chat messages that are 100% controlled by users, the firm said Tuesday.  The tech is, in part, aimed at combating a rise in messaging privacy violations from government and organizations looking to surveil citizens or product users, such as those affected by Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018.  Unstoppable Domains co-founder Matthew Gould said Dchat would enable users to encrypt and store messages ""directly,"" unlike apps like Tinder or Facebook where a user's messages can be read by third parties.  Legislation known as the EarnIT Act that is passing through the U.S. Senate would, if it becomes law, force companies to provide back doors in end-to-end encrypted messaging systems in the U.S.  Unstoppable's Dchat protocol ""doesn't need to worry"" about the EarnIT Act because only users can see their messages, Gould claimed.  MyEtherWallet and imToken are already planning to launch their own apps using the Dchat protocol, which is expected to go live in the coming weeks, according to the firm.  Unstoppable Domains recently went into partnership with Protocol Labs, launching a decentralized censorship-resistant blogging platform on June 11.  The firm is backed by Draper Associates and Boost VC, and has received grants from the Ethereum and Zilliqa Foundations.

42384019,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0BB5,1594126293,First Mover: Even Bank of America Acknowledges China Winning Digital-Currency Race,"China's push to roll out a digital version of its yuan isn't likely to end the U.S. dollar's century-long reign as the dominant currency for international payments and central bank reserves. But it could make a dent.      That's the conclusion of foreign-exchange analysts at Bank of America, who argue a Chinese digital currency might be welcomed by regional trading partners as payments become increasingly electronic.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      China appears well ahead of the U.S. in developing a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, the Bank of America analysts wrote in a June 30 report. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who said last year the U.S. central bank had ""not identified potential material benefits"" of a general-purpose digital dollar, told Congress in June that officials are ""working hard"" on the issue.      Yet, the Agricultural Bank of China, one of the nation's four state-owned banking giants, is already trialing a test interface for the digital yuan, CoinDesk reported in April.      It goes without saying the spread of the coronavirus has inspired a newfound repugnance for germy cash.      ""China seems likely to have a clear first-mover advantage in its adoption of CBDCs, both in terms of timing and usage,"" the Bank of America analysts wrote. A digital yuan could increase the Chinese currency's use in international commerce ""even if it doesn't immediately disrupt the USD's dominant role in global finance.""      The advent of digital-asset technologies has combined with the coronavirus-induced economic crisis to raise nagging questions about whether the dollar's undisputed reign as the de facto global reserve currency might be due for a reckoning. The dollar accounts for some 62% of global central banks' foreign-exchange reserves.      As reported by First Mover on Monday, the German lender Deutsche Bank wrote in a report last week that a reelection victory by U.S. President Donald Trump could undermine the dollar's dominant role in the long term, given his willingness to spurn multilateral organizations including the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.      Such organizations have played a key role in the post-World-War-II order that helped enshrine the dollar's premier status. The U.S tender is closely watched in digital asset markets because it's the most common price denomination for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether as well as the backing for a fast-growing breed of digital tokens known as stablecoins.      ""The present-day experience is more of discord and less in favor of multilateralism,"" the analysts wrote. ""We are seeing more rivalry in areas such as trade and technological dominance.""      It's worth noting China closely manages the yuan's exchange rate against the dollar, so a digital version of the nation's currency – also known as the renminbi, or RMB – could trade similar to a dollar-linked stablecoin.      China has struggled to increase its currency's usage in international commerce. Since, 2016, when the yuan was incorporated into an IMF international reserve asset, the Chinese currency's penetration of global foreign-exchange reserves has doubled to a paltry 2%, as noted by the Bank of America analysts.      Some 63% of Chinese banks' cross-border claims are denominated in dollars, nearly identical to the proportion for U.S. lenders, the analysts wrote.      ""The internationalization of the RMB is happening, but the growth rate has been uneven and not as rapid as some may think,"" according to the report.      The Bank of America report comes as China's digital yuan is attracting growing attention from top monetary economists and cryptocurrency-industry executives.      The dollar's hegemony is also under question, following the foreign-exchange turmoil that has sent emerging-market currencies plunging this year, saddling the world's poorest countries with rising costs for imported consumer goods and elevated interest payments on international debt. Many bitcoin investors say the Federal Reserve's roughly $3 trillion of money injections this year – with likely more to come – could end up debasing the dollar's purchasing power.      Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, which backs the dollar-linked stablecoin USDC, said on a podcast last week that China's development of a digital currency has effectively ""created a model where a household, a firm, a nation state can kind of directly transact and settle with China over the internet,"" effectively bypassing payment systems in the U.S. sphere of economic influence.      Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, a guest on the podcast, said he doubted China would make it the digital yuan flexible enough to allow its citizens to freely move wealth and resources out of the country.      “And I think a system that is so restricted that it isn’t possible to do that isn’t going to be much of a global digital currency,” he said.      The Bank of America analysts noted that several Asian countries, including Thailand, Singapore and South Korea are assessing their own digital currencies, which might become integrated with yuan-based payment systems, ""especially if it entails significantly lower transaction costs and real-time transfers.""      ""Ultimately, this is likely to be the actual (and more realistic) objective for China than a serious attempt to displace the USD's status as the global reserve currency,"" the analysts wrote.      It might be that the only serious threats to the dollar's reign would come from within the U.S.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,250 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,374 | 24-Hr Low: $9,192      Trend: Bitcoin is feeling the pull of gravity at press time, having faced rejection at key technical hurdle early on Tuesday.      After prices failed to cut through the 50-day moving average hurdle at $9,385 during the Asian trading hours, the cryptocurrency is now trading at $9,250, representing a 1% decline on the day.      The pullback from the 50-day MA hurdle has neutralized the immediate bullish view put forward by Monday’s 3% gain.      Bitcoin jumped to $9,350 yesterday, confirming an upside break of the narrow trading range of $8,830–$9,300 seen in the nine days to July 5. In addition, Monday’s price gains confirmed signals of potential gains from the repeated dip demand below $9,000 seen over the past two weeks.      A move above the 50-day MA of $8,385 would revive the bullish bias signaled by Monday’s 3% rally and open the doors to $10,000.      On the downside, the weekly opening price of $9,077 is the level to defend for the bulls. A violation there could yield a quick drop to the 50-week MA at $8,632, with the 5- and 10-week MAs having produced a bearish crossover, the first since early March.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/07/first-mover-even-bank-of-america-acknowledges-china-winning-digital-currency-race,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8f2fa46ea36b66e5acf2b694b08aaf10bc75beb2-1500x964.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384018,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0B9p,1594124146,Ethereum Activity Metric Hits Highest Level in 2 Years,"Levels of activity on Ethereum have peaked to their highest in two years, going by one metric.      The seven-day moving average of the number of active ether addresses rose to 405,014 on Friday – a threshold not seen since May 2018, according to data provided by the blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.      Active addresses are the number of unique addresses that are active in the network either as a sender or receiver. Glassnode takes into account only those addresses that were active in successful transactions.      As of Monday, the seven-day average was down slightly to 390,162. That’s still 115% growth from the low of 180,750 seen on Jan. 30.      The increased ether activity could be associated with the explosive growth of Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, as well as the number of daily tether (USDT) transactions on the network.      At press time, about 3.1 million ether were locked in various DeFi applications, according to data source defipulse.com. Meanwhile, the number of daily USDT – the most used stablecoin – transactions on ether has increased by over 400% this year, as per CoinMetrics.      Also read: DeFi’s ‘Agricultural Revolution’ Has Ethereum Users Turning to Decentralized Exchanges      The heightened demand for ether from such use cases is expected by many to fuel a major bull run. So far, however, the cryptocurrency has struggled to decouple from bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value.      Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is moving pretty much in tandem with bitcoin. The ether-bitcoin one-year correlation has risen to 89%, the highest on record, according to crypto derivatives research firm Skew.      Some observers would argue that address growth is not a reliable indicator of adoption, as a single user can own multiple addresses. Crypto exchanges also store coins belonging to traders in multiple addresses.      While that's true, ether’s active addresses metric is more reliable compared to that of bitcoin. “Active addresses are inflated on bitcoin because of the UTXO model,” tweeted to Anthony Sassano, SetProtocol product marketing manager and co-founder of EthHub, an open-source initiative founded by the Ethereum community.      UTXO stands for unspent transaction output. Under the UTXO model, bitcoin users have to use new addresses with each transaction. Meanwhile, Ethereum uses an accounts model, under which addresses get reused, as noted by Sassano.      Bitcoin’s daily active addresses recently rose to the highest level since December 2017, suggesting scope for a price rally to $12,000, according to Bloomberg analysts.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $9,270, representing a 0.8% drop on the day and ether is trading at $238, down 1.7%, according to CoinDesk data.    View    Ether jumped 6% on Monday to print its biggest single-day gain since June 22. However, a trendline falling from June 2 and June 24 highs is still intact.      If network activity is a guide, the cryptocurrency could soon breach the trendline resistance, currently at $246. That would signal a continuation of the rally from March lows below $100 and expose $289 (Feb. 15 high).

Trading volumes on ""top tier"" spot exchanges fell by 36% in June, according to a report from London-based data provider CryptoCompare.  Similarly, crypto derivatives exchanges experienced a 35.7% drop in volume to $393 billion, the lowest monthly volumes since the start of 2020.  Bitcoin's ATR range – a volatility metric – has nearly halved since the start of June. At press time, it was just 20 points above its 2020 low.  CryptoCompare CEO Charles Hayter said June's spot prices had been flat compared to previous months and the lack of price volatility likely explained the drop in trade volumes.  In theory, exchange volumes could continue tracking downwards should volatility remain at low levels, he said.  Volumes across the entire crypto spot market – both ""top tier"" and ""lower tier"" exchanges – fell nearly 50% in June, meaning the market share for crypto derivatives has increased 5% to 37%.

42384006,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0Auj,1594105200,Mercedes Maker Daimler Tests Blockchain for Supply-Chain Data Sharing,"Ocean Protocol, a blockchain-based data-sharing platform, has completed a proof-of-concept (PoC) with Daimler, showing how the Mercedes-Benz maker can begin monetizing data streams within the company and across its supply chains.      Announced Tuesday, the Singapore-based Ocean collaborated with Daimler AG to explore the decentralized sharing of internal sales and financial data among the multinational’s production hubs, and externally between some of its supply chain procurement partners.      The project, which involved Daimler’s Stuttgart headquarters and its Singapore manufacturing hub, lets large enterprises feel more comfortable about sharing data and extracting insights from hitherto undiscovered datasets, while keeping tabs on who’s looking at what.      “We believe in the power of blockchain to unlock the value of data in a decentralized way,” Daimler technology VP Hartmut Mueller said in a statement. “On our journey towards a data-driven company this collaboration with Ocean protocol enables us to build a secure enterprise B2B data marketplace to monetize and put data to work.”    MercedesChain    Following the example of big tech, enterprises have realized data is the most valuable naturally occurring resource on the planet. Carmakers like Daimler, General Motors and BMW have been at the forefront when it comes to test-driving blockchain technology, exploring everything from vehicle identity to managing data from self-driving cars.      Read more: GM, BMW Back Blockchain Data Sharing for Self-Driving Cars      Ocean Protocol founder Bruce Pon, who previously spent five years working in Daimler’s IT department, said a company of that size can spend around $300 million a year simply trying to harmonize software, security measures and various types of administration – costs that a transparent means of data sharing and reconciliation could slash.      “We have proved that internal and external data sharing works,” Pon said in an interview with CoinDesk. “Daimler’s IT departments can handle it and the business wants it. Blockchain can turn the company’s IT system from a cost center into a profit center.”      Examples of internal data-sharing optimized using the Ocean blockchain include sales and finance data, which could change dramatically due to events such as COVID-19, said Pon. In terms of external data, the PoC looked at the procurement of parts and equipment across various jurisdictions, he said.    Beyond Proofs-of-Concept    Back in 2016 and 2017, the enterprise blockchain world suffered from a chronic case of PoC fatigue, following an overbearance of hype around the technology. Pon said this time is different, however.      “Sure, there was ‘PoC-itis’ that happened back in 2017; we did about 50 of them, including a couple with Daimler,” he said. “At that stage, everybody was just learning. But today people know how blockchain works, and we are looking now at how to deploy this system, as the ability to buy and sell data using Ocean already exists.”      Read more: Ocean Tries New Token Sale After CoinList Offering Misses Target      As well as the transparency and the improved reconciliation of data across multiple systems, Ocean’s privacy-preserving secret sauce uses so-called “federated machine learning.” This type of machine learning is built without direct access to training data, allowing that data to remain in its original location, such as behind a company’s firewalls.      Ocean co-founder Trent McConaghy explained that Ocean takes centralized federated learning, which is popular with the likes of Google, and gives it a big dose of decentralization.    Car 2.0    Looking ahead, carmakers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) understand the wealth of data at their fingertips and the race to extract value from it, which could include sensor data generated by the car itself, as well as data consumed within the car by passengers.      “The decentralized data marketplace is an interesting proposition and gives us an exciting opportunity for aggregation of data with a clear compensation approach,” Frank Schur, a technology manager at Daimler’s Singapore subsidiary, said in a statement. “Using Ocean Protocol, we want to implement this in a secure and transparent way.”      Pon said the Ocean team has done “a lot of brainstorming with automakers” on this subject. He predicts the first data-market-based subsidies might occur with trucking companies or delivery service vehicles.      “There are ways to securitize a whole data stream going forward, like all the DHL drivers in the city of Los Angeles, for instance,” Pon said. “It’s a technology that can put the automaker on an even footing with the Googles and Bloombergs of the world.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/07/mercedes-maker-daimler-tests-blockchain-for-supply-chain-data-sharing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a71ae73416f83f8667a2ed332d2c2af761506de5-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
