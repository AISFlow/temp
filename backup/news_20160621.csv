42378772,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lj6D,1466552491,7 Financial Firms to Build Post-Trade Blockchain for Small Businesses,"Seven financial institutions have combined forces to explore how blockchain tech could help lower the costs of providing post-trade settlement services to small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).  BNP Paribas Securities Services, Caisse des Dépôts, Euroclear, Euronext, S2iEM, Société Générale and Paris EUROPLACE announced today they have signed a memorandum of understanding to develop the initiative. By lowering the costs of post-trade services, the group says SMEs could better access to financing through the capital markets.  The partnership will also consider launching an independent company to design, develop and deploy blockchain technology to other international post-trade partners.  In recent months, financial institutions from all over the world have been partnering and joining consortiums to develop blockchain infrastructure for various areas of the banking system. However, activity has also been strong in France, where 11 financial services firms announced a similar partnership in December to evaluate the ethical and regulatory implications of the technology.  The latest move aligns with the thinking that for permissioned blockchains to succeed, institutions that have traditionally been competitors will have to collaborate.  ""By pooling our strengths in this ground-breaking area, we are focusing on new solutions that will give small and mid-sized companies – key actors for growth in Europe – easier access to the financing they need,” a joint statement issued by the group reads.  The group cited the speed of execution, low cost and security that blockchain could provide as driving factors behind the initiative.

42378771,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lj8j,1466541196,Bitcoin Price Plunges Below $700 As Market Outlook Weakens,"The price of bitcoin fell below $700 on 21st June, dropping more than 10% in an aggressive correction to recent gains.  The decline came just a day after the price surpassed $780, rising to a fresh 28-month high, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures reveal. But while this could be viewed as a positive for the digital currency, investors didn't quite see it the same way.  The currency appeared ""slightly overbought"" after reaching the “high 700s,” according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of bitcoin leverage trading platform BitMEX.  To some market observers, the trading outage at Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Bitfinex, one of the market's largest exchanges, was seen as the contributing factor that pushed the currency’s decline past $700.  BPI data shows that when the Bitfinex website announced the outage at roughly 9:30 UTC, the digital currency was down approximately 3% for the day. But, by 13:45 UTC, the digital currency had fallen to $649.47, more than 10% below the day’s opening price.  Still, while the outage at a high-profile exchange likely contributed to the day's developments, others described a more complex situation in which key price indicators proved vulnerable to changes in perception.  Shifting indicators  One such change came in the form of a change in the outlook for the ""Brexit"", the nickname for the ongoing debate over whether the UK should succeed from the European Union.  According to a poll conducted by market research firm Survation on 17th and 18th June, 45% of British voters want their nation to stay in the EU, while 42% want it to leave, findings that signified that sentiment seems to have shifted in favor of staying in the EU.  The drop in the number of respondents favoring a Brexit helped more traditional investments see a ""relief rally,"" Hayes told CoinDesk.  While he maintained that bitcoin prices have benefited lately from heightened fears about the “global macroeconomic outlook,” these concerns may have softened somewhat now that the Brexit appears less likely.  Petar Zivkovski, director of operations for bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, also spoke to the Brexit and its impact on bitcoin.  He emphasized that the possibility of the UK leaving the EU was “on the table” up until recently, but that, with this event looking increasingly unlikely, bitcoin's ability to serve as a safe asset would decline.  Zivkovski told CoinDesk:  ""The UK will probably remain in the EU, hence strengthening fiat and weakening bitcoin's [use] case of escaping capital controls.""  DAO confusion  The recent compromise of customer funds associated with the distributed autonomous organization The DAO may also be affecting bitcoin prices, according to Chris Burniske, analyst and blockchain products lead at investment management firm ARK Invest.  While The DAO is built on ethereum, an alternative blockchain platform, Burniske said that he has received correspondences from investors who confused issues with the DAO as representing a ""weakness in bitcoin's underlying technology"".  ""People who are not well versed in Ethereum, bitcoin and blockchain technology can get easily confused and become gun-shy by bad news,"" he said, adding:  ""And there is plenty of bad news surrounding The DAO at the moment.”  At press time, this situation was still evolving, with customers funds being moved in an apparent rescue attempt initiated by developers.  Bitfinex trading outage  Once bitcoin’s price began falling sharply, this helped fuel a “powerful long squeeze"" that drove prices down further, said Zivkovski. As a result, he posited that ""a snowball effect ensued"".  Max Boonen, founder of market maker B2C2 Ltd, also weighed in on bitcoin’s sharp drop, stating that the outage affected traders who held short and long positions.  ""The lower the price went after the outage, the larger the margin calls on Bitfinex when they would reopen,” he explained.  Still, after suffering these declines, bitcoin prices are in good shape to recover, Whaleclub data suggested. Whaleclub’s long-short ratio was 1.5:1 at the time of report, pointing to bullishness, and short interest had failed to become significant, Zivkovski said.  ""Most traders are opting to ‘buy the dip’ and are reopening long positions at these lower prices, albeit less confidently,"" he said.  Such an opinion was also echoed by investor Vinny Lingham, who predicted this decline in prices would not persist.  Lingham told CoinDesk:  ""The market should rebound pretty quickly.""  Charles L.

42378758,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lir7,1466536471,Ethereum Developers Launch White Hat Counter-Attack on The DAO,"Reports are emerging that members of the ethereum development community are moving funds from The DAO in attempt to stifle a new alleged attack.  Developer Alex Van de Sande, lead designer for the Ethereum Foundation, took to Twitter to announce the move, which came shortly after word emerged on social media that more funds were being siphoned from contracts associated with The DAO. He said that the action is a response to a new exploitation of The DAO’s smart contract code, which comes days after millions of dollars worth of ether were taken from contracts associated with project.  The address being used by Ethereum's developers can be found here, and at press time, it had amassed more than 4m ethers, worth approximately $48m.  However, funds from The DAO have also been sent to this address, though whether it is tied to the alleged attack or is involved with the ethereum developer efforts is unclear. At the time of this writing, that address had amassed more than $140k worth of ethers.  A third address has also amassed funds from The DAO, collecting roughly $820,000 at press time.  The move to drain the DAO comes amid continued debate among ethereum community members about whether to fork the network in an attempt to thwart those behind last week's attack.  Van de Sande did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42378769,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lj4x,1466534472,Coinbase Co-Founder Cautions Against Ethereum Hard Fork,"Digital currency exchange operator Coinbase is weighing in on the ongoing crisis with The DAO, the distributed autonomous organization (DAO) that recently saw millions in customer funds seized by an unknown individual or individuals through a code exploitation.  In statements to CoinDesk, Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam said that he would prefer that ethereum’s developers avoid making changes to the blockchain platform’s code that would find them changing protocol rules to rescue customer funds. The comments are notable given Coinbase’s vocal support for the ethereum platform and ether, the native digital currency it added to its GDAX exchange in May.    In remarks, Ehrsam reiterated his past public statements on the issue, but cautioned that the ethereum platform is still in its early stages, and that as such, The DAO should be viewed as both a learning experience and a ""reality check"".    Ehrsam told CoinDesk:  ""We should learn to live with those mistakes because people will write poor smart contracts in the future and we can't fork each time.""  In spite of the recent turmoil, Ehrsam said that his view of the strength of the ethereum development community and ether market remains unchanged.    ""It shows that it's hard to write secure smart contracts,"" he said.    The comments come amid a larger debate in the ethereum community on the actions that should be taken to protect customer investments now that The DAO has been compromised.  Options include either a hard or soft fork, the latter of which would find the ethereum protocol being updated so that any spending from a contract associated with The DAO would be deemed invalid.  Alternatively, the development community could pursue a hard fork that would potentially reverse actions taken by the attacker. However, this would come at the cost of the developers over-exercising what some believe is their authority to implement changes on a decentralized network.

42378765,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lj1B,1466527474,Finnish City Awarded €2.4 Million to Test Blockchain-Powered Shipping,"An economic development firm owned by the city of Kouvola in Finland has received €2.4m to help pay for a project designed to streamline the supply chain using blockchain.  To be dispersed over a three-year period, the money from Kouvola Innovation will be used in part to connect various enterprise resource planning (ERP) tools used by the trucking industry, warehousing industry and freight operating industry to manage their supply chains.  While talk of streamlining supply chains by creating a single immutable record of products is increasingly common, this effort is different in that it could find smart contracts being built into shipping containers themselves.  Mika Lammi, head of internet of things business development at Kouvola, told CoinDesk:  ""Another aspect of the project is to use the blockchain’s trust and data integrity properties – smart contracts in short – and give cargo containers limited decision making authority in regards to their route planning, tendering for transport contracts and such.""  Called SmartLog, the project was funded earlier this month by the European Union INTERREG Central Baltic, which is tasked to disperse €115m from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Union organization dedicated to funding cross-border cooperative projects between Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Sweden.  Global applications  The effort is part of a $9.9bn global supply chain software industry that has become a target of increasing innovation by members of the blockchain community.  In February, Lammi gave a joint presentation with IBM’s chief architect of Internet of Things security, Tim Hahn, about how blockchain technology can be used to streamline Finland’s transportation industry as it connects to other areas in the region.  According to a lecture document, Kouvola is a key logistical destination for connecting the EU, Russia and Asia, hosting 200 logistics companies in the city alone and 500 logistics companies in the surrounding Kymenlaakso region.  Beginning in September, a proof-of-concept for the SmartLog project will begin development, designed to create a global blockchain platform for the logistics industry and give containers the ability to “dynamically” organize their own routes.  Elsewhere around the world, Mountain View-based Skuchain has raised money from Aminon, FBS Capital and Digital Currency Group to simplify the supply chain finance using blockchain technology. London-based Provenance has raised a seed round to streamline the supply chain of grocery stores using smartphones to scan barcodes.  IBM and Hyplerledger  In February, Kouvolo Innovation was one of the initial members of IBM's blockchain-as-a-service for developers when it was first revealed along with other early users including the London Stock Exchange.  The city government organization participated in IBM’s Partnership Beta Program, giving feedback to a beta version of its blockchain platform, according to Lammi.  When SmartLog is complete, Lammi expects it will ""most likely"" run ""using the Hyperledger version of the blockchain"".  Lammi told CoinDesk:  ""I can only say that the IBM engineering guys have worked out some serious shit, the tech is extremely impressive.""

42378761,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7litd,1466523651,Euroclear to Develop Blockchain Gold Settlement System,"Clearing and settlement services firm Euroclear has announced its first partnership with a blockchain industry business.  Belgium-based Euroclear revealed today it would partner with bitcoin exchange and blockchain services provider itBit to develop a system for settling gold trades. The project is aimed at reducing risk and increasing asset mobility and liquidity in the London gold market, and will find the two firms working in tandem to develop a ""next-generation settlement service"" that could be launched as soon as next year.  As part of the deal, Euroclear will act as the regulated entity for the planned product, while itBit will serve as a technology provider.  In interview, Euroclear product strategy and innovation lead Angus Scott described the effort as one of the first to seek to settle real assets using blockchain tech. However, he said that the project was attractive to Euroclear due to the fact it is in line with the company’s broader goal of pursuing efficiency.  Scott told CoinDesk:  “It’s a very genuine product. It’s one we’d be looking at irrespective of blockchain. Essentially we’ll take a lot of transactional friction out, create a common data set. The hypothesis we’re testing is that this is generally more efficient.”  Scott went on to discuss the wider emphasis that UK regulators have put on supporting improvements to the country’s financial infrastructure, which he said had a positive impact on Euroclear’s decision to move forward on the proposal.  He further pointed to the steps the company has taken to research and investigate the opportunities blockchain could bring, a process he said ended with the conclusion that the technology could be ""potentially fundamental"" to Euroclear’s business.  Scott acknowledged that the project is an ambitious one, but said that Euroclear felt itBit was the best partner given what he called the company’s competency and experience in capital markets.  Scott concluded:  ""It’s never easy to bring market infrastructure change. You have to get the regulation right, the legal structure right, and you have to get people to move.""

42378774,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7ljBF,1466521190,Post-Trade Blockchain Startup in Limbo After Raising $10 Million,"Sweden-based blockchain startup Cryex is pushing back against reports it is seeking capital to stay afloat, instead pinning its lack of outward momentum and low earnings on a slow regulatory environment.  Rising to prominence in May 2015 with $10m in funding, Cryex was among the first startups to explore blockchain technology in post-trade, a proposition that attracted investors including White Star Capital and Northzone Ventures. In the time since, post-trade has become one of the hottest use cases for blockchain, with Goldman Sachs projecting it could save the industry billions annually in the derivatives and equities markets alone.  Cryex  , though, hasn’t benefited from the trend in its bid to launch a central counterparty clearing (CCP) organization based on blockchain technology. Reports, however, differ on the exact reasons for the company’s struggles.  Sweden-based tech news source Breakit, for example, reported late last month that from September 2014 to December 2015, the company spent 43m SEK (or bout $5.9m) while earning just 9.5m SEK (or $1.1m) in revenue. The news source also highlighted the exodus of the company’s original leadership, with co-founders Scott Miller, Christian Merheim and Klas Hessleman all departing over the last year.  While this would seem to paint a bleak picture of the company’s progress, Cryex CEO Lotta Eek said in interview that such reports were misleading, and that the company is close to securing a license to launch its solution from the Swedish Finansinspektionen (SFSA), the country's financial supervisory authority.  Eek told CoinDesk:  ""We went full speed ahead and tried, even though we knew that a reality check may show we wouldn’t get the license with cryptocurrency. We ran into that reality, and still hold onto it very strongly.""  Eek described the attempt to become a CCP as ambitious given that just 16 such entities are now allowed to offer services in the European Union, according to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). Further, she said the cost of such an effort shouldn’t be compared to other startups.  ""The average cost for a project like this, the closest you can get is what Nasdaq has done launching a marketplace and clearinghouse,"" she said.  Eek said that Cryex submitted its licensing application in April 2015, and that the 10-person company is now seeking to raise a Series B funding round (Breakit indicated it will raise $15m and a bridge loan) that would help it continue to finance its solution.  Pivot to FX  As for how this path forward would look, it would more immediately find Cryex prioritizing its non-blockchain services, according to Eek.  Eek suggested that, by design, the company has two versions of its platform, one that is more actionable as it does not rely on blockchain.  ""Our marketplace has two parts. One is for FX, the other is for FX and crypto. Same thing for the clearing, we do have two parallel environments. One for FX projects and one for crypto in relation to FX,"" Eek said.  More broadly, Eek said that the firm has perhaps been held back by its use of a token-based blockchain system at a time when many banks are still unsure of whether they can handle so-called digital assets, or unique pieces of code that run on a distributed ledger.  Eek said that Cryex had considered offering a more ""ledger-based solution"", in which information is shared but no tokens are exchanged, and she lauded startups in this part of the space including SETL and Chainalysis as examples of how post-trade could be made more efficient.  Still, she said the company sees these solutions as short-sighted given the potential value digitized assets could bring to capital markets.  ""We also still have an interest in the cryptocurrency space, which as I understand it, is quite odd. We strongly believe the advantages of cryptocurrencies in value transfer are self-evident,"" she said. ""When that will happen, we don’t know, but we will follow.""  Path ahead  As for when the company would launch blockchain services, Eek was optimistic that Cryex could have its filing approved by mid-September of this year.  Still, Eek said that Cryex could be competitive even with its FX services, due to the comprehensive bid and ask information it will show in its order-driven market.  ""That’s the first core value proposition. There’s really only one player in the market that will do this,"" Eek said, adding:  ""Cryex has been a huge project. Our clearing organization is more than equivalent of current places out there.""  From there, Eek said Cryex plans to move into OTC derivatives as its proof-of-concept for a cryptocurrency settlement system would await regulatory approval.

42378773,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lj9z,1466510325,What We Can Learn From The DAO,"William Mougayar is the author of ""The Business Blockchain"", and a board Advisor to the Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit that oversees the protocol's development.  In this opinion piece, Mougayar offers his thoughts on the recent crisis at The DAO, the largest and most visible project launched on the ethereum platform to date.  I have been asked about ""The DAO” numerous times since its launch, and was planning to make my views known. But the recent situation precipitated this post, and as a result, this will include analysis, lessons and recommendations for the future.  Over the past month, I have given two public warnings about The DAO, primarily that the amount of money it raised was too high. Second, I felt that the complexity of its governance and sole dependence on smart contracts were a ticking bomb. I thought there was too much on the table all at once.  I strongly believed that the same experimentation benefits could have been achieved with much lower risk, while preserving a similar diversity in user participation.  You don't need $150m+ to initiate an experiment in autonomously funded and operated organizations based on smart contract governance with unproven code and inexperienced managers. In my opinion, $10m to 15m would have sufficed, and yielded the same benefits and lessons, even if it might have gathered fewer headlines and less public attention.  When I heard rumblings about the DAO from Slock.it, I had just finished writing my book, The Business Blockchain that included a section on DAOs, with the header ""The DAOs are coming"" (p. 111).  However, that passage in the book was based on my earlier research and analysis, and my own interpretation of a DAO framework to ensure sound operations. It had none of the hype and overly optimistic cheering for the DAO model that we later saw as envisioned by its Slock.it founders.  On 1st May, as The DAO funding started beating records, it was explained to me that the project was an experiment meant to distribute funds to other ethereum projects, and I thought it was a noble goal if it was tightly managed with clear and strict guidelines. I wished them well, and considered investing, just to be part of the experiment, but didn’t end up doing it.  I decided to remain an outside spectator because I didn’t believe that their implementation as envisioned was sound enough.  Worry sets in  In mid May, as the DAO funding numbers swelled to new heights, I became worried. On 18th May, at the OuiShare conference in Paris, I specifically warned that the DAO experiment may be too big and too risky.  Specifically, I saidhttp://www.tubechop.com/watch/8117951:  ""I would caution about not wanting to run too quickly and assuming we can have DAO’s from the get go. It takes practice, it takes some tests. I’d like to see testing these DAOs with small dollar values, not with millions of dollars where the losses could have some severe repercussions on the whole system.""  As recently as a few days before the hack, I freely volunteered my services to The DAO in the hope of influencing them to improve their governance and management approach. The response was: ""Thanks, but it’s moving forward fine on its own.""  They were obviously dogmatic on implementing their auto-pilot mission. Then, 17th June happened, and we know where we are today.  Lessons and implications  For background, you can read this FAQ written by the Ethereum Foundation on Reddit.  There hasn’t been a shortage of analysis and opinion pieces, although I was more drawn to the ones providing solutions and constructive paths forward, such as those written by ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin's analysis; Cornell professor Emin Gun Sirer; or Union Square Ventures partner Albert Wenger. I also enjoyed Andreas Antonopoulos' Let's Talk Bitcoin marathon Hangout on that topic, here, and this Bloomberg analysis.  I kicked off some of my thoughts on Twitter with this:  There are different ways to see what the perpetrator did. Behind the “hack”, there is also a case of law, ethics, governance, theft, terrorism, bribery and blackmail. If I were a judge issuing a ruling, I would hold the hacker accountable on multiple charges.  This isn’t the time to get philosophically cute or assert that the hacker didn’t do anything wrong because they ran a valid smart contract using a feature that “allowed” the movement of funds to a child DAO. We shouldn’t buy that argument. The hacker is treating the 3.6m ETH as a selfish reward for doing nothing except the exploit itself.  In their alleged ""open letter"", the hacker or hackers did not show an interest in using the funds according to the mission and intent of The DAO, which is to fund projects and companies. The child DAO feature is a means to an end. That end is to approve project proposals and disburse funds to bona fide companies via the DAO. For the hacker, the end was to keep the funds, and not fund companies, therefore they are guilty of theft.  The hacker's intent was clearly to harm and cause damages to The DAO and ethereum, as well as put a black mark of confidence against the field of crypto technologies.  Therefore, they are rogue and unlawful actors. To add insult to injury, the hackers offered to fund miners that don’t follow the fork, which is the equivalent of bribery and blackmail. So far, the perpetrator or perpetrators don’t pass any ""good intentions"" test. They are full of bad intentions.  In my opinion, this is crypto-terrorism. We know what we do with terrorists. They deserve no sympathy and no reprieve. Extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures, and I’m hopeful that the community will do the right thing.  Did the hackers indirectly cause any good by making us aware of the inherent risks of smart contracts and the malformation of The DAO? Yes, perhaps. But I wouldn’t give them an award for that. These flaws were already known as Vitalik Buterin explained in his blog post, and they were being worked on, gradually. There was no need for a spectacular exercise of zealotry to point out the weaknesses of the DAO and its suite of governance smart contracts.  If the hackers had an ounce of goodness in them, and wanted to ethically expose the flaw in the contract code, they could have ended their exploit by just proving it, and promptly returned the ether, just as an ethical hacker would. There is nothing ethical about this hacker or team of hackers.  Starting small  All told, there are several lessons we can learn from.  Running a company’s governance on the principles of DAOs is similar to setting a car on autonomous driving. It is a big responsibility requiring tests to avoid accidents. Possibly ethereum might be as close to DAOs as Tesla is to giving us autonomously driven cars, but we are not there yet.  We need the training guide first, and we might need to start semi-autonomously, just like Tesla drivers can take their hands off the wheel momentarily to observe and learn how the car behaves on the freeway, and just like we can summon the car out the garage, or let it park itself. These are two relatively harmless procedures, even if they fail.  Simplicity trumps complexity. The DAO, as constructed was complicated and over-engineered. The DAOhub website was gradually updated throughout the fundraising cycle, and ended up being quite polished. Yet, the more I read, the less I understood, and the more questions I had.  If it's complicated, it's bad news. The language was semi-legal, semi-technical, semi-contractual, non-committal and technical all at once. It was confusing, subject to interpretation, yet scored high on the marketing sizzle scale.  DAO governance is not easy. The DAO had two intertwined governance challenges on their hands, not just one. It had to deal with its own governance, and it had to figure out the ensuing decentralized governance of its operations concerning the implementation of the smart contracts, and the relationship with the recipient companies and its voting members.  This created an increased complexity that perhaps was not originally envisioned by the DAO founders.  Autonomy comes with a lot of responsibility. A smart contract that contains money is not a piñata. It is a big responsibility. We need to be very careful when smart contracts carry large sums of economic value.  Smart contracts are not a hammer. To some crypto enthusiasts, smart contracts are like a hammer. They want to apply them for everything, and The DAO was the epitome of that belief. But not everything is a nail. Maybe it’s too early for smart contracts to rule the world.  Security first. The larger the amounts of money at stake, the higher the security requirements. Security is required before deployment, not in mid-flight. Blockchains undergo obligatory ""testnet"" phases with blank cryptocurrency. Why not this DAO? There was too much assembly in the air.  Beyond technology  Technologists alone are not enough.  You can’t make up management and operations experience if you haven't been part of a properly run organization. Involving a number of non-technical people with business experience will go a long way in avoiding common errors and trivial issues.  Don’t concoct a DAO if you haven’t had operational experience, because you will run into blind spots. It takes more than curators to ensure a properly run DAO.  Effective faceless leadership is still science fiction. Are we ready to trust faceless leadership? The only faceless leadership that we know of today is of the evil kind: ISIS/ISIL and Al-Qaeda. True that Satoshi Nakamoto was a faceless leader, but she/he/they was/were there present at least until leadership responsibilities were decentralized.  Good intentions don’t count. In the presence of evil or incompetence, sadly enough, good intentions will be trumped.  A smart contract with money is not like any piece of code. You can’t just code up a smart contract just because you can code a few lines of Java or Solidity. Smart contracts that carry monetary value should be tighter than tight. It is about trust after all, right? The decentralized protocols are promising a better version of trust where we trust the machines more than incumbent trust intermediaries.  Bugs are very costly, figuratively and explicitly. Code-based governance is still immature. We are still at the baby steps levels.  Let’s not overshoot too quickly what it can do, and let’s start with smaller experiments. I wrote about ""What It Takes to Succeed as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization"" in February 2015, 16 months ago; and much of it still applies today. I updated these thoughts in my book. Pure DAO is tough.  Why not start with hybrid versions? Pure DAOs need guidance and business model iterations. We can’t assume they will be rightly assembled from the start.  Implications and recommendations  Going forward, what are some ideas for a better future pertaining to DAOs, smart contracts and decentralization as a whole?  This isn’t an exhaustive list, and I’m sure that others will be adding excellent ideas, but this is my starting point:  Institute classes of smart contracts. Vitalik Buterin has written a comprehensive review of smart contract security problems and potential solutions, but let’s hope we’re not whacking a mole.  We could identify the risk profile of smart contracts related to their economic linkages, just to be sure we limit the potential damage resulting from malfunction. Kind of like movie ratings.  Institute a self-imposed limit on any contract up to a maximum of $10M. This would then gradually increase it after we are sure that no flaws occurred, like the speed limit as long as no accidents happened for a while. I envision this self-imposed limit to be a multi-year process.  Conduct more research and studies on DAOs and their governance. DAOs are still a very immature field. We need to apply the research in reasonable doses within benign sandboxes, then collectively learn and continue to innovate accordingly.  Always think of the trilogy of blockchain applications: business, technology and legal. It is not just about designing better smart contracts. This trilogy approach will ensure that no stones are left unturned while implementing decentralized technologies.  Invest in smart contract engineering science. This new field has been bust open, pushed by ethereum, and the more we get into it, the more we seem to find out there is something left to learn in the field of proper implementations.  Keep in mind the second trilogy of success: vision, code and humans. These three parts need to come together with clarity, precision, quality and competency.  Don’t ignore jurisdictional considerations. Choose and specify the laws and jurisdictions that you will be bound by. We still live by the rule of government law. Exclusively choosing the laws of cryptoland is the equivalent to choosing jungle and Darwinian laws at best.  You will be subject to shenanigans like The DAO hacker who will test the limits of your legitimacy.  Getting Smarter  Did the DAO have to end this way? No. For the DAO, this was an unfortunate way to “fold”. It happened before it could even learn the real lessons we were hoping to learn about decentralized governance models.  What we learned, we already knew: that you can’t reach the moon with parabolic and overly ambitious claims, and that you can’t skimp lightly on organizational issues or tightly sealed security. Humans behind the technology count a lot. And the whole way you construct an organization still matters considerably.  Startups screw up all the time, but the good ones do it gracefully, learn, iterate and keep moving in the right direction. Unfortunately, it turned out the DAO founders were over their heads.  Ethereum doesn't deserve the bad rub it is getting by association guilt. Yes, it is attempting to come to The DAO's rescue, out of an ethical impulse, even if it is bending some of the autonomous decentralization principles. In ethereum’s defense, they don’t want this heist to go in the history books the same way that Mt Gox did for bitcoin, although bitcoin recovered spectacularly well from it.  Ironically, it was the initial ethereum pseudo-involvement in The DAO that gave it a positive signal that precipitated record funding. On the surface, when you looked at the list of curators and saw who was involved from the ethereum side, you would think, 'How could anything go wrong when some of the original ethereum founders or operators are also 'curators?'"". Sadly, we learned that technical curators are not enough to make a DAO hum, nor to prevent it from failing.  Although the end of this DAO story is not yet known, there is pent-up demand for experimentation on DAO governance models and implementations. We can assume there will be a DAO 2.0, 3.0, and many other versions and flavors. Other DAOs and related constructs are also being worked on, taking less flamboyant routes than the granddaddy incumbent, but they still need to proceed with caution.  To say that ethereum will emerge stronger and more powerful is an understatement. Give it some time, and the fog will lift.  I believe that goodness will prevail, and dumb and evil people will veer to the left. The smart and ethical ones will succeed, and we will resume our path to implementing the greatest technological innovation since the World Wide Web protocol and its underlying Internet infrastructure: the decentralization era with crypto technologies as its foundation layer.  What we have just witnessed is a mini version of the Carlota Perez paradigm shift principle in action: The overshooting that follows the installation phase, but precedes the deployment stage. The DAO overshot its exuberance. The hacker overshot their zeal. The rest of the community will benefit from further deployments of Ethereum and decentralized technologies, once we can close this chapter, and apply the learned lessons from it.  We can’t rush a technological paradigm shift, but we can get closer to it everyday.  If we rush, like on the road, accidents happen.
