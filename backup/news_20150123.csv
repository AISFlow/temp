42398154,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbShLM,1422040835,Gallery: Bitcoin Industry Cuts Loose at Miami Conference,"While this year’s edition of The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC) may not have taken place amidst a bullish news cycle, attendees proved the underlying enthusiasm of the ecosystem remains just as strong as bitcoin's technology.  Largely absent major announcements and missing a few speakers, the industry focused its discussion at the conference on hot topics such as security, regulation and user adoption – all of which were touched on by the assembled speakers over the course of the two-day conference in scenic Miami Beach, Florida.  A more informal affair, TNABC remains a biannual staple of the bitcoin conference calendar year, although one that largely draws industry professionals for entertainment and business purposes.  View the complete slideshow here:  New ChangeTip VP of product Dan Held, for example, indicated that he was present for both days in a bid to discover new insights for his bitcoin-powered tipping platform.  ""We love to see what kind of demographic and user base attend and what people are interested in, seeing what people engage with,"" Held told CoinDesk.  Other attendees like bitcoin hardware wallet Ledger echoed these remarks.  “The conference is very important, because this is the occasion for us to meet with professionals and talk with customers,” CEO Eric Larchevêque said.  Though much of the action took place offstage, quite a few talks spurred discussion, perhaps most notably a regulation panel that was full of suggestions that 2015 might prove to be another year where bitcoin is in the headlines for the wrong reasons.  Elsewhere, much-anticipated crypto 2.0 project Factom made a string of announcements, including an impressive display of its blockchain for recordkeeping, while Tether announced a partnership with the world's largest USD/BTC exchange Bitfinex that will allow it to move fiat currencies with blockchain technology.  Even in the face of questions about the ecosystem and its underlying technology, there was much to celebrate, as six years later, the bitcoin network is still going strong by one measure – the sentiment of its always optimistic community.  For a complete recap of this year's TNABC, view our full reporting from day one and day two of the event.

42398143,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbShCV,1422019445,DigitalBTC Inks Deal With Spondoolies-Tech to Expand Mining Operation,"Australian bitcoin company digitalBTC is expanding its mining capacity and entering a new contract with data centre provider Verne Global.  The company said it is acquiring new bitcoin mining hardware from manufacturer Spondoolies-Tech, although the exact details were not revealed.  DigitalBTC did say, however, that the new hardware will expand its processing capacity by approximately 40% for a “small outlay” of about $700,000. When it launched in early 2014, digitalBTC relied on BitFury mining hardware.  The Verne Global contract will allow digitalBTC to reduce its power costs by approximately 20% across half of its power commitment. Verne Global is already working with digitalBTC, hosting mining hardware at its data centre campus in Iceland, which is powered by geothermal energy.  DigitalBTC CEO Zhenya Tsvetnenko said the new contract will help the company reduce operating costs and increase efficiency.  The company's focus will be on developing new software solutions such as digital X Mintsy, but legacy mining operations will continue to be updated, he added.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/01/23/digitalbtc-inks-deal-with-spondoolies-tech-to-expand-mining-operation,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
42398151,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbShJO,1422013002,"Payment Processor EgoPay Confirms Hack, Insider Suspected","UPDATE: 23rd January, 14:20 GMT: EgoPay's former CEO Tadas Kasputis has told CoinDesk that the company's bitcoin-related customers lost $1.1m in the hack.      Third-party payment processor EgoPay suffered a hack in late December, the company has confirmed in a blog post.  The post  claims the person or persons involved interfered with a number of transactions.  Explaining more about the hack, EgoPay writes: ""False values were made available in the merchants platform, when no actual value was transmitted in EgoPay. This hacker then proceeded to convert this fake value into irreversible currencies all within a one-hour window. These merchants believed that this value was in their EgoPay account, but unfortunately it was not.""  After discovering the issue, the company halted all automatic transaction processing, with payments being actioned manually instead.  Staff suspensions  A number of staff members were then suspended as it was concluded that someone from within the company had perpetrated the hack.  The post cites this as the reason the company's support service has been non-existent over recent weeks:  ""Rightfully, people are upset at us. We failed to communicate. We failed our membership base. We take full responsibility on this.""  Tadas Kasputis has stepped down as CEO, but it is not clear whether he has taken on another role within the company or not.  The post explains that firm is now in the process of hiring new staff members and striving to make good its obligations to its clients and partners.  Still no communication  While the company has apologised for its handling of the recent situation, it still has not replied to all clients.  A member of bitcoin and litecoin exchange BTC-e, known only as 'Alex' said the company has not been in touch since before Christmas.  Last week, Alex told CoinDesk that EgoPay had frozen $80,000 of BTC-e's funds, while payment solutions company Payeer showed evidence that it had $185,503.32 and €5,460.75 in a frozen wallet with the company.  Both BTC-e and Payeer confirmed their funds are still frozen at press time.  Allegations  The EgoPay post goes on to make serious allegations about the company's owner, Amir Aziz, although they are, at this stage, unverified.  CoinDesk has contacted Kasputis and Aziz for comment, but neither had replied by press time.  Updates will follow as more information on this story is uncovered.

42398158,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbShRG,1422009616,Winklevoss Twins Plan Regulated US Bitcoin Exchange,"The Winklevoss brothers have revealed plans for a fully-regulated US bitcoin exchange called Gemini, saying they will be financing the venture from their own pockets.  The company, named after the Latin word and zodiac sign for twins, as well as NASA's precursor to the moon-shot Apollo program, promises to be a ""next-generation bitcoin exchange"".  Gemini  is aimed squarely at the sensibilities of individual and institutional US customers who have had reservations about bitcoin's legitimacy or are reluctant to wire money overseas to obtain it.  Appeal for US investors  The exchange is ""New York born and bred"", according to its website, and works only with American banks so ""your dollars never leave the country"".  Compliance is also a key marketing feature. The site promises the company will launch ""in full compliance with all bitcoin regulations and consumer protection laws"".  The brothers have hired engineers from top hedge funds and built at least relationship with a New York State-chartered bank, according to The New York Times.  Gemini is also touted as a ""security-first"" exchange to allay investor fears that bitcoin is vulnerable to hackers.  Cameron Winkevoss wrote on the company blog:  ""It’s true that bitcoin's promise is a new, frictionless money, but that all becomes academic if we don't build towards an ecosystem that is free of hacking, fraud and security breaches.""  Chief compliance officer for the new exchange is Michael Breu, former head of information security in the research department at hedge fund Bridgewater Associates. Chief security officer Cem Paya comes from the same position at Airbnb.  Due to its banking partnership, dollars kept on Gemini will be eligible for FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) insurance and are as ""safe and secure as they are in your bank account today"", the exchange claims.  The staff lineup of about a dozen people, mostly engineers, are country-wide but work mainly from the offices of Winklevoss Capital near Madison Square Park. Only the final approval of the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) is needed before Gemini can open for business.  Early adoptors  The Winklevosses, believed to be among the largest holders of bitcoin in the world, have been promising to jump into the bitcoin business as soon as regulatory conditions were favorable.  Since 2013  , the twins have been building an exchange-traded fund (ETF) called the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, intended to trade on NASDAQ and for which they have filed a registration with the Securites and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Winklevoss Capital has also launched a bitcoin price index called the 'WinkDex' to price the ETF, which made its debut on Bloomberg in July last year.  It's not the twins' first venture into bitcoin exchanges. Via Winklevoss Capital, they also led a $1.5m seed funding round for BitInstant, the company founded by Charlie Shrem.  Upon Shrem's arrest in January 2014, the brothers issued a statement saying they were ""passive investors"" in BitInstant and ""fully support any and all governmental efforts to ensure that money laundering requirements are enforced, and look forward to clearer regulation being implemented on the purchase and sale of bitcoins"".
