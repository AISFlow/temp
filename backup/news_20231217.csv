The collection, originally developed by ColeThereum and friends, was later acquired by Luca Netz in 2022, who expanded the project’s reach. Notable for its large community, Pudgy Penguins also introduced Pudgy Toys in collaboration with major retailers like Walmart and Amazon. The collection represents more than digital art; it’s a symbol of communal virtues and a significant player in the NFT world, with its most expensive piece selling for over $640,000​​​​​​​​​​. Azuki Azuki is a standout NFT project featuring 10,000 anime-inspired avatars. Launched in January 2022 by Chiru Labs, a group of Los Angeles-based artists and developers, Azuki gained rapid popularity due to its unique artwork and ambitious roadmap.

The Lil Pudgys collection has also embraced cross-chain capabilities, allowing NFTs to traverse multiple blockchain networks.

It’s a strategic and immersive experience where players use “Immortal” NFTs to complete quests and earn rewards, significantly enhancing their gameplay in the upcoming games of the franchise. Skyborne Genesis has partnered with OpenSea for its first free NFT mint, including the Genesis Immortals and Nexian Gems collections. These collections provide early access to new content and collectibles for future Skyborne mints. The game, developed using the Polygon PoS protocol, is set in a detailed world where traits impact the gameplay, and the quests are designed to maximize player engagement and rewards. Skyborne’s roadmap and collaborative efforts with industry leaders highlight the potential of blockchain in gaming and its commitment to delivering a rich, multifaceted gaming experience​. Milady Maker Milady Maker is an NFT collection of 10,000 pieces, showcasing a unique neochibi aesthetic inspired by Y2K Japanese street style tribes. This project transcends the typical digital art sphere, creating a lifestyle and community around its distinctive aesthetic. It features innovative VR integration, allowing avatars to be used in VRtube, and a specialized Milady Minecraft Metaverse for community engagement and events. The collection also includes exciting expansion projects like Banners NFT and Redacted Remilio Babies, offering diverse experiences to holders. The distinct art style of Milady NFTs, influenced by various Tokyo fashion themes, is complemented by a ‘Drip Score’ system, enhancing their appeal and market value. This project not only presents unique digital art but also fosters a vibrant community and diverse artistic expressions​. OrdiRocks: Upcoming NFT Project? OrdiRocks is a distinct NFT collection comprising 500 genesis tokens, created in February 2023. It’s a series of digital artworks stored on the Bitcoin blockchain, forming part of a larger suite of 10,000 NFTs. With 3.346 unique owners currently holding at least one OrdiRock, the collection has a significant holder base. OrdiRocks is part of the larger suite of Bitcoin Ordinals. These are essentially Satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin) that have been ordered and inscribed with unique information such as text or images, transforming them into a type of NFT. Unlike traditional NFTs (on Ethereum or Solana) minted as new tokens, Ordinals are inscribed directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain, containing the actual raw file data. This approach differs significantly from other NFTs, which often only refer to off-chain files. Ordinals, therefore, represent a blend of digital art and blockchain technology, retaining the fungibility at the protocol level but becoming unique at the social level due to their inscriptions. Bitcoin Punks Bitcoin Punks, part of the growing trend of Bitcoin NFTs, is an NFT collection that mirrors the iconic CryptoPunks. This collection, leveraging the Bitcoin-native Ordinals Protocol, consists of 100 NFTs styled similarly to Yuga Labs’ CryptoPunks on Ethereum. One notable sale from this collection, Punk 94, fetched a significant 9.5 BTC, approximately $214,000. The Ordinals Protocol utilizes Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade to securely and efficiently store NFTs through inscriptions, essentially encoding data onto individual satoshis. The Bitcoin Punks were minted on the first 650 inscriptions of the Bitcoin network, representing a significant move in the blockchain community. Axies “Axies,” based on the popular blockchain-based game Axie Infinity, are unique digital creatures that players can collect, breed, raise, battle, and trade. Each Axie is a non-fungible token (NFT) with different attributes and strengths, making them unique in the game’s ecosystem. The game has garnered significant attention for its play-to-earn model, where players can earn cryptocurrency through gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. The game blends elements of traditional gaming with emerging blockchain technology, creating an innovative, engaging, and financially incentivized gaming experience. Axies have become a cornerstone of this virtual world, symbolizing the fusion of gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi). Decentraland In Decentraland, NFTs play a central role, representing the ownership and trading of virtual land parcels in this Ethereum-based virtual world. These land parcels are unique, immutable digital assets that users can purchase, develop, and monetize, creating personalized experiences ranging from games and interactive art to social hubs and commercial ventures. The platform’s marketplace facilitates the buying, selling, and leasing of these NFT land parcels, as well as other digital goods and services, making Decentraland a vibrant ecosystem for virtual real estate and a hotbed for digital creativity and commerce. DeGods “DeGods” is a prominent NFT project known for its unique digital collectibles. Each NFT in this collection represents a distinctively designed digital character, often with a focus on artistic creativity and rarity. The DeGods project has gained popularity in the NFT community for its engaging community involvement, innovative features, and utility within the digital collectibles space. Owners of DeGods NFTs often have access to exclusive events, community votes, and special releases, making it a dynamic and community-driven project within the wider NFT ecosystem. CryptoPunks CryptoPunks, launched in 2017, are the original trailblazers in the NFT world, holding a significant place in the history and development of the crypto art movement. Globally acknowledged for their cultural and artistic value, CryptoPunks have earned inclusion in prestigious art institutions like the Centre Pompidou in Paris, LACMA, and ICA Miami. In May 2023, CryptoPunks achieved a remarkable milestone, becoming the first NFT collection to surpass $100 million in total loan volume on NFTfi. This feat reflects the strong adoption of NFT finance tools by CryptoPunks holders, who have successfully leveraged their assets for liquidity while maintaining a high repayment rate. The collection’s integration into the financial sphere exemplifies how NFTs are being used beyond just collectibles, evolving into significant assets in the broader financial landscape​​. Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAC) The Mutant Ape Yacht Club, created by Yuga Labs, is an innovative extension of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) ecosystem. Launched on August 28, 2021, as a collection of 20,000 Mutant Ape-themed NFTs, MAYC aimed to expand the BAYC collector base. Each MAYC NFT is derived from an original Bored Ape NFT, transformed through a process involving ‘Mutant Serum’ NFTs. Half of the Mutant Ape Yacht Club collection was created by Bored Ape holders using these serums, while the other half was sold through a Dutch auction. The MAYC project has significantly increased the accessibility of the Bored Ape ecosystem. Originally, Bored Ape NFTs were expensive and elusive, but the introduction of Mutant Ape Yacht Club and Kennel Club NFTs lowered the barrier to entry. This accessibility has extended MAYC’s popularity beyond the NFT space, with several brands utilizing Mutant Apes as brand ambassadors. Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs are certainly no longer an insider tip, in fact the BAYCs have long been the most popular and most expensive NFT project. But because the price of BAYCs plummeted in the bear market, they could be one of the upcoming NFT projects in terms of value appreciation in the next crypto bull market. The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) is a collection of 10,000 unique Bored Ape NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) residing on the Ethereum blockchain. Each NFT depicts a distinctive digital character, generated algorithmically. The collection gained popularity for its blend of digital collectibles and membership perks, creating a unique online club experience. Notably, BAYCs have attracted a notable list of celebrity buyers, making it a popular NFT collection. Some of the most famous buyers include Snoop Dogg, Gwyneth Paltrow, Stephen Curry, Post Malone, Jimmy Fallon, Lamelo Ball, Justin Bieber and DJ Steve Aoki.

New NFT Games In 2024 The year 2024 is shaping up to be a monumental year for blockchain-based gaming, particularly with the integration of NFTs. The gaming landscape on blockchains like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and notably Cardano is undergoing rapid innovation. New games leverage the unique properties of NFTs to redefine player ownership and involvement. Below, we explore some of the most anticipated NFT games slated for release in 2024, which promise to offer unprecedented gaming experiences. 1. Best Upcoming NFT Game: Illuvium Illuvium, which made its grand entrance on the Epic Games Store on November 28, 2023, is a trailblazer in the AAA-quality, open-world RPG genre. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Illuvium offers a visually stunning experience where players can explore a vast alien landscape. The game’s integration of NFTs is seamless, allowing players to capture deity-like creatures known as Illuvials, each tokenized as an NFT. The ownership of these Illuvials is absolute, with the blockchain ensuring the uniqueness and provenance of each creature. With its deep strategic elements, the game allows players to battle, trade, and build a collection of Illuvials, which can be leveraged in competitions. As the first blockchain-based title to launch on a mainstream gaming platform, Illuvium is not just a game but a statement about the future of integrated blockchain gaming. BlockLords BlockLords is a grand strategy game that thrusts players into the heart of a medieval landscape ripe with political intrigue and economic strategy. Each player’s journey towards dominion is nuanced by the NFT-based ownership of characters, lands, and titles. Expected to release in late 2024, BlockLords is set to offer a experience where players can become lords, vassals, or monarchs. The integration of NFTs promises to elevate the strategic gameplay, allowing for authentic asset ownership and transfer. Guild Of Guardians Guild of Guardians is an upcoming mobile RPG that merges the thrill of dungeon-crawling with the cutting-edge technology of NFTs. Scheduled for release in the first quarter of 2024, it empowers players to build powerful guilds, embark on adventurous quests, and earn valuable resources. Guild of Guardians tokenizes every character and item, allowing players to earn tangible rewards through its “play-to-earn” model. Designed for mobile platforms, the game extends NFT gaming’s reach beyond traditional PC and console markets. Its free-to-play model, coupled with the potential for players to earn real-world value from in-game achievements, positions Guild of Guardians as a potential vanguard in the mobile gaming sector. How To Find Upcoming NFT Projects Discovering upcoming NFT projects that resonate with personal interests or investment goals requires a proactive approach to navigate the expansive digital landscape. Here are some strategies to uncover these hidden gems: Research And Community Engagement The first step is to immerse yourself in the NFT community. Platforms like Twitter, Discord, and Reddit are teeming with discussions about new and upcoming projects. Joining these communities can provide insights into emerging trends and lead to early discoveries of promising NFT ventures. NFT Marketplaces And Listing Sites OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, offers a feature-rich platform where users can explore and track upcoming collections. Their ranking system, interactive interfaces, and detailed asset information make it a valuable resource for enthusiasts looking to catch the next wave of upcoming NFT projects. Analytics And Tracking Platforms DappRadar is an analytics platform that provides comprehensive data on blockchain-based projects, including NFT collections. Their interface allows users to monitor activity, track trends, and gain a granular understanding of the market dynamics. This is crucial when scouting for upcoming NFT projects. NFT Calendars And Launchpads Dedicated NFT calendars and launchpads list upcoming drops, auctions, and minting events, providing valuable information. These specialized resources are invaluable for staying ahead of the curve and securing positions in early-stage projects The Future Of NFT Art And Collections NFT art and collections are on a trajectory for an intriguing evolution. This is marked by a deeper integration with traditional art markets and heightened interactivity. As auction houses and galleries increasingly embrace NFTs, the barrier between digital and physical art continues to dissolve. Fractional ownership stands ready to further democratize art collection, enabling broader access to high-value pieces and potentially enhancing market liquidity. In the creative sphere, AI is anticipated to become a pivotal force, creating unique artworks. The future also promises enhanced cross-platform interoperability, making the trade and display of NFTs more fluid across various blockchain ecosystems. Sustainability is becoming a central concern, with the NFT sector likely to adopt more eco-friendly practices and technologies. Alongside this, clearer regulatory frameworks will emerge to provide security and foster growth within the industry. Finally, NFTs are poised to play a significant role in cultural and historical preservation. They introduce new methods for protecting and sharing our collective heritage. As these trends converge, the NFT landscape will not only redefine artistry and ownership but also shape the cultural fabric of our digital-centric world.

This forecast comes after BTC’s negative performance in the last week, where the maiden cryptocurrency declined by 4%, falling below the $42,000 price mark. Related Reading: Bitwise Reveals Two Major Triggers That Will Send Bitcoin Price To $80,000 Bitcoin To Trade At $120,000 In 2024 – Ryan Lee In an X post on December 17, crypto data platform Brave New Coin shared Ryan Lee’s projections for Bitcoin in the new year, which were presented in three phases. For the short term, Lee anticipates Bitcoin’s price to fluctuate between $32,000-$50,000 as determined by the outcome of the spot ETF approval saga in the US. Currently, many crypto enthusiasts are highly optimistic about the SEC finally granting a green light to the launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF, following multiple meetings between the regulator and several asset managers involved. According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyfarrt, there is a 90% chance that this potential approval order will come between January 8th and January 10th, 2024, meaning Bitcoin’s price may be set for a major movement in the coming weeks. In regards to the mid-term phase, Ryan Lee predicts Bitcoin prices to range between $38,000 – $75,000 based on the effects of the halving event, which is historically known to cause a rise in BTC prices. This is because the halving event causes a reduced rate of new Bitcoin minting, which leads to scarcity, in turn boosting the token’s demand and price. In the long term, Bitget chief analyst projects Bitcoin to trade between $40,000 and $120,000 in 2024. He believes the major determinant in BTC price at this time would be US policy and regulations guiding the use of cryptocurrency. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $41,874.33, with a decline of 0.12% in the last hour. Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume is down by 16.99% and valued at $14.85 billion.

The Bitget executive expects Ethereum (ETH) could outperform BTC and trade between $3,000 and $3,500. By the end of 2024, Lee predicts ETH could attain a historic price point of $4900. Meanwhile, the analyst expects XRP to trend in a similar fashion as BTC, hitting a price range of $1-$1.5 in 2024. In addition, Lee also projects that ADA could reach $1.2-$1.8 pending a significant growth of the Cardano ecosystem.

VeChain (VET) is currently trading at $0.02945, but according to this analyst, the crypto is set for a price growth that would send it on a price growth into three sequential price targets. EGRAG Predicts VET To Hit $2.3 Related Reading: Shiba Inu Just Spiked 12% Overnight – What’s The Next Move? VET’s price has had its ups and downs this year, reflecting the general market volatility of crypto assets this year. The crypto went on a price spike very early in the year, going on a 101% growth in the first two months from its 2023 open of $0.01579 to reach $0.03186 in February. The crypto would then go on a price decline over the next few months to a 2023 low of $0.01477. However, things started to change in October as the entire crypto industry changed into a bullish sentiment. VET is now up 80% from its October bottom, and according to EGRAG, the growth is set to continue in the coming months. In a recent post on social media platform X, EGRAG wrote “VET will unlock ur financial chains,” along with three bullish targets for the coming year. A look through the price chart shared shows sequential targets of $0.11642, $1.05737, and $2.3. These targets represent a respective 295%, 3490%, and 7,500% rise from the current price. As indicated on the price chart shared by EGRAG, VET has primarily traded in a downward range, creating lower highs and lower lows since its all-time high in 2021. The crypto broke out of this range in October and has formed five bullish candles on the three-week timeframe. VET market cap currently at $2.157 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Using the Fibonacci indicator and the 2023 bottom as a starting point, the analyst drew a mirror of VET’s ascent from the 2020 bottom to its all-time high in 2021. Based on this, EGRAG noted VET is poised to potentially rally over the next few months into 2024. If history repeats itself, we could potentially see VET break past its current all-time high of $0.28 before the second price target. #VET will unlock ur financial chains. Each target—Target 1, Target 2, and Target 3—will be achieved one by one. pic.twitter.com/wqteQXzG9w — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 14, 2023 What’s Next For VeChain (VET)?

21501763,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=565703,1702803536,Optimism Price To Resume Bullish Trajectory To $3? Here’s How,"The Optimism price appears to have struggled over the past week, with its recent bullish momentum seemingly waning. During the altcoin rally, the price of Optimism’s native token OP went from a low of $1.2 to a high of nearly $2.5 before experiencing a pullback. While OP has managed to preserve a majority of its recently accrued profit, the cryptocurrency seems to be finding it challenging to continue its bullish trajectory. And the latest on-chain revelation suggests that there might be only one thing in the way of the Optimism price rise to a new high. OP Price To Soar By 26% To $2.70, Crypto Analyst Projects Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez, in a recent post on the X platform, disclosed his bullish projection for the price of Optimism over the next few weeks. This prediction revolves around on-chain data from IntoTheBlock, which is based on the density of investors who purchased the OP token at certain price zones. 26,800 addresses purchased roughly 45 million tokens between $2.17 and $2.23 | Source: Ali_charts/X Related Reading: Polygon (MATIC) Price Faces Crucial Turning Point That Could Trigger 50% Rally, Analyst Says The chart above displays how the Optimism price zones around the current value look in terms of investor density. The size of the dot indicates the number of investors who bought the OP coin at each price range. Notably, the resistance or support at a price zone is more significant the larger the dot size of that price zone. In his post, Martinez pointed out that the Optimism price is currently bouncing off a major resistance zone between $2.17 and $2.30. According to data from the analytics platform, roughly 27,000 addresses purchased a massive 45 million tokens within this range. Martinez posited that the zone between $2.17 and $2.30 is one to watch out for, given the substantial buying activity within the price range. “A sustained close above could signal a bullish breakout, potentially propelling OP toward $2.70,” the crypto analyst said. This represents a more than 26% price growth from the cryptocurrency’s current value. Optimism Price Overview As of this writing, the Optimism price stands at $2.11, reflecting a 2.4% price decline in the past 24 hours. OP’s sluggish performance in the past day underscores the altcoin’s struggles over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, the Optimism price has barely changed in the past seven days. Although the cryptocurrency surged to a multi-month high of $2.46 earlier in the previous week, it has since faced some level of correction to trade around $2.10. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Rise 800% To $5.5 – The Timeframe Will Shock You Nevertheless, Optimism still ranks amongst the top 40 cryptocurrencies in the sector, with a market capitalization of roughly $1.94 billion.

Lead developer of Shiba Inu, Shytoshi Kusama, recently provided insight into the meme coin’s endeavors as it progresses in the cryptocurrency space. Kusama Unveils Shiba Inu Community’s Ingenuity Kusama, a well-known figure in the cryptocurrency sector, provided some new perspective into the remarkable efforts made by the Shiba Inu community to improve the token’s complex economics through an engaging series of social media posts. Related Reading: Osmosis Rally Intensifies With 77% Increase – Will OSMO Hit $2 This Month? The thriving and dynamic community that supports SHIB has shown an unwavering dedication to increasing the Shiba Inu token’s overall value and utility. Through his posts, Kusama revealed a patchwork of projects that aim to strengthen the Shiba Inu ecosystem, from creative staking techniques to decentralized apps (DApps). The focus on community involvement in tokenomics development demonstrated a shared goal of establishing Shiba Inu as a strong and long-term digital asset. SHIB triggered a 12.5% increase in the last 24 hours. Source: Coingecko At the time of writing, SHIB was trading at $0.000010, making a surprise increase of 13% in the last 24 hours, and sustaining a 9% gain in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows. The announcement by the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community to burn billions of tokens in the near future clearly had a good effect on the meme coin’s price today. Kusama’s emphasis on this action marks a substantial transition for SHIB from its meme-centric beginnings to a global standard in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. Shiba Inu currently trading at $0.0000108005 territory. Chart: TradingView.com Interest in SHIB is growing because of the upcoming token burn, which could enhance the community’s dedication to guiding SHIB’s development and raise its perceived value. The administrator of the Shiba Inu Discord channel, who goes by the handle DaVinci, took to Telegram’s “Shibarium Tech” channel to make a significant statement to the Shiba Inu community. He gave the SHIB army’s expectation that the 25 billion SHIB on Shibarium would burn earlier this week some context. Here’s the update on the $SHIB burns from the @Shibariumtech TG pic.twitter.com/7dU1gGsy9v — Digarch.shib | Shibarium is live (@Digarch) December 15, 2023 SHIB circulating supply in green. Source: Shibburn He said that SHIB burns might occur at any time and that the SHIB crew is hard at work planning them. As “everything has to happen in the correct way,” he advised the people to “take it easy.” SHIB Burns Surge Three unique addresses are used to compute burns: tokens transferred to the Genesis address, which lowers the supply, and two dead wallets with no accessible keys. The SHIB burn rate has increased significantly by 10.07% in the last 24 hours, destroying 1.18 million coins, as of this writing.
