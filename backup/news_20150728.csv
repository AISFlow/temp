42378260,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7UnIz,1438120836,American Banker Conference: Lines Drawn in Blockchain Debate,"American Banker's second annual digital currencies conference was also its first to put an equal emphasis on the emerging opportunities posed by bitcoin's distributed ledger, the blockchain.  The idea that conversation around the technology has altered drastically in the last year was first noted by American Banker editor in chief Marc Hochstein in the event's opening address. The talk proved forward-thinking in its praise for the promise of more expansive and experimental use cases for the blockchain while acknowledging that bitcoin, as its first application, had kickstarted a new wave of innovation.  ""I'm not going to opine on the price, I'm going to talk about bitcoin, because the idea of it has made me a better editor at American Banker,"" Hochstein said. ""Bitcoin has cast everything that came before it in a new light.""  This tug-of-war between ideologies shaping the technology's development was on display most prominently in the event's early offerings, including a solo speaking slot by Eris Industries co-founder Preston Byrne and a panel featuring Symbiont's Adam Krellenstein, Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert and author Tim Swanson.  The most interesting talks centered around the still evolving question of whether private blockchains pose a threat to public ledgers like bitcoin, or if they are simply another evolution of the technology specialized for more specific use cases. Still, most panels sought to showcase the technology's place in conversation surrounding larger concepts affecting the financial industry, such as digital identity, data security regulation and recordkeeping.  Representing incumbent banks in this conversation was BNY Mellon managing director Cheryl Gurz, who spoke on a panel meant to highlight future use cases for blockchains. Gurz shed light on the difficulty of mediating a conversation between enthusiastic technologists and sometimes critical economists while trying to uncover whether the technology can offer solutions.  Gruz said:  ""We shouldn't just be listening, we should be challenging. We should be in the conversations with the regulators. So much is being assumed that we're going to do, so much is driven by others.""  Still prominent was conversation about bitcoin as a currency and its price against the dollar, though some panels and speakers touched on its potential use case in areas where financial services have yet to permeate.  Masters takes the stage  Perhaps the day's most anticipated session was the opening keynote by Digital Asset Holdings CEO Blythe Masters, the former JP Morgan executive.  Masters began her talk by addressing the opportunity she saw in distributed ledger technology as well as the personal journey that led her to get involved in its development.  While she said not every ""cool technology"" could be a catalyst for change and that real barriers toward wider adoption would prohibit short-term adoption, Masters was effusive in voicing her belief that the blockchain and distributed ledgers pose a significant opportunity.  Masters said:  ""It should be fairly obvious that the addressable market for this technology is absolutely gigantic. We're talking markets that are measured in the trillions, not the billions. However, there are real frictions that exist, like the cash that we use is fiat cash and resides in bank accounts and not on digital ledgers.  Echoing comments raised in a recent article penned by executives at technology consulting firm Accenture, Masters also went on to note some of the more specific questions that she feels need to be addressed, such as how the industry should move toward standardization and deal with property titling issues.  Overall, Masters seemed keen to present a unifying message to the audience, suggesting that the best course of action for the industry is to work to understand the issues faced in the traditional financial industry.  ""We need to be communicating with the existing legacy of financial infrastructure. It's important that we're respectful of that existing infrastructure, it works today and it has to work,"" she said.  Elsewhere, Masters addressed questions from the crowd, with one attendee posing a hypothetical situation designed to test the limits of permissioned or private ledgers. In this case, Masters was asked how a Venezuelan bank might interact with a permissioned ledger.  In response, she issued one of her first public comments on the bitcoin blockchain as a subset of the larger innovation, stating:  ""I'm not making claims that the bitcoin blockchain has no useful purpose.""  Separating bitcoin from blockchain  This friction surrounding the idea that certain parties in the industry are attempting to separate bitcoin's speculative currency from its digital ledger again created sparks in the panel including Krellenstein; Silbert; Swanson; and New York Law School's Houman Shadab.  It was perhaps Swanson and Silbert that served as the polar opposites around which the conversation pivoted, with Silbert emphasizing the expected high future price of bitcoin and Swanson revisiting his published work critiquing the cost efficiency of the bitcoin network when compared to tokenless blockchains.  ""If you're doing a public network, maybe the only way to do that is a token. But if you're working with known entities on a private network, you can have contractual obligations to secure this network,"" Swanson explained.  He went on to relay an anecdote in which he suggested a bank had asked him whether it would be liable if it was involved in a transaction where the validating miner was perhaps operating in a country sanctioned under US law. Swanson suggested that, with the bitcoin network, answers to questions like this still remain too unclear.  Silbert took the opposite approach attempting to galvanize audience interest in bitcoin by appealing to the speculative value associated with its tokens. His remarks suggested he sees a potential outcome where bitcoin is propelled past alternative blockchains as the use of its network could create new wealth for users.  ""You didn't buy bitcoin because you were trying solve issues with loans, you bought it out of greedy speculation,"" Silbert said. ""You have a financial incentive to see bitcoin succeed.""  In the midst of these disparate voices was Shadab, who successfully translated the debate into a moderate stance. Shadab argued that blockchains should be seen as transaction platforms that can be designed to offer certain advantages and disadvantages.  Shadab was also agnostic in his view on the bitcoin network, adding:  ""These problems can be solved, but there are technological issues that you all will need to deal with it. Is it a token-based blockchain or a permissioned blockchain? As bitcoin grows in size and as transactions grow over time, some of the benefits of bitcoin, low-to-marginal transaction fees, may disappear over time. So there's trust tradeoffs.""  Elsewhere, Swanson raised eyebrows with his typically confrontational approach to the panel session, suggesting that industry firm ShapeShift was perhaps providing a ""money laundering service"" due to its approach to regulation.  The blockchain as software  Perhaps best known for its colorful public messaging, distributed ledger startup Eris Industries made a splash with a confident presentation by co-founder Preston Byrne.  Byrne offered what may be some of the first public details on the project, revealing it intends to focus on smart contracts that use code to move and manage digital assets on a blockchain, thereby eliminating the need for a token.  Byrne claimed Eris is already working with ""several tier-one banks"", all of whom he says are interested in its centralized approach to the technology. ""Decentralization doesn't work within existing legal paradigms. It causes more commercial problems than it solves,"" he argued.  Instead, Byrne sought to assert that the true innovation behind bitcoin was that it had created new database efficiencies, effectively merging a database with its log. ""Bitcoin is a very successful piece of software, but it's just software,"" he said.  Byrne also gave insight into the trajectory of the company, which he said built a decentralized Reddit and YouTube in 2014 to prove the data processing capabilities of blockchains.  Still, he stressed that centralized alternatives to public blockchains like bitcoin could possibly be faster today while solving problems for enterprise clients.  ""There are no network effects for a database, you're serving a market,"" he said. ""Blockchain technology is better now than it was six years ago. You can get confirmations in a block in two seconds. They work in private segments, not necessarily decentralized ones.""  Nasdaq  The clearest insight into the evolving debate over the technology's development was perhaps provided by the day's final panel, which focused on its impact in financial markets.  Dominick Paniscotti, associate vice president of enterprise architecture at Nasdaq, provided the session's highlights, discussing how bitcoin only ""scratched the surface"" of the potential of bitcoin as a technology.  He told the crowd:  ""You start off with this, 'Oh it's a digital currency, should we put up a bitcoin exchange? Could we trade spot bitcoin? We can set up an exchange any time we want to trade bitcoin, the power is to identify this person. I can identify that I sent something to someone and then everyone can look at it and say yeah that occurred.""  Paniscotti went on to suggest he sees bitcoin as being one of a number of competing blockchains, ones that are better optimized for other needs.  Symbiont co-founder Mark Smith and Digital Asset Holdings CMO Dan O'Prey also provided insight in the difficulty of delivering technology to institutions such as Nasdaq, speaking about the ""long sales cycle"" and lack of education that is holding back efforts.  ""When you're walking into the door and explaining what is bitcoin, you have maybe a year, a year and half sales cycle,"" moderator Brendan O'Connor, CEO of Genesis Global Trading, said. ""When you walk in there and you're talking about utilizing bitcoin with this wallet provider, and you start having these kinds of questions, you know they're giving it more serious thought.""  Smith went on to talk about how the emphasis on the blockchain as a technology had opened more doors to enterprise institutions, concluding:  ""The naming of this conference tells you a lot.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/07/28/american-banker-conference-lines-drawn-in-blockchain-debate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a104204f46e1392571a581cb42b0d35f72ab0aa6-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42378241,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Un1N,1438110880,Lawsky: New Consulting Firm Can't Advise on BitLicense,"Former New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) superintendent Benjamin M Lawsky issued his first public statements on the BitLicense today following his stepping down from the position in June.  The comments came during an interview with American Banker editor in chief Marc Hochstein at the second annual American Banker Digital Currencies + the Blockchain Conference in New York City, which also featured Digital Asset Holdings CEO Blythe Masters and Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert, among others.  Overall, the conversation stuck more broadly to areas of interest for Lawsky's new consulting initiative, The Lawsky Group, which include cybersecurity, data management and traditional financial regulation.  Lawsky addressed suggestions that he would consult bitcoin and digital currency companies, a charge he had denied, stating:  ""I can't work at all for life on anything I ever worked on. If someone wanted to hire me to get a BitLicense, no can do.""  Lawsky indicated that, while it would be possible for him to consult on matters related to the industry, he would be unable to advise on his past experience with the NYDFS.  Regulatory outlook  Perhaps the most interesting question was posed by a crowd member who sought Lawsky's opinion on how digital currency regulation could be expected to evolve domestically and internationally.  Though again short in his comments, Lawsky offered some interesting color on his past work with the NYDFS.  ""It feels to me like there's been less focus overseas. I was in Basel, [Switzerland] when Mt Gox collapsed and I was in the room with insurance and banking regulators from the 15 biggest countries in the world,"" he recalled. None, he said, demonstrated an interest or understanding of the nascent technology.  Lastly, Lawsky reiterated his belief that decentralized ledgers could evolve to become a valuable ally for law enforcement.  ""Ledgers could be a regulator's best friend,"" he suggested. ""When you start to hear about companies that are developing great software for picking up red flags for money laundering on the blockchain that's a very powerful thing.""

42378248,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Un8v,1438097559,Microsoft Explores Blockchain Tech's Use for Social Good,"The ways in which blockchain technology can be used to support social good were discussed at an event hosted by Microsoft’s Civic Innovation team in New York last night.  Taking place at the LMHQ venue in Lower Manhattan, the event was kicked off by John Paul Farmer, director of technology and civic innovation at Microsoft.  Farmer, who previously served as the senior advisor for innovation in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, explained the purpose of the session was to explore the kind of impact blockchain technology can have when used in new and creative ways.  He added:  “Our team is in New York, we’ve been here about a year now. We’re here to work on the really hard problems – social problems – and to figure out what role technology can play in trying to address them.”  Farmer, who also previously played professional baseball in the Los Angeles Dodgers and Atlanta Braves minor leagues, went on to state digital currencies have the potential to solve many problems both within and beyond the financial sector.  Identifying use cases  Speakers at the event included Brian Forde, director of the Digital Currency Initiative at MIT Media Lab and Chelsea Barabas, senior advisor for social impact at the MIT Media Lab.  Forde, who worked at the White House with Farmer, delivered a ‘bitcoin 101’ presentation while Barabas went into more detail about the work the Digital Currency Initiative is currently undertaking.  She explained one possible use for blockchain technology is as a “canonical media notary”. Those who have photos or videos of crimes, for example the death of Walter Scott at the hands of a South Carolina police officer, could upload their evidence to a decentralised ledger. This evidence could not be tampered with after being uploaded and would help in the face of conflicting eyewitness statements.  Welfare  Another example Barabas presented was using the blockchain to distribute welfare payments.  She explained the way the US currently distributes welfare looks very much the same as it did 100 years ago, emphasising it takes a lot of time and costs a lot of money.  “Could we use the blockchain as the foundation for a digital payments infrastructure that would be much more efficient [and] cost less money also for the recipient?” Barabas asked.  She envisions people being able to receive their welfare payments in a “secure and highly verifiable way” via their mobile phones.  Another benefit of this system, Barabas claimed, would be the increased transparency, enabling people to see where exactly the government is spending its money and how it is handling the process.  On the subject of governments, she revealed: “We have governments coming to us saying ‘hey, we’re really interested in being proactive about understanding this technology and using it to improve our ability to serve the public’.”  Voting and ID  Other use cases for blockchain technology were explained by Peter Kirby, CEO of Factom; Anne Kim, senior business operations lead at IDEO; and Ryan Shea, co-founder and CEO of Onename.  Kirby explained Factom is examining the use of blockchain technology as a central land title database as well as in voting systems.  Kim, however, emphasised IDEO is being careful to not “wedge the technology into a space” that doesn’t necessarily need it.  One focus of her company has been to explore how the blockchain can facilitate frictionless transactions, which make it easier to give to charitable causes.  She also believes the technology can be used in “democratising decision-making”, with citizens being able to have a say in the projects government funds are channeled to.  Shea explained Onename hopes to use blockchain technology to provide official ID for those who do not possess government-issued ID.  This has the potential to reduce identity theft as well as enable people to do things they weren’t able to do previously, such as open a bank account, receive government benefits and vote in elections.  A tribute  Farmer rounded off the event with a tribute to 29-year-old Faigy Mayer, founder and CEO of app-development startup Appton.  “A lot of you may know her or have known her, she passed away last week and she needed help but didn’t get it. I want to encourage everyone in this room to give help and if you … ever need help, please ask.”  Farmer encouraged the attendees to continue thinking about the topics raised during the event and to come up with their own game-changing ideas.  “Please leave this room tonight thinking how might you come up with new, creative and innovative ways to use these technologies or other technologies to help people, because that’s what it’s all about,” he concluded.

42426446,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJcxth,1438082185,New Service Finds Optimum Bitcoin Transaction Fee,"A new service is offering bitcoin users an answer to the common question: what is the optimum transaction fee?  Using network data from the past three hours, CoinTape lets users compare the current waiting times associated with various fee tiers, calculated in satoshis per byte.  It claims to predict delays with 90% confidence.  The default fee used by many bitcoin wallets is 10 satoshis (0.0000001) per byte. However, according to CoinTape, paying 20 satoshis (0.0000002 BTC) per byte will get you the fastest and cheapest transaction on the network.  For the average-sized bitcoin transaction, 645 bytes, this equates to a fee of 129 bits (0.000129 BTC) (note that this is calculated on a transaction's size, not its dollar value).  The most popular fee ratio CoinTape lists, 41–50 satoshis per byte, used in more than 30,000 transactions today alone, is double this.  Network competition  As the number of bitcoin transactions rise, competition for space in each block is heating up. Miners prioritise transactions with the highest fees, working down the list until the block reaches its limit, commonly 750,000 bytes.  Transactions that don't make the cut remain in the miner's 'memory pool', a kind of bitcoin limbo. They may be included in future blocks depending on their priority or fee.  Currently, you can opt out of the fee altogether. However, there has been debate as to whether this should be raised, with a recent pull request to make a 10,000 satoshi minimum to reduce spam on the network.  CoinTape indicates that avoiding a fee is more likely to result in delays to your payment. It could take up to six blocks, or around one hour (blocks are created roughly every 10 minutes).",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Grace Caffyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/07/28/new-service-finds-optimum-bitcoin-transaction-fee,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a332a63f3bfdbd11b59f4c2ab04d8f90b680cc88-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426448,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJcxzh,1438076511,5 Things Bitcoin Owners Must Do When Estate Planning,"Jeff Vandrew is a licensed attorney, a Certified Public Accountant and a Certified Financial Planner. Based in New Jersey, he restricts his practice to two areas: estate planning and tax planning. Here he explains the steps bitcoin holders should take when planning their estates.        When it comes to estate planning, very little has been mentioned about bitcoin. While bitcoin is subject to wills and revocable living trusts like any other asset, there are some special considerations.            Most seasoned holders of bitcoin are aware of IRS Notice 2014-21. For those unaware, the notice holds that for US tax purposes, bitcoin is to be treated as property rather than currency. The notice is wrongheaded, foolish and probably was issued with intent to slow down bitcoin adoption. Nonetheless, we’re stuck with it until bitcoin adoption increases to the point where the IRS recognizes it as a currency.  Much ink has been spilled about the more obvious consequences of bitcoin’s classification as property, namely:  Whenever bitcoin is spent on goods or services, the spender must recognize taxable income or loss on the difference between tax basis (usually the price at which he acquired the bitcoin) and the fair market value of the bitcoin at the time spent.  Bitcoin miners must recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the bitcoin mined at the time of mining.  If your employer pays you in bitcoin, such payments must be reported on your W2 and are subject to tax withholding in US dollars.    Beyond these more obvious consequences, however, there are some hidden estate planning traps when it comes to the death or incapacity of a bitcoin account holder. To avoid these problems, here are five steps you need to take now in your estate plan.  1. Get your step-up in your estate plan, and watch your step-down  Because bitcoin is property, when a bitcoin holder dies, the beneficiaries of his will or living trust receive his bitcoin with tax basis at the fair market value on the date of death. For example, assume I inherit 100 BTC from my mother, and on her date of death 1 BTC is worth $250. If 1 BTC is worth $260 at the time I later spend 1 BTC in that scenario, I have a taxable gain of $10 on my bitcoin use. The fact that my mother only paid $150 for that bitcoin when she acquired it isn’t relevant for tax purposes once she has passed.  This is a double-edged sword. For highly appreciated bitcoin, this may be a boon. For bitcoin that has depreciated since purchase, this could be a disaster. For example, in the hypothetical above, if my mother had paid $1,000 for 1 BTC, upon spending I would still have a taxable gain of $10, because the only relevant factor is the fair market value on my mother’s date of death.  If you’re older and have appreciated bitcoin, it makes sense to hold onto it as long as you can so that your heirs can take advantage of the step-up. The step up may be able to eliminate all taxation of the gains on your investment.  On the other hand, if you’re older and have depreciated bitcoin, it may make sense to spend it as quickly as possible and preserve your cash. Upon spending, you’ll recognize taxable losses (which may possibly result in a reduced overall tax bill) and you’ll avoid your tax basis being stepped down at death.  2. Make sure your executor or trustee is aware that your bitcoin exists  If you tend to be private, your loved ones may never even know that you have bitcoin. Due to the anonymous nature of bitcoin, if they aren’t aware of it, your bitcoin will die with you. To avoid this result, set up some method of informing your loved ones that you’re a bitcoin holder. If you’re uncomfortable telling them now, check out a service like Deathswitch which will automatically inform them when you’re gone.  3. Make sure your executor or trustee can get your private key  Bitcoin isn’t like a bank account where your loved ones can simply contact the institution once your will has been probated. Without your private key (or in the case of a hosted walled like Coinbase or Circle, your username/password), your executor will be totally powerless to distribute your bitcoin under the terms of your will.  Since most of us don’t like passing our private keys or login info around, consider using the Deathswitch option. You can always encrypt your bitcoin key or Coinbase/Circle login before uploading to Deathswitch. [Just make sure your recipient is given the decryption key for the message ahead of time!]  4. Make sure power of attorney allows your agent to access your bitcoin  Many of us have a power of attorney document in place. This allows someone to handle our legal and financial affairs if we’re alive, but incapacitated. This person may need to handle your bitcoin. To make sure this happens, make sure that your power of attorney document explicitly allows your agent to access either your bitcoin specifically, or your digital assets broadly. And like your executor, your agent under your power of attorney is going to need access to your private key or login info.  5. Beware of the Prudent Investor Act  Most states have enacted some version of the Prudent Investor Act, which requires that executors and trustees diversify investments. If someone is to die holding a large amount of bitcoin, there is a argument that under the Act the bitcoin wuld be considered an “investment” rather than cash, and a volatile one at that. Such a classification may mean that an executor or trustee may be required under the Act to sell bitcoin and diversify into traditional securities. This may not be what the deceased party intended.  The good news is that the Prudent Investor Act generally allows itself to be explicitly overridden. Should you desire your executor or trustee to have the power to hold your bitcoin long-term, consider a specific provision in your will or trust absolving him from any liability for failure to diversify bitcoin.  Don’t procrastinate!  Like everything else involving estate planning, we never know when something when incapacity will come. By then, it’s too late to plan. If you’re a bitcoin holder, that means there is no excuse to procrastinate on these five points.  Originally posted on vandrew.com.
