42430316,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMr4Zh,1553290813,You Can Now Donate to the Tor Project in 9 Different Cryptocurrencies,"The Tor Project, a digital anonymity-focused nonprofit, is now accepting cryptocurrency donations directly, with donors able to take advantage of nearly 10 different options to send funds. A donations page on Tor's website with a list of crypto addresses has been available since March 18.  Tor fundraising director Sarah Stevenson told CoinDesk that the company had already accepted bitcoin for a number of years. What's new is that previously, these donations were accepted through BitPay, a company that converts crypto payments to fiat before passing it on to its merchant clients.  Now, crypto donations can be sent directly to Tor, which will convert the funds through the Kraken exchange, Stevenson said. She explained that Tor donors ""requested direct wallet addresses,"" as well as for the project to accept a larger variety of coins.  ""We decided to accept cryptocurrency because more and more donors requested that option. The Tor Project and the cryptocurrency communities both value privacy, so it makes sense,"" she said.  According to its donations page, Tor will accept bitcoin, bitcoin cash, dash, ether, litecoin, monero, Stellar lumens, zcash and the Augur project's REP tokens. Stevenson explained Tor has a small team, meaning it had to set specific goals when adding these addresses.  She explained:  ""We focused on two things: the return on investment of time and effort and the coins donors had specifically requested. We are currently limiting the number of separate wallets we need to monitor and manage and also only accepting currencies that can be converted to fiat via Kraken.""  Tor looks to encrypt traffic and facilitate digital anonymity, with users able to use a variety of browsers (including Tor's own browser) or apps to use the network. Its primary benefit is seen as protecting user privacy, which many in the crypto space also advocate for.

Citizens Reserve, a firm led by a team of former Deloitte blockchain employees, told CoinDesk Friday that it will jointly create a new incubation lab on Duke campus for students to work on real blockchain projects and host blockchain-focused events.  The company will also support the university in putting together a curriculum on blockchain technology, as well as in connecting students with blockchain experts and helping them find jobs in the sector when they graduate.  “As a Duke MBA alumnus, I am excited to spearhead this program, and help the next generation of blockchain advocates and leaders succeed,” said Yonathan Lapchik, chief innovation officer at Citizens Reserve.  He added:  “Many industries, including finance, supply chain, and healthcare, are already exploring the potential of blockchain technology, so it is more important than ever to provide students with the tools needed to develop the skills, connections, and knowledge employers will seek from tomorrow’s workforce.”  Citizens Reserve launched a supply chain platform called SUKU in September, leveraging both the ethereum and quorum blockchains. Participating students in the program will be able to work on active incubation lab blockchain projects through the platform, according to the announcement.  “The lab will come equipped with tools, such as mining rigs, that will enable students to explore various blockchain mechanisms,” the firm added.  Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business, will serve as the faculty advisor to the program.  Harvey said that ""it is crucial that academic institutions be willing to collaborate with thought leaders in the blockchain industry, and we look forward to working with Citizens Reserve in this regard. Duke is very proactive in external collaborations and we are excited about the opportunity for our students to get hands on, industry-relevant experience.”  Duke University already offers an “Innovation and Cryptoventures” course, launched by Harvey back in 2014.

42387639,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQlwdZ,1553278213,"Bitcoin Futures Volume Is More Significant Than You Think, Bitwise Says","The bitcoin futures market is far larger, relative to the spot market, than previously thought, says Bitwise Asset Management.  In a wide-ranging report which claims 95 percent of all reported bitcoin trading volume is faked, Bitwise says that nevertheless, the bitcoin ""futures market is significant"" when viewed in light of the remaining, genuine 5 percent of spot trading that occurs at regulated exchanges.  The report was presented earlier this week to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is currently reviewing a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposal Bitwise filed in January this year with NYSE Arca.  CoinMarketCap, one of the most prominent sources of crypto trading information, says the bitcoin market's average daily volume is roughly $6 billion, but Bitwise argues that, going by its own methodology (which it outlines in some detail in the 227-page presentation to the SEC), the actual average daily bitcoin trading volume is only $273 million.  This discrepancy means that the futures trading volume reported by the major Chicago exchanges, CME Group and Cboe, has a far greater impact on the market than previously thought, according to Bitwise. (Although the Bitwise report doesn't mention it, Cboe will be suspending its product in the coming weeks.)  The average daily futures volume on CME and Cboe combined totals near $85 million, which is not too far off from the average daily spot volume of $110 million on Binance, the exchange which performs the largest number of legitimate trades, according to Bitwise.  Bitwise said:  ""The launch of futures, the development of lending and the arrival of major market makers combined to dramatically improve the efficiency of the bitcoin market in 2018, creating a dynamic, institutional-quality, two-sided market for the first time.""  Faked volume  Futures aside, the true spot market for bitcoin essentially exists on 10 different exchanges conducting nearly $300 million in daily trading volume, Bitwise says.  Unlike other exchanges, the 10 on its list, which include Coinbase, Bitfinex, Gemini and Binance (among others) trade uniformly with one another, meaning the average spread in price between different platforms is less than 1 percent.  ""Arbitrage between these ten exchanges is virtually perfect, as demonstrated, with no sustained deviations between prices,"" Bitwise says in its presentation.  The spread is far greater on other exchanges, which Bitwise believes are faking their volumes.  Notably, Bitwise says that the U.S. is responsible for a larger portion of the genuine bitcoin spot market than previously thought,  Matt Hougan, Bitwise's head of research, told CoinDesk that his company ""built infrastructure to programmatically read data from the top 81 reported exchanges.""  The company stored order book data from these exchanges, looking at recent trades ""four times a second over multiple days,"" with this data then being used to ""run a series of statistical tests to identify fake behavior.""  The results were presented to the SEC, he said, adding:  ""The pattern you see fits natural human behavior: People are more likely to trade small amounts of bitcoin than large amounts of bitcoin, and more likely to trade whole bitcoin than fractions of bitcoin (i.e., they are more likely to trade 2.0 bitcoin than 1.9 bitcoin or 2.1 bitcoin).""  ETF impact  The fact that Bitwise just told the SEC that 95 percent of all bitcoin trading volume is faked is not an issue for Bitwise's bitcoin ETF proposal, Hougan said.  ""The reality is that the fact that there is fake volume in the crypto market is not news. We are just the first firm we know of to take a truly comprehensive approach to proving and quantifying it,"" he explained.  When ignoring the fake volume, the bitcoin market appears to be efficient, arbitraged and regulated, in Bitwise's analysis.  ""In addition, the regulated CME futures market represents is much more significant than most people think (because they have the denominator wrong),"" Hougan added.  The SEC has already explained that an ETF proposal must show that either the underlying market for a fund is ""uniquely resistant to manipulation,"" or that there is a regulated market of significant size. Bitwise's report tried to demonstrate both, Hougan said.

42430308,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMr4Jh,1553274028,Crypto Lender BlockFi Cuts Interest Rates Paid to Largest Account Holders,"BlockFi has changed the terms of its interest-bearing cryptocurrency deposit account just weeks after launching it.  Beginning April 1, for accounts with more than 25 bitcoin or 500 ether, BlockFi will pay only 2 percent on the amount deposited above the threshold, not the originally advertised 6 percent, according to an email sent to customers March 20 and a company blog post that same day.  ""Due to the demand for our product, we’re making a few changes to our product pricing that will affect your account starting in April,"" the company said in the email.  The interest rate on balances below the thresholds will remain 6 percent, compounding monthly for an annual percentage yield (APY) of 6.2 percent, according to the email, as well as a tweet sent by BlockFi's director of marketing, Brad Michelson.  ""Everything below 25 BTC still gets the 6.2% APY,"" he wrote.  BlockFi CEO and founder Zac Prince told CoinDesk that the change was caused by the unexpectedly large demand from institutional clients that wanted to deposit more than $1 million worth of crypto.  Prince said:  “We saw a rapid uptick in institutional participation, at sizes that BlockFi and the current crypto borrow market is not able to support at a 6% rate. Generally, large depositors would have a call or meeting with us before depositing and we would tell them not to contribute more than $1 million for the time being. We started to see institutional accounts created followed by deposits well over $1 million, which is not who we think of as our core client and not the type of activity we want at this time. We may create structures to accommodate this type of activity via different vehicles in the future.”  The BlockFi blog post notes that the account was meant to be ""a consumer-focused product,"" and says the adjustment was necessary to ensure the company ""can support as many clients as possible.""  The minimum deposit amount to earn interest may drop in the coming months, further to BlockFi's goal of serving ""the average crypto consumer,"" the post added.  According to Prince, fewer than 50 customers, or 1 percent of the total clientele, were affected by the change.  Fair warning  While some large customers may be disappointed by BlockFi's change, they shouldn't be surprised.  The company's terms and conditions give it a great deal of flexibility over the rates it can pay, explicitly saying that BlockFi will change the rate at its discretion.  BlockFi officially launched the deposit product on March 5, but before that had been beta testing it since January.  The interest is denominated in crypto, is supposed to be paid monthly and the way BlockFi intends to earn it is lending crypto to financial institutions, Prince told CoinDesk in an interview this week.  The product attracted a lot of attention and got BlockFi $35 million in deposits during the first two months of existence, according to Prince.  The company's terms and conditions page will be updated to reflect the new interest rates, he said on Twitter.  UPDATE (March 22, 17:45 UTC): This article has been updated to include additional quotes from BlockFi explaining the interest rate reduction.

The institution-focused exchange announced Thursday that it has teamed up with Singapore-based trading infrastructure technology provider Hydra X for the effort. The partnership will allow Seed CX to integrate its platform with Hydra X’s trading platform Sigma, which is currently in beta.  Once the integration is complete, Seed CX users will be able to view prices, trade and monitor their portfolios on the Sigma platform, as well as have access to a fiat-cryptocurrency gateway, according to Seed CX.  ""This partnership will also be useful in expanding our user base to include institutional traders seeking regulated and secure access to the world of digital assets,” said Hydra X CEO Daryl Low.  Seed CX also said that it plans to offer a market for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)-regulated crypto derivatives through its subsidiary Seed SEF.  Last September, Seed CX raised $15 million in a Series B funding round led by Bain Capital Ventures. The investment brought the company’s total funding to date to $25 million at the time.  The firm launched a regulated bitcoin spot trading market in January, saying it offered “a deep book of liquidity.” “We’re offering truly institutional level support,” Seed CX co-founder and CEO Edward Woodford said at the time.  Another subsidiary of the exchange, Zero Hash, a FinCEN-regulated entity in the U.S., launched a wallet solution for institutions last January, aimed at adding security and transparency for its customers.  Seed CX notably has a policy in place that bars employees from trading in cryptocurrency to avoid conflict of interest.

42430304,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMr4Bh,1553260253,Mt Gox Creditors Warn Mass Sale Could Put Bitcoin Fork Prices At Risk,"Mt. Gox Legal, a group of around 1,000 creditors of collapsed crypto exchange Mt. Gox, has prepared a draft proposal representing its consensus on how the exchange's remaining assets should be paid out, according to a document obtained by CoinDesk.  Mt. Gox trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi, released new details this week on the amounts of secured cryptocurrency (in bitcoin and bitcoin cash) and fiat currency it has approved for payouts to the estate's many creditors as part of the civil rehabilitation process.  In total, Kobayashi said, the balance of the exchange is 69,553,086,521 Japanese yen ($629,594,540) in cash. It also holds 141,686.35 BTC and 142,846.35 BCH – cryptocurrency worth over $593 million.  The trustee continues to hope that more of the funds said to have been hacked from the platform will also be retrieved. The estate is also attempting to retrieve money believed to be owed to Mt. Gox by other parties, including former CEO Mark Karpeles and Mt. Gox majority owner Tibanne Co.  The trustee's document indicates that it has approved claims for 802,521 BTC (worth $3,233,256,500), 792,296 BCH ($124,953,000), $38,165,664 in U.S. dollars, and other amounts in various fiat currencies.  There's an obvious issue, however. There is not enough secured cryptocurrency still in the Gox coffers to cover approved claims for BTC and BCH; neither is there enough fiat currency to cover the cryptocurrency pro rata in cash at current valuations.  And it's not yet clear how Kobayashi will allocate the funds when the payouts to creditors eventually start. So far, he has set a date of April 26, 2019, as the submission deadline for a rehabilitation plan proposal, however.  Fork trove  Mt. Gox Legal's plan– which the group stresses is not a formal rehabilitation plan as set out in Japanese law – also looks at the issue of distributing coins that have been split off (or forked) from bitcoin since the collapse, with bitcoin gold being one example.  Other currencies listed include BitcoinX (BCX), Bitcoin Diamond (BCD), Lightning Bitcoin (LBTC), Bitcoin Private, Super Bitcoin (SBTC), Clams, Bitcoin Interest, Bitcore (BTX) and Bitcoin Atom.  The group believes that the amount of additional cryptocurrency would be too much for any exchange to handle and it would be extremely complex to manage the private keys for such coins.  The draft adds:  ""We note that the volume of each of these coins held by the Trustee, in almost all cases, is significantly higher than the global daily traded volumes of these currencies, therefore we are concerned that any attempt by the Trustee to sell them en masse on the open market would result in a downward movement of the value and also not be in the creditors interests.  As a result, it proposes that the keys be auctioned off after the BTC and BCH has been distributed or moved to a secure location.  This matter was addressed in the report by Kobayashi, who wrote, ""The Rehabilitation Trustee understands that the cryptocurrencies split from BTC of the Rehabilitation Debtor belong to the estate of the Rehabilitation Debtor and will be a source of distribution to rehabilitation creditors.""  Obviously tired of waiting for their funds since the exchange collapsed in February 2014, Mt. Gox Legal also called for rehabilitation to be carried out in a timely fashion.  ""We are only able to support a Civil Rehabilitation plan that allows for interim payments at the first possible opportunity,"" the proposal states.  Among the final recommendations in the draft which was recently updated from a version drawn up last year, the group addresses the possibility of funds lost from the exchange being recovered, saying:  ""We believe it is important for the Civil Rehabilitation plan to [include] an ongoing legal entity which can be the legal recipient of any funds discovered after CR is concluded and distribute them fairly among all creditors.""  Wishlist  In the draft proposal drawn up by Mt. Gox Legal goes on to list other items set out how the member creditors would wish to see Kobayashi move forward.  Firstly, funds held by the Gox estate in fiat currency should be paid out at the same rate as would have been the case under bankruptcy. ""This includes, where legally appropriate, the inclusion of interest payments,"" the draft states.  Mt. Gox Legal also said it anticipates that after distribution of the cash claims there will be a mix of cash and cryptocurrencies remaining. That should be distributed ""pro-rata to bitcoin claims,"" it said, while it suggested that creditors be offered the choice of receiving cryptocurrency either in accounts with exchanges or to private wallets.  The trustee should also not undertake further sales or purchases of bitcoin or bitcoin cash as part of the civil rehabilitation plan, as has happened in the past. Additionally, shareholders Karpeles, Jeb McCaleb and Tibanne should not receive any payout in fiat or cryptocurrency or any benefit in kind.  While apologizing for his part in the collapse of the exchange, Karpeles has previously said he did not want any of the Gox funds, adding that the ""possibility is an aberration.""  Mt. Gox Legal intends to present the plan to the trustee on March 22.  Mt.

42430317,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMr4bh,1553256031,Crypto Lawyer Drew Hinkes Joins Firm to Help ICO Issuers Fight Back,"Blockchain lawyer Andrew Hinkes is spoiling for a fight.  The general counsel at investment bank Athena Blockchain and an adjunct business and law professor at New York University, Hinkes believes token issuers will soon start pushing back against regulatory enforcement actions and demanding clearer guidance, after mostly taking it on the chin for the last year or so. And when that happens, he'll be in their corner.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Hinkes has joined the blockchain and digital currency practice of the law firm Carlton Fields, where he will focus on litigating cases for token sellers.  ""What we have seen so far is folks just settling with the regulators, but we have started seeing some companies that want to fight back or try to use the litigation process to get a better clarity on what their obligations are by challenging some of the positions taken by the regulators in court,"" Hinkes told CoinDesk.  A member of the blockchain community since 2014 and occasional CoinDesk op-ed contributor, Hinkes has been for years advising companies including token issuers, bitcoin ATM networks, investment funds and high-net-worth investors.  Earlier in his career, though, he duked it out in court on behalf of corporate clients in construction, real estate and consumer fraud cases. As such, he will act as ""a bridge between our firm's crypto regulation and corporate practice and our litigation practice,"" said Justin S. Wales, the co-chair of Carlton Fields' blockchain practice.  This cross-training will be valuable to the team, Wales told CoinDesk, noting that the industry has already seen ""a four-fold increase in suits involving cryptocurrencies or blockchain-based technologies in each of the last four years.""  ""There is absolutely going to be more litigation in the space, both as defenses of regulatory enforcement and through civil litigation. We are already seeing this,"" Whales said.  Hinkes will keep his job at Athena Blockchain, the firm he joined last year that helps companies issue tokenized securities, and his professorships at NYU. ""Obviously, there are ethical concerns when an attorney has a stake in both in a bank and a law firm. But in consultations with legal folks at Carlton Fields, we’re comfortable with appropriate disclosures to be made,"" Hinkes said.  Battle ready  As a harbinger of brawls to come, Hinkes cited the example of the startup Kik, which announced in January that it's prepared to challenge the SEC in court to prove its initial coin offering (ICO) wasn't a sale of unregistered securities.  After watching the Securities and Exchange Commission come after the ICOs of 2017, newer projects are acting cautiously, launching token offerings in the form of STO and working closely with the regulators to avoid any troubles. But those who had already sold tokens in the past year or two don't have this option anymore.  The problem for the industry at the moment is that there is no comprehensive regulation to rely upon, Hinkes said.  ""The regulators, for the most part, have so far provided us with a bunch of orders that were written in the way to tell everyone what they expected to do, but it’s not guidance and it’s not a law,"" he said.  One way to clarify the situation would be for Congress or a state to issue a law about the legal status of token sales, but in the absence of that, the only other way to get more clarity is to challenge the regulators and their position in court, he added.  However, challenging the SEC will require some internal work, too, Hinkes said, concluding:  ""I expect that companies will push against the regulators, which will mean the companies will have to do internal investigations and will first investigate and then negotiate with the regulators. I think there will be significant civil and criminal litigation to come, an I believe it's going to become a larger part of the cryptocurrency and blockchain world.""

42430324,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMr4lh,1553253044,Bitcoin Price Drops Back Below $4K But Bull Outlook Still Intact,"View  Bitcoin failed to capitalize on a bull breakout above $4,040 yesterday, but the short-term outlook remains bullish as the higher-lows pattern is still intact.  A convincing break above the three-day chart resistance of $4,040 still looks likely and could be followed by a rally toward the recent high of $4,190.  The immediate outlook would turn bearish if prices find acceptance below $3,920 (previous day's low). A bearish close, if confirmed, could yield a drop to $3,700–$3,658 (Feb. 27 low).  Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped back from levels over $4,000, but the short-term outlook will remain bullish as long as prices are holding above key support at $3,920.  The crypto market leader jumped to a 25-day high of $4,055 yesterday, having secured a bullish UTC close above the psychological hurdle of $4,000 on Wednesday, going by Bitstamp data. The breakout above the crucial three-day chart resistance of $4,040, however, was short-lived with prices falling back to a five-day low of $3,920 before closing the day at $3,974.  Notably, the negative price action engulfed the trading range seen in the previous four days, which is widely considered an early sign of bull exhaustion.  That said, the path of least resistance is still to the higher side, as the bounce from lows near $3,920 has left the bullish higher lows pattern intact along the trendline connecting the Feb. 8 and Mar.4 lows.  For the immediate outlook to turn bearish, the engulfing price action seen yesterday needs a strong follow through in the form of a convincing break below $3,920.  As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,980, representing a 1.28 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  Daily chart  On the daily chart, BTC created a bearish outside reversal candle yesterday as trading began on an optimistic note but ended with pessimism.  A bullish-to-bearish trend change, however, would be confirmed only if prices close below $3,920 (low of the bearish candle) today. A move below $3,920 would confirm a downside break of the ascending trendline and shift risk in favor of a deeper drop toward the Feb. 27 low of $3,658.  On the higher side, a break above $4,055 would reinforce the short-term bullish setup and could fuel a rally toward the recent high of $4,190.  3-day chart  The odds of a rally toward $4,235 (inverse head-and-shoulders neckline) would strengthen if the current three-day candle closes (today) above $4,040, validating the bullish engulfing candle created in three days to March 16.

The new venture, SBI Mining Chip Co. (SBIMC), is a part of SBI's strategy on digital assets-related businesses, according to an announcement on Friday  SBIMC will be carrying out the development and manufacturing of cryptocurrency miners in partnership with an unnamed “large” semiconductor enterprise in the U.S., said SBI.  The new venture will be led by former NASA veteran Adam Traidman, who has a “high level of expertise in the field of leading-edge semiconductors and other electronics.”  Traidman has a total experience of over 20 years and has served as CEO of Chip Estimate (acquired by Cadence Design Systems, Inc. in 2008) and WearSens (Wearable device developer specialized in dietary monitoring) in the past. He also currently serves as CEO of BRD, in which SBI Group has invested, according to the announcement.  SBI Group, through its subsidiary SBI Crypto, started a mining pool for bitcoin cash (BCH) last year, but is no longer mining the cryptocurrency.

At the time, the firm said it is looking to acquire cryptocurrencies directly, including through mining, as well as establishing ways of using cryptocurrencies and providing investment opportunities.  Over the years, the firm has ventured into several areas within the industry, including establishing regulated cryptocurrency exchange VCTRADE last June, and launching blockchain-based money transfer app MoneyTap in partnership with Ripple back in October.

42430305,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMr4Dh,1553245204,Overstock's tZERO Exchange to Launch Bitcoin Trading App This June,"Overstock's security token platform tZERO is going full crypto.  Until now, security tokens had been the startup's priority, but this summer, tZERO plans to launch its own mobile trading app for buying and selling bitcoin and, possibly, ether, CEO Saum Noursalehi told CoinDesk Thursday.  The app for IOS and Android devices is scheduled to launch in June and is being developed by Bitsy — a crypto startup in the portfolio of Overstock's venture arm Medici Ventures.  ""That’s part of the reason we acquired Bitsy — to accelerate time to market for our mobile app,"" Noursalehi told CoinDesk, adding:  ""They have an app for trading crypto, primarily bitcoin, in a beta-phase, they built a wallet and key recovery mechanism, and this will be the foundation of the mobile app for tZERO. They are also working on some cool stuff like biometric login.""  The app, he added, will allow users to hold custody of their crypto without relying on a third party, and will plug into a network of exchanges through tZERO's partner, institutional trading platform SFox.  tZERO's app will connect to SFox's network of exchanges via its API, Noursalehi said, but this is only a beginning of what the company envisions.  One app to trade them all  In the future, tZERO says it's going to hold its own crypto treasury to satisfy user demand.  When tZERO acquires a retail broker-dealer license (for which it's filing now), the app will allow users to trade security tokens listed at tZERO and even traditional stock — all in one app, Noursalehi said.  As of now, the company said it wants to hire the right people to fit the plan.  Already onboard is Elliot Grossman, former managing director at Dinosaur Financial Group, currently tZERO's broker-dealer, who will lead the future retail broker-dealer as a CEO.  As for the security tokens, since tZERO's alternative trading system (ATS) launched in January, so far only its own native tZERO Preferred (TZEROP) token has been available. But, the onboarding of new issuers is on the way, Noursalehi said.  According to Noursalehi, additional companies are now talking to tZERO's team, including real estate, private equity and venture funds, as well as private companies in the technology, pharmaceuticals and even food and beverage industries.  ""I hope in the next quarter we will sign contracts with them,"" Noursalehi said. ""We’ve been a bit more selective than other ATS out there, we want to make sure the companies that want to issue tokens with us are well-funded, have revenues and will be around in the next three-four years.""  tZERO is also in the process of integrating a third-party security token platform, so that tokens issued there can be listed on tZERO. However, the name of the platform is not yet public.  tZERO booth image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/22/overstocks-tzero-exchange-to-launch-bitcoin-trading-app-this-june,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c753728078c212984c7a60eb1ac4b58c8153e9e4-1500x870.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430319,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMr4dh,1553227448,ConsenSys Spin-Off BlockApps Inks Deal With Bayer's Monsanto Arm,"ConsenSys spin-out BlockApps is working with Bayer Crop Science, the controversial agricultural giant formerly known as Monsanto.  The multinational corporation is collaborating on several BlockApps pilot projects, CoinDesk has learned, although the firm declined to specify how many. The projects began as proof-of-concept implementations in 2018.  Michael Pareles, the global digital strategy manager of Bayer's Crop Science division, told CoinDesk that Bayer’s plan is to partner with BlockApps to “increase our applications of blockchain, both in our operations and in our industry.”  BlockApps CEO Kieren James-Lubin said his startup’s aim is to graduate several clients out of production mode and into “live” services in 2019 as it consecutively raises a Series A round.  BlockApps originally emerged from ConsenSys in 2016 with over $3 million in funding from both the Brooklyn venture studio and outside investors such Fenbushi Capital, which at the time included fund advisor and ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin. James-Lubin’s father, ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin of ConsenSys, remains involved in BlockApps to this day.  According to James-Lubin, the 20-person startup garnered “more than seven figures” in 2018 and expects to earn almost double that amount in 2019 as production goes live. A source with knowledge of BlockApps financials, who asked to stay anonymous for legal reasons, said the startup also earned almost $2 million last year primarily through licensing deals and a few consulting contracts.  Growth plans  Blockskye, a startup that manages inventory and booking within the travel industry, is one BlockApps client that has already transitioned beyond the proof-of-concept stage.  CEO Brook Armstrong told CoinDesk that BlockApps’ software has become “the ultimate backend” for order processing across roughly a dozen directly participating companies.  By leveraging an open system with multiple airlines and hotels, Armstrong said Blockskye is often able to save more than $43 worth of distribution costs per ticket. He aims to expand this corporate network to thousands of travel companies by the end of 2021.  “We are focused on getting as much money on the blockchain as soon as possible,” Armstrong said.  Unlike many ConsenSys companies, BlockApps generally avoids tokens and is open to offering software services beyond the scope of blockchain technologies.  “Blockchain is a tool and not the destination,” James-Lubin said. “We describe ourselves as more of a business network company these days.”  ConsenSys ties  If BlockApps offers a successful model for how other ConsenSys companies might spin out of the parent incubator, it also presents a harbinger of what the ConsenSys “mesh” could actually mean.  Lubin is still a significant shareholder, owning BlockApps equity the way he does for most ConsenSys startups, which has been a point of contention for some. (ConsenSys did not respond to requests for comment and James-Lubin likewise declined.)  Although James-Lubin now considers his startup fully independent from ConsenSys, he said his team interacts with ConsenSys on a weekly basis and shares mutual clients.  “They are on our board. They provide a sounding board when we need help,” James-Lubin said, adding his startup is no longer a part of ConsenSys but has developed a “business partnership” collaborating on contracted projects with his father’s conglomerate.  BlockApps’ partners and consulting clients include some of the biggest names in the tech industry, such as Google and RedHathttps://www.redhat.com/en/resources/blockblockchain/blockapps-blockchain-as-a-service-solution-brief.  According to a ConsenSys spokesperson, so far BlockApps is one of nine startups to “spin out” of the central venture studio, including the decentralized exchange AirSwap. The spokesperson said another dozen companies are expected to “spin out” of the Brooklyn-based studio in 2019.
