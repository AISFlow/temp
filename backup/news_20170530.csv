42427564,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWPLh,1496178327,Bitcoin Returns to Rangebound Trading As Price Rollercoaster Subsides,"Global bitcoin prices experienced little volatility today – a notable contrast to the sharp fluctuations that have taken place over the last week.  Overall, the price of bitcoin rose to as much as $2,329.64, before falling more than 5% to $2,218.74 at 15:45 UTC, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). At the time of report, bitcoin prices had recovered somewhat, rising to $2,245.97.  In comparison, bitcoin prices experienced a notable rally last week, reaching almost $2,800 on 25th May, before plunging more than $400 to almost $2,350 less than four hours later, additional BPI figures show.  This price volatility continued after the sharp drop, as bitcoin recovered to $2,640 early on 26th May before falling once again, this time losing more than $700 and declining below $2,000 on 27th May.  Bitcoin prices bounced back the following day, rising to $2,320.82 at 09:30 UTC on 28th May.  Bitcoin's recent price volatility has coincided with sharp fluctuations in the market capitalization of all public cryptocurrencies, which surged to $91bn on 24th May before plunging 40% to $57.3bn on 27th May.  At press time, this figure has recovered to more than $80bn today, amid strong gains in the price of ether, ether classic and others.

42427548,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWOxh,1496170805,9 Years: LocalBitcoins Trader Sentenced in Latest Money Transmission Case,"A bitcoin trader on exchange platform LocalBitcoins and his father have been sentenced to prison terms after being convicted of running an unlicensed money transmission business.  The Department of Justice announced late last week that Michael Lord and his father, Randall Lord, were sentenced to 106 months and 46 months, respectively.  Both were charged with running an unlawful money business, while the younger Lord plead guilty to a narcotics distribution conspiracy charge. The two plead guilty last year.  Court records show that Michael Lord operated a LocalBitcoins.com profile, with the moniker 'Internet151', dating back to 2012. The profile lists more than 3,000 confirmed trades since it was created. Prosecutors alleged that the Lords used a series of personal and business bank accounts as part of an effort to obscure their bitcoin exchanging.  ""Cybercrime is an emerging area of criminal activity, and we want the criminals who hide behind logon names and internet aliases to know that IRS Special Agents will follow the money in whatever form, whether it be digital or paper currency,"" Jerome McDuffie, an IRS official, said in a statement.  The case is the latest to involve a LocalBitcoins trader in the US. In the past month, two other users of the site have plead guilty to similar charges. In April, an Arizona-based bitcoin trader was arrested and held following a police raid.  Other LocalBitcoins traders have been the subject of federal investigation in recent years.

42427549,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWOzh,1496166009,India's 'BankChain' Consortium Launches Blockchain KYC System,"A blockchain consortium in India centered around banking applications has unveiled a new system for sharing information about customers.  Dubbed 'ClearChain', the project is being spearheaded by the BankChain consortium, which was launched in February with the backing of institutions like the State Bank of India (SBI) and ICICI Bank, among others. The group is working with Primechain Technologies, a Mumbai-based startup, as well as IBM and Microsoft on the software side.  According to The Times of India, the ClearChain system allows for the exchange of customer information, including data on wire transfers and investigatory reports, including Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs).  The Times further reported that ClearChain is one of several projects being pursued by the group, others of which include efforts to reduce fraud in business lending.  Sudin Baraokar, SBI’s head of innovation, told the paper:  ""We are exploring how blockchain can help in reducing fraud where a borrower takes a loan against the same asset from multiple banks. We are also looking at inward remittances and the use of blockchain as an alternative to systems like SWIFT.""  The project is the latest to emerge from India's financial sector – with some interest coming from the Reserve Bank of India as well – which has spent much of the past two years experimenting with domestic blockchain applications.  Other firms in India, including its major stock exchange, are also looking at the tech.

The International Financial Services Commission (IFSC), Belize's financial markets regulator, accused One Life Network Limited of ""conducting trading without first obtaining the required license"" – an allegation that echoes one issued by BaFin, Germany’s top finance regulator.  In April, BaFin took a harsh stance against the investment scheme, ordering its organizers to dismantle trading facilities and to cease operating in the country. Other countries, including India, have also moved to curtail the activities of OneCoin promoters.  The IFSC, in its statement, accused One Life of breaking the law through its unlicensed trading, going on to say:  ""This entity is not licensed/regulated by the International Financial Services Commission or any other competent authority in Belize to conduct any type of trading business. One Life Network Limited is therefore directed to cease and desist from carrying on with the said unlicensed activities which constitute an offence under the laws of Belize.""  While the regulator didn’t detail how it might move to further stifle the scheme, the IFSC issued a warning to Belize citizens moving forward.

42427559,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWPJh,1496152850,"How, When and Where Will Regulators Accept Bitcoin ETFs?","Will bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) ever be accepted by regulators in the US or abroad? That's a question that's even more complex than would initially appear, say industry participants.  A better question might be: is it regulators, specifically, that need convincing? After all, the agencies tasked with enforcing existing laws heavily consider input from multiple parties, including banks, many of whom have yet to embrace the still-nascent digital currency.  That was the viewpoint put forward by Ryan Radloff, head of investor relations at XBT Provider, a Sweden-based issuer that's already succeeded in listing bitcoin exchange-traded notes on a public exchange.  ""It's a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem between the banks and the regulators,"" Radloff said.  ""You're not going to see many big banks jumping in until the regulators are comfortable.""  Different approaches  On that point, even within the US, different regulators approach cryptocurrencies like bitcoin very differently. Bitcoin is a form of property to the IRS, a virtual currency to FinCEN and a vehicle for 'money transmission' in the eyes of various state regulators.  The SEC has not yet taken an official stance on bitcoin's classification, but in the meantime, it has rejected two applications for bitcoin-backed exchange-traded funds thus far (the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF and the SolidX Bitcoin Trust).  The outlook at the moment overall does not look promising, said Chris Burniske, blockchain products lead at ARK Invest, an investment management company that offers ETFs centered around emerging technologies.  ""That was a pretty stern, hard line they drew,"" Burniske said of the SEC’s most recent ETF rejection. ""It's clear it's going to take more work to get the SEC to approve something like this.""  Radloff concurred:  ""Based on the response so far, it doesn't look optimistic for a bitcoin product in the US anytime soon in terms of regulatory approval, but this may change.""  However, exchange-traded funds aren't the only option for public investment.  Futures contracts, which are overseen by another US regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, could arrive first, Burniske said. And the CFTC already considers bitcoin a commodity.  What about abroad?  Regulation across the globe varies hugely, but is generally improving.  ""The countries you expect to have the most innovative regulators in 'legacy finance' have the most conducive regulatory environment for innovation in new finance,"" Radloff explained.  ""This would include Jersey, Switzerland, Malta, Gibraltar, Japan and Sweden. However in the last 18 months, there are a growing number of government bodies who have issued guidance around dealing in bitcoin, and this picture continues to become more clear,"" he continued, adding:  ""Expect more to be added to the list, likely in waves, as the space matures.""  Notably, there are exchange-traded bitcoin products in Europe, but they aren't ETFs, they are exchange-traded notes, which are similar to ETFs but carry different risks. However, European investors and regulators are more accustomed to ETNs, said Radloff.  The COINXBE & COINXBT ETNs are listed on the Nasdaq Nordic. Another ETN-style bitcoin product was recently delisted on the Gibraltar Stock Exchange.  Nick Cowan, managing director of the latter exchange, said he's expecting two similar bitcoin products to be listed soon, as well as a third based on a basket of several cryptocurrencies.  ""We have a great regulator who took the responsibility for driving this process with external consultants,"" Cowan told CoinDesk.  Self-regulating market  But what about criticisms that the market is immature? Today, there are only a handful of data points to draw on to evaluate the claim.  The recent Global Cryptocurrency Benchmarking Study by the University of Cambridge's Centre for Alternative Finance found that only 46% of cryptocurrency exchanges surveyed had a government license.  Further, differences were found region to region. Eighty-five percent of exchanges based in Asia-Pacific did not have a license, whereas 78% of North American-based exchanges did.  This discrepancy is explained, in part, by the fact that China does not have formal regulations for the industry.  In addition, almost all of the exchanges that Cambridge researchers surveyed had their own compliance programs in place that fulfilled know-your-customer and anti-money laundering requirements, even if the exchanges did not have a formal license.  Garrick Hileman, economic historian at the University of Cambridge and London School of Economics, said bitcoin industry participants have made a lot of progress over the years in their compliance efforts.  ""Self-regulation and internally driven compliance programs are a big part of the story,"" Hileman said, adding:  ""Enhanced compliance by firms has accompanied the overall increasing maturity we are observing across the cryptocurrency industry.""  First the rest, then the west?  It's clear US regulators want to see stability and transparency before they approve a product that could invite a flood of money into a market less than a decade old.  Still, industry observers also say the SEC’s comparison of the stability and transparency of bitcoin to equities stocks is apples to oranges, and that a more analogous comparison would be to commodities like gold and oil – the markets for which are often quite opaque (for example, OPEC decisions) and yet ETFs flourish.  Communicating issues like these to regulators will be of key importance.  In the meantime, the Winklevoss bitcoin ETF is appealing the SEC's rejection of its application, and there is also a cryptocurrency ETF application that has been made for an ether-based fund called the EtherIndex Ether Trust.  The SEC declined comment when asked if it would treat an ether-based application differently, but in its official notice of the fund's application, it recognized at least one major difference: ""[U]nlike bitcoin, ether was not designed to function purely as a store of value.""  In the end, an abundance of caution is good not only for investors, but for the cryptocurrencies as well, Ark Invest's Burniske said. This is because huge demand through ETFs could potentially strain the still-developing markets.  The first gold ETF bought $40m in gold each day over its first 30 days, but estimates have suggested an ETF could attract as much as $300m to the cryptocurrency market.  Given this potential boost, it's no wonder they remain a matter of interest for investors – and a potential prize for innovators.

42427551,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWP1h,1496149228,Walmart Wants to Track Delivery Drones With Blockchain Tech,"Retail giant Walmart is seeking to patent a system that uses blockchain technology to track packages delivered by unmanned drones.  The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) published the application, innocuously titled ""Unmanned Aerial Delivery to Secure Location"", on 25th May, and while that title may not give away much of Walmart's plans, the application itself reveals further details.  As outlined, the retailer is looking at blockchain tech as a way to track shipments that involve flying drones.  The patent application explains:  ""In some embodiments, the delivery box may also include a delivery encryption system comprising a blockchain for package tracking and authentication. Package tracking by blockchain may include elements including but not limited to location, supply chain transition, authentication of the courier and customer, ambient temperature of the container, temperature of the product if available, acceptable thresholds for ambient temperature of the product, package contents placed in the container system (products & goods), or a combination thereof.""  It's a notable release from the global retailer, which has revealed some of its work with blockchain in the past.  For example, last October, Walmart announced that it was working with IBM to develop a supply chain solution focused on China’s pork market, the largest in the world.  At the time, the retailer indicated that it was looking to apply the tech to other supply chains. And while it provided no hint that it was looking at blockchain as an underlying mechanism for aerial drones, Walmart told CoinDesk that it wanted to leverage blockchain to facilitate ""fresher and faster deliveries"".  The application also details how the tech could be used to establish identity within the package system.  ""Authentication and access may be restricted to specific blockchain keys to access the contents of a parcel's payload, and may include specific times and locations,"" the authors write. ""Access to the contents may be determined at the scheduling and purchase of a delivery or products.""

42427554,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWPBh,1496145618,Energy Sector Turns to Ethereum to Test Blockchain,"""There's really a lack of specificity and understanding of what the use cases are.""  Jesse Morris, a principal at the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), is a little critical of the discussions around blockchain technology trials in the energy sector. While plenty of companies have discussed the technology, outside of a handful of pilots, the use cases and their benefits have been vague, he argued.  To tackle that challenge, the RMI, a Colorado-based non-profit advocacy group for green energy, has established the Energy Web Foundation (EWF) in partnership with Grid Singularity, a Vienna-based blockchain startup. The foundation aims to foster blockchain projects in the energy sector for commercial deployment.  In early May, the foundation announced that a number of global energy companies had joined the initiative, including Centrica, Elia, Engie, Shell, Sempra Energy, SP Group, Statoil, Stedin, TWL and Tepco – firms that have pumped $2.5m into the EWF so far.  With the help of these companies, the RMI and Grid Singularity will whittle down the use cases to what they consider the most cogent and attainable.  ""A couple of different research firms have identified something like 200 use cases of blockchain in the energy sector,"" Morris told CoinDesk, adding:  ""We used that as a starting point and culled that list down to a much more manageable list where we have hypotheses around blockchain having commercial value.""  The use cases  The EWF has already devised a number of applications in the energy sector that could benefit from the integration of blockchain technology, including customer billing, renewable energy certificates and peer-to-peer (P2P) energy sharing networks.  Morris dived into renewable energy certificates, which are used to trade green energy resources and are logged on registries that track the provenance of energy from renewable power systems.  ""If you look at those systems, they’re basically screaming at the top of their lungs for a blockchain-based solution,"" he said.  Morris told CoinDesk:  ""You have different power plants that are generating energy and that energy creates certificates, they're assigned attributes and they’re exchanged. The existing system has a lot of problems, [like] certificates being double spent, not everyone can access the marketplace, [and] there are lots of small regulatory challenges between all of them.""  The RMI and the EWF believe a blockchain solution could more effectively track the provenance of these certificates.  Another use case the foundation highlighted is in P2P energy trading, where there is already some activity. In New York, startup LO3 Energy is collaborating with Siemens to create a grid that allows energy trading among peers.  In light of this, Morris envisions buildings wired up with IoT devices running on a blockchain allowing for the trading of excess renewable energy.  He explained:  “When we look at blockchain technology and we couple it with that vision of buildings being fully transactive agents with both peer buildings and different levels of the electricity grid, that’s where the real potential of a blockchain-based energy application lies.”  But all this work might first start with more prosaic but still crucial activities of the energy sector, such as customer billing.  By creating virtual identities on a distributed ledger for every building that receives power from the utility, energy suppliers could remove a lot of the human processes that are prone to error, said Morris.  Laying the foundations  In this initial stage, the EWF has opted to build on ethereum for the experiments.  ""It's going to be a proof-of-authority-based blockchain that is starting with ethereum,"" Morris said. ""However, we’re building this core tech that's going to be drawing upon different companies, different approaches, ideas and technologies.""  The wheels are already in motion at Grid Singularity, the foundation's technical partner, to trial the consensus algorithm that would eventually power these energy sector blockchain solutions.  In particular, Grid Singularity is working with other ethereum-focused startups through the foundation such as Parity Technologies, Slock.it and blockchain consultants Brainbot.  While scaling a blockchain for energy usage will be a challenge, Ewald Hess, CEO of Grid Singularity, said that while the technology itself is feasible, the challenge lies in details like regulation and industry standardization.  However, the major energy companies joining the initiative should help overcome these hurdles, by providing not only capital, but some cohesion and consistency in formulating blockchain solutions.  Hess told CoinDesk:  ""It is much easier to do this when you have a lot of decision-making companies at the table to agree on a specific smart contract which is issuing specific tokens. Then the other task you would need is whitelisting identities, that power plants are eligible to issue tokens, and whitelisting smart contracts.""  This is a ""political task"", Hess remarked, referring to the highly regulated nature of the energy sector, which differs country to country.

42427556,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWPDh,1496142016,"Fresh Off Funding, R3 Moves Corda Toward Critical Pilot","With more than $100m in funding finally in the books, distributed ledger consortium R3 is setting its sights on moving critical projects to pilot.  First up may be Japan-based financial giant Mizuho, which is now in the process of building what could be the first live implementation of R3's Corda platform. Constructed with professional services firm Cognizant, the partners involved believe that the coming trade finance solution will reduce fraud, increase transparency and enhance the shift away from paper records.  Ikuma Ueno, digital strategist at Mizuho, told CoinDesk that the bank has used Corda for other projects in the past, but that this forthcoming project marks the first time it will seek to move the software into production.  According to Ueno, Mizuho will use Corda to digitize documents like letters of credit and bill of lading invoices, which are primarily paper based today.  Cognizant itself has been experimenting with several different distributed ledgers and blockchains for enterprise, according to Lata Varghese, assistant vice president in charge of the consulting firm's blockchain projects, but it settled on Corda for this project.  Beyond being a significant milestone for Mizuho, Varghese said the project is a potentially valuable touchstone on the progress of R3 itself.  Varghese told CoinDesk:  ""This will increase trade finance process efficiencies by substantially shortening letters of credit issuance time, reducing trade paperwork processing costs and removing delivery delays by enabling faster creation and secure transfer of digital trade documents between participants.""  Going forward, Mizuho will now have to convince its trading partners to join the pilot execution of this platform. Still, its implementation may well be the first major use case for R3 that goes well beyond the proof-of-concept stage.  Valued at approximately $46bn, Mizuho is notably already well-versed in testing distributed ledger technologies.  Competition begins to heat up  While the partnership is significant because of Mizuho's involvement, it is perhaps also distinguished by being a large-scale application of Corda, which has yet to be adopted in production systems.  It was late last year that R3 released the code for Corda to a mostly positive reception, and notable early experimentation. But the bank consortium, that boasts roughly 80 members, has also seen large financial institutions JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs leave the group.  Striking out on its own, JPMorgan has own released its own blockchain solution, called Quorum, an ethereum-based platform for enterprise use. At the same time, Hyperledger and the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, a newer consortium effort, count many members in common with R3.  But the move by Mizuho is a reminder that behind the scenes other progress is being made.  Last month, investment management software firm Calypso completed a real-time trade matching test using Corda. The trial connected ING in the Netherlands, Westpac in Australia and Banco de Credito del Peru in Peru.  In conversation with CoinDesk, R3 project lead Chris Khan, distinguished the consortium's technology, saying it was built from the ground up to serve financial institutions, instead of being build for more general purposes and adapted after the fact.  Kahn said:  ""Corda was built with the privacy, security and scalability demands made by financial institutions in mind.""  Roadblocks ahead  Going forward, the biggest hurdle is likely to be regulatory, much like for other finance sector projects trying to deploy blockchain tech.  According to Areiel Wolanow, former IBM ASEAN blockchain leader and currently managing director of Finserv Experts, the challenge for distributed ledger technology broadly is that the institutions involved have to share their data.  But Corda's design sidesteps this issue, according to project participants.  ""[On blockchain] all the data is distributed to participants, but the beauty of Corda is that it doesn’t share to everybody,"" said Uneo, adding:  ""It only shares to the people that you actually need to share with. It will only be distributed to the people you authorized.""  However, Mizuho’s ability to deploy this eventual solution on a global basis will require regulatory changes. As it stands, the bill of lading must be submitted by paper for cross-border trading, according to Ueno: ""That's the law, right now it cannot be digitized fully.""  ""What we’re trying to do with this project is create gravity or create momentum by proving that this technology will actually streamline the current processes,"" he said.  Ueno concluded:  ""After completing this project, we will bring this to regulators ... We are expecting the regulators to be involved in the project at a later stage.""

42427555,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKWP9h,1496138405,How a Tiny Island Could Give Cryptocurrency a Big Boost,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis and corporate finance, and a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.    ***    Could we be getting closer to a blockchain-based, central bank-backed digital currency? Yes, but not in the way most people imagine.  The combination of technology, regulation and geopolitical shifts points to the emergence of a new type of digital asset: a cross-region blockchain-based currency.  Last year, Barbados-based startup Bitt announced the creation of a digital Barbadian dollar, a digital asset pegged to the value of its real-world counterpart and that could be traded on its blockchain platform. The news, while interesting, created little stir given the relatively insignificant size of the Barbados economy.  Now, however, other central banks in the region are joining the project – the platform will soon also handle Aruban florins and Bahamian dollars.  Given that the three currencies are pegged to the US dollar (although at different rates), switching from one to the other is a simple equation. And a smooth interchangeability would reduce friction and boost trade between the islands.  Sorely needed boost  Caribbean economies are being hit hard by the ‘de-risking’ of commercial banks. The US State Department has identified several of the islands’ financial systems as havens for money launderers, which increases the costs for banks maintaining branches there. Given the relatively small size of the economies, many international banks are pulling out of the region, cutting off access to foreign currencies.  This especially affects the region’s less-well-off, given their dependence on remittances, and pushes the economies into a downward spiral: the banks pull out because the islands are poor, which makes them poorer still.  At CoinDesk’s Consensus 2017 conference this past week, Ryan Peterson of the Central Bank of Aruba quantified the potential benefit:  “We did a calculation for the economy of Aruba, and this could potentially lead to a 4–5% GDP growth. Now that, for a region that hasn’t seen 0.5% growth in over two decades, is tremendous.”  As a more fluid flow of local currencies provides a welcome relief to small businesses starved of working capital, other regional central banks are likely to take note.  Of the 15 local currencies in the region, nine are pegged at a fixed rate to the US dollar, which reduces exchange friction. And with time, as people become accustomed to the ease of use of the digitized currencies, a logical step would be currency unification.  Quantifying the gains  This is obviously a big step, which would require an overhaul of local financial systems as well as laws. But, as other zones that have gone through this can attest, the boost to local economies is considerable.  And the Caribbean needs the help. A lack of access to foreign exchange hits trade, which accounts for most of the region’s economic activity. In Barbados and Jamaica, for example, imports and exports are over 80% and 77% of the country’s GDP respectively (compared to less than 30% for the US).  In other words, the incentive to implement a radical change is strong, and the economic risk of not doing so is a question of survival.  The transition would be smoothed by the existence of an operating blockchain-based payment rail. Governments and users can see that it works (albeit on a relatively small scale), so the trust issues will be less difficult to overcome. And the shock to local economies will be mitigated by the long-standing exchange rate peg in most jurisdictions.  While the Caribbean economies are still largely cash-based, which could make it more difficult to change currencies, the success in other areas of demonetization initiatives and of getting entire populations to switch denominations shows that it can be done.  Real inclusion  Furthermore, the emergence of a type of account that is easy to open and transact with, complies with anti-money laundering regulations and holds digital tokens that can be used as ‘real’ money would spread financial inclusion throughout the area.  Currently, only half of the population of Latin America and the Caribbean has a bank account.  If this comes to pass, we would have yet another example of an underdeveloped region leapfrogging more developed ones in terms of financial innovation and efficiency.  And a relatively small group of sunny islands could end up showing the rest of the world the benefits that blockchain-based central bank currencies could bring.
