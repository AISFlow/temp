42428859,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLeVBh,1523919643,What ICO Issuers and Investors Need to Know About Taxes,"Lisa Zarlenga is Co-Chair of the Tax Group and John Cobb is an associate at the law firm of Steptoe & Johnson.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's Crypto and Taxes 2018 series.      In the last couple years, blockchain token issuances—sometimes referred to as initial coin offerings or ICOs—have skyrocketed, both in terms of number and size.  According to CoinDesk’s ICO tracker, there were 43 ICOs in 2016 raising an aggregate $256 million; that number jumped to 343 ICOs in 2017 raising in excess of $5.4 billion; thus far in 2018, 92 ICOs have raised in excess of $3 billion.  Much attention has been paid to regulatory issues in connection with token issuances, including the potential treatment of tokens as securities subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, treatment of tokens as commodities subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and treatment of issuers as money services businesses subject to regulation by the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).  Less attention has been paid to the potential tax issues that may arise for both issuers and investors. But these issues are just as real.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has not issued any guidance concerning the tax treatment of token issuances. Practitioners and taxpayers, therefore, generally are left to apply existing tax rules by relying on precedents and rules that provide imperfect analogies to token issuances.  Many areas of uncertainty exist, including the proper characterization of tokens for tax purposes; reporting and withholding issues for token issuers; and the treatment of token pre-sales through the use of such instruments as Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) or Simple Agreement for Future Equity or Tokens (SAFE-T).  Token tax treatment  In general, the facts and circumstances of a particular token issuance, including the rights associated with a token, must be analyzed to determine the appropriate characterization of the tokens for tax purposes.  A token might properly be treated as debt or equity interests in the issuing entity, as equity in a de facto partnership among holders of the tokens if there is no entity, as a prepayment for goods and services, as “convertible virtual currency” under Notice 2014-21 (which is treated as property), or as some other type of property. The tax consequences to issuers and holders will depend upon which of these buckets the token falls into.  Equity. Tokens characterized for tax purposes as equity of a corporation (because, for example, they have rights to distributions, rights to a share of profits, or voting rights) generally do not result in current tax to issuers, and, if structured properly, investors may defer tax on any appreciated cryptocurrency used to acquire the tokens until they use or dispose of the tokens.  If the equity interest is in a partnership, however, the rules can get very complicated, and the taxable income of the partnership will flow through to the investors, so they may have ongoing tax liability.  Debt. Tokens characterized as debt (because, for example, there is a definite obligation to repay the investor with interest) generally do not give rise to current tax to either the issuer or investor, but can result in deemed interest payments over the life of the “loan” and can result in tax to the issuer if the loan is ever forgiven.  Prepaid good/services: Tokens may represent the ability to acquire goods or services provided on the platform and, as such, may be characterized as a prepayment for such goods or services. If the issuer meets certain requirements, including not recognizing the income for financial accounting purposes, it may defer recognition of the income from prepaid goods or services until the following tax year.  Property. Tokens characterized as property (whether convertible virtual currency under Notice 2014-21 or otherwise) generally result in current tax to the issuer equal to the amount of the proceeds received less any basis in the tokens.  In addition, if the investor used appreciated cryptocurrency to acquire the tokens, it will generally result in current tax to the investor on the appreciated cryptocurrency, though depending on the facts, the investor may be able to argue that the exchange of cryptocurrency for tokens was a tax-deferred like-kind exchange, at least before 2018.  Many of the tokens we’ve seen have multiple uses, including as a medium of exchange on the platform, and probably fall into this category.  Thus, ICOs permit token issuers to raise money early in the life cycle of the company, and that money may be taxed up front if the tokens are treated as property. However, the expenses to fully develop the platform may be incurred into the future, thus reversing the typical pattern of a start-up company.  Token airdrops  Some token issuers issue some of their tokens free of charge through an “airdrop.”  Recipients often sign up for airdropped tokens through the issuer’s website, and they sometimes have to do something to receive them, such as using social media to spread the word about the tokens.  The value of tokens received in an airdrop is likely taxable income to the recipient, but they could give rise to a deduction to the issuer if they are considered payments for marketing activities.  Reporting and withholding  Token issuers should be aware of a variety of reporting and withholding requirements that could apply to token issuances.  For example, token issuers could be subject to barter exchange reporting rules on Form 1099-B if the tokens are properly characterized as “scrip” through which customers of the issuer exchange property or services.  If a token properly is characterized as equity or debt, then a token issuer may need to report on payments made to U.S. holders on the appropriate Form 1099 or withhold and report on payments made to foreign holders of tokens on Form 1042.  If the token is properly treated as a partnership interest, the issuer must file Form 1065 and Schedule K-1’s to partners. Finally, token issuers should consider the potential application of reporting and withholding requirements on Form 1099 or 1042 if they airdrop tokens.  SAFTs and SAFE-Ts  Token issuers often pre-sell some tokens through a SAFT or SAFE-T.  Under a SAFT, the holder typically pays a fixed amount (in either fiat or cryptocurrency) for the right to receive a determinable amount of tokens upon the occurrence of a token sale to the public.  SAFTs typically provide that the intended tax treatment of the SAFT is as a forward contract. If this treatment is respected, then taxation of the purchase amount should be deferred until delivery of the tokens to the SAFT holder.  However, the characterization of a SAFT as a forward contract will not necessarily be respected by the IRS; the agency may seek to re-characterize a SAFT as a debt instrument or to distinguish it from a traditional prepaid forward contract and tax the proceeds upon receipt.  A SAFE-T is based on a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE), which is intended to be treated as equity rather than convertible debt. The tax treatment of a SAFE-T is uncertain, but it contains elements of both a SAFT and a SAFE.  Depending on the terms of the SAFE-T, it could be treated as a contingent stock right, a SAFT with an equity kicker, or an investment unit consisting of an equity element and a SAFT element.  Conclusion  It should be obvious from this discussion that there is little guidance from the IRS on how to treat a token offering, SAFT, or SAFE-T for tax purposes.  Determining how to characterize these instruments for tax purposes is a fact-intensive process. Issuers should consult a tax adviser for assistance in structuring their token offerings so as to minimize the risk that the IRS will re-characterize them.

A person with knowledge of the process told CoinDesk on Monday that the bank is gauging how interested clients of the bank would be in a crypto-specific trading desk. Bloomberg was the first to report that Barclays is talking to clients about a cryptocurrency service.  As it stands, the bank doesn't have any concrete plans to begin trading cryptocurrencies, the person said, adding that the majority of – if not all – major banks are likely to be exploring that option. The person added that Barclays is considering whether to extend the trade offering to its entire suite of clients, including institutions and hedge funds.  When reached for comment, Barclays spokesman Andrew Smith told CoinDesk:  ""Barclays has no plans at this time to build a cryptocurrency trading desk. We constantly monitor developments in the digital currency space and will continue to have a dialog with our clients on their needs and intentions in this market going forward.""  Other banks have reportedly been weighing a similar launch, most notably Goldman Sachs, which was the subject of speculation back in December. Yet weeks later, CEO Lloyd Blankfein shot down the rumor, though he left the door open to opening a crypto-focused trading desk during remarks in January.  Hedge funds are increasingly interested in trading cryptocurrencies, providing a growing client base for investments banks carrying out cryptocurrency trading.  Around 245 crypto-focused funds are currently operating, according to data provided by Autonomous Research. Despite an intense drawdown in cryptocurrency prices, only around nine of these funds have reportedly closed in 2018.

Also involved in the project are insurance non-profit ACORD Corporation and ISN Software Corp., according to Monday's announcement. Together, the companies are developing the platform – which will help streamline the process by which companies can verify that a contractor has the insurance they claim to possess – using the Hyperledger Fabric code as well as IBM's Blockchain Platform.  The permissioned blockchain built within the platform allows only certain parties to gain access to data in real-time, according to the release. The ledger replaces a manual, paper-based system which the company currently relies on, with the new system allowing for certain parts of the verification certificate to populate in real time in a bid to save time and money.  ""Marsh sees great opportunity in leveraging blockchain technology to better serve our clients by maximizing efficiency and creating new opportunities in the insurance value chain,” Sastry Durvasula, Marsh's chief digital officer and chief data and analytics officer, said in a statement.  The platform is currently being developed in a pilot stage, according to Marsh. The broker – which made nearly $2 billion in profits in 2016, according to available figures – said it expects to launch a production version later this year. Those efforts will be fueled by the input received from ACORD as well as feedback from ISN, according to Monday's release.  ""IBM is committed to connecting emerging blockchain networks to facilitate the next generation economy. This is an ideal example of how blockchain can be used on a much broader scale to drive real business results,"" Sandip Patel, general manager of IBM's insurance division, said of the pilot.

42380578,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gSP7,1523902520,Decentralized Exchange Startup 0x Raised $775K in SAFT Sale Last Year,"Correction (16th April 5 p.m. EST): An earlier version of this article inaccurately reported that the $775k was drawn from a recently conducted SAFT sale. According to 0x, the funds were sourced from a SAFT sale conducted last year with investors.  This article has been updated to amend the inaccurate information.      Decentralized exchange protocol developer 0x raised $775,000 last year through a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) sale.  A Form D filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from April 3 reveals that 22 investors participated in the sale.  Previously, the company said that it raised an undisclosed amount from various venture firms, including Polychain Capital, Blockchain Capital, Pantera Capital, Jen Advisors and FBG Capital. The filing represents the first time that the actual amount raised and the precise number of investors have been disclosed.  The startup garnered $24 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) the company completed last August. At the time, 12,000 backers invested in the startup.  0x's over-the-counter platform is aimed at enabling the exchange of different ERC20 tokens across varying networks, as previously reported. The platform was first released for testing in May 2017.  At the time, founder Will Warren said the startup would not provide a real-time public order book, instead focusing on the creation of open-source tools so that other startups could build their own decentralized exchanges.

42380566,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gSA1,1523898358,CFTC Chairman: I Am Not a Cryptocurrency Evangelist,"The head of the U.S. commodities regulator had a clear message during a speech on Friday: he is not an evangelist for cryptocurrencies.  Speaking at Vanderbilt Law School last week, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo addressed the notoriety he experienced after delivering remarks that appeared sympathetic to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  As previously reported, Giancarlo testified before a Senate committee on the topic in February, notably saying that ""we owe it to this new generation to respect their enthusiasm about virtual currencies with a thoughtful and balanced response, not a dismissive one.""  He added at the time that it is important for policymakers to educate themselves about the topic, while at the same time cracking down on the fraudsters who take advantage of investors' enthusiasm.  As Giancarlo relayed on Friday, those comments in February won plaudits from the cryptocurrency community, tens of thousands of Twitter followers, and a new nickname and hashtag: #CryptoDad.  Yet he didn't want the attention the remarks brought, telling event attendees:  ""I neither expected nor desired that a few words spoken during a Senate hearing broadcast on C-SPAN would lead to an Andy Warhol '15 minutes of fame.' Nor was I – or am I – a virtual currency evangelist.""  Giancarlo continued by pointing out that ""get rich quick schemers"" and ""shady entrepreneurs"" are common in the cryptocurrency sector, but that they are joined by ""a growing contingent of professional, institutional users.""  ""What I had acknowledged at that Senate hearing is the existence of a community that views technology as an agent of social change. Many of them have come of age during the 2008 financial crisis - the same crisis to which Bitcoin had emerged in response,"" he went on to say.  Turning to the subject of regulation, Giancarlo pointed out that the Commodity Exchange Act contains no reference to cyrptocurrencies, so the law must be reinterpreted to fit new technology – assuming it is not revised by legislators. ""  It is like an old computer operating system that struggles to support this new and complex application,"" he said.

42380573,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gSHZ,1523894402,Coinbase Just Bought One of Bitcoin's Best-Funded Startups,"Cryptocurrency startup Coinbase has announced the acquisition of Earn.com, one of the industry's best-funded startups.  A statement released on Monday confirms a previous CoinDesk report in which sources said that Coinbase and other potential buyers were in talks to acquire Earn.com, formerly known as 21 Inc.  21 Inc previously ran a bitcoin mining operation, powered by technology from Intel, and later launched its eponymous, developer-focused 21 Bitcoin Computer in 2015. The company was backed by major Silicon Valley investors to the tune of $116 million raised over multiple funding rounds.  The firm rebranded to Earn.com last October in a pivot that saw it launch a social network aimed at incentivizing users to complete tasks in exchange for cryptocurrency rewards.  While Coinbase did not publicly disclose the terms of the deal, a source directly involved in the discussions told CoinDesk previously that the total amount in cash, crypto-assets, stocks and earn-out being pursued at the time could exceed $120 million.  According to a new report from Recode, the Coinbase deal ""was slightly more than $100 million. The publication also reported that some of Earn's existing investors initially balked at the offer.  As part of the acquisition, Balaji Srinivasan, co-founder and CEO of Earn.com, will become Coinbase's first chief technology officer. The Earn.com team will be integrated with Coinbase's operations and its existing business will continue, Coinbase said.  The startup said:  ""Earn has built a paid email product that is arguably one of the earliest practical blockchain applications to achieve meaningful traction. We will keep Earn’s business running because it’s showing a lot of promise and potential.""  In his new capacity, Srinivasan will help lead the development of the Coinbase platform, and also recruit new cryptocurrency talent.

42380580,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gSSt,1523891448,What If You Can't Pay Taxes on Your Crypto Gains?,"Kirk Phillips is an entrepreneur, certified public accountant (CPA) and author of ""The Ultimate Bitcoin Business Guide: For Entrepreneurs & Business Advisors.""  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's Crypto and Taxes 2018 series.        Your attempt to get clarity around crypto tax brainteasers can result in some surprising and unexpected tax liabilities at this time of year.  As we've seen through the CoinDesk crypto tax series, there's a whole new realm of tax considerations that didn't exist four years ago. Maybe you're caught in a crypto squeeze play, wondering how to pay tax liabilities by liquidating the crypto you don't want to liquidate.  Perhaps you're finding out that some crypto you received at its highest historical price is taxed as ordinary income and now it's worth 30 percent of its former self.  For example, you got paid in Xcoin on the date of its $32 historical high, then the floor dropped out of the market, the price slid to $9 and you continued to HODL. Then you sell all your Xcoin at $9 to cover the tax and end up back at zero.  These situations are not for the faint of heart.  Extensions and payments  If you need more time to gather information for your crypto tax calculations, you can always file an individual extension on April 17 for tax year 2017.  Importantly, extensions only extend the time to file, not to pay taxes. Filing tax returns and making the related tax payments are independent of, and parallel to, one another.  Payments have to be timely to avoid penalties and interest, regardless of whether you file on time or extend your return.    Penalties as friends        Generally speaking, if you made estimated tax payments for 2017 equal to or greater than your 2016 tax, then you're in the safe harbor for that big tax payment on your once-in-a-lifetime gains until the April deadline.  For example, if your 2016 tax was $30,000 and you estimate 2017 taxes at $150,000, you should have paid 2017 estimated taxes of at least $30,000, which leaves you needing to pay $120,000 on the April due date.  But what if you can't pay or don't want to pay the tax at the moment penalties and interest start accruing?  This could be a strange-but-true tax strategy where you end up with more resources rather than less. Penalties and interest are seen as a taboo paradigm, but sometimes they can be your friend.    Installment agreements        Individuals can generally get an installment agreement for a tax liability of $50,000 or less, including penalties and interest, for up to 72 months, no questions asked.  Businesses can get a similar arrangement for $25,000 or less. Anything over those amounts requires you to go under the IRS microscope by filing additional paperwork.  For example, you're an individual with a $150,000 tax liability, so you painfully pay $100,000 and then finance the remaining $50,000 by using and managing future cash flows and crypto appreciation.  You make several monthly payments of $800 each until the crypto market explodes later in 2018, allowing you to sell for big gains while paying your tax in full with a smile.  In this scenario, you’ll have paid $3,500 in penalties and interest, but you benefited from $65,000 of appreciation by leveraging the IRS gift of installment payments.  In addition, liquidating any position in a hurry, crypto or otherwise, is not a good investment strategy, and an installment agreement buys you time to systematically liquidate – like dollar-cost averaging in reverse.  You will also likely end up with more resources using this method rather than an all-at-once liquidation near the tax deadline.  There's still risk  All else equal, you should always pay your taxes in full and on time. However, if you're willing to take the risk, now you know how to do it and take advantage of tax financing.  Keep in mind that instead of a sustained crypto market rebound, the opposite could happen and your portfolio could tank further, putting you in a worse position.  It's a game of hedging and managing resources. Die-hard crypto enthusiasts already know this well.

42380585,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gSWf,1523889605,Why Ripple's XRP Outperformed the Other Top Cryptos This Week,"Ripple's XRP token has gone from the worst performing top-5 cryptocurrency to the best performer in just one week.  As of writing, the world's third-largest cryptocurrency by market value is trading at $0.6574 – up 33.66 percent week-on-week, according to CoinMarketCap.  The news come, of course, as the wider crypto markets have regained poise over the last week. But while the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is up 30 percent week-on-week, XRP has outpaced even that notable recovery.  The table below shows how XRP fared compared to its peers over the last week:  XRP had a disastrous start to the year, dropping 77.77 percent in the first quarter. The token had dropped by 87.86 percent as of April 1 (no joke) – numbers that made it the worst performer in the top 5 at the time.  However, XRP had been looking very oversold, as per the daily relative strength index (RSI), and a rally was perhaps inevitable.  News flow may have also played a role in the gains, with CoinDesk reporting last week that Spain-based banking giant Santander is launching One Pay FX - a cross-border payments app developed in partnership Ripple. The news garnered lots of attention from the investor community and may have put a bid under XRP. It's worth noting, though, that the application does not use XRP token.  Looking ahead, there is widespread belief that Wall Street bigwigs like Soros and Rockefeller are about to kick start another bull run in crypto markets. Ripple, with its multiple partnerships with banks and other financial institutions, might be best suited to benefit from a resulting inflow of money into the crypto space.  The technical charts, too, indicate that XRP could continue to outperform bitcoin in the near future.  XRP/BTC daily chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows a Bollinger band (+2 and -2 standard deviations from the 20-day MA) squeeze, followed by an upside breakout on April 12.  A squeeze occurs when volatility falls to very low levels and the Bollinger bands narrow into a tight range. These periods of low volatility (range trading) are often followed by periods of high volatility (range breakout).  Note that XRP's volatility on April 9 reached the lowest levels since late November, hinting at the breakout move seen on Saturday. Furthermore, the daily RSI is biased to the bulls.  Taking all this into account, XRP may see a more gains against BTC over the next couple of weeks.  View  XRP/BTC is likely to test 0.00012–0.00012472 BTC (Feb. 14 high) over the next couple of weeks.  However, a break below 0.000074 BTC (20-day MA) would abort the bullish view.  A daily close (as per UTC) below 0.000069 BTC (April 3 low) would signal a bullish-to-bearish trend change and would open doors for a drop to 0.000060BTC.

Bloomberg  reported Monday that Samsung Electronics is said to be already building a distributed ledger system to track international shipments, and expects that the move could slash shipping costs by 20 percent.  Samsung SDS, the group’s logistics and IT subsidiary, is reportedly developing the platform.  ""It will have an enormous impact on the supply chains of manufacturing industries. Blockchain is a core platform to fuel our digital transformation,"" Song Kwang-woo, blockchain lead and vice president at SDS, told Bloomberg.  According to the report, SDS will ship around 500,000 tons of air freight and around 1 million shipping containers in 2018 – goods worth tens of billions of dollars.  Turning to a blockchain-based system is hoped to allow the firm to reduce overheads, such as costly shipping documentation, and allow it to respond more quickly to market movements.  Samsung isn't the only major firm to be moving to adopt blockchain tech in the supply chain industry. Big names like IBM, NTT Data and Air France have all been working on separate systems to bring added efficiencies and transparency to their networks over the last year.

42380569,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gSDn,1523880025,Vitalik's Serious Joke: The Case for Ending Ethereum Inflation,"It turns out, Vitalik wasn’t exactly joking.  Sure, that might be what most people thought when ethereum's creator published a controversial proposal on April Fool's Day, but the post has prompted a very real, very serious conversation about whether the underlying economics of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency should be altered.  In fact, in the weeks since the concept was first floated, dialogue has only gotten more heated about the idea that a limit could be placed on the total number of ether, ethereum's cryptocurrency, that could ever be created. And while it's long been a contentious topic (there isn't currently a cap), the rate at which new coins are being introduced into the market has been growing.  Buterin appears aware of the concern, citing “economic sustainability” as the reason he wants to stop creating new ether when 120 million are introduced. In fact, he believes limiting the market supply to exactly that figure, twice the number of ether sold in the platform's 2014 ethereum fundraising, could help long term.  In a developer meeting last week, Buterin outlined his rationale further, and while his comments were initially greeted with giggles from other core developers, the atmosphere quickly gave way to serious reflection.  From a technical standpoint, the change would be easy to implement, and pending sufficient community support, it could be executed with a simple code fix as part of ethereum's next system-wide software update.  On one side, the concept has been applauded by ether investors. Lacking a formal stance on similar to say, bitcoin's limited 21 million bitcoin supply, some investors have remained cautious, if not confused, about whether they should put their money in.  Nevertheless, the proposed issuance cap has also been the brunt of heavy criticism.  For one, critics cite ether’s role for the platform's security and are warning that the introduction of a cap would make the cryptocurrency a pure speculative investment play, something that many developers worry will make updating the protocol more challenging. Others take offense with what they claim is a poorly timed, if not poorly researched issue.  ""I don’t think that we have the understanding required to actually meaningfully know what we would be consenting to,"" Vlad Zamfir, a leading developer behind ethereum’s upcoming proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, wrote in a blogpost. “The numbers seem completely arbitrary,” another critic wrote.  And a vocal opponent of the proposal, ethereum developer Nick Johnson tweeted:  “[The post] has degraded into a bunch of people arguing pseudo economics with each other, as if ethereum were designed first and foremost to be an economy and not a computing system.”  The arguments against  Sure enough, the critics seem particularly worried about what the economic incentives could mean for ether's role as a ""crypto fuel"" for the network.  “Ether has a primary intrinsic purpose on the ethereum protocol, that is, to be consumed as a resource with which to run calculations upon a computational machine,"" an independent ethereum developer, Darryl Morris, wrote in a blog post.  According to Morris, ether's use as an investment tool shouldn't be prioritized over its ability to secure and protect the protocol, something he thinks the proposal would do.  Speaking at a developer meeting Friday, Johnson echoed similar points. Because such a limit would, theoretically, cause the value of ether to rise, transactions that burn small amounts of ether would be disincentivized.  “Funding through transaction fees encourages holding and discourages an active ecosystem,” Johnson said. Continuing, Johnson said this would lead to a harmful spiral, where “costs go up because transactions are fewer and that leads to fewer transactions and so forth.""  And the opposition started some time before Buterin's recent proposal. Zamfir, for example, has spoken out against putting a limit on the issuance of ether in the past. Speaking to CoinDesk in February, Zamfir described the discussion as “bikeshedding.""  He told CoinDesk:  “The entire cryptocurrency HODLer scene is apparently obsessed about issuance policies, even though issuance has very, very, very little to do with a cryptocurrency's success.”  He further speculated that, should a cap be passed, miners might have reasons to inherently oppose the idea, since a hard cap could limit their future payouts.  ""Hodlers and miners have obvious major conflicts of interests which makes it impossible to count on them to care about any notion of public good or even any kind of impartial truth about optimal parameters,"" Zamfir said.  Speaking in a blog post, Zamfir continued to state that understanding of the matter is limited, and using scarcity as an investment value-add is ""stupid and annoying at best.""  And finally, others have argued that an issuance cap would raise the cost of entry into the network, something that contradict the long-standing value proposition of keeping these costs low so that anyone can participate and in turn, make the network more decentralized.  Speaking to that, one Reddit user wrote: “Great if you want to maximize your personal wealth, but shit if you want to create a decentralized economy.”  The arguments in favor  But from Buterin’s research, none of these things hold true.  In the developer meeting last week, Buterin stressed that transaction fees are not proportional to the price of ether, but rather reflect demand for the ethereum platform. This means that irrespective of a price rise, if the numbers of transactions remain the same, fees on the platform would not increase.  Plus, according to him, it isn't up to ethereum to provide an affordable entry into cryptocurrency, that instead, new cryptocurrencies will provide that onramp.  ""Crypto can avoid being too inegalitarian through [the] emergence of new coins, not through any single coin being super-inflationary,"" Buterin tweeted.  While the inflation rate on ethereum is currently quite low, Buterin contended that even small rates of inflation are a “huge deal” in the context of financial market returns.  With an unlimited supply, Buterin warned that ether could even be surpassed in market capitalization by one of the ERC-20 tokens that have been launched on top of ethereum. As tokens can be programmed without inflation, Buterin explained, “basically every ERC-20 token becomes a better store of value than ETH.”  And on the topic of miner payouts, Buterin argued at the meeting that rather than miners being paid with newly-created ether, miners could, in the future, be paid directly by transaction fees.  According to Buterin, that change would be simple to implement, since all the remaining ether could be locked into a smart contract, and dished out to miners via fees over time.  “It would set any rewards to be proportional to the balance remaining inside of the contract,” Buterin said.  And while rewards would decrease as the total ETH supply converges toward its limit – potentially disincentivizing miners – Buterin said that inflation poses a similar risk. ""If we have a cryptocurrency which is inflationary then that could lead to its value dropping, which by itself leads to less capital securing the network,"" Buterin said.  And though he admits that it's a complicated thing to measure, Buterin said, ""I personally do think that there’s evidence that basically transaction fee levels are capable of providing enough revenue to secure a blockchain.""  He added:  ""And in the long run, if they’re not, then there’s the question of well, how valuable is the system that we’re building in the first place.”  Balloon animal image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Rachel-Rose O'Leary,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/16/vitaliks-serious-joke-the-case-for-ending-ethereum-inflation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6106984e93f12cb1e03c24714434e0462cb0ec2b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42380582,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gSNr,1523876751,Malta Proposes Test to Define When ICOs Are Securities,"The EU nation of Malta is moving closer to introducing a test that would clearly define when assets derived from initial coin offerings (ICOs) are securities.  In a consultation paper published Friday, for which it is currently seeking public feedback, the Malta Financial Services Authority (FSA) set out a proposal for a so-called Financial Instrument Test, which would ultimately become part of its proposed Virtual Financial Asset Act (VFAA).  The agency said the methodology of the test has been designed based on feedback from the its previous discussion paper, released in November 2017, which initially introduced the concept.  According to the latest paper, the test comprises a three-stage process that would first verify whether a distributed ledger technology (DLT) asset falls under the category of ""virtual tokens"" – effectively the agency's term for what the industry calls utility tokens.  The paper states:  ""Virtual token is a DLT asset which has no utility, value or application outside of the DLT platform on which it was issued and that cannot be exchanged for funds on such platform or with the issuer of such DLT asset.""  Tokens falling under this category would be exempted from the VFAA, according to the FSA.  Assets that can be traded in a secondary market would then pass to the second phase of the test, where various securities definitions set by European financial regulators will be applied, including transferable securities, money market instruments or financial derivatives.  Should a token fall under the definition of any of those assets, it would then come under the regulatory oversight of the existing Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) that is enforced within the European Union financial markets.  However, a negative result in stage two would lead to the third stage of the test, which would see ICO tokens regulated under the proposed VFAA. The FSA said this method would embrace a hybrid framework that adopts both existing EU regulations, as well as a national ones.  Proposed to cover all ICOs organized in Malta, the paper is currently open for public input until May 5, the agency said.  The developing regulatory framework in Malta comes as the island's government is seeking to embrace blockchain innovation with a well-established legal environment aimed to attract blockchain businesses to the country.

42380586,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gSXv,1523872843,"Resistance Ahead: Bitcoin Bulls Must Break $8,500","A move above resistance at $8,500 would provide confirmation bitcoin's bear market has ended, the technical charts indicate.  Over the weekend, the cryptocurrency clocked a three-week high of $8,458 on Bitfinex, adding credence to the short-term bull reversal confirmed last Thursday. Further, the 30 percent rally from $6,425 (April 1 low) proved that the much-feared ""death cross"" indicator was in fact a bear trap.  Still, the job is only part done, as bitcoin (BTC) has yet to violate the descending trendline established since Dec. 17.  Daily chart  As seen in the chart above, the descending trendline, representing a series of lower price highs over the last four months, is still intact. The trendline hurdle is seen around $8,500. The 50-day moving average (MA) is also lined up at 8,516.  A high volume break above the confluence of the trendline and the 50-day MA could be considered the final confirmation of the bearish-to-bullish trend change.  That said, BTC's first attempt to scale the key resistance failed – running out of steam at $8,415 and falling back to $8,100 this morning. As of writing, the ascending (bullish biased) 5-day MA is capping the downside in prices.  There may be clues as to the reason for the retreat in the short-duration chart below.  4-hour chart  The bearish relative strength index (RSI) divergence is a slightly worrying sign for the bulls and could yield a drop to $7,700–$7,600 range.  However, such a decline would likely be short-lived, as the 5- and 10-day MAs are biased to the bulls (trending north). While, last Thursday's over $1,000 rally confirmed a double bottom bullish reversal and falling wedge breakout (bullish pattern).  Furthermore, the weekly chart below indicates that bitcoin has established the ascending 50-MA as a strong support, meaning that only a close below that line would revive the bearish view.  Weekly chart  Many traders/analysts are of the opinion that only a move above $11,700 would signal a long-term bull market reversal.  While that may be true, a convincing move above $8,500 (falling trendline hurdle as seen in the daily chart) could be considered as an advance indicator of an impending break above $11,700. That's because the breach of the trendline hurdle would signal the end of the downtrend from bitcoin's December all-time high of around $20,000.  View  A high volume break above $8,500 (falling trendline hurdle would confirm a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.  A healthy pullback to $7,700–$7,600 could be seen, but will likely be short-lived.  A daily close (as per UTC) below the 10-day MA would abort short-term bullish view.  Only a break below the weekly 50-MA (currently seen at $6,9510) would revive the bearish outlook.

In a speech at an investment industry function on Friday, Julia Leung, deputy head of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), once more cautioned the public over fundraising activities associated with the technology.  ""While we acknowledge that innovative technologies such as blockchain have the potential to improve efficiency and financial inclusion, that does not entitle anyone to conduct fundraising from the public in violation of securities law,"" Leung said.  She further raised concerns that, while disguised as blockchain technology, many ICO projects may not be genuinely offering technological innovation and pose risks for investors.  Leung stated:  ""Further complicating matters, many of these fundraising (activities) are dubious, if not downright frauds. The issuers escape the scrutiny of the police or securities regulators because of their cross-border nature and the way the crypto assets are structured to fall outside any regulator’s perimeter.""  The comments come just weeks after the agency halted an ICO project over concerns it was offering unregistered securities in Hong Kong. Previously, the SFC has ordered several exchanges to delist tokens derived from ICOs that were also regarded by the agency as securities.  As part of its efforts over the technology, the SFC is also moving to educate the public about the perceived risks of investments in cryptocurrencies.  In January, the SFC and another agency launched a media campaign across the city's subway system in an effort to dampen the growing hype over ICO investments.  In Friday's speech, Leung attributed the popularity of such investments to a gambling mindset, saying: ""Many millennials who subscribe to digital tokens in ICOs understand that there is no intrinsic value in the tokens but are betting on the rapid rise of the token value in the secondary market.""

42380574,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gSK5,1523865650,Bitcoin Miner Blames Trading Crackdown in China for Shooting,"A bitcoin miner in Taiwan is blaming the crackdown on bitcoin trading in mainland China for an incident in which he was shot by local gangsters.  According to a report from Taiwanese news source Liberty Times, the incident occurred on Saturday night, local time, when the two suspects allegedly scheduled to meet a bitcoin miner with whom they had made a significant investment.  The miner, who reportedly has the surname Wu, had previously accepted 10 million Chinese yuan (roughly $1.7 million) from the two – surnamed Li and Gao – in order to participate the bitcoin mining operation. While the exact whereabouts of the mining facility remains unknown, the report hinted that the location could be inside mainland China.  Despite having made some $370,000 in profit, Wu claimed in the report that due to tightened regulations on bitcoin trading in China, the profit could not be exchanged for fiat currency in time, as per the two gangsters' demands – a factor that sparked a dispute at the meeting.  As things got heated, Wu was reportedly shot in the ankle. The gangsters fled the crime scene, but turned themselves into the police seven hours after the event. The police later confirmed the suspects were from local gangs, the report stated.  Though it isn't the first instance of a crime alleged to have involved bitcoin in Taiwan, the case appears notable for the involvement of participants in organized crime.  The news also marks another incident in which the surging price of bitcoin over the past year has led to crimes involving armed assailants. As reported by CoinDesk, two cases in Canada and the U.K. in January saw thieves robbing bitcoin investors at gunpoint.  And, just last week, Singapore's police force reported a case in which bitcoin brokers were robbed of some $300,000.

42380584,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gSVP,1523858423,Crypto Tax Dodgers Are Tempting Fate,"Mark Gladden is the sole proprietor of a digital asset mining and trading business in New Mexico.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's Crypto and Taxes 2018 series.      Benjamin Franklin's 1789 axiom that ""in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes"" is a pragmatic truth. It deals with what “is."" We all pass on, and we all pay our dues.  These days most citizens are accustomed to the idea that – however much we dread it – paying taxes is as much a guarantee in life as the conclusion of life itself. It represents the outcome of the legislative process, in which elected leaders draft bills which ultimately become law.  Institutions like the Internal Revenue Service are then tasked with enforcing these laws, but they do not create tax law themselves, nor do they make decisions regarding tax expenditures.  Above all, they do not care if a taxpayer disagrees with the law because it’s not their responsibility to create or amend legislation. They collect and enforce – period.  Yet many cryptocurrency enthusiasts seem utterly dumbfounded by this, and are brazenly willing to risk the threat of a lifetime of recurring audits, massive fines which wipe out their capital gains, and even downright imprisonment – all for the sake of the wholly separate topic of how much tax “ought” to be collected and how those dollars “ought” to be spent.  Did Al Capone think he “ought” to pay less tax? Sure. Did it matter when the cell door slammed shut behind him? No.  What 'ought' to be  This second form of truth – what “ought” to be – is normative in nature, concerned with ideals, and inherently a messy subject with a myriad of factions all claiming to be right.  Some citizens want to pay no tax at all, presumably content to drag down their neighbors while imagining a world in which fires put themselves out, highways and bridges build themselves, and no armed forces are required to prevent foreign invasion because everyone will sing each other to sleep at night.  Others want the rich taxed so heavily that anyone with an ounce of gumption decides it’s a waste of time growing a business, and a presumably endless spigot of tax dollars will magically pay for everyone to go hiking seven days a week before watching the latest episode of ""Game of Thrones"" on free satellite internet beamed into their free tiny home situated on a free lot on the peak of forever-free Mt. Utopia.  Clearly the truth is closer to the middle, and if there is indeed a middle ground where some amount of tax is necessary, then everyone who enjoys the benefits of tax expenditures – safety from invasion, use of transportation services and infrastructure, access to a robust legal system – must also pay their share.  That doesn’t mean we should accept a broken system if taxes are being used inappropriately. Far from it. We should fight with every available legal means to change it to better serve our collective interests.  Being active in political campaigns, calling representatives, sending articles to news outlets, and joining active campaigns designed to force politicians to live up to their promises – all of these are among the freedoms which every citizen of a democracy enjoys.  Yet how many of people actually do the legwork before complaining about the status quo, then rationalizing their decision to hide income?  Facing reality  Most citizens are inflamed by ultra-rich politicians and businessmen who are found to have hidden millions in offshore accounts, and similarly the crypto community should raise a skeptical eye at those who claim they are hiding income because the world is not what it “ought” to be. Deal with the reality of what “is,” then set about changing things to how they “ought” to be.  Even if you vehemently advocate for hiding income, at very least do yourself a favor and research just how many clever tax cheats have been caught, fined, or jailed years later when old technology was proven vulnerable and exploited by weaknesses that new tech uncovered.  Every action you perform online, from bank deposits, purchases, and email exchanges – all of it, including all activity on most of the major crypto exchanges – is now or may soon be available to your government’s tax enforcement institution. Some government agencies have even been reported to wholesale track all internet data, going so far as to store all encrypted traffic until future technology renders it vulnerable.  Do you really want to risk everything when the alternative is to simply do your best and provide a good faith reporting of your capital gains and mining income for this year or any previous year you’ve missed?  Sure, you’ll pay somewhere between 0% and 39.6%, but that still leaves you with 100% to 60.4% of secure, guaranteed income, possibly more if you make use of all available deductions and depreciation expenses.  Deal with what “is” by reporting your income and paying your taxes, then deal with what “ought” to be by getting involved and advocating for changes to tax law and expenditures.  You’ll sleep easier at night by remembering Franklin’s maxim about death and taxes.

In 1987's Black Monday stock market crash, Sam Walton, the world's richest man, lost more than half a billion dollars in a few hours.  When reached for comment, Walton said, ""It’s paper anyway. As far as I’m concerned we’re focusing totally on the company doing well and taking care of our customers.”  He didn’t care about dollars; he cared about his asset Wal-Mart, and he still owned that.  History of the #HODL  In bitcoin’s volatile and roller coaster past, “HODL” was the meme that bound the cryptocurrency community together. It stood for the proposition that we all believe in the future of bitcoin. It’s both funny and insightful.  Here is the original post by GameKyuubi on a Bitcoin Talk forum (spelling errors and profanity included):    I AM HODLING      I type d that tyitle twice because I knew it was wrong the first time. Still wrong. w/e. GF's out at a lesbian bar, BTC crashing WHY AM I HOLDING? I'LL TELL YOU WHY. It's because I'm a bad trader and I KNOW I'M A BAD TRADER. Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro. Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what? I'm not part of that group. When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~! Those taunt threads saying ""OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD"" YEAH NO SHIT. NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD. I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU. You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob. The people inbetween hold. In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.    so i've had some whiskey    actually on the bottle it's spelled whisky    w/e    sue me    (But only if it's payable in BTC)    It was not about bitcoin versus bitcoin cash or 1,000 other cryptocurrencies. It was bitcoin vs. the world and we ALL embraced it.  It only took 11 minutes for this post to become a meme that became the rallying cry for the entire crypto world. We were all on the same rollercoaster ride and GameKyuubi, in the depths of his frustration, had (sort of) elegantly articulated both what it feels like and the best trading strategy for an asset this volatile.  Buy and HODL.  The good traders  GameKyuubi was wrong about only one thing: There aren’t any good traders.  There are lots of us who believe we are good traders. But we aren’t. Of course, some of the loudest voices on Reddit regularly remind us about how well they time the market. Except when they don’t time the market well.  A paper published last October by the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley entitled “Do Day Traders Rationally Learn About Their Ability?” used nearly 15 years of stock market day trading data to conclude that all day traders are irrational, the vast majority of day traders lose money, and even when day traders are successful, they ""irrationally attribute success disproportionately to their ability rather than luck.""  This sounds exactly like the crypto trader. Any post you see mocking HODL is likely someone who thinks they are really smart because they made money by trading crypto last year.  Of course, their success was due to their unique trading ability and not the fact that the entire market rose like a rocket.  HODLing works  Still, empirically, even in volatile assets like bitcoin, carefully choosing an asset and holding long-term positions has proven to offer the best return.  Warren Buffett, the most successful investor of modern times, has often said that he only invests in what he knows. His preferred holding period: forever. With that model, his company, Berkshire Hathaway, has averaged a 19 percent annual return since 1965 which means it has risen more than 1 million percent.  Theoretical models that assume participants know when markets will move against them can offer better returns but, in practice, market movements cannot be reliably predicted so even when people like Bernie Madoff try to make us think that they’ve figured it out, they haven’t.  Long-term investment in quality assets remains the only reliable investment strategy.  Simply put, HODLing works.  More possibilities  For those not interested in limiting their activity to HODLing, there are two new and useful ideas that have begun bouncing around that really do advance cryptocurrencies: #BUIDL and #SPEDN.  BUIDL has been used to help remind us that, in the words of a CypherPunk’s Manifesto, “Cypherpunks write code.” In order for the blockchain to really be useful and valuable, we need to build stuff on it. Watching the price go up and down either as a trader or a HODLer does nothing to make bitcoin work better.  We need to create some of the promised applications that can really change the world. To date, the blockchain community has fallen short in this regard outside of the areas of payments but there are some real wins.  Just this weekend, Voatz, a Medici Ventures portfolio company is running party county convention voting in Utah, state convention voting in Michigan and state primary voting for overseas and military voters in West Virginia, all on a blockchain platform.  Blockchain voting is a simple application, but it is one that can bring a much-needed security and transparency to elections. And we are doing it now.  SPEDN is a nod to the many of us who realize that, for bitcoin to be useful, we need to be able to spend it to buy things. And I mean everything. It really doesn’t matter whether it is through second-layer solutions like lightning or forks like bitcoin cash; we need more ways to use cryptocurrencies in real-world transactions.  A focus here, rather than complaining about HODLers would be helpful. We need many more merchants to accept cryptocurrency before it becomes useful. Options to spend bitcoin remain severely limited in most areas and this will ultimately limit bitcoin’s value.  As for me, I will HODL until I can buy useful stuff and SPEDN.  HODL on  This year has seen intense regulatory pressure on cryptocurrencies and its time we stop pretending that HODL was stupid. It isn’t and it wasn’t. Anyone who doesn't like the HODL mentality needs to give HODLers something else they can do with their bitcoins.  Trading is no solution for intelligent people. What we need are new ways to use cryptocurrency.  We need BUIDLers and merchants who will let us be SPEDNers.

42380568,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gSBH,1523845844,Mastercard Eyes Blockchain for Fighting Fake Identities,"A newly published patent filing from Mastercard suggests that the payments giant is looking at blockchain as a way to safeguard identity data.  In an application released by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) last Thursday, Mastercard describes a system in which a semi-private or private blockchain would be used to receive and store identity data, the pieces of which could include a ""name, a street address, tax identification number"" and more.  The company states in the filing, which was originally submitted in September 2017, that the tech could help it block the use of fake identity data within its systems.  Mastercard writes:  ""The use of a blockchain for the storage of identity and credential data may provide for an immutable storage of such data that can provide an accurate verification thereof and also prevent the fabrication of such data.""  The filing explains that the system would generate a ""data file"" for each entity, which would be associated with a public key and a ""geographic jurisdiction."" These entities would be ""subordinate,"" while a ""superior"" entity would impose a digital signature on their data files. A ""hashing module of the processing server"" would subsequently generate an ""identity value"" for each entity and create a block with a timestamp and a record of the most recent block added to the blockchain.  Unlike a public blockchain, Mastercard's proposed network would only allow certain nodes to submit data. These authorized nodes would act to ""prevent the addition of data that may compromise the accuracy of the data stored therein,"" per to the application.  Put more simply, the Mastercard-approved nodes are the only ones that can update the identity information within the system. And according to Mastercard, the proposed system could possibly replace other means of proving identity that may be susceptible to fabrication and inaccuracies.  As the company notes:  ""In such instances, it may be difficult for an entity to disprove a false identity, leading to an interaction with an inauthentic individual or entity. Thus, there is a need for a technical solution to provide for the immutable storage of identity and credential data that may prevent fabrication and inaccuracies.""  Mastercard has submitted several blockchain-related patent applications to date. One filing envisioned an infrastructure that could facilitate refund services for cryptocurrency users. Another filing described a blockchain-based database that could instantaneously process payments, thus significantly reducing transaction settlement times.  In addition to the intellectual property plays, Mastercard is moving to beef up its internal blockchain talent as well.  The payments tech company announced last week that it was hiring 175 new technology developers, including blockchain specialists, to work out of an office in Ireland.

42421802,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXtoyr,1523842245,A Bitcoin Rally After Tax Day? Don't Bet the Farm On It,"Tanzeel Akhtar is an independent British journalist whose work has been published in the Wall Street Journal, CNBC, FT Alphaville, Investing.com, Forbes, Euromoney and Citywire.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's Crypto and Taxes 2018 series.      When tax season ends, will the crypto bear market end with it?  Certainly, with the April 17 U.S. deadline to file approaching, there’s much speculation that the crypto winter of 2018 was largely due to investors frantically selling to raise funds so they could pay taxes on 2017 gains.  “We may look back on this time as the ‘Crypto Tax Crisis of 2018,’ as thanks to tax liabilities we’re witnessing the most concentrated period of net fiat outflows that the crypto asset ecosystem has experienced in its short life,” Chris Burniske, a partner at Placeholder VC, and Jonathan Cheesman wrote in a recent, highly detailed Medium post.  And there has almost certainly been some tax-related selling, judging from posts on Reddit and various cryptocurrency forums from investors who had cashed out cryptocurrency during the December run-up and became concerned about their tax liability.  “I didn't know this back then but it looks like I owe income taxes on those trades, which adds up to about $50,000 if I add up state (California) and federal,” a Redditor who goes by the handle of thoway wrote a month ago.  Further, Japan’s tax deadline was March 15th. Like, the U.S., Japan is a huge participant in the crypto market, so this would further support the thesis.  But there are several reasons to discount the contribution of such selling to the recent market rout – and thus the probability that prices will suddenly surge again after Tax Day.  First of all, investors who sold during the slump would not likely have raised enough to cover their tax liability. Perry Woodin, Chief Strategy Officer at HashChain Technology, Inc, did the math.  “Imagine an individual who purchased 1.5 bitcoins in January of 2017 for $1,200 a bitcoin,” Woodin told CoinDesk. “If that individual sold one bitcoin in December of 2017 they could have realized a gain of ~$18,000. This short term gain is taxed as ordinary income in the U.S. Assuming a tax rate of ~30 percent, the tax liability would be about $5,400.”  As we spoke in early April, bitcoin was trading around $6,700. Hence, Woodin said, in his hypothetical example, “the remaining 0.5 bitcoin (or $3,350) is not enough to pay the $5,400 tax liability.”  So, tax-driven selling would have been irrational. Of course, people don’t always behave rationally.  Trevor Gerszt, CEO of CoinIRA, a company that specializes in digital currency individual retirement accounts (IRAs), gave another reason to doubt a strong connection between the crypto slump and tax selling. He pointed to the recent activity on the bitcoin blockchain, or lack thereof.  ”If tax selling were really a driver of bitcoin prices, we would expect to see a spike in selling, yet confirmed transactions have been relatively low and have remained that way for the past two months,” Gerszt said on Tuesday.  To be sure, major exchanges started batching transactions in the first quarter, so the number of liquidations reflected on the public ledger might be understated.  Eric Ervin, CEO of Reality Shares, which has launched an exchange traded fund (ETF) investing in blockchain technology, said taxes were certainly a factor in the performance of crypto, but not the primary one, as evidenced by the timing of the dips.  “The market selloff began in December, first bottoming in February, and now we are retesting the lows we saw in February,” Ervin said Tuesday.  There’s no point in trying to sell your crypto holdings in a panic just because Uncle Sam is knocking on your door. If worse comes to worse, you will have to work with the IRS, set up a payment plan and then hope for a recovery in crypto markets.  And if you’re going to buy in anticipation of a recovery, don’t hold your breath for it to happen right after Tax Day.
