42378844,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mExN,1475254675,Would a Deutsche Bank Collapse Impact Bitcoin Prices?,"The pressure is building for Deutsche Bank. Germany's largest and most financially leveraged bank continues to see its stock price languish as other firms distance themselves from the beleaguered financial institution.  Indications that the bank may pay billions of dollars to the US government in order to settle charges related to mortgage lending practices have sent markets reeling amidst an environment already on the edge.  Should the bank fail, it could have devastating implications for the financial services industry.  And, since market participants have often flocked to bitcoin in times of market distress, turmoil of this magnitude could prove highly bullish for the digital currency.  ""The capital markets have awakened to bitcoin as a disaster hedge,"" analyst Chris Burniske told CoinDesk. The digital currency doesn’t correlate with other asset classes, an aspect that may make it more attractive in times of uncertainty, said Burniske, blockchain products lead for investment manager ARK Invest.  ""Depending on how people feel about Deutsche Bank's future prospects, they may choose to hedge themselves from the more traditional markets by using bitcoin,"" he went on to say.  Potential bailout  Safe haven assets like bitcoin may come in handy soon enough, as Deutsche Bank's rapidly deteriorating situation has many wondering whether the financial institution will need a bailout from the German government or the European Central Bank.  The company has been been on rocky ground for some time, and if they don’t do something to fix it, Deutsche Bank could go belly up, economist Chris Martenson told CoinDesk.  ""The DOJ is coming after them for $14b, and if they pay even $3b or $4b, it will still be too much for them to bear,"" he said.  While securing a bailout may prove unpopular, the political pressure to make this happen could be enormous. Discussions involving the possibility of a obtaining such financial assistance intensified on 29th September, when certain hedge funds cut their derivatives exposure to Deutsche Bank and the major financial institution’s shares fell more than 6.5%, CNBC reported.  Deutsche Bank would go on to release a statement assuring global market participants of its financial stability, but the numbers remain a grim reminder about the hurdles the bank faces.  It has roughly $16b in equity compared to $160b in debt, according to a separate CNBC report. Company shares have dropped upwards of 70% since July 2015, falling from a highly of roughly $35 to approximately $11.50 on September 29, Google Finance data reveals.  Possible ‘global contagion’  Should the organization’s financial position continue to deteriorate, a failure to secure a bailout could ""spark global contagion,"" stated Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX. More specifically, a situation of unchecked financial weakness could result in numerous consequences, including depositor flight and the collapse of credit lines, he told CoinDesk.  Deutsche Bank is the largest derivatives counterparty in the world. The financial institution has been offloading some of these contracts, selling roughly two-thirds of a portfolio of uncleared credit default swaps.  Because Deutsche Bank has derivatives contracts with so many institutions, any bank it owes money to will be affected, noted Hayes. While the magnitude of the fallout from Deutsche Bank’s failure remains unknown until it happens, contagion could result in central banks around the world being forces to shore up vulnerable financial institutions.  Market expert Petar Zivkovksi told CoinDesk that, should Deutsche Bank fail, it could impact “dozens of systemically important banks around Europe and the globe.” He also spoke to the key role played by the DOJ fine, emphasizing that the final amount Deutsche Bank would pay was thus far undetermined.  ""The US justice department fine tipped the situation into a crisis, although recent news indicates that fine may be reduced to allow Deutsche Bank to find a way to restructure and save itself,"" said Zivkovksi, director of operations for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, highlighting the reluctance thus far of the German government to step in.  Impact on bitcoin  Bitcoin’s price and volatility could be impacted by the Deutsche Bank situation, depending on how the situation plays out – and how markets react accordingly.  Volatility was been very low in September, with The BitMEX 30 day Historical Volatility Index measuring 24.72% during the first 29 days of the month, down from 49.97% in August and 69.42% in July.  ""Bitcoin prices may be impacted as the situation unfolds, but I believe only an extremely negative resolution, such as a domino-effect euro bank failure, could bring high volatility back to BTC prices,"" Zivkovski speculated, adding that it would take an extreme case scenario to spark a major flight to cryptocurrencies.  “The world is not quite ready yet to pour large amounts into cryptocurrencies in times of fiat distress,"" he added.  Hayes offered a different point of view, asserting that central banks will engage in robust money printing whether Deutsche Bank receives a bailout or not.  Any such money printing will provide tailwinds for bitcoin and “result in more financial repression as central banks once again must prevent assets from fleeing the banking system"", he said – a situation that might ultimately favor currencies like bitcoin.

42378858,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mEsL,1475249607,Bitcoin Unlimited Announces Research Grant Program,"The team behind a long-contentious proposal to upgrade the bitcoin protocol has announced it is making new funding available for research.  In a blog post today, the Bitcoin Unlimited team revealed it has ""several hundred thousand"" dollars available to fund work it believes will help restore ""Satoshi’s vision"" for a global peer-to-peer digital cash system.  The statements reflect criticisms of Bitcoin Core, the protocol's dominant development team, who have pushed to implement top-level networks that extend bitcoin's functionality without altering its current blockchain rules. Bitcoin Unlimited, by contrast, promotes the idea of on-chain scaling that would boost the number of transactions that could be settled directly on the blockchain, but bring additional consensus changes.  Areas where Bitcoin Unlimited is seeking submissions include longer-term scaling initiatives; incremental scaling improvements; empirical studies; quality control; and outreach.  Additional details about the application process can be found here.

42378859,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mFCT,1475240410,Here's A First Look at Thomson Reuters's New Ethereum Identity Tools,"Thomson Reuters has revealed it will soon launch an identity verification platform for ethereum smart contract developers.  Conceived as part of the mass media company's recent ethereum ""hackethons"", the tools will be available in beta via the BlockOne ID website starting next week. The goal, as explained by Thomson Reuters, is to allow developers to limit the use of decentralized applications (""dapps"") to users who accept the terms and conditions, making it easier to comply with common regulatory requirements, for example.  Thomson Reuters head of engineering, applied innovation, Richard Collin, explained that BlockOneID combines standard authentication practices with the blockchain.  Collin told CoinDesk:  ""Is this user entitled to use me? We can tell them 'yes' or 'no', without them having to go off the blockchain.”  Collin compared the process to logging into eBay (or any standard web application) and accepting the terms and conditions, except in this case, the tools could be for any dapp where creators need a user to accept the terms to participate.  While it's an experimental project (Thomson Reuters isn't yet looking to monetize it), Collin said that it aligns with the company's existing media and data delivery products. He cited other examples where Thomson Reuters provides a service by identifying users are before serving them content, for example, with stock prices or other data feeds.  As of next Monday, the tools will be available on Morden, the official ethereum testnet. But Collin said the company has plans to one day deploy it on the public network.  'Register a dapp'  To begin, developers can use BlockOneID to ""Register a dapp"" by providing details such as a unique ID and a logo.  When setting up the dApp, developers specify the terms that users need to meet in order to use a smart contract, then BlockOne ID interacts with ethereum under the hood.  ""We'll place a smart contract on the blockchain, which we will populate with the users that have gone through your terms and conditions,"" Collin said.  The smart contract, he added, will contain all addresses that are allowed to use the app.  ""In other words, totally anonymous users who've just rocked up with a keypair and some ether won't be able to (ab)use your DApp,"" the documentation explains.  Collin argued that this is something developers have historically had trouble with. ""They didn't know who was using their smart contracts. They couldn’t show they had done any diligence,"" Collin said, suggested that the failure of the big ethereum project, The DAO, was one example of this.  He offered a use case:  ""Imagine I [have] a smart contract that accepts money for investing. I could limit the investors or people who have logged in through Facebook and my contract would only speak to those users.”  User perspective  Once a dapp is registered on BlockOne ID, it's available to users who accept the conditions.  That's where BlockOne ID’s hosted ethereum wallet comes in. It’s a hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet, where users can back up several private keys with a single ""seed"", or passphrase composed of random words. The secure wallet structure is linked to a traditional OAuth 2.0 identity.  Users can verify their identity by signing up or logging in through OAuth using Google, Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter, a familiar process for verifying identity, highlighting the company's effort to build a user-friendly interface.  Once registered, users can login and accept the terms and agreements of using the app.  At a more technical level, Collin explained that BlockOneID combines standard ways of authentication with the blockchain:  ""The whole idea is we have existing systems that provide identity for us, based on standard protocols like OAuth2. Here we combine those with a wallet to access the blockchain.""  But, Thomson Reuters won't have access to a user’s private keys or passwords and are unable to act on a user’s behalf, according to Collin.  A user still needs ether to pay the user fees on the network, required by all decentralized applications on the network. Although an ether balance is required, Collin said that the goal is a user-friendly service where users might not even realize that what they're using is a blockchain app.  Moving forward, Collin said they’re working on some tweaks to the user experience and other methods of confirming a member’s identity.  ""I think that one of the areas we can develop is KYC and developing more interesting and trusted user identities.""

42378843,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mEw7,1475235905,The Case Against Editable Blockchains,"Brian Kelly is an investor and financial markets commentator, founder and CEO of BKCM LLC and one of the founders of PAR, a blockchain-based hedge fund administration system.  In this opinion piece, Kelly argues that making blockchains editable allows users to rewrite history, therefore opening up financial systems to the potential for fraud.  A once-in-a-generation opportunity to upgrade our defenses against financial fraud is under attack. The immutable ledger, at the heart of bitcoin and blockchain technology, prevents bad actors from changing the record.  Accenture has patented a new type of blockchain that allows pre-selected parties with access to the ledger to edit entries, claiming its prototype will be more attractive because it will allow information to be changed or deleted.  Bitcoin and its technological innovation – a blockchain – have been heralded as the cure for what ails our antiquated financial infrastructure. I believe that the immutability of a blockchain is a key feature and strength in the technology.  Allowing anyone to amend or delete information from the ledger threatens our ability to fight improprieties with the game changing blockchain technology.  The importance of permanence  Since 2009, there have been more than 155 million bitcoin transactions. Every single one is permanently stored on bitcoin's ledger.  Every time a slice of pizza has been bought or hotel room has been booked on Expedia with bitcoin, a permanent record of the transaction is stored. Don't worry, none of the specific details – like how many slices of pizza you bought – are stored forever, just the record that a transaction took place and that value was exchanged.  Richard Lumb, Accenture's group chief executive for financial services recently wrote:  ""That permanence has been vital in building trust in the decentralized currencies, which are used by millions of people … The financial services industry needs to face the question of how to balance the appeal of pristine accounting with the demands of the real world, where some things simply need to be struck from the records.""  These two statements are at fundamental odds with each other and highlight the exact reason bitcoin was created. The moment you allow someone to change the record you begin to erode trust. While the change may be for the most benign reasons, like human error, it invariably opens the door to the erosion of trust.  The foreign currency markets provide numerous examples of what can happen once trust becomes corroded. From 1975 to 2007 – the post-Bretton Woods period when foreign currencies were set free to float with only the promise of a sovereign backing – there have been 201 currency crises globally.  What's even more striking is that over a nine-month period in 2008-2009, 23 countries experienced currency depreciations of 25% of more – the accepted definition of a currency crisis. The proximate cause of this cluster of crises was a loss of trust.  Bitcoin emerged from the rubble of the Great Financial Crisis as an answer to the loss of trust. The innovation of bitcoin and the blockchain is that it is a system that does not require trust to operate.  Upgrading the system  In order to achieve this state of trustable grace its underlying record of transactions must be immutable.  We need this technology to upgrade our aging traditional financial infrastructure. In fact, in the recently released paper, the World Economic Forum concluded:  ""Distributed ledger technology (blockchain) has the potential to drive simplicity and efficiency by establishing new financial services infrastructure and processes.""  The need for an upgrade to our existing financial plumbing is indisputable and the immutable blockchain is an integral part of this advancement.  A blockchain is a tool – like a hammer – sometimes you need a sledge hammer and other times you need a rubber mallet. There are ways that the prerequisite of permanence can be reconciled with the ""demands of the real world"".  For example, at BKCM we are using blockchain technology as a tool to build our PAR System – a disruptive hedge fund administration system.  We recognized that a blockchain was the perfect tool to track inflows and outflows of money in capital pools. The proper accounting for investments in hedge funds is not something that you would want to be edited. It was the ability to change the permanent record that enabled Bernie Madoff to commit the largest fraud in financial history.  In my view, for blockchain technology to move beyond ""lab experiments"", it is critical that we embrace the features of immutability and use the tool for its intended purpose.  A blockchain is a great way to keep a record that you don't ever want changed – this is the heart and soul of a trustless system – it is a feature, not a flaw.
