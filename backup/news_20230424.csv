12076089,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4596132-bitcoin-miners-flying-but-where-hut-eight-going?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1682380372,"The Bitcoin Miners Are Flying, But Where Is Hut 8 Going?","Summary Does Hut 8 intend to continue as a Bitcoin miner? Or is it diversifying and morphing into something else? Five crypto miners are up more than 200% YTD; Hut is up 120% but its mining capacity is in trouble. The next earnings call has essential questions to answer and should provide further evidence about their plans for the future. The surge in the valuation of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miners, fuelled by a recovery in Bitcoin price, got me searching the Crypto Miners Sector for a short–medium-term trade in this super volatile sector. In my last article, I looked at the industry, discussed the crypto winter and the increase in the valuations of Miners. I analyzed HIVE Blockchain Technologies ( HIVE ) in detail, ultimately deciding to pass and continue searching. Perhaps Hut 8 Mining Corp. ( HUT ) is the Miner I am looking for. Hut managed the 2022 Crypto Winter quite pretty well (this is the same graph I used to compare several Miners in the previous article) Hut debt v equity over time (Author database) Its cash level is higher than its debt, which has not increased significantly. Until recently, Hut kept its Bitcoin as an asset and funded operations by diluting shareholders, almost 30%, in 2022. The company is 85% owned by the general public and has practically zero institutional investment. (Bitfury owns 4%). Hut had 9,000 Bitcoins on its balance sheet at the end of 2022. Hut is changing Hut looks to be in the middle of a significant business pivot. The production of Bitcoin is dropping and might be more of a secondary business line in the future. M&A activity is driving the change; Hut bought TerraGo Inc's data center s and will merge with U.S. Bitcoin in Q2 2023, a merger of equals, we are told. The Pivot away from mining The actual production of Bitcoins from the mining operation is falling precipitously. In March, they produced 131 coins, down from 156 in February, continuing the trend from last year in Q4 2022; Hut averaged 232 Bitcoins monthly. Bitcoin mining is far more profitable now than in 2022, so we should see increased production. Many miners throttled back production in 2022 as the business became unprofitable (the cost of electricity needed was greater than the price of Bitcoins mined). However, the Bitcoin price is currently up, and electricity prices have steadied. The reasons for the drop in production at Hut must be more fundamental. Hut has three mining sites (Medicine Hat, North Bay, and Drumheller), all based in Canada. Only one of them appears to be fully operational. North Bay is closed completely. From the Q4 2022 Earnings call ... dispute with Validus related to our North Bay mining facility, where we stopped mining in mid-November Validus is the energy supplier to the site and has cut off the electricity supply. Legal action is taking place over the dispute between the two companies. Management has not given a timeframe for restarting production. In the Q4 earnings call, we learned that 1,000 of the nearly 9,000 miners at the site had been moved from North Bay to Medicine Hat. The remaining 7,800 miners have been stored as Hut has no premises to house them. Seven thousand eight hundred miners in storage is a waste. It is not a good situation. The second site, Drumheller, is running well below capacity due to electrical issues. In the earnings call, CFO Shenif Visram implied that, as yet, no plan to solve these problems exists. He said the next earnings call might be when he can give an update (an answer to a question from George Sutton in the earnings call). The Third Site Medicine Hat appears to be fully operational ; it hit an all-time high, thanks to the extra 1,000 miners moved from the North Bay site, operating at 1.7 Exahash in March. To put this into context, Riot Platforms Inc. ( RIOT ) is running at 9.8 Exahash. It is unclear if Hut will reverse this drop in mining; it could be temporary, and perhaps all the miners will be back fully powered soon, or perhaps Hut is looking at other avenues and is less concerned with being a Bitcoin miner. High-Performance Computing High-p erformance computing is a significant and fast-growing market, forecast to be at $49.9 bil lion by 2027, the customer base is small and medium size companies, and currently, there is insufficient supply to meet growing demand. Hut entered this market when it bought five data centers from TerraGo Inc . in January 2022. The deal included 36,000 square feet of data center space with room for expansion at one site, all 400 customers, 30 employees, and the business's products. December 2022 report (Hut 8 website) High-performance computing had a turnover of $4.5 million in Q4 2022, which is $1.5 million monthly and will likely be a regularly recurring income. Any growth here will represent new customers and be a good sign. It would appear to be a hugely profitable business with revenue of $16.9 million, costs of $8.4 million, and depreciation of $5 million. 50% gross margin is an outstanding result. In the earnings call, management was asked about this sector and said Jaime Leverton I can't give you any forward looking guidance. But what I can say is, we are very pleased that we did that acquisition. It's been just over a year since we diversified into that area and then ultimately we're able to not just integrate the business, but spent a significant amount of time focusing on upgrading that business. So I think we've timed the market incredibly well and we continue to be bullish on the space and really thrilled that we're a bit ahead of the curve on that diversification strategy. We've got an incredible sales team in place that's actively driving expansion of the pipeline. But I don't know how to get into more specific details with you. We do have some expansion capabilities remaining in a few of the sites, not all five are expandable. But we'll continue to look to expand as required when the capacity that we have built out already is filled up. So it's really a data center by data center question as opposed to a fleet demand question. I will watch the performance closely in the next earnings (May). $5 million in revenue would be an excellent result. I will also be listening for clues about how this business will progress. If the focus is moving away from Bitcoin mining, then this high-margin operation is an excellent one to focus on and grow. Diversification is a word that keeps cropping up from Hut management. U.S. Bitcoin a merger of Equals Last year Hut announced its intention to merge with the private company U.S. Bitcoin Corp. The CEO said it is a chance to leverage the Bitcoin stack they have hodled, which is a big departure from the normal Hut mode of operation. They have always kept the Bitcoin they mine but will use it in this merger. Is that another sign of a change of direction? The rationale for the deal is important; in the earnings call, the CEO gave an overview. He explained that the combined group would be a highly diversified U.S. domiciled organization with self-mining operations at three mines in the U.S. and two in Canada. They will have six exahash of hosting capacity (for the use of other miners) and have some of the largest miners as clients. A different business line will be managed infrastructure operations; he said they would look after the optimization of miners as well as property management and maintenance. The customer would be the site's owner, and the new Hut would be paid a monthly amount to manage the facility; the owner would receive the mined Bitcoin. That gives four business lines, high-performance computing, hosting Mining operations, managing mining facilities, and finally, self-mining Bitcoin. Where will the focus be going forward? Is it a good deal? The shareholders of each company will own 50% of the new entity (called Hut 8 Corp.). USBTC has been through 5 rounds of funding, but Finding any financial details on the company isn't easy. The last two funding rounds are shown. USBTC funding rounds (CB insights) To make sense for Hut shareholders, the new entity must be worth double what Hut is now, about $850 million. Does it make sense? I am not convinced. The Current U.S. Bitcoin Corp Business The main body of the USBTC business was acquired from the Compute North bankruptcy. A quick review of the bankruptcy . Feb 2022 Generate Capital loans Compute North $300 million to develop 400mw of mining facilities at two sites in Texas. July 2022 Generate Capital asserts technical defaults September 2022 Compute North goes into Chapter 11 unable to service its debts November 2022 Generate Capital bought the facilities (built with the original loan) for $5 million; Generate was the only bidder. USBTC has three different businesses; it is a Bitcoin miner, manages the Bitcoin mining sites owned by Generate Capital, and manages a site it bought in the Compute North bankruptcy. USBTC self-mines at its Niagara Falls site: a 1.1 maximum exahash site mired in controversy over noise pollution . It has had to pay a $1 million fine and install noise reduction dampening and an independent noise monitor. $150,000 in compliance fees may also be due. It is not yet clear if the Niagara site is fully operational again, mining has re-started, but no mining figures have been released so far. USBTC owns and operates the King Mountain mining site in Texas: acquired from the bankrupted Compute North. Marathon Digital ( MARA ) have miners at this site, and they were one of Compute North's largest customers. The bulk of MARA's miners are at this facility . It is unclear how much free capacity is at this site and how much self-mining USBTC does there. USBTC manages the sites that Generate Capital bought out of bankruptcy, totaling 400MW. It is unclear who owns the miners at these facilities or how much spare capacity there is. U.S. Mining Infrastructure Operations USMIO is the USBTC division managing Bitcoin mining sites. It manages the Kearny sites for Generate Capital and believes that this model can drive future revenue that will not depend on the price of Bitcoin. As yet, we have not been given enough information to make an informed decision on USBTC, its management of facilities is the same business Compute North was doing and at the same sites. What is USBTC doing to make this more profitable? Earnings call May 2023 For me to invest in Hut, I need clarity. I need answers to the following questions. 1. What will be the focus going forward, and how much growth can we expect in each business line? Bitcoin mining, hosting, managed facilities, and high-performance computing. I want to see some clear guidance. 2. What is the plan for the 7,800 miners in storage? 3. What is the plan to solve the electrical problems, and what is the Drumheller site's timeline? 4. Why is US Bitcoin Corp worth the same as Hut 8? It has a much smaller mining operation, we do not know its financial position, and we have no information about the income it generates from its hosting business or its facilities management. Conclusion I cannot invest in Hut 8 stock yet; there are too many unknowns, and the next earnings call will be very important. I like the high-performance computing business but have no idea what the plan is, and so far, management has declined to give forward guidance. I like the look of Bitcoin Mining in 2023, but I am unclear about the capacity Hut will have and, as a result, can not make any projections about income. I might like the facilities management business, but Hut must give me some figures to work with. If we get answers, I will update following the next earnings call.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4596132-bitcoin-miners-flying-but-where-hut-eight-going?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12076089.jpeg
42393734,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj2lmP,1682380259,Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade Brings Record Inflow of 572K ETH Staked in a Week,"Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade brought a record-breaking weekly inflow of ether (ETH) deposits for staking last week, mainly driven by institutional staking service providers and investors reinvesting rewards after withdrawal, crypto analysts said.  Investors deposited some 571,950 ETH tokens into staking contracts, worth more than $1 billion, according to a Dune Analytics data dashboard created by Tom Wan, an analyst of digital asset investment firm 21Shares.  This was the largest weekly token inflow in ether staking’s almost two-and-a-half-year history, per blockchain data provided by 21Shares.  The Ethereum blockchain completed its highly anticipated tech upgrade, often called Shanghai or Shapella, on April 12. The initiative enabled the withdrawal of tokens previously locked-up in staking contracts for the first time. It was the last key step after last year’s Merge to complete the network’s transition to validating transactions through staking from a mining-based system.  ETH, the network’s native token and the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after bitcoin (BTC), surged following the successful implementation of the upgrade, but relinquished all its gains last week in a broader crypto market sell-off, caused mostly by macroeconomic concerns about inflation and a looming recession.  Institutional ETH staking  Institutional staking services drove the deposit surge in ETH staking, Wan tweeted.  Since the Shanghai upgrade went live the top five institutional-grade staking service providers – Bitcoin Suisse, Figment, Kiln, Staked.us and Stakefish – staked a total of 235,330 ETH combined, worth some $450 million, according to 21Shares’ Dune dashboard.  CoinDesk reported last week that the Shanghai upgrade boosted demand for ETH staking among institutional investors, including traditional finance (TradFi) firms.  The increased interest also highlights that enabling withdrawals from Ethereum’s proof-of-stake chain has significantly reduced the liquidity risk associated with locking up tokens, Wan added in a separate tweet.  Restaking rewards  Another likely catalyst for the record inflow has been investors choosing to reinvest their previously earned and withdrawn rewards from staking, Anders Helseth, vice president of digital asset market research firm K33 Research, explained in an emailed note.  Through the first eight days after the upgrade, investors withdrew some 900,000 ETH in staking rewards. Meanwhile, staking deposits totaled some 667,000 tokens, which was six times larger than the amount deposited during the last eight days before allowing withdrawals.  The dynamic indicates that investors decided to restake a large part of the withdrawn rewards, Helseth wrote.  Reduced selling pressure  The Shanghai upgrade was a “net positive” in terms of total staking inflows, Noelle Acheson, a market analyst and former head of research at Genesis Trading and CoinDesk (both subsidiaries of Digital Currency Group), wrote in a newsletter Monday.  “So far, the rhythm of new deposits has exceeded the amount leaving the network, if rewards can be excluded,” she said.  The reason for differentiating reward withdrawals from full exits comes from how Ethereum’s staking system works. Individual stakers or staking services have to lock up exactly 32 ETH to open a node and earn rewards for securing the network. Keeping the accrued rewards in the validator node does not improve the node’s return. Acheson explained that it’s logical for stakers to withdraw rewards, bundle the tokens and establish new nodes to increase potential returns.  “It seems this is what is happening,” she said. “Overall net inflow has been positive, which suggests that a significant portion of these rewards are being restaked.”  The trend of reinvesting rewards is also potentially a positive sign for ETH price as it reduces sell pressure, according to Acheson, “which is likely to end up being much less than many feared.“",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | RESEARCH,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/24/ethereum-shanghai-upgrade-brings-record-inflow-of-572k-eth-staked-in-a-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/14e5603b9f69ea53966ed1d0eb2d4d4a0659b25c-1936x1210.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company has diversified geographically, de-risking its China exposure. The global Bitcoin mining machine market size will grow at a CAGR of 12.6% from 2022 to 2031. My end-of-year price target of $15.20 on the stock is based on a forward PE assumption of 8x applied to the CY2024 earning estimate of $1.90. Thesis Canaan Inc. ( CAN ) designs supercomputing solutions for the Bitcoin mining industry and AI chips. Established in 2013, CAN is the second-largest company globally, in terms of computing power sold, for designing and producing Bitcoin mining machines after its competitor Bitmain. CAN is also a leading company in the Chinese AI market, offering AI edge-computing solutions and chips. The global Bitcoin mining machine market size will grow at a CAGR of 12.6% from 2022 to 2031 to reach $1.7 billion by 2031, which presents an opportunity for CAN to develop new-generation Bitcoin mining machines and expand revenues. I remain bullish on the stock with an end-of-year price target of $15.20 based on a forward PE assumption of 8x applied to the CY2024 earning estimate of $1.90. Business Model: Blockchain And AI Canaan Inc. has built extensive expertise in manufacturing Bitcoin mining machines and designing ASIC chips, which forms a strong foundation for AI chip design in terms of technology and capital resources. The company generates revenue through two main channels: firstly, by developing ASIC design technology for both blockchain and AI segments, and secondly, by leveraging its leadership in the ASIC Bitcoin mining business to provide technical support and R&D resources for its AI business. In 2022, the blockchain segment accounted for 99% of CAN's revenue, while the AI segment contributed only 0.2%. Blockchain Business CAN sells mining rigs and related parts globally to Bitcoin mining companies and has also started booking sales from its own Bitcoin mining business since Q2 2021. The company's competitive pricing strategy allows it to strengthen its position in blockchain supercomputing solutions. In April 2022, CAN launched its latest mining rig, A1366, under the AvalonMiner brand. In 2022, CAN generated $633 million in revenue from its blockchain products, accounting for 99% of its total revenue. AI Business CAN's AI business, established in 2018, focuses on supplying edge AI chips to customers in China's AIOT industry. The company launched its newest mid- to high-end edge inference chip, Kendryte K510, with RISC-V architecture and a self-developed neural network accelerator in July 2021. CAN has developed an AI ecosystem that encompasses front-end design, product development, and service solutions since releasing its first 28nm edge AI chip K210 in 2018. In 2022, the AI business generated $1.4 million, accounting for 0.2% of total revenue. Canaan investor presentation The cryptocurrency mining ban introduced by China in 2021 led some mining machine manufacturers and miners to exit the domestic market. As a result, CAN shifted its resources overseas to reduce its China exposure through geographical diversification. In 2021, the company's overseas revenues accounted for 63% of its total revenue, indicating a successful move. However, CAN's revenue and net income are significantly impacted by the cyclical volatility of Bitcoin's price, which has been falling over the past 15 months. As the Bitcoin price is expected to remain weak throughout 2023, CAN's mining rig demand may also weaken. To diversify its revenue and use its inventory effectively in this market, CAN run its mining business, contributing approximately $31.7 million to total revenue in 2022 (about 5% of total revenue). ASIC Design Increasing Processing Power With the wider use of Bitcoin in various applications and markets, mining machine manufacturers have been investing in advanced node capabilities as ASIC chips improve product performance and decrease power consumption. In 2013, CAN introduced its first ASIC-based mining chip and has since launched several more under the AvalonMiner brand to enhance chip performance and reduce costs. CAN was the first company to achieve 7nm ASIC-based mining chip mass production with its A921 chip in 2018. The company has launched 15 ASIC-based mining machines, and the machines' power consumption has significantly decreased every year. Canaan Geographical Diversification Reducing China Risk In 2021, China imposed a ban on cryptocurrency mining, causing some miners and mining machine manufacturers to leave the domestic market. CAN, like other companies in the China cryptocurrency industry, responded by reallocating resources overseas. In 2019 and 2020, China accounted for a significant portion of CAN's revenue at 75% and 85%, respectively. However, before the ban was introduced, CAN had already begun exploring international markets and generating sales outside mainland China. In 2021, the company's sales contribution from mainland China decreased to 36% , while its overseas revenues increased to 63% of total revenue. To diversify its revenue streams, CAN operates its own Bitcoin mining business in Kazakhstan and plans to accelerate its blockchain segment sales in North America, Central and Southeast Asia, and Australia. The company has also established a new overseas headquarters and warehouse for mining rigs logistics management in Singapore and established new partnerships and customer service centers in North America. Outside China, there is a growing trend of regulating the cryptocurrency market. In Central Asia, for example, the Kazakhstan government has required cryptocurrency miners to register their operations and business data with authorities since May 4, 2022, and file the required information every quarter. New York is the first state in the US to ban blockchain technology infrastructure after the New York Senate set forth a two-year moratorium on PoW cryptocurrency mining operations run on a carbon-based power source on June 2, 2022. In May 2022, a Cyprus government official indicated that authorities in Nicosia have prepared legislation to regulate crypto assets, and it is likely to adopt legislation before Europe finalizes a common regulatory framework. In 2023, Australia also presented a bill to regulate digital assets. Despite the increased regulation worldwide, I believe complete restrictions on the cryptocurrency industry are unlikely to be enacted. As for CAN, the management is likely to retain a flexible approach to adjust its operating policies in response to market developments. Canaan Competitive Landscape CAN primarily operates in designing and developing ASIC chips for Bitcoin mining machines, which a few Chinese companies, including Bitmain, MicroBT, and CAN, dominate . The industry is highly concentrated due to significant entry barriers, such as high fixed costs, lengthy development time, and expertise in ASIC chip design. Intel Corporation ( INTC ) recently entered the market by launching its first ASIC-based mining machine in February 2022. In the edge AI chip segment, CAN faces competition from established fabless chip companies such as NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Horizon Robotics, Bitmain, Rockchip, and Cambricon Technologies. Valuation The market has been overly pessimistic on CAN, in my view, as the regulatory environment surrounding crypto remains uncertain, and BTC prices experiencing a significant downtrend over the past one year. At current levels, the stock is trading significantly lower than its tangible book value (market cap of $453 million and a tangible book value of $639 million), which I believe provides a significant margin of safety and a good opportunity for long-term investors. CAN’s financial performance remains overwhelmingly geared to the blockchain mining business on the top and bottom lines. While the current backdrop is challenging, I see the segment well positioned for a cyclical rebound in cryptocurrency mining. Moreover, I believe CAN’s edge AI and mining businesses are gaining traction, supported by its solid technical ASIC know-how, effective go-to-market, and geographical diversification strategies. Mining companies’ profitability is affected by many factors, including BTC price, electricity cost, hash rate, and investment in mining machines. Mining machine manufacturers, however, have a greater focus on R&D investment into mining chip capabilities. CAN is diversifying its revenue sources; I believe it is better positioned than its cryptocurrency mining peers based on profitability. As mentioned earlier, I see market conditions and an end to US rate hikes as key to driving a recovery in BTC and, thus CAN’s valuation. The company is trading at a significant discount to the sector median, so I remain bullish on the stock despite the macro and industry-related risks. My end-of-year price target of $15.2 on the stock is based on a forward PE assumption of 8x applied to the CY2024 earning estimate of $1.90. Seeking Alpha Risks CAN's blockchain business is heavily dependent on the trends in the Bitcoin market, and a significant decline in the price of Bitcoin could result in a significant loss of revenue. In addition, as the regulatory environment around cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving, CAN must closely monitor and adapt to changes in the markets and countries where it operates to ensure that its products and services comply with local rules. The ASIC-based mining machine manufacturing market has attracted many new entrants in recent years, which could pose a challenge to established players such as CAN, potentially leading to a loss of market share and financial forecast misses. Final Thoughts Canaan is well positioned for a cyclical rebound in Bitcoin prices in 2023 and aims to achieve a more balanced revenue mix. The company is set to benefit from the growth of the global Bitcoin mining machine market, and the company has diversified geographically, de-risking its China exposure. Although there are some risks associated with the company, including regulatory risks and the uncertainty in bitcoin prices, I believe they are reflected in the stock’s valuation, and a rebound in bitcoin prices would certainly create more upside. Moreover, as cryptocurrency regulation increases worldwide, Canaan's management retains a flexible approach to adjust its operating policies in response to market developments. I remain bullish on the stock with an end-of-year price target of $15.20 based on a forward PE assumption of 8x applied to the CY2024 earning estimate of $1.90.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4596127-canaan-well-positioned-for-long-term-growth?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12075031.jpeg

42393726,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj2l2F,1682375379,Twitter Ends Legacy Blue Checks and Bluesky Emerges as a Decentralized Alternative,"The changing significance of Twitter's blue verification checkmark since Elon Musk bought the social media company has created a debate among Twitter users.  Journalists, celebrities, government figures and others were able to apply for this mark of verification without charge, so long as they met certain criteria. Blue checkmarks used to be considered a sign of notability and authenticity.  In recent months, however, the rules changed. Now Twitter will allow anyone to use a blue check mark on their account for an $8 monthly fee. Last week, the site officially removed the blue check marks, leaving notable figures and journalists vulnerable to impersonation. Those without blue checkmarks will also receive lower visibility across Twitter feeds.  In an age where anyone can pay for verification, blue checkmarks have become less meaningful.  Anita Ramaswamy, a technology and finance opinion columnist at Reuters, told CoinDesk that legacy verification was a helpful tool for her as a journalist – for herself and also for finding creditable sources.  “I’m going to continue to browse Twitter to the extent I can as long as other people in the tech community are still using it, but will have to take everything I read there with an even bigger grain of salt than I did previously because I can’t easily verify that an account representing a public figure or media outlet is actually from that person or institution,” said Ramaswamy.  “Unfortunately, I haven’t heard yet of an alternative that has anywhere near the traction of Twitter, so I’m currently in ‘wait and see’ mode before I invest significant energy and time into another social platform.”  Some have already moved to Bluesky, a platform backed by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey that is often touted as a decentralized Twitter alternative, opening up the potential for Web3 ideas to reach mainstream users.  Bluesky sees its opening  Dorsey began teasing his plans to build a decentralized social protocol in 2019. In an effort to make the user experience similar, he laid plans to build fundamentals of blockchain technology into the application including open-source hosting, governance structures and monetization opportunities.  In August 2021, Dorsey hired Jay Graber, blockchain developer and contributor to privacy coin ZCash, to lead Bluesky as CEO. Over the past two years, Graber and the Bluesky team have been building out the Authenticated Transport Protocol, or “AT Protocol,” in order to make social media interoperable and decentralized across different applications united under one ecosystem.  In October, when Bluesky opened the waitlist for its beta, it received 30,000 signups in 48 hours.  “Our goal is to assemble a social media architecture that composes third-party services into a seamless user experience because an open ecosystem is likely to evolve more quickly than a single approach to curation or moderation developed within one company,” said Graber in a March blog post. “By creating the interfaces for innovation in these areas, we hope to provide a dynamic and user-driven social experience.”  In early March, Bluesky hit mobile application stores and opened its beta to select names on the waitlist, ushering in a flood of users eager to test out a decentralized social media model. The platform has also granted early users “invite codes” in order to encourage adoption.  CoinDesk obtained one of these invitations in order to test out Bluesky. At present, the experience is similar to Twitter, although features are more streamlined. There is no verification strategy, uncensored content, no direct messages or supplemental features like “lists” or Spaces. Users can simply post, like and repost content on the application.  Despite its bare-bones features, Bluesky is growing in popularity among those who are seeking to move away from Twitter.  Andrew Rossow, an attorney and founder of AR Media, told CoinDesk that after years of using Twitter he’s ready to take a step back due to the recent policies that have made the application no longer productive to use.  “I cannot stand by and support a platform that treats user identity and content preferences as a marketing ploy and chance to profit, without any regard for the injuries and harm that will inevitably come from it – this is a feeling many users share who have felt the repercussions of being ‘vulnerable’ to targeted attacks,"" he said.  Rossow predicted that Twitter’s days are “numbered,” and that many of these pain points brought on by the application can be solved by decentralized media. He sees decentralized social media platforms like Bluesky and others rising in popularity, including Zion, Nostr and Mastodon, as a way for users to communicate without barriers established by one leader in charge.  Nostr’s Damus was listed on the Apple app store in February 2022 and has also received support from Dorsey, who gave 14 BTC in funding in December 2022 to help development efforts.  “For users that are prioritizing identity, content moderation and account portability, I strongly believe there will be a large migration of users from Twitter towards decentralized social media platforms,” said Rossow.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | AR,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/04/24/as-twitter-ends-legacy-blue-checks-bluesky-emerges-as-decentralized-alternative,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/976724847bc34e362aed6686f5de24f8504ba5a5-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393733,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj2lhH,1682371899,"Ethereum Layer 2 Networks’ Total Value Locked Hovers at Near-Record High, Data Shows","As ether’s price rose in April, so did the total value locked (TVL) of Ethereum layer 2, or companion, networks, reaching $10 billion on April 14, its highest level yet. TVL has subsequently declined amid a swoon in crypto prices but remains at around $9.29 billion, more than double where it stood at the start of the year, data from layer 2 analytics site L2Beat shows.  ​TVL represents the overall value of crypto assets deposited in a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol or in DeFi protocols generally. The rising TVL reflects a growing interest in scaling systems.  L2Beat data shows that some five million ether (ETH) worth over $10 billion were locked on the Ethereum blockchain in mid-April as ETH rose above $2,100. TVL has dropped 10% over the past five days to its current level as ETH sank below $1,900. On Jan. 1, with ETH below $1,200, TVL was just $4.1 billion.  Messari Research Analyst Stephanie Dunbar told CoinDesk in an email that layer 2 networks’ recent TVL spike has come as users grow weary of Ethereum’s hefty fees during peak network demand periods and opt for less-expensive platforms, many of which have sprouted in recent months.  Arbitrum domination  Arbitrum One dominates the layer 2 scaling landscape, accounting for more than 66% of the market share, according to L2Beat. Optimism follows with over 20% of the market share. Both Arbitrum and Optimism are Optimistic rollups designed to reduce transaction costs.  This year, Arbitrium, the fourth-largest blockchain in TVL, has surpassed Ethereum for daily transactions, averaging about 1.2 million in March compared to the latter platform’s 1.1 million transactions, according to block explorer Arbiscan and Etherscan.  Riyad Carey, research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko, also sees potential airdrops and enthusiasm for new chains driving layer 2 initiatives, including Arbitrum’s own airdrop of its ARB token last month. He told CoinDesk that he was “curious to see how sticky Arbitrum's users and transactions will be now that its airdrop has happened.”  Carey added that he considers TVL to be a flawed metric because it depends on the token’s price shifts. Historically, TVL and token prices rise in tandem.  Despite the price fluctuation issue, Messari’s Dunbar sees TVL as a ""legitimate mechanism"" for gauging ""network usage, interest, as well as value considering it is representative of the market's valuation of the network.”  Pedro Lapenta, head of research at crypto asset manager Hashdex, suggested that, besides TVL, investors should analyze a network along with other metrics such as transaction volumes because “in any analysis, one isolated (metric) can not tell you the whole picture.”  “While TVL can be an easy-to-understand metric (especially for DeFi), it can also be misleading,” Lapenta told CoinDesk, pointing to a Sybil attack on Solana last year that created $7.5 billion of fake TVL.  Rising interest in ZK-rollups  Newly unveiled zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups zkSync Era and Polygon zkEVM have registered the fastest-growing TVL over the past month, with TVL rising on the latter to $5.18 million, a 14% increase over the past seven days. ZkSync Era accounted for $240 million in TVL, up 0.2% during the same period, according to L2Beat data.  ZK rollups generate cryptographic proofs to validate the authenticity of transactions. They differ from Optimistic rollups that can be challenged and assess fraudulent transactions through fraud proofs.  According to Dunbar, ZK rollups are generally considered “top-notch for scaling” because of their “high-security guarantees and fast finality times,” but the challenge remains to achieve EVM-equivalence, which is more complex for ZK rollups as compared to Optimistic rollups given technical complexities. “EVM-equivalence is desired as both the user and developer experience is tightly coupled with Ethereum, enabling the use of the same infrastructure and tooling,"" she said.  “Imagine being able to deploy an app on a ZK rollup using the same tooling, infrastructure and smart contract code, or as a user being able to use the same wallets you already use,"" she said, adding: ""This is what the race for zkEVMs is all about: scaling Ethereum with the benefits of zk tech, but sticking as closely as possible to the Ethereum experience.""",POSITIVE,ETH | ARB,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | ARB,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/24/ethereum-layer-2-networks-total-value-locked-hovers-at-near-record-high-data-shows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4a6c6bf301fb44e7fd361a0c8704cc6ef0402f6b-5472x3648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On the one-day chart, Filecoin is showing consolidation with a loss of 1.1%. Over the last week, the coin has depreciated by nearly 17%. The technical outlook for Filecoin indicates bearish pressure, with a drop in demand and accumulation. If sellers push further, it will add to the bearish pressure. Related Reading: Losses Dominate Crypto Over The Weekend, Has The Bear Market Returned? Bitcoin’s struggle to stay above $30,000 has affected other altcoins, keeping them below their immediate resistance levels. The demand must recover in the next trading sessions for FIL to jump above the $5.50 price. The decline in the market capitalization of Filecoin over the past day also indicates growing selling pressure. Broader market strength remains crucial for the altcoin’s price movement over the subsequent trading sessions. Filecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, the trading price for FIL was $5.26. Following its drop below the $6 mark, Filecoin has experienced a continuous free fall. The coin faces overhead resistance at $5.60; surpassing this level will push the coin towards $6, with a potential attempt to trade at $6.30. Conversely, failing to trade at the current level will establish local support for the coin at $4.90. If the price falls below this level, it will reach $3.80, strengthening the bears. In the last session, the amount of Filecoin traded was in the red, indicating a drop in demand. Technical Analysis Over the past few trading sessions, the buying strength for FIL has decreased considerably due to a fall in demand. The Relative Strength Index showed that the buying strength had depreciated, and selling strength had taken over, as the index was below the 40 mark. Additionally, the FIL price dropped below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, indicating that sellers had taken control and were driving the price momentum in the market. However, if Filecoin surpasses the $5.60 mark, the coin may rise above the 20-SMA line, bringing back the bulls. At the time of writing, Filecoin gave sell signals in line with other technical indicators. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence showed red histograms, indicating sell signals for price momentum and trend reversals. Related Reading: ADA Price (Cardano) Close Below $0.38 Could Spark Larger Degree Correction These signals suggested that FIL may experience further decline over the next trading sessions.

In March 2022, after the European Union placed sanctions on Russia in response to its attack on Ukraine, Binance announced it would not support deposits from Visa and Mastercard cards issued in Russia, as well as any Visa and Mastercard deposits made from the Russia.  Now, the restriction seems to be gone: Users can deposit Russian rubles, euros, British pounds and other currencies from bank cards issued in Russia, crypto news website Forklog reported on Saturday.  Earlier in April, Russian users also reported that Binance lifted limits for accounts with balances larger than 10,000 euros for users in Russia. The exchange has not officially released a statement on either of these changes.  When contacted today by CoinDesk, a Binance spokesperson did not explicitly confirm or deny the lifting of restrictions, but stated in an email: “All current restrictions related to sanctions against Russian nationals are applied by the platform and its legal entities in the European Union in full.”  Read also: Russian Journalists, Activists Kicked Off Crypto Exchanges Due to EU Sanctions  Last year’s ban on Russian bank cards came after the EU and the U.S. imposed sanctions on Russia invading Ukraine. Most Russian banks were cut off from the international interbank settlement network SWIFT. Both Visa and Mastercard suspended their operations in Russia in March 2022, however cards issued before that month that haven't expired yet still work domestically, but are now processed by the local payment network National Payment Cards System.  Last spring, the EU broadened its sanctions and prohibited crypto services from serving Russian users with account balances over 10,000 euros. In the fall, that threshold was eliminated, making it impossible for Russian citizens and residents to use any crypto service registered in the EU. Immediately, LocalBitcoins, Crypto.com and Blockchain.com notified Russian users that their accounts would soon be discontinued.  When Binance announced the 10,000-euro limit for users inside Russia, it stated “the EU’s fifth package of restrictive measures against Russia” required the limitations. While the sanctions are still in place, this restriction no longer exists on Binance, according to media reports, and neither does the Russian bank cards ban. Last month, however, Binance prohibited peer-to-peer (p2p) trades in dollars and euros for Russian citizens and residents, leaving only the Russian ruble option. The Binance spokesperson confirmed this restriction remains.  Speaking at the Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal, in October, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said Binance abides by the sanctions but some of its legal entities outside of the EU might still be able to serve Russians. “We are against dictatorships of war. We’re not against the population,"" Zhao said.

12071981,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=528381,1682368217,"Bitcoin’s Upcycle Shows Small Drawdowns, Report","The Bitcoin (BTC) market has faced some resistance this week, according to a report by cryptocurrency analytics firm Glassnode. The market reverted from a weekly high of over $31,000 to a low of $27,000, signaling a potential correction in the market. Despite this recent dip, Glassnode’s analysis shows that the opening to 2023 has been historically strong for Bitcoin, with remarkably few significant corrections. The largest correction seen so far has been -18.6%, a relatively small drawdown compared to past cycles. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Rebounding After A Major Drop, Will It Recover Previous Losses? Bitcoin Market Sees Transition From Loss To Profit According to the report by Glassnode, the aggregate market for Bitcoin has confidently transitioned out of a period of unrealized loss and into one of unrealized profit. This is evidenced by the sharp divergence between supply held in profit versus supply held at a loss. As this shift occurs, the incentive to take profits grows, also reflected in the ratio between supply in profit and supply at a loss. Glassnode’s analysis shows that this oscillator has achieved escape velocity in 2023, confirming the transition out of a regime of loss dominance near cycle lows. This phenomenon has only been observed on 415 out of 4,638 trading days, or just 9% of the time. This shift in the market is significant because it suggests that investors are becoming more confident in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. As more investors move into a position of unrealized profit, they may be more likely to hold onto their investments rather than take profits and risk missing out on potential gains. Will BTC Retest The $25,000 Support? Altcoin Sherpa, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, recently shared his thoughts on the current state of Bitcoin. He believes that if the current market area fails, the next area up is around $25k. He also noted that the .382 fib level, a technical indicator, usually gets tapped as a retest eventually. Despite this potential dip, Altcoin Sherpa maintains a bullish outlook on Bitcoin’s market structure. On the same note, Michael Van de Pope, a crypto analyst and trader, suggests that the market is seeking a higher low (HL) in the weekly timeframe, potentially around the $26,500-27,000 range or even as low as $25,000. This suggests that there may be some downside risk in the short term. However, Van de Pope notes that breaking back above $27,800 could lead to a strong upwards reaction for Bitcoin, potentially continuing the uptrend toward $29,000. Related Reading: Cardano At Risk Of Falling 8% If It Doesn’t Hold Above Key Support Line At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $27,300, representing a 0.8% decrease over the past 24 hours. Despite this drop, Bitcoin is holding above its last major resistance level of $27,100. However, some analysts are predicting a potential retest of the $25,000 support floor, which could lead to further downside potential for the largest cryptocurrency in the market.

Crypto prices extend retreat,"Coinbase Global ( NASDAQ: COIN ) stock sank 7.2% on Monday as the broader cryptocurrency market came under further pressure following a notable rally earlier this month. The global crypto market cap egged down 0.3% to $1.16T, according to CoinMarketCap data , mostly driven by bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) 0.5% slump to $27.41K and ethereum's ( ETH-USD ) 0.8% descent to $1.83K, at the time of writing. Nonetheless, both tokens are up significantly year-to-date as crypto-market investors price in expectations that the end of the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle could be on the horizon. That's one of the main reasons why Standard Chartered predicted that bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) could reach $100K by the end of 2024. From the start of 2023, COIN also soared 63%, though it's trading near all-time lows as the crypto industry continues to grapple with a barrage of headwinds, including macroeconomic and regulatory issues.

42393722,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj2khj,1682366400,House Republicans Make Case on Stablecoin Bill After Democrats Called for Do-Over,"Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee are taking another swing at stablecoin legislation with a discussion draft revealed Monday afternoon, which may mark a new starting point for negotiations with Democrats.  The bill – the second legislative concept published in as many weeks – would create a definition of “payment stablecoins,” specifying what types of entities could issue them and define how these companies should handle reserves.  Unlike a previous version of the bill, which was published on the committee’s website ahead of a hearing on stablecoins last week, the new version leaves out algorithmic stablecoins, although it does repeat clauses stating that an issuer can either be a subsidiary of a federally insured depository institution or a state or federally regulated nonbank company.  The draft bill also makes clear that stablecoins must be fully backed by safe reserves that are subject to monthly reviews by registered accountants, which would eliminate the possibility of math-backed stablecoins being able to comply.  It also declares that stablecoins are not securities, settling a controversial point in the ongoing debate over whether tokens are securities or commodities, which decides which agency will oversee their trading – the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The SEC had recently warned stablecoin issuer Paxos that it may face an enforcement action, asserting Binance USD is an unregistered security.  It’s unlikely this bill will have the immediate bipartisan support it needs to become a law. During last week’s hearing, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the senior-most Democrat on the committee, said the legislative body should be “starting from scratch.” She expressed frustration the Republicans had gone ahead and worked on this draft without Democratic input.  A senior Republican staff member said a copy of this draft was provided to Waters’ staff, and the Republicans hope it’ll start a new negotiation.  Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, has not committed to any action on stablecoin legislation, only saying through a spokesperson that he would “look at” the different efforts being put together. Any stablecoin bill will also have to pass through his committee.  One of the most hotly debated points of the legislation since last year has been how much authority is given to the federal and state regulators. This version would make a lane for state-based licensing for issuers and maintain the state’s enforcement powers, but it also provides that an enforcement disagreement could be overruled by the Federal Reserve.  In addition, the proposed legislation would put issuers’ chief executives on the hook for putting out faulty information on a stablecoin’s reserves, calling for them to sign off on the monthly numbers and making them criminally liable if the reports are known to be false.  Rep. Patrick McHenry’s (R-N.C.) financial services committee is separately working on legislation to regulate market structure in the crypto sector, the staffer said, and that bill is expected to address key industry questions about which agencies will have what roles overseeing digital assets.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at around $27,350, down 0.4% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. BTC dropped below $28,000 on Friday afternoon, part of a two-day slide that followed a week above $30,000. At one point, bitcoin was changing hands near $27,100.  Sam Callahan, an analyst at bitcoin financial services firm Swan Bitcoin, told CoinDesk that BTC's recent price drop can be interpreted as “a period of consolidation and a healthy correction after an explosive move upwards past $30,000 over the last several months.”  “Market participants seem to be exercising some caution in light of the heightened probability of the Federal Reserve maintaining interest rates higher for longer, as well as several economic metrics signaling weakness in the economy,” Callahan said.  Investors are eyeing next week’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. The CME FedWatch Tool currently shows a 91% probability of the U.S. central bank raising interest rates 25 basis points (bps).  “Nevertheless, bitcoin's value proposition as an asset without counterparty risk has never been more compelling amid the turmoil recently experienced in the banking sector, and the price reflects that,” Callahan added.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, was changing hands around $1,833 on Monday, down 0.8% from Sunday, same time.  Over the past week, BTC and ETH have sunk 7% and 11%, respectively, as investors mulled over industry and macroeconomic uncertainties, including a drop in U.S. dollar liquidity. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which measures overall crypto market performance, was recently almost flat for the day and down 9.3% for the week.  Crypto data firm Kaiko noted in a Monday report that despite the recent price drop, the BTC-to-gold ratio continued to head north last week, with one BTC equalling 14.7 ounces of gold in early April, up from 9 ounces at the beginning of the year.  “A rising ratio means that BTC is outperforming safe-haven gold despite the ongoing macro uncertainty and is a bullish signal,” Kaiko said, adding the ratio, which had previously fallen to its lowest level when the FTX exchange collapsed in November, rebounded this year.  Equities were trading mixed Monday afternoon, with the S&P 500 almost flat and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sliding 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was up 0.1% for the day.

While several cryptocurrencies have shown price weakness, the Celer Network token has been the biggest loser over the past 24 hours. In recent times, the general market sentiment has drastically changed. Most traders who called for a bull market after BTC’s previous week’s rally are now bearish due to a price retracement on major cryptocurrencies. However, will bulls show strength and prevent the next outcome for Celer’s Network token? Related Reading: FTT Token On a 8% Rockslide Despite FTX Ray Of Hope. Here’s Why CELR Bears On A Mission, Further Losses Imminent? Bears are on a mission as they move on a trail to wipe out two-week gains of the Celer Network token. The current price action results from CELR investors taking profits on the recent Bitcoin price rally, which saw the cryptocurrency move past $30,000 for the first time since June 2022. The native token of the Celer Network was on the move and recorded a 7-day high of $0.031 after BTC bulls pushed the price upwards and lifted the entire market with the digital asset. At the time of writing, Coinmarketcap data reveals CELR to be trading at $0.023, a notable dump from where it was in price last week. Bulls may now need to act to defend what is left of the previous week’s gains of the Celer Network token. CELR price retraces back to key support after previous week gains | Source: CELRUSD on TradingView CELR is currently trading at a key support price zone of $0.023 and might be at just the right spot for bulls to pick up steam and reverse the bearish trend. However, the price of Bitcoin is a major price decider for the crypto market and could dictate CELR’s fate in the coming days. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $27,327 and is currently faced with resistance at $27,800, according to a recent tweet by crypto analyst Michael Van De Poppe. Rejecting that resistance level may see Bitcoin sweeping further lows until it can bounce up. Same old, same old for #Bitcoin. Isn't able to break through $27,800 as resistance point. Would be looking at a sweep of the lows until we can have a bounce. However, $27,800 is crucial for a trend reversal, not $28,800. pic.twitter.com/7U7MS1lcus — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) April 24, 2023 A further Bitcoin price depreciation could mean dire consequences for CELR, thereby inviting bears to sweep off the remaining gains of the previous two-week candles. Celer Network Token Price Unshaken By Recent Platform Development Despite Celer Network’s recent development to its platform, a corresponding bullish impact is yet to be seen in the price of its native token. One recent development expands Celer’s bridging support for Izumi Finance native token (IZI) and the IUSD stablecoin. Celer Network users can now seamlessly and securely bridge the tokens mentioned above between Arbitrum, Ethereum, Polygon, and ZKsync networks at low transaction costs.

42393725,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj2kx7,1682361538,What to Expect at Consensus 2023,"Crypto is down but not out. The industry that took a beating last year is set to make its first major public showing of 2023 at Consensus, CoinDesk’s annual conference. Many of the biggest names in crypto, government, Web3 and more will be in Austin, Texas, this week to discuss the current state of the industry, the devastating year it just had and what the future may hold.  On that score, things are looking up. If the first four months of the year are any indication of where the industry is heading, the rebuilding has begun.  Get your tickets for Consensus 2023 in Austin, Texas here.  In the U.S., regulatory uncertainty has given way to the certainty that crypto will be regulated. The European Union has provided the model, with the landmark omnibus MiCA regulations being voted into law last week. Even China, which banned crypto officially in 2019, seems to be warming to Web3.  Still, there’s much more building, policymaking, educating and, yes, investing to be done. While recent markets have given some reason for optimism, fraud and contagion have absolutely smashed consumer confidence in the industry. Regaining that trust will be difficult, but that is the opportunity at the feet of today’s builders, regulators and decision makers – many of whom will share their views at Consensus.  Here’s what to expect this week in Austin.  Consensus 2023 Basics  If you’re unfamiliar, Consensus is a three-day conference in Austin. It’s run by CoinDesk, and it brings together major figures in crypto, finance, Web3, regulation, entertainment and more for three days. This year, it will take place April 26-28. Short of going to Austin or attending with a virtual ticket, the best way to keep up with what’s happening at the conference is to follow CoinDesk. For regular daily updates on the show, you can subscribe to the official newsletter, The Node.  See also: Dragonfly's Haseeb Qureshi Is Still Optimistic in the Crypto Winter  The TradFi perspective  One of the biggest topics at Consensus will be how the traditional-finance world should now regard its relationship with crypto.  This past year kicked off with a series of bank runs, failures and buyouts that seem to echo the economic conditions that birthed Bitcoin. The London Times didn’t exactly rerun the same infamous headline Satoshi inserted in to Bitcoin genesis block, “Chancellor on brink of second bailout…,” but the finance world was more than made aware of the concept of “moral hazard” when U.S. regulators stepped in to rescue three banks (and letting one fail).  The failures, coupled with stubborn inflation, didn’t hurt the price of bitcoin, which soared in the wake of those events. That helped reignite the narrative that bitcoin could one day become a legitimate hedge asset. While few corporations are buying bitcoin like they did in 2021 as a way to diversify balance sheets, institutions are still building and adopting blockchain, or distributed ledger technology. Societe General, the august French institution, recently issued a euro-denominated stablecoin, while asset manager BlackRock is backing a major bitcoin mining concern.  With Ethereum’s recent Shanghai upgrade, which finally enables anyone to stake and unstake ether (ETH) at a whim, there’s a growing acknowledgement that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization could become crypto’s analog to the finance world’s “risk-free” rate of return. That reality is likely a ways off, but it is notable that ETH prices started to climb after the Shanghai hard fork, bucking analysts’ predictions of a mass sell-off.  [This is] perhaps the greatest opportunity for clear direction for an industry that is crying out for it.  Clearly, the opportunities exist for TradFi institutions to enter and make money in crypto – in the short and long term. Dawn Harflinger, president and CEO of the Liliʻuokalani Trust, will speak about the $1.2 billion fund’s long-term position on crypto at the Consensus conference. Meanwhile, CoinDesk senior reporter Ian Allison is scheduled to speak with Jose Fernandez da Ponte, who runs the crypto and digital currencies business unit at PayPal (PYPL), arguably the fintech company that has taken the largest position on crypto developing as a tool for everyday financial use.  What the BUIDLers are building  In the first three months of 2023, venture-capital investments in crypto slowed to a trickle – just $900 million compared with the many billions that flowed into crypto last year. Many crypto-native funds, however, are restocked with capital, either raised or earned from the last bull market, and are waiting for the right projects to invest in.  After the collapse of FTX, a centralized exchange, VCs have recommitted themselves to the tenets of decentralization. In particular, a number of funds are allocating dollars into “crypto infrastructure” – the distributed (and tamperproof) base upon which the wider crypto economy sits. This is by definition a broad category, including everything from layer 1 blockchains to scalable systems like crypto exchange Coinbase’s (COIN) recently launched Base network.  Likewise, projects with their own token treasuries are beginning to deploy millions of dollars in funding to pay for open-source development of their ecosystems. For example, Solana, which was hit especially hard by the downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX empire, is showing the “stickiness” of crypto projects with committed developer communities and the funding necessary to pay them.  See also: What Are VCs Funding After FTX? More Decentralized Infrastructure  There is plenty to build. Udi Wertheimer, a prominent bitcoiner, and Muneeb Ali, the creator of the Stacks blockchain, will both speak about the wildfire of development activity spreading across Bitcoin, sparked by the quiet launch of Bitcoin Ordinals (aka Bitcoin NFTs). Separately Sunny Aggarwal, the founder of Cosmos’ largest decentralized exchange, will discuss the inter-chain plumbing that needs to be built for all blockchains to be able to interact seamlessly, and competing visions for the most active multi-chain network yet, Cosmos.  Spinning Web3  “NFT” is a clunky initialization of an even clunkier phrase, non-fungible token. That’s probably a big reason why over the past year major brands such as Reddit and Starbucks (SBUX) that are looking to experiment with “digital collectibles” did so without calling them NFTs. Those who saw this as an indictment of crypto missed the counterpoint: Crypto prices were in the doldrums, and so simply slapping “Web3” or “NFT” on a project wasn’t going to help, but those brands still had enough confidence in the concept to launch them in the first place.  Crypto is likely to continue growing this way – in the background. Case in point: Solana is gearing up to launch the Solana Phone, targeting not the mass market but committed crypto users who want to keep their funds safe but still accessible. Futurist Cathy Hackl is giving a presentation at Consensus about our “post-smartphone” future, when augmented reality and artificial intelligence are ubiquitous.  The market for crypto phones and wearables might still be small, but it's all a part of the wider “ownership economy” that is rocketing to life. There are competing visions for what exactly this will look like, and how far crypto or the metaverse will penetrate everyday life, but one thing is for sure, e-sports as one of the fastest growing entertainment segments will increasingly adopt new ownership models, GameSquare’s (GAME) Jason Lake will argue at Consensus.  Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov, likewise, will discuss the role blockchain oracles and data providers will play in an increasingly digitized world.  Rules, regulations and crackdowns  The whole industry is feeling the pressure from regulators, and those regulators aren’t sitting idly by. Last week, the European Union took a leap forward by becoming the first major economic region to vote in a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto. In the U.S., it’s clear the government wants to rein in the industry, though the exact form that takes is still to be determined.  Policy issues will take center stage at Consensus 2023. Jeremy Allaire, chief executive and co-founder of stablecoin issuer Circle, is due to speak on-stage with CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael Casey about the future of the stablecoin industry, which bridges the traditional and emerging financial sectors.  See also: The Big Issues of Stablecoin Issuance | Opinion  On Friday, Consensus hosts the Policy Summit, a track of sessions that includes a chance to hear from Dr. Marwan Al Zarouni, a strategic adviser to Digital Dubai and the United Arab Emirates government, about the emergence of multipolar crypto hubs as well as a policy discussion featuring Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, who is perhaps the most active crypto lobbyist in Washington.  Coming to consensus  The name Consensus is perhaps more apt this year than any other. While universal agreement is an unattainable, if not antithetical idea in crypto, you can’t move without direction. And by bringing together many of the biggest names and most influential people in crypto and finance, Consensus 2023 represents perhaps the greatest opportunity for clear direction for an industry that is crying out for it.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,"Daniel Kuhn, Pete Pachal",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/04/24/what-to-expect-at-consensus-2023,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1437b5b19146f6d6fea52af6ec7b608a80b68cfb-1955x1100.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
12069398,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=528347,1682361048,"Standard Chartered Predicts Bitcoin Could Reach $100,000 By End of 2024","Bitcoin, the world’s most well-known cryptocurrency, has been on a wild ride over the past few years, with its price surging to new highs before crashing back down. Despite this, some experts still believe the asset could record new significant highs in a few years to come. At current market prices, Bitcoin has currently decreased by 60% from its all-time high of $69,000 seen in November 2021. BTC Could Reach $100,000 According to a note from Standard Chartered’s head of digital assets research, Geoff Kendrick, the “crypto winter” may finally be over, and Bitcoin could reach $100,000 by the end of 2024. Kendrick attributes this potential surge in Bitcoin’s price to a number of factors. These include recent turmoil in the banking sector, a stabilization of risk assets as the US Federal Reserve ends its rate-hiking cycle, and the improved profitability of crypto mining. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) To Tap Into $30,000 Region Before A Slow Down, Here’s Why Kendrick said these factors are making the pathway to the $100,000 level “becoming clearer.” But while Kendrick acknowledges that there are still sources of uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin, he believes that the potential for Bitcoin to reach $100,000 is very real. This prediction is particularly noteworthy given that Bitcoin’s price has already surged so far this year. It rose above $30,000 in April for the first time in 10 months. Bitcoin Price Action In The Past 7 Days Bitcoin has experienced a tumultuous journey in the last week, with its price surging to as high as $30,000 on April 18 to crashing back down below $28,000 over the weekend. Over the past 7 days, Bitcoin has been in a downtrend down by nearly 10% in just a week. Related Reading: Bitcoin Traders Count Losses As Total Liquidations Approach $300 Million The asset’s market cap has also lost some value, as it lost over $20 billion from its market capitalization in the last week. Bitcoin currently trades at $27,479 at the time of writing down by 0.6% in the last 24 hours. Several factors contributed to the initial surge in Bitcoin’s price. This includes the fall of United States dollar dominance and the rising US banking crisis, which prompted several traditional bankers to seek another store of value. However, the surge was short-lived, and Bitcoin’s price crashed back down in the past seven days. This sudden drop in Bitcoin’s price was likely caused by a combination of profit-taking from investors who had bought in at lower prices last year, and concerns over increased regulatory scrutiny. Despite this recent volatility, many experts remain bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. As more and more institutions adopt cryptocurrency and retail investors get involved, it seems that Bitcoin will continue to play a significant role in the financial markets for years to come. Standard Chartered’s prediction of a $100,000 Bitcoin price by the end of 2024 may seem ambitious. But it is not an isolated forecast. According to a survey conducted by London-based crypto hedge fund Nickel Digital Asset Management, the majority of professional investors believe that Bitcoin is becoming more mainstream and that this trend is likely to continue in the coming years. Several other experts including former Coinbase Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Balaji Srinivasan have made similar predictions, suggesting that Bitcoin could go as high as $1 million in the long run. The Coinbase executive went as far as making a bold bet on the future of Bitcoin, claiming that the cryptocurrency will surge to $1 million by June 17th. This optimistic forecast is attributed to the rapid devaluation of the US dollar. However, it’s important to remember that cryptocurrency prices are notoriously volatile and difficult to predict. Though Bitcoin’s price has been on an upward trajectory in recent months, it’s entirely possible that it could experience significant pullbacks or corrections in the future.

42393735,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj2lX1,1682360278,"Polygon, Cardano and Solana NFT Sales Rise as Ethereum NFT Sales Slump","While the Ethereum blockchain remains by far the most popular choice for minting non-fungible tokens (NFT), other layer 1 blockchains and layer 2 networks have recently had small bumps in NFT sales.  According to data from CryptoSlam, layer 1 blockchain Cardano, whose token is ADA, briefly overtook Ethereum scaling platform Polygon early on Monday as the fourth-most popular blockchain by NFT sales volume.  As of Monday afternoon, Cardano had slid back into the sixth spot behind BNB and Polygon, according to Crypto Slam, although its sales were up 86% over the past 24 hours. The bump seems to have been led by interest in two projects, Goofy Gophers and Spacebudz, that have had over 185,000 ADA (about $70,000) in trading volume in the last 24 hours, according to CNFT.io.  Other blockchains, including Solana (SOL), have had growing sales volume over the past seven days. Solana experienced a jump in sales, unique buyers and unique sellers on April 22, largely due to the release of Mad Lads, which had such high demand it had to delay its mint. The mad dash for the Mad Lads contributed over $8 million of the $9.9 million in sales on April 22 – a high not seen since January, according to Crypto Slam. Overall, Solana's sales volume has grown by 129% over the past seven days.  Meanwhile, Polygon has experienced a rise in sales volume over the past few days, according to a Dune dashboard compiled by NFT researcher Sealaunch. It appears that NFT collection Y00ts, which recently migrated from Solana to Polygon, has been driving much of the movement on OpenSea and Magic Eden.  The growth of NFT sales across alternative blockchains comes as sales of Ethereum NFTs have shrunk in recent days. The sales volume on Ethereum is down 12% over the past seven days, according to Crypto Slam, while the number of unique buyers and sellers on Ethereum has also dipped.  It appears the overall NFT market has cooled amid an extended crypto winter, with a handful of collections eliciting brief spikes in trading over the past few months. According to a Dune dashboard by SeaLaunch, the number of unique users across top NFT marketplaces including Blur, OpenSea and LooksRare fell to 7,805 on April 19, a low not seen since July 2021. The number of sales across NFT marketplaces also fell sharply, with 16,149 sales recorded on April 19, according to the same data from Dune. The last time the number of sales was that low was in November 2021. Numbers have recovered slightly over the past few days.",POSITIVE,ADA | SOL,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | SOL,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/04/24/polygon-cardano-and-solana-nft-sales-rise-as-ethereum-nft-sales-slump,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0a58c507ab229cbe7b665d5230865e403ea0d238-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
12068868,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=528396,1682359561,Why Bitcoin May Have Completed The “Perfect” Pullback,"Bitcoin price is trading at around $27,000 per coin after failing to hold above $30,000. Crypto market sentiment would suggest that BTC is already back at lows, ready for a fresh decline. However, if a perfected TD buy setup is an indication, then BTC might have just finished its pullback and is ready to continue upward with renewed momentum. A Perfect Pullback For Buying The Dip In Bitcoin? The cryptocurrency community has been on a rollercoaster ride of emotions the past several weeks. Bitcoin’s early 2023 rally caught bears by surprise. Rising beyond $30,000, however, was an opportunity to strike while bulls were blinded by euphoria from recent returns. Much more quickly than bulls became exuberant over the top crypto asset by market cap doubling in value since bear market lows, bears are celebrating a continuation of crypto winter without so much as a sign of a symbolic snowflake. Related Reading: Time To Pay Attention: Bitcoin Reaches “Logical” Level Another sign has triggered elsewhere. In this case, a perfected TD8 buy setup has appeared on daily BTCUSD spot exchange charts. A perfected signal arrives when a new low is made. The buy setup usually reaches a full TD9 count, but has perfected ahead of schedule. This could still mean another low to put in a perfected TD9, but the 8-count could also do the trick. Will Bitcoin bounce on the perfected TD8? | BTCUSD on TradingView.com BTCUSD Triggers TD8 Setup On Daily Price Charts The TD Sequential is a market timing tool created by Thomas Demark. It counts a sequence of up and down candles, until the sequence is satisfied, and the count reaches 9. If the TD9 setup fails to produce the expected reversal, a countdown to TD13 begins. Related Reading: Brace Yourself: The Most Explosive Move In Bitcoin In Years Has Begun A TD13 signals trend exhaustion. Both the TD9 and 13 don’t necessarily guarantee a reversal, but it does improve the probability if at a key level. The tool has worked well on the buy side of BTCUSD daily charts since the local bottom was put in. As you can see, past perfected TD setups led to an immediate upside reaction. However, it is important to note that each of the above signals are TD9s and not a TD8. As notable as the signal appearing today is, the reaction over the next 24-48 hours is what matters the most. If BTCUSD fends off more significant downside and buying kicks in here at this signal, it could tell the market the correction is over, and the bull run is going to continue.

Will the price also mimic this? Bitcoin ESR Has Continued To Sharply Ascend In Recent Weeks As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the ESR is currently acting as a leading indicator for BTC’s price. A relevant metric here is the “exchange reserve,” which measures the total amount of a cryptocurrency that’s currently sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges. The “ESR” is an indicator that tells us about the ratio between the exchange reserve for Bitcoin and that for the combined stablecoins market (both denominated in USD). Generally, investors shift assets like BTC into stables whenever they want to escape the volatility associated with the former. When holders like these eventually want to switch back into the volatile markets, they deposit their stablecoins into exchanges to do so. The coins they exchange their stables for naturally feel a buying pressure from the conversion. Because of this reason, the stablecoin exchange reserve may be looked at as the “available buying power” for other cryptocurrencies like BTC. Related Reading: What’s Behind The Recent Bitcoin Drop? Here’s What On-Chain Data Says The exchange reserve for Bitcoin itself, however, represents the selling supply in the market, as investors generally deposit their BTC into these platforms for selling purposes. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the BTC ESR over the last year: Looks like the value of the metric has rapidly risen in recent weeks | Source: CryptoQuant According to the quant, the Bitcoin price and ESR were showing convergence during the year 2021, meaning that the two curves were moving in close tandem. This convergence continued in early 2022, as the chart above displays. However, the convergence broke with the 3AC bankruptcy in June of that year, as the price of the asset plummeted, but the ESR didn’t register any significant fluctuations at all. In late 2022, a positive divergence started forming between the two lines, as the ESR began to climb while Bitcoin continued to move sideways around the post-FTX crash lows. In January of this year, the BTC price also finally started following in the direction of the indicator, as it began its rally. The ESR has continued to sharply climb since then, while BTC has also generally observed strong upwards momentum. An interesting trend was seen back at the beginning of March when the ESR had taken a plunge. Not too long after this drawdown in the indicator occurred, the BTC price also plummeted down. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Update: Is $27,000 The Local Bottom? But while this decline in the price was happening, the metric had already reversed back to an uptrend. As it turned out, the cryptocurrency also did the same after finishing its drop. “In the current market structure, ESR acts as a magnet to Bitcoin’s spot price,” explains the analyst. Earlier this month, the ESR again observed some decline, but it wasn’t long before the metric reversed its trend and resumed the upward trajectory. Recently, BTC has also been plunging, as its price has now gone below the $28,000 level. If the pattern that followed earlier is anything to go by, this divergence between the two lines should mean that BTC will also reverse its current decline, in order to mimic what the ESR has been doing.

It changed hands at $27.35K as of shortly before 1:00 p.m. ET. Nonetheless, the potential climb to $100K could be driven by the recent banking turmoil, which ""has helped to re-establish BTC’s core use case as a decentralised, trustless and scarce digital asset,"" analyst Geoff Kendrick explained. Another positive driver includes a ""gradually improving"" macroeconomic backdrop for risky/alternative assets as the end of the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle nears. ""While BTC can trade well when risky assets suffer, correlations to the Nasdaq suggest that it should trade better if risky assets improve broadly,"" he added. Looking to the long-term, bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) next halving -- the mechanism whereby the reward for mining a new block on the blockchain is cut in half after every 210,000 blocks produced -- could also be a boon for its price, the report said. The event, which is part of the process of capping BTC's supply at 21 million coins, is due around April 2024. “As we approach the next halving, we expect cyclical drivers to become more constructive, as they have in previous cycles.” “Given these advantages, we think BTC’s share of total digital assets market cap could move into the 50-60% range in the next few months (from around 45% currently),” Kendrick contended. Standard Chartered is not alone in predicting a robust upswing. Last week, Mercuryo Chief Product Officer called for a $35K price tag by the end of Q2 so long as its year-to-date trend of higher lows are sustained. On the other side of the fence, Seeking Alpha contributor David Huston sees more pain ahead, as the token last week dropped below its 23-day moving average. Should bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) see as much upside as Standard Chartered is calling for, keep an eye on these publicly-traded bitcoin miners, the profitability and stock price of which depend greatly on the token's price: Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), Marathon Digital ( MARA ), HIVE Blockchain ( HIVE ), Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ), Bitfarms ( BITF ), Bit Digital ( BTBT ), CleanSpark ( CLSK ), Greenidge Generation ( GREE ) and Core Scientific ( OTCPK:CORZQ ).

12066957,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=528309,1682353801,Cardano At Risk Of Falling 8% If It Doesn’t Hold Above Key Support Line,"The Cardano price surged as it broke through a critical resistance trendline on its chart, a few days ago. However, the bullish momentum was short-lived, and ADA has since lost 0.5% of its value on the daily chart. The past week saw a significant depreciation of 14% in ADA’s value, with demand and accumulation both falling. As Bitcoin retraces on its chart, most altcoins have followed the same price direction. The technical outlook of the altcoin has also sided with the bears. For Cardano to regain momentum, buying strength needs to pick up over the next trading sessions. However, another push from the sellers can potentially cause ADA to lose its local support level, leading to a considerable fall in prices. Related Reading: MATIC Below Key Support Levels: What’s Next? Cardano has also formed a v-shaped top reversal pattern, indicating a decline in demand over the last trading sessions. The market capitalization of Cardano has fallen, suggesting increased sell orders at the time of writing. Cardano Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, ADA was trading at $0.38, experiencing a significant drop since losing the $0.40 price mark. Overhead resistance for the altcoin is currently at $0.40 and then at $0.42. Breaching the $0.42 price level could trigger bullish momentum. However, if Cardano fails to maintain its price above the immediate support level of $0.37, the bears could push the price down to $0.35. In the last trading session, the amount of Cardano traded was red, indicating that selling pressure had increased at press time. Technical Analysis Demand for Cardano has seen a steep decline following its loss of the $0.40 support line. At the time of writing, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) was parked below the 50-mark, forming a downtick, indicating that sellers had outnumbered buyers. Similarly, Cardano has fallen below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, implying that sellers are driving the price momentum in the market. Reclaiming the $0.40 mark could help Cardano rise above the 20-SMA, potentially aiding the coin’s recovery. At the time of writing, Cardano’s technical indicators showed sell signals in accordance with other indicators. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicated the price momentum and trend reversals via red histograms. These histograms are associated with the coin’s sell signal, indicating that the price could drop further before a reversal occurs. Related Reading: What’s Next For Ethereum Price As It Drops Below $2,000? Additionally, the Bollinger Bands, which measure price volatility and asset fluctuations, had opened up, signaling that Cardano may experience fluctuations. The upper band of the indicator serves as a critical resistance level for the altcoin. Moreover, broader market sentiment remains a significant factor influencing the asset’s price direction.

Though the ECB has previously said it will decide whether to proceed with the digital euro later this year, its Executive Board member appeared to concede that political opposition could still prove a decisive obstacle, in remarks to the parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee.  “There should be a political decision to issue [a digital euro], and then the central bank should be ready to respond,” Panetta said.  “If that call [not to go ahead] is done at the political level” – via the European Parliament, and the European Union’s Council, which represents its member states – “I cannot see any chance of the ECB deciding autonomously or independently to progress,” he added.  Panetta urged lawmakers to pass new laws making the digital euro legal tender – implying that merchants who accept digital payments would also have to take the CBDC, an issue the ECB has already broached with finance ministers.  “We want to be sure that in any situation, in any circumstance, we will have a framework that would allow all European citizens to pay everywhere in a safe and efficient manner at cheap costs,” Panetta told the committee. He cited ECB research that suggests citizens see the ability to pay anywhere as the “most important feature” of a CBDC.  The ECB is also considering how to grant access to around 5% of the population who don’t have or want a bank account, including conducting identity checks via Post Offices, online or through other intermediaries, Panetta said.  During the debate, Jonás Fernández joined the chorus of lawmakers querying the point of the initiative.  “Some people are calling into question of whether it is necessary to have a digital euro when it's so difficult to distinguish it from any other payment method,” said Fernández, ranking member on the committee for his center-left Socialists and Democrats party. “What do you think are the advantages that would make us want to continue working on this project?”  But Panetta seems undeterred, telling a Brussels audience earlier Monday that he didn’t view remarks from lawmakers as skepticism, but as welcome scrutiny of his ideas.  “I think they are rightly interested in understanding the details … if we make mistakes there could be big damage,” he said. “We will not make mistakes, but I think it is good that others want to check this.”  Read more: EU Lawmakers Skeptical on Digital Euro Plans",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/24/lawmakers-could-still-nix-digital-euro-ecbs-panetta-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3730c4c2ef11fd476cead41b6c458ee3b52630ac-4032x3024.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Will SOL make a strong comeback? Solana has emerged as one of the most popular blockchains in the cryptocurrency industry due to its fast transactions and expanding ecosystem. However, it had a rough year in 2022, like others, and even worse due to the crash of FTX. Fast-forward to January 2023, SOL started the year at $9.9610 and steadily rose above $20. At one point, SOL traded at $26, but it declined to $21.65% today due to a market-wide bearish trend. As a result, both investors and retail traders wonder if there’ll be a potential rebound or more dips in the future. Reason Behind The SOL Pullback Solana (SOL), like many other cryptocurrencies, has been affected by the recent market collapse. SOL’s price may drop further due to a loss in demand, general negative sentiment, and selling pressure in the cryptocurrency market. Also, the sudden decline of other significant cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum has impacted SOL negatively, leading to a decrease in its price. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whales On Buying Spree, Add 311 Billion Tokens During Price Dip SOL had a busy few weeks, reaching a remarkable high of $24.7 on April 15. Besides, futures traders with long positions incurred losses of about $650 million due to the falling price of major crypto assets. The liquidations were worse in Binance and OKX and continued till Sunday, April 23. Solana Bearish Trend Continues, When Will It End? A negative trend remains as SOL dropped to $21.33 today after encountering a resistance level of $22.35 earlier. SOL has been trading in a downtrend pattern since today’s trading session. It appears that the bears are holding their ground as SOL is trading at $21.57, with a minor recovery. SOL must protect $21.11 as its first defense against further losses, and the next significant support level will be below the $20 level if the bears continue to be in charge. If the market’s structure changes, the resistance to any further gains may be located near $22.35 at this time. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Holds Above $0.00001 – Is It Time For A Rally? The price has fluctuated between $21.11 and $21.40 during the last few hours, making it difficult for the bulls to push it beyond $22.35. Technical indicators like the RSI and MACD exhibit a gloomy picture. The RSI is currently at 41.83, indicating that the market is close to the oversold region and that SOL may decline further if the buyers don’t take back control.

Two of the sanctioned individuals, Cheng Hung Man and Wu Huihui, were over-the-counter (OTC) traders who facilitated crypto transactions for Lazarus, the agency said, while a third person, Sim Hyon Sop, provided other financial support. The Treasury investigation identified several bitcoin addresses associated with Wu, while tying an ether, arbitrum and Binance chain address to Sim.  “The DPRK continues to exploit virtual currency and extensive illicit facilitation networks to access the international financial system and generate revenue for the regime,” said Brian Nelson, the department's undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, in a statement, referring to the official name of North Korea.  The Lazarus Group has been accused of mounting a multibillion-dollar campaign against the crypto world, the proceeds of which are said to fund North Korea's weapons program. The Treasury says the hacker group is controlled by North Korea's intelligence organization, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, and it was behind the largest-ever crypto heist when it stole $625 million in digital assets from the Ronin network tied to the Axie Infinity game.

42393720,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj2kcb,1682346778,"Bitcoin Price May Hit $100K by End-2024, Standard Chartered Bank Says","CORRECTION (July 10, 15:05 UTC): Corrects timeline for forecast in headline and throughout, an earlier version said the forecast was the end of 2023.  Crypto winter is finally over and bitcoin (BTC), the world's largest cryptocurrency, has the potential to reach $100,000 by the end of 2024, according to a research report by Standard Chartered Bank.  The climb to $100,000 could be driven by a number of factors, including the recent banking-sector crisis that helped to “re-establish bitcoin’s use as a decentralized scarce digital asset,” the bank said in the report on Monday.  “Against this backdrop, bitcoin has benefited from its status as a branded safe haven, a perceived relative store of value and a means of remittance,” analyst Geoff Kendrick wrote. Bitcoin has gained 65% since the start of the year. It rose above $30,000 last week for the first time in almost a year. It was recently trading at $27,328, down 1.2% in the past 24 hours.  Read more: Bitcoin Posts Biggest Weekly Loss in 5 Months as Dollar Liquidity Declines, Debt Ceiling Fears Return  The report also noted one of the drivers for the price to reach $100,00 is the broader macro backdrop for risky assets gradually improving as the Federal Reserve nears the end of its tightening cycle. “While BTC can trade well when risky assets suffer, correlations to the Nasdaq suggest that it should trade better if risky assets improve broadly,” Kendrick said.  Standard Chartered expects bitcoin’s share of the entire crypto market capitalization to rise back to the 50%-60% range. The bitcoin dominance rate is now around 47%, according to data from TradingView. It was around 40% during the fallout of Silicon Valley Bank in mid-March.  Bitcoin’s upcoming halving – the process whereby the rewards for mining a new block gets halved every four years – is also poised to be a positive driver for bitcoin, Kendrick wrote. “As we approach the next halving, we expect cyclical drivers to become more constructive, as they have in previous cycles,” he said.

The coin had been trading above $0.5 until April 21, when a bearish wave pushed it below $0.45 to $0.43. The token has witnessed a slight recovery above $0.46 today. As a result, crypto enthusiasts fear a further decline in XRP. Notably, a prominent crypto analyst shared a post responding to his friend’s forecast of XRP slumping to $0.10, but Egrag’s response was that technical indicators on XRP price don’t support such a price decline. No Technical Indicator Supports Dropping To $0.10, Says Egrag The ongoing market-wide downturn has caught up with XRP, its price has been gaining momentum over the past few weeks. The coin succumbed to the bearish trend, pushing it to lose its past week’s gain by 9.87%. This downturn has stirred reactions among the crypto community, with people, including Egrag’s friend speculating a drop back to $0.10.

The analyst shared some technical insights for XRP in response to the friend’s prediction. Egrag noted that XRP’s movements aligned with his predetermined technical indicators like the Fibonacci targets. And no technical indicator or Fibonacci targets support the idea of Ripple’s native coin price correction to $0.10. Egrag said his friend’s forecast seems more like a personal speculative opinion than an analytic insight. He further noted that while a price correction to $0.10 is possible, the probability is slim and not as low as his friend speculates. Nevertheless, sudden regulatory enforcement could stir up such a price drop for XRP. Egrag argued that while crypto assets have some immunity against bearish economic events, their prices are still susceptible to unforeseen occurrences. Therefore, any notable XRP price decline to $0.10 would rather be due to a regulatory action instead of mere market forces. So, Egrag concluded that a price fall to $0.10 for XRP is technically impossible without unfair regulations. He encouraged the XRP Army to remain steadfast in support of the token as a significant price correction presents a buying opportunity. XRP Price Outlook Meanwhile, the XRP community anticipates the summary judgment for the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit regarding the token’s status as a security.

Attorney John Deaton, Amicus Curiae in the XRP lawsuit, forecasted that a ruling might come before May 6. XRP price often surged when Ripple hit some breakthroughs in the lawsuit. However, at press time, XRP is trading at $0.465, indicating a minor price recovery. The token has surrendered its 14-week price gains by 8.6%, with a seven-day price decline of 11.3% due to the market-wide onslaught. XRP’s current price move aligns with Egrag’s previous prediction that the token could pull back between $0.43 and $0.48.

12063882,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=528295,1682344221,"Losses Dominate Crypto Over The Weekend, Has The Bear Market Returned?","The crypto market was hit hard during the weekend as prices from Bitcoin to altcoins fell rapidly. During this time, there was also a decline in the trading volume and momentum in the market, which was partly responsible for the losses recorded. Now, with the new week, there is still a lot of skepticism in the market as Bitcoin’s decline below $30,000 could mean that the bear market is back in full force. Crypto Fear & Greed Index Remains Neutral One thing that highlights how investors are feeling when it comes to the market is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. This index takes into account things such as social media sentiment, market momentum, volatility, etc, and with this, it provides a score based on a 1-100 scale. Related Reading: Arbitrum Defies Bears As ARB Price Breaks Above $1.7 Resistance, But Can It Keep Up? Now, on this index, 1-25 marks extreme fear, which is when investors are very wary of the market. 26-50 is the fear territory but with less wariness from investors. 51-75 is greed, a region that shows investors are more likely to invest in the market. And finally, 76-100 is extreme greed when the euphoria is the highest in the market, usually seen in bull markets. However, the 48-52 levels are usually reserved for the ‘neutral’ level which is where the index currently sits. At this level, investors are usually reeling from a price surge or crash, and it shows an unwillingness to make any further moves until there is a better-defined movement in the market. Fear & Greed Index returns to neutral | Source: alternative.me If the index continues to maintain its neutral territory, then the crypto market may see prices consolidate for a while until investors are confident enough again to start getting back into the market. Could The Bear Market Be In Full Bloom? Presently, the crypto market is still seeing sideways movement rather than a definite upward or downward movement. This only shows a lack of interest in the market right now and not a continuation of the bear trend of 2022. Total market cap takes a hit during the weekend | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on TradingView.com Moreover, the total crypto market cap is still holding above $1 trillion which is a good sign for the market. Usually, a return to the bear market would see the total market cap fall below $1 trillion, and this would only happen if BTC were to fall below $20,000 once more. Related Reading: Bitcoin At $25,000 Or $30,000? Crypto Analyst Weighs In Unless such a market cap is experienced, the current trend only signals a correction from the run-up to $30,000.

Thetanuts Finance offers crypto structured products that cater to option traders, decentralized autonomous organizations, market makers and other liquidity providers. Users can earn yield on major cryptocurrencies and popular altcoins, provide liquidity, and execute short and long options strategies.  Thetanuts Finance will soon launch a buy-side altciin options market powered by decentralized options vaults, which the firm says will make options strategies – particularly those involving altcoins – available to more investors.  “At Thetanuts Finance, we are dedicated to leading the way in building a thriving altcoin options market for both budding and established ecosystems across different chains, including non-EVMs. Our commitment to innovation and decentralization has never been stronger, and we look forward to driving the DOV model to new heights,” Thetanuts Finance adviser Sherwin Lee in a press release, referring to Ethereum Virtual Machines.  Thetanuts Finance raised $18 million in March 2022 in a round that was led by crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, crypto options exchange Deribit, QCP Capital and Jump Crypto. Three Arrows collapsed about three months, largely because of its exposure to Terra, a crypto network that fell apart in May 2022.

12062880,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=528289,1682340359,Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Faces Make-Or-Break Moment,"The deep correction in the crypto market, led by the collapse of the Bitcoin price, has pushed the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price back into bearish territory. From a technical point of view, new bull moves are far away at the moment; before that, an make-or-break price level has to be defended and a resistance level that has manifested itself since the beginning of March has to be broken. Shiba Inu Price At Pivotal Point But first things first. A look at the 1-day chart of Shiba Inu shows that the price has fallen to the edge of the key support level. At press time, SHIB was trading at $0.00001021, slightly above key support at $0.00001005. As recently as early last week, a bullish picture was evolving for Shiba Inu. The price formed an ascending triangle on the 1-day chart, which is one of the continuation patterns and thus opened the chance for a more than 50% rise within the next weeks. However, due to the market-wide downturn, SHIB broke the ascending triangle to the downside. The pattern was invalidated, so that the Shiba Inu price is now stuck again in the range between $0.00001005 and $0.00001151. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Holds Above $0.00001 – Is It Time For A Rally? If the bulls fail to defend the range, a fall to $0.00000965 would be the most likely scenario before SHIB could possibly drop to the price level at $0.00000855. A breakdown below the trading range would be a clear break with the trend. Holding the support is of utmost importance to start a new run towards the range high at $0.00001155. A look at the 1-hour chart reveals that SHIB is showing slight signs of recovery. The price has initially formed a falling trend line which was broken at press time. This was followed by a re-test that is currently underway. SHIB now needs to show a significant move to the upside; at best a bounce and break above the $0.00001080 price level. IntoTheBlock data shows that SHIB has formed major resistances both above and below. The main bid wall below Shiba Inu sits at $0.000009. Around this price level, 43,000 addresses bought around 10.24 trillion SHIB. A daily close below this resistance level could have massive bearish implications. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whales On Buying Spree, Add 311 Billion Tokens During Price Dip IntoTheBlock’s data also shows that 200 billion SHIB was bought by whales last week. As NewsBTC reported, SHIB has recently been experiencing increased interest from this cohort of investors. This can be a clear bullish indicator. However, at the time of writing, the increased interest in SHIB from ETH whales has not yet paid off.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin fell 0.5% to $27,416 in the past 24 hours after facing selling pressure last week as bond yields rose and the U.S. dollar liquidity declined. The cryptocurrency registered a 9% weekly loss, its largest seven-day decline since early November, according to data from TradingView and CoinDesk. Bitcoin had reached $30,000 last week for the first time in almost a year. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose by six basis points to 3.58%, its second straight weekly gain, denting the appeal of risky assets, including cryptocurrencies. Ether also erased most of its monthly gains, trading recently at $1,851, down 1% in the past 24 hours. Simon Peters, an analyst at investment firm eToro, wrote in a morning note Monday that the market is yet to see bitcoin retest more precipitous levels that would suggest the recent rally is finished.  Existing crypto companies could get a “fast-track regime” to new European crypto rules, France’s Financial Markets Authority said in a Friday statement. France recently toughened its crypto registration procedures in the wake of crypto exchange FTX's collapse and in preparation for the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets law. The European Parliament voted in favor of MiCA last week, and the rules are set to take effect starting around July 2023. There will now be “consideration of a possible fast-track modular licensing"" between France’s existing regime, known as PSAN, and MiCA, which includes much tougher governance, consumer-protection and financial-stability rules, the AMF said.  U.S.-based crypto exchange Gemini revealed Friday plans to open an offshore derivatives platform – a decision announced as the regulatory environment gets tougher in its home country. The first product at Gemini Foundation, as the new division is called, will be a perpetual bitcoin contract denominated in Gemini dollars (GUSD), the company said, followed by a perpetual ether contract also linked to GUSD. Unlike conventional derivatives, perpetuals don't have an expiration date. The decision coincides with U.S. regulators getting stricter about cryptocurrencies. In January, the company and Genesis (which, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group) were accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission of selling unregistered securities.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows a 1% bid depth for Coinbase's (COIN) wrapped Ethereum staking token, cbETH, from March 26. The 1% bid depth refers to the number of outstanding purchase orders within 1% of the mid-price.  The bid depth rose after Ethereum implemented its highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade on March 12, allowing users to withdraw the ether staked in the network at will.  According to Kaiko, the uptick in the bid depth suggests traders are more willing ""to pick up the token should it dip relative to ETH.""

12062001,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=528281,1682336426,What’s Behind The Recent Bitcoin Drop? Here’s What On-Chain Data Says,"Bitcoin on-chain data hints that selling from the miners may have been behind the latest plunge in the asset’s price below the $28,000 mark. Bitcoin Miners Have Shown Signs Of Selling Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, miners had been putting on some selling pressure on Bitcoin while the decline had happened. A relevant indicator here is the “miner netflow,” which measures the net amount of Bitcoin entering into or exiting the wallets of all miners. When this metric has a positive value, it means a net number of coins is being transferred into the wallets of miners right now. Such a trend implies that these chain validators are accumulating currently, which is naturally something that could be bullish for the price. On the other hand, negative values suggest miners are transferring some BTC out of their holdings at the moment. Usually, miners transfer out their coins whenever they want to sell them. Hence, negative netflow values can have bearish consequences for the asset. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day simple moving average (SMA) Bitcoin miner netflow over the past week or so: The 30-day SMA value of the metric seems to have been quite negative in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the 30-day SMA Bitcoin miner netflow registered a very sharp red spike when the cryptocurrency’s price was in the middle of its decline a few days ago. BTC was just above $28,000 when this spike came, but the asset rapidly plummeted to the low $27,000 level following it. The timing of these large net outflows taking place from the miners may be a sign that it was this cohort’s selling that at least partially contributed to the coin’s drawdown. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Update: Is $27,000 The Local Bottom? The chart for the 30-day exponential moving average (EMA) Bitcoin miner reserve, a metric that measures the total amount of BTC all miners are holding right now, also shows this spike: Looks like the value of the indicator has plunged recently | Source: CryptoQuant This plummet in the Bitcoin miner reserve from a few days ago naturally makes sense, as the netflow is nothing but a measure of the changes taking place in this metric. From the chart, it’s visible that while the outflows may have been sizeable, they still haven’t significantly affected this cohort’s total holdings, meaning that many miners are still sitting still on their wallets. Related Reading: China Is Fast Losing Money: Their Bitcoin Stash Just Fell By $388 Million Nonetheless, compared to the average during the last 365 days, the current outflows are very large, as the data for the 14-day EMA Miners’ Position Index (MPI) below displays. The metric has shot up | Source: CryptoQuant It looks like the rate at which Bitcoin miners are selling right now (proportional to the past year) is greater than what even the FTX crash back in November 2022 saw. All these indicators suggest that this extraordinary selling pressure from these holders could be why BTC plunged to low $27,000 levels a couple of days ago, something that the coin is yet to recover. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $27,300, down 8% in the last week.

Kwon, who has been on the run from regulators since the collapse of his multibillion-dollar crypto enterprise in May 2022, was arrested in Montenegro last month for attempting to travel with falsified documents. Following his arrest, the SEC charged the South Korean national with securities fraud.  In its civil lawsuit against Kwon, the SEC failed to prove ""personal jurisdiction"" as products referenced by the regulator were ""available to the world and not directed at U.S. persons,"" a 47-page supporting document for a motion to dismiss the charges said. It also says that a digital asset involved in the case, the stablecoin UST, doesn't fall under the purview of the SEC because it is a currency and not a security.  ""Congress has not granted the SEC the power to regulate the digital assets at issue here,"" the document filed with a U.S. district court in New York said.  The company also didn't conduct any public offerings of securities that warranted an SEC registration, according to Kwon's representatives. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has been facing mounting criticism for regulating crypto through enforcement actions.  Kwon still faces criminal fraud charges from U.S. prosecutors as well as charges of capital-markets law violations in South Korea. Both countries have requested the extradition of the former executive who must first face trial in Montenegro.  The SEC can oppose the motion to dismiss by May 12.

As NewsBTC reported, the price is in a critical zone in the 1-day chart to maintain the long-term uptrend. Therefore, the next few days could be of great importance to determine the trend. Was $27,000 Already The Local Bottom For Bitcoin? Co-founders of on-chain analytics solution Glassnode, Jan Happel and Yann Allemann, agree that the bulls remain in control, but need to slowly turn the tide. “Bitcoin’s long-term uptrend is intact,” they write, but point to weakened momentum due to low trading volume. As Bitcoin currently hovers near support levels, smaller fluctuations of +/- $1k are anticipated, while moves between $27.5k and $32k would still be within the normal range as shown by the weekly volatility bands. However, the analysts expect some wicks to the downside. In case of a sustained downside break, the next support area would be at $25,500 to $26,000 . But according to the analysts, the risk is rather low. The Bitcoin risk signal is at 0 and looks a bit shaky in the short term despite the recent volatility, but is not indicating any panic selling. The Fear and Greed Index has pulled back from the greed zone to a neutral position at 52 points. Moreover, the analysts argue for a healthy correction in the market: The current market environment, characterized by unrealized profits outpacing unrealized losses (see NUPL on glassnode), implies optimism in the medium and long term. Related Reading: Time To Pay Attention: Bitcoin Reaches “Logical” Level Technical analyst Michaël van de Poppe expects that there will be a “classic Monday drop” before there is a reversal. Bullish events this week could be the release of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product for the first quarter (Thursday) and the release of the Core PCE (Friday). Crucial for a reversal, according to the analyst, is the price level at $27,800. “Divs in $26,800 area for longs on Bitcoin,” notes the analyst, who also explained: Correction as CME gap came in for Bitcoin. Back towards the resistance, for the second time. If Bitcoin breaks $27,800-28,000 entirely in the coming few days, acceleration towards $29,200 seems next. Funding negative on ETH, so a bounce is getting close.

42420741,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqizd,1682324792,"Bitcoin Posts Biggest Weekly Loss in 5 Months as Dollar Liquidity Declines, Debt Ceiling Fears Return","Bitcoin (BTC) faced selling pressure in the week ended Sunday as bond yields rose and the U.S. dollar liquidity declined.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell by 9% to $27,600, registering its largest single-week percentage loss since early November, according to data from TradingView and CoinDesk. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose by six basis points to 3.58%, its second-straight weekly gain, denting the appeal of risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.  The USD Liquidity Conditions Index, an indicator tracking the greenback's supply in the monetary system, slipped to $6.13 trillion, reaching its lowest point in over a month, according to data source TradingView. Besides, traders priced in a higher probability of the Federal Reserve continuing its tightening cycle with a 25 basis point rate hike in May.  Since 2021, bitcoin and the wider crypto market have closely tracked local peaks and troughs in the dollar liquidity index. Bitcoin rose to $28,000 in the first half of March as the Fed opened liquidity taps to contain the banking crisis, pushing the dollar liquidity index higher to $6.35 trillion from $5.82 trillion.  But the situation has changed.  ""In the absence of encouraging signs on the monetary liquidity front, BTC continued to drift down over the week after its sharp drop on Monday, dragging other large-cap crypto assets with it,"" Noelle Acheson, the author of Crypto Is Macro Now wrote in the weekend edition of the newsletter.  ""BTC – while being an 'insurance' asset that should outperform when other asset groups are suffering – is still heavily impacted by the overall macro mood, which will largely be driven by monetary liquidity expectations,"" Acheson added.  According to Dessislava Laneva, a macro analyst at Paris-based crypto data provider Kaiko, bitcoin and the financial markets in general,may see increased price turbulence in the near term, thanks to the U.S. debt ceiling issue.  The U.S. government reached its statutory debt limit – the self-imposed cap on borrowing – of $31.4 trillion in January, forcing the Treasury to implement extraordinary measures to help the government meet its obligations for at least five months. These measures also boosted the dollar liquidity and kept risky assets bid.  Since then, the debt-ceiling negotiations have been in a deadlock. Last week, one-year credit default swaps, which measure the cost of insuring against government default in the next 12 months, rose to a record high, according to the Wall Street Journal.  The current pricing in the CDS market shows a 2% probability of a default. That's uncomfortably high for something that could be a financial calamity, Andy Sparks, head of portfolio-management research at New York-based MSCI, told the Journal.  Observers are worried the Treasury may run out of money in June.  ""The debt ceiling drama is a source of short-term volatility and adds uncertainty to the market,"" Laneva told CoinDesk.  Bitcoin is still seen as a risky asset and may face selling pressure if equities throw a fit at some point. Risky assets took a beating during the 2011 debt-ceiling drama when a deadlock in Washington led to the country losing its top-notch triple-A sovereign credit rating.  ""Once a deal is reached, expected in the second half of the year, the Treasury will need to refill its reserves, thereby reducing liquidity and exacerbating the impact of quantitative tightening [sister of rate hikes] .... this situation may prompt the Fed to cut rates, which would ultimately benefit risk assets,"" Laneva said.  According to macro analyst Tom Dunleavy, a potential default might see bitcoin pick up a haven bid like it did during the recent banking crisis in March.  ""I find it unlikely that the U.S. goes into default. I think the debt-ceiling issue will be resolved before it comes to that,"" Dunleavy said. ""If the U.S. does default or we get close to the deadline without a deal, it should be immensely positive for BTC. We've seen the store-of-value story for BTC become more solidified with the recent bank failures. BTC's correlation to gold is also near all-time highs.""

42420744,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqj0f,1682321902,Declining Bitcoin-Ether Correlation Could Affect Crypto Investors’ Hedging Strategies: Coinbase,"The correlation between bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) returns has been declining since mid-March, when bitcoin started outperforming against the backdrop of the U.S. banking turmoil and increased regulatory scrutiny of non-bitcoin digital assets, crypto exchange Coinbase said in a research report Friday.  The decline in the correlation has become more pronounced following the Ethereum blockchain’s Shanghai upgrade – aka Shapella, the report said, noting that a similar trend was seen in September 2022 following the network’s previous update, the Merge.  The Shanghai upgrade, which was successfully completed on April 12, enables validators to withdraw staked ether.  “The relevance of this falling correlation for institutional investors is that it can affect quantitative strategies that rely on cross hedging one asset for the other (or using ETH as a hedge for less liquid altcoins),” analysts David Duong and Brian Cubellis wrote.  From a fundamental perspective “it supports diversification arguments in favor of holding both BTC and ETH,” they wrote.  The weakening in the 40-day correlation of daily returns may continue for another two weeks because the initial phase of ether withdrawals following the upgrade is still in effect, the note said.  Coinbase estimates that as of April 20 an additional 73,000 ether could be unlocked in partial withdrawals and 822,000 unlocked in full withdrawals and that could take about 15 days to process.

The Financial Information eXchange Protocol (FIX) – a common language that modern trading systems (investors’ machines, exchange computers and the like) use to speak with each other – has added greater support for cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. It’s done so by adopting the Digital Token Identifier (DTI) ISO standard, according to a Monday press release.  Stocks, bonds and other older financial instruments around the globe already use various standardized ID codes – a way to make it simpler to find and trade them and one of the trappings Wall Street types expect when navigating markets. So the emergence of DTI is a way to make crypto more palatable for TradFi. Meanwhile, FIX is what conveys trades throughout TradFi.  “Adding the DTI standard to the FIX Protocol was an easy decision as the DTI extends the existing functionality to the world of digital assets, which helps the market evolve to work with this asset class,” Jim Kaye, executive director at FIX, said in the press release. “We can see many benefits of adding the DTI, including making it easier for the industry to audit their transactions and increase transparency, thereby bringing more efficiencies to the market.”  The press release noted that DTI can be used by regulators to monitor digital trades for anti-money laundering and monitoring risk in trading, too.

Loopring Announces Red Packet 2.0 Loopring, a layer-2 decentralized exchange using zkRollups on Ethereum allowing traders to exchange assets, said NFT Red Packet 2.0, currently available on their Loopring Smart Wallet and the web app, let users transfer ERC-20 tokens and NFTs adapted to the ERC-1155 standard. Unlike the popular ERC-721 standard for building NFTs, the ERC-1155 version is more flexible, empowering users to create semi-fungible tokens and ordinary NFTs. Loopring developers started building Red Packets in 2021. However, developers expanded on traditional Red Packets creation when they also announced Blind Red Packets on April 20. Using this solution, users can only unveil the content of the “packet” after a given period. Supporters claim Red Packets will change the economics of NFTs and drive mainstream adoption while opening up more possibilities, especially in gaming, ticketing, and more, primarily because of the cost involved. Unlike transacting on the Ethereum mainnet, using layer-2 platforms for trading or asset transfer is relatively cheap. Related Reading: LoopRing Price Lags Despite Relief, Is LRC Double-Digit Gain Feasible? Users can securely send assets, including tokens and NFTs, off-chain while avoiding the high fees. However, they still are secured by the Ethereum mainnet. As an illustration, users on the mainnet have to pay $43.83 when writing on April 23. Meanwhile, based on L2Fees data, sending ETH on Loopring costs $0.06. Because of this allowance, users can pack thousands of NFTs on Loopring’s Blind Red Packets and gift them to users without having to pay high fees. It is an addition that the Loopring community has positively received, but that has not prevented prices from edging lower, as visible in the daily chart. LRC Drops 20% In 5 Days LRC is trading at $0.338, down 20% from April highs, and is underperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past 24 hours. Notably, prices broke lower on April 19 before they were confirmed on April 20 and in the second half of last week. When writing, prices are stable but remain within a bearish formation, having reversed all losses posted on April 14.

Despite the contraction of LRC prices, the token has more than doubled from December 2022, when prices fell to as low as $0.188.

12056115,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=528226,1682313361,MATIC Below Key Support Levels: What’s Next?,"MATIC had been consolidating between $1.4 and $1.8 until it faced bearish pressure and declined. Over the last week, it depreciated nearly 16%, with a 6% dip on the daily chart. The technical outlook indicated bearish price action, with a drop in demand and accumulation. Major altcoins also struggled to surpass their resistance levels as Bitcoin corrected itself. MATIC is currently stable on its local support line, but it broke two crucial price floors, suggesting that bears could dominate upcoming trading sessions. Related Reading: Avalanche Struggles Under $18 – More Losses Seem Likely A further round of bearish pressure could cause bears to take over entirely, causing MATIC to fall through its local support line. On the daily chart, the altcoin’s market capitalization indicated a negative change, implying that sellers were taking control. MATIC Price Analysis: One-Day Chart The altcoin had struggled to maintain its value above $1 and dropped to $0.98. The overhead resistance of MATIC was $1.02, but due to a consistent decrease in demand, buyers lost confidence in the asset. If the price can break above the $1.02 resistance level, it may reach $1.06 and recover the bullish momentum. However, if the price falls below $0.98, the local support line is at $0.96, and if the altcoin’s value drops further, it may break through the support line and trade around $0.90 before seeing any recovery. The last session showed a red volume bar, suggesting a decline in buying pressure on the daily chart. Technical Analysis The recent rejection at the $1.14 level resulted in a swift exit of buyers from the market. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) dropped below the halfway mark, suggesting that sellers were dominating over buyers at the moment. The same reading also indicated that MATIC went below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating an increase in selling pressure and that sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. Breaking above the resistance could enable MATIC to surge past the 20-SMA line, thereby strengthening the bulls’ position. MATIC has started to form sell signals on the one-day chart in alignment with other technical indicators, indicating a potential dip in price. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence, which indicates price momentum and trend changes, formed red histograms connected to sell signals for the altcoin. Related Reading: What’s Next For Ethereum Price As It Drops Below $2,000? Additionally, Bollinger Bands, which suggest price volatility and fluctuation, have opened up, suggesting that MATIC may experience more price volatility in the near future. The broader market strength is also important for MATIC, as it can influence the altcoin’s price movement. Overall, the current technical outlook of MATIC appears bearish.

42420749,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUqj4n,1682302923,First Mover Asia: What's Next After Bitcoin's Retreat,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Analysts take a look at what comes next after last week's downturn in bitcoin and ether prices.  Insights: Taylor Swift showed common sense in asking the sort of critical questions of FTX that any business negotiation should include, CoinDesk columnist David Morris suggests.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,208 +9.6 ▲ 0.8% Bitcoin (BTC) $27,779 +230.4 ▲ 0.8% Ethereum (ETH) $1,875 +18.9 ▲ 1.0% S&P 500  4,133.52 +3.7 ▲ 0.1% Gold  $1,994 +14.4 ▲ 0.7% Nikkei 225  28,564.37 −93.2 ▼ 0.3% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Crypto markets complete round-trip after big rally. What comes next?  The big story in crypto markets last week was that ether turned lower, erasing all price gains notched during the weeks-long mini-rally that followed the seamless implementation on April 12 of the Ethereum blockchain's highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade. Bitcoin reversed course as well, losing its foothold above $30,000 and changing hands at about $27,800 around press time.  According to Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital, technical signals found in bitcoin's price chart still look encouraging.  ""A healthy retest of the support zone between $25K to $27K is a positive sign for a continued move up,"" DiPasquale told CoinDesk in an email. ""As long as bitcoin manages to stay above $22K, in the worst case, we can expect more upward action.""  Insights  What Taylor Swift Can Teach You About Investing  Angry victims of the FTX swindle are looking for restitution from the celebrity spokespeople who pitched the failed exchange, in a lawsuit that names Larry David, Tom Brady and Shaquille O’Neill, among others. One name not on that list is Taylor Swift, who was offered a reported $100 million sponsorship deal with the offshore crypto exchange – but dodged embarrassment and potential legal fallout by exercising some basic skepticism.  Swift reportedly asked FTX representatives, “Can you tell me that these [listed assets] are not unregistered securities?” in the course of negotiations, which ultimately failed. That’s according to Adam Moskowitz, the plaintiffs' lawyer in the FTX endorsements suit, speaking to The Block’s Frank Chaparro. Moskowitz describes learning about the incident in the discovery phase of the suit, and I haven’t seen confirmation from Taylor Swift’s camp.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But even if it’s a bit of a just-so story, there’s a wealth of wisdom in this little parable. It wouldn’t be the first time Swift showed herself to be a brilliant and sharp-elbowed businesswoman on top of her musical talent – for instance, having muscled her way free of an onerous publishing deal.  The lesson of her FTX adventure, though, is a bit more abstract than it seems. Swift’s question about unregistered securities was remarkably prescient, given that we’re now seeing aggressive regulatory crackdowns on crypto exchanges. She has, it seems, been paying attention. But selling unregistered securities wasn't what brought FTX down – old-fashioned fraud was the culprit. Swift did not, it seems, ask FTX representatives, “Is your management team secretly sending user assets to an affiliated hedge fund?”  How, then, might her securities law question, largely unrelated to the risk that ultimately manifested, have led Swift to shy away from going into business with FTX? I’m speculating here, but one likely scenario is that she or her people weren’t satisfied with the way FTX handled this and other questions. For instance, maybe FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried or his representatives were confused or uncoordinated or defensive – all useful signs of an organization that may have deeper problems. (Or maybe the Swift camp didn’t appreciate FTX’s boy wonder playing “League of Legends” during their meeting.)
