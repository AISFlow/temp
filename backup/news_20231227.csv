21824669,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=567114,1703716218,When Will Bitcoin Bull Run Begin? This Could Be The Metric To Watch,"A pattern in the supply of the Bitcoin long-term holders could provide some hints about when the next bull run might begin in earnest. Bitcoin HODLer Balance Has Followed A Specific Pattern In Previous Cycles According to the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the supply of the BTC HODLers is “an excellent indicator for measuring market cycles.” The “HODLers” or long-term holders (LTHs) refer to the Bitcoin investors who have held onto their coins since at least a year ago without having sold or transferred them on the blockchain. Related Reading: Polygon Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle, Analyst Puts This Target The LTHs are the resolute hands in the market, which rarely sell their coins even when a profitable opportunity has presented itself or a deep price crash has occurred. One way to track the behavior of these diamond hands is through the combined amount of balance they carry in their wallets. The chart below shows this Bitcoin metric trend over the past few years. The value of the metric seems to have been steadily going up in recent months | Source: IntoTheBlock on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin supply held by the HODLers has been showing some growth over the past couple of years, suggesting that the LTHs have been accumulating. This rise in the indicator has also continued through the latest rally, implying that the LTHs aren’t yet ready to start taking their profits. Something to note is that when the metric goes up, it doesn’t mean buying is happening in the present. The indicator naturally has a 1-year lag associated with it, as coins must mature for that long before they can be included in the cohort. However, this only applies to buying as the holders moving their coins to sell instantly reset the age back to zero and, hence, remove them from the group. In the chart, the analytics firm has highlighted a pattern that the Bitcoin LTH supply has observed during the leadup to past bull runs. It would appear that the HODLers have shown accumulation in such periods. On the other hand, the start of selling from this cohort coincided with the beginning of the bull rally in proper. So far, the HODLers have only been accumulating recently, implying that the market may be in the pre-bull run phase. Related Reading: Fantom (FTM) To Rocket Up To $1.60 If This Happens: Analyst If the historical pattern indeed holds for the current cycle as well, then the HODLer supply could be one to watch, as a significant downtrend in it could turn out to be a signal that the bull run has begun once more.

21820005,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=567129,1703703642,Major Acquisition: MicroStrategy Grows Bitcoin Reserves By 14K BTC Ahead Of ETF Approval,"MicroStrategy (MSTR), a prominent Bitcoin holding company, has once again expanded its BTC holdings with a substantial purchase of 14,620 Bitcoin, amounting to a staggering $615.7 million. The former CEO of the American business intelligence (BI) firm announced the acquisition, highlighting the company’s continued confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. With the potential approval of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the horizon, MicroStrategy aims to capitalize on the positive impact on BTC’s price and the company’s profitability in the leading cryptocurrency market. MicroStrategy Stock Skyrockets 337% According to a CNBC report, MicroStrategy’s stock has experienced a remarkable 337% surge in 2023, making it one of the top gainers among US companies valued at $5 billion or more. This success surpasses the rallies of industry giants like Nvidia and Meta. Unlike its tech peers, MicroStrategy’s appeal to investors stems primarily from its Bitcoin holdings. Related Reading: Bitcoin Grabs 14th Spot As World’s Most Valued Currency, Latest Data Show MicroStrategy’s market capitalization currently stands at $8.5 billion, with a staggering 90% directly tied to its Bitcoin holdings. The company’s stock price closely mirrors the performance of Bitcoin, with significant fluctuations in response to the cryptocurrency’s price movements. Per the report, in 2022, when Bitcoin experienced a 64% decline, MicroStrategy’s stock plummeted by 74%. Despite the substantial gains achieved this year, MicroStrategy shares are still below their peak levels in 2021, during the cryptocurrency’s peak. Michael Saylor’s Vision MicroStrategy’s decision to invest in Bitcoin dates back to July 2020, when the company recognized the potential of alternative assets, including digital currencies. At that time, MicroStrategy had a market capitalization of around $1.1 billion, primarily driven by its software business, which has been shrinking since 2015. Co-founder Michael Saylor, who was CEO then, saw an opportunity to put the company’s idle cash reserves to work, considering low interest rates and the need for diversification. Saylor’s conviction in Bitcoin as a digital form of gold led MicroStrategy to prioritize Bitcoin purchases over equities and precious metals. This strategic move exposed investors to Bitcoin indirectly through MicroStrategy’s stock. Saylor, who transitioned to executive chairman, remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s future, expecting the bull market to continue into the next year. Despite its growing popularity, Saylor emphasized that Bitcoin still represents only a fraction of global capital allocation, with ample room for further growth. Related Reading: Crypto Trading Firm Expects Bitcoin To Crash To $36,000, Here’s Why As of December 27, 2023, MicroStrategy’s latest purchase adds to its already impressive Bitcoin portfolio, bringing the total holdings to 189,150 BTC. The company has invested approximately $5.9 billion, with an average purchase price of $31,168 per Bitcoin. These strategic acquisitions position MicroStrategy as a major player in the crypto space, aligning its interests with the anticipated growth and adoption of Bitcoin. The current market data shows that Bitcoin is trading at $42,900, reflecting a marginal 0.5% increase over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency briefly dipped below its critical support level of $42,000 but has since regained its position. The market is anticipating the potential approval of the Bitcoin Spot ETF applications between January 5 and 10, 2024. This development holds significant promise for Bitcoin, as it could drive the cryptocurrency’s price well beyond $50,000, establishing a new yearly high and edging closer to its historical peak.

21818025,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=567089,1703698230,"Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Explode 58,000% To $352","A crypto analyst has put together a bold prediction as to the future trajectory of the XRP price. Based on his prediction, the XRP community could see the crypto token’s price enter three digits soon enough. XRP Price To Rise To $352 In a video posted on YouTube, the crypto analyst behind the JWK Show channel concluded that XRP’s price could potentially rise to as high as $352. He made this conclusion after using an XRP calculator. This calculator was invented based on a valuation model developed by Susan Athey, who happens to be on Ripple’s board, and Robert Mitchnick, a former employee at the crypto firm. Related Reading: The Crypto Bulls Are Back: Digital Asset Inflows Cross $103 Million In One Week The crypto analyst had input metrics like transaction volume, circulating supply, store of value, and how long it would take to process transactions into the XRP calculator before getting the price of $352. Although there was no timeframe for when this price could be actualized, it is worth mentioning that the calculator was working with figures achieved based on a five-year outlook. The crypto analyst also alluded to an X (formerly Twitter) post before stating that the XRP community could see the crypto token “finally mooning” in 2024. The price prediction of $352 seems like a far reach, considering that XRP still sits at around $0.6. That price level, however, seems more attainable when compared with more daring price predictions like the one of XRP hitting $10,000 in the future. Analysts like Davinci Jeremie may, however, argue that anything is possible with XRP, considering that he recently suggested that the XRP price movement defies technical analysis. XRP trending at $0.63 | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com XRP And Other Altcoins Entering Into Bull Phase The analyst behind the JWKShow channel also shared his analysis of the altcoin market. He noted that there has been a breakout as altcoins have left the accumulation phase and are headed for the bull phase. He drew similarities between the current chart pattern and one in 2019, just before altcoins entered into the bull phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Millionaires Rise By 246% In 2023, Here’s How Many There Are He specifically touched on the XRP price as he stated that it is a good time to invest in the crypto token. One of his reasons for saying this is because XRP is projected to break out of a two-year trendline soon enough, which could see its price rise significantly. He also alluded to the spike in XRP’s transaction volume, which is also bullish for the crypto token. Interestingly, the crypto analyst also happens to be among those who believe that the XRP price is suppressed. He said that the price of XRP will go parabolic “when the 1% are ready, which should be in 2024.” It is, however, unclear who is the “1%” he is referring to. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.62, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42418954,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUD7cL,1703695500,What to Expect From Bitcoin in 2024,"Optimism regarding a spot bitcoin ETF application approval ignited an almost 49% gain in BTC's price since October. It is likely that the Securities and Exchange Commission approves or denies multiple applications simultaneously for logistical and consistency reasons. (Figures cited are as of Dec. 18 unless noted otherwise.)  Spot BTC trading is concentrated on several exchanges: Coinbase, Binance, Bybit and OKX. They account for about 65% of spot BTC trading. Binance accounts for 35.5%, while Bybit, OKX and Coinbase account for 11.3%, 9.2%, and 8.9%, respectively.  The average BTC order size has been decreasing since early 2021 and is about $1,652. While smaller order sizes are associated with retail customers, many, if not most, institutions divide trade orders into smaller orders to minimize slippage. It would be imprudent to suggest retail customers were primarily responsible for recent trading patterns in BTC based on order size analysis alone.

Coinbase's third-quarter 2023 trading summary suggests declining volume in three of the past four quarter-over-quarter measures. Volume among retail and institutional traders has fallen at a similar pace over the course of the past year, with retail and institutional customers trading about $4.2 billion and $24.7 billion in the third quarter, respectively.  Figure 1. Source: CoinBase, Path Digital Advisors  Bitcoin futures markets  CME Group's BTC futures open interest reached $4.55 billion, accounting for about 25% of total BTC open interest. Current open interest reached a level last seen in the second quarter of 2022.  Figure 2. Source: CME Group, Path Digital Advisors  The majority of CME BTC futures positions are held by asset managers and leveraged funds, with the former exhibiting a long bias and the latter showing a short bias. This appears intuitive as asset managers tend to approach investing with a longer time horizon relative to other buy-side customers. Conversely, hedge funds and commodity trading advisers, or CTAs, tend to trade with a shorter time horizon and engage in basis trading and hedging.  Institutional investors are becoming more active in the crypto space. CME Group notes that ""average large Bitcoin open-interest holders, with at least 25 contracts, hit an all-time high the week of November 7, 2023.""  The funding rate aligns the perpetual futures price to the spot price. When the funding rate is positive, long contract holders pay the funding fee to the short contract holders, and vice versa. The funding rate has trended higher with the spot price of BTC, suggesting bullish sentiment and bias.  Bitcoin outlook  The historical relationship between BTC prices and consumer interest has decoupled recently. If the antecedent that consumer interest is solely driven by retail customers is true, then it appears that either:  Retail customers are trading without conducting research, or  Institutional investors are having an outsized influence on prices.  The sentiment among institutional investors appears to be constructive. The parallel upward shifts of the futures curve in each month of the fourth quarter of 2023 suggest bullish activity and a long bias among institutional investors.  The ETF approval is sufficiently baked into bitcoin prices such that positive momentum from the announcement may be offset by traders taking profits off the table. This suggests a possible reversion to the mean in the days after the announcement. Thereafter, the market will likely recalibrate its focus to the halving in April.  Figure 3.

42397001,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAZMof3,1703695500,Crypto Had Reputational Issues This Year. 2024 Will Change That,"This time of year brims with intergenerational dialogue and forward-looking optimism. As a mother-son duo immersed in cryptocurrency, we recently explored the opportunities and challenges that crypto will encounter in 2024.  While our opinions diverged on topics like decentralized finance, or DeFi, and the U.S. impact on global crypto adoption, we concurred that the coming year, though challenging, could be transformative for the trust and growth of digital assets.  A primary hurdle for crypto in the past year has been its tarnished reputation, which we attribute to three main factors: institutional mistrust in digital assets, an unclear valuation process fueling skepticism and an overemphasis on speculative investment. This skepticism was mirrored by influential leaders like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who continue to raise concerns about crypto's association with illegal activities and regulatory noncompliance.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Strong institutional support has been hampered by these credibility and utility issues. For example, Berkshire Hathaway's negative stance on crypto contrasts with Warren Buffett's early career, where he invested in speculative pink sheet ventures for value. This hesitation has allowed a narrative of fraud to dominate discussions about crypto's legitimacy as a valuable innovation. We believe that addressing these concerns through effective due diligence, risk management and a zero-tolerance approach to fraud will significantly enhance trust and support.  The recent enforcement actions against fraudulent activities in the crypto sector, including the Binance and FTX cases, can be seen as crucial for rebuilding trust. Regulators' firm stance against fraud is a net positive as it makes way for a more trustworthy environment. This is a sentiment echoed by Congress with the unanimous passage of the Deploying American Blockchains Act of 2023, signaling growing support for digital assets.  Looking to 2024, two possible developments stand out.  First, SEC approval of spot bitcoin ETFs could stimulate more excitement and support for digital assets, clarifying regulatory uncertainties and valuation concerns. The recent excitement about advancements in payment processing, particularly with the introduction of PayPal's U.S. dollar stablecoin, PYUSD, highlights the need for clarity. This excitement, however, was muddled due to the competition with other stablecoins that have varying commitments to reserve, anti-fraud or custody obligations. A new ETF approval could facilitate the growth of other blockchain projects including trustworthy stablecoins.  Second, the push for modernizing U.S. capital markets' infrastructure aligns with the demands of digital-native generations for efficiency and transparency. Initiatives like the upcoming T+1 trade settlement deadline and Blackrock CEO Larry Fink's prediction of a tokenomics-driven market future underscore this trend. We expect in 2024 there will be increased institutional support for use cases that are designed to bring that reform, such as Figure's use of the Provenance blockchain.  In sum, our collective outlook for 2024 is that the crypto community has an opportunity to champion a narrative emphasizing zero tolerance for fraud and highlighting clear use cases. This approach could reshape perceptions of crypto, fostering trust and setting the stage for a year marked by significant growth and innovation.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,Beth Haddock,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/27/crypto-had-reputational-issues-this-year-2024-will-change-that,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6d9539b9547fedeeac9280844edbcdcc9cfdaf67-1114x806.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin To Experience Pullback Beforehand On Tuesday, December 26, CryptoCon took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his latest projections on Bitcoin. According to the analyst, the price of BTC will reach the $130,000 mark, but it might undergo a correction beforehand. In the X post, CryptoCon reiterated his opinion that, many weeks ago, Bitcoin peaked at roughly $45,000. He further highlighted that the LMACD includes another layer with a cross of the “Descending Cycle Mid-Top Trend.” Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Bitcoin 400% Surge To $200,000, Here’s When He suggests that Bitcoin is about to experience a “significant pullback.” The analyst highlighted that the “correction ranges from 38% to 52%” from its peak of around $45,000. In addition, CryptoCon predicts that a period of correction lasting “up to five to six months” will follow the correction. He added that these declines would cease in May 2024, as he sees an upward trajectory despite his correction projections. The crypto analyst highlighted the “Green Year Accumulation” phase in his projections. He then underscored the opportunity this correction offers investors who couldn’t take advantage of favorable entry during this phase. He sees an opportunity for investors to enter the Bitcoin market at a “more reasonable” price during this possible correction. However, overleveraged long may suffer due to the potential correction from the recent highs. Furthermore, the analyst continued by pointing out the advantages of Bitcoin’s future performance. He expects Bitcoin to reach a fresh peak in November or December 2025. CryptoCon’s predictions for BTC to reach an all-time high by the time above were based on the “Halving Cycles Theory.” He then asserted that after careful price experiments, he expects BTC to be around “$130,000 by the end of 2025.” Rise In BTC’s Addresses Holding Millions Of Dollars A recent report has revealed an uptick in the total number of Bitcoin millionaires in 2023. Data from BitInfoCharts shows the number of BTC millionaires has increased by 246% in 2023. Related Reading: Bitcoin Addresses In Loss Soar To One-Month High Amid Mixed Market Indicators Currently, Bitcoin millionaires are around 97,497, according to the data provided by the platform. This indicates a notable growth compared to this year, with 23,795 addresses worth at least $1 million. Furthermore, BitinfoCharts has divided these 97,497 millionaires into two distinct parts. Addresses that contain at least $1 million are 90,040, while those containing more than $10 million make up for the rest. This uptick can be traced back to the rise in BTC’s price this year, which has seen a year-to-date gain of nearly 158%. Earlier this year, the price of BTC was around $16,000.

The decision, announced last week, rescinds a 2021 directive against institutions facilitating cryptocurrency transactions. At the time, the central bank was forced to clarify that it was not prohibiting crypto trading in the country. However, adoption continued with users switching to peer-to-peer trading.  Lifting restrictions on crypto exchanges and other service providers from opening bank accounts could boost adoption, with high-profile players like pan-African exchange Yellow Card saying it will seek a crypto license in the country under frameworks introduced in May this year.  “With the new policy fostering a regulated environment, Yellow Card anticipates a surge in user adoption and engagement in the coming months,"" Lasbery Oludimu, the company's chief data protection officer, told local news outlet Nairametrics on Wednesday.

The company's Executive Chairman, Michael Saylor, tweeted that MicroStrategy bought the bitcoin at an average price of $42,110 per bitcoin.  The recent purchase pushes the company's holdings to 189,150 BTC worth around $5.9 billion, which was bought at an average price of $31,168 per BTC.  MicroStrategy began purchasing bitcoin in August 2020. The company's most recent purchasebefore Wednesday's took place last month, where it purchased 16,130 BTC, worth around $608 million at the time.  In a separate filing, the company said it had raised $610.1 million from its previously announced at-the-market (ATM) shares offering of $750 million.  The company was sitting on around $2 billion in profit from its bitcoin holdings as of early December.  This comes as bitcoin price has been climbing over the past few months amid optimism that U.S. regulators could potentially approve exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold BTC, a move some experts believe will prompt a flood of investment into the cryptocurrency.

If the breakout is confirmed, a rally to this level could be coming. Polygon Weekly Price Is On The Verge Of Breaking Out Of A Symmetrical Triangle In a new post on X, analyst Ali talked about a pattern that has been forming in the weekly price of MATIC. The pattern in question is called the “symmetrical triangle.” As its name suggests, this technical pattern looks like a triangle. There are two main trendlines in this formation; the upper one is made by connecting a series of tops, while the lower one joins together bottoms. A feature of the pattern is that these two trendlines converge at about the same incline (which is why it has “symmetrical” in its name). Related Reading: Fantom (FTM) To Rocket Up To $1.60 If This Happens: Analyst There are other triangle patterns in technical analysis as well, like the ascending and descending triangles. These patterns, for example, differ from the symmetrical triangle in that they have one trendline moving horizontally, while the symmetrical triangle has both of them at a slope. As is generally the case with patterns like this, the upper trendline in the symmetrical triangle can act as a source of resistance, while the lower one may provide support. Sustained breaks out of either of these levels can lead to a continuation of the trend in that direction. According to Ali, Polygon’s weekly price has been on the verge of such a breakout recently. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that highlights this potential break brewing in MATIC: Looks like the price has approached the upper trendline recently | Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the above graph, Polygon’s weekly price has recently surged toward the upper trendline of a symmetrical triangle pattern and appears to be trying to break out. “A sustained weekly candlestick close above $0.96 could propel MATIC towards $1.73,” explains the analyst. So far, Polygon seems to be well on its way to confirming this breakout, as its price has shot up more than 19% during the last 24 hours. If the symmetrical triangle break indeed holds up, then MATIC would have to rally another 66% from the current price if the target set by Ali is to be met. MATIC Has Surpassed The $1 Level For The First Time Since April Polygon has enjoyed some sharp bullish momentum during the past week as its price has now reclaimed $1, a level that the cryptocurrency hasn’t visited since April.

The only cryptocurrency in the market cap top 20 list that has shown better returns is Solana (SOL) with its about 47% profits. It’s currently unknown whether MATIC can keep up this rally, but if it can, the symmetrical triangle break would be confirmed and more surge would potentially follow.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Grayscale Investments, whose application to turn its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a U.S. spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) is being considered by the Securities and Exchange Commission, said Barry Silbert resigned as chairman and will be replaced by Mark Shifke. Shikfe , chief financial officer of GrayscaleownerDCG , will replace Silbert as of Jan. 1, Grayscale said in an SEC filing without giving a reason for the changes. Mark Murphy, DCG's president, also resigned from the board. The SEC has delayed several ETF applications including those of Grayscale, BlackRock, Ark 21shares, Vaneck and Hashdex, many of which have met with the regulator and filed amended documentation as year-end approaches. The agency must approve or reject Ark 21Shares, the first deadline to approach, by Jan. 10.  High funding rates, relatively low liquidity and reports of crypto exchange Mt. Gox starting repayments to victims of its 2014 hack spurred a marketwide decline in the past 24 hours, bringing losses to leveraged bullish traders. In the futures market, traders betting on higher prices lost over $190 million to liquidations as bitcoin (BTC) dropped as much as 4% before recovering early Wednesday. Some $45 million of those losses stemmed from altcoin-tracked futures in an unusual move – with bitcoin liquidations accounting for a smaller $36 million. Traders of Solana’s SOL tokens took on nearly $20 million in losses, while those of Bitcoin protocol Ordinals (ORDI) lost $8 million, data from Coinglass shows. Crypto exchange Binance saw over $97 million in liquidations, the most among counterparties.  South Korea is making crypto and other asset holdings of approximately 5,800 public officials available to the public under new legislation aimed at increasing transparency. Starting next year, public officials will be provided with an integrated asset disclosure service, South Korea's Ethics Policy Division said in a post on Wednesday. While asset disclosures are currently reported in official gazettes, under the new legislation, the information will be available through the Public Official Ethics System (PETI). New laws requiring public officials to disclose their crypto holdings were passed in May following a high-profile scandal involving a lawmaker.  Chart of The Day  The chart shows a seven-day moving average of transaction fees paid on the Bitcoin blockchain since January.  The average jumped to 445.59 BTC on Dec. 20, reaching the highest since 2018.  The rising popularity of Ordinals has led to blockchain congestion, pushing fees higher.

Happy holidays, and we'll see you next year!  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Buckle up, folks  The narrative  As is now this newsletter's annual tradition, CoinDesk's regulation team explains what we're paying attention to in 2024.  Why it matters  Next year will be busy. Crypto is having a resurgent moment, and this past year's conviction of Sam Bankman-Fried and guilty plea from Changpeng Zhao, the potential approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund and just a general upswing in the market are sure to have a lot of people feeling hopeful about this industry's future. But lawmakers and regulators aren't likely to spend less time on crypto issues either.  Breaking it down  Nikhilesh De: There's no rest for the weary. Though a lot happened in 2023, including an entire criminal trial, next year promises to be much busier. I'm interested in five main categories of events or activities that may play out next year: Court cases, elections, regulatory agency actions, legislation and the broader crypto market.  Court cases  Obviously the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has had a pretty active year, with lawsuits against Coinbase, Kraken and Binance/Binance.US over the past 12 months (really the past seven). While the regulator's case against Ripple shows us that it may take a while for these cases to resolve, we'll still start seeing how the courts view the arguments being made.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission will likewise have an interesting role next year. CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam has said on a number of public occasions that he's proud of how many enforcement actions his agency's taken, and that's not likely to let up next year.  Beyond that, there's also the national security and criminal cases. USA v. Avi Eisenberg, Roman Storm, Alex Mashinsky, Changpeng Zhao and even Samuel Bankman-Fried (round 2) will see federal prosecutors raise some interesting legal questions for the crypto industry.  Bankman-Fried and Zhao both have sentencing hearings coming up in the first half of the new year. Zhao is looking at 10-18 months or so when he's sentenced in late February 2024 after pleading guilty to one charge of violating the Bank Secrecy Act as the former CEO of Binance.  Bankman-Fried, of course, faces a much longer sentence after a jury convicted him on seven different charges in early November. He also faces a potential second trial. We may not know for a few more months whether the DOJ intends to proceed on the second trial, which is currently scheduled to begin in early March. If prosecutors move forward, Bankman-Fried's sentencing, currently set for later in March, will probably be delayed.  The Eisenberg and Storm cases will be more interesting, just from the legal theories we're going to see discussed.  Eisenberg, who was arrested a year ago today, is accused of commodities manipulation and fraud after executing a ""trading strategy"" that resulted in Mango Markets losing $114 million. His trial is currently scheduled for April.  Storm, meanwhile, faces charges of conspiracy to operate a money transmitter, facilitate money laundering and sanctions evasion tied to his work as a developer on Tornado Cash, a crypto mixing service.  The bankruptcies are moving closer to resolutions, and we'll continue watching them to see what exactly these companies' former users will get back.  Elections  We're going to be watching (and reporting on) elections in the U.S., European Union, India, Indonesia and possibly the UK next year. Each of these elections will be important – even if the winners don't have explicit positions on cryptocurrency issues, the department or ministry heads they appoint and the laws they push for will obviously have an impact on the crypto sector.  In the U.S., we're once again looking at elections at every level of government, from state and local issues to the House of Representatives and Senate to the office of the U.S. president. Campaign season is already in full swing, but within the next few weeks we'll start to see primary candidates dwindle.  It's still not clear to me that crypto will really be an issue for lawmakers in the U.S. beyond being generic talking points but we'll see.  Agencies and legislation  No major crypto legislation advanced out of Congress this year, though stablecoin and market structure bills made more progress than any previous legislation. We'll likely see these bills continue to be discussed this upcoming year, though of course the election will be a major wrinkle.  The people to watch are Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the House Financial Services Chair who's not running for reelection; Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the House Financial Services Ranking Member; Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) the Senate Banking Committee Chair, who is running for reelection; and Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.), who briefly ran for president.  McHenry has already told Politico he intends to push forward with crypto legislation during his final term. Still, he's up against a clock: At some point, Congress is going to be more focused on elections and campaigning than on their work in D.C.  Similarly, we'll see if federal regulators engage in further rulemaking, as well as which outstanding proposed rules they adopt.  The broader market  Of course, we can't ignore the fact that prices are up, people are booking paper returns (and some actual returns) and that there's a lot of excitement around. Whether things are different this time in terms of resilient platforms or market structures, and whether people are better protected against losing billions of dollars, will both affect how regulators worldwide look at this industry.  Looking back  This time last year, I predicted that questions about user data on bankrupt platforms will get more airtime; that the SEC would take more actions, that I wouldn't expect much in terms of legislation and that regulators would have a reaction to 2022's collapse. I think some of these predictions held up pretty well: The SEC sued a number of exchanges and legislation advanced out of committee but has yet to clear any major body of Congress. I don't think enough time has passed for us to clearly see the regulatory response to the collapse of FTX and other companies, but lawmakers are clearly thinking about these issues.  Sandali Handagama (EMEA): In my heads-up for 2023, I said we’d hear quite a bit about global norms for crypto. Well, the watchdogs really came through – and with gusto.  The Financial Stability Board (FSB) published its long-teased policy recommendations for crypto. In a separate paper with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), it also declared wholesale crypto bans just won’t work. But that hasn’t translated into easier rules for the sector, which saw the law catch up to several of its former champions this year.  Case in point: crypto’s theoretically less volatile subset, stablecoins, are getting some global-level tough love. International securities regulator IOSCO in its policy recommendations rejected industry pleas for stablecoins to receive special treatment. Banking regulator BCBS followed that up with plans to tighten requirements for stablecoins to qualify as safer assets for bank exposures. We’ll see a lot more tweaking or introducing of new standards for crypto and stablecoins next year.  If 2023 was the year of crypto regulation, 2024 will see some of those rules in action. The European Union’s landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation is set to come into effect next December after its finalization this year. In 2024, companies and EU member states will race to become MiCA compliant. As my former colleague Jack Schickler predicted, companies have indeed been playing some hopscotch, trying to pick the best EU country to settle down in time for the rules.  I’ll also be watching the EU’s parliamentary elections in 2024. Although MiCA’s through, there are plenty more relevant frameworks in the making, including one for the metaverse and another for a digital euro.  We’ll get a better feel for fresh 2023 regulatory regimes in aspiring crypto hubs Dubai and Hong Kong. We’re also expecting more legislation from several jurisdictions including Turkey and South Korea.  Let’s just say that, going into a new year and a new bull run, regulators worldwide have tried to make sure to be in a better position to tell crypto how to stay in line. But my most confident prediction is that campaigning by central banks and standard-setters to convince the masses that central bank digital currencies (CBDC) are better for payments than private crypto will continue into next year. Safe bet.  Jesse Hamilton (U.S.): From the vantage point of Washington, D.C., my predictions for crypto's 2024 will be wholly unsatisfying for those eagerly awaiting progress.  The best the industry can likely expect is some resolution in its court clashes with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), though the agency is probably going to hammer the sector with targeted new policy. We also have a strong chance of seeing a crypto legislation surge set a new high-water mark in 2024, with passage in the House of Representatives of some digital assets regulation.  Take my predictions this year with some caution, though, because last year I'd suggested the ""future could be decided"" in 2023 on whether crypto could move forward in the U.S. as a widespread, commonly exchanged asset. In fact, nothing much was decided -- except that the SEC isn't always right, according to federal judges in multiple cases.  Though I'd predicted that Congress would probably take months to ""find common ground on crypto,"" that ground was never located on the Senate side. A prediction about 2023 would have been better to have read: Expect policy chaos, legal clashes, massive enforcement actions and a small amount of legislative progress.  While an outgoing Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, may find a way to set his crypto legacy by winning House passage for crypto stablecoin regulation, the Senate has been reluctant about doing business on digital assets bills. Anybody who can see into the heart of Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and read his crypto intentions, please let me know.  While sideshows like the central bank digital currency (CBDC) debate continue, the most impactful policy moves from the U.S. government could be in finalization of truly consequential rules from the SEC and the Internal Revenue Services that would specifically regulate aspects of the U.S. industry for the first time. More than one of these initiatives spell devastation for decentralized finance (DeFi) if they emerge as they were proposed.  As 2024 looms, the industry is finding it more pleasant to focus on the likelihood of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) getting an SEC nod. But the SEC has multiple crypto rules loosely targeted for April, according to its agenda, including one that would expand the definition of exchanges to include crypto platforms and another that would order investment advisers to keep their customers' crypto assets with ""qualified custodians"" -- not the current range of industry exchanges, according to SEC chief Gary Gensler. (Though these rules could eventually be challenged in court, just like everything else.)  The takeaway: If you enjoyed 2023 (sicko!), you'll probably really like 2024.  Amitoj Singh (India): The world’s largest democracy goes to elections next year and by June 2024, based on current state election trends and polls, Narendra Modi will return as India’s Prime Minister for a third term. With it, the same policies represented by his party, the Bharatiya Janta Party, are likely to be retained. That would mean India’s controversial and stiff crypto taxation policy may not see a change in 2024. A think tank study supports reducing the taxes – a 30% tax on crypto profits and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on all transactions. The crypto industry has advocated for changes too. But Modi’s government hasn’t given any indication of wanting to change that policy. As for a crypto or Web3-specific legislative bill, Jayant Sinha, one of India's senior lawmakers from Modi’s party overseeing the financial evolution of the nation, has already said that won’t happen anytime soon and perhaps not until mid-2025. As a result, in 2024, India’s crypto enthusiasts may not have much hope for a reduction in taxation policies, but they will be looking out for piecemeal measures for the Web3 and blockchain industry to be folded into the nation’s further push toward digitizing its future. Modi’s government has already made encouraging steps for the space while maintaining a separate stiff policy for crypto assets. I’ll be keeping an eye on two separate budget presentations in India’s parliament, one before the election and one after, to see if India’s prioritization of framing a crypto framework for the globe as the president of the Group of 20 (G20) nations in 2023, becomes its own domestic legislative priority. As suggested in 2022, I watched the Modi government’s budget presentations in 2023 and its G20 work closely. I also watched whether the Indian central bank’s hopes to launch a full-scale central bank digital currency (CBDC) would come true. They didn’t. However, wholesale and retail pilots have shown promising results and their progress, including concerns around privacy, maybe the focus of 2024.  Camomile Shumba (UK): Last year I said that the U.K. government needed to provide more clarity on how it wants to regulate crypto. Now a year on I can say that the government's vision for the burgeoning sector has become clearer.  A lot of legislation has passed, meaning the U.K. is moving forward with its plans to be a crypto hub – a desire that according to the U.K. government comes hand in hand with regulation.  The Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA) – which gave regulators more power over the crypto sector – passed into law in June along with a crime bill that will help law enforcement agencies seize crypto.  The FCA enforced its promotions rules for crypto – which meant that overseas firms could not reach out to U.K. clients without the FCA's greenlight but this led to crypto firms leaving the country. Firms will be looking to adapt to these rules.  The U.K. will continue to struggle with managing its crypto hub ambition with the FCA's tendency to be strict. Plus, the U.K.'s staged approach where it deals with one aspect of crypto at a time means that different aspects of the crypto market will be left in limbo until regulations come out. The digital pound consultation results are still yet to come out.  With the election likely to occur next year – and Labour being a popular candidate – another question on everyone's lips is – if Labour were to take over – what would they change?  Elizabeth Napolitano (U.S.): The cryptocurrency industry has a busy (and seemingly brighter) year ahead of it. Shortly after ringing in 2024, we can expect to see the SEC approve its first swath of spot bitcoin ETFs, which could impel institutional investors to pour big bucks into the digital assets space. News of the approvals may also stir up public interest in virtual tokens, pushing them further from the fringes of finance to center stage.  Across the Atlantic, next year will also prove an exciting one for crypto. In late 2024, we'll finally see MiCA, the European Union's (EU) regulatory framework for crypto, take effect. The legislation effectively bans algorithmic stablecoins (think: DAI), which are often used as collateral for borrowing and lending across decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Curve Finance and Uniswap. This facet of the framework will likely have second-order effects on the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) across the EU's 27 member states, stymieing Europeans' engagement in a vastly profitable, if perilous, sector of the crypto industry.

Shoot me a note with your name or handle and interest in the space and your note may appear in a future edition of State of Crypto.  Stories you may have missed  Prometheum Earns Final Regulatory Nod to Try Hand at Fully-Compliant Crypto: Prometheum, a company hoping to become the first SEC-compliant crypto trading platform, now has FINRA approval to clear and settle trades.

With its lawsuit against Gemini, Genesis and Digital Currency Group, the NYAG's office looks like it's still trying to consolidate some greater authority over digital currency transactions.  (The New York Times) The Times dug into court filings in a case where a New York University student also happens to own a majority share in a bitcoin mining operation. It's an interesting look at how the facility was purchased and how the funds were moved.

42418928,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUD7Ij,1703681492,"Crypto Users Lost $2B to Hacks, Scams and Exploits in 2023, De.Fi Says","Cryptocurrency users lost nearly $2 billion to scams, rug pulls and hacks in 2023, roughly half last year's amount.  While the reduction is largely attributed to improved security protocols, the industry remains susceptible to security risks.  Cryptocurrency users lost nearly $2 billion to scams, rug pulls and hacks in 2023, roughly half the amount of last year, but a sign that the industry remains susceptible to security risks, researchers at security app De.Fi said in their annual report on Wednesday.  The reduction, largely attributed to the implementation of improved security protocols, increased awareness within the community and the overall decreased activity in the market, is even greater when the $40 billion lost to the collapses of stablecoin issuer Terraform Labs, crypto lender Celsius and the FTX exchange are taken into account.  The drop coincides with a bear market in which some major alternative tokens slumped as much as 85% from their 2021 peaks before recovering in the past few months as conditions turned more bullish. Additionally, the recovery rate of funds improved significantly to around 10%, up from just 2% in 2022, De.Fi said.  Losses by blockchains  Ethereum, the biggest blockchain by active users and value locked, experienced the highest losses, with about $1.35 billion erased in an estimated 170 incidents. This figure is indicative of Ethereum's appeal to malicious actors due to its extensive ecosystem and high-profile projects. The largest exploit was July's $230 million attack on the cross-chain platform Multichain.  BNB Chain also proved an attractive target, with $110.12 million lost across 213 incidents. Emerging network zkSync Era lost $5.2 million in two incidents and Solana had a loss of $1 million in a single attack.  Losses on centralized platforms, such as exchanges and trading platforms, totaled some $256 million across seven cases. The largest, November's attack on Poloniex, netted $122 million.  Popular methods  Access control exploits were by far the most damaging, with attackers taking advantage of weaknesses in how permissions and access rights are managed within smart contracts or platforms. Such exploits often grant unauthorized access to funds or critical functionalities and resulted in losses of more than $852 million out of 29 instances.  Flash-loan attacks were the second-most cash-generative method, leading to $275 million lost over 36 cases. These attacks exploit the uncollateralized loan feature in decentralized finance (DeFi), allowing attackers to borrow large amounts of cryptocurrency without upfront capital. Attackers use these borrowed funds to manipulate market prices and exploit vulnerabilities in DeFi.  Exit scams accounted for $136 million over 263 cases. In such an exploit, a rogue developer simply drains all liquidity from a token they have issued or removes their online presence after raising money from unsuspecting market participants.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/12/27/crypto-users-lost-2b-to-hacks-scams-and-exploits-in-2023-defi-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8e0c7749afacc68b95131f116f3c7f4f4cbbf91-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

21810535,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=567088,1703678428,"Crypto Trading Firm Expects Bitcoin To Crash To $36,000, Here’s Why","A recent market update by the trading firm QCP Capital has provided insights into how Bitcoin’s price would react if a Spot Bitcoin ETF gets approved in January. The firm predicts that there could be a major retracement before any move to the upside. Bitcoin Could Retrace To $36,000 QCP Capital predicts that Bitcoin could retrace to around $36,000 before an uptrend resumes. At the same time, they expect Bitcoin to face a topside resistance between the $45,000 and $48,500 region. These projections are based on what they expect to happen if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves Spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. Related Reading: Harmony To See Redemption? Analyst Predicts Meteoric 650% Rise For ONE Token QCP Capital is of the opinion that the actual demand for these investment funds might fall short of market expectations at the beginning. If so, it set things up for the classic ‘sell the news’ scenario, which would cause Bitcoin’s price to dump. The trading firm had previously opined that Bitcoin could hit its all-time high of $69,000 if these Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw enough capital upon launching. Then, they also warned that approval could end up being a sell-the-news event if inflows into these funds were below par. Now, they seem to be suggesting that the latter is likely to happen. However, they don’t expect that Bitcoin will stay down for too long as they are confident that Bitcoin’s recent resurgence will continue at some point. They estimate that this will likely happen after a few weeks, especially as traders position for a strong rally ahead of the next big thing – the Bitcoin Halving. This event is projected as what will spark the next bull run. BTC price at $43,278 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com All Attention Will Turn To Ethereum Ethereum might be the next big play once the pending Spot Bitcoin ETFs are approved. QCP Capital foresees the market’s anticipation, quickly turning to the Ethereum Spot ETFs. Just like with the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, a number of asset managers have also filed to launch a fund that offers direct exposure to Ethereum. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Hit $1.33 ‘Pretty Fast’ In anticipation of a potential approval of the Ethereum Spot ETFs, some crypto investors could move their capital from BTC to ETH ahead of an expected rally in Ethereum’s price. The trading firm stated that they are “leaning against very strong support in the ETHBTC cross at the 0.051 level.” QCP Capital, however, believes that any approval of an Ethereum Spot ETF is still “many months away.” In the meantime, they expect that Ethereum’s price will notable rallies based on such speculations. This could be something similar to what happened with Bitcoin, as the flagship cryptocurrency enjoyed significant rallies on the back of the Spot BTC approval rumors.

42418943,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUD7W9,1703674059,BONK Falls 13% as Solana Ecosystem Sees Profit Taking After Memecoin Frenzy,"The Solana ecosystem allure seemed to lull this week as native tokens from major projects by market capitalization snapped down from multiweek bull runs hinting at profit-taking from early investors.  Data from Coingecko shows meme coin bonk (BONK) fell 13% in the past 24 hours, dogwifhat (WIF) dropped 15%, while smaller but hyped token analos (ANALOS) dropped over 50%.  Tokens of decentralized exchange Orca (ORCA) slid 9%, while Jito's JTO - a governance token - dropped 6%. SOL prices slumped approximately 4% before recovering, with futures traders taking on $13 million in losses in liquidations the past 24 hours.  Pullbacks were likely a sign of profit-taking from early investors in these projects, who probably made significant returns on their initial positions as prices jumped.  Meanwhile, trading volumes on Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX) applications remained high, with tokens worth $1.44 billion changing hands in the past 24 hours. That accounted for 26% of all DEX trading volumes across the crypto space, higher than usual players Ethereum, Arbitrum and BNB Chain.  The Solana ecosystem boomed early this month as bonk tokens started a multiweek run of over 1,000%, grabbing listings on influential exchanges Binance and Coinbase.  That seemingly kickstarted activity on the network, with prices of Solana's Saga phone flying to over $5,000 – despite being unable to sell out as recently as October – and SOL market capitalization quickly flipping other large tokens.  Solana also became the strongest draw among on-chain traders, metrics from last week show, with trading volumes and network fees crossing those of Ethereum – usually the highest – on a seven-day rolling basis.  Hype for the blockchain's speedy transactions, cheap fees, and a lottery of meme coin issuances seemingly jumpstarted the network since early December, pushing SOL token prices to nearly $120 from $38 at the start of November.  Value locked on Solana applications grew in tandem, rising to $1.3 billion worth of tokens from the $400 million mark in November to reach levels previously seen in July 2022.  But the quick flips on small-cap tokens seemed to have attracted hoards of new memecoin issuances, most of which last just a few days before falling as much as 90%.  Rug pulls, a term for a developer erasing liquidity from a token they issued, seem to run rampant as of Wednesday, data from Birdeye shows.",NEGATIVE,SOL | BONK,BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | BONK,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/27/bonk-falls-13-as-solana-ecosystem-sees-profit-taking-after-memecoin-frenzy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b1f4d47509c03b5dea770a2808412b2d0fd2dca-2433x1369.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The narrative of Bitcoin’s triumph doesn’t stop there. Surpassing national currencies with ease, Bitcoin continued its meteoric rise, outshining even the venerable Swiss Franc. By achieving a staggering market capitalization of $830 billion, Bitcoin showcased not only its financial prowess but also its resilience in a landscape often defined by volatility.

This burgeoning excitement not only elevated Bitcoin’s market standing but also facilitated a noteworthy milestone. During this period of heightened anticipation, Bitcoin, with unwavering momentum, not only surpassed the valuation of the Swiss Franc but went a step further, closing in on the esteemed South Korean Won. The strategic alignment of market forces, coupled with growing investor confidence, played a pivotal role in this achievement, showcasing Bitcoin’s resilience and adaptability in responding to evolving market conditions. Bitcoin slides back into the $42K territory.

The Grayscale funds are trading at premiums due to technical and regulatory constraints on owning altcoins outside of regulated market vehicles. The possibility of SEC delays and the mismatch between staking and ETF liquidity makes the conversion of ETHE to an ETF uncertain. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) is a closed-end fund that trades at a discount to a net asset value of 10.6%. The discount to net asset value has narrowed considerably over the past few months. Data by YCharts Bitcoin appreciated a lot during 2023, and altcoins didn't take long to follow along. I've been invested in the Ethereum Trust and wrote it up on The Special Situations Report , together with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ), back when it traded at $6 and held $10.50 worth of Ethereum. As things stand now, I'm not a huge fan of buying into ETHE. I still like GBTC if hedged . I don't have a view on Ethereum but just on this Grayscale vehicle that's primarily used to get exposure to Ethereum. The discounts on Grayscale's funds have narrowed substantially from where they were during the latest crypto bear market. Many are now trading at a substantial premia even: SYMBOL | NAME AUM HOLDINGS/SHARE MARKET PRICE/SHARE Discount/premia GBAT Grayscale Basic Attention Token Trust $1,441,779.32 $2.32 $9.40 305.1724138 BCHG Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust $71,772,701.50 $2.06 $4.18 102.9126214 GBTC Grayscale Bitcoin Trust $27,077,421,076.56 $39.11 $36.91 -5.625159806 GLNK Grayscale Chainlink Trust $4,613,101.92 $14.37 $57.75 301.8789144 MANA Grayscale Decentraland Trust $9,176,812.72 $4.84 $14.95 208.8842975 ETCG Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust $251,340,775.40 $17.96 $12.65 -29.56570156 ETHE Grayscale Ethereum Trust $6,861,827,241.94 $22.12 $19.77 -10.6238698 FILG Grayscale Filecoin Trust $578,948.34 $5.20 $42.56 718.4615385 HZEN Grayscale Horizen Trust $6,037,080.09 $0.88 $1.75 98.86363636 LTCN Grayscale Litecoin Trust $109,124,842.54 $6.34 $13.60 114.511041 GLIV Grayscale Livepeer Trust $5,218,219.37 $8.49 $24.95 193.8751472 GSOL Grayscale Solana Trust $21,493,846.35 $36.64 $167.85 358.1058952 GXLM Grayscale Stellar Lumens Trust $9,225,907.57 $11.16 $31.96 186.3799283 ZCSH Grayscale Zcash Trust $9,775,949.93 $2.59 $2.89 11.58301158 The Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ethereum classic trusts are the remaining funds trading at discounts. I think Ethereum Classic is not a hot crypto and, therefore not in high demand. The premia on various other funds are surprising. It is a very rare sight to see closed-end funds trade at such high premiums to NAV. The default for the universe is to trade at a discount. There is a lot of variability in the discounts but most of them trade at a discount between 1% to 20%. It is surprising because you could just buy these cryptos through a trusted crypto exchange (if something like that exists) or self-custody these cryptos instead of paying 2.5% fees. The funds are trading at a premium because 1) some crypto traders are technical or quantitatively oriented and follow price signals (predicting surging prices lead to further short-term upside), and 2) there are professional traders that are constrained to U.S. Tradfi assets. They simply don't have the infrastructure or legal right to own altcoins outside of regulated market vehicles. For these investors, these Grayscale funds are one of the few ways to express these altcoin trades. 3) U.S. investors can own the Grayscale vehicles in tax-advantaged accounts. Ethereum and Bitcoin are easier to access in tradfi markets. There are different ways to own Ethereum and Bitcoin including futures markets that are loved by hedge funds and traders. That's why I never expect these funds to start trading at a premium again. In the case of the Bitcoin fund, there is an ongoing push to convert it into an ETF. The SEC has been sandbagging this attempt for a long time but the court has ruled this isn't right and now it should happen imminently. The court ruled that the SEC's denial of its application was ""arbitrary and capricious"" because it did allow Bitcoin futures ETF. For Ethereum, Grayscale is also applying to get an ETF approved, but I'm not nearly as confident this will result in an imminent conversion. The market seems to believe the probabilities are much closer aligned than I: Data by YCharts There are a few reasons. For starters, Ethereum holders can theoretically benefit from staking their cryptos (resulting in a yield). If you don't stake you're not earning any compensation for the dilution you're experiencing. Offering products on cryptos you can stake but don't is like offering real estate funds where you don't bother collecting the rent. It doesn't pass the sniff test of a responsible product. The staking is also a technical difference and complication that wasn't there with Bitcoin. In years past, the SEC has delayed and hindered the crypto-industry on many occasions. Whether justified or not, I don't expect them to change that behavior. Meanwhile, the Ethereum trust is trading at only a 10% discount. If an ETF is approved, that leads to an 11% return. If I were interested in capturing that 11%, I would definitely do so by hedging out the Ethereum exposure. I believe it's currently quite advantageous to offset the inherent exposure to Ethereum. This strategy allows me to secure approximately an 11% return while essentially committing no significant capital. I can take a long position in ETHE and balance it by shorting between 100%-110% of that position through Ethereum futures or the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT). This results in minimal or nearly zero market exposure to Ethereum, depending on the hedging ratio. If Grayscale is allowed to convert ETHE to an ETF this would result in an 11% return as the spread would instantly approximate zero on conversion. In closed-end fund arbitrage, fully mitigating the risk associated with the underlying asset is often a complex task. At times the asset comprises numerous components, sometimes the full composition is unknown, and frequently, the portfolio data is outdated. However, here it is quite straightforward because there is just one type of cryptocurrency in the fund. Instead, maintaining an unhedged position could lead to the inherent volatility overshadowing the 10% arbitrage target. Ethereum can surge by 24% or plunge by 22% any day. It wouldn't surprise me. If I believed the fund would convert within the next 6 months (which I don't) I don't want to pollute the predictable ""risk free"" 11% return with a bet that's much less attractive in terms of risk/reward. That's why I prefer the more stable returns of a hedged strategy both in this case and GBTC. The final reason I don't like ETHE here is because of the possibility that the SEC finds ways to delay a conversion of ETHE, there is a non-zero chance Grayscale may ultimately not pursue conversion. ETHE charges 2.5% on assets under management; there is almost $7 billion in the fund that doesn't get staked and can't leave. This is a beautiful fee stream. I can imagine staking could ultimately be realized in a closed-end fund but will be a very difficult feature to package into an ETF. ETF's offer immediate liquidity and staking for yield means you lock-up assets for a period of time. That's a crucial mismatch and that's why I don't think proof-of-stake protocols are well-suited to be held through ETF products. In Europe, they've been put in ETN's and I'm not sure that's wise. If the SEC doesn't allow staking in ETF's that would be a perfect excuse for Grayscale to refrain from converting this fund. If a scenario like that plays out I expect the discount to blow out to 20%+. I think the market is getting too excited about ETHE because there are also Ethereum futures. It looks like the rationale holds that if the judge says that Bitcoin spot ETFs have to be approved because Bitcoin futures have been approved, the same line of reasoning applies here. But I don't think that's precisely true. Futures are derivative products that promise a delivery of the underlying at a certain point in time. Because you can hold the promised product to deliver it at some point, the yield and/or cost-of-carry get reflected in the prices of these products. Then there are lots of other forces of demand and supply that can push prices up or down but big picture that's how it works. A futures product may not offer a yield but arbitrageurs could take advantage of that until it is more or less reflected in the futures prices. This isn't the case with an Ethereum ETF. In conclusion, while the Grayscale Ethereum Trust is an option for investors seeking exposure to Ethereum, there are multiple reasons why I don't like it. The narrowing discount to net asset value means there is little upside compared to outright Ethereum or alternative products. The path towards ETF conversion seems less straightforward than for Bitcoin. The complexities and potential inefficiencies of incorporating staking features into an ETF format raise questions whether proof-of-stake protocols belong in ETFs at all. I don't have a beef with Ethereum. I just don't think ETHE is worth it, at this narrow a discount.",NEUTRAL,ETC,ALTCOIN | ETC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4659885-im-not-fan-of-grayscale-ethereum-trust-at-10-64-percent-discount?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/21807424.jpeg

In futures market, traders betting on higher prices lost over $190 million to liquidations as bitcoin (BTC) dropped as much as 4% before recovering in Wednesday morning hours. Some $45 million of those stemmed from altcoin-tracked futures in an unusual move – with bitcoin liquidations accounting for a relatively lesser $36 million in losses.  Traders of Solana’s SOL tokens took on nearly $20 million in losses, while those of Bitcoin protocol Ordinals (ORDI) lost $8 million, data from Coinglass shows. Crypto exchange Binance saw over $97 million in liquidations, the most among counterparties.  The aforementioned liquidation figures are highest in recent weeks after a nearly $500 million flush-out in early December.  Liquidations occur when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position owing to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader cannot meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position, that is when they don't have sufficient funds to keep the trade open.  The drop came as the Mt. Gox crypto exchange appeared to be starting to repay customers who lost 850,000 bitcoin (BTC), now valued at around $36 billion, on Tuesday.

This deliberate reduction in the total supply by 40% has not only impressed investors but also earned PancakeSwap the endearing title of “everyone’s favorite DEX” (Decentralized Exchange). 🔥 10,166,225 $CAKE just burned – that’s $34M! 💰 Trading fees (AMM V2): 132k CAKE ($438k) -29% 💰 Trading fees (AMM V3): 79k CAKE ($260k) -23% 💰 Trading fees (Non-AMM like Perpetual, Position manager etc): 4k CAKE ($1k) -98% 🔮 Prediction: 34k CAKE ($112k) -27% 🎟️ Lottery &… pic.twitter.com/veRsDhcFFB — PancakeSwap🥞Everyone’s Favorite DEX (@PancakeSwap) December 26, 2023 Despite prevailing market consolidation, the CAKE token has managed to defy the odds, maintaining a price above $2.1 and extending its recovery trend. Within just one week, the coin’s price soared to the current trading value of $3.37, breaking decisively from a falling wedge pattern. This latest burn has resulted in a notable reduction in the circulating supply of CAKE tokens, decreasing from 275 million to 265 million. Consequently, this development propelled the CAKE price by 18%, pushing its market cap to $894 million. CAKE market cap currently at $896.764 million. Chart: TradingView.com Crypto burns play a pivotal role in the digital assets sector by reducing asset supply, thereby creating heightened demand and boosting the value and prices of cryptocurrencies. Although a proposal to cap the maximum supply at 450 million was previously made by the network to recover losses suffered by CAKE crypto, it is yet to be implemented. Meanwhile, the team will continue with substantial burns to support price movement until an alternative decision is reached. Weekly Token Burns Signal PanCakeSwap’s Commitment The PancakeSwap team has further disclosed their intention to continue these token burns on a weekly basis, demonstrating a commitment to this approach until a decision is made to alter it. This diminishing supply, coupled with the optimistic technical outlook, is anticipated to sustain a robust recovery trend in CAKE price. CAKE seven-day price action.

Meanwhile, the coin’s 24-hour trade volume increased by 37% to $284 million, with one-month gains exceeding 50%. Moreover, the token reached a new 30-day peak of $3.65 on Tuesday. As of the latest update, CAKE maintains a bullish stance, registering a 27% increase in the previous day’s trading and gaining over 6% within one hour of the most recent token burn. The altcoin has also garnered increased crowd interest, with daily volume soaring by 75% to $330 million, although it remains 90% down from its April 2021 all-time high of $44.20.

42418973,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUD9dF,1703662479,'Smart Money' Is Record Long on BTC Ahead of Expected Bitcoin ETF,"Data tracking website MacroMicro's bitcoin futures smart money index rose to a record 13,711 last week.  The record bias for bullish long positions comes days ahead of the SEC's impending decision on spot ETF applications.  Some obsevers foresee a classic ""sell the news"" price action following the ETF launch.  Smart money, or capital investments from institutional investors and knowledgeable market participants, is piling into bitcoin [BTC] as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) deadline to approve a spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) nears.  That's the message from Taiwan-based data tracking website MacroMicro's bitcoin futures smart money index, which tracks the spread between the large investors' long and short positions open on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The indicator is based on the CFTC's weekly Commitment of Traders report.  The smart money index rose to 13,711 last week, surpassing the previous peak of 13,603 to signal record net bullish positioning by asset managers and other reportables.  CME's cash-settled standard bitcoin futures contracts sized at 5 BTC are widely considered a proxy for institutional activity, allowing market participants to take exposure to the cryptocurrency through a regulated venue without having to own it.  Futures are derivative contracts that obligate the buyer to purchase an asset and the seller to sell an asset at a predetermined price at a later date. Going long means being obligated to buy the underlying asset and conveys a bullish bias. Going short suggests otherwise.  The smart money index has risen sharply this quarter amid the spot ETF narrative and strengthening expectations of a Fed rate cut in 2024.  The U.S. SEC has reportedly set Jan. 10 as the deadline for approving/rejecting an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that invests in bitcoin rather than futures tied to BTC. Observers expect record inflows into the asset class following the potential launch of one or more spot ETFs.  The bullish expectations have powered bitcoin higher by nearly 60% this quarter, opening doors for a potential ""sell the news"" price action following the launch.  ""As we finally approach the launch, we need to point out that it is likely that the actual demand for the BTC Spot ETF at the start will fall short of market expectations. This sets up a classic 'sell the news' scenario in the 2nd week of Jan,"" Singapore-based QCP Capital's market insights team said in an update published last week.  ""For this reason, we expect topside resistance for BTC in the $45,000-$48,500 region and a possible retracement to $36,000 levels before the uptrend resumes,"" QCP noted, adding that the bullish trend will likely resume ahead of April's mining reward halving.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/27/smart-money-is-record-long-on-btc-ahead-of-expected-bitcoin-etf,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d8d7972553621ce157e9c1b4d45809c493295e66-998x561.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Despite the challenges posed by the “Elastic exploit”, KyberSwap’s core business, including the aggregator and limit order functions, remains fully functional, according to the latest statement. Kyber Network Response To Elastic Exploit As stated by Tran, Kyber Network is preparing to launch the Zap API, this is expected to enable decentralized applications (dApps), wallets, and other projects to serve as convenient gateways for users to access DeFi liquidity protocols. Related Reading: Billionaire Tim Draper Predicts When The Bitcoin Price Will Reach $250,000 Additionally, Kyber Network has made operational changes, including temporary pauses in liquidity protocol initiatives and the KyberAI project, to “ensure a sustainable future”. Tran further stated: Regrettably, we have also reduced our workforce by 50%. The past few days have been among the most challenging in my journey as an entrepreneur. The decision to part ways with so many of our team members was heart-wrenching. Each individual is not only highly skilled but also deeply committed to advancing DeFi and bringing tangible value to end-users. Tran also stated that Kyber Network’s response to the Elastic exploit includes the implementation of the KyberSwap Elastic Exploit Treasury Grant Program, aimed at covering up to 100% of users’ losses. To provide clarity on the situation, Kyber Network has categorized the affected assets and outlined the consequences for each category. Treasury Grants For Victims According to the network’s blog post, Category 1 comprises affected assets taken from affected pools by the primary exploit, which commenced on November 22, 2023. This category includes liquidity positions and liquidity provider (LP) fees, with a market value of $48,883,930.66. Notably, the network has stated that these assets have yet to be recovered. Category 2 consists of affected assets taken from affected pools by subsequent activity, referred to as Category 2 Mimicking Bots (MBA). These assets, totaling US$172,148.52, were obtained by two mimicking bots that replicated the actions of the primary exploit. Similar to Category 1, these assets have yet to be recovered. Category 3 includes affected assets that were removed from affected pools by subsequent activity, collectively referred to as Category 3 Mimicking Bots (MBA), along with assets referred to as Category 3 swapped affected assets. While a portion of the affected assets were partially recovered, a portion of the assets were swapped into Category 3 Swapped affected assets. The market value of the Category 3 Affected Assets is $6,405,483.43, based on the last block before the Category 3 MBA. Assets falling under Category 4 are currently locked in affected pools due to an “incorrect pool state” resulting from the primary exploit and MBA. The total value of these assets is $24,478.93. This amount comprises different segments: $9,390.51 attributable to the primary exploit, $15,036.04 attributable to the Category 2 MBA, and $52.38 attributable to the Category 3 MBA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Millionaires Rise By 246% In 2023, Here’s How Many There Are Lastly, Category 5 represents affected assets that were previously locked in affected pools due to an incorrect pool state resulting from the primary exploit.

At present, the native token of Kyber, KNC, is trading at $0.732, indicating a marginal decline of 0.3% within the past 24 hours. Nevertheless, over the last fourteen days, the token has demonstrated notable growth, with gains surpassing 7%.

Fantom Might Be Forming A “W” Pattern In Its Weekly Chart As explained by analyst Ali in a new post on X, FTM’s weekly price chart has appeared to have been forming a “W” pattern recently. A W or double bottom refers to a pattern in technical analysis that ends with a bullish resurgence for the asset. The pattern forms when the price forms two consecutive bottoms after going through some significant downtrend and finally reverses its direction with a sharp bullish move. Related Reading: Polkadot Shows Bearish Signal, Analyst Predicts Drawdown To This Target While the pattern is known for its resemblance to the letter “W” from the English alphabet, the pattern can still form even if the “W” shape doesn’t quite look as symmetrical. Like this pattern, there is also the “M” or double top pattern, which forms when two consecutive tops follow an uptrend and the price subsequently shifts towards a downwards trajectory. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows how a potential W pattern may be forming for the weekly price of Fantom: The possible pattern forming in the asset's price | Source: @ali_charts on X As is apparent in the above graph, the Fantom weekly price formed its second bottom in October and has since been sharply going up. The pattern is indeed starting to resemble a W now, but it’s still not fully confirmed yet. In the chart, Ali has also highlighted the $0.57 level at which the coin hit the top between the two bottoms and it seems like the weekly price has been approaching this line recently. “If $FTM sustains a weekly close above $0.57, it will confirm this bullish formation and march toward $1.60!” notes the analyst. From the current spot price of the cryptocurrency, a rally towards this level would mean an increase of almost 192%. It now remains to be seen if the asset can confirm this pattern and go on a run like this or not. A few days back, the same analyst had discussed about the on-chain support and resistance levels for Fantom, revealing that the coin has little in terms of obstacles until the $0.66 level. The cost basis distribution around the various FTM ranges | Source: @ali_charts on X In the above chart, the data for each FTM price range in terms of the number of investors or addresses who bought their coins at them is displayed. The $0.45 to $0.47 range was filled with investors, but the asset has already cleared it. Generally, investors tend to show a selling reaction whenever the price of the asset retests their cost basis from below, as they might be tempted to just exit at their break-even point, rather than risk going into losses again. Related Reading: Worldcoin Shows Bullish Breakout, Analyst Predicts 80% Rally Ali had noted that with the dense zone clear, there were no more supply walls in sight for the cryptocurrency. The asset has been making its way up since then, mowing through these centers of relatively weak resistance. With the path appearing clear in terms of on-chain resistance and a W pattern beginning to form, a move towards higher levels may be coming for the asset.

21794197,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=567032,1703635258,"Forget High Gas Fee Challenges, Ethereum Remains Bullish: Time To Buy More?","Despite concerns over network congestion and high gas fees, Ethereum remains bullish in the long term, according to borovik.eth–a partner at Rollbit, who posted on X on December 26. The key factors driving the positive outlook are pointing to Ethereum’s developer ecosystem, its role in the broader blockchain ecosystem, and the launch of numerous Layer-2 solutions (L2s). Will Layer-2 Activity Drive ETH To New Highs? Borovik.eth remained deviant and optimistic about ETH, even with Solana (OSL) and other layer-1 coins like Cardano (ADA) soaring in 2023. In the analyst’s view, Ethereum’s scaling challenges are manageable, believing that developers will find ways of “resolving this concern permanently over the long term.” Related Reading: Worldcoin Shows Bullish Breakout, Analyst Predicts 80% Rally Based on this optimism, the Rollbit partner believes that ETH will likely recover strongly in the coming sessions considering the level of development, especially of layer-2 scaling options meant for the pioneer smart contract platform. According to Borovik.eth, the development of layer-2 off-chain options backed by massive companies, for instance, Coinbase, a crypto exchange, and venture capitalists (VCs), positions Ethereum (ETH) favorably for a bull run. As of December 26, ETH remains in an uptrend but is cooling off after solid gains in Q4 2023. At spot rates, ETH is underperforming most layer-1 platforms like Injective Protocol (INJ) and Solana (SOL), whose prices rallied, reaching new 2023 highs. ETH prices are still trending below $2,400, a critical resistance level. If bulls overcome this line, ETH may fly towards $3,500 or better in the months ahead. The spike in SOL’s valuation, especially in H2 2023, has led to a comparison with ETH. Even so, most traders are optimistic. Arthur Hayes recently stated that users should begin rotating funds from SOL to ETH, an endorsement of the second most valuable coin by market cap. Ethereum Layer-2s Manage Over $18.8 Billion While Ethereum faces challenges around on-chain scaling, developers have been working hard to resolve this issue. The release of layer-2 off-chain options using rollups has been key in this drive. Most of these solutions, including Arbitrum and Optimism, have been critical in alleviating pressure from the mainnet, thus reducing gas fees. According to L2Beat, layer-2 protocols manage over $18 billion as total value locked (TVL). There are also 34 active projects, with 23 more being developed. Among the big companies hitching the layer-2 ride is Coinbase, where through Base, users can transact cheaply while relying on the Ethereum mainnet for security. According to Borovik.eth, over 60% of Base’s revenue is from rollup fees charged, highlighting the importance of their scaling solution and the role Ethereum plays in all this.
