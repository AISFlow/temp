42400741,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKTkI,1511996429,Crypto Corrupts the Youth? South Korea Prime Minister Says So,"South Korea's prime minister is reportedly raising alarms about cryptocurrency's influence on young people as regulators draw up rules for the country's exchanges.  ""There are cases in which young Koreans including students are jumping in to make quick money and virtual currencies are used in illegal activities like drug dealing or multi-level marketing for frauds,"" Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon said in a statement translated from Korean by CNBC.  He added:  ""This can lead to serious distortion or social pathological phenomena, if left unaddressed.""      Accordingly, the South Korean leader called on government agencies such as the Ministry of Justice to look into the matter, CNBC reported.  Separately, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) is putting the finishing touches on proposed regulations for South Korea's exchanges, the Hankyoreh newspaper reported.  ""Cryptocurrency exchanges will be required to maintain standards for consumer protection, such as having separate deposits for customers’ assets, and for increasing transparency, such as having a procedure for confirming customers’ identity,"" the publication quoted an unnamed official as saying. ""The authorities will also be empowered to prosecute exchanges that break these rules.""  Crypto hotspot  These shots across the bow come as South Korea has emerged as a hub of trading activity in bitcoin and other crypto assets. The country is home to two of the top 10 bitcoin exchanges by volume, according to CoinMarketCap.  South Korean exchanges were the first places where the bitcoin price reached $10,000 in this week's run-up. During the third quarter, the South Korean Won passed the U.S. dollar as ether’s top trade pair, according to CoinDesk's latest quarterly State of Blockchain Report.  But South Korean regulators have already taken stern measures in the crypto asset market. In September, the FSC banned domestic initial coin offerings and declared violators would be dealt with in a Virtual Currency Detention Center.

42400736,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKTfN,1511990859,ICO Pros Call for Self-Regulation Citing SEC Risk,"The initial coin offering (ICO) community needs to embrace self-regulation now to lessen the blows likely to come from enforcement and regulatory actions, according to speakers at CoinDesk's Consensus: Invest yesterday.  A crackdown in the U.S. is inevitable, perhaps as soon as six to 12 months from now, warned Charles Hoskinson, CEO at Input Output and former CEO of the ethereum project.  This will likely occur once unsophisticated retail investors start to lose money in the space and run to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in search of recourse, he said during a panel discussion at the Tuesday conference in New York.  ""I do believe there's going to be some form of enforcement because, basically, what you have now is people offering [cookie-cutter ICO] services. It's all just semantics and structuring and so forth,"" Hoskinson said, adding that, while some projects may withstand scrutiny, many will not.  ""When you see these types of structures, maybe some of them are legitimate, but 80 or 90 percent will end up just being 'me too,'"" said Hoskinson.  Shining light?  Given that landscape, Matthew Roszak, co-founder and chairman of Bloq, argued that the ICO community in the U.S. needs to do a better job of self-regulating and self-policing, so that when regulation does come, its effects will be blunted.  Roszak explained:  ""There is a lot of froth and crappy ICOs out there. We as a community need to put our best foot forward to say 'Let’s start thinking about frameworks for best practices and self-regulate ourselves.'""  Another panelist, Olga Feldmeier, chief executive officer of Smart Valor, a blockchain finance startup based in Zug, Switzerland, offered the country's ICO community as an example. It is in the process of creating a self-regulatory body and a self-imposed code of conduct built around guiding principles such as transparency in vesting.  However, Feldmeier added that the example of Switzerland might not be easily extrapolated to the U.S. because it is a such a small jurisdiction that has a longstanding tradition of self-governance in financial services.  Preventative measure  Roszak, who is a founding member of the Token Alliance – a Chamber of Digital Commerce initiative that aims to develop best practices – added that taking steps now to ensure transparency and auditability, such as lockups during token sales and sound treasury management, will mitigate headaches down the road.  ""When [regulators] show up, the pendulum swing is usually overdone,"" Rozak said. ""But if we as a community say 'Let's self-regulate,' all these things will delay some of that regulatory friction that's going to be upon us.""

42400743,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKTmG,1511974824,Tokenized Fund-of-Funds to Raise $100 Million Via ICO,"A new fund-of-funds announced this week is aiming to raise up to $100 million via an initial coin offering (ICO).  Called the Apex Token Fund, the key idea is that tokenization gives buyers a way to cash out their investment early on, without diminishing the underlying principle.  Speaking exclusively to CoinDesk in a telephone call, Joseph Bradley, a fund co-founder, said:  ""The whole idea of applying a blockchain to this type of structure is it unlocks liquidity between the vintage and harvest date of raising the fund.""  Under the scheme, each token will represent a proportional piece of equity in the fund. Once the tokens are distributed to investors, they can start trading those tokens on exchanges. If one of the underlying funds spikes or drops in value and an investor wants to exit their position, they can do so without the need to follow the lockup rules typical at traditional hedge funds.  The fund tentatively plans to run a presale of the token – also called Apex – sometime in January, with a public sale in February. The fund will launch if a minimum of $25 million is raised, and has a hard cap of $100 million.  Apex Token Fund representatives declined to disclose which funds it has secured access to so far.  'Democratization of access'  Domiciled in the British Virgin Isles, U.S. investors will be excluded from holding Apex. There are more than 120 crypto hedge funds out there at this point, according to CNBC, including several funds-of-funds.  In fact, Bradley and Chris Keshian (another co-founder) also built Neural Capital, another crypto fund that launched in December 2016. They set up the new fund after realizing that many mainstream crypto investors have been excluded from the best performing hedge funds, limiting access to high-net-worth individuals.  Keshian said:  ""The idea behind this democratization of access is to allow your average crypto holders to gain exposure to these fund returns through these tokenized methods ... We also saw this space where a lot of people are investing in ICOs. They aren't necessarily investing because they believe in the technology. They are investing for these non-linear returns.""  While the returns can be large, crypto investors know the price volatility can be stomach-turning.  ""You can smooth out volatility by having a diversified investment approach in different investment strategies,"" Keshian said.  To this end, Apex will provide a balance of funds focused on price arbitrage, protocol focus, sentiment analysis and other strategies.  Finite lifespan  The first Apex Token Fund will eventually sunset, divesting from all of the underlying funds, at which point token holders will then be able to redeem their tokens for a proportional quantity of fiat currency. As tokens are redeemed, they will be destroyed until the fund is wound down completely.  By then, other Apex funds are planned to have launched.  ""We plan to do this in a number of capacities,"" Keshian said. The fund model will remain crypto-focused early on, but could take on other verticals later, he indicated.  Rather than take out fees over the life of the fund, the Apex team will allocate 15 percent of the total pool of tokens as its management fee.  Bradley said, ""What we're really trying to do is lock that percentage in upfront and push as much value back to the token holders as we can.""

At least that's according to commentators on China Central Television (CCTV), who, in a segment that aired on its Financial Channel this week, discussed the volatility of bitcoin and its recent rally above $10,000.  Citing a notable growth of China's OTC trading as one possible reason behind the surge, the program went on to raise concerns about the practice. As an illustration, a screen capture of Huobi Pro's website was shown to viewers that demonstrated the peer-to-peer trading and step-by-step guidance for new users.  Yet, in interpreting the statement from the People's Bank of China in September on banning initial coin offerings (ICOs), financial columnist and a TV personality Li Cangyu went so far as to state the the feature tries to bypass law enforcement and violates the specific rule whereby the PBoC prohibited any exchange from facilitating the trading between cryptocurrency and fiat currency.  Another commentator, Wan Zhe, a chief economic from China National Gold Group Corp., a central state-owned company that manages gold mining in the country, also echoed Li's opinion.  ""Not every peer-to-peer trading is necessarily illegal. But, providing a how-to guide and a middle-man platform to bridge the trade clearly violate the rules without any doubt,"" Wan added.  Huobi has yet to respond to requests for comments on the accusation.  The broadcast outlet, CCTV, is a state-owned channel and one of the official mouthpieces of the government and the China Communist Party. Although the program itself revealed no official statement from the government, it nonetheless delivers a notable message and gives insight into how the state media portrays the cryptocurrency among its national audience.  As reported previously, following China central bank's ban on ICO and suspension on crypto trading with the Chinese yuan, major exchanges in the country including Huobi and OKCoin have shifted the business focus overseas to their respective peer-to-peer trading platforms – Huobi Pro and OKEx.  Allowing mainland Chinese residents to buy and sell major cryptocurrencies using Chinese Yuan through bank wires, WeChat and Alipay, the two platforms are based out of Hong Kong, a special administrative region outside the mainland China's jurisdiction.  Elsewhere in the program, the usual arguments about bitcoin's high volatility and the benefits of the blockchain technology were also discussed, while the commentator Wan also made counterfactual claims by saying Amazon now accepts bitcoin as a payment method.

As per CoinDesk's price index, ether (ETH) moved above $500 at 12:35 UTC and hit an all-time high of $522 soon after. Data from CoinMarketCap shows ETH has appreciated 8.74 percent in the last 24 hours.  Stepping back a bit, this is a sharp reversal from mid-September when prices had fallen almost 50 percent to near $200 levels. However, they soon regained the bid tone – supposedly on the back of the sharp rally in bitcoin prices. The big breakout above $320 happened earlier this month, and as of now, ETH is up a staggering 7,000 percent on a year-to-date basis.  So, will the rally continue? The price action analysis suggests ether bulls could have a breather around $500 levels in the short-term.  The above chart shows:  Ether is overbought as per the relative strength index (RSI).

42400731,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKTYU,1511967611,Wallet Demo Showcases Lightning-Like Network for Ethereum,"Two technologies designed for bitcoin and ethereum appear to be converging.  A new video demo released this week, presented by Imperial College London assistant professor Arthur Gervais, shows how ethereum wallets might function with a mechanism like Lightning Network – a payments protocol originally designed to enhance bitcoin.  It's a notable step, as off-chain payments networks have long been touted as scaling solutions for blockchains such as bitcoin and ethereum. And although the wallets are not yet ready for use, the demo, from Gervais' new project, called Liquidity Network, signals that more people in the ethereum community are interested in adopting the technology.  To users, the wallet functions similarly to other ethereum wallets, in that it allows users to send and receive ether. But under the hood, the wallet is more complex, allowing users to connect to so-called ""hubs"" if they can't connect directly.  In the demo, Gervais shows one user depositing 100 wei (a tiny division of ether) into a hub.  Since the connection can then be used to send payments to any other user connected to the same hub, Gervais instantly sends 50 wei payments to one user and 30 wei to another.  [embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM9VWRBbqtU&feature=youtu.be[/embed]  Liquidity Network is working on a relatively new off-chain network for ethereum, that could possibly provide an alternative to the well-known in-development network, Raiden.  However, Liquidity uses slightly different technology modeled after the Revive payment channel – a model first put forth by the Liquidity Network founders in a white paper in September.

15989477,http://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/developers-discuss-state-bitcoin-privacy-baltic-honeybadger-conference,1511966728,Developers Discuss the State of Bitcoin Privacy at Baltic Honeybadger Conference,"A major highlight of the recent Baltic Honeybadger 2017 conference in Riga, Latvia was the final panel at the end of the second day of events, which consisted of a number of well-known developers in the Bitcoin ecosystem. During the panel discussion, the developers shared their thoughts on the current state of privacy in Bitcoin. Various participants on the panel pointed out the close relationship between privacy and scalability, the privacy issues with light wallets, and how the ecosystem is now on the cusp of a number of different privacy enhancements. Bitcoin Privacy Improves as the Technology Scales by Default The first panelist to comment on the topic of privacy in Bitcoin was applied cryptography consultant and sometimes Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd. For Todd, the main point he wanted to get across was that improved privacy is something that is inherently associated with better scalability of the system. “The whole reason why Bitcoin has such terrible privacy is everyone has everyone else’s transactions, and any scalability measure that makes Bitcoin scale better inevitably is going to make fewer people have fewer people’s data,” said Todd. Todd noted that people who use centralized off-chain services like Coinbase may have better privacy than those who are transacting on the public blockchain, depending on their threat model. For example, Coinbase knows everything that Coinbase users are doing, but North Korea knows nothing about these transactions because they’re processed on Coinbase’s internal servers. “As we go scale this tech up, if we do so successfully, we will get improved privacy no matter what we do,” added Todd, who pointed to the Lightning Network as a perfect example of this concept in practice. In terms of privacy-focused altcoins, such as Monero and Zcash, Todd claimed the scalability situation is actually worse. “Zcash and Monero both essentially have accumulators that mean that nodes need more data to go and process transactions,” explained Todd. “There are tradeoffs around this . . . but a lot of this tech isn’t there yet and it just makes things more complex.” Better Privacy Needs to Be Balanced with Usability When SatoshiLabs CTO Pavol Rusnak commented on Bitcoin privacy, he brought up the issue of usability in terms of future privacy improvements. In his view, there is a triangle of tradeoffs between privacy, security, and usability that must be understood. As a specific example, Rusnak pointed to MimbleWimble, which is a proposal for a much more private and scalable blockchain. Rusnak noted that while the proposal may improve the privacy situation, it also degrades usability by removing the ability to view one’s transaction history on the blockchain. “The question is: If there is a coin that has security and privacy but it loses usability because of its transaction history, will people be interested in using it?” asked Rusnak. “I think yes. But it’s still — we have a lot of people who are Trezor users and they really tend to look into their transaction history. They put labels everywhere.” Rusnak went on to add that there is no “silver bullet” that can be applied to every use case out there. The Privacy Problem for SPV Wallets As the microphone was handed over to Libbitcoin lead maintainer Eric Voskuil, he brought up the issue of wallets based on simplified payment verification (SPV). “I’d like to get client-server scenarios out of the P2P protocol,” said Voskuil. “I think it’s creeping in a bad direction.” In Voskuil’s view, shortcuts have been taken in order to implement more user-friendly bitcoin wallets. Some of these shortcuts have created new problems, and Voskuil specifically pointed to the issue of bloom filters, which are used in SPV wallets. “You can think of it as a DoS attack against nodes, it gives up privacy, there’s just nothing good about it,” said Voskuil. As Voskuil explained, those who use these bloom filters are giving some anonymous node on the network — which may actually be a node operated by a blockchain analytics company — an IP address to attach to a transaction. In Voskuil’s view, it would be better to simply connect to a server via the Tor network and publish a transaction there. That way, no one would know where it came from. Ciphrex CEO and Bitcoin Core contributor Eric Lombrozo agreed with Voskuil’s comments on bloom filters, and he indicated that the sync time associated with operating a full node is what pushes users to these less-secure, less-private wallets in the first place. “Right now, verification is not that cheap, and that’s a problem because then you basically end up outsourcing this to third parties, and that changes the entire security model of Bitcoin,” said Lombrozo. Lombrozo went on to refer to bloom filters as “a hack” that was never really fleshed out or well designed at all. “You don’t have to download entire blocks, but you do give up tremendous amounts of privacy,” Lombrozo added. In the past, Chaincode Labs’s Matt Corallo, who was a co-author of the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) related to bloom filters, has said he regrets ever writing up the idea. Lombrozo also pointed to Lightning Network developers Olaoluwa Osuntokun and Alex Akselrod’s proposal for client-side filtering in light clients, which would improve the privacy issues related to the use of SPV. “It gives you better privacy,” explained Lombrozo. “You can actually download a filter associated with a block and on your node you can actually check whether that block might contain transactions you’re interested in before you download the entire block.” Lombrozo also brought up BIP 151, which was authored by Bitcoin Core contributor Jonas Schnelli. The point of this proposal is to encrypt the data being sent over the P2P protocol, which could offer an obvious privacy improvement for light clients in terms of making their network communications less public. Blockstream CEO Adam Back also agreed with the idea that bloom filters are not very good for user privacy. However, Back also clarified that most of the light wallets available today, even the ones on smartphones, are not pure SPV wallets. Instead, the user usually connects to a server provided by the wallet developer or points the wallet at the user’s own full node running at home (or some combination of the two). For this reason, Back wondered whether there is much of a need for SPV wallets in Bitcoin. “If you already have two crosschecks — a semi-trusted node and an option of your own node — then do we really need the SPV protocol?” asked Back. “Because you’re allowing yourself to be surrounded by people who are trying to spy on your privacy — the people doing the kind of Chainanalysis kinds of things are running lots of crawlers on the network and being SPV providers to many wallets.” On the Cusp of Improvements in Bitcoin Privacy The most privacy-focused individual on the panel may have been JoinMarket developer Adam Gibson. JoinMarket is the most widely-used implementation of CoinJoin, which is a way for users to mix their bitcoins with each other and obscure their transaction history. Gibson continued Todd’s point on the relationship between privacy and scalability by specifically talking about Blockstream Mathematician Andrew Poelstra’s concept of scriptless scripts. “The way I’d put it is it’s like taking the semantics of the transaction off chain, so you may still have a transaction but the meaning of it is obscured [and] it becomes a lot more private,” explained Gibson. “For example, you might do a coin swap where you and I swap the history of our coins, but we do it in such a way that it just looks like a totally ordinary transaction. In fact, it’s impossible to distinguish from an ordinary transaction.” According to Gibson, there are many other examples of ways in which data can be taken off of the base Bitcoin blockchain layer to improve privacy. Like Todd, Gibson pointed to the Lightning Network as another obvious example. Gibson also pointed out that he’s now more excited by the concept of Confidential Transactions due to a recent paper that describes a way to massively improve the efficiency of these types of transactions, which are meant to mask the amounts associated with transactions. The JoinMarket developer went on to describe a world where Confidential Transactions are combined with CoinJoin to mask the most important attributes of Bitcoin transactions. In fact, Gibson indicated that this sort of combination can be done in a manner that makes privacy-conscious transactions cheaper than traditional Bitcoin transactions. Gibson also pointed to Schnorr signatures and MAST as two other upcoming improvements that could have implications for user privacy, but he also indicated that there is not much users can do to improve their own privacy today — outside of using JoinMarket or practicing good Bitcoin privacy hygiene such as avoiding address reuse. This is all in addition to the previous privacy improvements for light clients described by Lombrozo. “There’s a lot of very close things at this point, which makes me a bit more positive than I might have been before,” concluded Gibson.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | XMR | ZEC,,0,0,Crypto Daily,http://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/developers-discuss-state-bitcoin-privacy-baltic-honeybadger-conference,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/15989477.jpeg

42400733,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKTaS,1511960418,"Bitcoin Cash Plans to Increase Its Block Size, Again","Bitcoin cash developers have made ""tentative"" plans to increase the cryptocurrency's block size again next year.  At least, that's according to a new, rough six to 12-month roadmaphttps://www.bitcoinabc.org/bitcoin-abc-medium-term-development released yesterday by the bitcoin offshoot's main developer team, Bitcoin ABC. The roadmap notably includes two hard forks – an upgrading method that requires everyone running the software to upgrade – scheduled for May and November of 2018.  Bitcoin cash is a cryptocurrency that emerged earlier this summer out of bitcoin's block size debate.  Effectively blocked by those in the developer community who were reluctant to move too quickly towards a block size increase (arguing it could harm bitcoin's security), a number of bigger block advocates went their own way and created their own cryptocurrency. Most significantly, bitcoin cash boasts a block size parameter limit eight times larger than that of bitcoin.  Bitcoin cash development didn't stop at this initial split, however. Its developers have announced other plans to improve the cryptocurrency, which are added to by the new roadmap.  The announcement goes on to explain:  ""We want to make it more reliable, more scalable, with low fees and ready for rapid growth. It should 'just work', without complications or hassles. It should be ready for global adoption by mainstream users, and provide a solid foundation that businesses can rely on.""  Bitcoin cash supporters believe increasing the block size is key to accomplishing this, since fees will theoretically rise less quickly as the block size increases.  Later on in the roadmap, the Bitcoin ABC developers lay out other possible features, such as reviving older rules that had been deactivated in the code.  The roadmap is subject to change as the community chimes in, however. Bitcoin ABC is only one of several bitcoin cash software implementations that need to agree and move forward with the change. (Although at least one other implementation, nChain, has given the proposal its blessing.)  The group doesn't plan to release a formal announcement until February 2018.

42400744,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKTnF,1511958643,"Bitcoin Price on Shaky Ground After 1,000% Gains","Bitcoin may be starting to show signs of bull market exhaustion.  As per CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), bitcoin (BTC) rose to a new all-time high of $10,831.75 at 05:35 UTC, having first moved above $10,000 in Asian trading hours. As of writing, BTC is at $10,900. The meteoric rise has taken year-to-date gains to 1,000 percent.  Still, there is a need to be cautious, the latest price and volume activity suggests.  The above chart shows:  A high volume price drop to near $10,000 as represented by the big bearish engulfing.  Volumes fell as the price recovered to $10,800 from the engulfing candle low.  A bearish engulfing candle is characterized by a bearish candle, whose body – the open and close –swallows up the previous candle's body. On the chart above, the big red candle has enveloped the body of the previous two 1-hour candles.  Also, as noted above the volume spiked as prices fell back to $10,000, before falling sharply as prices recovered. As such, the move suggests that weak hands are at play, i.e. the latest move higher from $10,000 to above $10,800 lacks substance.  Further, the relative strength index (RSI) shows overbought conditions on the 1-hour chart and 4-hour chart. Meanwhile, the daily RSI is at the highest level since May further hinting that bitcoin is extremely overbought.  View  A pullback to $9946 (1-hour 50-MA) looks likely, and a violation there would expose support at $9,600 and $9,400.  Investors also need to watch out for potential bearish RSI divergence. For example, prices could clock fresh highs above $11,000 in early U.S. hours before falling back below $10,500 on overbought conditions. In such a case, the 1-hour RSI would form lower highs.  Confirmation of bearish price RSI divergence would validate bearish daily view put forward by price and volume study and could only increase the magnitude of the pullback.  On a larger scheme of things, only a break below $9,000 (rising trend line support on the daily chart) would signal a bullish-to-bearish trend change.  On the higher side, only a high volume jump above $11,000 would be considered a good news, although overbought conditions as showed by the RSI could come into play anytime.

According to TASS, the central bank's annual Financial Stability Report noted an apparent bubble in the cryptocurrency markets, stating that it may lead to ""substantial losses"" for investors.  The report also stated that cryptocurrencies may be used for criminal activities, in particular for money laundering and terrorism financing.  The report continued on to declare that:  ""The task of national and supranational regulators is to minimize those risks via developing a coordinated approach to regulation of the cryptocurrencies market and restricting the potential of high-risk investments and transactions.""  This is not the first time the central bank has come out against cryptocurrencies. Deputy governor Sergei Shvetsov said just last month that the bank would try to block non-Russian websites from selling bitcoin in the country altogether.  At the time, he said bitcoin came with ""unreasonably high risks,"" echoing the sentiments expressed in this month's report. He also referred to bitcoin as a pyramid scheme due to its generation of high returns in short periods of time.  Those comments came as part of Russia's apparent efforts to restrict to bitcoin exchanges in the country. In September, deputy finance minister Alexey Moiseev said he expected all cryptocurrency payments to be banned by the national government.

42400738,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKThL,1511946006,ICO Mania Has Calmed Down a Bit – And That's Not So Bad,"What do printed manifestos, football leagues and bathroom marketing have in common?  All three showcased that interest in initial coin offerings (ICOs) was alive and well at CoinDesk's Consensus: Invest conference on Tuesday. But while attendees on the floor may have seen all the usual evidence of a frothy market, attitudes from investors and entrepreneurs surveyed appeared more dour.  For example, while investors expressed no doubt about the promise of decentralization, they did voice broad skepticism about the majority of new coins on offer.  ""I definitely feel like the mood around the ICOs has come down from being ultra, ultra hot,"" Chase Lochmiller of Polychain Capital told CoinDesk.  Backed by Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures, Lochmiller said Polychain now has $400 million invested exclusively into the crypto market.  Yet, one of the big themes from Consensus: Invest was the increasing sophistication of the larger crypto market, as it has added capacity in derivatives, exchanges and custody infrastructure. In contrast, most of the best tools are only available to traders in larger cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether.  In other words, while retail investors may want into the ICO market, financial service providers haven't been in a rush. That said, the ICO market is catching up to the dominant coins, as new cryptocurrency hedge funds begin allocating capital.  ""I think having more investors in the space is helpful,"" Lochmiller said, adding that it increases competition and the pressure on projects to produce, as well as giving the market legitimacy.  Lochmiller expects a lot of the financial instruments being built for bitcoin and ethereum now to eventually filter down to smaller tokens, and he sees opportunity in facilitating shorts.  ""I think a very interesting space to tackle is the token lending market,"" he said.  If someone wants a short, they need a way to find someone willing to lend the tokens they want to bet against. That scenario doesn't exist yet. Still, it fits into a larger theme that came up throughout the day: how to bring more liquidity into smaller tokens.  ""You have got to get trading volume,"" Ian McAfee of Shift Forex said during his presentation.  One area of promise he sees is building exchanges with non-English user interfaces and in markets not denominated in the dollar or the euro.  Chicken and egg  But such an exchange will only get built if there's demand for trades.  ""It's hard to know how much demand there is and how much noise,"" a spokesperson for ShapeShift told CoinDesk. That's why trading volume is one of the main data points the exchange, which facilitates trading solely between cryptocurrencies, looks at before adding a new asset.  ""There's certainly a lot on our radar we'd like to add,"" the spokesperson added.  But adding a new token is not a negligible investment in terms of developer hours, and even as they do so, it's still the big trading pairs that dominate, such as bitcoin to bitcoin cash.  For tokens built around solving a specific problem, trading volume is likely to stay light until their products are ready to go into operation, and then there's the problem of whether or not the underlying protocols can actually handle demand.  ""There's not one of these blockchains that are even close to nearly fast enough to let any of these companies successfully run their businesses on,"" Michael Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Investment Partners said from the main stage.  'Rubbish' tokens  Moving higher up the investor food chain to institutional investors, it's hard to picture any of them taking new ICOs seriously until a more robust custodial ecosystem is in place.  But ""after ether, there's nothing for any of these other assets out there,"" Daniel Matuszewski, Circle's head of trading, said during one of the event's main stage panels.  And the market for tokens probably isn't ready for those kinds of investors yet anyway.  In equities markets, it's not unusual to invest in index funds that buy up huge swathes of the stock market, but cryptocurrencies aren't ready for that kind of investing.  Crypto trader Willy Woo showed a graph of a thousand coins on one chart, explaining that if someone had bought all of them, they wouldn't have made any money.  ""There's a lot of rubbish on the market,"" Woo said.  ""You really need to compare these to just investing into bitcoin over time,"" Tetras Capital's Alex Sunnarborg cautioned.  Bubble trouble?  Elsewhere, there was a sense that the market is seeking to reign in some of its excesses, or at least becoming more aware of their presence.  Linda Xie of Scalar Capital, for example, made something of an indictment of entrepreneurs rushing into the market with half-baked plans and no hard cap on the amount they want to raise.  ""I'm concerned that there's a project that will raise a hundred million dollars and they'll get lazy and won't do the work and they'll run away with the money … I'm worried this will happen, people will realize it's a bubble, and the thing will collapse,"" she said.  But that doesn't mean everyone viewed the froth as inherently bad in the long run.  ""There's certainly some bubblicious aspects to all this,"" Mat Cybula, CEO of Cryptiv, said in breakout presentation, but ""bubbles aren't always the worst thing"" he added.  Novogratz concurred, concluding:  ""Bubbles happen around ideas that actually are right and change the world.""

Or so claims new researchhttps://www.htbridge.com/news/security-cryptocurrency-mobile-apps.html from San Francisco security firm High-Tech Bridge based on an analysis of more than 2,000 apps on Google Play. Of the first 30 crypto apps with up to 100,000 total installations, 93 percent contain at least three ""medium-risk"" vulnerabilities and 90 percent contain at least two ""high-risk"" issues.  Among the most-downloaded apps, the numbers are a little better, but not by much. Ninety-four percent of apps with over 500,000 installations contain at least three ""medium-risk"" vulnerabilities and 77 percent contain at least two high-risk vulnerabilities.  The most common vulnerabilities, according to the analysis, include ""insecure data storage,"" which means information that should be private can leak unintentionally, and ""insufficient cryptography,"" which indicates some form of cryptography was implemented to shield data, but was used incorrectly.  In short, this means users might be at risk.  ""Depending on the application functionality, design and vulnerabilities, a wide spectrum of nuisances is possible, up to sensitive data and even the wallet (private key) theft,"" said Ilia Kolochenko, CEO and founder of High-Tech Bridge.  He added:  ""Unfortunately, I am not surprised with the outcomes of the research.""  Kolochenko attributes the poor scores to a lack of emphasis on security across mobile development.  ""For many years, cybersecurity companies and independent experts were notifying mobile app developers about the risks of 'agile' development that usually imply no framework to assure secure design, secure coding and hardening techniques or application security testing,"" he added.  Users and developers can use the company's free security analysis tool, Mobile X-Rayhttps://www.htbridge.com/mobile/, to plug in mobile apps and see the vulnerabilities for themselves.  However, when it comes to securing funds, there's plenty that can go wrong. The tech firm implies that its own research doesn't go far enough.

42400712,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcKRz5,1511927105,Credit for Cryptos: Leverage Trading Is Coming to Bitcoin,"""Leverage is the touchstone of most of the bubbles in the world.""  A few years ago, that comment by Murray Stahl, chairman and CEO of asset manager Horizon Kinetics, would have been so typical for a cryptocurrency conference as to escape notice. But at CoinDesk's Consensus: Invest event on Tuesday in New York, Stahl's credit-wary sentiment stood out as an outlier.  Instead, ""leverage,"" ""lending,"" ""margin trading"" and ""credit"" were painted as elements of the market that need to be further developed (along with better custody services) in order for the nascent crypto asset industry to flourish – not sins of the legacy financial system to avoid repeating.  Call it a sign of selling out, an early warning of systemic risk or simply an indicator that the cryptocurrency world is maturing. Either way, the arrival of institutional and high-net-worth investors in the space has created openings for services similar to the prime brokerage that financial institutions have long provided to hedge funds, several speakers said.  ""There is a strong demand for leverage in the space,"" said Adam White, a vice president at Coinbase and general manager of GDAX, its digital asset trading platform.  To meet that demand, GDAX hopes to reintroduce a margin service that it put on ""pause"" earlier this year, White said during a morning panel discussion. (He didn't say why the service was suspended, but it apparently happened sometime after the ether ""flash crash"" this summer.)  Trade-offs  But the desire of traders to amplify returns with leverage is not the only reason some see a need for more lending in this market.  Rather, some provision of credit on an intraday basis and post-trade settlement is inescapable even when assets are settled on a blockchain, said Max Boonen, CEO of B2C2, an electronic market making firm based in London.  During his morning presentation, Boonen challenged one of the long-touted selling points of blockchains: the instant settlement of trades.  He told the 1,300-strong crowd:  ""Could settlement become faster? Yes. Could settlement become instant? Absolutely not, and nor should it be.""  For one thing, the block size debate in bitcoin has underscored that there is a ""trade-off between the speed of settlement and the resilience of the payments infrastructure,"" he said. ""The more transactions you push through the network, the more brittle it can become.""  Moreover, gross settlement – a pre-blockchain term for trades that are settled as soon as they are processed – ""imposes a lot of pressure on the balance sheets of market participants,"" said Boonen.  For example, he told the audience, ""if I buy $1 million of Treasuries in the morning, and I sell my Treasuries in the afternoon, I need to maintain at all times that $1 million on my balance sheet.""  On the other hand, net settlement (the type of system that real-time gross settlement and later blockchains were supposed to replace) allows for a more efficient use of balance sheets – but requires intraday credit, he said.  Credit creeps in  Echoing these speakers, Dan Matuszewski, the head of trading at Circle Internet Financial, said during a morning panel that there is a ""real strong need"" for the ability to borrow in this market.  It would not only facilitate short positions but also provide working capital for trading desks to make markets, he said.  During his talk, Boonen of B2C2 acknowledged the irony of the situation given that bitcoin was born as a reaction to the 2008 credit crisis.  ""Bitcoin enthusiasts really, really do not like credit,"" he said. But, he added, ""for better or for worse, credit is an important part of a functioning and liquid financial market.”  Even before the institutional money started flowing in, he noted, ""by necessity, credit did creep back into bitcoin and crypto markets in general,"" with the major exchanges offering leverage to the early retail investors.  The ""beauty"" of cryptocurrency is that trusted third parties are not required to simply transfer funds between wallets, Boonen said. But for now, he added, they are needed for the more complex business of trading crypto assets, ""to a much greater extent than in the mainstream financial markets.""

However, at press time, domestic exchanges including Coinbase's GDAX exchange, Paxos's itBit exchange and Gemini, were all posting spot prices above the $10,000 mark.  With the move, bitcoin is now up more than 900 percent on a year-to-date basis, with prices climbing 230 percent since a low of $3,000 in mid-September.  The meteoric rise has pushed the combined market value for all cryptocurrencies to a new high. Bitcoin's market capitalization is now close to $170 billion, additional market data shows.  At press time, the price of bitcoin is trading at 10,038.
