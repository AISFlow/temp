42387549,18tZcBceb7lzdS5vgOGC2o,1641678355,"Bitcoin Falls Toward $40K, Racks Up Longest Losing Streak Since 2018","Bitcoin fell for a seventh-straight day, the longest losing streak since 2018, slipping toward the key psychological threshold of $40,000.  As of press time bitcoin (BTC) was changing hands around $40,800, down 2.3% over the past 24 hours, based on CoinDesk pricing. Bitcoin’s stretch of losses is now the longest since the downdraft from July 30 through Aug. 4 in 2018.  The price hasn’t fallen below $40,000 since September 2021, and it’s well off the all-time high near $69,000 reached in November.  Launched in 2009, bitcoin celebrated its 13-year birthday last week, but there hasn’t been much of a party.  Crypto market analysts had warned recently that bitcoin might be prone to a steeper sell-off, though there were some signs late last week that the market might be stabilizing. January tends to be a seasonally weak month for bitcoin, but this year has been especially harsh, with the largest cryptocurrency down 11% so far in 2022.  The market was roiled last week by the release of Federal Reserve minutes signaling that officials at the U.S. central bank were starting to discuss whether to take more aggressive steps to tackle an inflation rate now at its highest in almost four decades.  Many investors say bitcoin has benefited in recent years from the Fed’s ultra-loose, emergency monetary policy since the coronavirus hit the economy – including printing more than $4 trillion to bolster ailing traditional markets.  So a reversal of those policies is seen as a fresh headwind for bitcoin.  There’s also a narrative in the market that bitcoin trades like a risky asset, similar to tech stocks. And the Fed’s hawkish turn could curb appetite for high-risk, high-reward investments.  “Macroeconomic uncertainty has led to relatively low conviction from market players,” analysts at Coinbase Institutional, an arm of the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, wrote Friday in a weekly update.  The question now is when and where the bitcoin price will find a floor.  As of Friday the price was down 35% from the all-time high; previous drawdowns have reached levels of nearly 80% and it took the market months to recover.  Some bulls are still betting that the market is on the cusp of a fresh bull run, but analysts for the investment-research firm FundStrat say the market looks to have little near-term price support until it drops down to $39,570 – roughly where the price bottomed in September 2021.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/08/bitcoin-falls-toward-40k-racks-up-longest-losing-streak-since-2018,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f60cca53e2e2e566ec077fb13f567ae9d00671d2-1441x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411572,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOsoL,1641668977,The Metaverse Needs a Constitution,"The U.S. Constitution is the foundation of America, ensuring rights and responsibilities for every American. Today, another new world is being created as we speak: the metaverse. Without some of the same guiding principles, we fear the metaverse will fail as a public, open system and only recreate social media’s glaring flaws with steroids.  Before we knew it was capable of doing so, Facebook was shaping elections and Twitter was embroiled in scandals around its impact on public safety and censorship. Without due care, the metaverse could transform into a far more terrifying monster.  Rich Geldreich and Stephanie Hurlburt are tech entrepreneurs and co-founders of Binomial, an image and texture compression company.  We mustn’t become exploited by the metaverse. Rather, it should serve us. For that to happen, it needs a constitution.  First, its core building blocks must be made of open standards and open source code. Second, all data policies must be both transparent and understandable. Finally, any research conducted in the metaverse must be made instantly available to the public.  We must establish exactly what the metaverse is, and isn’t. Merriam-Webster describes the metaverse as “a highly immersive virtual world where people gather to socialize, play and work.” Many may feel that Merriam Webster’s definition of the metaverse accurately describes all of our lives over lockdown; the only place to engage with others is online. A rudimentary metaverse is already here, just now it has a name.  Read more: Kelsie Nabben - ‘Crypto-States’ Will Compete With Corporates in the Metaverse  It’s also important to establish that the metaverse is not owned by one company and certainly wasn’t invented by Facebook. Rather, the company’s rebrand as Meta is a bid to co-opt, and therefore dominate the metaverse.  Facebook invested $10 billion in it this year alone. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates the market size for the metaverse could reach $800 billion by 2024. We might not know how it will turn out. All we know is that it is coming.  When social media first hit the scene, no one predicted it would be used to topple governments. Today, we are at that Pandora’s Box moment with the metaverse.  That’s why we are proposing a constitution for the metaverse. We believe it is critical to establish a simple set of rules that may help us prevent making the same mistakes we made in the past.  Read more: David Z. Morris - Facebook, Walmart and How Companies Shouldn’t Set Up in the Metaverse  Before we enter the modern metaverse, we first have to establish who can access its key building blocks, and the answer should be everyone. When Tim Berners-Lee created the internet, he released key pieces as open-source code that were free and accessible for everyone.  His vision was that the internet would become a common good, just like public lands in America; a place owned consecutively by everyone and no one. The metaverse and future of the web must operate on the same principle. At the least, we should keep anything that is owned publicly visible and open for all to see and change.  The second principle of the metaverse must be that data policies are both transparent and understandable. Companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google may point to their data waiver. However, as everyone knows, not even the most diligent human brain could read, much less understand that infamous script.  If left unchecked, personal data mining and extraction in the metaverse could amount to the single most powerful surveillance mechanism ever invented. Through the metaverse and their contingent headsets, companies could harvest unimaginable amounts of eerie, biometric data. Before we allow ourselves or our children to run headfirst into this digital world, we must first know who is watching, and how.  A constitution for the metaverse may sound high-minded, but there are practical ways it can be implemented. Governments can create laws and regulations around fair play in the metaverse. A company’s earnings must be made public by law and a company’s research in the metaverse could easily follow a similar rulebook.  As far back as 2016, an internal Facebook report found that 64% of those people who joined an extremist group on Facebook had been recommended that group via Facebook’s algorithm, even though these findings weren’t made public. There’s no reason this form of coverup shouldn’t be made criminal by law.  While ultimate power flows from the government, companies have their role to play. It is common for consortiums of individuals and companies that come together to agree to a set of baseline rules (usually a patent pool or agreement to openly share data with the group) and create new standards that the industry agrees to follow. It is only a matter of collective will.  Read more: Annie Zhang - Web 3 and the Metaverse Are Not the Same  Yet, even multinational companies have a boss: the public. Apple’s privacy push and Facebook’s rebrand show that no matter the size of the company, public opinion reigns supreme. If the public displays enough appetite for a metaverse constitution, Big Tech’s hands will be tied.  This is not new territory; Tim Berners-Lee has already called for a global “bill of rights” for the web. At this critical juncture for the web, we’d be wise to heed his call.  Emerging technologies have a way of solving old problems whilst creating new ones. Tim Berners-Lee said that “day-to-day life on the web is like day-to-day life on the street, (it will) have its rough edges and its smooth edges.” A constitution for the metaverse would round those smooth edges, while protecting ourselves against the rough.",NEUTRAL,없음,MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | RESEARCH,"Stephanie Hurlburt, Rich Geldreich",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/01/08/the-metaverse-needs-a-constitution,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a8e3fc19feb7339d98d45615cad37b45b871c4f-4240x2832.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387548,18tZcBceb7lzdS5vgOGC2C,1641652985,India’s Central Bank Creates Fintech Department That Will Address CBDC,"India’s central bank has created a department for fintech challenges, which include forming cryptocurrency regulations and creating a central bank digital currency (CBDC).  The move by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) comes two weeks after CoinDesk reported that “while the RBI is adequately staffed with specific departments to discharge these tasks, it still does not have a fintech department, just a division, leaving questions about efficiency and long-term commitment unanswered.”  The RBI is working on two types of CBDCs, wholesale and retail, and the new department will oversee their development. Meanwhile, India’s parliament is set to consider regulations of cryptocurrencies. The RBI has unsuccessfully tried to prohibit banks from dealing with crypto exchanges in the past.  The new department will be led by Ajay Kumar Choudhary, who was appointed by the RBI as executive director, saying he “will look after Fintech Department, Risk Monitoring Department and Inspection Department.”  “You can expect much more action from Mr. Ajay Kumar Choudhary towards the central bank digital currency. This may signify a shift from the RBI’s stance towards fast-tracking CBDC piloting,” said a source with knowledge of the matter.  The move is a long-in-coming recognition by the RBI to allocate resources to the fintech sector. Experts had complained that India’s institutions didn’t have an enough staff focused on fintech challenges such as the burgeoning crypto-sphere in India.  “It’s a positive signal of intent to build real regulatory capacity to oversee the fast-paced fintech industry,” said Vivan Sharan, a technology and policy expert who has worked with the government in the past.  “It is also a reflection of the central bank’s desire to deepen digital payments through a focus on innovation, and a recognition of the growing importance of various forms of digital money that will require supervisory bandwidth,” Sharan said.  In June 2018, the RBI had formed a fintech unit in the Department of Regulation to act as a central point of contact in the bank for all activities related to fintech.  According to an internal administrative circular viewed by CoinDesk, the upgrading of that unit into its own department is aimed at promoting innovation in the sector, identifying the challenges and opportunities associated with it and addressing them in a timely manner and providing a framework for further research on the subject that can aid policy.  “All matters related to the facilitation of constructive innovations and incubations in the fintech sector, which may have wider implications for the financial sector/markets and falling under the purview of the Bank, will be dealt with by the FinTech Department,” the document said.",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/08/indias-central-bank-creates-fintech-department-as-challenges-posed-by-crypto-cbdc-grow,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/12025b35bf1f5d816cefc6764419ffe21296ca89-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Short selling is a more complicated trading strategy than simply buying or selling anything because it requires precise timing and carries a lot more risk. We&apos;ll go through how to sell Bitcoin short, where you may do it, and what risks you should be aware of. Note: This post is solely for educational purposes. Short selling is extremely risky, and you could lose all of your money. Don&apos;t do it if you don&apos;t have enough knowledge, expertise, or cash to lose. Is it Possible to Short Bitcoin? Yes, an investor can short Bitcoin in a few different methods. In general, shorting involves borrowing a certain amount of bitcoins and selling them at their present value. Then, in the future, you&apos;d buy bitcoins to repay the debt—ideally, the price would have plummeted by then, and you&apos;d be repaying the loan with bitcoins that were less expensive than the ones you borrowed. Shorting Bitcoin has the advantage of allowing investors to profit in a down market. Shorting has the disadvantage of being more risky and complex than just buying or selling something.

And traditional Norton customers are livid about it. One of the most controversial parts of the story is the 15% cut that the company takes. This is a commercial program that you have to pay for, so it&apos;s only logical that people are not ok with it. Related Reading | Research: Crypto Mining Malware Still Abundant Despite Market Decline Of course, Norton&apos;s Ethereum mining program is nothing new. Seven months ago, when they were testing it, our sister site Bitcoinist reported on it and said: &apos;A select number of Norton 360 customers, who joined the early adopter program, received their invites to mine Ethereum today. The program is expected to expand to include all 13 million Norton customers in the coming months. In explaining the odd pairing, the firm said cryptocurrency mining is fraught with risk and often involves disabling security and allowing &apos;unvetted code&apos;. This leaves miners vulnerable to skimmed earnings and ransomware. Norton claims to address these issues by enabling users to safely and easily mine cryptocurrency through the user-friendly Norton 360 platform.&apos; Ok, so it&apos;s for your own good.

42423916,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2iNBh,1641646272,Industry Body for Indian Startups Seeks Crypto Rules,"IndiaTech.org, an industry body of startups that includes crypto exchanges, wants the country’s parliament to provide clear tax laws for cryptocurrencies during its upcoming budget session, according to a letter the group sent to the finance minister.  “It is critical for the Union Budget to clearly lay down taxation clarity around crypto assets by formally naming them in tax laws,” the letter stated. The lobbying group has been taking part in discussions with government officials and the Reserve Bank of India, the country’s central bank, about crypto tax policy.  India’s budget session is expected to start on Jan. 31, and the budget will likely be presented Feb. 1. The session will likely last until the end of April.  As first reported by the Economic Times, the letter was sent on the day CoinDesk released an in-depth report about how India’s crypto exchanges were recently “inspected” by tax agencies, which recovered more than Rs 84 crore ($11 million) during the “inspections.” Binance-owned WazirX, which was one the exchanges that were inspected, blamed a lack of regulatory clarity for the inspections. It’s that lack of clarity that IndiaTech.org wants to address.  “We have just submitted the letter yesterday and the intent is for the government to take the recommendations into consideration in the upcoming budget,” said IndiaTech President and CEO Rameesh Kailasam.  The group said that “there may not be the need for a bill around cryptocurrency if existing provisions are appropriately amended/notified accommodating crypto assets and regulated starting with the upcoming union budget.”  India’s draft cryptocurrency bill is still in the works and probably won’t become law until after the budget session ends, CoinDesk has reported.  Read more: India’s Crypto Law Might Not Be Ready Before May, Sources Say  The group’s recommendations include granting cryptocurrencies recognition as a digital asset, enabling provisions in the direct tax laws. Th group also said that an indirect tax (GST, or the goods and services tax) should be levied only on an exchange’s trading fee, not on a transaction’s value.  The letter also said that the country should register Indian-founded cryptocurrency exchanges, giving them the status of “authorized dealers,” and asked the government to set up a system of checks and balances, including allowing only Indian founders to operate such businesses (minimum ownership of 26% by Indian founders/entities in crypto exchanges).  “We have suggested a practical way forward, which is doable,” Kailasam said. “Our white paper released earlier was also in the same direction to address concerns and move towards a practical regulatory process.”",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/08/industry-body-for-indian-startups-seeks-crypto-rules-in-coming-budget-session-of-parliament,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

In a note published Wednesday, Managing Director, Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou noted that Ethereum currently accounts for nearly 65 percent of DeFi&apos;s market share. At the beginning of 2021, the network&apos;s DeFi share was almost 100 percent. Panigirtzoglou explained that Ethereum will reclaim its position as a DeFi leader only when the final phase of sharding which is crucial for scaling the ETH network gets completed in 2023. Until then, the network will continue losing its market share to alternative blockchains like Terra, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, and Solana, also known as &apos;ethereum-killers.&apos; By the time sharding gets implemented, these alternative blockchain platforms would have grown by so much that Ethereum could lose its DeFi dominance permanently. Such &apos;ethereum-killers&apos; have already been receiving large amounts of funding, public attention, and creating a community behind them. In fact, just last month, Bank of America said that Avalanche is a viable platform to Ethereum for DeFi, NFTs, gaming and other projects. &apos;In our mind, this optimistic view about ethereum&apos;s dominance is at risk.

Christensen expressed his dissatisfaction with the UST and MIM&apos;reply men&apos; on Twitter, and expressed his thoughts on the two relatively new stablecoins, comparing them to DAI. Christensen stated: &apos;Look, UST and MIM are solid ponzis and I respect that. You can make good money off them for sure. But they are not built for resilience and they are going to 0 once the market turns for real.&apos; DAI, according to Christensen, was developed for resilience, and the project is the most trustworthy when it comes to smart contracts and collateral security. In December, however, UST flipped DAI as the most valuable stablecoin project. Despite this, DAI is the second most valuable decentralized stablecoin project in terms of market valuation. Engineered Inversely While MIM, UST, and DAI are all decentralized stablecoins, they are all built-in distinct ways. UST is a pure algorithmic stablecoin whose peg is maintained through arbitrage incentives, unlike DAI and MIM, which are collateralized stablecoins with other assets guaranteeing their value in the event of a selloff. The fact that part of the cash supporting the assets is made up of centralized stablecoins has led to criticism of these collateralized stablecoins.
