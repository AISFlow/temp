42377098,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6y5gt,1396389455,Central Bank of Colombia Says 'Bitcoin is Not a Currency',"On Tuesday, 1st April, Banco Central de Colombia, the central bank of the South American nation, issued new statements regarding bitcoin, confirming that the digital currency is not considered a currency or a means of legal tender in the country.  The news comes roughly one week after the Superintendencia Financiera de Colombia (SFC), the government body with jurisdiction over the Colombian financial system, issued a ruling that domestic banks would be barred from holding, investing in or brokering bitcoin transactions.  Said the central bank, according to reports:  ""The bitcoin is not a currency in Colombia and, therefore, not a means of payment of unlimited legal tender with a discharge power. Then there is no obligation to receive it as a means of fulfilling the obligations.""  The central bank also reiterated the SFC's 26th March finding that bitcoin does not meet the definition of a currency because it is not backed by a central bank.  Bitcoin discussions continue  Colombia has been increasingly active on matters relating to digital currencies in recent weeks, following the 20th March rumours that the SFC would move to ban bitcoin transactions altogether.  This report later turned out to be exaggerated, as Colombia issued guidance similar to that originally posed by China and Mexico, barring its banks from interacting with the sector.  Speaking to CoinDesk, members of the local Colombian digital currency community were optimistic at the time that this represented a first step in relations between regulators and local enthusiasts.  Community reaction  Roman Parra, CEO and founder of Colombia-based bitcoin buying and selling service Bitcoin Suramérica, confirmed the statements were a continuation of past guidance. However, Parra found them particularly troubling given that they represent what he considers a lack of interest from the government in developing or building the local bitcoin ecosystem.  Still, he notes, the question of whether bitcoin is money in Colombia does have an impact on local business.  According to Parra, as in much of the world, it's still unclear how bitcoin transactions completed in Colombia should be treated for tax purposes.  Explained Parra:  ""We are trying to find out the best way to handle this legal topic. At the present time we are acting like a commerce company.""  Bitcoin in South America  Research from BitLegal suggests that only a few South American governments have spoken out about bitcoin and digital currencies. Its records show Colombia. Brazil and Argentina have all issued guidance to their local communities.  Further research from the US Law Library of Congress indicates Chile has also issued formal statements.  However, even countries that haven't addressed digital currencies, such as Venezuela, have seen a recent rise in bitcoin enthusiasm, suggesting more countries in the region may need to follow suit.

42377092,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6y5ab,1396387412,Bitcoin User Files White House Petition to Amend Latest IRS Notice,"A petition to amend Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Notice 2014-2 – the new guidance released on 25th March that announced digital currencies would be treated as property for tax purposes – has been filed on WhiteHouse.gov.  Managed by the presiding presidential administration, the official website of the White House allows for the filing of public petitions on all manner of subjects, from whether Election Day should be a designated holiday, to whether Alaska should secede from the US and join Russia.  Petitions that cross a certain threshold of signatures then generally garner a White House response.  Filed on 28th March, the new petition argues that the IRS's recent ruling on digital currencies is ""overly burdensome,"" and that by imposing capital gains on all transactions, the policy will hurt innovation in the sector. The positioning is not unlike the one voiced by major industry investors when defending against the prospect of new regulation earlier this year.  Reads the petition:  ""This treatment of VC is overly burdensome as it will create onerous record-keeping issues and unnecessary costs that will stifle the development and advancement of this important technology.""  To date, the IRS ruling has garnered varying responses. Bitcoin Foundation director Jon Matonis has said that the classification affirms bitcoin's status as digital gold, though others allege that the IRS notice will adversely affect many aspects of bitcoin ownership and use.  More details  Perhaps the biggest impact the ruling will have is on bitcoin's role in payments, as each transaction will require capital gains reporting.  While even bitcoin's detractors view its underlying technology as perhaps its biggest advantage, the guidance seems to discourage its use as a payment system, a fact that the petition acknowledges.  Reads the petition:  ""Under this interpretation, when Bitcoin is spent, the owner will have the tenuous responsibility of calculating their capital gains or losses, as well as the Seller of the goods or services.""  Community response  The petition gained significant attention on reddit this weekend, garnering nearly 200 comments from bitcoin users who greeted the initiative with varying amounts of enthusiasm. Many voiced uncertainty that the petition would be ultimately effective, while others took issue with what they considered the poor wording and limited argument of the petition itself. The petition was still circulating on social media as of 1st April.  Still, other commentators, such as SecondMarket and Bitcoin Investment Trust CEO Barry Silbert, suggest this ruling was the best possible outcome for the bitcoin community.  Speaking to CoinDesk, he acknowledged that the ruling represents a short-term burden for the industry, but he says innovation will help bitcoin users abide by the new rules:  ""It clearly creates a new record-keeping requirement which in the near term is going to be overly burdensome, but I'm highly confident that by tax time a year from now, there will be plenty of automated solutions that will eliminate any headaches of managing this process.""  To date, the petition has received only 403 signatures. Its goal is to obtain 100,000 signatures by 27th April.  IRS asks for comment  Although the filing is a noteworthy sign of community concern, it is unclear how useful it will be given that the US Treasury Department and the IRS have asked the public for comments on the measure. However, the petition could theoretically come to the attention of the IRS should it reach a sizeable amount signatures.  The IRS would not comment on whether such a petition would or would not impact its decision, but stated that it considers information from a variety of sources when soliciting feedback for notices that have yet to become final rules.  Bitcoin users who are interested in providing feedback to the IRS may be better served by sending feedback via standard mail or by email to the government tax body. All entries will be posted for public inspection in their entirety.

42377096,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6y5eN,1396384503,Ross Ulbricht's Attorney Cites IRS Guidance in Motion to Dismiss Charges,"An attorney representing alleged Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht has asked that a federal judge dismiss four charges against his client as part of his ongoing New York indictment.  In a 64-page filing submitted to the District Court of the Southern District of New York this weekend, Ulbricht's defence attorney, Joshua Dratel, argues that one count of money laundering, running a criminal enterprise, narcotics conspiracy and conspiracy to commit computer hacking be dismissed, stating that they are vague and do not cover his client's alleged conduct.  Perhaps most interestingly, Dratel took issue with the money laundering charge, adopting the position that bitcoin does not qualify as a money instrument under the law, due in part to the wording used in formal FinCEN and IRS guidance on the issue.  Read the filing:  ""Count Four, which alleges money laundering, is defective because it fails to allege sufficiently an essential element of the offense – that Mr. Ulbricht engaged in, or conspired to engage in, “financial transactions” - as Bitcoin, the alleged “payment system that served to facilitate the illegal commerce conducted on the site,” does not constitute either “funds” or a “monetary instrument, either of which is a necessary component of “financial transaction.""  Were Ulbricht and his attorney to win this motion, the report suggests he would still face criminal charges in Maryland relating to a separate federal indictment.  Recent IRS ruling plays key role  In his motion, Dratel made the case that money laundering is clearly limited to the use of certain money instruments, of which bitcoin is not named.  Further, he pointed to last week's ruling by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which ruled that bitcoin should be treated as property and, not a currency, as added evidence that the charges listed against Ulbricht don't fit his alleged crimes.  According to a Wired report, the charges listed by Dratel represent most of those filed against him in New York. The 30-year-old Ulbricht was indicted earlier this February, and eventually entered a plea of not guilty to the charges.  Silk Road case continues  The filing marks the latest chapter in the ongoing saga of Silk Road, which has spawned a variety of cases, including those by the site's supposedly legitimate sellers.  Started in 2011 with the intent to become a kind of anonymous Amazon.com, Silk Road quickly captured the public's imagination as an illicit underground marketplace. Following the arrest of Ulbricht in connection with the case in October, the case itself quickly became the focal point of those who feared Silk Road would be used by the government to pass restrictive regulations on the new digital currency technology.  Despite these concerns, however, governments have increasingly warmed to the idea of digital currencies, with New York most recently opening applications for regulated bitcoin exchanges it expects to be in operation by the end of this year.

42377070,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6xkK9,1396380454,"Coinbase Denies Reports of Data Breach, Addresses Security Concerns","San Francisco-based bitcoin wallet provider Coinbase formally responded to community concerns relating to a design function of its 'Request Money' service on 1st April, amid reports that suggested this service could be misused by phishers and fraudsters.  The response was issued after a Pastebin entry surfaced suggesting that roughly 2,000 Coinbase customer names and emails were compromised as part of a ""data breach"" of the site, rumours that caused widespread speculation on reddit and social media.  Speaking to CoinDesk, the company clarified that, although certain user personal information was posted online, the event was not a data breach, but rather an exploitation of a feature common to popular tech services. Malicious users, it noted, can use an email address to determine if someone has an account on other payment services such as PayPal, Square Cash and Venmo – a process called email enumeration.  Wrote the company in its official response:  ""Though we believe this type of spam and user enumeration activity doesn’t represent a significant risk to Coinbase customers, we absolutely recognize that it can be an inconvenience and cause confusion.""  Coinbase's Request Money feature allows users to request funds by entering an email address. If the recipient is a Coinbase user, the website generates a return email complete with the individual's first and last name, provided they used their real name to register with the service.  Coinbase does not require its users to provide real names, and indicates in its privacy policy that it makes such information available.  However, at least one security official has expressed concern that such information could be used by malicious parties to commit larger fraud.  Origin of the dispute  This functionality was brought to light to the bitcoin community by Australia-based security researcher Shubham Shah, who posted his frustrations on his blog. That post detailed a step-by-step process of how to conduct email enumeration using Coinbase, and lashed out against the company for not taking measures to address his concerns.  Coinbase reviewed the ""design flaw"" as submitted by Shah, but informed him that it would not be looking to implement a fix or issuing a reward for the finding. As such, he decided to publish the claim on his blog.  According to a timeline posted by Shah, the developer first contacted Coinbase on 28th February. The communication was part of a series of correspondences that ended on 31st March, when Shah indicates Coinbase confirmed it had closed his bug report.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Shah indicated that as a security researcher, he felt the responsibility to bring the issue to the community so that it could be addressed. Further, he claimed no affiliation with the subsequent PasteBin posting of customer names and email addresses.  Coinbase's response  Coinbase's blog post explained that despite claims circulating online, the design feature was intentional, and meant to increase the usability of its service. Further, it stated that not implementing a limit on the number of emails that can be generated via its service serves a specific use case.  Said Coinbase:  ""Allowing lists to be invoiced is core functionality of our service, and this functionality is intentionally built into our API.""  In a message dated 31st March, a Coinbase representative offered the company's internal assessment to Shah via HackerOne, an online organisation of security experts that coordinates rewards for hackers who contribute to a safer Internet.  ""We are not considering account existence bugs to be high enough severity for our scope. This behaviour is mostly informational to an attacker and does not directly increase risk in any significant way. We may consider updating this behaviour in the future but do not feel it warrants a reward.""  The representative elaborated that allowing lists to be invoiced was a key aspect of its service, and that it ""would not be any more effective than more traditional phishing methods, which we spend a considerable amount of time preventing"".  Unlikely attacks  In its blog post, Coinbase indicated that only a very small amount of users – less than 0.5% – were named in the user data post today. In addition, it went on to describe why it believes such attacks are incredibly unlikely.  Said Coinbase: ""This list of emails was likely sourced from other sites – probably bitcoin-related ones.""  The company said that malicious users would need to first acquire email addresses, which aren't publicly available online, then send money to recipients who, in turn, would have to choose to send money to unknown users.  Shah indicated that the design flaw is important due to the nature of bitcoin's design.  ""You're not dealing with a normal account. You're dealing with an account that holds digital currency, which is irreversible. It's a little more serious.""  Coinbase acknowledged this concern, though it said it believes it represents a low fraud risk, and is more threatening to users as a spam issue.  Coinbase indicated in its blog post that it is taking the issue of spamming seriously, noting that it employs rate limits on sensitive actions such as requesting money so that they aren't widely abused.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/01/coinbase-denies-reports-of-data-breach-addresses-security-concerns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d8ffc34e6f65b69a76de9a2eee640ad70d84e16e-1033x661.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377076,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6xkRh,1396379376,Trading Site BTC.sx Receives 500 Bitcoins in Seedcoin Funding Round,"Bitcoin derivatives trading site BTC.sx has received a 500-bitcoin investment through seed-funding outfit Seedcoin.  The trading site, which recently had to temporarily close after the demise of partner Mt. Gox, is the sixth company to be funded in Seedcoin's first round – called SF1 – which was announced in December.  Joe Lee, founder of BTC.sx, told CoinDesk:  ""Being funded by [SF1] puts us in a great position while we work to build the security, speed and transparency of our trading system. Being funded means we can proactively work with financial regulators to show them that bitcoin and its growing financial services industry is here to stay.""  BTC.sx's funding represents a quarter of the entire SF1 fund, which hopes to fund seven companies in all.  Varied recipients  In the investment round, bitcoin payment processor Cryptopay received 100 bitcoins, and Hive, which makes a bitcoin wallet for OS X, received 150. CoinSimple, which allows merchants to receive payments via several different bitcoin payment processors, was given 200 bitcoins, as was zSim, a company still in stealth mode that is preparing some kind of SIM-based wallet.  Mexican bitcoin exchange MexBT was the recipient of the second-largest bitcoin funding package under SF1, receiving 250 bitcoins.  Seedcoin is also negotiating with the last of the seven companies that it chose for the SF1 round: GoCoin – a company that provides payment processing services not just for bitcoin, but for litecoin and dogecoin too.  GoCoin, which recently received $1.5m in funding from a separate round led by Bitcoin Shop, also received $550,000 last November from a group of investors including BitAngels.  [post-quote]  The deal with GoCoin is not yet closed, emphasizes Eddy Travia, co-founder of Seedcoin. Once that funding is complete, it won't entirely use up all of the bitcoins in SF1. Some will be held back to meet further funding demands for the included companies.  SF1 is funded through purchases of 'units' via Havelock Investments – originally a Canadian-owned company, which is now located in Panama.  Eighty-nine per cent of the funds collected via Havelock will go into SF1 startups. Seedcoin collects an 11% management fee, and also pays a 5% listing fee, Travia said.  Value halved  This latest funding shows the volatile nature of bitcoins. Had BTC.sx secured the 500 bitcoins in December, when the fund was launched, it would have collected the equivalent of $437,500, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. At today's price, they're worth $241,000.  However, that assumes that BTC.sx is going to cash out the bitcoins entirely, which seems unlikely, given that it is a bitcoin-based derivatives house.  Said Travia:  ""The terms had been agreed only in BTC, not in USD so there is no change regarding our conditions and regarding BTC.sx. Since it is a bitcoin only business they will most probably keep this in bitcoin as long as they can.""  Lee said that BTC.sx works to remain well-hedged against foreign exchange movements in the market. The risk will be hedged within its internal accounts and managed separately from client funds, he added.  BTC.sx  , which reopened for trading on March 12, has processed around $44m in bitcoin-based trades, it said this week. The firm, started less than a year ago by Joe Lee, now has offices in Singapore, London, and New York.  Lee was a one-person operation when he started. Even though the company has grown quickly, there is still a lot to do, he said, arguing that it was difficult even to serve futures and options markets because the lack of an established infrastructure for trading.  He explained:    ""Bitcoin is still in its infancy, and if you look at the products out there, we haven't even got the exchange infrastructure that we need.""      ""The announcement that New York is accepting applications is very exciting for us. That will bring legitimacy, and a lot more trading volume. That will bring us great exchange products. It's a win-win situation.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/01/trading-site-btcsx-receives-500-bitcoins-in-seedcoin-funding-round,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/340588bf8a29b2119b8c475847510c084b80c50c-1124x723.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377082,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6xkZF,1396376842,The Official CoinDesk Crypto April Fools' Day Roundup,"Dogecoin lovers have a habit of criticising bitcoiners for being too serious, even elitist. Since this criticism comes from a group of people who modelled a cryptocurrency around an internet meme, it is not all that easy to dispute.  Bitcoin enthusiasts do tend to be a much more serious crowd, for better or for worse.  However, this does not mean that they can't let their hair down once a year. After all, dogecoin lovers do it every single day.  There was no shortage of elaborate and downright silly April Fools' Day stories today, so we decided to compile a small roundup – we're here to inform and entertain, so let's see what the cryptocurrency community came up with.  Exchanges need to have fun too  BTC-e offered a healthy dose of Eastern European humour. The homepage was turned upside down, but anyone who cheated their way through school could still read it, along with practical jokers who like to flip their co-workers screens in Windows.  Bitcoinity  reintroduced Mt. Gox on its charts, but clicking the link would simply play the Muppet Show theme tune.  As for Mt. Gox, it never really needed an April Fools anyway, since it's been nothing but a joke all along – and a terrible one at that.  Regulator puns and prank coins  Bitcoin Magazine's Vitalik Buterin ran a story on a new People's Bank of China ruling, which found the central bank banning all jokes on April 1st.  The official notice advised all media institutions to refrain from making statements of ""fraudulent comedy"" or use the day for whimsical announcements. Vitalik also managed to work in some conspiracy theory comedy, courtesy of BTC China CEO Bobby Lee, or not.  In response the CEO of Bitcoin™ Warren Winkleberg decided to ban China, and naturally CoinDesk got the scoop. We did get a bit of flak for it, as there are many people who believe such headlines could prompt trading bots to go on a selling frenzy, or that the prank could be lost in translation.  This probably isn't the case, but anything is possible in an unregulated market, so let's see what happens. If a single prank can negatively affect the price, that's newsworthy in itself. Consider it a FUD stress test of sorts, courtesy of CoinDesk.  A number of prank coins were launched, too. TechCrunch, which recently awarded bitcoin one of its highly coveted Crunchie awards, launched CrunchCoin.  ""CrunchCoin can be purchased with litecoin. Litecoin can be purchased with bitcoin. Bitcoin can be purchased with dollars. Sometimes,"" said TechCrunch.  Redditors on fire  Many lulz were to be had on reddit today. Bitcoinnotbombs reported that major US defence contractor Raytheon is now accepting bitcoin, which is good news for dictators and James Bond villains living in hollowed-out volcanoes. They can now buy best-selling Raytheon products, like the BGM-109 Tomahawk and the mighty RIM-161 Standard SM3, anonymously.  Here is a word of CoinDesk consumer advice – give the sleek RIM-162 ESSM a try. It's not a headline grabber, but it is an excellent and cost effective point-defence missile that can be quad packed in existing VLS launchers, saving precious room for more Tomahawks.  Leah McGrath Goodman, the journalist who named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto as the real Satoshi in a Newsweek article, also joined the fun, allegedly. The CoinFront reports that McGrath Goodman admitted to creating bitcoin while trying to skim pennies off bank transactions.  ""I accidentally put a zero in the wrong place, and the result was bitcoin,"" she did not tell CoinFront.  Much dogecoin pranks  Every day is April Fools' Day in the dogecoin universe, which is one of the reasons we have a soft spot for doge. The Missouri University of Science and Technology went into full doge mode, with too many puns to count. It was truly an elaborate prank with much Comic Sans.  Google's geekish April Fools' pranks are legendary and every year the company has a dozen or so different jokes for different tech savvy audiences. Today, it ran a job listing for a Software Dogengineer. Responsibilities include writing much web-based code, very programming, so <script></script> and ""so skills in snake programming"".  In fact, the listing is so hilarious that we can safely say Google out-doged many dogecoin lovers out there.

42377080,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6xkWj,1396373348,"Professor Susan Athey: 'If People Use It, Bitcoin Has Intrinsic Value'","Susan Athey is a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economics Policy Research, specializing in auction-based marketplaces and the economics of the Internet. She is also an advisor at Ripple Labs and serves as Microsoft's Chief Economist.  Athey brought an independent academic perspective to discussions at CoinSummit San Francisco last week, using her expertise and research to assess the technology's potential on many fronts.  CoinDesk spoke to Athey about what gives bitcoin intrinsic value, the novelty of the Bitcoin protocol, possible scenarios for bitcoin's future, and the currency's value as an investment.  CoinDesk: When we saw your name and credentials listed on the agenda, we thought maybe this is the responsible grownup who is going to tell us how crazy bitcoin is and how it won't work. But it seems like after examining bitcoin with a skeptical academic eye, you are not dismissing it. When you first looked into bitcoin were you sceptical?  Susan Athey: I was introduced to bitcoin by some early aficionados. The first things I read when I got home were about bubbles. I pulled out my books about asset bubbles and tulips, and I worried that it was a Ponzi scheme in the sense that a lot of rich people were investing in it and telling their rich friends to invest in it, and so the price was going up as rich people were putting their money into it.  Also, the arguments in favour of it by some of the early adopters didn't resonate with me: the idea that we needed it because something terrible was going to happen to the US dollar. In steady state as a store of value there may be better financial instruments.  Right now the price is growing, so it's a good investment because the upside offsets the risk. But if it were in steady state and no longer growing, there may be better ways to protect your money than bitcoin in the United States.  What fascinated me and captured my imagination was the technology itself, understanding what the ledger meant, what it accomplished, and why a native currency was essential to the overall technology.  Let me unpack that a little bit. When we start thinking about the actual technology, the block chain, the ledger and the security around the ledger, that's clearly a powerful thing. We have lots of other expensive and cumbersome institutions to establish that things of value have moved in ownership from one person to another. The block chain doing that in a decentralized, frictionless way – a pure way – is a powerful innovation.  But then the first question you ask is, 'Why did you need to invent a new currency? Was that a gimmick? Something that you added on, a marketing tool to sell this thing that was really just a ledger?' Then I realized that bitcoin itself is sort of fundamental to the ledger.  Let me explain that. I could have entries in a ledger that describe ownership of dollar bills. I could, in principal, use a security protocol: If I owned a ledger entry I could send a message to move a dollar to someone else. But that would just be a message. It would be a promise. We haven't invented the technology to beam dollar bills and have them appear on your keyboard.  The SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) international system is a system of messages that tells people where money has moved, and then underneath it, the money actually moves through clearinghouse systems. Being able to send messages is very powerful, but it's not as powerful as actually being able to send value.  The bitcoin is the only thing where the complete definition of ownership is the entry on the ledger. It has to be a native and new currency because the definition of the object is the ledger entry. That doesn't correspond to a dollar or a piece of gold or something else. It is what it is. The entry on a ledger of a bitcoin is a fundamental unit whose value can be moved electronically through the security protocol.  Does the value of the technology mean that it's not a bubble or a Ponzi scheme?  It's a technology that can be used in a variety of ways. We're perfectly capable of coming up with Ponzi schemes in the old economy. I couldn't say that you couldn't put a Ponzi scheme on top of bitcoin. But the technology has use and so, to me, the thing that gives bitcoin its fundamental value is its use.  The ability to move value electronically without counter parties and without IOUs and promises is very useful. If people use it, it will have value. That's what makes me think that it does have intrinsic value.  One way to think about the transaction volume and the intrinsic value is that, at any moment in time, there's a fixed number of bitcoins, and suppose you want to run half a billion dollars-worth of transactions through the system in a day.  There's a fixed number of bitcoins, and a dollar value of transactions that needs to be supported on them, and each bitcoin can only be used once in a day, then the market cap of the bitcoins would have to rise to support the dollar value of transactions. There's a market price for access to the bitcoins.  You have examined the relationship between transaction volume and price. So are you saying that the volume that you saw justifies the price?  Yes. That's not a complete theory of price, because if the volume is driven by speculation, it's possible that the volume could support the price, but it's still possible that the price could fall, and the volume could fall.  I'm just saying that 'the volume justifies the price' isn't a complete theory of what the future price should be. It's more of a high level impressionistic view of the market that the prices and the transaction volume have moved together in a way that makes sense.  In steady state, when speculation is no longer the primary driver of volume, then it would be possible to relate the transaction volume to the price in a more defensible way.  A lot of the volume is related to speculation. What you might like to do is look at the parts of the ecosystem that are really being used for commerce. That transaction volume is the thing that will matter if you're at a steady state. If it gets to a steady state size, then people are no longer coming into it because they think it's going to grow. And then the value is determined more by the transactions on the system.  I have a very simple theory of what the price should look like in steady state. That theory, when applied to what happens today, doesn't do badly in matching up with the data, but we're not in steady state right now, so the theory is incomplete.  I have heard people warn that, one day, this value is going to evaporate and nobody is going to want bitcoins anymore.  It could happen. Let me give some of the scenarios where it would happen. One might be that there's a security flaw found, or some sort of attack occurs that undermines the trust in bitcoin.  Given where we are today, I would imagine that in that scenario we would migrate onto an alternative coin. This is one reason why I think it's good for the bitcoin ecosystem to have a number of other coins out there, because if something catastrophic happened to bitcoin, I think we could move in a pretty orderly fashion to another alt-currency, and while certainly there would be some redistribution of wealth in that transition process, the overall investments in the ecosystem would be maintained.  The venture capitalists are backing a number of firms in the virtual currency space. Most of them could pivot to another virtual currency with relatively little effort. In terms in the application layer, yes, it's specific to bitcoin, but if it needed to, it could pivot.  Now, we understand the security properties of bitcoin very well. There would be a period of uncertainty with that new protocol and that testing process could lead to migration to a third alt-currency.  So if something catastrophic happened to the Bitcoin protocol, there would be disruption and there might be a period of uncertainty as we figured out what would be the best alternative, and maybe a rebirth of bitcoin once they had fixed whatever the problem was.  So, if people think everybody else is leaving bitcoin, everybody will get out of bitcoin, and the price will fall. There are many other types of businesses and investments that have that property.  For example, a marketplace that needs buyers and sellers. If the buyers and sellers all started migrating to another platform, you could see that. Think about a social network. We saw people using MySpace, and then they migrated to Facebook. We see many types of platforms and institutions and firms where the utility of the platform is based on other users using it.  That doesn't mean you can't value a Facebook, just because things are only useful when other people are using them. The risk profile of a bitcoin investment is less like a really safe store of value.  I actually look at it more like the risk profile of, say, a marketplace startup that has an initial user base. If the users stay and they interact with each other and it grows, it will have a lot of value. If the users pick another platform for whatever reason, then you won't have any value. If you were buying stock or taking a venture position in this kind of a startup, you would realize there's some probability of it going to zero and there's some probability it's going to grow big.  That's the way that I look at bitcoin: there's some probability that people shift to another platform for whatever reason; if they don't, it grows and it has intrinsic value based on the transaction volume.  You consult with world governments on economic issues. Have you discussed bitcoin with national or international economic authorities? Are there widely divergent views around the world in regard to whether bitcoin is going to be important, whether they fear it, are ignoring it, and so on? What is the vibe you are getting?  One thing that's kind of interesting is that the individual people from the various branches of government who have gotten interested in it, like almost everyone who takes a look at this, become fascinated by it.  This is just really interesting and challenging and intellectually fun. It's fun because it's hard. To think through all the implications of this new technology and to think through all the ways that various regulations could have good and bad consequences is a challenging problem. So one vibe that I get is that they, like the rest of the community, find it really intellectually engaging and challenging.  A message that I have found to be resonating is that it is very important that the environment in the US is friendly enough that the ecosystem stays here, because there are a lot of resources in the US to support that, and a lot of those resources will also encourage that development to favour more legitimate uses and safe uses. If it becomes illegal then it develops more in [unwanted] directions. It is in the US national interest to have this ecosystem develop here.  And you think that people in authority in the US understand that?  I think they do. Now, understanding that and being able to act on it in a timely and clear way are different things. No individual regulator can solve the whole problem, and banking regulation is an extremely challenging and complex area. But as it sinks in that this protocol and technology is here to stay, and that it needs to be dealt with, then the attention turns to dealing with it right.  At a fundamental level, you can certainly throw tacks in the road. You can make it difficult to buy things. Like the latest tax ruling makes it challenging for people to comply with tax law; they need to do a lot more accounting if they're using bitcoin for small transactions.  For bitcoin investors, the tax ruling is actually helpful, because it provided clarity. If you're just buying and selling, the tax ruling was quite simple. For someone who had a stash and was spending them on small purchases, you will probably need accounting software to file your taxes properly.  Those kinds of things can certainly be tacks in the road. Lack of clarity in banking relationships is a huge hurdle in the road. But at a fundamental level, you can't really outlaw a ledger. This is a piece of computer software that has lots of different uses. You can regulate how fiat currency goes in and out of it, but you can't really stop it from being used.  Some of its uses don't relate directly to currency at all, some of the multi-signature applications where you have multiple people signing a transaction, keeping things in escrow, title, applications where you're using this as a way to send a public message that has a timestamp that verifies it. Companies could build their own internal ledger. They could just fork the Bitcoin protocol, they don't need to move any money in and out of banks, they just use this ledger to manage their internal books, if they move money across divisions within the firm.  There are lots of these applications out there, and many of them don't really require the approval of regulators. Once you recognize that the technology's out of the bag, it can't be stopped, it has lots of interesting applications, it only makes sense to put a framework around it that makes it possible for it to work.  Are you working on research papers or projects related to bitcoin?  I've been working on analyzing the block chain and trying to describe the evolution of the block chain over time, what kinds of transactions are occurring, trying to document the flows of funds ...  It's a pretty challenging exercise to do well because of the idiosyncrasies of the way the block chain records information: the fact that there's not one wallet number to one individual or entity on the block chain, and they don't have any identifying information.  At an individual level you have a fair bit of noise in understanding what's going on, on the level of a single block chain transaction. But you can still look at aggregate patterns. I'm doing research in this area.  It's a bit time-consuming to get it right, but interesting patterns emerge from understanding the block chain. It's only going to become more interesting as companies like BitPay expand their reach and allow more and more people to do transactions.  If actual people buying and selling things is only a few per cent of what's going on, it's a little bit less interesting to analyze, but that's changing. I think that real commerce is in the double digits on the block chain, and it's growing. People finding utility from the block chain, from an economic perspective, is much more interesting to study. I'm doing research and also in parallel waiting for the community to evolve to the point that it's more interesting economically.  Is this a popular topic that graduate students want to sign on to research?  There's a lot of interest. [However] there are not very many people yet who have mastered the technology required to study it well. My guess would be that within a year you'll see an explosion of analyses.  Based on my own experience, there's a pretty big startup cost to sort through all the institutional details, to really convince yourself that you've understood the informational content of the block chain. Think about some of the things that change over time.  People use anonymization techniques in order to disguise themselves. Use of that and the way that works changes over time. The identities of the exchanges and the way they interact with the block chain change over time. Some services do a lot of stuff off the block chain, while other services do a lot of things on the block chain.  It's a moving target and a complex target to understand what's on the block chain, what's off the block chain. There's a barrier to entry with this research, but I think people will surmount that barrier.  Have you purchased any bitcoins yourself?  To study any market you need to be a participant in the market, to understand the user experience and wrap your head around it. So I've been in and out of bitcoin, but at a low level. I've tried to try out different exchanges, and as new firms come on I've tried to experiment with them and see how they work.  If I was in the position of doing a lot of more risky investments, I think it totally makes sense that a lot of the wealthier investors have taken a position here. It's got a very interesting growth profile.  One thing I would say about investing in it: most Americans should be holding US dollars and index funds. That's the tried and true way to hold money. But for people who are looking for the kind of risk profile that's associated with new ventures, which is some probability of zero and some probability of growth, an interesting thing about investing in bitcoin is that it democratizes access to an investment of that profile.  You as an individual are not offered a share of a venture capital fund. You can't buy that. You have to be a large investor, and even if you're a large investor, you still have to be invited to participate. So it's interesting that not only has bitcoin democratized access to moving money, but also, at the moment, buying bitcoin is like taking a stake in a startup. That's a risky bet, but it's got high growth potential.  Instead of investing in five bitcoin startups, you can buy just bitcoin, and that's probably going to go with the bitcoin startups. The one caveat to that is that many of the bitcoin startups could pivot if the Bitcoin protocol blew up. The bitcoin itself could go down.  One of the things about investing in bitcoin is that you wouldn't want to be caught unawares if something started shifting, if another protocol started gaining traction.  So there are some issues with holding bitcoin, but it's an opportunity if you wanted to take a very risky position in your portfolio, high risk/high return. It's a much more liquid way to get that investment profile than many other investments that have the same risk/return profile.

42377072,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6xkNv,1396369092,Why Goldman Sachs Got it Wrong on Bitcoin,"“Bitcoin likely can’t work as a currency, but some sense that the ledger-based technology that underlies it could hold promise,” concludes a Goldman Sachs report titled 'Top of Mind'.      Bitcoin has attracted major league attention in the finance world, and most seem to share the views expressed in the report. While increased research and interest from Wall Street is good for bitcoin overall, the report misses the mark with its conclusion and underscores several systematically flawed views of the digital currency and its future role in finance.      While credit should be given to Goldman Sachs for taking a more in-depth look at cryptocurrencies, its report showcases inaccurate commentary of bitcoin's current and future hurdles, often reflecting common argumentative fallacies that have been rampant amongst analysts and pundits alike.    One-sided view    Bitcoin lies at the intersection of technology and economics, and the fallacious arguments against it span both these areas. This is really no surprise, as most economists and financial analyst don’t have extensive technological knowledge, and are prone to making errors in reasoning because of this.      Yet the technological significance of the Bitcoin protocol – in particular, its ability to transmit ownership between individuals without a third party – is hard for even the harshest critics to downplay.      Similarly, the accompanying high-speed and ultra-cheap transactions of this system are real achievements with measurable benefits.      To be fair, the GS report does conclude the block chain ledger system that underlies bitcoin indeed has real promise, not just in monetary transactions but in countless other fields. However, this is where most of the praise stops.      Wrote Dominic Wilson and Jose Usrua, two of the report's authors:      “Bitcoin currently shows more promise in terms of its payments technology than as a stable store of value.”              They have a point, given the current state of bitcoin. While volatility may be rampant, transaction fees for merchants are much lower, and money movement is much cheaper and faster.      One could argue this makes it likely that bitcoin is destined take on a role more like that of Paypal, than to replace any entrenched currency. In fact, the report even goes on to illustrate the pure potential of the efficiency of these transactional advantages by estimating that the global economy could save more than $210bn annually if bitcoin became the default means of payment and remittances.    Problem solved    Yet despite this staggering number, in regard to bitcoin's potential as a store of value, Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs, remarks:      “The replacement of an old commodity with a new commodity typically occurred precisely because the new commodity solved an economic problem that the old commodity could not. For example, coal replaced wood when fuel was needed for steam engines. So the question is: is there an economic problem with gold as a store of value that bitcoin solves? The short answer is no.”              Wood did not fail in itself as a store of energy, coal was simply much more efficient and suitable for growing and changing industrial demands. Similarly bitcoin – as we can clearly see from the Goldman Sachs' own report – is vastly more efficient, and able to meet the demands of a global economy in a way that a patchwork of national fiat currencies cannot, let alone chunks of gold.      The latter two require trust in third parties – including national governments – as well as clunky traditional financial infrastructure that takes days to transfer funds between owners.      To borrow Curries' analogy, if the transition from wood to coal is what allowed the industrial revolution to really take off, then the transition from national currencies to cryptocurrency is what will allow an explosion of global trade and development with little precedent.    Highs and lows    Yet detractors would rightly point out that there is still the lingering problem of volatility. A currency that suffers from frequent swings in value on a regular basis can’t, and indeed shouldn’t be adopted by the mass market as a means to move value around.      The average consumer can’t afford to gamble whether they will be able to afford basic necessities tomorrow on the value of a fluctuating currency.      This is the insurmountable problem with bitcoin cited by many economists and financial analysts, and is one of the reasons another of the report's authors, Eric Posner, remarks:      “Twenty years from now, use of the bitcoin – or other similar, perhaps improved networks – could very well be part of the process where you send money from one place to another, but an unobservable part of the process. In other words, firms that transfer money may find it in their interest to use this technology to transfer money, but it is not going to look that different to ordinary consumers. I think that is the most likely way that this plays out.”              For Posner and many others, the solution is as simple as stripping the 'technology' that allows bitcoin to be so frictionless and implementing it in the current financial infrastructure. UBS has recently made similar statements as well.      What they fail to grasp, however, is that Bitcoin the protocol and bitcoin the currency are inseparable. Bitcoins are units that exist only in the block chain, and aren’t tied down to any existing financial infrastructure. It is because bitcoin is separate from the traditional ways of moving money that it is so frictionless.      Cryptocurrencies aren’t going to simply improve the current financial system, they threaten to uproot it completely.    Adoption is key    The Bitcoin protocol can’t function without its own independent unit or share, this is why you can’t use the same technology to move fiat around, and also why volatility isn’t a long term problem.      Merchants are already flocking to bitcoin in exponential fashion due to its low 1% transaction costs. The savings are a no brainer. Meanwhile consumers are adopting it for everything from lowering travel expenses by eliminating the need for expensive and cumbersome currency exchanges, to greater economic and financial freedom.      While the trend is clear, “inevitability is not a strategy” points out Adam Hanft in a recent CoinDesk article, and there are things that can be done to further spur consumer adoption of bitcoin.      As the transactional usage of bitcoin continues to increase, however, taking advantage of the payment system side that Goldman Sachs has identified, the price will undoubtedly continue to stabilize. As this process continues, merchants will feel comfortable keeping some bitcoin instead of converting it immediately to fiat.      This reddit post illustrates how one business is already doing this, and paying its first invoice with bitcoin too. Once this starts happening en masse, and bitcoin begins flowing steadily around the global economy without touching exchanges, the digital currency will truly start to become a stable and independent store of value.      That’s when things will start getting interesting. When this tipping point is reached, there is no reason bitcoin shouldn’t be considered a fully fledged currency – one that is far more efficient and attractive than current fiat monies to boot.    Borrowing from bitcoin    Now can a government theoretically create its own currency using the open-source code of bitcoin? In other words, 'adapt' the technology of bitcoin as the authors of the Goldman Sachs report expect is likely? Of course, but then just like any other altcoin it would have to compete in the marketplace.      In fact Eric Posner stipulated that:      “Probably the most important reason why [bitcoin] would not be a good substitute is that we actually do want the government to control the money supply.""              This, of course, is fundamental to the closed nature and centralized decision making of central banks like the Federal Reserve, and the constant annual devaluation of currencies to 'stimulate' the economy and endlessly fund expanding government debt.      What Posner doesn’t seem to grasp is that these 'selling points', if you can call them that, are irrelevant to the average individual who just wants to save costs and move money around more efficiently. Individuals want a currency for its ability to stimulate trade and store wealth, not so central authorities can test out their monetary theories on an economy.    Maintaining a monopoly    Even if this wasn’t the case, the very argument that annual inflation can stimulate the economy is nonsense. And when the conversion and exchange costs are removed from the Goldman Sachs estimates, global savings from bitcoin increase from $210bn to $326bn annually. If that isn’t an economic stimulus, then what is?    A new coin in the fiercely open and competitive cryptocurrency market based on the centralized and inflationary design of current national currencies would, simply put, be slaughtered. It would lose every time to decentralized coins with a stable and eventually static money supply when it comes to consumer choice.  With a ready and superior alternative like bitcoin available, assuming it can sustain a stable value and widespread merchant acceptance, in the long term there is ultimately no reason to keep using fiat currencies.  The monetary policies that have been all the rage in academia for decades cannot be implemented without a total monopoly of money by the governments. Can governments outlaw cryptocurrency to try and maintain its monopoly on the money supply, and thus control over monetary policy? Not likely.  That nonetheless brings us to an important question. If the only thing keeping fiat currency and monetary policy functioning is forceful use, then which is the real ponzi scheme here again?

42377086,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6xkeH,1396367226,ZipZap CEO: Argentina's Volatility Makes Bitcoin Look Stable,"CoinDesk spoke to Alan Safahi, CEO of cash-to-bitcoins service ZipZap, about its big entry into the Latin American market, bitcoin as a 'leapfrog technology' in the world's more volatile economies, and whether the company's recent issues with payment processor PayPoint would have any impact in future.  Alan Safahi has just come back from San Francisco's CoinSummit where he says he spent far too much time fending off questions about whether his company would continue operations, after recent media articles.  ""Rumors of our death were exaggerated,"" he laughs, paraphrasing Mark Twain. ""I was surprised at the power of the press.""  On the contrary, ZipZap is looking to expand in many new areas, while maintaining existing ones. Last month's issue was simply one of a payment processor who expected a slow trickle of bitcoin-related business, but instead got a tsunami – too much of a good thing, if you will.  ZipZap is still working with PayPoint to address the processor's concerns about bitcoin's exact legal status in the UK, while at the same time diversifying its options both commercially and geographically.  Into Brazil  ZipZap already operates in five countries, and has just quietly slipped into a sixth and major one: Brazil. Having run first a closed, and then open, beta there for a few weeks, the service went live last week, with a Portuguese language site inviting locals to try it out.  The company has also worked as a payment option supporting exchange partners in the country for about two years, including the now-defunct BitInstant.  All without doing much marketing to promote it – yet.  ZipZap decided to move out of the background and promote its services under its own name, doing its own KYC (know your customer) procedures and allowing consumers to buy bitcoin directly. Exchanges often just aren't in the business of new customer acquisition, Safahi indicates.  ""We talked to exchanges and a lot of them really didn't want to go after Latin America,"" he said. ""Everybody's focused on Europe and Asia.""  ""We have a very aggressive plan to educate and acquire new customers. We thought Brazil would be a good market for that, it's a huge powerhouse in Latin America,"" he added.  ""Brazil has a bitcoin-friendly environment, with banking and so forth,"" Safahi continued. ""And we think there's a lot of good potential use cases with remittances for Latin America that Brazil could help us get into.""  As is often the case with bitcoin, much of the promise lies in weaknesses with current financial and economic structures: instability, poverty, and lack of access to banking services – including credit cards, even for large sections of the middle class.  ""I see a lot more potential in Latin America,"" he said. ""Eighty-five per cent in some countries are unbanked. In these unbanked economies, people will just jump over the existing payment options, like Visa and MasterCard, and just go to the next generation: digital currency.""  Said Safahi:  ""It's just like in Kenya and other places where they don't have landline phones. But they have a lot of mobile phones; it's easier for them to just leapfrog one technology, go to the next one. So I think that's what's going to happen in Latin America.""  What volatility?  There's no point talking about the risks of bitcoin's volatility to the people of Latin America, as most of them have experienced far worse with their own national currencies.  ""We see a lot of pent-up demand for bitcoin in Argentina."" said Safahi. ""I was there a couple of months ago – people in the streets come up to you and try to convert your dollars into bitcoin. They say 'cambio, cambio'; they know how to do currency conversion with bitcoin.""  ""Taxi drivers there know about bitcoin,"" he added. ""I've never seen a country where people are so in tune with financial services as they are in Argentina.""  Then there are countries like Venezuela and Nicaragua, with their closed economies and strict financial controls that do nothing to encourage real commerce or small businesses.  ""Those are the markets where bitcoin volatility actually looks really good!"" said Safahi. ""At the conference, people kept asking 'What can we do to manage the volatility of bitcoin?' and I said, 'just take bitcoin to markets where volatility doesn't look bad'.""  He added:  ""There are probably about 60-70% of countries in the world you could go to right now, where bitcoin actually looks stable.""  First-world problems  The problem with developed countries is that there often doesn't seem to be any urgent need for a new payment system. The average consumer doesn't understand the economic case for sound, non-government controlled money and local fiat currencies have been stable enough to provide a sense of security.  It's difficult to get consumers in the developed world to switch to bitcoin, Safahi said, because they're not particularly inconvenienced now. People may complain sometimes, but they're generally satisfied with credit cards, both in-store and online.  Even merchants, who may gripe about chargeback fraud and processing fees, seem more comfortable in the current system and aren't rushing en masse to adopt or encourage bitcoin use. Few offer discounts for digital currency, treating it almost as a favor to enthusiasts or a gimmick to attract a bit more business and attention.  Safahi said:  ""Libertarians, die-hard fans, will flock to a store that accepts bitcoin. But that novelty wears off. So what are you going to do, two months later, when another competitor comes in?""  Remittances and micropayments  Safahi sees remittances and micropayments as being far more significant bitcoin use cases to consider than regular e-commerce in developed countries.  ""While everyone here is into e-commerce and they get all excited about Overstock.com,"" he said, ""we're looking at building railways that can get rid of Moneygram and Western Union.""  Explained Safahi:  ""Globally there's $540bn in remittances, and $70bn in fees. If we could get rid of that, and just do it through bitcoin, [...] then we'd add about $70bn in cash to those countries.""  Even though affordable remittances is one of the more obvious applications for digital currencies, and one that could help humanity, it too is riddled with regulatory pitfalls that have prevented several efforts so far, thanks to money laundering and terrorism financing concerns.  Then there is regular e-commerce on a smaller, yet international, scale. Bitcoin allows small amounts of money to be sent anywhere at almost no cost, which could be a boon for anyone in the developing world with something to sell – whether it's a manufactured product, creative work or service that can be arranged or delivered online. Even a few more dollars here and there could lift a lot of people out of poverty.  ZipZap's role  For payments like those above to work, especially remittances, there needs to be reliable on and off ramps at each end. ZipZap aims to be the facilitator for this, working not just with bitcoin, but also Ripple and other digital currencies.  ""ZipZap is currently focused only on the on-ramp,"" said Safahi, ""but in the next few months we have plans to offer cash-out options, in 90-plus countries.""  There's also a need for education. Money-changers and taxi drivers on the streets of Buenos Aires might love bitcoin, but there's still a lot of curious people who need to be guided gently into what sometimes looks like a daunting new system.  ""When I got into the Internet in the early '90s,"" Safahi said, ""there was a saying that everyone needs a brother-in-law in the Internet business, someone you could go to, to ask all those kinds of beginner questions.""  ""Now everyone needs a brother-in-law in the bitcoin business, he continued. ""We want to be that person, to educate and teach them. So we're not going after high-frequency traders, we're going after noobs, first-time buyers, making it really easy for them to buy their first $15-$20 worth of bitcoin.""  Added Safahi:  ""At the [CoinSummit] conference, Andreas Antonopoulos told me he bought his first bitcoins through ZipZap [...] Imagine how many more Andreases we could be cultivating if we were bringing more people into the ecosystem.""  Familiar systems  ZipZap has tapped into an existing payment option that's very popular in Brazil known as Boleto Bancário or just Boleto – a payment ticket system allowing customers to print receipts and pay with cash at over 3000 convenient outlets like post offices, banks, even some stores. You can also transfer funds online from a bank account.  ""Familiarity breeds trust, so if we tap into a system they're already used to, it's much easier to gain trust,"" Safahi said.  ""Brazil's just our first stop in Latin America, in the next few weeks we're adding about eight more countries including Peru, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and others,"" he went on. ""Our goal is to really go deep and go heavy into Latin America.  ""Our goal is to build a network and encourage people to use it for remittances. Even if we don't go after the remittance market directly, we want other people to build solutions for it on top of our railway.""  Rest of the world  ZipZap is also active in other regions, and is talking to people in places like India and Southeast Asia, to name a few. Safahi says he doesn't subscribe to the notion that you should find one physical location and focus on it. Bitcoin's ever-changing regulatory environment makes it unwise for a company to put all its resources in one place.  ""That's what you have to do to build this kind of thing,"" said Safahi. ""The corridors have to be built on both sides and conditions can turn on a dime. You have to be ready to do business in multiple locations.""  Funding and locations  ZipZap is funded primarily by Blumberg Capital and TriplePoint Ventures. It's undergoing a seed extension round to facilitate growth in these new markets – not just Brazil, but the UK and even the US. It then hopes to go for Series A funding after a few more months.  This means the new international focus isn't going to divert ZipZap's attention away from the UK. On the contrary, it plans to announce a deal with a new payment processor in the coming week and is maintaining its relationship with PayPoint.  On top of that, it's already formed a new entity in nearby e-commerce and gambling haven, the Isle of Man.  ""We're not down,"" said Safahi. ""It's going to take a lot more than that to get us out of the UK. And Isle of Man is really interesting. They're very friendly with bitcoin.""  The company looked at other small jurisdictions, from Gibraltar to Singapore, but settled on the Isle of Man due to its ""progressive"" approach to technology and banking, as well as its proximity to the UK and Ireland.  ""We're doubling down on the UK. We're not going anywhere.""

42377073,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6xkPB,1396364624,Bitcoin Community Raises Cash for Dorian Nakamoto and Hal Finney,"The bitcoin community has launched fundraisers for two individuals involved in bitcoin's creation five years ago – or at least one of them is.  So far, the community has raised $21,000 for Dorian S Nakamoto, a humble Californian retiree who was named as the creator of bitcoin by Lea McGrath Goodman's controversial Newsweek cover story.  Nakamoto insists that he has nothing to do with bitcoin. Rather than living like a millionaire, he appears to lead a very humble life, which prompted some members of the bitcoin community to launch a fundraiser. After all, it seems Nakamoto was hounded for no reason.  Antonopoulos behind the drive  The fundraiser was organised by bitcoin evangelist Andreas Antonopoulos. More than $21,000 was raised in total and the bitcoins are about to be converted into dollars and handed to Nakamoto. Antonopoulos told Forbes that he is keeping the event low key in order to avoid another storm of publicity. Should Nakamoto refuse to accept the donation, the money will be given to the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  Antonopoulos accepts that it is ""increasingly unlikely"" that Dorian Nakamoto is the real Satoshi but that it does not matter. If he is the creator of bitcoin, the money will be a ""small thanks"" but if he is not, then the money is just the bitcoin community's way of apologising for what he and his family have been through in recent weeks.  The Nakamoto family still maintains Dorian had nothing to do with bitcoin and that he is just a retired techie who takes care of his family and spends his spare time building elaborate model trains.  Forbes writer starts fundraiser for Hal Finney  Much has been said of Newsweek's coverage in the Dorian Nakamoto affair and many in the bitcoin community were outraged and openly hostile after more information started trickling out. However, Forbes is not Newsweek.  Following Newsweek’s botched scoop, Forbes staff writer Andy Greenberg started looking for the real Satoshi and his search led him to Hal Finney, a bitcoin pioneer who worked with Satoshi Nakamoto in the early days of bitcoin.  Finney needs no introduction, as many cryptocurrency lovers already know who he is and what he contributed to bitcoin development. Many also know that Finney is suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a terminal disease that has rendered Finney paralyzed.  The cryptographer pulled out of bitcoin development after he was diagnosed with the condition. Finney's wife Fran is his full-time caregiver. She told Forbes that the family never had a lot of bitcoins stashed away for a rainy day, denying rumours to the contrary. These same rumours prompted an extortion attempt on the family last year.  After Greenberg's article was published last week, it quickly gained a lot of attention and Greenberg launched a fundraiser for Hal and Fran:    Donate bitcoins here to support Hal Finney: 18wfs69iiLUivru32EmVu4bmvrunBLptyN (via @franfinney) Full story here: http://t.co/g4ySg4eqKI      — Andy Greenberg (@a_greenberg) March 31, 2014      It's unclear whether Dorian Nakamoto had anything do to with bitcoin (probably not) but we do know that Finney was instrumental in the creation of the protocol and that he happens to be the first person to ever receive a bitcoin transaction.  With all that in mind, he surely deserves a few more in his time of need.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/01/bitcoin-community-raises-cash-for-dorian-nakamoto-and-hal-finney,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c1b9d09ed1e11581af0762917cd409348a4d9c61-2560x1809.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377088,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6xkgn,1396359025,Will Bitcoin Venture Capital Investment Reach $300 Million in 2014?,"UPDATE (2nd April 11:15 GMT): In addition to the companies listed below, sales portal BitSimple has raised $600,000 in a bitcoin-only seed round.      This article summarizes some of the new State of Bitcoin 2014 data and analysis on venture capital investment presented at last week’s Coinsummit conference in San Francisco.  Several significant venture capital investments in bitcoin startups have been announced in recent weeks, including Circle’s $17m second round, Xapo’s $20m first round, and OKCoin’s $10m first round (Table 1). Table 1: Bitcoin Venture Capital Investments – 2014 YTD  The $72m in 2014 year-to-date venture capital invested in bitcoin startups which has been publicly disclosed (much more has been made quietly) has dramatically advanced CoinDesk's full-year projection published in last month’s State of Bitcoin report.  Just a month ago, the 2014 run rate for venture capital invested in bitcoin startups was just over $100m. Now, $300m is projected for the full 2014 year. The 2014 run rate would equal three times more than the approximately $100m which VCs invested into bitcoin startups in 2013.  Europe lags, Asia is lean, North America dominates  The regional trends identified in the February report have continued to hold with North America outpacing both Europe and Asia both in terms of total number of companies and total investment (Chart 1).  Chart 1: Regional Bitcoin Venture Capital Investments – all time    75% of all bitcoin venture funding has been invested in North America and 57% of VC-backed companies are based there.    Asia venture-backed bitcoin companies appear to be the most leanly funded, with 31% of the total number of bitcoin startups receiving only 15% of the funding pie.  Chart 2: Silicon Valley vs Rest of World – all time  Silicon Valley’s  share of the bitcoin startup ecosystem remains strong. The total number of bitcoin VC-backed companies based in the Valley climbed from 27% last month to 29%.  However, it’s total share of bitcoin startup funding declined to slightly under half at 46% from 51%. Overall, investing in bitcoin startups is very much a global phenomenon, but North America and Silicon Valley still hold pole position.  Six different bitcoin company types  With Circle at last unveiling a part of its business and product strategy the lay of the bitcoin land has now come into sharper focus (Chart 3).  Chart 3: Bitcoin Startup Ecosystem and Sample Companies  Four of the the six distinct company categories defined by CoinDesk are, in essence, pure plays on a specific area of the bitcoin value chain: mining hardware, wallets, exchanges, and payment processors.  The ‘financial services’ category is also comprised of a number pure play companies. However, many companies are either pursuing a unique business strategy, or are small in their total number and size. Therefore, these companies do not yet warrant the creation of a separate ecosystem startup category and are aggregated under the heading of ‘financial services’.  The emergence of the ‘universal’ bitcoin company  Building on the emerging theme of consolidation expressed both in last month’s State of Bitcoin report and in recent analysis of exchange trading volume trends, CoinDesk have defined a new sixth startup ecosystem category, ‘universal’. The universal category was created for companies which house multiple areas of the bitcoin value chain under one roof.  While a number of companies have expressed an interest in operating as a universal (eg Safello) CoinDesk at present sees only two companies – Coinbase and Circle – as having both the products, roadmap and means to execute a universal business model.  Both Coinbase and Circle have disclosed raising more money than any of the other bitcoin startups. The two universals have raised a combined amount ($56m) which is greater than any other startup ecosystem category to date (Chart 4).  Chart 4: Investment Distribution Across Bitcoin Startup Ecosystem – all time  Are the current projections for the total investment in bitcoin startups in 2014 conservative or wildly optimistic? Will most bitcoin companies eventually seek to become or merge into a ‘universal’, or will pure plays be stronger over the long-term? Share your thoughts in the comments below.

42377087,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6xkfX,1396354715,Federal Bank VP: Bitcoin Threat Means Banks Must 'Adapt or Die',"On 31st March, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis – one of the 12 Federal Reserve banks – held a talk on bitcoin from a banking and economic viewpoint.  The session, entitled 'Bitcoin and Beyond: The Possibilities and the Pitfalls of Virtual Currencies', was presented by economist David Andolfatto, who is Vice President at the bank and a professor at Simon Fraser University.  Andolfatto offered some interesting insight into bitcoin from his perspective. Many aspects of the talk were positive about the digital currency, some were more negative, and overall the session was quite balanced.  At points, Andolfatto even seemed fascinated with the concept of bitcoin:  ""What do we have here? A stroke of genius, I think.""  Bitcoin through a banker's eyes  To begin with, the 'Bitcoin and Beyond' session took newcomers to the concept of digital currencies through some of the basics. Explained Andolfatto:  ""Bitcoin is a set of rules written down as a computer program. The object here ultimately is to get the costs of transactions as low as sending an email.""  The economist talked about bitcoin's open source nature, saying that, ""it's not something set in stone, it is a living object, that evolves over time"". Furthermore, as bitcoin can be improved over time, so can the dollar.  Said Andolfatto: ""That's what we do at the Fed, we fix bugs, in a way.""  The dismal state of banking  In the sometimes candid talk, Andolfatto said it was no surprise that decentralized systems of money came along, because ""everybody hates banks, even I hate banks.""  The problem with banking is that it lacks innovation and many people don't have access to financial institutions, he said.  As an example of a common criticism of the banking system, the economist mentioned the costs of sending $100 from St. Louis to Vancouver, Canada. A bank charges $10, or 10% for that transaction. Said Andolfatto:  ""Even in well-developed economies, banks don't always work as well together as we'd like.""  Email, on the other hand, is simple and costs very little, if anything at all. Andolfatto believes that money transmission over the Internet should be the same way.  Is bitcoin money?  Bitcoin is a technology that competes with money. It has two central goals, according to Andolfatto:  ""The hope is to basically slay the inflation dragon. And to drive transactions costs down to zero. That's the vision.""  However, he argued that bitcoin isn't stable enough to be money.  ""Is bitcoin a good money?"" he asked. ""Good money should maintain a stable purchasing power over a short period of time.""  At this point, Andolfatto presented a series of graphs: one showing the stability of the USD, which the Fed targets an annual 2% inflation rate, compared to other currencies:  Another graph illustrated the volatility of bitcoin in relation to the US dollar:  Over the short term, Andolfatto argued, bitcoin is too volatile to be considered money. The value tomorrow could be much different than today, which creates uncertainty in bitcoin as a purchasing tool.  Payments innovation  Andolfatto believes that while bitcoin is not stable enough as a form of money, it has other properties that will spark innovation in banking.  Reducing friction in payments is where cryptocurrencies will force banks to evolve, he said:  ""I think that the Federal Reserve can compete with bitcoin as a currency. But not the payments portion.""  The Federal Reserve has been in existence for 100 years, and Andolfatto said that banks should not fear competition from bitcoin. However, they should see it as a sign that the times have changed:  ""Well-run central banks should welcome the emerging competition.""  Regulating the 'Hydra'  Not all central banks are well run, of course. Bitcoin regulations that will eventually be introduced in different countries all over the world will force many central bankers to reveal how confident they are in their money systems.  That's because trying to control distributed systems like bitcoin will prove to be a very difficult task. The lack of a central bitcoin authority was likened by Andolfatto to the many-headed Lernaean Hydra in Greek mythology.  The legend told that, for each head of the Hydra that a warrior cut off, two more would grow back in its place. Said Andolfatto:  ""How do you regulate something that has no central head? It's like trying to slay the Hydra.""  Outlook  ""What's striking is the rapid price growth and the volatility"" in bitcoin, said Andolfatto. From an economic perspective, he said it's hard to determine whether bitcoin is really a good investment or not.  ""We have very good economic theory that asset prices are hard to forecast. How do you forecast these things?""  Belief in bitcoin, according to Andolfatto, will come down to trust in the system and whether or not investors are confident they will be able to exchange bitcoin for other stores of value.  He said:  ""Most assets are valued by how easily they can be liquidated. [Bitcoin investors] view it as a liquid instrument, that someone will accept it in exchange down the road.""  IRS Ruling  A recent IRS ruling indicated that bitcoin should be treated as property, and capital gains from buying and selling it must be accounted for in terms of tax reporting.  This regulatory guidance from the IRS is a way to make virtual currency adoption too expensive to use as real money. Said Andolfatto:  ""Compliance means added record-keeping costs.""  Protocols that zip money digitally around the globe derived from bitcoin, such as Ripple Labs, may be one benefactor in terms of the IRS's regulatory guidance:  ""Ripple is a currency-agnostic protocol. Ripple is the winner. It processes anything. It's quite possible this ruling benefits payment processors, rather than virtual currencies.""  'Adapt or die'  Andolfatto is sure that, ultimately, new systems will upend the monetary hierarchy of today – eventually forcing substantial changes within the banking and payments industry.  The future may be unclear for virtual currencies, but they should, in the long run, bring change:  ""The threat of entry into the money and payments system [...] forces traditional institutions to adapt or die.""

42377084,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6xkbl,1396347963,CEO of Bitcoin Officially Bans China,"Disclaimer: This article was posted as part of CoinDesk's April Fools' Day coverage.  Following rumours of China's plans to ban bank transfers to bitcoin exchanges, the CEO of Bitcoin™ has decided to ban China.  The decision was unanimously approved by Bitcoin's shareholders, the Bitcoin Board of Directors, HaCkerz4BITZ and the Bitcoin Steering Board.  As of 8th April, bitcoin transfers to and from the Glorious People's Republic of China will no longer by supported by the Bitcoin Network™. The decision will not affect the Republic of China (Taiwan) – unless it gets invaded in the meantime. It is unclear whether or not it will apply to Hong Kong, which is sort of part of China, but really it isn't – you know?  Pre-empting the PBOC ruling  The decision was announced by Bitcoin™ CEO Warren Winkleberg via reddit on Tuesday morning. It was made following extensive discussions with members of the bitcoin community, Chinese exchanges and Dorian S Nakamoto himself.  Although there were a few dissenting voices, they were drowned out in a lengthy discussion thanks to Godwin's Law – hence the decision was unanimous.  As a result, Bitcoin Inc.™ decided to pre-empt the imminent announcement of an official People's Bank of China (PBOC) notice, which is expected to effectively prohibit banks from doing business with bitcoin exchanges in mainland China, which happen to be wholly-owned subsidiaries of Bitcoin Inc.™  Warren Winkleberg stated:  ""In light of China's imminent decision to clamp down on bitcoin exchanges, we had no choice but to completely ban China. We are aware that the decision will have a long-term impact on the proliferation of bitcoin and the price, but frankly we had no alternative.""  ""We had to act in the best interest of our shareholders and Bitcoin™ investors worldwide,"" he added.  Reactions, backlash, counter-backlash reactions  CEO of The Internet™ Kal-El Al-Gore told CoinDesk that while the decision is controversial, in the grand scheme of things it will help the bitcoin community and The Internet™ as a whole. He added:  ""The Great Firewall of China has been hampering development and eating into our margins for more than a decade. Here at The Internet™ we know full well that restrictive policies advocated by certain circles in the Chinese government can have a devastating effect on growth and the adoption of new technologies. I should know, I invented The Internet™.""  ""In addition, carbon dioxide emissions caused by the firewall are contributing to China's air quality problems and they have become a public health issue. We all need to reduce our carbon footprint.""  CEO of Dogecoin™, Mr Shibah Inews said:  In addition, The Socialist Union of Bitcoin Miners warns that the decision will not do much to help the plight of Chinese bitcoin miners, who are often compelled to work in unregulated bitcoin mines under harsh conditions with no union protection.  The International Labour Organisation reports that more than a dozen canaries (bred for their 'bitcoin' yellow hue) died in Chinese bitcoin mines last year.  “Children are being forced to mine for blocks to add to the master block chain. However the difficulty is astronomical – these kids don’t even earn the transaction fees they’re mining for,” an investigator told bitcoin's premier news source The Coinion last December.  Even Apple has called for a thorough investigation from the authorities.  ""It is even worse than Foxconn. We did not believe it was humanly possible, but it is,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook tweeted in response. ""It is almost as inhumane as reading the iTunes terms of service.""  Price swings gone wild  The move is expected to cause even greater volatility on an already volatile bitcoin market. Many Chinese investors and exchanges are expected to start dumping their bitcoin holdings over the next week. This could trigger a ripple effect, causing many investors to unload their wallets before the price tanks.    Bit-o-coin price slide | Create Infographics    However, it is seen as an opportunity for speculators and even some governments. Ukraine is rumoured to be planning to acquire as much as $1bn worth of bitcoins, which it plans to use to pay off its $1.6bn gas bill and to irk Russia in the process.  Russian President Vladimir Putin is not impressed.  ""I bought into bitcoin at $14 and sold at $800. I'm all doge now,"" he said, adding: “In Putin's Russia, bitcoin exchanges you.""  Analysts expect the price to bottom out later this month, but before it does it will spend a couple of weeks in negative territory, literally.  It is not all bad news. Speculators can expect great returns if they pounce at the right moment. In related news, Mt. Gox is widely expected to miraculously ""find"" a few hundred thousand bitcoins once they are worth next to nothing.

42377079,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6xkVT,1396329445,Are the IRS Capital Asset Rules Realistic for Small Transactions?,"Does the IRS really want you to track your capital gains on bitcoin every time you buy a sandwich or a sweater in the digital currency?  After our analysis of the Internal Revenue Service guidelines on bitcoin, released in March, some people expressed surprise.  They were amazed that the IRS could seriously be applying capital gains rules to something that the bitcoin community sees as a currency, and which in many cases uses as such.  ""This can't be good for bitcoin"", said one commenter privately to Coindesk. ""If it’s not a currency, then how are you supposed to use it like one?""  But as far as the IRS is concerned, it isn't a currency – it's property, pure and simple. And the laws for tax on property are already pretty clearly defined.  When dealing in currencies, you declare the foreign losses and gains if you exchange them for another currency. But when you're dealing in property, then whenever you're trading it for something else, you declare the capital gains taxes that you have incurred.  This can be a good thing for investors who are in it for the longer term. They will end up having to pay long-term capital gains tax when exchanging their bitcoins for fiat currency, as long as they have held those bitcoins for longer than a year and a day. If they have held them for shorter than that, then they will pay short-term capital gains tax, which is the same as the ordinary income tax rate.  We double checked this with several people, including Keith A. Aqui, who wrote the IRS Notice. ""When you exchange property for other property, then you have to declare, because it's a capital asset,"" he confirmed.  We also spoke to another IRS spokesperson with the authority to speak about these matters. Said the staffer, who did not want to be named:  ""You're not a dealer, if you're a typical person, whether you call yourself an investor or not, that is essentially what you're going to be under the tax code. So if I have 10 bitcoins sitting around and I use them in a transaction and I realize a gain from the transaction compared to the original price, I will pay tax on that gain, as a capital gain.""  Richard Peterson, chair of Perkins Coie’s tax practice, also confirmed the interpretation, pointing to Q&A No.6 of the IRS Notice on the subject.  ""It makes clear that using the bitcoin as a payment triggers taxable income. The type of income would depend upon how the bitcoin was being held by the person making the purchase,"" he said.  ""If that person was an investor, the gain would still be capital gain, the same as if they had cashed in the bitcoin and then spent the cash at the retailer.""  The only way around this is if an an exception applies to make it ordinary, such as classifying the bitcoin as inventory. However, it would not be inventory in the hands of a consumer, he said.  This also has sticky connotations for firms wanting to pay bitcoins in wages or to buy services with it, confirmed another spokesperson for the IRS. He said:  ""There is a capital gains obligation there. It doesn't matter if you're holding them to pay someone's wages or not, any non-dealer has a tax obligation, if there are gains.""  It's already the law  Anyone questioning this further need only look to existing tax law, said Bryan Smith, a colleague of Peterson's and a partner with the firm's business practice. The IRS is simply applying it to virtual currency, he points out.  Said Smith:  ""Unless a specific exception applies, if you use any asset other than cash to make payments of any nature, you have taxable gain. The Notice doesn’t make this the law. It already is.”  In reality, though, it's going to be extremely hard to police that law. ""Most people want to be tax compliant, but at a certain point people will throw their hands in the air,"" said Tyson Cross, a tax attorney working in San Diego who specialises in advising people about bitcoin tax issues.  The concept of capital gains on tiny transactions is difficult to enforce, and enforcement is going down, not up. The IRS has released its latest statistics on the number of audits carried out. The overall audit rate in 2013 was 0.96%, which is the lowest since 2005.  Where it does audit people, it tends to go after big fish, with big transactions.  The highest percentage of people audited in 2013 with an income under $200,000 was the $0-$25,000 bracket. Of which 1% were nobbled.  Above $200,000, the rates keep rising, all the way up individuals with more than $10m in earnings on their tax returns for the year, where almost a quarter of people were audited.  Among this super-rich set, it will be presumably be looking for capital gains taxes on large property transactions (including large amounts of bitcoin).  The chances are that most bitcoiners using the digital currency (or property, depending on which government agency you're talking to) for daily transactions aren't going to be worrying too much about this in daily practice.  Nevertheless, if someone were to develop a mobile app with functionality built-in to track those capital gains taxes on bitcoin purchases, it might well appeal to a broad audience.  Would you use one?  Statements in this article should not be considered tax advice, which is best sought directly from a qualified professional.

His co-defendant in the case is 52-year-old Florida native Robert M. Faiella, also known as 'BTCKing'.  House arrest  Shrem has lived under house arrest at his parents' house in New York City on a $1m bond since his very public arrest in January. He was stopped at John F. Kennedy airport on his return to the US after speaking at a conference in Amsterdam.  Questions have been raised about the nature and timing of that arrest, and whether it was a publicity stunt to intimidate bitcoin businesses just before investigatory hearings by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) where Shrem was due to testify.  NYDFS Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky, who chaired the hearings, answered such questions by saying: ""Let me be clear on this. Absolutely not true.""  In interviews, Shrem has expressed bewilderment at his treatment and maintained he had been cooperating with authorities by answering any questions openly and honestly, providing information he expected would help authorities draft sensible regulations for digital currency, but which was ultimately used against him instead.

42377075,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6xkMf,1396319140,Mt. Gox Hearing Preview: Mark Karpeles Aims for Deposition in Taiwan,"UPDATE (22nd April 12:27 GMT): Article has been updated with the correct title for Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles.      The next hearing in the ongoing Chapter 15 US bankruptcy case involving troubled Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox is set to take place in a Dallas, Texas, courtroom today (1st April).  Although the hearing follows the release of more sensational news – such as a new Reuters report that suggests Mt. Gox may have mishandled client funds as far back as early 2012, Tuesday's court case will deal with more routine aspects of the proceedings.  At the hearing, Mt. Gox will reportedly seek to extend its US bankruptcy protection until the resolution of its Japanese bankruptcy filing, while US lawyers representing former exchange's users will try to obtain the court's approval to hold the deposition of CEO Mark Karpeles in the US.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Steven Woodrow, the lawyer heading the US class action case against Mt. Gox, indicated that Karpeles is attempting to block this motion – instead suggesting that the US legal team, as well as former exchange users, depose him in Taipei, Taiwan. Those who could not attend, Karpeles suggested, could follow along remotely via a video conference link.  A deposition is a form of preliminary testimony that allow both sides to learn the facts that will presented by a witness in the formal court case. It usually takes place out of court, but those under questioning must answer under oath.  Woodrow, a partner at the Edelson law firm in Denver, believes that Karpeles should be physically present in the US for the proceedings, though, especially because he has visited the country in the past – most recently to meet with his US legal team prior to its bankruptcy filing.  Perhaps more importantly, Woodrow explains that his clients are entitled to straightforward answers from the embattled CEO:    ""Really what this comes down to is a lack of transparency, there are things happening, bitcoins being moved, supposed proceedings that are occurring, other investigations that are ongoing and US creditors are at a real disadvantage.      They receive this information piecemeal in confusing ways and they don't know what to believe. Given that lack of transparency, we need to have Mr Karpeles come to the US to answer questions in a fluid way, not force everyone to fly around the globe to depose him through an interpreter.""    Should Karpeles not be willing to visit the US, Woodrow suggested that Karpeles, and by extension his Japan-based Mt. Gox entity, should not be entitled to the protection of the US courts.  Currently, there are three court cases pending against Mt. Gox in the US, its Chapter 15 bankruptcy filing, the US class action lawsuit as well as the still-unresolved dispute with former partner CoinLab.  Questions to answer  Though the Mt. Gox bankruptcy case has been proceeding for some time, Woodrow indicated that his team is still in the discovery process, and that bringing Karpeles to the US for questioning will help it obtain the information it needs for future aspects of the case.  For example, he said, this questioning will help resolve inconsistencies with how Mt. Gox has so far handled its filings.  Woodrow notes that in Mt. Gox K.K.'s Japanese bankruptcy filing, it wrote that its primary assets in the US consisted of accounts, while in the US filing, it indicated its assets amounted to only ""backup data on a server"".  Said Woodrow:  ""We're very interested in understanding where Mt. Gox's assets are in the US, and other information that's relevant to them coming here and saying, 'recognize our Japanese bankruptcy'.""  Recent case updates  Woodrow also discussed how recent events have impacted the case and clarified how his team will seek to involve Japan-based financial giant Mizuho in the proceedings. Mizuho was named a defendant in the case on 16th March, as it served as the exchange's banking partner.  Said Woodrow:  ""We view [Mizuho] in a little different light, as we told the Illinois court. We view them globally as an honest dealer, whereas we have strong reason to believe that Mt. Gox was more of a fraudulent enterprise.""  As such, he noted that his team will primarily seek to obtain information from Mizuho about its relationship with Mt. Gox.  Woodrow also touched on the recent Internal Revenue Service (IRS) decision to treat digital currencies as property, but noted that exactly how this could impact the case it unknown.  He added: ""It's something that class members are going to want to pay attention to.""  Fact-finding discussions  In addition to the question of where the deposition against Karpeles will be held, Woodrow indicated the hearing would also include unspecified scheduling discussions.  While seemingly small, a thorough examination of Karpeles at this stage could prove instrumental to the case.  Woodrow notes that his team is not allowed to seek information about Mt. Gox K.K. because the bankruptcy court has frozen all related proceedings, but that it is allowed to conduct fact-finding against Mt.
