18983763,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555752,1697583618,Meme Coins That Are Ripe For The Picking Following $3.2 Billion Crash,"As the crypto market suffered major losses due to the bear season, meme coins were not left out. These tokens which are often created in line with memes on the internet saw their cumulative market cap drop by $3.2 billion in 2023. This decline has paved the way for possibly buying these highly popular tokens at what could be considered a discount. Dogecoin (DOGE): King Of The Meme Coins Dogecoin (DOGE) has managed to retain its title as the king of the meme coins over the years but that has not helped the altcoin to dodge the bloodbath. Despite starting out the year 2023 strong and trading close to the $0.1 level, it has succumbed to the seemingly never-ending bear pressure and fallen around 50% since then. Related Reading: Cardano Whale Addresses Continue To Fall, What Does This Mean For ADA Price? Dogecoin is currently trading at one of its lowest points since the year began, which could signal a prime time for purchasing the meme coin. According to data from Messari, DOGE’s price is currently over 91% lower than its all-time high price of $0.738. This means that a return to its all-time high in a bull market would be an almost 10x return on investment from its current $0.059 level. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The DOGE Killer When Shiba Inu first came out in 2020 as an alleged ‘Dogecoin killer’, crypto investors did not take it seriously. It wasn’t until it mounted one of the most impressive rallies of 2021 that investors saw its potential. Eventually, it grew to become the second-largest crypto among the meme coins, clocking an over $10 billion market cap at one point. However, just like its biggest competitor Dogecoin, Shiba Inu has been subject to unfavorable conditions which have seen its price decline rapidly. It is almost 92% below its October 2021 all-time high of $0.0000869. So just like Dogecoin, a return to its all-time high price will also see SHIB return almost 10x on its current price of $0.00000706. SHIB price losses $0.000007 support | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com SHIB also remains a fierce competition for Dogecoin after the team released their very own Layer 2 blockchain called Shibarium. This blockchain, built atop the Ethereum network, has put it in the league of large players such as Polygon (MATIC), Arbitrum (ARB), and Optimism (OP). Pepe Coin (PEPE): The New Kid On The Block Pepe Coin (PEPE) is currently only a few months old but it has already shown that it deserves to be listed among the top meme coins. PEPE’s run-up to over $1.4 billion in a bear market was nothing short of historical. But even this new kid on the block could not completely shake off the bears. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Says Ethereum Price Can Reach $35,000, Here’s When PEPE’s market cap has fallen by over $1.2 billion since it hit its all-time high in May, which could present a buying opportunity. Now, given PEPE’s performance in a bear market, it is expected to rally even more in a bull market. Since it is currently 84% below its all-time high price, a return to that level from here would mean an 8x return. The coin also commands a significant following with 520,000 followers on Twitter, making it one of the most followed meme coins in the space.

He even had one soiree at New York City Mayor Eric Adams’ favorite late-night haunt.  Despite living in the Bahamas, the erstwhile crypto titan frequented the Big Apple in 2022, according to testimony at Bankman-Fried’s trial from an FBI agent who specializes in analyzing phone records. On Tuesday, Special Agent Richard Busick walked the jury through a series of meetups. This part of his testimony was likely meant to highlight how Bankman-Fried’s alleged crimes played out in New York City.  At one moment Bankman-Fried might show up for a 15-minute photoshoot with Forbes in midtown; at another, he’d be penciled in with Saudi Arabia’s finance minister, Khalid A. Al-Falih or the head of its sovereign wealth fund, Yasir Al-Rumayyan. All scheduling streamed through his employee Natalie Tien, a personal assistant whose experiences managing the frazzled CEO provide the opening scenes in Michael Lewis’ book “Going Infinite.”  In March 2022, Bankman-Fried even took a dinner with Mayor Adams at Osteria La Baia, an Italian restaurant near the Museum of Modern Art that’s owned by friends of Hizzoner and has become his de-facto after-hours office. A copy of the mayor’s public schedule has a “Hold for Mayor” meeting on March 3, 2022, starting at 8:30 p.m. ET, but does not include details of who he met with. In September 2022 Bankman-Fried was slated to meet New York Governor Kathy Hochul at The Capital Grille steakhouse – an odd meeting ground for the avowed vegan.  Read all of CoinDesk’s SBF trial coverage here.  The emails prosecutors selected showcased how in-demand Bankman-Fried was prior to everything falling apart. The investing world clamored for access to the crypto wunderkind; 32 different funds requested access to a group dinner, including that of George Soros and Morgan Stanley.

BTC's market share of all cryptos rose to 52%, its highest since April 2021.  Bitcoin still has ""the upper hand"" among digital assets due to a potential spot BTC ETF approval and next year's halving event, ByteTree analysts said.  Bitcoin [BTC] continued to outperform the cryptocurrency market as Ethereum's ether [ETH] and decentralized finance, or DeFi, tokens slid Tuesday.  BTC, the largest digital asset by market cap, sunk to $28,100 early during the day before rising to near $28,500, slightly up over the past 24 hours.  Meanwhile, ETH showed weakness and dropped 1.8% to near $1,560 over the same period, marking a fresh 15-month low price relative to BTC. The broader digital asset market proxy, the CoinDesk Market Index, was slightly down by 0.6%.  Among crypto sectors, the CoinDesk DeFi Index (DCF) struggled the most during the day with its 3.7% decline, led by decentralized exchange UniSwap's native token [UNI] tumbling almost 7% after Uniswap Labs said it will impose a 0.15% fee on some trades executed via its front end starting Tuesday.

In an X post on October 17, Matty Taylor, the Head of Growth at the Solana Foundation, said there were far more developers from China who submitted applications, willing to participate in the Solana Hyperdrive hackathon than from the United States. Solana Attracting Chinese Developers The hackathon has a prize pool of $1 million, and all submissions had to be submitted by October 15. It is an online event aiming to “nurture and expand” the Solana ecosystem. Developers from 68 countries submitted, with the highest numbers coming from China and Vietnam. The rest were mainly from the United States, India, Mexico, Turkey, and Germany. That notable participation from Chinese developers can be a massive boost for Solana, indicating that the blockchain could be popular in the Asian economic powerhouse. China remains pro-blockchain and believes that the technology can give them an edge and even improve efficiency in some critical sectors, like agriculture, healthcare, governance, and finance, that the country seeks to enhance gradually.

However, China has banned crypto trading and mining, citing the “need to go green, protect consumers, and ensure financial stability.” The Chinese central bank, PBoC, said cryptocurrencies could pose a risk to the country’s financial system. Unlike Ethereum, Solana permits fast transaction processing and is relatively scalable with decent activity. Although the project suffered following the collapse of FTX in November 2022, there has been a revival in price and on-chain activity. The Revival, Will SOL Breach $30?

42409567,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcKgPZ,1697578502,Bahamian Prime Minister Asked Sam Bankman-Fried to Give His Son Advice on NFT Project,"NEW YORK – Two months before Sam Bankman-Fried’s empire collapsed, Bahamian Prime Minister Philip Davis asked the crypto mogul to speak with the politician’s son about an NFT project he was consulting for, according to an email presented Tuesday as evidence by prosecutors.  The premier’s September 2022 request to Bankman-Fried underscores the cozy relationship he enjoyed with officials in the Bahamas, where the FTX exchange was based. The government has faced criticism for being too lax in its regulation of crypto companies.  Earlier this year, the island nation began a consultation period for a tighter set of rules to ensure digital-asset exchanges have safeguards ""adequate and appropriate for the scale and nature"" of their businesses, the Securities Commission of the Bahamas said in April. And Davis recently said the Bahamas is ""committed to developing an effective and stable regulatory framework,"" Forkast reported this month.  While questioning FBI agent Richard Busik to clarify why Bankman-Fried is facing wire fraud charges, U.S. Attorney Danielle Kudla presented an email from September 2022 to verify the phone number used by Busik in his examinations indeed belonged to Bankman-Fried.  The message, sent from a Gmail address, included an email signature with the contact information of Philip Davis, who was then and remains prime minister of the Bahamas. Davis asked Bankman-Fried if his son could call the FTX CEO to talk about an NFT project that the son was working on. In response, Bankman-Fried sent his phone number and said he’d be available via phone or Zoom, the email showed.  A spokesperson for Davis could not be reached by press time.

While generating buzz and curiosity, this decision has raised several questions regarding its impact on traders. Decentralized exchanges (DEX) facilitate peer-to-peer trading without intermediaries. The absence of centralized entities has advantages but also presents challenges, especially regarding fee structures. Uniswap’s latest update to alter its fee structure is a significant shift with potential implications for its large user base. Related Reading: Uniswap V4 Expected To Be Huge, But Is This Requirement A Dealbreaker? Uniswap Fee Structure: Analyzing The Financial Impact According to data shared by Colin Wu, a blockchain-focused reporter, the daily fees from this change on Uniswap V3 could range between $388,000 and $444,000. Providing deeper insight into the platform’s operations, Wu mentions that approximately 35% to 40% of the entire transaction volume on Uniswap occurs on the front end. These figures, while substantial, are just the tip of the iceberg. Specific tokens targeted for this new fee include popular tokens such as ETH, USDC, WETH, USDT, DAI, WBTC, agEUR, GUSD, LUSD, EUROC, and XSGD. However, according to the Chinese reporter, this fee will only apply when these tokens are traded through Uniswap Labs interfaces on the mainnet and its supported Layer 2 networks. Currently, about 35%-40% of the transaction volume in Uniswap is completed through front end, H/T @1kbeetlejuice. Ethereum Uniswap V3 in the past 24h is $810m, excluding major stablecoin pairs, which is $740m, the daily fees charged by V3 may be $388k-444k.… https://t.co/EAeV6xwQHX — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 17, 2023 Understanding The Broader Context While the announcement sparked curiosity, it also led to some confusion concerning the fees. Uniswap’s help center, in response, clarified that these newly implemented fees stand apart from the Uniswap Protocol fee switch, which is determined through votes by Uniswap’s governance mechanism. Despite the explanation by the DEX’s team, the genesis of this new fee introduction remains ambiguous to many within the community. In response to Wu’s initial post, several individuals opposed the update, with a particular user questioning the rationale behind the 0.15% fee, the considerations leading to this specific percentage, and the selection of particular tokens for the fee imposition. According to data from Coinmarketcap, Uniswap has reported a significant trading volume of $518.3 million in the past 24 hours, capturing 18.3% of the market share within the decentralized exchange sector.

GBTC has traded at a discount since February 2021 and reached a record low of nearly 50% in December last year during the prolonged crypto winter. The company said on Monday it is “operationally ready” to convert GBTC into an ETF upon the SEC’s approval.  The narrowing comes as Grayscale awaits a decision from the U.S. Securities and Commission Exchange on whether it can convert the fund into an ETF. On Friday, the SEC failed to appeal its August court loss over Grayscale’s application to convert GBTC into a spot ETF, igniting some hope among investors that the SEC might approve the application.

Bitcoin Could See A 165% Rise When The Spot ETFs Launch Yesterday, fake news of the approved iShares Bitcoin spot ETF took the sector by storm, as all cryptocurrencies observed sharp rallies. At the peak of this surge, BTC had approached the $30,000 level. However, when the market realized the truth about the announcement, the asset quickly retraced to the levels it was at before the rally. While the gains were only brief, the rally nonetheless provided a glimpse into the strong reaction that the market could see to the launch of a real ETF. This was just one spot ETF; however, several others are waiting in line to be approved. How would the market look like when all these ETFs have launched? In its new report, the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has discussed precisely that. The assets under management of the various companies waiting for ETF approval | Source: CryptoQuant The above table shows information about the various companies waiting to be approved for the Bitcoin spot ETF, including the total size of their assets under management (AUM). Related Reading: Chainlink Whales Moved Around $150M In LINK Before Latest Surge: Data “Although these ETFs are not expected to be approved this year, the probability that they will be approved by the final deadline (March 2024) has been growing as a result of favorable court rulings for Grayscale (GBTC Fund) and XRP in their respective legal fight against the SEC,” says the firm. In total, these companies’ AUM are around $15.6 trillion. If they put just 1% of this amount towards BTC, it would mean inflows of a whopping $155 billion for the asset. “To put it in context, these amounts represent almost a third of the current market capitalization of Bitcoin,” notes CryptoQuant. Now, how this capital inflow could affect the market cap of BTC isn’t exactly simple to say. Generally, the market cap increases by more than just the raw capital entering the cryptocurrency. The firm has used the “realized cap” metric to assess this relationship. The realized cap is a capitalization method for BTC that calculates its total value by assuming that the value of each coin is the same as the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. The realized cap can be imagined as the total investment made by the investors, accounting for the prices at which each bought their coins. The chart below shows how this realized cap has compared with the market over the years. The comparison between the trends of the realized cap and market cap | Source: CryptoQuant The graph shows that the market cap and realized cap usually have noticeably different growth rates, as they have always followed pretty different paths. CryptoQuant has calculated the ratio between the annual growths of the two caps and has found that for most of the asset’s history, the market cap has grown by 3 to 6 times faster than the realized cap. Related Reading: Analyst Points Out Weird Bitcoin Activity On Bybit & Deribit Before Flash Surge If the realized cap grows by $155 billion when the spot ETFs get approved and the asset managers allot 1% of their AUM to Bitcoin, the market cap could grow by between $450 and $900 billion. The report notes this figure implies “the market cap would increase between 82% and 165% from the current level and that Bitcoin price could reach between $50K and $73K as a result of these inflows of fresh money.” BTC Price Bitcoin has enjoyed some uptrend over the past few days as the asset has now climbed above the $28,500 level.

42409571,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcKgjP,1697572019,Why Power Is Passing to Courts to Make US Crypto Policy,"Regulating new technologies has never been easy, but it is especially difficult in the modern era. The U.S. legal system faces an unprecedented challenge due to emerging blockchain and AI technology. Should the U.S. legal system fail to manage these changes effectively, the next decade of technology innovation may bypass the U.S. for brighter shores.  Michele Benedetto Neitz is a Visiting Professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law and the Founder & Academic Director at the Blockchain Law for Social Good Center. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s “State of Crypto” Week, sponsored by Chainalysis.  The front line for creating laws for new technology law today is not Congress. State legislatures, state agencies and judges in state and federal courts are taking the lead. This fragmented approach to rulemaking is the result of three legal trends: Congressional inaction, the decline and potential fall of the Chevron doctrine (see below), and regulation by enforcement. Combined, these three forces are converging to shift the balance of power to courts and states in a way we have not yet experienced in the U.S.  Why should non-lawyers care?  The consequence of this power shift has been readily apparent in the regulation of the decentralized technology industry. The industry struggles to comply with a patchwork of judicial decisions across jurisdictions and varying state laws and regulation. But this challenge will not be unique to blockchain – it’s just the beginning. Other newly developing industries, such as artificial intelligence, could battle the same issues. Consequently, until federal leadership emerges, the pressure will be on judges and state actors.  Trend one: Congressional Inaction  Recent legislative proposals in the U.S. Congress indicate an intent to get federal legislators and agencies “caught up” with emerging technology developments. However, the failure of Congress to create a cohesive legislative framework for decentralized technologies and artificial intelligence leaves a large regulatory gap.  By mid-summer 2023, all eyes were on courts — not Congress and not federal executive agencies — to make decisions on important legal issues related to digital assets. While Congress sits on the sidelines, increasingly bold state legislatures are regulating blockchain and digital asset companies in accordance with their respective state policies. In the proverbial laboratories of democracy, state policy viewpoints often differ from those held by other states and federal agencies. The result is fragmentation, increased costs of doing business and less consumer protection.  Trend two: Decline of the Chevron Doctrine  Courts generally defer to the expertise of agency determinations. This doctrine of “judicial deference” to federal agencies is rooted in the Supreme Court’s 1984 decision in Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. However, the Supreme Court is signaling that the Chevron deference era may be coming to an end.  The Court granted certiorari in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo in 2023 to explicitly consider whether to overturn the Chevron doctrine. This means that judges may soon create binding precedent without the need to defer to agency expertise. Practically speaking, we are likely to observe even more fragmentation as a result – this time among the courts. Decisions will likely differ between jurisdictions, leading to a wide variety of conflicting rulings regarding important legal and policy issues. Thus, if the Chevron doctrine does indeed fall, courts will be more powerful but legal compliance will be more difficult.  Trend three: Regulation by enforcement  The third legal development giving rise to judicial and state power is the recent trend of agencies to pursue “regulation by enforcement.” Agencies are increasingly turning to courts to establish policies, rather than using the notice-and-comment procedures of the rulemaking process. Professors Chris Brummer, Yesha Yadav, and David Zaring outlined this issue well in a forthcoming article. This trend is especially notable in the context of digital assets and securities regulation. The SEC has been criticized by its own commissioners for its enforcement-heavy approach to regulation. Ironically, agencies appear to be increasingly abdicating their own authority. If the matters don’t settle, the SEC is turning to judges to make decisions on important legal issues.  Where do we go from here?  State and federal judges, state agencies, and state legislatures (and their staff) should be prepared to make consequential decisions on legal issues regarding emerging technologies.  First, state legislators should allocate more funds for training themselves and state agencies about the nuances of decentralized technologies and AI. The National Association of Attorneys General has been training their members for years on technology issues. In one of these trainings, the author queried AGs, deputies, and their staff about their “biggest concern” around digital assets. Three-quarters stated that “consumer fraud” was their #1 concern, meaning more cases are clearly going to be filed in courts. Judges should therefore push for increased funds to ensure up-to-date trainings, before emerging technology cases appear on their docket.  Law schools also play an important role in educating lawmakers and decisionmakers. Schools often host conferences and can offer interdisciplinary trainings. Judges and state policymakers should be permitted to audit classes on these topics. In addition, law professors can serve on state task forces, working groups, and other volunteer positions to educate government officials.  Second, building on the concept of a “Chief AI officer” in federal agencies, judges and state actors should prioritize the hiring of unbiased computer scientists and technical experts as advisers. TechCongress, a nonprofit based in Washington D.C., embeds “Tech Fellows” in Senate offices for year-long fellowships to bring technical expertise to senators and their staff. These types of roles should be permanent installations in judicial chambers, statehouses, and state agency offices.  Third, federal, state, and local governments should eliminate the silos that exist between them and cultivate a broader learning community. For example, federal legislators gathering input from stakeholders should incorporate perspectives, education, and counsel from the smaller tech organizations and nonprofits driving impact at a local or state level. In this way, lawmaking related to new technologies would include more diverse views than those with the loudest voices (and the deepest pockets) in the room.  The legal system faces one of its biggest challenges ever, as advances in technology threaten to subsume the courts and state actors with technical issues they are not currently prepared to address. For the U.S. to continue to serve as a leader, the legal system must manage this power shift effectively and create clear, consistent rules.  How? Courts and state officials should prepare for this new era through improved tech education and trainings, integrating technical experts into their offices, and eliminating silos that limit the number of voices heard as laws are being made.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Michele Benedetto Neitz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/17/why-power-is-passing-to-courts-to-make-us-crypto-policy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e5a4a36a9b0768a532fb184f863424cb9b107382-7952x4473.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While investors are still wondering about the short-term outlook of the crypto, a Shiba Inu whale has gone ahead to move $32.4 million in SHIB tokens into an unknown wallet. Whale Moves $32.4 Million Shiba Inu This whale transfer appears to have generated interest from SHIB investors, considering the relatively quiet environment within the Shiba Inu ecosystem.

The recipient wallet “0x44a8” now holds a total of over 4.58 trillion SHIB, worth more than $33 million at the time of writing. Address “0xe9bb” had initially received the tokens from “0xA863” before transferring it out to “0x44a8” in less than 10 minutes. SHIB price trending at $0.000007 | Source: SHIBUSDT on Tradingview.com Large Sell Incoming? This whale transfer is one of the largest SHIB transactions this month. But while whale movements tend to reveal the current market sentiment, a single transfer cannot necessarily move the entire market, even if there’s a selloff. As a result, Shiba Inu’s price hasn’t reacted much to the transfer but has lost 0.29% of its market cap in the past 24 hours. Although there’s always a possibility of the whale dumping their entire bag, this trading behavior suggests they intend to keep holding the tokens.

42409588,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcKfpC,1697568454,"Why Binance, Coinbase, Ripple and Other Crypto Firms Cite the ‘Major Questions’ Doctrine During Legal Imbroglios","Binance has “major questions.” Coinbase has “major questions.” Even President Joseph Biden had major questions. What exactly are these “major questions” that keep popping up across the crypto industry, and is it a “legal meme, ”like some people have suggested?  This article is part of CoinDesk's State of Crypto Week, sponsored by Chainalysis.  To make short work of it, the so-called “major questions doctrine” is a recently established legal precedent that is meant to curb government overreach. In particular, it’s the administrative theory that Congress writes the rules that agencies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are meant to follow.  What that also means is that federal agencies are not supposed to wantonly assert “statutory authority” over uncertain domains — e.g. SEC Chair Gary Gensler stating “all of crypto” falls under his agency's remit — without explicit permission. U.S. courts have the ability to determine when such agencies have overstepped.  In other words, “Congress makes the laws and [the SEC] follows their lead. Congress makes laws and [the SEC] interprets and enforces them,” as Ron Hammond, tktk of the Blockchain Association, said. The doctrine is less of a law, and more of a legal framework used to interpret the law.  Given that industry participants have been calling for a clear regulatory framework for years, it makes sense that “major questions” arise in the context of crypto. Binance’s U.S. affiliate, for instance, has evoked the doctrine in an attempt to quash an SEC lawsuit that claims the exchange sold unregistered securities.  ""The SEC recently brought several enforcement actions – including this action – premised on its new position that virtually all crypto assets, and virtually all cryptoasset transactions, are securities,"" a document filed in September reads.  See also: Could Sam Bankman-Fried's Saga Happen Without Crypto? | Opinion  “Indeed, since 2019, Congress has considered more than a dozen proposals that would provide a coherent and workable framework for crypto assets and their trading platforms,"" the filing said. ""Critically, none of those proposals would confer sole regulatory jurisdiction over the crypto industry to the SEC,” it continued.  Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto business, is arguing along the same lines. Like Binance, Coinbase argued that the SEC doesn’t have explicit permission to say whether it is an unlicensed securities exchange, and cited the “major questions” doctrine in a brief meant to quickly expel the SEC’s lawsuit.  Last week, the SEC fired back against Coinbase’s brief in what has been called both its “most expansive response to date to crypto industry arguments” the agency is exceeding its bounds and also something of a “novel” interpretation of the rules. In an Oct. 4 filing, the SEC argued “major questions” is nullified in that it has never been applied to a matter of “enforcement authority.”  Further, in a novel interpretation that has ruffled some feathers, the SEC said thus far the “major questions” doctrine has only applied to strike down “novel regulatory forays,” and most significantly, novel regulatory forays into areas of major “economic and political significance.” Coinbase, the SEC said, “does not have the vast economic or political significance.”  The reason the “major questions” defense is so disputed goes back to its history, and how the doctrine has been applied over the years. Major questions as a legal theory made an entrance, many jurists claim, in a 2000 Supreme Court decision barring the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a federal executive agency, from imposing new rules around tobacco advertisements.  More to the point of the SEC’s case, in 2023, a New Hampshire court refused to apply the “major questions” doctrine to throw out FinCEN’s lawsuit of a man accused of several criiminal offenses in connection to operating a bitcoin services business. Ian Freeman, a libertarian activist and radio shock jock, was recently sentenced to eight years in prison for operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and conspiracy charges, after a judge discounted the idea that an earlier ruling defanged the Bank Secrecy Act, which was used to convict him.  “FinCEN's interpretation is consistent with the clear statement of regulatory authority Congress granted it and thus does not run afoul of the major questions doctrine,” District Judge Joseph N. Laplante wrote. Moreover, FinCEN’s indictment did not “seek to regulate” a significant economic activity and did not “seek to intrude” on a matter of state law. Bitcoins, too, can consider “funds” in the context of an unlicensed money transmitting business, Laplante said.  Freeman intends to appeal the decision, which could help clarify the matter. His major legal argument, which again is in uncharted territory, is that the Supreme Court's decision last year in West Virginia v. EPA “changed the legal landscape” by essentially disempowering federal agencies, so that FinCEN's 2013 interpretive guidance on “virtual currency” should be invalidated.  Indeed, when the Environmental Protection Agency lost its case over an attempt to restrict greenhouse gas emissions in West Virginia, in late 2022, many legal theorists thought this could have a widespread effect on how federal agencies regulate. Though it is unlikely this wipes the slate clean on executive guidance and rulemaking, or the tools watchdogs use to set boundaries in lieu of actual laws passed by Congress.  “Major questions” has a “narrow” interpretation and a “broad” one, but both are essentially about determining how agencies like the SEC can apply the legal authority already granted to them.  The doctrine was first applied to the crypto industry by Ripple Labs and supporters who filed “amicus briefs” defending the crypto firm against the SEC’s charges of securities infractions. In a particularly prescient “friend-of-the-court” filing, Paradigm stated the SEC broadly has authority to regulate the issuance of cryptocurrencies like XRP, but not the ability to police “the secondary market” (i.e. peer-to-peer sales or retail purchases of XRP on exchanges), which more or less matched the judge’s ultimate interpretation.  See also: Ripple's XRP Ruling Does Nothing for Regulatory Clarity | Opinion  One last point, circling back to crypto’s economic importance. Terraform Labs, the entity that built the doomed UST stablecoin, recently has a key legal defense maneuver preempted after a judge determined the “crypto sector as a whole” is not valuable enough to get protection from the “major questions” doctrine.  There’s some irony here, in that UST’s implosion led to widespread industry contagion that helped knocked the crypto market down from an over $2 trillion capitalization.

18973083,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555768,1697565602,Time To Cash Out? Bitcoin’s 4-Hour RSI Triggers Sell Indicator,"Bitcoin (BTC) has retraced to the $28,400 level following a failed breakout above $30,000, resulting in a high rate of liquidations for both long and short positions. Additionally, the recent fake news surrounding the approval of Blackrock’s spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission has disrupted the upward trend and introduced new bearish indicators in the Bitcoin market. RSI Screams Sell Renowned trader and crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggests selling BTC based on its 4-hour chart Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator. His simple trading strategy advises selling BTC when the RSI exceeds 74.21 and buying when the RSI dips below 30.35. As seen in the chart above, BTC’s RSI stands at the 74 level, which is notably high considering that on October 16, after the spread of the fake news on various platforms, including X (Formerly Twitter), the RSI reached as high as 82.83. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price: Why $28,000 Could Hold The Key For Massive Bull Run While this indicator may seem straightforward, it has proven effective on BTC’s 4-hour chart. For instance, on October 1st, Bitcoin peaked at $28,500, but after the RSI climbed above 80, the leading cryptocurrency swiftly dropped to $27,150 within hours. Although the effectiveness of these indicators is not always guaranteed, the combination of the recent false pump, the ongoing retrace evident in all BTC charts, the lack of bullish momentum, and the prevailing market sentiment of fear, doubt, and uncertainty could create the perfect storm for BTC to retest lower support levels before potentially embarking on another upward movement. Bitcoin Pre-Halving Retracements Sound Alarm Bells To further support Ali Martinez’s bearish thesis, renowned crypto analyst Rekt Capital recently shed light on Bitcoin’s historical retracements approximately 180 days before halving events. According to Rekt, in 2015/2016, approximately 180 days before the halving, Bitcoin experienced a retracement of -25%. Similarly, in 2019, around the same timeframe before the halving, Bitcoin retraced by -38%. While Rekt Capital identifies as a macro bull, he acknowledges that historical data favors bearish trends before halving events. Related Reading: Leading Video Game Company Embraces XRP As Price Faces Key Resistance This observation raises the question of whether history will repeat itself in 2023. Will Bitcoin witness a significant retracement similar to previous cycles, or will the market dynamics 2023 deviate from historical patterns? What is certain is that as the crypto community eagerly anticipates the 2023 halving, uncertainty looms regarding Bitcoin’s price behavior leading up to the event. As of the current market conditions, BTC is trading at $28,400, indicating a profitable position across all time frames. In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has experienced a modest increase of 1%. Over the seven, fourteen, and thirty-day periods, BTC has recorded profits of 3.7%, 4%, and 7%, respectively, despite the earlier bearish factors. The sustainability of Bitcoin’s current price level remains uncertain, as it remains to be seen whether it will withstand potential retracements soon.

In the month of October, the digital asset suffered a 10% drop, plummeting from $4.3 to $3.6. Market analysts are warning of the potential for further losses should the prevailing bearish pressure persist. However, a slight glimmer of hope emerged as DOT attempted a reversal at $3.6, hinting at the possibility of overcoming the overhead resistance barrier. Related Reading: XRP On The Cusp Of Redemption? Unveiling Data-Backed Insights At present, the DOT price according to CoinGecko stands at $3.74, depicting a marginal 0.3% decline over the last 24 hours and a 2.8% dip over the span of seven days. DOT’s Struggle For Recovery The absence of horizontal support below the current price underscores the significance of Fib retracement levels in forecasting potential bottoming areas. Notably, a Fibonacci retracement tool was utilized, encompassing the lower high of $4.8 on August 29 and the recent dip of $3.6 on October 12. This analysis highlighted that the path to recovery for DOT faces significant obstacles at the 23.6% Fib ($3.9) and the 38.2% Fib ($4). Complicating matters further, the $4 level, serving as the second resistance target, coincides with a daily bearish order block (OB). This confluence suggests that crossing the $3.9 threshold could prove challenging for bullish momentum. Polkadot Developers Stand Strong Despite the persistent price downturn, the developers within the Polkadot ecosystem remain resolute and undeterred. This unwavering commitment is evident from the substantial Polkadot active developers, which are currently hovering close to an all-time high. This figure notably exceeds the levels recorded in 2021 when the altcoin’s price reached its peak. Total crypto market cap is currently at $1.06 trillion.

The document will now be published in the EU's Official Journal and enter into force 20 days later.  The rules were proposed last year in a bid to block assets from being stashed overseas using crypto and had unanimous support from EU member states despite discussions mostly taking place largely behind closed doors.

Crypto is currently undergoing a maturation phase and increasingly integrating with existing financial plumbing.  Regulatory restrictions and lack of standards pose challenges for widespread tokenization.  The market for tokenized assets could grow to as large as $10 trillion in this decade as traditional financial (TradFi) institutions continue to adopt blockchain technology, digital asset management firm 21.co said in a report.  ""The convergence between crypto and traditional asset classes, including fiat currencies, equities, government bonds, and real estate, is experiencing an unprecedented growth,"" read the report. ""We estimate that the market value for tokenized assets will be between $3.5 trillion in the bear-case scenario and $10 trillion in the bull case by 2030.""  21.co's forecast joins a slew of recent reports and predictions about the potential of tokenizing real-world assets (RWA), crypto's buzzword for placing traditional financial products such as private equity, debt and real estate to blockchain rails.

Bitcoin ETF Could Be Near,"Summary Grayscale Bitcoin Trust surges after SEC does not appeal court ruling on ETF application denial. ETF approval could lead to institutional money flooding into GBTC and narrowing the discount to NAV. Bitcoin's volatility and lack of liquidity highlight the need for an ETF approval to establish a more liquid market. Thesis Summary Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) was up big on October 16, following news on October 13 that the SEC would not appeal a court ruling that said the SEC had arbitrarily denied Grayscale’s ETF application. This potentially paves the way for the ETF to be approved, which in turn paves the way for a flood of institutional money. Over the past few months, the GBTC discount has narrowed. However, there’s still around a 16% discount, and for this reason, GBTC could continue to outperform Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). But what happens if and when the ETF does get approved? This could turn into a sell-the-news event, as Bitcoin will no longer have the looming catalyst of the ETF approval. SEC does Not Fight the Ruling Friday was the deadline for the SEC to appeal the court ruling that found it had arbitrarily rejected Grayscale’s ETF application. The latest ETF application was rejected on the grounds that Grayscale could not protect investors from market manipulations. This led GBTC to sue the SEC, making the point that the SEC had already approved Bitcoin futures after certain surveillance measures were put in place. Both futures and a Spot ETF rely on Bitcoin’s price, so how come the market is “safe enough” for futures trading but not for an ETF? Well, the court listened and in fact, sided with Grayscale, saying that the SEC had arbitrarily denied their application. The SEC has not appealed this decision. So what happens next? The court is expected to issue a ruling specifying what happens next, but most likely, it will mean that the SEC will have to revisit Grayscale’s application. This doesn’t mean that an ETF will definitely be approved, but, at the very least, the SEC will have to find a more legitimate reason to turn down the application. Institutions waiting on the sidelines Of course, there are two important factors to consider here when it comes to GBTC and Bitcoin. Firstly, an approval of the ETF would serve to close GBTC’s current discount to NAV. GBTC discount (YCharts) GBTC still trades at a discount to its intrinsic value. In other words, the value of its Bitcoin is higher than the current share price reflects. A spot ETF would introduce a mechanism for the fund to arbitrage this discount, which would serve to eliminate it. As we can see, the discount has already been narrowing, perhaps in anticipation of the ETF approval. The discount, which once reached almost 40% has now narrowed to 15%. On top of that, an ETF approval would serve to capture a much larger chunk of institutional and retail traders. This increasing interest can actually be seen in the recent flow data: According to data released on Monday, digital asset investment products have seen consistent inflows of $15 million for three weeks straight, even though trading volumes are currently 27% below the 2023 average. Source: Investing.com This data also points out an interesting dichotomy, which is that while flows are up, volumes are down, and this is actually having some strong repercussions in the market. Bitcoin Volatility Bitcoin has been incredibly volatile over the last few months. If we look at the chart, we see long periods of “inactivity”, where price remains almost flat, and then big moves up, like the one we are seeing today. This shows that the current market lacks liquidity. It seems like a bit of volume is greatly affecting the price. This recent surge is evidence of that. In fact, after a post on X, falsely claimed that the BTC ETF had been approved, we saw a big and short-lived spike to $30,000 Bitcoin (BTC) surged from $27,900 to $30,000 after a false report of a spot ETF approval was posted on social app X, formerly Twitter, leading to nearly $100 million in liquidations in the past hour. Source: CoinDesk These wild moves and liquidations are not great, in my opinion. Bitcoin needs to establish itself as a liquid market, and my plans are that an ETF approval will also contribute to this, GBTC vs. BTC Since Bitcoin bottomed in late 2022, GBTC has actually outperformed Bitcoin by quite a margin. GBTC v BTC (TradingView) GBTC is up over 150%, while Bitcoin is “only” up 59%. This can be attributed to the narrowing of the discount. As I mentioned before, the discount is now at 16%, but there might be even more juice left to squeeze. The discount could easily become a premium, something that is not unprecedented. GBTC discount/premium to NAV (Ycharts) Back in the height of the bull market, the GBTC premium reached close to 40% Technical Outlook With this new high in GBTC, the odds are increasing that we are beginning a much larger rally. GBTC TA (Author's work) The way I see it, the move we saw up to $22 was an initial wave 1. The sell-off back to $17 was our wave 2, and now we could be beginning another impulse in our large-degree wave 3. Taking the length of our wave 1 and measuring from the bottom of our wave 2 would protect us towards at least $31 for wave 3, which would be the 1 ext. More likely, though, we could rally into the 1.619 ext, which would take us all the way up to $40. A Word Of Caution While I am indeed bullish on GBTC, there are some potential risks here. Firstly, all investors should know that owning GBTC is very different from owning and storing your own BTC. As the old saying goes, not your keys not your crypto. On another note, I believe that the ETF approval could act as a double-edged sword. While I do believe it will be overall bullish, I believe once the ETF gets approved, we could see Bitcoin and GBTC struggle. Once the ETF has been approved, Bitcoin may need to find another catalyst to spark interest. And on that note, while I mentioned above that GBTC could end up trading at a premium, the odds of this are much lower if, indeed a spot BTC ETF does get approved. Just like the discount will likely be removed, so will the premium.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4641317-did-sec-admit-defeat-bitcoin-etf-could-be-near?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/18970205.jpeg

She sees other payments services, including FedNow, as better alternatives.  U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman is uncertain if the U.S. needs to get into the central bank digital currency (CBDC) business.  ""The potential benefits of a U.S. CBDC remain unclear, and the introduction of a U.S. CBDC could pose significant risks and tradeoffs for the financial system,"" Bowman said Tuesday at a Harvard Law School event in Washington.  The Fed is researching the possibilities of a digital U.S. dollar and would likely be the government entity to issue it. However, officials, including Chairman Jerome Powell and Vice Chairman for Supervision Michael Barr, have said the central bank won't make a move without White House sign-off and authorization from Congress. And Republican lawmakers have pushed legislation to ban the U.S. government from taking that step.  ""We have seen a range of arguments in the public debate about issuing a CBDC, including addressing frictions within the payment system, promoting financial inclusion, and providing the public with access to safe central bank money,"" said Bowman, one of seven members of the Federal Reserve Board that oversees U.S. payments systems and banking. ""I have yet to see a compelling argument that a U.S. CBDC could solve any of these problems more effectively or efficiently than alternatives, or with fewer downside risks for consumers and for the economy.""  She noted that the central bank has already launched FedNow – a real-time payments clearing system through the U.S. banking system – and that Wall Street banks have also backed a similar private system, so consumers can now move money immediately.  ""It is quite possible that other proposed solutions may address many or all of the problems that a CBDC would address, but in a more effective and efficient way,"" she said.  Bowman also flagged the risks she sees from private stablecoins, the tokens linked to steady assets such as the dollar that are integral to the crypto markets.  ""Stablecoins purport to have convertibility one-for-one with the dollar, but in practice have been less secure, less stable, and less regulated than traditional forms of money,"" she said, suggesting the Fed should be figuring out how to impose bank-like regulation on the issuers of these tokens.

Back then, it was mostly just rumors and speculation, but the XRP community has gotten their hands on a Ripple job listing that suggests there might be some truth to the IPO rumors. Ripple Is Looking For A Shareholder Communications Manager In a listing that was shared by multiple influencers in the XRP community, Ripple looks to be on the hunt for a Shareholder Communications Senior Manager. Now, according to the job listing requirements, whoever is accepted for this role will be expected to basically work with multiple teams at Ripple and maintain communications between ‘prospective shareholders and investors.’ Related Reading: Crypto Research Firm Predicts 200% XRP Price Rally To $1.5 Also, the individual will be “managing a shareholder database/mailing list and investor/analyst communication database.” Given this description, many in the community have taken it as a sign that Ripple is hiring in preparation for a potential IPO. Source: X Some of the job descriptions also coincide with things and events that tend to take place in companies that have undergone the IPO process. One example pointed out in this Bitcoinist report is the Annual Analyst Day expected to the carried out by the Shareholder Communications Senior Manager. This is an event that is done by publicly traded companies. The expectations of a Ripple IPO go as far back as 2020 when its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Brad Garlinghouse first talked about initial public offerings in crypto. Back then, Garlinghouse had said that “you’ll see initial public offerings in the crypto/blockchain space” in the next 12 months. He wasn’t far off as Coinbase would become the first crypto exchange to go public the next year on April 14, 2021. What Happens To XRP Price Is There Is An IPO? The impact of a potential Ripple IPO on the XRP price has been discussed at length, especially in the second half of this year. One of the very first mentions of this was by financial expert Linda Jones who talked at length about how valuable Ripple would be if there were an IPO. Related Reading: How Ripple’s Rumored Token Burn Could Affect The XRP Price Using the XRP market cap, Jones explained that at $35 a share, Ripple would be valued at $5.7 billion which is much lower than XRP’s $21 billion valuation. So the financial expert explained that Ripple’s valuation would be a lot higher. Eventually, she arrived at a $107 billion valuation which would mean Ripple stock would trade at a price of $600. Using XRP’s correlation to Ripple’s development, this could easily see the XRP price surge above $100. Crypto influencer Ben Armstrong aka BitBoy also shared his thoughts on what would happen to the XRP price in the event of an IPO. The influencer said back in July that he expects the XRP price to reach as high as $35 if Ripple were to undergo such a situation. While there is no confirmation from Ripple on this news, the consensus remains that such a move would be bullish for the XRP price.

The former Bankman-Fried confidant's admission marked the first time since the trial began two weeks ago that the defense has seemingly managed to poke a hole in the case against their client, whose empire crumbled nearly a year ago.  Read all CoinDesk's coverage here.  Singh's second day of testimony against his former friend, roommate and colleague began with relatively calm, but steady, questions from attorney Mark Cohen, who's leading the defense.  Cohen walked Singh through his testimony from the day before, seeming to build up to question Singh's memory of his conversations regarding a bug in Alameda's code in June 2022 and his response to the FTX team living in a luxury penthouse in the Bahamas.  Didn't Singh tell prosecutors he had a ""surprising amount of haziness"" about the sequence of events from June 2022, Cohen asked after having Singh walk through that very sequence. Singh said he could not remember what he told prosecutors at the meeting Cohen highlighted, which took place in January 2023.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Roos, on his redirect examination, cleared up one of these questions: Singh had never seen the notes Cohen referred to. Prosecutors had compiled them over the course of the investigation but they were not shared, meaning the first time Singh saw the notes was during the cross-examination on Tuesday.  Defense attorney Cohen also questioned Singh's assertion that the penthouse at the Orchid, a facility in the Bahamas' upscale Albany area, was too expensive. Singh, Bankman-Fried and other residents of the penthouse were billionaires or multimillionaires, so was the choice of residence appropriate for that level of wealth, Cohen asked. Singh said he wasn't sure.  Cohen also asked if Singh had a view on Alameda borrowing funds so long as the company's assets were in excess of borrows. Singh told the court he did not think it was appropriate. Cohen sighed.  Cohen completed his questioning of Singh in the early afternoon, after finding a few similar discrepancies between what the former FTX executive told the jury Monday and Tuesday, and what he'd supposedly told prosecutors in the months leading up to the trial.  Cell site analysis  After Singh finished testifying, prosecutors called FBI agent Richard Busick to the stand.  Busick, a specialist in cell site analysis, spent an hour confirming that a certain cell phone number, which prosecutors said belonged to Bankman-Fried, was active in New York at various times through 2021 and 2022.  The defense, in its cross-examination, asked Busick if he could confirm who was using the phone at the times he analyzed its data. Busick said he could not.  Prosecutors said they expected to call Peter Easton, a financial forensics expert, on Wednesday to discuss financial flows.

The fund, Unbroken Chain, will be led by Asher Corson, portfolio manager at Consolidated Trading, according to a press release. General partners include UXTO Management, the fund arm of Bitcoin Magazine owner BTC Inc., and Isabel Foxen Duke, the former communications director of Ordinals creator Casey Rodarmor.  The new fund claims to be ""the first managed funds to actively trade Ordinals and inscriptions,"" including BRC-20 tokens, a category whose name flicks at the ubiquitous ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum. Anonymous BRC-20 creator ""Domo"" is also backing the Unbroken Chain fund.  Unbroken Chain has already started investing early contributions of $1.5 million, with initial assets including a Bitcoin Rock – from the first contiguous collection of inscribed Ordinals – purchased on Sept. 20 for 3 BTC (roughly $85,000), according to the statement.  Ordinals is a protocol that allows non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to be stored on the Bitcoin blockchain, through embedding data, known as ""inscriptions,"" into smaller BTC transactions.  While Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens could bring greater utility to Bitcoin, they are controversial among some developers who believe that they are clogging up the network and raising fees and that they ""pollute"" the blockchain with data that has nothing to do with Satoshi Nakamoto’s mission of a peer-to-peer system of money transfer.  “We’re thrilled to be leading the charge of institutional investment directly into Ordinals assets,” UTXO Management investor and Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey said in the release.

Bitcoin Taker Buy Sell Ratio Saw Extraordinary Spikes On Bybit & Deribit Yesterday In a new post on X, Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, discussed how the BTC taker buy-sell ratio looked like for the different exchanges in the market leading up to the surprise rally yesterday. The “taker buy sell ratio” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the taker buy and taker sell volumes for Bitcoin on any given exchange (or group of platforms). Related Reading: Crypto Shorts See Carnage As Bitcoin Surges Towards $28,000 When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means that the taker buy volume is more than the sell volume currently. Such a trend suggests that the investors are willing to pay more to purchase the asset and thus, a bullish sentiment is shared by the majority. On the other hand, a value under the threshold implies a bearish mentality is active on the exchange as the traders are willing to sell the asset at a lower price at the moment. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 24-day simple moving average (SMA) Bitcoin taker buy-sell ratio over the past few days for four exchanges: Binance, OKX, Bybit, and Deribit. Looks like the value of the metric was quite high on the bottom two platforms | Source: @jjcmoreno on X Yesterday, Bitcoin saw a very sharp sudden rally as false news broke out that the iShares BTC spot ETF had been approved by the US SEC. This surge, however, retraced in as spectacular a fashion as it had occurred as the market quickly realized that the rumor was without any substance. From the chart, it’s visible that all four of these exchanges saw spikes in the taker buy-sell ratio in the hours leading up to this rally. The spikes on Binance and OKX, though, were of pretty normal levels, as spikes of similar scales had occurred in the preceding days as well. In the case of Bybit and Deribit, however, the 24-day SMA of the ratio had hit peaks of 41 and 98, respectively, which are both extremely high levels. For comparison, the indicator only hit 1.8 on Binance and 6.3 on OKX.

42409560,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcKg2Q,1697554530,Why Congress Will Be the Dollar’s Downfall,"If you are someone who cares about the future of America’s economy, you should take a minute to read this article.  Since you’re reading CoinDesk, you likely have a foundational understanding of cryptocurrency, stablecoins and digital assets. But if you’re an American who wants the dollar to remain dominant, you should also understand why it’s imperative these financial technologies be developed here, not abroad. Otherwise, these technologies will be used to end the dollar’s leadership in the global economy.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's State of Crypto Week, sponsored by Chainalysis. Amanda Wick is principal at Incite Consulting.  Too many people who should know better say de-dollarization isn’t a real concern. Rather than facts to support their view, they spout a long-unmerited, unbridled American exceptionalism. In reality, since Bretton Woods, America has enjoyed an unnatural advantage from global use of the dollar, which has masked our slide into toxic political polarization and democratic erosion.  The power of the dollar, which we probably haven’t deserved for 70 years (or at least since Nixon delinked our currency from gold in 1971), enabled the development of a completely broken political system, painting over the mold and decay our politics have become.  De-dollarization is a real concern having recently had a front-row seat at the national-level dialog on the subject. I have seen first-hand the massive problems we face as a country and watched as both political parties ignored them for perceived selfish gain.  From 2021 to 2022, I served on the House Select Committee working with a team of the world’s greatest investigators researching the many causes of the Jan. 6, 2020 attack on the U.S. Capitol building.  And let’s be clear, there were many.  We tried to convey the clear and present danger of big tech companies, misinformation campaigns, polarization and the rise of extremism and hate groups. As the lead financial investigator, I looked into not only who funded the attack, but also how right wing extremism was funded, how our financial system responded (or didn’t), and what recommendations could help prevent future attacks.  Most of these findings were omitted from the final report. Consequently, I rarely speak about that year of my life, mostly because of the depression and fear for the future it evokes. But we are hurtling towards de-dollarization too quickly to remain quiet.  See also: Stablecoins: A Potential Counter to De-Dollarization | Opinion  With every article, op-ed and blog post explaining the rise of alternative currencies, the risks they pose to dollar dominance, and the need for congressional action, I see countless canaries dying in the coal mine of a dollar-led global financial system.  I think back to all the findings and legislative recommendations we made that never saw the light of day and how little Congress has done to address any of the major problems we identified. We had a chance to warn America how Jan. 6 was simply a piece of the paint peeling off and what had been growing underneath for 70 years prior was terrifying.  But Congress just kept painting. What do I mean?  Imagine we were tasked with investigating the cause of a massive wildfire with a goal of preventing future wildfires. Our investigation found there was a dry forest located in a highly populated area where people dragged dry wood for years, strategically stacking it to burn hotter and higher, and then doused with kerosene, yet the committee's final report blamed it all on the person with a match.  Don’t get me wrong, as a former federal prosecutor, I certainly believe the person with the match should be held fully accountable. However, if the investigative report detailing the causes of that wildfire — which is supposed to help us prevent the next wildfire — ignores all of the other causes, then what we have left is a forest that remains filled with dry wood, strategically stacked for a bad burn, covered in the same kerosene, ready and waiting for the next arsonist who may be smart enough to bring a flamethrower.  Pretending the individual with the match is the only cause is more paint covering our problems.  If you’re paying attention to what is happening in the U.S. right now, across many sectors — advertising, social media, generative AI, for-profit journalism — you'll see there are countless canaries warning us about the direction we are headed in, including the suppression of digital asset technology innovation and de-dollarization’s impact on national security.  Congress needs to stop painting over problems and start fixing them.  In a world without dollar dominance, left uncorrected, our real problems lead to a geopolitical landscape in which the U.S. cannot win in a fair fight to remain an economic superpower.  If you’re a fan of democracy and the concept of what America could be — as opposed to who she is now — you should be reading everything you can about that forest and asking how you too can prevent fires. Call your elected federal and state representatives and demand action, and keep the pressure on not letting digital asset innovation slip in the U.S. This is how you, as a citizen, can help prevent de-dollarization.  See also: Everyone Is Talking About De-Dollarization, Is There Anything to It?  Maybe we can’t dismantle all the pieces of wood at once, but we should start with the one that’s most flammable.

42409553,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcKfsV,1697552387,"What’s Holding Crypto Back? It’s the Founders, Not Just Regulators","The prevailing narrative for the past several years around blockchain and digital assets has been that regulatory risk is the biggest threat to the industry, but that’s false.  If the past two years have taught us anything, it’s that regulators will work at their own pace to sort rules and regulations; and we must continue to educate and lobby about Web3 technology on a global front. However, as an industry we also need to address the elephant in the room: founder risk, and not accept this as par for the crypto course.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's State of Crypto Week sponsored by Chainalysis. Margaret Rosenfeld is the chief legal officer at Cube Group and former lawyer at Deltec International Group.  In what seems like the blink of an eye, the leading lights of our industry have gone from starlets to snake oil salesman — the list of implosions reads like a who’s who of whom mattered only two years ago — FTX, Voyager and looking farther back Mt. Gox and Quadriga, the list goes on seemingly forever; but how did these platforms fail, and how were they able to take billions of dollars in client capital down with them?  Are regulators to blame?  Our industry pounds the drum about the lack of clear regulation when enforcement regulators come after projects. And I agree that about 90% of the time this drumbeat is true. But exchange founders that lost or misused client assets in their custody can’t really claim a lack of regulatory clarity as a defense.  There is a single aspect of digital asset and Web3 market structure that differs from traditional markets, and this difference is what has led to most of the pain in our industry — no industry standards around asset custody.  Anyone who understands basic finance knows a simple truth: assets should be segregated from where they are traded. The platform where you trade should not also be where your assets are held. This is a clear conflict of interest that, until remedied, will lead to continued asset vaporization.  Really?  Most of the prominent people in crypto built their bonafides claiming they have traditional markets experience. From Sam Bankman-Fried’s time at Jane Street to Voyager CEO Steve Ehrlich’s time at ETrade, people tend to tout their Wall Street bone fides.  See also: Where Is Crypto Policy Heading in a Post-FTX World? | State of Crypto Week  In that world, exchanges and trading firms do not hold the assets that are traded on their order books. No one who wants to trade Apple (AAPL) stock hands their stock certificate to Nasdaq and says “hold my stock until the trade is settled” because most reasonable people understand that something could potentially go wrong during the time when the exchange has your funds.  That’s why assets typically sit with a third-party custodian such as Bank of NY Mellon or Fidelity, even if you have a broker in the middle such as Schwab or TD Ameritrade.  No transaction-based platform should act as a custodian, even if the founder claims that “banks aren’t your friends.”  The crypto conundrum  All centralized exchanges and brokers have roughly the same setup — which is custodying the asset that you trade with them. Given the amount of probes and criminal charges and trials currently publicly known, I simply don’t understand how this is still possible.  Think about this scenario for a second: you on-board to a centralized exchange and want to trade. You transfer your assets to the custody of the exchange and you then have an account ledger that reflects your balance and you can trade off that. But your assets actually sit in custody with the exchange, co-mingled with those of other traders. There are no segregated accounts and you have authorized the platform you are using to be able to move your assets at-will.  In fact, the terms of service of many of these platforms list you as an unsecured creditor in the event of a bankruptcy (which most people don’t know since who really reads the terms of service?). Even if the terms don’t, most jurisdictions will treat your assets as such. Basically, you are handing your hard earned investment funds over to a third-party who can do as they please with them, and you’ll be lucky in the event of an insolvency to receive pennies on the dollar.  Even worse — if the exchange can move your assets — they can abuse your trust. The truth is, you don’t know for sure where your assets really are and what an exchange might be doing with them. And, at this point, shame on you for falling for it again.  There is a solution  Many people call self-custody the answer — but there is honestly no such thing as self-custody because in order to be a custodian, you have to be a non-conflicted third-party who holds assets as your raison d’etre, you have to be Fidelity.  The segment of the industry obsessed over self-custody hasn’t yet grasped the obvious: most people do not have the technical knowledge, ability or desire to use self-custody wallets and manage seed phrases. This is how we end up with people on national news lamenting their loss of a quarter billion dollars.  You and I cannot be custodians, but we can meet in the middle, KYC’d/AML’d self-ownership with support for key recovery across a sharded database. I know this sounds complicated, but it isn’t.  In order to interact with a trading venue, you first pass KYC/AML compliance onboarding before putting your assets in a specially designated non-custodial wallet controlled by you that can interact seamlessly with the exchange. You face none of the risks stemming from omnibus accounts that are being used by every other centralized venue.  What this means is that your assets are physically unable to be mingled with others like what happened with FTX and Alameda Research — you are safe from any actions by a centralized party or individual.  By going through this process, you are ensuring that you are not a bad actor, not trading with other bad actors and your trading platform is showing that it adheres to regulatory requirements. You also are setting a baseline in the event you lose your seed phrase where it can potentially be recovered by going back through the KYC/AML process to prove your digital identity in the event of a seed phrase loss.  This is the path forward  Currently, the bulk of online users are on Web 2 platforms, and we want to get them onto Web3. The future is coming soon, but we have about a decade where we need to ease people into the idea of decentralized, autonomous ownership of assets. This transition will not be easy, but it will be among the most meaningful shifts in human history.  See also: Don't Pop the Champagne on U.S. Crypto Bills  We have likely hit the max on people who will do self-custody, and we need to evolve towards a more nuanced solution that enables mass adoption while also protecting from internal and founder risk at exchanges.  Rome wasn’t built in a day, and the financial markets of tomorrow will not be built overnight; but all this hard work will be worth it, and we call on the industry to meet users in the middle rather than force innovation down their throats long before they are ready to embrace it.  This will preserve assets, and build the trust needed for the mass adoption that will enable Web3 platforms to survive.

The rumors turned out false, but the cryptocurrency managed to reclaim a critical level.

Over the previous week, the cryptocurrency recorded similar gains while other cryptocurrencies in the top 10 by market cap lagged the sudden rally except for Solana (SOL). Bitcoin Price Confirms Bull Run? Data shared by the co-founders of analytics firm Glassnode highlights the importance of the recent rally. However, driven by what many in the crypto community called “fake news,” the upside momentum cleared some obstacles for the cryptocurrency. In that sense, the data points to a generally positive sentiment around the Bitcoin ETF, which will continue to gain relevance in the coming months as uncertainty about its approval mitigates. The Glassnode co-founders stated via social media platform X: While this pivotal milestone was momentarily attained on futures, the spot market price peaked at $27.98k earlier today. It’s evident just how crucial this price point is in the larger scheme (…). The rapid movements and these price thresholds aren’t just numbers. They signify investor sentiment, market dynamics. The market activity surrounding the ETF rumors on some major crypto exchanges represented around 8% of their total trading volume. However, Bitcoin must hold its current level on the daily and weekly charts. A separate analysis by a pseudonym trader claims that the recent Bitcoin price action broke out of a macro downtrend. As seen in the chart below, every time the cryptocurrency price breaks this trend, Bitcoin consolidates for a while before re-entering price discovery.

42409566,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcKgWB,1697550480,"When Bankruptcy Regulates Crypto: The Good, the Bad, and the (Really) Ugly","Without an established oversight regime, crypto winter has turned bankruptcy courts into accidental regulators of the digital asset market.  In the wake of Terra/Luna’s collapse in May 2022, followed by FTX’s spectacular demise a few months later, the crypto industry has become a heavy user of Chapter 11 bankruptcy. BlockFi, Celsius, Core Scientific, FTX/Alameda, Genesis Global, Prime Trust, Three Arrows Capital, Voyager — former linchpins of the crypto ecosystem — have all ended up filing. There have been bruising court battles. The legal costs have been staggering. Millions of customers have suffered enormous economic damage, hardship, and disillusionment.  Yesha Yadav is the Milton R. Underwood Chair, Associate Dean, and Professor of Law at Vanderbilt Law School. Robert Stark is Chair of the Bankruptcy and Restructuring Practice Group at Brown Rudnick LLP. This op-ed, part of CoinDesk’s “State of Crypto Week” is based on the longer article, “The Bankruptcy Court as Crypto Market Regulator,” here.  With bankruptcy courts taking control of some of crypto’s biggest firms and examining the market’s workings, it is worth asking whether this substitute regulatory regime is working, or whether its intervention is adding to the uncertainty facing the market.  How crypto bankruptcies are different  First, a little context. Most financial firms are, outside of bankruptcy, supervised by government regulators, like the Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission or the Federal Reserve. Bankruptcy works in tandem with the regulators, with bankruptcy focusing primarily on reworking the balance sheet and regulators continuing to monitor the company’s business practices. If all goes well, the company leaves bankruptcy in a sound financial position and without any objections voiced by regulatory supervisors.  This has not been the experience for crypto insolvencies. The digital asset industry has been allowed to mature without a dedicated regulatory framework, resulting in runaway risk-taking, opaque business practices, and suspect governance. More to the point, bankruptcy courts have found themselves largely on their own, sifting through the wreckage of 2022’s crypto winter without any regulatory support.  Courts have been forced to rely on the Bankruptcy Code to decide difficult legal questions that, traditionally, would have been addressed by regulators. And, they have been asked to take on this task in a tumultuous industry environment, where distressed and unpredictable conditions have made bankruptcy financing practically impossible to obtain. Even as bankruptcy courts have tried their best, their efforts at bringing order to crypto-markets have largely failed.  Still, bankruptcy’s intervention has generated important benefits for the industry. Bankruptcy’s objectives are often aligned with those of traditional regulation. Take disclosure. Bankruptcy courts are demanding when it comes to making companies reveal information about themselves, their business, what went wrong, and why. If circumstances point to serious wrongdoing (or management seems untrustworthy), bankruptcy courts can compel the appointment of an “examiner” to investigate facts and deliver a public report.  In the Celsius bankruptcy, the court-appointed examiner delivered a 689-page report detailing the firm’s lapses in internal controls, failures in risk management, and possible fraud. Seven months after the report’s publication, Alex Mashinsky – Celsius ex-CEO – was led off in handcuffs.  Read more: Where Is Crypto Policy Heading in a Post-FTX World?  Bankruptcy courts have also delivered powerful teaching moments to crypto enthusiasts and to regulatory authorities. In Celsius, the bankruptcy court was required to decide whether deposits in interest-bearing “Earn” accounts belonged to customers or to the bankruptcy estate. Celsius’ customers came to learn that, once they entrusted their digital assets with Celsius, the company was free to use them as it pleased. This rendered customers merely unsecured creditors of the bankrupt firm, left to fend for themselves near the bottom of the repayment ladder, with the crypto belonging legally to Celsius’ estate. The ruling was unsparing. But it directed regulatory authorities to a point of acute public vulnerability.  Policies without rule-making  Bankruptcy also gives regulators a forum to push policies without having to develop rule-making or legal actions of their own. When Voyager asked the bankruptcy court to approve its sale to Binance.US, the SEC intervened in opposition to the transaction. It argued that the sale came with serious regulatory problems, though it was unable to back up its contentions with evidence acceptable to the judge. The court brushed aside the SEC’s objections. But this highly visible attack — exposing profound regulatory risks hanging over the deal — caused it to fall through. Voyager proceeded to a liquidation.  Despite the regulatory overlap, bankruptcy courts are a very poor substitute for thoughtful administrative regulation. Crypto’s major insolvencies show that bankruptcy courts are simply not equipped for the job. Traditional oversight comes with a slate of public policy aims: reducing systemic risk; protecting customers; and creating usable knowledge for the consuming public. Bankruptcy law may have some similar intentions, but it cannot fully deliver on any of these goals.  Importantly, bankruptcy’s mission focuses on the particular debtor, its creditors, and stakeholders. It has only limited concern for the marketplace. This has serious consequences. Take disclosure — a foundational regulatory tool. Bankruptcy courts ensure that information is disseminated only to help the debtor’s stakeholders make an informed choice about the company’s fate in Chapter 11. Unlike standardized and vetted disclosures mandated by the SEC, bankruptcy delivers information incrementally, idiosyncratically, and in non-standard ways. Examiners are not appointed all that often. There isn’t one in FTX/Alameda, for example.  Bankruptcy courts also cannot help the crypto industry avoid insolvency-contagion and other forms of “systemic” risk. Traditional regulation includes tools that aid financial firms, such as providing deposit insurance or emergency federal financing. Such tools are not available to bankruptcy courts. Even here, bankruptcy has a short-sighted lens. It focuses just on the debtor and its stakeholders, and no more. If one bankruptcy filing causes a dozen more, that makes for a busy judicial caseload. Stopping further contagion is the work of traditional regulators.  Finally, bankruptcy courts apply the law as dictated by the Bankruptcy Code. Sometimes this results in outcomes that seem unfair to large numbers of innocent people. Harming any number of vulnerable stakeholders is the cost the Bankruptcy Code often accepts for saving a failing business.  The harm visited on Celsius’ customers is case in point. The court applied the law, regardless of the impact on the industry or customers. Even if this logic applies as a matter of bankruptcy law, it can feel deeply wrong as a matter of basic public policy. In traditional securities markets, customer assets generally never enter bankruptcy in the first place.  Ultimately, these crypto bankruptcies are providing a clear lesson: there is no substitute for comprehensive regulation of the industry. Bankruptcy can be helpful, but it is certainly not an effective regulator. A robust regulatory framework is urgently needed if the marketplace and its customers are to avoid another crypto winter even colder and deeper than this one.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,"Yesha Yadav, Robert Stark",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/17/when-bankruptcy-regulates-crypto-the-good-the-bad-and-the-really-ugly,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/753fbaa99b043ed3faaf306f889c088306f175f8-2932x1649.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409570,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcKgg6,1697549495,How African Students Became Victims of FTX’s Collapse,"“There were people who, because of their reputation, [their friends and family] trusted them. And now, after FTX collapsed, their reputation went,” a former Student Ambassador for FTX, in Nigeria, told CoinDesk several months ago.  This student is referring to a program run by FTX – the fallen crypto empire led by Sam Bankman-Fried – to promote the company in Africa, working through a network of student ambassadors who recruited their friends and family as customers to the trading platform. After FTX collapsed, the ambassadors were blamed by the people they recruited, in some cases even fearing for their personal safety as a result.  Like Binance and KuCoin, FTX Africa wanted to grow its user base in markets with abundant tech-focused youth populations. The program, which ran for about two years, targeted university students, encouraging them to apply to become “Brand Ambassadors” for FTX and host meetup events on their campuses.  The ambassadors received payment in return for their work. ""Most signed up but had no good knowledge of trading,"" said one person familiar with FTX's Ugandan student program, referring to how the students knew enough about crypto to know they could get rich, but not enough to know they might lose plenty of money as well.  CoinDesk has viewed and verified a copy of the FTX contract, which says the students would receive 30% of transaction fees paid by people they referred to FTX plus an additional $500 per month based on performance.  When FTX collapsed spectacularly last November, following CoinDesk reporting, people who had been brought to the exchange through ambassadors lost access to funds, some being life savings.  “I got a call from one of the ambassadors I worked with,” said the student CoinDesk interviewed. “He was crying [because his referred users had invested] 20 million naira because of him. Not just his own funds. People were just thinking they could save money [on FTX] and earn.”  At today’s Naira-dollar exchange rate, 20 million naira is about $26,000.  It is unclear how many university students participated in the ambassador program, but the official FTX Africa Telegram group, where students, ambassadors, and investors communicated with each other has more than 10,000 members. The channel has been closed to new messages for several months.  Read more: Everything to Know About Sam Bankman-Fried’s Second Week in Court  At the time of the interview, the student ambassador we spoke to had gone to ground, fearing revenge from community members who put funds on FTX because of him.  “This particular [ambassador] has been off the radar for five months … because people are looking for their money. People don’t want to understand that this particular exchange went down. What they understand is that they actually came to this exchange because of [the ambassador]. They say ‘you preached it, you were talking about it in every way.’”  The source says that, in some instances, former ambassadors have been threatened physically by those they referred to the exchange. “[They say] we want to know where our money is. I’m going to kill you. If you don’t give me my money, I’m going to look for you, I’m going to hunt you.”  The source explained that many of the ambassadors who received this type of potentially violent backlash were based in the eastern region of Nigeria, a more rural part of the country where FTX saw potential beyond university students.  This market was “untouched,” the former ambassador said, “most of these people don’t go to school ... they started hosting events in states … not just targeting students now.” Ambassadors in these areas were not just promoting the brand to their academic peers, but to the broader populations where they were based, and they took the fall when the exchange declared bankruptcy.  The student program became a “mainstay of crypto education at some top Nigerian universities,” said CoinDesk contributor Olumide Adesina. “FTX was making a lot of noise and in a matter of months, we learned that many Africans were leaving platforms for FTX,” the Nigeria team for bitcoin exchange Paxful wrote prior to its own suspension.  The meetups were popular, the student CoinDesk spoke with said. “Everyone wanted to come,” this person said. It turned into a “meetup for crypto traders to come, learn, and connect.”  The Brand Ambassadors received $1 for every student who attended the meetups. Following the meetings, the students received a link to register their trading volumes. An algorithm built by FTX’s team then calculated how much the ambassadors should receive as their share.  Pius Okedinachi, FTX Africa’s former Education Lead and also a Brand Ambassador, told CoinDesk how universities were selected for sponsored events after a student affiliate applied to host one. “If we have good numbers, and it’s promising, and we’ll check the campus to check the involvement, we check what the ambassador is doing, then it can be passed across to the FTX main team [not FTX Africa],” he explained.  Though the events were promoted as educational, they were aimed at signing up students to increase trading volumes. “There’s no way we would educate people and then not talk about our product which is FTX. … For us, the campus was [for] building communities and then also driving user volume and user database,” Okendinachi said.  Our student source in Nigeria backed this up. “All this was to educate my community a bit more about what crypto is, not FTX exactly. But at the same time I was driving volumes and getting more people for FTX,” a former student ambassador told CoinDesk.  The process of becoming an FTX ambassador did not resemble that of a typical job application and was more focused on popularity and interest in crypto investing. “There was not too much activity of where is your CV, where have you worked before,” according to the student. “The criteria for becoming a student ambassador was quite little and not strict.”  The ambassador program was managed by Adebayo Juwon, FTX Africa’s Business Development Manager. In a 2021 interview, Juwon said, “We have taken the time to vet, select & train students who are avid FTX users, converted them to FTX Campus Ambassadors and most importantly empowered them.”  “Primarily, the aim is to enable them to understand what these concepts and technology are all about, what can be learnt from them, their advantages and the job opportunities available in the space,” he told the Nigerian publication Business Day in 2002. Juwon has not responded to CoinDesk’s requests for comment.  Nigeria has long struggled with inflation and monetary uncertainty. Many who heard of FTX either through ambassadors or the exchange’s robust marketing were keen to invest in crypto as a way to hedge against the devaluation of the Naira. FTX was “not only for crypto trading but also for converting local money into dollars, turning FTX into a de facto bank for locals,” said Olumide Adesina.  Okedinachi, FTX Africa’s former Education Lead, said using crypto exchanges to convert local currency to dollar-pegged stablecoins like Tether's USDT became popular because buying dollars on the black market could come at a $200 premium over the exchange rate. FTX was known for relatively low trading fees by contrast. “Due to the access of U.S. dollars in Nigeria, a lot of people actually resolved to using crypto for payments of good services,” extending FTX’s reach and cryptocurrency adoption far beyond university students interested in a new technology, he stated.  FTX’s campus tour took in other African countries like South Africa and Ghana. That being said, Brindon Mwiine, a former student ambassador for FTX in Uganda, claimed that the most impacted universities were in Nigeria, where the student program was most established.“There’s been a lot of global exchanges and players targeting Africa because it’s clear that the emerging markets will be where a lot of the utility and user adoption will come from,” said Yele Bademosi, CEO of Nestcoin, a Nigerian crypto startup that used FTX as a custodian (Nestcoin also received funding from Alameda Research). Surveys show strong interest in crypto among Nigeria’s large youthful population.  With exchanges like Binance still running ambassadorships in African countries, students have become increasingly skeptical of the programs, following their experiences with FTX. “You cannot find Binance doing campus programs in U.S. universities and campuses, but they know Africa is a place where you can do things, speak to some regulators, and get as many users as you want.”  “People are no longer thinking about working for a big exchange anymore, they’re looking at how insured is this, and how much of my reputation am I putting on the line,” said the former FTX student ambassador.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Dilin Massand,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/10/17/how-african-students-became-victims-of-ftxs-collapse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7a7d10b2829c0118553d26455079410c008f8de5-512x288.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419457,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUETsb,1697549400,The Sam Bankman-Fried Trial Is Revealing Crypto's Amateur-Hour Ways,"A number of major crypto companies did not look at audited financial statements prior to investing or loaning FTX and Alameda Research billions of dollars. This won’t help the industry’s case in Washington or on Wall Street.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  It’s raining unaudited financials  The narrative  Paradigm, BlockFi, Genesis and other companies did not have access to audited financial statements prior to investing or loaning billions to FTX, FTX.US. and Alameda Research, according to testimonies given in the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried. Rather, these investors and lenders looked at unaudited financial statements and spoke with the executives at these companies to determine critical pieces of information like FTX's cash flow, its liabilities, its current assets and net asset value.  Why it matters  Everyone, including regulators, is paying renewed attention to the FTX and Alameda Research collapse. The amateur-hour practices coming out in that courtroom are unlikely to impress anyone in traditional finance or in policy, underscoring the distance crypto still has to cover to be taken seriously by the TradFi world.  Breaking it down  Last week, BlockFi CEO Zac Prince testified that most cryptocurrency companies had trouble getting audits, so his team mostly looked at unaudited financials or ""effectively any and all financial information that the potential borrower was willing to share with us.""  His testimony came days after former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison testified that she had doctored internal balance sheets that she then sent to companies including Genesis (a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent), which, like BlockFi, had also loaned funds to Alameda.  While the crypto industry's struggles with auditing aren't new, relying on unaudited financials prepared by stressed out twenty-somethings who unbeknownst to you were trying to hide a multibillion dollar hole on their balance sheets is just an insane way to handle billions of dollars.  For an industry that loves to express the motto ""don't trust, verify,"" it is entirely unsurprising that the opposite of that motto sank so many companies – including BlockFi and Genesis, which filed for bankruptcy protection between November 2022 and January 2023, respectively.  FTX in particular seems to be an excellent example of just how toxic the hype cycle can be, though. It looked like a good company – Paradigm's Matt Huang previously testified that its rapid growth was a factor in his firm investing $278 million in the FTX empire – and drew attention from so, so many people.  It's a sharp contrast with SEC-regulated companies, one auditor told CoinDesk. Public companies receive regularly audited financials.  ""It is very unusual to just accept unaudited financial sheets … [if anything] you'd expect that to be anchored to an audit once a year,"" said the auditor, who did not want to be identified.  At a minimum, executives from the lenders might be expected to discuss the unaudited financial results in excruciatingly comprehensive detail with executives from borrowers – in this case Alameda Research – more than we’ve heard discussed from testimony so far.  The lenders would need to understand the competency of the executives at the borrower and what kind of financial controls are in place, as well as how the borrowers came up with the evaluation for the collateral being put up to secure the loans.  ""These guys couldn't possibly be more of a mess,"" the auditor said of FTX and Alameda.  The scale of the collapse also calls into question just what kind of due diligence may be needed to evaluate crypto companies' financial health in future.  Prince testified that BlockFi had conducted due diligence on the FTX and Alameda teams prior to making the initial loans, though mainly BlockFi's legal team handled this, he said.  Genesis's press email did not respond to a request for comment about its own due diligence process during the time that it was lending funds to Alameda, though the company has shut down operations since filing for bankruptcy earlier this year.  Tying this back to regulators, it's very likely that FTX’s collapse and the way it took down several other crypto companies is going to continue to reverberate through the halls of Washington, D.C. and other national capitals.  And again it's well known that crypto companies have difficulty securing auditors for a number of reasons. But the industry will likely need to find ways of solving these issues if it wants to be taken seriously.  Stories you may have missed  California 'BitLicense' Bill Signed by Gov.

Blackrock CEO Responds To Claims On Bitcoin Spot ETF On Monday, crypto news outlet CoinTelegraph posted on X (formerly Twitter) that the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved a long-anticipated application of Bitcoin Spot ETF, but later retracted the report. However, the post sparked excitement within the crypto community causing the Bitcoin price to rise rapidly. Related Reading: Bloomberg Analyst Predicts Likelihood Of A Spot Bitcoin ETF By January 2024 The cryptocurrency’s price surged to almost $30,000 earlier in the day after the alleged post was made by Cointelegraph yesterday. However, the cryptocurrency’s price fell almost immediately after the report was proven to be false by Blackrock’s Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink and other prominent voices in the crypto community. Eleanor Terrett was the first to report that this news was false after speaking with BlackRock and that the company’s Bitcoin Spot ETF is still under review by the US regulator. BTC spikes following fake Spot BTC ETF approval news | Source: BTUCSD on Tradingview.com In an interview with Fox Business, Fink, who said he only learned about the ‘news’ hours later due to him being extremely busy all day, took a rather positive stance on the event. According to the CEO, noting that Monday’s event solely proved the worldwide need and desire for a Bitcoin spot ETF. “I think the rally today is about a flight to quality, with all the issues around the Israeli war now, global terrorism,” Fink said. “I think there are more people running into a flight to quality, whether that is in Treasuries, gold, or crypto, depending on how you think of it. And I believe crypto will play that type of role, as a flight to quality.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Addresses See Unprecedented Jump, Is $30,000 Possible? The SEC also confirmed that the alleged news report was false and that the application is still pending. “Careful what you read on the internet. The best source of information about the SEC is the SEC.” the post read. So far, CoinTelegrah has apologized with a post on X for the false report it posted “which led to the dissemination of inaccurate information.” The crypto media outlet later posted the result of its internal investigation which showed a team member had posted the ‘news’ without getting approval from its editorial team. Crypto tracker, Coinglass revealed that short trading positions held by investors betting on lower prices were liquidated to the tune of over $104 million within 24 hours due to the false news.

The financial details of the deal were not made public.  Crypto has a reputation for fast-paced, speculative and complex trading strategies. Many institutional players and some of the original crypto firms are looking to offer secure long-term holdings with a focus on mainstream wealth managers and regulated investment advisors (RIAs).  How the crypto market is poised to react to the likely imminent approval of a spot bitcoin (BTC) ETF ought to be a wake-up call to wealth managers and RIAs, according to BitGo CEO Mike Belshe.  “RIAs should absolutely be calling up BitGo, getting HeightZero, getting qualified custody and doing it now, before the ETF,” Belshe said in an interview. “Because when the ETF hits, there’s going to be massive demand for bitcoin. Now, you can wait for the ETF, and then you can invest in that. But you’re going to miss out on a big growth.”  HeightZero handles portfolio rebalancing, statement generation, tax loss harvesting and automated billing for crypto clients. The firm used BitGo custody for some time before becoming joining the larger firm.  For its part, BitGo recently raised $100 million and is known to be on the acquisition trail.  “This downturn has unfortunately meant a lot of companies coming to the end of their runway and you can be looking at a distressed asset type of purchase,” Belshe said. “Sometimes these can work out and we will of course look at everything. But we’d like to think we have a little bit more strategic path forward, and I think HeightZero is a good example of that.”  Read more: BitGo Signs Strategic Agreement With Korean Heavyweight Hana Bank",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/10/17/bitgo-buys-crypto-wealth-management-platform-heightzero,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/427f939ef8fc800b3c4e0fa2b3398d48f5ecf159-1053x1062.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419460,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUETtd,1697544060,First Mover Americas: FTX Proposes Returning Up to 90% of Customer Funds,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices     Top Stories  Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX floated an amended proposal to return up to 90% of creditor holdings held at the exchange before it went bust last November. The debtors' group will formally file the plan to a U.S. bankruptcy court for perusal by Dec. 16. The proposal states that customers with a preference settlement of less than $250,000 can accept the settlement without any reduction of claim or payment. Preference settlement is 15% of customer withdrawals on the exchange, nine days before it went under. Creditors would further receive a ""Shortfall Claim"" against the general pool corresponding to the estimated value of assets missing at their exchange – estimated to be nearly $9 billion for FTX.com and $166 million for FTX.US, the exchange’s U.S. arm. However, recoveries could be marred by various factors, such as taxes, government claims, token price fluctuation, etc.  Binance has long been the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Still, on Monday, traders looking to buy and sell bitcoin (BTC) quickly on Binance were at a relative disadvantage to their peers on Kraken and Coinbase (COIN), according to data tracked by Paris-based Kaiko. The 0.1% ask depth on Binance, a measure of buy-side liquidity, crashed to just 1.2 BTC ($30,000) from 100 BTC as volatility exploded after an erroneous report that BlackRock's (BLK) spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) had been approved circulated on social media. The leading cryptocurrency popped 7.5% to $30,000 in a knee-jerk reaction to the rumor, only to give up gains after BlackRock denied the report.  California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a crypto licensing bill on Friday to take effect in July 2025. Considered California's answer to New York's ""BitLicense,"" the Digital Financial Assets Law faced heavy industry criticism, but was passed by the state's Assembly in September 2022. The law requires California's Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) to create a regulatory framework for crypto. The framework includes a licensing regime and gives the department enforcement and rulemaking authority over the sector. The DFPI also gets an 18-month implementation period to ensure ""the adopted regulatory framework can be thoughtfully tailored to address industry trends and mitigate consumer harm,"" the letter said.  Chart of The Day  The chart shows the 24-hour change in trading volume in bitcoin options at strikes ranging from $10,000 to $120,000.  The call option at the $30,000 strike has seen the highest trading volume in the past 24 hours as traders scrambled to take a bullish exposure amid the spot ETF approval rumor.

18960928,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555702,1697544057,Leading Video Game Company Embraces XRP As Price Faces Key Resistance,"BitPay, the pioneering crypto payment service provider based in Atlanta, Georgia, has taken another significant step in its collaboration with global video game commerce company, Xsolla, by integrating the XRP token. Today, October 17, BitPay announced via X (formerly Twitter): “Xsolla now accepts XRP with BitPay as a payment method for their games, such as SMITE and Roblox. You can use your favorite cryptocurrency to buy, play, and enjoy gaming like never before.” Why This Announcement Is Important This announcement not only cements XRP’s growing relevance in the gaming world but also marks a significant moment in the longstanding partnership between Xsolla and BitPay. This relationship first began in 2014 when Xsolla decided to process Bitcoin (BTC) payments for gamers globally via BitPay. They’ve since expanded their crypto payment offerings, with the recent addition of PayPal USD (PYUSD) last month. Established in 2005 by Aleksandr Agapitov, Xsolla has positioned itself as an instrumental force in the gaming industry, providing essential tools that help game developers launch, monetize, and distribute their creations on a global scale. With Xsolla’s key focus on aiding its partners to break geographical barriers and bolster revenue streams, the company continually seeks innovative solutions to global game distribution challenges. Related Reading: Elliott Wave Theory Forecasts XRP Price Of $27 By 2026: Crypto Analyst Roblox, the popular online gaming platform boasting over 65.5 million daily active users and over 202 million monthly active users, stands out as a significant beneficiary of the XRP integration. Managed by Xsolla for in-game payments, Roblox now allows its vast user base to utilize XRP for transactions, with BitPay ensuring a smooth connection with crypto wallets. Given that Roblox users spent an astonishing $780.7 million on in-game purchases in just the second quarter of 2023, the potential volume of XRP transactions on the platform could be monumental. Remarkably, BitPay’s association with XRP can be traced back to 2019 when they collaborated with Ripple’s investment wing, Xpring. However, the relationship hit a snag when BitPay, in alignment with many US-based crypto enterprises, ceased XRP-related transactions following the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs. The tide turned in favor of XRP when Judge Torres identified it as a non-security, prompting BitPay to reintroduce the cryptocurrency on its platform in August. XRP Price Faces Stiff Resistance The recent announcement undoubtedly solidifies XRP’s position in the broader market, showcasing its versatility. However, despite the promising long-term prospects stemming from XRP’s new use case, its price is currently contending with multiple key resistance levels. Related Reading: XRP On The Cusp Of Redemption? Unveiling Data-Backed Insights Following a brief surge yesterday, attributed to the fake news surrounding a potential spot Bitcoin ETF, XRP’s price experienced a pullback, dipping below the $0.50 mark. On the 4-hour chart, the price slid beneath the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, pegged at $0.4908. Yet, it demonstrated resilience, rebounding and securing a close above the 20-EMA. In the more immediate time frame, the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level, set at $0.5048, now emerges as the pivotal resistance. A sustained close above this threshold on the 4-hour chart might be the catalyst for renewed bullish vigor. Should this momentum be achieved, the next focal point for the XRP price would be the September high of $0.55.

42419449,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUETmP,1697543256,Ripple VP: The Policy Considerations 'Justifying the Implementation of CBDCs',"Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have emerged at the forefront of financial innovation with striking and transformative momentum in recent years, having the potential to transform our perception of and interaction with money. For many of the world’s central banks, discussion around CBDCs has shifted from “if” they will be developed to “when” they will be introduced and widely used.  James Wallis is Ripple's Vice President of central bank engagements and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).  Developing a CBDC is a complex undertaking, given the interdependencies between policy and technology, as well as potential market impacts. If designed prudently, CBDCs can offer more resilience, enhanced security, increased access and lower costs compared to traditional forms of money.  Towards this end, the success of a CBDC is anchored by three core pillars of design: technology, policy and usability, with user privacy as an underlying consideration for each.  The first is technology. For CBDCs to move from experimentation to real-world implementation, they must have a resilient, secure technical infrastructure with the ability to onboard, authenticate and support users on a massive scale. It must offer boundless horizontal scalability capabilities to cope with an ever-increasing throughput of transactions.  Moreover, since it is unlikely that different countries will decide on the same infrastructure, a CBDC should be capable of interoperating across different technical infrastructures in order to reap the benefits of frictionless cross-border transactions.  The second pillar is policy, or the rules and guardrails established by the central bank and governments that underpin the entire ecosystem. This is, perhaps, the most time-consuming area for consideration, given the specific priorities and regulatory frameworks of each country and its central bank.  While enthusiasm from users and financial institutions is a significant factor for successful adoption, there are situations where CBDCs might still be introduced despite initial skepticism. Political motivations and policy objectives can play a crucial role in justifying the implementation of CBDCs.  The payments industry will need to adapt to the changing landscape such as adjusting operations and infrastructure to accommodate CBDCs. Collaboration, therefore, between commercial banks, retailers and central banks is essential to ensure a smooth transition and effective integration of CBDCs into the broader financial ecosystem.  Without seamless cross-border functionality, most CBDC projects could significantly underachieve their potential.  Even with the technology and policy pillars in place, the key to sustainable real-world CBDC application ultimately hinges upon usability, the third design pillar of a well-functioning CBDC.  As with any new solution, driving early adoption is going to be one of the most important and challenging tasks that central banks will face should they decide to adopt a CBDC. A user-centric approach is therefore critical to help ensure that people and businesses can use CBDC easily and intuitively. Without a smooth, frictionless end-user wallet experience, the technology-driven newness may pose a barrier to adoption for many.  Central banks and the private sector should offer benefits to make users and financial institutions excited about CBDCs. These benefits include providing a user-friendly experience, ensuring enhanced security and privacy, highlighting cost savings and efficiency, promoting financial inclusion and accessibility, enabling interoperability and cross-border use, fostering innovation and partnership opportunities and establishing regulatory clarity and stability.  See also: If Money Is Speech, CBDCs Should Be Tools for Freedom | Opinion  For a digital currency to have any utility to people and businesses, it needs to coexist and interact with other payment schemes in that domestic market. The next level of interoperability for CBDCs is the ability to work for global transactions. Without seamless cross-border functionality, most CBDC projects could significantly underachieve their potential.  When discussing CBDC solutions in theory, one topic that inevitably arises is privacy. But maintaining individuals’ right to privacy will not be as challenging in practice due to the role that commercial banks will play in the CBDC ecosystem. Especially for retail CBDCs, commercial banks will very likely hold users’ wallets — and because those institutions already follow responsible user design through their extensive know-your-customer/anti-money laundering, or KYC/AML, processes, they will be well equipped to help maintain high standards of user privacy while also preventing illicit activity. A trusted third party maintaining custody of retail wallets could also offer additional user confidence, thereby benefiting adoption as well.  The opportunities of CBDCs are nearly limitless but ultimately, mainstream adoption hinges upon their usability by both individuals and businesses. Even with the “technology” and “policy” pillars in place, CBDC success in retail or wholesale will depend upon its real world usability and user adoption.  While challenges exist, it is important to recognize that challenges and problems are a natural part of any technological development — the key lies in addressing these challenges effectively. Now is the time for central banks to explore these issues, and along with the private sector, develop common solutions and ensure that the next evolution of money benefits more people and businesses and makes the world better.",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,James Wallis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/10/17/ripple-vp-the-policy-considerations-justifying-the-implementation-of-cbdcs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e1eab6d7e748fc756db40b1800a104a28e282b52-1046x686.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Democratic Rep. Greg Vitali in June announced a plan to introduce the Cryptocurrency Energy Conservation Act specifically to impose the ban.  ""The crypto mining industry is a massive energy user,"" Vitali said at the time. ""Globally, crypto mining consumes more energy than the countries of Argentina and Australia. This high level of energy usage places more stress on the environment and accelerates the climate crisis, in addition to raising costs for consumers.""  But on Monday, he tabled the bill to the state House of Representatives' Environmental Resources and Energy Committee without the moratorium. Both the bill and the amendment were accepted by the committee – which he chairs – with the bill making it through by a margin of one vote.  Vitali told the Pennsylvania Capital Star on Monday that he'd learned the hard way that ""there is not a high tolerance for strong environmental policy,"" and that he stripped the moratorium to give the bill a chance to make it to the House.  Now the moratorium is gone, the bill sets reporting requirements for certain crypto-mining facilities and calls for an impact study from the Department of Environmental Protection.  U.S. lawmakers are increasingly wary of crypto mining and its energy implications, and New York imposed a two-year moratorium on new mining facilities last year. Miners, meanwhile, are lobbying for friendlier policies in Washington DC.

A recent report unveils fascinating insights into SHIB’s price action, highlighting both optimism and caution in equal measure. SHIB, currently priced at $0.00000705 according to CoinGecko, has exhibited remarkable resilience in the face of adversity. Over the past 24 hours, it faced a modest 0.9% decline, while the seven-day dip amounted to 1.6%. However, the most intriguing aspect of SHIB’s journey lies in its confrontation with a critical resistance level. Related Reading: XRP On The Cusp Of Redemption? Unveiling Data-Backed Insights Recent market analysis reveals that SHIB is engaged in a fierce struggle with the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a pivotal indicator for deciphering bullish or bearish trends in the world of cryptocurrencies. This battle has not gone unnoticed by traders, who are eagerly awaiting the outcome. Bulls Vs. Bears: The SHIB Tug Of War SHIB’s recent price action indicates a tug of war between bears and bulls, with the cryptocurrency precariously perched at a crucial resistance level. Should SHIB manage to conclusively close above this level, traders and investors could witness the resurgence of bullish momentum. SHIB market cap currently at $4.16 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com While SHIB enthusiasts are buoyed by the positive signs on the chart, there is one conspicuous element causing concern—the declining trading volume. A reliable rule of thumb in crypto markets is that a cryptocurrency battling significant resistance, like the 21-day EMA, should ideally be accompanied by surging trading volumes. Related Reading: XRP Path To Recovery: Will $0.5 Be Conquered? Increasing volumes signify robust buying interest and provide substantial validity to price movements.

SHIB price action in the last week. Source: Coingecko What Lies Ahead For SHIB? The Shiba Inu community eagerly watches as their beloved cryptocurrency navigates these challenging waters. The battle with resistance and the conundrum of decreasing trading volumes offer mixed signals, making it imperative for investors to exercise caution. SHIB’s journey remains one of unpredictability and volatility. Only time will reveal whether the recent breakthrough will pave the way for a lasting bullish trend or if caution will be the name of the game. In the ever-changing world of cryptocurrencies, one thing is certain: Shiba Inu continues to be a captivating, enigmatic player in the digital asset landscape. As the market closely monitors these developments, the importance of tracking both technical indicators and market sentiment becomes increasingly apparent for traders and investors alike.

The consumer spending figure will reveal how consumers are coping with elevated borrowing costs in the economy and likely influence the U.S. dollar index, which has historically had a bearing on the crypto market.  The U.S. Census Bureau will release the September retail sales report on Tuesday, October 17, at 12:30 GMT. Economists expect a month-on-month gain of 0.3% in September following August's 0.6% increase, according to FXStreet. The core figure (exclusive of the automobile sector) is forecast to have risen 0.2% following August's 0.6% rise.  Analysts at ING expect the dollar to come under pressure on a potential softer retail sales figure. The weakness in the dollar could translate into higher prices for bitcoin and other risk assets.  The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, has surged by 6.7% in the past three months, mainly based on the U.S. economic outperformance story.

42419435,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUETb3,1697536800,SBF Trial: Nishad Singh Felt ‘Suicidal’ in Crypto Exchange’s Final Days,"“I was blindsided and horrified.”  That’s how Nishad Singh recalled feeling after a fateful September 2022 meeting with FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried where his boss laid bare the full scope of the exchange’s financial problems. Singh was the head of engineering at FTX before it imploded in November 2022 and lost billions of dollars worth of its users’ funds.  Singh told a jury on Monday that his September meeting with Bankman-Fried was the first time he realized that Alameda, FTX’s sister trading firm, had spent billions of dollars of FTX user deposits, and had left a gaping hole in both companies’ balance sheets.  “I felt betrayed,” said Singh.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  Singh is a key witness in the government’s case against Sam Bankman-Fried, and – like other star witnesses – he’s pleaded guilty to a slate of fraud and conspiracy charges that he says he committed hand-in-hand with the FTX founder. Singh told the jury he was driven by purpose in building FTX, but he realized after his meeting with Bankman-Fried that “five years of blood, sweat, and tears turned out to be for something evil.”  Monday’s testimony from Singh was perhaps the strongest evidence yet from prosecutors that Bankman-Fried was the key decision maker at FTX, and the main culprit behind the firm’s alleged crimes.  Singh was, by his own admission, culpable for much of what went wrong at FTX. He admitted to making key changes to FTX’s code that gave Alameda special privileges. Once he eventually became privy to the firms’ theft of FTX user funds in September 2022, he stayed on with the company even as it made more big expenditures and courted investors to plug the hole in its balance sheet.  In presenting Singh’s testimony – and to portray Bankman-Fried as the key wrongdoer who helmed FTX – prosecutors leaned into Singh’s apparent knack for storytelling. In addition to an admitted co-conspirator, Singh – according to his and the government’s telling – was himself a sort of tragic victim of the Bankman-Fried saga.  When Singh recounted the time he confronted Bankman-Fried on the balcony of their Bahamas apartment, prosecutors splashed an image on the screen of the FTX team’s Caribbean rooftop balcony and its sparkling swimming pool at dusk – when Singh said the conversation took place.  Singh and other top FTX/Alameda executives noticed a shortfall in FTX’s balance sheet two months earlier, and they’d grown more worried in the time since. “Caroline is really freaked out,” Singh recalled telling Bankman-Fried, “and so am I.” According to Singh, his boss eventually revealed that FTX had borrowed around $13 billion but only had $5 billion on-hand to pay back depositors.  Afterwards, when Singh asked exactly “how much are we short?” Bankman-Fried apparently retorted that this was “the wrong question.” The right question? “How can we deliver?”  “Jesus f’ing Christ,” Singh recalled saying in response.  “This has cost 5-10% of my productivity… for the last year,” Bankman-Fried said, referring to the shortfall, according to Singh. Singh recalled feeling more concerned, responding “this is going to be doing a lot more damage to me.”  Singh said he agreed to stay on at FTX despite his misgivings about its use of customer deposits – swayed by Bankman-Fried’s insistence that his friend and deputy was instrumental to FTX’s operations and uniquely positioned to aid in its survival. “How could I live with myself if my departure precipitated a fall that could’ve been avoidable?” Singh reflected.  Singh recounted several more confrontations with Bankman-Fried – these centering around the firm’s continued use of FTX user funds on expenditures which were, in Singh’s view, unnecessary.  Like Ellison, who sobbed as she recounted FTX’s final days, Singh’s testimony veered darker as he played through the events of November 2022 – when FTX ultimately collapsed.  As his testimony closed, Singh remarked on the heavy toll that the FTX saga took on his mental health: “I had been suicidal for some days.”  Campaign finance  While Bankman-Fried isn’t charged with campaign finance violations or defrauding the Federal Election Commission in this trial, prosecutors have spent quite a bit of time demonstrating the evidence they have toward that charge – first with former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, and again Monday with Singh.  Monday’s testimony, however, is the first to really demonstrate the extent to which Bankman-Fried (allegedly) had a sophisticated operation for funneling money to political candidates and causes. Singh testified that there was a group chat, where hired political consultants made recommendations on where to move funds. Ryan Salame, the former FTX Digital Markets CEO who pleaded guilty to campaign finance charges last month, executed wire transfers from Singh’s account at Prime Trust (which he repeatedly referred to as a bank account, even though Prime Trust wasn’t a bank) to move the funds to recipients.  Singh also testified that he signed literal “blank checks” from his Wells Fargo account, which he sent to Gabriel Bankman-Fried (Sam’s brother) through an assistant. These checks would be signed in bulk by Singh, and distributed by Gabriel Bankman-Fried to choice political causes.  Sam Bankman-Fried also funded Guarding Against Pandemics, the political action committee his brother ran, Singh said.  Prosecutors said in August they folded campaign finance allegations into a wire fraud charge that Bankman-Fried already faces, after having to drop an explicit campaign finance-related charge due to extradition treaty obligations with the Bahamas.  — Sam Kessler, Nikhilesh De  Courtroom scenes  Bankman-Fried continued tapping away at his laptop Monday. During one section of Singh’s testimony, the former head of product described a conversation he had with Bankman-Fried, where the then-FTX CEO was angry with Singh, saying there were certain physical tics that indicated Bankman-Fried’s anger: Bankman-Fried “puffed out his chest, had his hands back, he was … closing his eyes, grinding his teeth and when he opened them to respond he would sort of glare at me.” The defendant did not look up during this part.  Sam Bankman-Fried’s parents looked anxious when Singh testified about the campaign finance scheme, a reporter for another outlet who was in the courtroom told CoinDesk. (Our reporters were all in the courthouse overflow room at the time.)  Judge Lewis Kaplan rejected the defense’s motion to either adjourn court temporarily or administer Sam Bankman-Fried his prescription Adderall for ADHD, saying he had not received any recent reports from physicians on Bankman-Fried’s needs. “I can’t have lawyers coming in and giving drugs to people on trial because somebody says they need it,” the judge said.  This CoinDesk reporter was seen frantically digging through his backpack for a pen after the one he was using ran dry, the second in as many weeks to die in service of covering this trial.  — Nikhilesh De  What we're expecting  The prosecution wrapped up its questioning of Singh at the end of the trial day on Monday, meaning the defense team will open up Tuesday with its cross-examination of the former product lead. We also heard from Tareq Morad, an FTX customer, on Monday, meaning several others named last Friday have yet to testify.  We otherwise still seem to be on track for the DOJ resting its case by Oct. 26 (next Thursday). The defense continues to estimate that its case will take about a week and a half, suggesting that we may move to closing statements by Nov. 7 or 8.  Bankman-Fried also can’t bring up the success of his investment in the company Anthropic during the trial, Judge Kaplan said in a written ruling published after Monday’s court session. Last week, the judge likened the plan to boasting about spending stolen funds on a winning Powerball lottery ticket.  — Nikhilesh De",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,"Sam Kessler, Nikhilesh De",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/17/sbf-trial-ftx-exec-felt-suicidal-in-crypto-exchanges-final-days,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84d3ca7ee2a1134decf42c38bcf6e637ea645d1f-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42419434,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUETa1,1697536800,EU Regulator Warns of ‘Opaque’ Crypto Firms as It Seeks to Close MiCA Loopholes,"European Union regulators on Tuesday warned that “complex and opaque” global crypto companies could try to exploit differences among member states, saying that some may try to operate from overseas via EU-based shells even after its landmark Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA) takes effect.  The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) on Tuesday told major global crypto firms to start preparing for MiCA now, even as national regulators race to design the procedures that will let exchanges and wallet providers gain a coveted crypto license.  MiCA license rules take effect in December 2024, but companies can continue operating without a full license until July 2026 if they are registered under an existing, lighter-touch national money laundering regimes – as has been done by the likes of Binance in France and Coinbase in the Netherlands.  ESMA officials are now worried that the interim provision could confuse customers MiCA is seeking to aid, and allow companies to exploit differences among national regulators.  “Opaque group structures may also render it difficult for clients of service providers to know which entity they are dealing with and its regulatory status,” ESMA said in a statement today, adding that some existing crypto companies “may lack a strong compliance culture … and their large scale and geographic scope allow them to maintain a high level of agility in terms of where they can operate, increasing the risk of conflicts of interest, regulatory arbitrage and an unlevel playing field.”  National regulators, who will, in practice, implement the rules, should “​​prevent the establishment of so-called ‘letterbox’ entities” that allow foreign providers to operate in the bloc without having real staff or substantial operations there.  In principle, MiCA sets the same rules across the bloc, allowing companies to do business with a single license – but it also offers some leeway for national regulators in how to apply transitional measures, or how to define an exception for decentralized networks.  That has, in turn, raised fears that some countries could seek to undercut the rules to boost their competitiveness – and ESMA Chair Verena Ross has already said she doesn’t want to see “forum shopping” to find the laxest jurisdiction. Last year, EU lawmakers’ attention turned to countries such as Cyprus, whose regulator had approved FTX to operate within the bloc before its November 2022 collapse.  Though final MiCA rules aren’t yet nailed down – meaning that in many cases, crypto firms won’t be able to apply for licenses yet – ESMA urged them to start informing regulators and clients of their intentions, and also called on regulators to finalize procedures as a matter of urgency.  National authorities should “establish authorization procedures and foster dialogue with potential applicants as soon as possible,” ESMA said, raising the prospect that there could be some kind of informal pre-screening process even before companies make formal license applications.  ESMA began consulting on detailed MiCA rules in July, with Ross warning that there’d be “no such thing as a safe crypto-asset” even after the rules take effect.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/17/eu-regulator-warns-of-opaque-crypto-firms-as-it-seeks-to-close-mica-loopholes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7d5bf6cca518e2c8cb5a2c0836821e8233da851a-1257x707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

18956454,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555701,1697535934,Crypto Research Firm Predicts 200% XRP Price Rally To $1.5,"As the XRP price and its future trajectory continue to be a hot topic for debate, crypto research firm Sistine Research has weighed in on this debate using technical analysis. XRP holders are set to love this one, as their prediction is bullish. Where Is XRP Price Headed? In a post shared on the X (formerly Twitter) platform, Sistine Research stated that, despite the current market outlook, XRP is one of the tokens with a bullish chart in the crypto market as of now. Related Reading: How Ripple’s Rumored Token Burn Could Affect The XRP Price Their bullish sentiment was projected in their post, which contained a weekly chart that suggested an accumulated pattern since May 2022, with the XRP price having the potential to rally to as high as $1.5, an over 200% increase from its current price of $0.49. Source: X The research firm also used the XRP/Bitcoin chart to further drive home their bullish sentiment. The chart showed XRP’s potential to outperform the flagship cryptocurrency with its projected rally to $1.5. However, it seems that the XRP price could decline to the $0.40 support level before any massive rally. Source: X Clarification On The Charts Sensing that there was some form of skepticism from many in the crypto community, Sistine Research released a subsequent post where it further elaborated on its technical analysis. It explained that from the charts, it was evident that there is a long-term accumulation that is trending upwards. According to them, during this period, buyers are willing to dive into the market and provide support to the token at higher and higher prices, likely suggesting that a potential retracement or dump by the bears doesn’t faze the bulls. Sistine alluded to the fact that the most recent pump on the chart was larger than the previous pump. This supposedly shows that buyers are active as they are still accumulating at higher prices rather than waiting for a decline before going in. While all this is happening, sellers are still holding their tokens as they anticipate higher prices before selling. Related Reading: What To Expect This Month For XRP Price According To Historical Data They compared this XRP chart to the BTC chart in 2018, when buyers got weaker, and sellers had control of the market, selling every pump at lower prices. The research firm also suggested that DOGE’s chart is currently experiencing something similar (to the 2018 BTC chart) as they stated that the XRP price chart is “objectively bullish” in comparison to the meme coin, which is “exhibiting major signs of buyer exhaustion.” As of the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at $0.49, around 0.30% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a crypto licensing bill on Friday, set to take effect in July 2025, in a move that could help benefit crypto businesses in the state and likely aid long-term industry growth.  Bulls seemed unfazed by the fake reports of BlackRock’s (BLK) spot bitcoin ETF being approved, which led to massive price volatility on Monday and saw bitcoin whipsaw to $30,000 and down to $27,900 before settling. Meanwhile, in a FOX Business interview, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said the rally was suggestive of the ""pent up interest in crypto.""  ""I think there's more people running into a flight to quality, whether that is in Treasuries, gold or crypto, depending on how you think of it. And I believe crypto will play that type of role, as a flight to quality,"" Fink said.

Solana’s SOL jumped 6% to lead gains among crypto majors, while XRP and Cardano’s ADA lost as much as 0.3%.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a broad-based tracker of hundreds of tokens, popped 1.24%.  Tokens of popular decentralized exchange Uniswap (UNI) slipped 3% as traders reacted to the platform introducing a 0.15% swap fee for each trade made – which invoked mixed reactions among industry watchers on social app X.  Some market analysts said the appeal of crypto investing remained among investors, citing risk against reward opportunities.  “Relative to other assets, the risk vs. reward (or upside vs. downside) of crypto looks much better relative to other asset classes,” said Solo Cessay, co-founder of social app Calaxy, in a note to CoinDesk. “Crypto looks like it has the best upside vs. downside potential, given the current asset prices. Real estate, the S&P 500 - everything is still trading near all-time highs.”  Elsewhere, analysts at crypto Bitfinex shared in a weekly note that short-term bitcoin holders, or wallet addresses that move bitcoin in under six months, accounted for only 19.34% of the circulating supply, indicating a strong “holding sentiment.”  However, the Bitfinex analysts flagged market risks related to spot trading volumes on crypto hitting multi-year lows and rapidly increasing use of leverage among traders – creating a situation where prices can move quickly and cause outsized liquidations, such as those on Monday.

The recent pressures led to the breaking of a crucial support trendline associated with an ascending triangle pattern. This breach is a clear signal of potential bearishness for XRP in the near term. An ascending triangle pattern is a technical chart formation frequently observed in financial markets. This pattern suggests a potential bullish breakout and often serves as an indicator of upward momentum. In an ascending triangle, the lower trendline represents an area of support, while the upper trendline is a resistance level. The price tends to move within these boundaries, creating a triangular shape. Traders often look for a breakout above the upper trendline as a signal to go long.

Authorities have requested information on an additional 200 crypto accounts, most of which are held on Binance, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.  Since Hamas stormed into Israel 10 days ago, triggering a war and a siege of the Palestinian enclave of Gaza, Israeli law enforcement has been working with the public and crypto firms to block fund flows to the group, classified as a terrorist organization by the U.S., U.K. and many other jurisdictions worldwide.  Binance confirmed to CoinDesk last week that it was working with Israeli authorities to block terror financing. The firm told the Financial Times that it had ""blocked"" a ""small number"" of accounts on the platform, but declined to say how many.  ""We are deeply saddened by the events in the Middle East. As always, Binance follows internationally recognized sanctions rules, blocking the small number of accounts linked to illicit funds.

Staking SOL on Lido is no longer available for new users, while the front end will cease to be able to unstake existing tokens in February 2024. As of Tuesday, some $55 million worth of SOL tokens are locked on Lido, data shows, a significant slump from the April 2022 peak of $440 million.  “After much discussion and a vote by Lido DAO members, it was decided that the best course of action would be to wind down Lido on Solana,” Lido developers said in a post.  “Whilst this decision was difficult in the face of numerous strong relationships across the Solana ecosystem, it was deemed a necessity for the continued success of the broader Lido protocol ecosystem,"" developers added.  Over 92% of the Lido community voted to sunset the product instead of choosing to continue the service, a vote that ended on October 5 shows. In discussions preceding the vote, some community members pointed out that the high costs quoted by P2P developers to maintain the service were a point of contention.  DAOs, short for decentralized autonomous organizations, are a blockchain-based form of organization or company that is often governed by a native crypto token. Staking refers to locking up tokens on a protocol to help validate transactions and maintain a blockchain network in return for rewards.  A proposal floated by P2P Validator, the developers who built the product on Lido in early September, revealed that they took losses of over $480,000 in the past year against the $700,000 spent to build the product. It shared concerns about being unable to achieve objectives in the next year, citing difficult market conditions.  “Achieving even 2% of the market share in 2023-2024 seems improbable, particularly in the current Solana market, without any marketing assistance and given Lido DAO’s committee resolution 22 to discontinue all incentives in Solana,” the team’s proposal said.  P2P Validator sought funding from Lido in its proposal to continue offering the SOL staking product to users, in the absence of which it would have to sunset the product.",NEGATIVE,SOL | LDO,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL | LDO,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/17/lido-finance-sunsets-solana-staking-product-after-dao-vote,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/949b6330f0cf7aa153b49a88dba19e996a4dfaaa-6000x3375.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

18952034,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555681,1697527843,Solana (SOL) Price Primed For 50% Surge: Bullish Pattern Emerges,"Renowned crypto analyst Josh Olszewicz recently spotlighted an extremely bullish technical pattern for Solana (SOL) price, suggesting a potential significant uptrend for the cryptocurrency against the US dollar (SOL/USD). Olszewicz shared his analysis on X (formerly Twitter), commenting, “SOL iHS alert. Chart is the chart, love it or hate. Looks a helluva lot better than spot ETH that’s for sure.” Solana Poised For A 50%+ Rally? After reaching a peak of $260 in November 2021, the Solana price experienced a steep decline in value, plummeting to a low of $8 by the end of 2022. This decline mirrored the general downturn in the crypto market, which was further aggravated by the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX, with SOL being particularly affected. However, 2023 began with a positive twist for Solana. The price of SOL rebounded from its $8 low to almost $26 within the first half of January, setting the stage for the formation of an inverse head and shoulders (H&S) pattern. Related Reading: FTX Estate Stakes $122 Million Solana (SOL), Quells Fear Of Token Sell-Off This inverse H&S pattern, recognized as a typical bullish reversal signal, began taking shape in mid-January and extended through October 2023. By mid-March, the left shoulder was evident, with the head forming in early June, and the right shoulder becoming prominent in October. A significant feature of this pattern is the neckline resistance, identified at around the $25.81 mark. Solana’s price has already challenged this resistance multiple times, and a decisive breach above this threshold would serve as a strong indicator of a bullish trend reversal. Olszewicz, in his analysis, marked the stop loss (SL) for this trade idea just below the right shoulder, specifically around $19.30. Related Reading: Solana Outshines Bitcoin? A Dive Into Last Week’s Crypto Asset Inflows Using Fibonacci extensions, Olszewicz charted potential price trajectories for SOL, should it successfully surpass the $25.81 neckline. The targets are marked at the 1.618 ($33.85) and 2.0 ($38.82) Fibonacci levels. If these predictions hold, traders might be looking at potential profits ranging between 35% and 55% from the current price. VPVR Supports This Thesis For SOL Additional insights from the Volume Profile Visible Range (VPVR) reveal that the most substantial trading activity for SOL is clustered around the $14 to $15 bracket. Another volume cluster is situated between the $20.83 and $19.30 marks, aligning with Olszewicz’s stop loss placement. Another important takeaway is that should SOL break above the inverse H&S pattern’s neckline, there is a large volume gap up to the first price target at $33.85 where the 1.618 Fibonacci level is situated, suggesting this area is of significant interest and potential resistance. In conclusion, while the inverse H&S pattern’s emergence paints a super bullish picture for Solana’s price trajectory, it is essential to await a confirmed breakout above the $25.81 neckline, ideally supported by a substantial trading volume, before confirming the bullish projections laid out by Olszewicz. At press time, SOL rose above 200-day EMA and traded at $23.81.

The dominance rate rose to 52.45% on Monday, reaching the highest since April 2021, according to data tracked by the charting platform TradingView.  The ascent is consistent with the bullish breakout seen in June, which marked the end of a prolonged range play between 38% and 48%.  According to technical analysis by Fairlead Strategies, it’s likely to continue in the coming days, reversing the decline from 60% to 40% seen during the hazy crypto bull market days of March-April 2021. Investors then rotated money from the relatively expensive bitcoin into altcoins, leading to a decline in BTC's dominance rate.  ""The index is poised to extend higher, especially after resolving a two-year trading range higher this summer,"" Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner at Fairlead Strategies, said in a note to clients on Monday.  ""Our long-term trend-following indicators also support more bitcoin dominance, and there is room to the next resistance.

42419452,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUEToT,1697520875,Trading Bitcoin on Binance Got Tougher During the ETF Rumor Frenzy: Kaiko,"Binance has long been the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volumes. Still, on Monday, traders looking to buy and sell bitcoin (BTC) quickly on Binance were at a relative disadvantage to their peers on Kraken and Coinbase (COIN), according to data tracked by Paris-based Kaiko.  The 0.1% ask depth on Binance, a measure of buy-side liquidity, crashed to just 1.2 BTC ($30,000) from 100 BTC as volatility exploded after a false report of BlackRock's (BLK) spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval circulated on social media. The leading cryptocurrency popped 7.5% to $30,000 in a knee-jerk reaction to the rumor, only to give up gains after BlackRock denied the report.  The 0.1% ask depth refers to the number of outstanding purchase orders within 0.1% of the mid-price or average of the bid and ask prices. Ask price is the price at which the seller is ready to sell and bid is the value at which the buyer is ready to purchase.  The higher the bid and ask depth, the easier it is to execute large buy and sell orders at stable prices and the lower the slippage – the difference between the expected price at which a trade is placed and the actual price at which the trade goes through.  The 0.1% depth also dipped as low as 2 BTC on OKX and Bybit, with the average ask across major exchanges falling below 95 BTC.  The broad-based decline in liquidity saw several market participants, including pseudonymous traders exitpump and Omz, lose money due to slippage. Some traders saw slippage as high as 20%.  The chart shows Kraken and Coinbase outperformed Binance and other exchanges during the liquidity meltdown.  The sticky liquidity on the two exchanges likely reflects the relative sophistication of their market makers - entities tasked with creating liquidity in an order book, according to Carey.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/17/bitcoin-liquidity-on-binance-plummeted-during-the-etf-rumor-induced-market-rollercoaster-kaiko,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3bb493ad5430f73912182503114c7ab3aceba601-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $0.4915 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might continue to move down if it breaks the $0.4880 support zone. XRP Price Eyes Recovery After a steady decline, XRP found support near the $0.4730 zone. The price started a recovery wave above the $0.480 level, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move above the $0.4880 resistance. The bulls pushed it above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the main drop from the $0.5510 swing high to the $0.4730 low. Besides, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $0.4915 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair. However, the bears remained active above the $0.500 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $0.500 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.500 level. The first major resistance is near the $0.5065 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours) or the 50% Fib retracement level of the main drop from the $0.5510 swing high to the $0.4730 low. Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com A close above the $0.5065 level could send the price toward the $0.521 resistance.

If XRP fails to clear the $0.5065 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.488 zone. The next major support is at $0.4730.
