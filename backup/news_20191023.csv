42403397,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfvC2,1571866504,Blockstack's STX Token Now Traded on Binance and HashKey Pro,"Blockstack’s Stacks (STX) token can now be traded on the Binance and HashKey Pro exchanges, the company said Wednesday.  The advance is set to expand investors’ access to STX – especially in Asia, where HashKey Pro is based and Binance is well-known. Muneeb Ali, Blockstack’s CEO, called Asia a “priority region” in a company statement.  Ali told CoinDesk:  “It’s very important that we have a global network of users and investors.”  STX is used to register digital assets on the Blockstack blockchain. They are consumed when users register or utilize the something on Blockstack, much like ETH is spent when operating on the ethereum network.  The company raised $23 million in anticipation of the listing, $7.6 million of which came from Asian investors and the rest from Blockstack’s Securities and Exchange Commission-qualified July offering, Ali told CoinDesk.  Ali said that 4,500 separate investors participated in the U.S. round.  But that regulated offering has meant extra scrutiny and even set limits on how Blockstack can interact with U.S. investors. They are prohibited from buying the tokens fueling Blockstack’s 270-odd decentralized applications out of an abundance of regulatory caution, Ali said.  SEC documents released Wednesday similarly indicate that ""U.S. persons"" cannot buy, sell or trade STX on HashKey Pro or Binance.  Regulatory compliance is at the forefront of the token rollout, as is transparency, the company’s spokesperson added.  In a blog post, Blockstack pledged to release internal documents and made a list of early token backers’ wallet addresses public, so anyone can “know if and when any early backer moves their Stacks tokens.”  Ali’s wallet address is among them. He said he is in it for the long-haul but recognizes that not everyone will sit on STX forever. Said Ali:  “If any of the early backers exit, I think people should know.”  Muneeb Ali image via CoinDesk archives",POSITIVE,STX,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | BNB | STX,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/23/blockstacks-stx-token-now-traded-on-binance-and-hashkey-pro,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f2a1a6f929b7a34c9d02ccb055388219880a45bc-2560x1628.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403409,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfvLs,1571853643,Ex-Bankers Offer First Hot Wallet for Institutional-Grade Crypto Finance,"Trustology, the digital asset custody provider built by former bankers from UBS, BNY Mellon and Bank of America, has released a custodial wallet designed to brave the gamut of decentralized finance (DeFi).  The first version of the wallet, a suite of technologies called TrustVault, looked like a straightforward crypto wallet phone app, but behind the scenes, the user’s private keys were held within clusters of hardware security modules (HSMs) operated by Trustology with verification processes distributed among secure data centers. The new version works in the browser and is compatible with MetaMask.  To entice institutions to begin using decentralized exchanges, minting stablecoins via MakerDAO or lending and borrowing crypto through Compound Finance, TrustVault now bridges the browser with various decentralized apps on ethereum. It is a reaction to the plethora of cryptocurrencies available and the changing ways in which people want to access them.  “With blockchain you can come up with a new asset class with different life cycle events, different servicing actions, within hours by creating new smart contracts,” said Alex Batlin, CEO and founder of Trustology.  Earlier this year, Trustology began working with insurance broker Aon, as did custody providers Anchorage and Vo1t. “I don't believe there is anything else on the market that is custodial and DeFi-capable,” he said.  Batlin believes that when you have hundreds of smart contracts with their own method calls connecting transactions to a blockchain, it becomes a scalability problem. Web browser plug-in tools like MetaMask allow users to sign transactions with a key inside their browser without having to deal with multiple user interfaces. But having these keys in the browser is not secure, Batlin said adding:  “A lot of people have been looking for support for DeFi apps, but they have not been able to transact large values because it's too dangerous; the keys are in the browser and can easily be hacked.”  Rather than signing with a key inside the browser when the MetaMask extension pops up, the Trustology API switches to a TrustVault plug-in which handles the transaction and the user’s signature is returned to MetaMask to submit to the blockchain.  “It’s a seamless user experience. You get all the utility of accessing the hundreds of dapps out there; lending, exchanging, creating derivatives,” said Batlin, “but with all the safeguarding of the keys, KYC, AML, multi-sig as well on accounts.”  Enterprise blockchain proofs-of-concept are another interesting class of use cases, said Batlin. If Santander is issuing a bond on ethereum, for instance, typically prototyping teams will use MetaMask as part of the workflow, going to a web page to purchase the bond and sign transactions.  “Once the [proof-of-concept] part is done they have to think about how to do it in a secure way,” said Batlin, adding:  “That’s when everything falls apart. They now need to think about a wallet, how to store keys, how to do custody – and it's bloody hard work.”  Vault door image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | MKR,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/23/ex-bankers-offer-first-hot-wallet-for-institutional-grade-crypto-finance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8767541ef40c831e3791be6a137793f2785e2fd-1300x845.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403392,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfv95,1571847302,Zuckerberg: Facebook Would Quit Libra if the Association Launched Prematurely,"WASHINGTON – Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told lawmakers that the company would pull out of the Libra Association in the event the consortium launched its proposed cryptocurrency without all needed regulatory approvals.  In a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday, Zuckerberg fielded pointed questions on a variety of controversial issues around the social network, from election meddling to housing discrimination to deepfakes. But Libra, the proposed price-stable cryptocurrency Facebook conceived and set up the association to run, was the foremost item on the agenda  And many of the CEO's answers to lawmakers' questions underscored Facebook's official position is that it no longer controls the project.  Specifically, Zuckerberg reiterated his commitment to satisfying regulators' concerns before launching Libra. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.) homed in on the apparent tension between this pledge and the idea that the Libra Association is independent of Facebook, asking:  ""You said that you won't launch without U.S. regulator approval. What happens if the association decides to launch despite that?""  Zuckerberg replied to this hypothetical:  ""I believe we would be forced to leave the association.""  In such a scenario, he went on, ""I would hope that [the] association will weigh our recommendation and what we say publicly that we think should happen.  ""If we don't receive the clearances that we feel like we need to move forward and the association chooses to move forward without us then we will be in a position where we will not be a part of the association,"" said Zuckerberg.  As remote as the possibility may seem, Facebook wouldn't be the first member company to abandon Libra – Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and eBay all pulled out a few weeks ago.  When Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Missouri) asked why he thought they did so, Zuckerberg said: ""It’s a risky project.""  Anonymous wallets  Similarly, Zuckerberg committed to preventing anonymous use of the Calibra wallet – but stopped short of promising lawmakers that the Libra cryptocurrency would never be used without identification.  Noting that the House had just passed a bill to crack down on shell companies, Rep Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) asked Zuckerberg: ""Will you commit to not supporting anonymous wallets for Libra?""  At first, he answered obliquely, telling Maloney:  ""We see a range of cryptocurrencies. We are trying to build a safe and secure and regulated alternative. As a big company, we're not going to do something that’s unregulated or decentralized. We want to get to the same standard on money laundering or CFT [counter-terrorism financing].""  Unsatisfied with the answer, the lawmaker pressed him.  ""I don’t think you can have strong AML [anti-money-laundering practices] and anonymous wallets,"" Maloney said. ""I see this as a new loophole for criminals looking to hide money. Will, you commit to not having anonymous wallets? You’re creating a whole new currency that could potentially be anonymous.""  Zuckerberg answered that Calibra, the Facebook subsidiary developing a wallet for Libra, ""is going to have strong identity [verification] and work with all the regulators to make sure we’re at the standard of AML or CFT that people expect."" But he added a caveat:  ""I can’t speak for the whole association, you have my commitment from Facebook.""  Joined at the hip?  Despite Zuckerberg's comments, separating Facebook from Libra may be a challenge for the nascent association.  During the hearing, Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) said ""Facebook is Libra,"" with Zuckerberg acting as the face of the company, and therefore, the new cryptocurrency.  Her comments were echoed after the hearing by Representatives Madeleine Dean (D-Penn.) and Sylvia Garcia (D-Texas), who told a group of reporters that separating the two might be difficult.  ""[Zuckerberg] carefully called it an independent association probably five or 10 times but it doesn't mean it makes it so and I don't think it's going to be the end of it,"" Garcia said.

42403407,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfvKt,1571837172,$7.5K: Bitcoin's Price Tanks to Four-Month Low,"Bitcoin's low volatility consolidation has ended with a violent drop beyond four-month lows near $7,500.  The premier cryptocurrency fell by $500 in just 15 minutes at 12:50 UTC to hit a low of $7,500 – the lowest level since June 10, according to Bitstamp data. It is currently hovering at that price.  The global average price, as represented by CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), also hit a low of $7,549. With the price slide, BTC's market capitalization also tanked to $135 billion.  A big move was overdue as bitcoin's price volatility had dropped to a 6.5-month low of 2.58 percent earlier today, according to Coinmetrics.  The cryptocurrency was largely trapped in a trading range of $8,500 to $7,850 since the end of September. The consolidation was expected to end with a bullish breakout as technical charts were reporting signs of seller exhaustion near $7,850 – a key Fibonacci retracement level.  The range, however, has ended with a violent move to the downside, possibly due to massive long squeeze reported by @WhaleCalls. A long squeeze occurs when a drop in prices forces long holders to unwind their positions. That adds to the downward pressure, leading to a deeper price slide.  The range breakdown has exposed support at $7,430 (multiple daily lows in June). As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,600, representing a 7 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  Other cryptocurrencies are also flashing red. Names like binance coin and litecoin are reporting 8 percent drop and ether, XRP and bitcoin cash are shedding 6-7 percent, according to CoinMarketCap.

42403396,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfvE0,1571832023,PeerNova Validates Shift to Enterprise Blockchain With $31 Million Funding,"Blockchain startup PeerNova has received $31 million in a Series B round, bringing the company’s total fundraising to $74 million.  Mosaik Partners led the latest investment, joined by Intuitive Venture Partners and Medici Ventures, the investing arm of retail giant Overstock, the company said.  PeerNova declined to disclose any further financial details of the deal.  The sizable funding validates the one-time bitcoin mining company’s shift to the enterprise blockchain designed to improve data reporting processes for financial services companies.  “It has been much harder for blockchain companies in the last 12 months to go raise capital,” PeerNova’s CEO Gangesh Ganesan told CoinDesk. “The fact that we raised a big around is an indication of investors’ confidence in our model.”  In addition to new hires for its U.S. and London operations, the company has been negotiating with local financial authorities to open an office in Singapore as many of its clients have businesses in Asia, Ganesan said.  San Jose-based PeerNova started off as a bitcoin mining company through a merger in 2014 between cloud mining firm CloudHashing and enterprise hardware designer HighBitcoin.  The company shifted its focus from mining infrastructure services to enterprise blockchain software with a $8.6 million Series A funding later in the same year. Mosaik Partners, former AOL CEO Steve Case and Crypto Currency Partners invested in this round.  The company uses proprietary blockchain technology to reduce reporting inefficiencies by replacing traditional auditors with cryptography.  Unlike most peer blockchain solutions, PeerNova’s product Cuneiform does not have a distributed ledger, as it only provides a reference point for a client to streamline the querying of their databases, creating cryptographic evidence of events.  The company helped financial services giant State Street with sorting tax liabilities for hedge funds by using the blockchain system to track their investments and reinvestments over multiple years.  PeerNova further developed its enterprise blockchain business with $5 million through the second tranche of the Series A financing in March 2016. The funding was also Overstock’s first investment in the bitcoin industry.  In November 2016, Chinese conglomerate Zhejiang Zhongnan Holdings Group acquired five percent of PeerNova for $4 million.

The task force will investigate digital asset labels for cryptocurrencies, tokens, and blockchain technology as it intersects with financial markets, the association said.  While most crypto exchanges use a standardized set of ticker symbols, there are some discrepancies that will need to be overcome if traditional financial exchanges are to eventually deal with digital assets. For example, bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market cap, has traditionally been labelled BTC, but more recently XBT has been used due to its similarity to gold's ticker, XAU.  Speaking on the announcement, ANNA executive director and secretariat Uwe Meyer called the task force a step forward for traditional markets recognition of the emerging asset class:  “With digital assets emerging as a new investment class, the availability of quality, standardised reference data will serve as the foundation for a trusted token market … This evaluation process on digital assets is an important part of that journey.”  Financial data ticker image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/23/securities-numbering-body-launches-task-force-to-standardize-digital-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27632e2e86d21bbc3a496c9b1823d3f70e8207db-1500x949.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The news was announced by Emanuel Cleaver, II, congressman for Missouri’s fifth district, on Tuesday. Cleaver said he'd written to the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), and the Office of Financial Research (OFR) in August calling on the regulators to ""proactively examine Libra and Calibra for possible systemic risk.""  Cleaver received a letter from back from the Treasury yesterday, confirming that there are many ""unanswered questions"" over Libra. The department said that as Congress ""continues to examine these issues"" it would ""closely monitor this market to address any regulatory gaps that it identifies.""  The Treasury added:  “It is unclear whether U.S. and foreign regulators will have the ability to monitor the Libra market and require corrective action, if necessary. This concern must be addressed if the Libra is to launch.”  With Facebook's global reach, Cleaver argued it's ""absolutely critical"" that the project be ""stringently"" examined to ensure the cryptocurrency ""does not pose a systemic risk to the global economy.”  While he applauded Facebook's efforts to work with regulators on Libra concerns, Cleaver said it has ""the potential to update – or upend – our financial system.""  ""As Facebook works down this regulatory road, it is imperative that we affirm that terror financing and money laundering is not advanced through Libra, and, according to FSOC, significant concerns remain,” he concluded.  The announcement came a day before Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg is set to testify before the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee over Libra and other issues.

Even so, the outlook remains neutral as key Fibonacci retracement support at $7,850 is still intact.  Bitcoin's volatility gauge has dropped to the lowest level in over six months. The low volatility period will likely end with a big move on the higher side, as a repeated defense of $7,850 is indicating seller exhaustion.  A UTC close above $8,820 is needed to confirm a bullish reversal.  A high-volume move below $7,850 would confirm range breakdown. However, an impending death cross, a bearish but contrary indicator, suggests the downside, if any, could be limited around $7,400.      Bitcoin's struggle for clear directional bias looks set to end, with volatility hitting multi-month lows and the charts suggesting a big move could soon occur on the higher side.  The top cryptocurrency by market value has spent a better part of the last four weeks trading the range of $7,800 to $8,400.  A double bottom breakout on Oct. 9 had raised hopes of a move above $9,000. The ascent, however, stalled $8,820 on Oct. 11 following which prices fell back to $7,800.  Further, the cryptocurrency failed to draw bids above $8,300 over the last two days despite the bullish setup on intraday charts and retreated back to $7,920 during the Asian trading hours today.  With the lackluster price action, bitcoin's 60-day daily return volatility, as calculated by Coinmetrics, has dropped to 2.58 percent – the lowest level since April 1.  The volatility gauge topped out above 5.5 percent in July and has been on a steady decline ever since, as seen in the chart below.  An extended period of low volatility often paves the way for a big move on either side.  For instance, the 60-day volatility topped out at 5 percent in early January and fell to 2 percent on April 1 – a day before BTC broke in a bull market with a $1,000 rally to $5,000. Going back further, volatility has bottomed out quite a few times near or below 2 percent.  BTC, therefore, could soon adopt a strong directional bias. The risks are skewed in favor of a bullish move, according to technical charts.  Weekly chart  Bitcoin dived out a contracting triangle in the last week of September, signaling a continuation of the pullback from June's high of $13,880.  The ensuing sell-off, however, ran out of steam near $7,850 – the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $3,122 to $13,880 – over the last three weeks.  The repeated defense of the Fibonacci support indicates seller exhaustion. The indicators on the three-day chart are also echoing similar sentiments, as discussed on Tuesday.  BTC, therefore, could see a strong bounce, possibly to levels above $8,820 (Oct. 11 high) in the short term. That would invalidate the lower highs setup on the daily chart and open the doors for resistance at $9,320.  As of now, BTC is changing hands at $7,970 on Bitstamp, representing a 2.8 percent loss on a 24-hour basis.  The outlook would turn bearish if prices drop below $7,850 with strong volumes, confirming a range breakdown.  Even so, a big sell-off, similar to the $2,000 drop seen in September, looks unlikely, and the downside could be restricted near $7,430 (multiple daily lows in early June), as a contrary indicator is about to turn bearish, as seen below.  Daily chart  The impending death cross, a bearish crossover of the 50- and 200-day moving averages, has trapped sellers on the wrong side of the market in the past.  For instance, BTC had bottomed out near $220 with the confirmation of the death cross in mid-September 2015. Notably, the bear trap was formed 11 months ahead of the August 2016 mining reward halving – a price-bullish event.  Interestingly, the latest death cross is happening six months ahead of the reward halving and could mark a bottom in BTC.

42403403,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfvGx,1571826621,Regulate Stablecoins – Don't Squash Them,"Nathan Kaiser is a founder of Eiger Law and a fellow at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. He has two decades of professional experience in Greater China focusing on corporate law and the convergence between technology and law.  The views expressed here are his own.      Recent developments with blockchain-based payments systems and stablecoins have invited close scrutiny from government regulators and policymakers. While some of these projects get headlines, policymakers should take note of the People’s Bank of China proposal for a digital currency backed by the yuan that could be used across major payment platforms such as WeChat and Alipay.  Global competition for the next wave of financial innovation is heating up. China, South Korea, Japan and much of Europe have moved fast to embrace mobile wallets and contactless payments through credit cards and other smart devices. Commoditization of mobile devices across Africa, the Middle East, and Asia brings the hope of new capabilities and economic empowerment opportunities for unbanked and underserved consumers and businesses.  Consumers see financial innovation as a means to break down legacy inefficiencies, increase access and lower the cost of financial services. While cryptocurrencies have mainly been vehicles for financial speculation because of their significant volatility, new stablecoins move closer to meeting consumer demands for more secure and faster transaction options. The value to underserved populations is evident from the potential utility and ease of use that specialized financial services products built off innovations such as stablecoins could offer.  However, people are still concerned with protecting their funds, controlling their data, and handling disputes. It is thus in the interests of the major developed economies of the world to help shape the regulatory framework around financial innovations to address compliance and consumer protection concerns.  That is what a number of international regulators and supranational bodies such as the IMF, G20, and FATF regularly address issues surrounding new mechanisms or innovations on the cusp of becoming consumer products.  Promise and peril  The G7 working group report on stablecoins published last week makes clear that consumer participation in financial services is rapidly changing and that innovation will continue to expand. The report shows that financial overseers understand the need for a viable framework for these new, ambitious projects that seek to transform digitally native interactions with money and value. It foresees a strong role for the public and private sectors in innovation to reduce friction and recognizes the considerable network effects that private mobile networks have already achieved to bring down the cost and increase reliability and speed of payments.  The report also articulates regulators’ concerns that will need to be satisfied with regard to the potential for market manipulation, the risks stable coins pose to legacy financial systems, and the lack of a clear global regulatory framework. The fear is that stablecoin systems – while decentralized by design and transparently governed by a collection of companies and non-profits, and that abide by the rules and regulations set forth by the U.S. Congress and the international community – could undermine the banking system, embolden money launderers, or cause cracks in the global monetary system.  The potential loss of government sovereignty over currency and monetary policy is also a key concern for some policymakers. They should examine whether that is really going to be the case and also consider the potential benefits of stablecoins pegged to G7 currencies like the dollar, euro or yen that enhance the utility and efficiency of these major currencies globally – as opposed to, say, a yuan-backed stablecoin that extends China’s influence across the global economy and financial system.  Just as changing consumer habits across the technology and financial services landscape have pushed companies to reimagine how the global economy buys and sells goods and services, the intense public scrutiny of stablecoins is now pushing organizations developing these systems to ensure appropriate regulation. They will need to collaborate with government bodies to ensure any new system is safe, secure, and complementary to the existing financial system.  Likewise, regulators should offer a path for stablecoins to exist alongside current financial systems and under regulatory environments. And elected officials and policymakers should give regulators time and space to formulate a regulatory environment, allowing oversight agencies around the world to ensure a globally consistent approach.

42403404,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfvHw,1571823047,What to Expect When Facebook's Zuckerberg Defends Libra on Capitol Hill,"Once again, Facebook will face the fire on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, with the Libra cryptocurrency project taking center stage.  Mark Zuckerberg, the social media giant's founder and CEO, will testify before the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, arguing that Libra will benefit unbanked individuals and that the U.S. should allow Libra to launch. He'll also be defending his company's recent record on discrimination, among other issues.  And as with Libra's previous trip to the Hill, lawmakers are expected to focus more on Facebook the company than the cryptocurrency project it is leading.  Perianne Boring, president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, told CoinDesk that Facebook was the ""predominant focus"" during previous hearings around Libra, when Facebook's blockchain lead David Marcus testified before the House Financial Services and the Senate Banking Committees.  Indeed, in prepared remarks published Tuesday, Zuckerberg acknowledged this distrust of Facebook, writing, ""I’m sure people wish it was anyone but Facebook putting this idea forward.""  ""The temptation to continue to focus on those past problems may be too great to overcome for some,"" Boring said.  Still, Zuckerberg is expected to argue that Libra can help provide financial services to 1.7 billion unbanked individuals worldwide, allowing for fast and inexpensive international remittances. He will further pushs back against the idea that Libra might displace central banks or disrupt existing monetary policy.  Early trials  It has been just four months since Libra was first unveiled. In June, Facebook announced its vision for a cryptocurrency that could seamlessly transact through its existing messaging platforms, as well as third-party wallets. Libra would be overseen by a governing council dubbed the Libra Association, as a way of ensuring that Facebook wasn't the only entity running the project.  Initially, Facebook announced that 28 companies would act as ""founding"" partners for the Association, including its subsidiary Calibra and Breakthrough Initiatives, a venture capital fund that has Zuckerberg on its board. However, seven of these companies – PayPal, Stripe, Visa, Mastercard, Booking Holdings, Mercado Pago and eBay – dropped out before the association was formally created.  Stripe, Visa and Mastercard in particular saw pressure from lawmakers to quit the project, after Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) wrote each of their CEOs identical letters warning of potentially increased regulatory scrutiny over their actions should they continue participating in Libra.  The remaining 21 companies, which don't include Facebook itself, signed the charter last week, though the association plans to grow to 100 members before Libra itself launches.  In order to launch, Zuckerberg wrote Tuesday, regulators must be satisfied that the cryptocurrency is not a threat to fiat currencies or the global financial system.  Libra will have to assure not only U.S. legislators and regulators, but also international policymakers, after French and German ministers warned that they would seek to block the cryptocurrency from launching within their jurisdictions.  It remains unclear what specifically lawmakers will ask at Wednesday's hearing, with at least one Congresswoman, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) soliciting possible questions on Tuesday night. During the previous hearings, representatives asked Marcus a wide variety of questions, ranging from security features with Libra's underlying programming language to how Libra would differ from old company scrips.  Legislative flak  While Wednesday's questions are likely to revolve around Facebook's past actions with regard to data privacy and fair practices, what lawmakers ask could present an image of how they are approaching the cryptocurrency space more broadly.  Still, the backlash to Libra could have far-reaching consequences. Representatives on the Financial Services Committee proposed new legislation Tuesday which would classify ""managed stablecoins"" as securities under the Securities Act of 1933.  The proposed legislation would specifically target a stablecoin whose value is pegged to a ""pool or basket of assets"" that are managed or otherwise held by one or more individuals.  Libra is intended to be a stablecoin, with its value underpinned by a basket of fiat currencies (though it recently conceded it might have to change that model).  The draft bills suggested by the Financial Services Committee on Tuesday seem geared toward curbing innovation, according to Boring, who said:  ""What we would like to see is a more circumspect approach considering the importance of technological advancements, Libra being one but there are many others, thinking through the considerations outlined in the G7 Working Group on Stablecoins report, and developing a strategy for moving the U.S. forward so that it continues to lead in technological innovation.""

42387636,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQlwUD,1571819410,Former World Gold Council Exec Develops New Bitcoin ETF,"The former managing director of the World Gold Council and the portfolio manager behind SPDR Gold Shares Jason Toussaint is developing a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with boutique asset manager Kryptoin Investment Advisors.  The Delaware-based firm has filed an initial registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The fund, in development for two years, would track the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate to reflect bitcoin’s actual market price. While declining to disclose the fund's management fees, the filing said it will process creations and redemptions, and accrue its management fee solely in bitcoin.  In an exclusive interview with CoinDesk, Toussaint, who is also Kryptoin's head of exchange-traded products, said:  “The benefits and challenges, when it comes to bitcoin as an asset class, are similar to what they were when the Gold Council brought SPDR Gold Shares to the market. There was also a lot of learning the SEC had to go through to fully understand and gain a level of comfort with the underlined gold market.""  The industry veteran now heads the product development in the young firm. Previously, Toussaint managed SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), one of the largest gold ETFs in the world, while serving as the CEO of the World Gold Trust Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the World Gold Council. That product is now marketed by State Street Global Advisors.  Toussaint started his career in the ETF industry at Morgan Stanley where he led the MSCI index licensing businesses in Asia, after stints as a senior strategist at Northern Trust and as a portfolio manager JP Morgan.  If Kryptoin's ETF is approved by the SEC, its shares would be listed on NYSE Arca, which focuses on trading stocks and options, as opposed to the New York Stock Exchange with mostly large-cap stocks.  But an SEC-approved ETF has now become a holy grail in the nascent space, as not one offering has been greenlit by the agency.  Three proposed bitcoin ETFs were filed earlier this year: one was denied, one withdrew and one is still pending.  In a 112-page order  , the SEC rejected Bitwise’s ETF proposal on Oct. 6, noting that crypto markets are still prone to manipulation, while VanEck withdrew its bitcoin ETF application in September, even before the commission was able to render a final decision on its application.  The commission now only has one bitcoin ETF proposal currently sitting before it. That fund was filed by Wilshire Phoenix and NYSE Arca, and should receive a decision by year-end.  In for the long haul  The Kryptoin ETF is now just beginning the process, with the filing of its initial registration. Toussaint said there are two aspects that are crucial to get the SEC's approval – the information-sharing agreements and a better understanding for the SEC of how these underlying crypto markets work.  “The biggest factor, in my mind, is the information-sharing agreement between the ETFs and underlying exchanges,"" he said.  Toussaint's experience with the first gold ETF is informing their strategy.  Bitcoin has met resistance from the regulators, just as the gold ETF did, he said, in the sense that non-publicly listed securities underlying an ETF structure that requires exchanges, gold and crypto, to be more transparent with their financial pricing, volume and other transaction data.  The firm is also keeping a close eye on maturing bitcoin futures contracts in hopes that the markets would be more resilient to manipulation.  Generally, as the market matures, both in the futures and spot markets, the regulators would be more positive about a bitcoin ETF, Toussaint said, but noted that the process could take a long time.  “This is not another S&P ETF. We are in this [process] for the long haul,” he said. ""Of course, we want to get it approved as soon as possible, but the firm is realistic, in terms of its expectations, given the recent comments through the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF order.""  Beside the underlying bitcoin asset, the SEC is generally cautious about volatility, in general.  Kostya Etus, a portfolio manager at CLS Investments, said:  “The challenge of launching a bitcoin ETF comes full circle in trying to have regulators be comfortable enough with it to approve it for investment by that wider investor base. This was a huge hurdle for leveraged and inverse ETFs, but issuers overcame that eventually, and it’s just a matter of time before they overcome this one.""  While declining to disclose further details of the firm’s legal process with the SEC, Kryptoin CEO Donnie Kim said advances in other regulatory areas are positive for their case.  “The CFTC’s approvals for bitcoin and tether to be traded on the futures markets is a good sign for us to launch the bitcoin ETF,” Kim said, referring to the once equally elusive process at the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission.

42403393,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfvA4,1571815839,ING Bank Devises Privacy Fix for R3's Corda Blockchain,"ING, the Netherlands megabank blazing a trail with extra privacy measures for enterprise blockchains, has come up with such a solution for the Corda distributed ledger system built by R3.  To be announced Wednesday at the annual developer conference CordaCon, ING has helped solve a security/privacy trade-off that currently bedevils Corda users. The bank's blockchain team did so by applying zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to the Corda notary service, the means by which the network verifies the uniqueness of transactions and prevents double-spending.  Unlike most blockchains that broadcast data among all participating nodes, R3 designed Corda to control data and limit the amount of information that needs to be shared. The Corda notary service offers a choice between using validating notaries, which can view transactions to check they are legit, and non-validating notaries which have no such visibility but instead just keep a record.  The validating notary compromises privacy by looking into the content of transactions, while the non-validating approach presents a security weakness since a malicious actor could knowingly write an invalid transaction.  If all that makes your head spin, think of being frisked and having your bag searched when entering a building compared to just signing in at the front desk. The former is intrusive for you; the latter is riskier for the building.  To thread this needle, ING has applied zero-knowledge proofs, which can prove something is true without revealing any information about it, to Corda’s validating notary function. This allows transactions to be verified without specific knowledge of their contents.  Trade finance use case  ING is addressing the privacy problem out of self-interest as it's about to start using Corda for business.  Andrei Ilchenko, the bank's global head of IT wholesale banking channels, said a number of Corda apps it has invested in, such as the trade finance projects Marco Polo and Voltron, will soon see the light of day.  These are currently relying on the non-validating notary which is hosted by Corda network, he said. But this posed risks:  “We started to notice some edge cases. For example, with Marco Polo, what would happen if there was a malicious participant to this particular business network, who would attempt to send to the non-validating notary a transaction that has an input state (e.g. an invoice) that is owned by another participant?”  Although it’s not a likely scenario, said Ilchenko, it could turn out that one party could attempt to spend some working capital and be denied.  “To resolve the matter it would need to start going to court and start running the physical world processes,” he said. But that would defeat the purpose of the blockchain. Hence the impetus to apply ZKPs.  Surprisingly fast  Normally, people think of zero-knowledge proofs as being so demanding, computationally speaking, that they slow blockchains right down. A somewhat surprising bonus discovered by ING is that ZKP transactions sent to Corda notaries take less time to verify than regular transactions (of which the entire content is visible).  Asked whether the proposed solution is for the Corda Network, the open-source community, or whether it is only being applied to the commercial version used by ING, Ilchenko said:  “Actually both. So far, the majority of CorDapps I know rely on non-validating notary run by the Corda Network Foundation and all CorDapps that ING plans to start using in production do.”  ZKPs are not the only way of solving Corda’s privacy trade-off; R3 has worked hard to modify Intel’s trusted execution environment solution SGX to fit with Corda’s requirements.  ING has worked on a range of variations of ZKPs, but always using enterprise versions of ethereum like Quorum, developed by mega-bank JPMorgan. At the start of this year, the bank started looking at applying its learnings to Corda.

42382900,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tHPp,1571803223,"Crypto Extortion on the Rise, Says Academic Study","Crypto-based extortion – basically the process of using spam-flinging botnet armies to ""ransom"" dirty pictures and compromising information in exchange for bitcoin – has turned virtual crime into child's play.  Speaking this week at the Advances in Financial Technology conference in Zurich, an international team comprised of researchers from the Austrian Technology Institute and security provider GoSecure sampled a population of email spam and found that the extortion process was quick, easy, and very lucrative.  Using public data hack info, the researchers found that a single instance of the popular Necurs botnet launched over 80 campaigns and in the 4.3 million emails surveyed by the team. In almost all cases the criminals had no incriminating information on the victims.  The team said that the botnet was surprisingly lucrative. By renting a botnet for $10,000 per month, the extortionists have been making at least $130,000. Compared to most extortion schemes, the spam campaign is incredibly simple, largely due to its employment of cryptocurrencies, said GoSecure's Masarah Paquet-Clouston.  As such, the researchers expect crypto-backed email extortions to increase.  ""If you look at traditional [product] spam, it's much more complicated ... [crypto] extortion spam is much simpler,"" Paquet-Clouston said.  Examples provided in the paper describe an email informing the victim that the hacker will release compromising personal information if bitcoin isn’t provided in a timely manner. For example, one email claimed the hackers were performing surveillance via malware:  ""Hello! As you may have noticed, I sent you an email from your account. This means that I have full access to your account. I’ve been watching you for a few months now. The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.""  Tracking the bitcoin addresses used and languages employed in emails allowed the researchers to further understand how botnets operate. For instance, whoever was behind the botnet charged certain nationalities higher prices than others, with English speakers topping out around $745 per recipient compared to Spaniards on the lowest end at $249.  The botnet reused bitcoin addresses, backing up similar research which saw one address used 3 million times. The researchers speculate address re-use is employed to increase the tactics overall simplicity.  Only 0.135 percent of bitcoin extorted could be traced to publicly verifiable wallets on exchanges, signifying the use of CoinJoins and other measures to mask transactions before off-ramping funds into fiat currency.  Knowledge about bitcoin and methods to track payments have lead botnet campaigns to other cryptos, the team said, particularly litecoin. Counterintuitively, privacy coins like monero and zcash are not being heavily used.
