42425709,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfUdh,1401230448,US Court Decision May Prompt More Mt. Gox Revival Bids,"A US bankruptcy court has rejected a filing from Seattle-based digital currency service CoinLab Inc. in the latest development in the case of failed Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.  CoinLab sought to stop investor group Sunlot Holdings from purchasing Mt. Gox in documents filed during a 27th May hearing in US Bankruptcy Court in Dallas, Texas.  According to The Wall Street Journal, CoinLab’s filing was complicated when Mt. Gox’s lawyers stated that the deal involving Sunlot had not been given any special status by the courts, and that as such, other offers regarding the ownership and management of the exchange may be considered.  Notably, the decision by Judge Stacey Jernigan could open the door to more purchase bids for Mt. Gox, including one from CoinLab itself.  Bid to stop Sunlot fails  CoinLab's filing seemingly aimed to stop or at least delay an effort by SunLot Holdings, a group of investors that includes venture capitalists John Betts and William Quigley and the Bitcoin Foundation's Industry Director-elect Brock Pierce, from purchasing Mt. Gox and its related liabilities.  In its filing, CoinLab said that Sunlot’s bid to purchase Mt. Gox was not qualified to handle the investigation required to seek the location of the failed exchange’s missing bitcoins, explaining:  ""Sunlot has made no showing of its qualifications to manage and conduct such an investigation, let alone answered pressing questions about potential conflicts of interest it has suffered or may suffer.”  Additionally, the company objected to the investor group’s plan to retain a portion of any funds recovered from Mt. Gox and its related entities during any forthcoming discovery.  New offers possible  Perhaps most notably, the courts indicated, for the first time at least explicitly, that other offers for the exchange can be considered, a statement that may lead to more investor interest in Mt. Gox.  For example, a team involved with Chinese exchange OKCoin has expressed interest in buying the defunct exchange. However, it remains unclear if the group is still actively developing an offer.  Additionally, CoinLab may ultimately submit a formal offer to purchase Mt. Gox.  In court documents, the company suggested, but stopped short of saying outright, that it would seek to buy Mt. Gox, remarking:  ""CoinLab offers a market efficiency to creditors because it can address disposition of its intellectual property rights in the exchange as well as market expertise. However, no process currently exists for competing overbids.""  Previous statements from Nobuaki Kobayashi, the Japanese bankruptcy official overseeing the case indicated earlier in the day that the Japanese courts – which will have final say on approving any measures – are not presently considering any investor proposals.

42425708,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfUfh,1401224421,Startup Accelerator Gives Boost to Bitcoin ATM Operator Liberty Teller,"Boston-based ATM network provider Liberty Teller has been one of the more high-profile local ATM operators due to its ability to place machines in notable locations such as South Station and Harvard Square, two of the metropolitan area's biggest commuter hubs.  Liberty Teller rose to prominence by taking a more guerrilla approach to distributing its Lamassu ATMs, opting to set up units without merchant partnerships and in attention-grabbing locations as a way to spread awareness about bitcoin.  This boots-on-the-ground strategy may soon be getting a boost, however, as Liberty Teller was recently accepted into the latest class of Boston-based startup accelerator MassChallenge. The class includes 128 startups from 11 countries, with the majority (32%) seeking to disrupt the high-tech industry.  However, Liberty Teller co-founder Chris Yim told CoinDesk the company is most looking forward to sharing ideas with fellow e-commerce and retail entrepreneurs as they seek to potentially expand and monetize their operation, explaining:  ""We have already signed up two MassChallenge finalists to accept bitcoin and look forward to working with the community whether it is further bitcoin integration or placing Liberty Teller kiosks at their stores.""  Yim explained that given that these startups are strapped for resources, bitcoin could help them power their operations by handling everything from payment processing to PR and marketing.  As a member of the programme, Liberty Teller will receive access to key services, such as legal advice, free work space, wireless Internet, phones and conference rooms.  MIT ambitions  Given Liberty Teller's geographic location, the company may also be in a unique position to grow its network with the help of those trying to further bitcoin's prospects at the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  The renowned university, which recently held the MIT Bitcoin Expo, holds the potential to become a large customer base for Liberty Teller, Yim said:  ""There are now a half dozen plus bitcoin-accepting merchants, a way to purchase bitcoin instantly (our Liberty Teller kiosk) and 4,500 students who will be getting bitcoin all within a few blocks of each other.""  Yim added that the company is working with members of MIT Bitcoin Club, which is set to distribute $500,000 in BTC to undergraduates this fall.  Boston strong  Liberty Teller's news comes at a time when Boston is slowly becoming a potential center for bitcoin activity. As noted by the reddit community, the combined resources of Liberty Teller's ATMs and MIT's student body could slowly turn the area into a 'Bitcoin Boulevard' of sorts.  The Netherlands' original Bitcoin Boulevard, launched this March, is reporting positive results for merchants, two months into a more cohesive project aimed at fostering broad merchant adoption.

42425715,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfUrh,1401221732,Ripple Price Rebounds After CEO Pledges 7 Billion XRP Donation,"The price of XRP is on the rise again following the resignation of a key Ripple Labs board member and subsequent charitable commitment by its CEO Chris Larsen.  Late last week, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell resigned from the board of the San Francisco-based payment network provider.  However, the decision also returned attention to a long-contentious issue surrounding the company, the allocation of large portions of Ripple's native currency – XRP – to founders.  As a result of the decision, Ripple Labs CEO Chris Larsen has committed to donate large portion of the digital currency he owns to a charitable cause.  In doing so, Larsen will also be giving 7 billion XRP back to the network, a move that at press time, seems to be fostering a positive attitude towards Ripple's market value in the community.  Price trend reverses  Last week, the price of XRP – the unit of account inside of the payment protocol of Ripple, experienced a significant drop. XRP prices fell more than 40% in value following the announcement that Ripple Labs co-founder and former CTO Jed McCaleb planned to sell his 9 billion XRP.  That large number of XRP was provided to McCaleb in the early days of the company when an initial 100 billion XRP was created, though McCaleb – the one-time owner of Mt. Gox – has left for other pursuits. The news of the large sell-off – comprising roughly 10% of the initial XRP – prompted other XRP owners to follow suit.  However, as of this writing, the price of ripple is up more than 20% on its top three markets.  Ripple Labs' Director of Communications Monica Long posted a statement that Larsen, the CEO, will donate 7 billion XRP to a foundation that will primarily be focused on the underbanked, a move that has perhaps helped boost investor sentiment.  According to Coinmarketcap, XRP is currently ranked sixth among distributed currencies. The total XRP in circulation is valued at more than $35m.  Executive resigns  After the abrupt news that McCaleb would sell off his share of XRP, board member Jesse Powell resigned from his position on 24th May. The CEO of the digital exchange Kraken, Powell was an early investor in Ripple Labs.  With McCaleb, Powell helped to set up the company before turning focus back to Kraken, which recently raised $5m in investor funding led by Hummingbird Ventures.  Powell has apparently been unhappy regarding the large allocations of XRP given to Ripple Labs' founders, writing in his resignation post:  ""Unfortunately, unlike the founders, I don’t have swathes of XRP to dump if I don't think it's working out.""  Legal fights begin  Ripple Labs, via general counsel George Frost, then sent a cease-and-desist letter to Powell after his resignation. The letter asked Powell to retract the allegedly defamatory statements in his resignation.  ""You are using your insider knowledge to sabotage Ripple Labs and wrest large payments for yourself and McCaleb,"" Frost declared in the document.  Instead of a retraction, Powell expressed his frustration by annotating the document, which has since surfaced on reddit.  In the full posting, Powell alleges that billions in XRP were given to Ripple Labs' founders without board approval.  Yet, Powell remained propitiatory in his public reply to Frost's letter. As an early investor in Ripple Labs, he indicates a desire for its long-term success:  ""I certainly have an interest, and I am rooting for the company’s success. I would prefer not to lose my investment.""  Ripple Labs' early days  The early incarnation of San Francisco-based Ripple Labs began back in 2011, when the startup was called OpenCoin. The project grew out of McCaleb's idea to build a digital currency that improved on bitcoin, yet catered to a similar community-oriented userbase.  This brought the interest of Powell and current chief cryptographer David Schwartz, among others.  Larsen has been with Ripple Labs since August 2012. He has helped raise VC funding for the company from the likes of Google Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed Venture Partners.  The company began giving away XRP in spring 2013 to longstanding members of the Bitcoin Talk forum. According to McCaleb's LinkedIn profile, the former CTO left Ripple Labs in July 2013.  The future  Ripple Labs has lost at least two board members in the past year: McCaleb, and now Powell, though Stanford professor Susan Athey was appointed to the board in April.  Despite recent issues among its top brass, however, Ripple Labs has been able to secure a key partnership with German bank Fidor.  This signaled the company's shift towards complete focus as a financial payment protocol, or 'rail' for institutions. Company executives told CoinDesk earlier this year that was a pivot for the company.  For more on Ripple Labs and its goals in the digital currency marketplace, read our full profile of the company.

42425707,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfUbh,1401218731,Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne Reports $1.6 Million in Bitcoin Sales,"In a new interview with FOX Business, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne has reported new bitcoin sales figures for the e-commerce giant, noting the company has processed $1.6m in purchases so far this year.  The news follows the 4th March announcement by the company that it had passed $1m in year-to-date sales, less than two months after its decision to begin accepting the alternative payment method at the start of the year.  Since becoming the first major retailer to accept bitcoin in January, Overstock and its outspoken CEO have become unlikely figureheads for the digital currency community.  Byrne was customarily optimistic about bitcoin and its prospects in his interview on the FOX program Opening Bell, stating:  ""Bitcoin is tiny at this point, but it's growing about 25% a month. In terms of actual transactions in a day, I think it's $300m a day. It's surpassing PayPal, at this point, in terms of transactions. [...] But, it is growing very quickly.""  Byrne most recently delivered the opening keynote at Bitcoin2014 in Amsterdam, where he gave an impassioned speech on the underlying economic theories supporting bitcoin.  Sales decline  If correct, the figures would seem to indicate that Overstock has seen a drop-off in bitcoin sales figures in recent months after a strong start.  While the company earned $1m in the first two months of offering the payment option, Bryne's latest comments would suggest that this figure has fallen to $600,000 in the roughly three months since, though he did not provide exact dates for either projection.  In March, Bryne revised his anticipated year-end bitcoin sales figures up from roughly $3-$5m to as high as $10-20m.  Holding BTC  Byrne also confirmed that his company is still holding 10% of its BTC sales earnings in the digital currency, a fact he first revealed in March.  The reiteration of the company policy comes at a time when critics in the traditional financial community have taken issue with the notion that Overstock is accepting bitcoin by working with and receiving fiat currency from California-based merchant processing service provider Coinbase.

42425713,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfUph,1401216316,Arnhem Becomes Second Dutch City to Host a 'Bitcoin Boulevard',"Fifteen of Arnhem’s local bars, restaurants and cafes will begin accepting bitcoin tomorrow, 28th May.  The Arnhem Bitcoinstad – or Bitcoincity – is a one-day event during which bitcoiners can pay for food and drink using their digital currency, and meet like-minded people looking to do the same. A bitcoin ATM will also be installed specially for the day in case folks need to reload their wallets.  Located roughly an hour and a half from Amsterdam, Arnhem is the capital of the Gelderland province in the east of the country.  This event is being organized by three bitcoin enthusiasts: Rogier Eijkelhof, Patrick van der Meijde and Annet de Boer. The friends already hold information sessions about bitcoin where they aim to explain the technology to people in a non-technical manner.  ""We know there is a lot of misunderstanding among the mass audience,"" said Eijkelhof.  This was one of the reasons that Eijkelhof and his friends decided to put together the Arnhem Bitcoincity event.  They were also inspired by the Bitcoin Boulevard in The Hague and wanted to host something similar.  The trio got the ball rolling by trying to recruit participating businesses. Eijkelhof admitted that it was difficult to get participants on board at first:  ""It was a challenge because there is a lot of scepticism about bitcoin. Once the first few [merchants] who were interested and open-minded about it said, 'Yes, let’s give it a try', and then we got some attention from the local media and other merchants noticed how it could lead to some positive attention and more people started joining in.""  He added, ""I think the most important thing that helped us convince merchants was just showing how easy it is [to accept bitcoin].""  Although the organisers in Arnhem have drawn inspiration from the Hague's Bitcoin Boulevard, Eijkelhof added that they have also learnt from the project's shortcomings:  ""Maybe one of the things that didn’t go so well in the Hague was that they actually required the merchants to work with bitcoin itself. The merchants had to check the QR code and check the transaction on the block chain – that’s too complicated for most people.""  The organisers in The Hague eventually sought out the help of Bit My Money's point-of-sale system to make the payment process simpler for the participants. However, it took them two months to bring a payment processer on board.  This is something that Eijkelhof and his co-organisers felt needed to happen right from the beginning. As a result, Eijkelhof built BitKasssa (Dutch for 'bitcoin checkout'), a payment system designed to make it easier for merchants to deal with bitcoin, he said, explaining:  ""[Merchants] don’t have to actually mess with anything bitcoin-related themselves. The customer pays in bitcoin, they receive their amount in euros and it’s completely hassle free for them. Once they see how easy it is, they say, 'Sure I have nothing to lose.'""  Although tomorrow's event is a one-off, the organisers are hoping the participating merchants continue to accept the digital currency. ""Several merchants already expressed their interest and intention to keep using bitcoin,"" says Eijkelhof.  ""For others, it's a bit of an experiment and they'll want to find out how it works out for them, but I expect at least some of them will keep accepting bitcoin – especially once they witness first-hand how fast and easy it is.""  Going Dutch with bitcoin  Though Arnhem’s Bitcoincity will be the second 'Bitcoin Boulevard' in the Netherlands, in other parts of the world, bitcoiners have tried to introduce similar projects, with varying degrees of success.  Last month, a group of Cleveland merchants came together to launch Bitcoin Boulevard US, however, the project saw a setback when the state of Ohio later revealed that bitcoin would be banned for use as payment in alcohol sales.  In comparison to other countries, the Netherlands has had very few regulatory hurdles. Eijkelhof says that the cultural attitude of the Dutch may be one reason why bitcoin has garnered a large following in the country.  ""It's a cultural thing. We've always been doing a lot of trading and we have always been open to other cultures. Also when it comes to drug policy, homosexuality etc, Holland is known for it’s openness [...] We are ahead of most other countries in terms of acceptance and I think that helps with bitcoin as well.""  Netherlands is also the country with the highest bitcoin nodes per capita.  Earlier this month, Amsterdam also hosted the Bitcoin2014 conference and the original Bitcoin Boulevard celebrated its two-month anniversary.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Roop Gill,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2014/05/27/arnhem-becomes-second-dutch-city-to-host-a-bitcoin-boulevard,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9718986d876f46a77181fb11c0df0f7013d43867-1000x585.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425712,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfUlh,1401213732,Inching Towards Bitcoin Derivatives,"Bitcoin derivatives are more in demand than ever, as bitcoin company executives seek a way to hedge balance sheet risk. A liquid futures and options exchange for bitcoin will provide commercial hedging opportunities as well as increase overall price stability. This is not disputed.  What will be contentious, however, are the paths and methods necessary to get there. In this article, I examine exchange structure, exchange jurisdiction, the practicality of various contracts, and existing bitcoin futures markets.  What are derivatives?  Derivatives obtain their name from the fact that they are instruments derived from an underlying spot commodity or index.  In theory, the spot price of the physical commodity underlies and provides the basis for pricing in the futures market due to the explicit option for physical delivery. In the case of an index, cash settlements are typically the norm.  'Call options' and 'put options' based on the futures contract can also be offered. Exchange-traded products differ from customized over-the-counter products in that they are standardized, easily traded and underwritten by the pooled collateral of exchange members.  In the recent working paper from the Mercatus Center, authors Jerry Brito, Houman Shadab, and Andrea Castillo evaluate the emergence of derivatives in the context of bitcoin.  As the most detailed analysis to date concerning bitcoin securities and derivatives regulation, the paper argues that ""financial regulators should consider exempting or excluding certain financial transactions denominated in bitcoin from the full scope of their regulations, much like private securities offerings and forward contracts are treated"".  The authors also anticipate what form the second wave of bitcoin regulation, mostly in the US, might take. I extend that thinking into the rationale for multi-jurisdictional exchanges and the free market emergence of bitcoin clearing houses to address counterparty risk.  Exchange structure  Any new bitcoin derivatives exchange will have to be electronic with 24/7 availability in order to mirror the existing spot markets for bitcoin trading. Just as with commodity exchanges that trade gold, silver, wheat and soybeans, warehousing partners will need to be established to accommodate the safe storage of bitcoin necessary for exchange integrity.  Ideally, the broker-dealer community will go through one of several wholesale clearing members to access the exchange for their clients, and these clearing members will underwrite the performance risk of their clients.  Posted collateral from the clearing members can take the form of cash, bonds or other liquid instruments determined by the exchange.  Furthermore, reasonable margin rules and position limits will have to be enforced to insulate the exchange and its clearing members during periods of extreme volatility.  Exchange jurisdiction  As evidenced by the likely manipulation in the precious metals markets and the MF Global debacle, government oversight of an exchange is no panacea for mischievous operators because the regulators themselves have been complicit for years.  Obviously, jurisdiction is important for the enforcement of contract performance, but exchanges would not require direct regulation for legitimacy.  Properly structured exchanges could easily facilitate and apply best practices for price discovery, trade clearing and trade settlement. Luxembourg and Gibraltar would be favourable early selections for such an exchange.  Also, multiple jurisdictions would be preferred for bitcoin derivatives exchanges in order to prevent a single jurisdiction, like the US, from exerting too much influence on an exchange that is vital to the bitcoin ecosystem.  Moreover, as bitcoin absorbs a greater and greater portion of overall economic activity, it could become tempting for certain jurisdictions to interfere in the price-discovery mechanism by participating in or encouraging naked short sales.  Former US Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers clearly understood the importance of managing investor expectations by suppressing gold prices as he was one of its principal architects.  In dissecting the methods of manipulation, Paul Craig Roberts, former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy, and investment expert Dave Kranzler conclude that the global volume concentration with just one exchange creates a single point of manipulation.  From their January 2014 paper, Roberts and Kranzler summarize the process:  ""When gold hit $1,900 per ounce in 2011, the Federal Reserve realized that $2,000 per ounce could have a psychological impact that would spread into the dollar’s exchange rate with other currencies, resulting in a run on the dollar as both foreign and domestic holders sold dollars to avoid the fall in value. Once this realization hit, the manipulation of the gold price moved beyond central bank leasing of gold to bullion dealers in order to create an artificial market supply to absorb demand that otherwise would have pushed gold prices higher. The manipulation consists of the Fed using bullion banks as its agents to sell naked gold shorts in the New York Comex futures market. Short selling drives down the gold price, triggers stop-loss orders and margin calls, and scares participants out of the gold trusts.""  As a Fed bullion bank through the acquisition of Bear Stearns, JP Morgan has held aggregated positions in gold and silver far in excess of CME Group position limits, frequently relying on hedger exemptions and waivers.  With digital commodity bitcoin, such brazen price suppression from the authorities may prove to be the ""last resort"" option and the only viable method for desperate governments seeking to maintain their unfair legal tender monopoly.  Printing paper money to underwrite massive naked short selling on bitcoin exchanges is the greatest single threat to bitcoin's long-term dominance as free market money. Multiple worldwide competitive exchanges would mitigate the impact of such a grim scenario.  Practicality of contracts  From the balance sheet perspective, bitcoin futures contracts would more logically adhere to the standards already in place for currency futures contracts. Therefore, typical contract specifications for bitcoin would include the following currency pairs: XBT/USD, XBT/EUR, XBT/GBP and XBT/CNY (all currently tracked by CoinDesk's BPI).  [post-quote]  Contract months would be quarterly in March, June, September and December, with the last trading day being the 15th of each settlement month.  Contract sizes would vary based on bitcoin valuation and growth, but it is logical to assume that 100-bitcoin and 250-bitcoin contracts would be the early norm. Initially, the minimum trading interval (or tick) would be 0.01 bitcoin.  Proposed margin requirements for the 100-bitcoin contract could be structured at 10.00 bitcoin for initial margin deposit and 8.00 bitcoin for maintenance margin deposit.  Accounts would be marked-to-market at the close of trading day for purposes of determining new margin capital or forced liquidation. For overall integrity, each exchange should also publish and adhere to aggregated position limits.  As pointed out by the Mercatus study, an alternative would be to denominate contract prices in bitcoin and hold margin funds in bitcoin, thereby eliminating the need for traditional bank or financial institution accounts. This would be possible if the contract was cash settled in bitcoin and the exchange maintained bitcoin warehousing requirements.  Existing bitcoin futures markets  Expect the terrain to shift dramatically in the coming months, but currently the largest and most significant bitcoin futures market is ICBIT.se operated by Alex Stukalov. The company is in the process of registering in an offshore jurisdiction and facilitated more than $15m-worth of bitcoin futures trading during the last 30 days.  Romanian-based MPEx operated by Mircea Popescu displays BTC/EUR futures with settlement each month and displays contracts in the standard calendar months for bitcoin ""network difficulty"" futures, however, it remains to be seen whether sufficient and tradeable liquidity exists. Indeed, MPEx/MPOE shuttered its BTC/USD options trading in February 2014 due to lack of a robust pricing feed.  We can learn a lot about bitcoin futures exchanges by studying these predecessors, especially in the areas of customer support, liquidity and counterparty risk. Neither ICBIT.se nor MPEx serve as a clearinghouse for their customers' trades, which is an essential element of a formal futures exchange. Furthermore, verifiable volume reporting will be critical as these futures exchanges will most likely play an important role for bitcoin price discovery.  The other operators claiming to be in the derivatives and hedging business are actually offering non-standardized margin trading by offering interest rates on borrowed funds. Notable entrants for margin trading include BitFinexhttps://www.bitfinex.com/pages/howitworks, BTC.sx, Bit4x and still-in-beta Coinsetter.  After the unwinding of the Bretton Woods currency arrangement in the 1970s, the gun-slinging traders of the Chicago pits transformed financial futures with various products designed to manage floating currency risk.  Now, nearly 45 years later, cryptocurrency futures markets seem poised to transform currency risk management again in the post-legal tender era.

Working with Fidor Bank enables the company to offer free Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) bank settlements to its merchant customer base.  According to BIPS, this option was originally available to its customers in Denmark, though the company is focusing on the entire European market.  BIPS  CEO Hans Heming said the association with Fidor is aimed at offering cheaper bitcoin payments processing to a broader merchant ecosystem:  ""This is a continuation of our global rollout enabling merchants anywhere to receive payments faster and cheaper, and more bank partnerships are to come.""  Notably, Fidor was the first bank to incorporate the Ripple payments protocol into its back-end systems, a decision announced earlier this month.  Greater bank involvement  Fidor enables BIPS to capture a greater marketshare in Europe. For Fidor, the move enables the bank to tap into the technological advantages offered by digital currencies, as evidenced by its integration of the Ripple protocol.  Heming also noted that BIPS is looking to forge new banking relationships in the future as it continues to push into new markets.  Payments protocol integration  BIPS has also joined a growing number of companies that have moved to incorporate the bitcoin payments protocol, a system for enhancing bitcoin transactions.  The payments processor deployed the protocol across all of its available service. The company's rivals, such as BitPay and Coinbase, are among those who have moved in recent months to integrate the protocol.  BIPS said that the move would make it easier for consumers to pay for goods and services using the digital currency, saying:  ""The end result is beneficial for both the business and the experience of buyers resulting in more revenue to the merchant in the long run, and a much better bitcoin ecosystem.""

The hashing power gains are significant: Alpha had originally promised 5 MH/s and 25 MH/s units, but earlier this year it revised those figures to 16 MH/s and 90 MH/s respectively. Now it is promising to deliver 50 MH/s and 250 MH/s – 10 times the original rates.  The company says the decision was made after long consideration and lengthy negotiations with its partners, coupled with strong competition in the scrypt mining market. Notably, KnCMiner generated a fair amount of buzz in the scrypt community with its 250 MH/s Titan miner, priced at $9,995.  With the latest revision, Alpha’s flagship Viper miner should offer similar performance at a somewhat lower price point. It's still too early to assess real-world performance, power efficiency and return on investment, but it is likely that the two machines will be close in spec.  While the company has decided to “add more power” to 'batch 1’ devices, it is unclear whether the speed gains are the result of simply adding more chips or tweaking the design. The company says it will “scale power accordingly”, so power consumption should not increase in line with performance.  Back to basics  Alpha points out that the increased hashing power does not come without compromise. After customer feedback indicated that power and efficiency are users' primary concerns, the company decided to drop certain features to stay competitive, telling its customers:  “This is a 'you can't have everything' situation: hash rate + fancy features. As a result of this decision, we are able to upgrade your devices but as we're going more 'back to basics' with the miners and the following features will have to be removed from the units to save both costs, space and speed up the manufacturing process.”  The redesigned, more frugal Vipers will ship without LCD displays, Wi-Fi connectivity or the WebGUI interface. Instead they will run via a wired USB or Ethernet connection.  Just a few weeks ago the company said the WebGUI interface was ready to go, while at the same time the company said it had initiated the tape-out process at GlobalFoundries, indicating the design had been finalized.  Thanks to the back-to-basics approach and lower margins, Alpha says that despite the extra power, it will not change the price, with the Viper staying at $2,200 and $9,000 for the 50 MH/s and 250 MH/s models respectively.  Cloud mining delayed  Alpha says it will not offer free cloud hashing for the time being, as the new hash rates make the cloud redundant for now, explaining:  “The cloud mining operation will always have taken place after batch 1 and it is a tough undertaking with many factors needing to be hashed out. Such as building the environment (network, security, hardware, etc.), programming the interfaces, setting a real-time purchase system etc.”  The company continued: “It's not something that can be done within a day yet we do see a growing demand to give exact details out immediately. That is simply impossible to achieve at this stage, it is not something that should be underestimated and we always, without exception, only want to deliver stable and properly built products: we do not want to rush anything.”  However, a cloud operation is definitely planned for the future, it says. Batch 1 clients will be offered a promotion, along with other existing clients, when the time comes.  The company insists it is still on track to ship the first miners in July at the stated price, and intends to resend invoices with the updated specs to all customers very soon.",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/27/alpha-technology-announces-new-back-to-basics-viper-miner-specs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fb9a640c2246d2290c357890c100e9a81c16d895-1024x751.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425696,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfULh,1401204943,Mt. Gox Revival Plan Hit With Objection from Creditor CoinLab,"CoinLab, the former operations manager for Mt. Gox in the US and Canada, has filed an objection to the plan to revive the now-defunct exchange issued by Sunlot Holdings, an investor group that includes John Betts, Matthew Roszak and Bitcoin Foundation board member-elect Brock Pierce.  A Seattle-based digital currency company, CoinLab entered into an agreement to handle the purchase, sale and exchange of bitcoin for Mt. Gox customers in the US and Canada back in November 2012. It later filed a lawsuit against Mt. Gox, claiming it was not provided with the adequate resources to fulfil the agreement. Mt. Gox later countersued in September both lawsuits are still unsettled.  The formal filing asserts, among a laundry list of claims, that the proposal by Sunlot ""does not account for the claims of other unsecured creditors"" (including CoinLab) and thus needs additional consideration before moving toward any final approval.  The complaint reads:  ""In an attempt to obtain approval of the Sunlot Proposal, Sunlot has crafted a procedural maneuver that attempts to cram down the proposal upon creditors, while avoiding competitive bidding or other meaningful creditor safeguards.""  The submission is expected to be addressed in a status conference in a Dallas, Texas, court today.  New uncertainty  The proposal, championed by the global legal team representing the exchange's former users, was given preliminary approval by a US court on 8th May.  At the time, representatives of the class action told CoinDesk they were optimistic that the plan would soon move to Japanese courts for review. Under the proposal, Sunlot would purchase Mt. Gox for 1 BTC, assuming the company's liabilities and providing former users with a 16.5% stake in the revived exchange.  CoinLab detailed how it is seeking to ensure its complaints are addressed before any proposal regarding Mt. Gox is finalized:  ""Until it receives full assurances that its rights and defenses will be protected, CoinLab is compelled to seek to protect its interests now, before the flawed Sunlot Proposal (and procedural evasion) can gain an unfair advantage.""  Competing bid  Perhaps most notably, CoinLab took aim at Sunlot's exclusive bid for the exchange, claiming that since its agreement to service Mt. Gox clients in North America is still active, and that as it has direct experience working with Mt. Gox, it is uniquely suited to continue the exchange's operations on behalf of creditors.  While CoinLab stopped short of issuing a bid, it did raise awareness to the fact that, should it chose to do so, no formal process for this filing is in place.  ""CoinLab offers a market efficiency to creditors because it can address disposition of its intellectual property rights in the exchange as well as market expertise. However, no process currently exists for competing overbids.""  These statements were called into question by lawyers representing the international class actions against the exchange, who said in a separate filing:  ""CoinLab is factually and legally wrong and seems only to trying to influence the orderly procedures of both the Class Action Litigation and the Japanese court system. CoinLab seems to be doing this because it views itself as a competitor to Sunlot and wants to bid.""  Missing funds  CoinLab also critiqued how the proposal, if approved, would effectively place Sunlot in the role currently being filed by Mt. Gox's Japanese bankruptcy attorney.  The company argued this would be problematic given that the company has certain vested interests, saying:  ""Despite the absence of adequate disclosure and competition for taking on a role more suited to an estate fiduciary, however, Sunlot has made no showing of its qualifications to manage and conduct such an investigation, let alone answered pressing questions about potential conflicts of interest it has suffered or may suffer.""  CoinLab also critiqued the cost that Sunlot plans to impose on former exchange users for certain services.  For example, of the investigation into missing funds rumored stolen from the exchange, CoinLab says that Sunlot will take 10% of net recoveries, a fee it critiqued as ""difficult to justify"" given that other parties, such as itself, have asked to assist in the process.  CoinLab continued, offering its services for the investigation again, saying it will perform such a service for less, and that further, it is qualified and has a legal right to do so:  ""Not only is that data the subject of longstanding CoinLab discovery requests in this Chapter 15 case and other actions, but CoinLab is entitled to that information under its License Agreement as part of its trade-secret protections and other rights.""  Mt. Gox was said to have lost upwards of 700,000 BTC at the time of its collapse, though as much as 200,000 BTC has been confirmed recovered.  Lawyers for the US class action have expressed the desire for additional discovery, speculating that the remaining coins could be currently under the control of Mt. Gox or its related entities.  Additional complaints  CoinLab also took issue with how the proposal would settle claims against former Mt. Gox employee Gonzague Gay-Bouchery and former owner and current equity stakeholder Jed McCaleb, stating that the individuals ""do not own or control the asset that they purport to settle"".  It also commented on the relationship between Mt. Gox and Sunlot, claiming:  ""Many questions surround the Sunlot Proposal as well, including concerning its principals, their relationship with MtGox, and their potential relationship with other insiders and colleagues of Mr. Karpeles.""  Kobayashi responds  In a separate filing, Mt. Gox bankruptcy trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi discussed CoinLab's filing, stating that such concerns are not the responsibility of the US courts, and by extension, the exchange's Chapter 15 bankruptcy filing that they are overseeing.  Kobayashi said:  ""Those issues and concerns should be directed to the Foreign Representative and the Tokyo Court in Japan, where the “main proceeding” is pending [...] the US acts as an adjunct or arm of a foreign bankruptcy court where the main proceedings are.""  Further, he concluded by stating that, as the Japanese courts are not currently looking at any revival proposals for the exchange, CoinLab's filing is ""premature"".

42425757,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfUhh,1401202339,SatoshiPoint to Launch Three New Bitcoin ATMs Across the UK,"SatoshiPoint has announced the launch of three new bitcoin ATMs across the UK this Friday: two in the capital and a third in Bristol, in the west of the country.      The startup will own and operate the ATMs, which are two-way Robocoin machines, allowing users to both buy and sell bitcoins for pounds sterling.      SatoshiPoint's second-generation ATMs will include a passport scanner, as well as biometric palm reader and driving licence reader, which will not be implemented initially, but seek to 'future proof' the machines for compliance with potential regulatory requirements.      The company says it plans to charge a flat 5% fee over the live bitcoin price on Bitstamp, but has future plans to integrate with Cointrader.net to speed up withdrawals.    The new ATMs will be sited at:  Old Street: Nincomsoup, located within Old Street Tube station.  Oxford Street: Rathbone News, Rathbone Place, London, W1T 1JS.  Bristol City Centre: SuperFoods, 25-27 St Stephens Street, Bristol, BS1 1JX.  Burgeoning bitcoin scene    London already has three bitcoin ATMs in operation: a Lamassu unit run by Future Coins at a trendy bar in Shoreditch (the capital's first), a Robocoin machine run by Global Bitcoin ATM at an Internet cafe in Holborn, and another Robocoin installed by QuickBitcoin at a coffee and e-cigarette bar near Liverpool Street tube station.      The launch of the two SatoshiPoint machines will make the city one of the easiest places in the world to quickly pick up some digital currency for cash – something essential if bitcoin is ever to go mainstream.      SatoshiPoint's Managing Director Jonathan James Harrison said:      “SatoshiPoint wants to take bitcoin mainstream in 2014 and believes that bitcoin ATMs are essential in making this a reality. Bitcoin ATMs provide a familiar and consistent way for normal people to get hold of bitcoin fast, or sell it quickly for real world physical cash.”            “This kind of real world infrastructure will suddenly make bitcoin seem more real to Joe Public and we believe it will be of fundamental importance to wider bitcoin acceptance and adoption,” he added.  About the company  UK-based Satoshipoint, which has been funded by its two directors Jonathan Harrison and Hassan Khoshtaghaza so far, has plans to roll out more machines across the country.  The company has been through Bank to the Future’s business crowdfunding programme and is currently looking to raise £150,000 to fund rapid expansion (see their YouTube pitch here).  Satoshipoint has already been approved by UK tax authority HMRC for the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS), which allows private investors to offset money invested in Satoshipoint against their personal income tax or capital gains tax.    To celebrate the launch of the new London ATMs, the company is holding a launch party at Nincomsoup from 6pm.      The event will be held in conjunction with XBTerminal.com – a fellow UK bitcoin startup that is promoting its bitcoin point-of-sale terminal. Details for the event can be found here.

42425697,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfUNh,1401198154,Bitstamp Passes Audit Overseen by Bitcoin Developer Mike Hearn,"Bitcoin exchange Bitstamp has passed an audit overseen by BitcoinJ developer Mike Hearn.  The former Google engineer confirmed in a report that a Bitstamp proof of reserves procedure was executed on 24th May.  ""I was asked to act as a neutral observer during this procedure to help build community conﬁdence in Bitstamp as a large holder of coins,"" he said in the report.  Hearn went on to stress that the procedure is not a ﬁnancial audit, but confirms that, at this time, ""Bitstamp holds suﬃcient bitcoins to cover their customer deposits, as tracked by their master database"".  The report continues:    ""As of 13:00 CEST 24/05/2014, Bitstamp held 183,497.40310794 BTC in their cold wallet. Combined with the money that was in their hot wallet this totalled to about 45 BTC more than the total customer deposits and Ripple IOUs recorded in their database.      A precise statement of how much more isn’t possible because the site was not suspended during the veriﬁcation procedure and so the size of the hot wallet ﬂuctuated throughout, as withdrawals and deposits were processed.""    According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, 183,497.40310794 BTC is currently worth around $102.9m.  How it worked  In order to prove how many bitcoins the company has stored in its cold wallet, Bitstamp broadcast a send-to-self transaction and then signed a message Hearn selected with the associated private key.  Hearn's report states:    ""To prove to me the size of the company's deposits, I was given direct MySQL access to their master database. We ran a SQL SELECT SUM(btc_balance) query on the user_proﬁles table to determine the total outstanding balances.      Earlier I had reviewed some of the site code to verify that indeed this table was being updated when deposits and withdrawals took place.""    He goes on to assure that the procedure didn't expose any customer-speciﬁc private information.  When asked why he decided to oversee the procedure, Hearn told CoinDesk: ""The Bitstamp guys want to do this semi-regularly with a different observer each time. I was asked to do this, and as I now am self-employed, it made sense to go and visit them.""  He went on to emphasise the importance of audits such as this, claiming that they ""help dispel rumours and build trust in the ecosystem.""  Hearn doesn't, however, believe it's the right time for a standard audit system to be created and used by all bitcoin exchanges.  ""It's a bit early to be setting standards yet,"" he explained.  ""There's still a lot of variance in techniques and technologies being used, with new R&D still being done. Once things settle down some more, a standard way to audit exchanges would be useful indeed.""  Quarterly audits  This isn't the first audit the company has undergone, and it won't be the last. The company's first audit took place late last year, with the result being announced in early March.  As part of that audit, which was led by Firestartr.co, Bitstamp moved 194,933 BTC to a single bitcoin wallet. This transaction didn't go unnoticed and sparked widespread speculation, with some people correctly guessing Bitstamp was behind it, but others suggesting bitcoin's founder Satoshi Nakamoto was responsible.  Bitstamp CEO Nejc Kodrič told CoinDesk his company plans to undergo an audit once per quarter, to prove its transparency and solvency to both its current and potential customers.  ""We want encourage other exchanges to do the same. It is a step towards better consumer protection,"" he explained.

42425699,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfUPh,1401188645,Investor Jim Rogers: I Missed the Boat on Investing in Bitcoin,"Investor Jim Rogers, of Rogers Holdings fame, has said he missed the boat on investing in bitcoin.  In a recent interview with China Money Network, the veteran investor said he still does not know much about digital currencies, but he admitted that he should have got on board a long time ago:  “If I were smart, I would have bought it in the early days when people first told me about it. I still don't know enough about it to invest in it.”  Future of money?  Rogers said there have always been great investments around the world, so he was not focused on digital currencies in the past. Furthermore, it all seemed too complicated at the time, he said.  He indicated that he might invest in digital currencies in the future, provided he learns enough about them.  When asked whether or not digital currencies like bitcoin have a future, Rogers said the world has serious currency needs and serious problems, but, he is not sure whether or not digital currencies are the answer:  “The US dollar has dominated the world for the past 70 to 80 years. [...] We need something to compete with the US dollar, and something to replace it eventually. Whether it's the bitcoins, the RMB or seashells, I have no idea.”  Artificial liquidity  Rogers discussed various economic and geopolitical issues in the interview. His biggest concern in terms of economics, he said, is that all major banks have been “printing huge amounts of money” over the past five or six years.  “It's the first time in recorded history that we have the Japanese, British, European and Americans all printing money at the same time. So we have this artificial ocean of liquidity, which is making markets do well, but it's not doing much for the economy worldwide. When it ends, we will all pay a terrible price,” he cautioned.  In spite of ominous developments on the monetary front, Rogers said the geopolitical situation should not be overblown, although he does expect to see bigger conflicts over the next decade.  “Politicians have always made foolish mistakes throughout history. They will make mistakes again, and we will all pay for it,” he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/27/investor-jim-rogers-i-missed-the-boat-on-investing-in-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a37ad638014c836238fdb42d2bf3027508ffaec6-1024x572.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425703,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfUTh,1401182887,Polish Tax Authority: Bitcoin Mining Profits Subject to 23% VAT,"In the latest turn of events related to the disputed legal status of digital currencies in Poland, a local tax authority has announced that the sale of mined bitcoins is subject to a VAT (value-added tax) of 23%.  The interpretation was made by the director of the tax authorities in Łódź, central Poland, following a request submitted by a Polish bitcoin miner.  In the released statement, the authorities said that the party requested an interpretation of the Polish regulation regarding taxes imposed on the sale of mined bitcoins.  'Not a commodity'  ""The applicant is planning to launch sales of the cryptocurrency as part of his commercial activity,"" the statement said.  According to the document, the miner's bitcoins were destined to be sold to three entities, one of which would be located outside the European Union, and a further two within its borders. These included a company headquartered in Belize, another firm which owns a website registered in the UK, and a third company that operates a website registered in Łódź.  In his correspondence with the Polish tax authorities, the applicant said that he believed none of these transactions would be subject to a Polish VAT, and asked the authorities to confirm this interpretation.  ""According to the applicant [...] the sale of bitcoin is not subject to a value-added tax for commodities and services because bitcoin is not a commodity [...] and the sale of the cryptocurrency which is mined by the taxpayer does not constitute a service,” the authorities said. ""The applicant said that a mined bitcoin is not a commodity [...] because it does not have a material form.”  No legal basis  However, the authorities said that such an interpretation does not have legal basis, because ""the applicant is demanding a precise fee for the service [of bitcoin mining].""  ""Under the current law, the applicant’s legal assessment of the said situation is incorrect,” the statement said. ""The sale of the mined cryptocurrency [...] by the applicant to customers with the use of Internet and websites will constitue an activity which is subject to VAT in the territory of Poland.""

Bitcoin enthusiasts from within the Netherlands and the world over have travelled to the Dutch city to spend their digital money on delicious meals or chilled beers.  So, it's no wonder that Kadhim Shubber and I ended up there when the CoinDesk team was in the country for Bitcoin2014 on 16th to 17th April.  The Bitcoin Boulevardhttp://www.bitcoinboulevard.nl/ is a project started by Hendrik Jan Hilbolling and Peter Klasen who convinced 10 merchants – many of them their friends – along one canal in The Hague to start accepting bitcoin.  On 20th March, the businesses on the two streets running along the canal in the city – Bierkade and Groenewegje – started accepting bitcoin. The original Bitcoin Boulevard comprised of nine restaurants and an art gallery.  Many of the participating merchants were new to bitcoin, but Hilbolling and Klasen explained the many benefits of accepting bitcoin.  Along with the fact that they would be attracting new customers and gaining publicity, Klasen said he told them that it would be an important statement for the city, explaining:  ""If they would accept bitcoin, it would be a statement for the city or the nation. That statement would be that we are open for new technology.”  New changes  During the two months that the programme has been up and running, it has garnered media attention from all over the world.  However, merchants have also expressed some annoyance with the procedures surrounding the acceptance of bitcoin into their personal wallets.  Then life got a little simpler for some of the merchants, when Bit My Money's Robert-Reinder Nederhoed started introducing his company's new point-of-sale system on the boulevard.  Nederhoed explained why Klasen and Hilbolling sought out his help:  “With the price drop [...] the merchants asked the organisation to come up with a better solution.""  Bit My Money's interface made it not only easier for shops and restaurants to accept bitcoin, but it also reduced the risk of dealing with the volatility of the digital currency.  ""They get a proof of payment immediately and we take the risk,"" said Nederheoed. ""They get a signal that it has been paid. They get the exact amount at the end of the week […] there is no risk of fluctuation.""  He has visited more than half of the businesses already and installed the Bit My Money POS system in two stores so far.  Other cities follow suit  Klasen and Hilbolling told us that bitcoiners from other cities in the Netherlands, including Amsterdam, have reached out to them because they want to set up their own Bitcoin Boulevards.  Arnhem, a city closer to the German border, is hosting Arnhem Bitcoincity on 28th May, during which many of the city's restaurants and cafes will be accepting bitcoin for the day.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | TRADING,Roop Gill,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2014/05/27/video-hollands-bitcoin-boulevard-celebrates-two-successful-months,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d0e6399c7c031a08e2ec83fdd4c4b017e3d0f02-1000x588.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
