42431637,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4YVh,1584486702,Steem Community Plans Hostile Hard Fork to Flee Justin Sun's Steemit,"The blockchain for bloggers, Steem, is moving to Hive.io, CoinDesk has learned. The hostile hard fork is scheduled for Friday.      ""My own opinion,Justin Sun thought this was a voting war,"" Blocktrades founder Dan Notestein told CoinDesk. Blocktrades is a leading validator on the Steem blockchain and Notestein is among the developers coordinating the hard fork's software.      Sun's Tron Foundation acquired Steemit, Steem’s leading social media dapp, on Feb. 14. The acquisition kicked off a protracted fight between Sun and the Steem community over which side leads the chain. At issue is a pile of Steemit Inc.-controlled steem tokens known as the “ninja-mined stake” that Sun could have used to determine the blockchain’s fate.      For this initial hard fork, one key thing will change: The tokens from the original development fund controlled by Steemit will not be carried over to the new chain. Everyone else's will be ported over.      “He didn't understand that the underlying value of those tokens is the community,” Notestein said. “In the end, if not enough people support those tokens, they become worthless.""      In short, rather than continue the fight for Steem, prominent community leaders hope to take their community with them to greener pastures.      Read more: Justin Sun Bought Steemit. Steem Moved to Limit His Power      Decentralize this    Steem is best known as a crypto alternative to Medium. Bloggers write posts and share a small portion of the block rewards based on the popularity of their posts.      Notestein runs a top witness (like a bitcoin miner) on Steem. He also runs a service somewhat like ShapeShift that makes it easy to switch between coins.      Last night he wrote a post on Steem that reflected conversations currently going on within a Slack group detailing the rough plan to hard fork the blockchain so the Tron Foundation gets shut out of it entirely. The new blockchain is tentatively known as ""Hive.""      The nature of Steem makes this fairly easy.      Read more: Why Crypto Should Care About Justin Sun’s Steem Drama      Basically, the fork's developers will make a copy of the blockchain, which has the unique characteristic of carrying in it copies of all the blog posts that people have written to date.      This means that with a hard fork all the blogging data is preserved. Other dapps supporting the blogging function can just redirect to the copy of that data on the new blockchain. Notestein said many of the dapps besides Steemit will do so, but CoinDesk has not been able to confirm that as of press time.      Steemian, a Steemit alternative, said it would fully make the switch, though it would wait as long as a couple of weeks to help users transition over. The game Splinterlands, which is the most popular Steem dapp, according to Dapp.com, confirmed it would make the switch once the chain was stable and the team had adjusted all the technology on its end. The owner of SteemD, a block explorer, told CoinDesk it would do some kind of format that lets users choose between the two. For many dapps, the switch will require rebranding.      The fork captures the decentralized nature of blockchains. Both chains will have all the content submitted before the hard fork. Which blockchain future content gets posted to will depend on which user interface a user uses. Presumably, if a user is used to blogging on Steemit, their post-hard-fork posts will still get saved on the chain with Justin Sun's tokens.      The Tron Foundation did not respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk.      What will change    In terms of steem token supplies, the developers will take a snapshot of all the wallets at some block then allocate the same token volume to all the wallets on the new chain.      Everyone with tokens on Steem will also have tokens on the new chain; that is, except for the Steemit wallets controlled by Sun’s Tron Foundation.      ""Our immediate plan is to keep it simple. We are doing this very quickly,"" Notestein said.      Read more: Steem Community Mobilizes Popular Vote in Battle With Justin Sun      However, there will be one tweak so that exchanges will be much less likely to vote their tokens on behalf of someone trying to run a governance coup, as Binance and Huobi did on Tron's behalf recently (each has since expressed regret for doing so).      ""One of the initial changes will be an improvement in the DPoS [distributed proof-of-stake] system to prevent attacks of this sort,"" Notestein said. Basically, if a user on the new blockchain stakes their tokens, they won't be able to engage in governance votes for 30 days.      Steem is unique in the degree to which governance requires users to really lock-in their assets. Once someone decides to vote their tokens, they are locked up for a long time (""powering up""). It takes 13 weeks for all the tokens to ""power down"" in Steem parlance (they release gradually over that time).      Currently valued at $46 million on CoinMarketCap, Notestein expects steem tokens to plummet in value after the hard fork.      He said users are holding now because they want to get the new blockchain's tokens, then he expects steem will be widely dumped. Notestein himself is a steem whale, and he said he plans to dump accordingly.      In terms of establishing value for the new token, Notestein believes one exchange will list it. He also plans to launch an exchange on which the Steem community can use the new token. They already have the technology ready, he said.          Ready to go    Notestein thinks much of the content-contributing community will switch over. Notestein's post about the fork yielded more than 1,700 votes and over 700 comments.      ""The way Justin Sun has come in, he's just rubbed everybody wrong,"" Notestein said. ""The thing about Steem is it basically introduces people to a lot of the ideas of crypto even if they just come here to blog.""      Case in point: As talks broke down, Sun took to Steemit himself to urge witnesses to come over to his side. But he let his frustration show. In a March 5 post since largely deleted (but whose original lives on inside the blockchain) Sun asked: ""Do you like Justin Sun or you just want to fuck him?"" It went on from there in a similar spirit.      ""Steem is a much more social blockchain. It's kind of a different feel,"" Notestein said. ""That really was our number one goal: to maintain that community from really an existential threat from Tron.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | BNB | FORKS,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/03/17/steem-community-plans-hostile-hard-fork-to-flee-justin-suns-steemit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1733207d5de41993f1996afb6979b8f158574b80-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It’s clear many markets are performing similarly - at least for the time being.      “This is not the first time that bitcoin traded in tandem with other assets,” said Denis Vinokourov, head of research for London-based digital asset firm Bequant. “Other examples include the China trade war and geographic tensions in Iran, but every time the correlation was promptly unwound.”      One metric used to evaluate cryptocurrency, bitcoin’s market value to realized value (MVRV) Z-score fell below zero on Friday, suggesting BTC is undervalued. Some traders see recent price swings as natural capitulation from some market participants, with determination to buy from others.      “The weak hands are leaving and the firm believers are buying,” said Sweden-based over-the-counter crypto trader Henrik Kugelburg.      Indeed, other traders have the view that institutions are selling while retail types are scooping up bitcoin at what they see as discount pricing.      The S&P 500 is up 4 percent in trading as of 18:00 UTC after the Trump administration announced measures to stave off an economic downfall because of the coronavirus pandemic after the Federal Reserve's interest rate bazooka did not have the desired immediate effect on the stock market.      Gold is up by less than a percentage point on the day, and the yellow metal is another indicator of how the markets feel about rate cuts and other measures world governments are taking to deal with the coronavirus crisis.      “It's very scary when the Fed cuts rates to zero over the weekend and you see the reaction that the market has had,” said Rupert Douglas, Head of Institutional Sales for digital asset manager Koine.“Normally, gold would be screaming higher.”      Despite the fears, traders will need to keep focusing on what they do best - remaining calm and using the tools at their disposal to deal with price swings.      “You can go long with very limited risk and a large reward if you trade with tight stops,” added Douglas.      Outside of bitcoin, cryptocurrency prices making notable moves today include Lisk (LSK) up 11 percent, IOTA (IOTA) up 6 percent and bitcoin SV (BSV) in the green 6 percent.",POSITIVE,BTC | IOTA,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | IOTA,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/17/after-a-wild-ride-stocks-take-a-breather-and-crypto-bounces-back,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d49cb6a98208676be54bb01dbbd463141dfaa67e-1197x873.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431646,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4Yjh,1584470885,BlockFi Raises Deposit Rates as Bitcoin Crash Juices Loan Demand,"An increase in borrower demand is driving crypto lender BlockFi to raise interest rates for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) deposits on April 1, said CEO Zac Prince.      The second-largest price drop in bitcoin’s history last Thursday created a gulf between prices on the bitcoin futures and spot markets. In the following days, BlockFi saw a 10x increase on the trading side of the house, and a surge in loan demand from its two largest client pools: market makers and proprietary trading firms.      Institutional borrowing across all assets made up for a decrease in retail U.S. dollar borrowing, and BlockFi saw a record number of transactions as traders took advantage of arbitrage opportunities.      In the past, the crypto lender has had to cut rates because borrower supply had not met depositor demand. Since Thursday, BlockFi has seen a slowdown in net deposit growth to roughly 0 percent but not an outright decrease.      Next month, Tier 1 BTC holders (those who keep up to five BTC on BlockFi) will earn 6 percent annual percentage yield (APY) and Tier 1 ETH holders (up to 500 ETH) will earn 4.5 percent APY. Currently, Tier 1 BTC holders and Tier 1 ETH holders earn 4.9 percent and 3.6 percent APY, respectively.      Rates for the GUSD and USDC stablecoins will stay the same at 8.6 percent APY.      The higher rates on deposits stem from the firm’s ability to increase interest rates on crypto lending, Prince said. A week ago, BlockFi had interest rates on loans in the mid-single digits. The firm is now charging rates in the ballpark of 10 percent, Prince added. By contrast, crypto lender Celsius has raised interest rates on ETH loans to an astounding 260 percent from the 15 to 20 percent under normal circumstances.      While not revealing the number or volume of margin calls BlockFi made during the crash, Prince said that the firm had to request less additional collateral than rival firms Genesis and Celsius. Last Friday, CoinDesk reported Genesis alone had called in $100 million in additional crypto from about 40 clients.      Read more: $100M+ in Margin Calls: Crypto Lenders Demand Collateral as Market Buckles      “It could be due to the construction of the [loan] book,” Prince said. “For example, we have no loans with bitcoin miners at BlockFi. … Hut 8 was a public mining operation company that was talking about their margin call with Genesis.”      Prince also said no changes would be made to BlockFi’s underwriting standards.      BlockFi did see less than 10 percent of liquidations in its dollar-denominated loan book. These liquidations happened prior to bitcoin’s dip below $4,500, Prince said, and were a result of the firm’s risk management system which manages margin calls, liquidations and monitoring of liquidity on the market. The BlockFi team, which is currently working remotely, monitors and controls the system on a day-to-day basis.      “It is a tough time from the sentiment perspective,” Prince said. “Take crypto out of the picture, the fear level and things people are going to go through over the next few days, weeks and months is very challenging.”",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/17/blockfi-raises-deposit-rates-as-bitcoin-crash-juices-loan-demand,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/62456251a2ded787eb07573beb40201cf6a69876-2476x1670.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431642,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4Ydh,1584469857,Experts Say the Fed's QE Program Will Strengthen Bitcoin – One Way or Another,"Another enormous program of quantitative easing (QE) ought to benefit bitcoin, both in terms of its reputation as a hedge against centralized changes to the financial system, but also directly, as asset prices gradually rise across the board.      While QE may be anathema to crypto hardliners, some experts agree the net effect on prices is positive, one way or another.      QE has helped drive up the price of bitcoin (BTC) over the past decade, according to economist and author Frances Coppola. “What QE does is raise asset prices across the board and that would include new alternative assets like bitcoin,” she said.      The idea bitcoin is somehow uncorrelated with the financial mainstream is now being convincingly laid to rest, Coppola added (last week’s coronavirus shock saw bitcoin shedding close to 50 percent of its value).      Central banks conducted three rounds of QE between 2009 and 2015, during which time the S&P 500 rallied by more than 200 percent. Gold, a classic safe-haven asset, rose from $800 to $1,921 in the three years leading up to 2011 only to fall back to $1,050 by December 2015. Since the last financial crash in 2008, QE helped global private wealth grow by two-thirds to $166 trillion, according to the Boston Consulting Group.      However, the notion that expending the quantity of money in developed economies leads to hyperinflation – a popular idea among some bitcoin advocates – is false, Coppola said.      “There is absolutely no evidence that QE causes hyperinflation. The way QE works is to push investors into higher-yielding assets – and bitcoin, while being unbelievably volatile, is higher yielding. So what you actually get are asset bubbles, including bitcoin,” she said.      In the current state of crisis, the bazooka of measures by the Federal Reserve failed to stabilize markets caught in a desperate flight towards cash. To counteract the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the Federal Reserve announced a $700 billion bond buying program and that it would be cutting the interest depository institutions charge one another overnight for reserves to between 0.0 and 0.25 percent.      Simon Peters, a market analyst at eToro, agreed that once the rise in COVID-19 cases outside China tails off, investors will be looking toward assets like bitcoin.      “Investor sentiment could shift to, ‘Now I have all of this cash and with the increase in monetary supply, what do I do and where do I put it?’” said Peters, adding:    “Holding cash is not beneficial in these circumstances because the currency has been devalued and you are losing purchasing power so where do you put it? That is potentially where the likes of bitcoin and other crypto-assets may see the benefit.”    A so-called Cantillon Effect refers to the change in relative prices resulting from a shift in the money supply. Assets like stocks and real estate become overpriced, meaning assets like bitcoin become more attractive over time, as noted by analyst Pierre Rochard and VanEck director Gabor Gurbacs.      Based on what’s happening in the mainstream financial system, bitcoin still counts as “Doomsday insurance,” according to Alex Mashinsky, CEO of crypto lending platform Celsius Network.      “They are printing money that did not exist yesterday and they are giving it to everybody,” Mashinsky said of central banks. “But you can’t say, ‘We have this disease so we are going to print another 5 million bitcoin,’ or, ‘We want to be re-elected so we are going to print another 10 million bitcoin,’” he said.      For some time now, Caitlin Long, the force behind Wyoming’s blockchain legislation and now CEO of Avanti Financial Group, has been critical of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Long called for increased capital requirements on banks to deleverage the situation, back when there were rumblings in the repo market that liquidity was starting to become scarce.      “History is not going to support the decision of the FOMC to ease the banks' capital requirements,” she said.      Central banks are running the same playbook as always and it's not working, Long said, adding:    “The quantity of stimulus that they are throwing at this is staggering in size if you compare it to the size of QE1, QE2 – they are now doing QE1s in a single day, when QE1 was done over a span of months.”    The QE1 program lasted from December 2008 until March 2010 and saw the Fed buying $600 billion in mortgage-backed securities and $100 billion in other debt.      For the first time in several years, Long said she went out and bought some bitcoin right after markets crashed last week (she cautioned this is not to be read as financial advice).      “All I know is bitcoin is an asset that is no one's IOU. I would prefer to diversify my wealth away from assets that are someone's IOU, when I don't know if that someone is solvent,” Long said.    Halving ahead    As traditional finance zigs down the QE route, bitcoin is zagging in the opposite direction.      In two months, the supply of new bitcoin will be reduced by 50 percent – an occurrence scheduled for roughly every four years known as the “halving.”      “As the U.S. government prints another trillion-plus dollars, this will have long-term ramifications on inflation and dilution of money. On the other hand, we will still have 21 million [bitcoins] available, ever,” said Alex Blum, COO of Hong Kong-based fintech firm Two Prime. “The halvening will happen when it’s set to happen.”      Bitcoin’s scarcity to value argument involves “an ideological statement of faith,” in Coppola’s opinion.      “There will always be people who believe that scarcity alone is sufficient to make something valuable. In actual fact, something that is so scarce that nobody wants to buy it isn't valuable at all. Things need to have liquidity,” she said.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/17/experts-say-the-feds-qe-program-will-strengthen-bitcoin-one-way-or-another,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af1aceda9eac370f9dc2c91a2dd3f9235cd3ffe5-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431651,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4Yth,1584464749,Record Bitcoin Price Volatility Fails to Unnerve HODLers,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price volatility has surged to record highs but the long-term investors popularly known as “HODLers” don't seem to be deterred.      The cryptocurrency’s three-month implied volatility rose to a lifetime high of 6.8 percent on a daily basis (equal to 130 percent annualized) on March 13, according to crypto derivatives research firm Skew.      The implied daily volatility stood at 3.5 percent (66.9 percent annualized) a week ago. Going further back, the gauge had dropped to a 12-month low of 3.2 percent (61.2 percent annualized) on Feb. 23, when bitcoin was trading near $10,000.       Bitcoin’s ATM volatility on one-month options, which measures the calculated or implied mid-rate volatility for an at-the-money (ATM) option, also hit a record high of 184 percent on an annualized basis on Monday.       See also: Retail Investors Are Buying, the Bitcoin Institutions Are Selling, Traders Say      The unprecedented implied volatility – the option market's opinion of bitcoin’s potential moves – could be associated with the recent sell-off. Bitcoin topped out at $10,500 in mid-February and fell to 12-month lows below $4,000 last week. That's a solid 63 percent drop in just four weeks.       The cryptocurrency shed nearly 39 percent of its value in just a single day on March 12.       Many observers say extreme bouts of price volatility will hinder bitcoin’s global mass adoption. Even so, the long-term investors appear to be unperturbed.      While bitcoin’s price is down 40 percent on a month-to-date basis, the number of HODLers, or addresses holding coins for over a year, remains near the record high of 18.68 million reached in February.       As of March 16, there were 18.21 million addresses holding bitcoins for more than 12 months, according to data provided by the blockchain intelligence firm IntoTheBlock.       The data indicate bitcoin’s investor community may believe bitcoin could become an integral part of the financial system in the future. “They see any drop in price as a mere speed bump on the road leading to where BTC’s value both in utility and price is substantially larger than what has been seen to date,” Justin Gillespie, CEO of Titus Investment Advisors and a bitcoin trader, told CoinDesk.       George McDonaugh, managing director and co-founder of London-based digital asset investment company KR1 plc, says long-term holders are believers in the technology and are immune to price volatility. He added that they could continue to pick up cheap bitcoins in the interim because the cryptocurrency is still viewed among many as a hedge against the current global macro environment.       The coronavirus outbreak has forced the U.S., Italy and a few other nations to put entire cities into lockdown. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has responded by cutting the benchmark fed funds rates to near 0.0 percent and launching a quantitative easing program worth $700 billion per month. Other major central banks have also delivered rate cuts over the past week or so.       See also: Bitcoin Is Now Undervalued, Suggests This Price Metric      “When banks are shut, bitcoin is open; when ATMs are closed, bitcoin is cash; when governments print unfathomable sums of cash, bitcoin cannot be debased,” McDonaugh told CoinDesk.       Mike Alfred, CEO of Digital Assets Data, echoed similar sentiments while stressing the HOLDers are, for the most part, not macro traders but are ordinary retail investors with a very long-term perspective.       “The macro backdrop has never been more bullish for bitcoin with a magical combination of synchronized global liquidity and declining trust in central banks and centralized authority,” Alfred told CoinDesk.      So far, however, bitcoin has not worked as a haven asset during the recent market turmoil and instead has moved in tandem with the equity markets. The cryptocurrency’s 40 percent drop in value has coincided with a 17 percent fall in the S&P 500 index since the start of the month.     HODling ahead of halving?    Bitcoin is set to undergo mining reward halving sometime in May 2020. As the name suggests, the rewards per block mined will be halved from current 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC. The process is repeated every four years and is aimed at curbing inflation in the cryptocurrency.       Many long-time market participants say bitcoin will pick up a strong bid after halving. “While the cryptocurrency may not have found a floor yet, the supply reduction due to the halving event will eventually drive the price up,” Olga Kochmar, CEO of mining farm operator Zionodes told CoinDesk.      The bullish narrative related to halving could also be the reason behind investors holding onto their coins despite the recent price crash.     Adoption demand at all-time highs? One caveat    Record number of addresses holding bitcoin for more than a year does not imply actual demand for adoption, as a single person can hold multiple addresses.       “Bitcoin addresses are pseudonymous, which allows a single user or wallet to create a near-infinite amount of addresses that all belong to the same user. As a simplistic comparison, think of Bitcoin addresses as cash. A person can have multiple $20 bills in their wallet, but they all belong to the same wallet and user,” said Wayne Chen, CEO of Interlapse Technologies and founder of Coincurve.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/17/record-bitcoin-price-volatility-fails-to-unnerve-hodlers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6a629e506974e778cd5b083e933b04d2377c0794-2560x1709.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431652,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4Yvh,1584461436,MakerDAO Adds USDC as DeFi Collateral Following 'Black Thursday' Chaos,"MakerDAO has added a third asset to its decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, USD Coin (USDC), in response to the system’s flagship stablecoin, dai, continuing to float above its dollar peg.      Passed Tuesday at 2:58 UTC, the Coinbase- and Circle-backed USDC is now available for use as collateral on the premiere DeFi platform following an executive governance vote, according to a blog post.    Only $20 million USDC can be used on the system but with up to 20 percent interest rate earnings, according to the newly established USDC risk parametershttps://vote.makerdao.com/executive-proposal/proposal-for-collateral-onboarding-of-usdc. Users will be able to deposit USDC as collateral (in addition to the system’s two other underlying assets, ether (ETH) and Basic Attention Token (BAT)) and receive dai in return.    Almost $1 million in USDC-backed dai has been minted since the vote’s passage, according to data site Dai Stats.      At the heart of the USDC addition is a pressing issue: dai’s dwindling supply. Without a larger supply of dai on the market, the stablecoin went for a premium last week which threatened to capsize the largest DeFi platform.      When ETH lost 30 percent of its value in 24 hours on March 12, the whole network flipped into chaos, including dai’s price. Another ETH price crash could prove fatal, community members warned. Some 1.8 million ETH (or roughly $211 million as of press time) is currently locked in.      “I don’t think we ever have this [governance] conversation unless it was an absolute emergency,” said Chris Padovano, former legal advisor to the MakerDAO Foundation in a governance call Monday.      “We don’t know what’s going to happen in the next few days. If there was ever a time to be brave and do this, now is the time,” he said of adding USDC.    Philosophical implications      Dai’s peg has continued to sit uncomfortably high above the U.S. dollar after “Black Thursday.” Users flocked to dai for stability in the wake of ETH’s crash, increasing the token's price and lowering supply on the market.      The Maker Foundation has made several efforts to find liquidity for dai since March 12. A governance vote by MKR token holders tinkered with various network metrics to increase the supply of dai and therefore alleviate illiquidity. Monday’s vote also lowered dai’s interest rate (also known as the “Stability Fee”) from 4 percent to 0 percent.      It didn’t work, so the team called in the cavalry: centralized stablecoin USDC.      The pros and cons of adding the collateral asset were weighed Monday on both a governance call and on the Maker Foundation forum. A chief concern was USDC’s issuer and final authority: Coinbase and Circle. Those in favor of alternatives, such as linking Maker with other DeFi liquidity pools, noted Circle’s right to censor addresses at its discretion.      The addition was unprecedented given the DeFi network’s intent to create a “completely decentralized” stablecoin, dai, backed by other cryptocurrencies, according to the white paper.      As events have panned out, dai’s hold above $1.00 – and the potential consequences from it – have remained a larger concern for the Foundation and MKR holders who executed the vote.    Do or dai      Dai is a barometer for Maker. If the stablecoin sits above the dollar peg, it means the underlying token economics are not working as intended.      In this situation, particularly after ETH’s price drop, Maker community members held two concerns: the system is vulnerable to a second flash drop in ETH’s value and dai is extremely illiquid on the general market right now, according to Maker Foundation community manager LongForWisdom in Monday’s call.      First, ETH’s last flash drop created a $5.7 million debt within the Maker system. This debt was created by a flaw in the auction of the collateralized debt that users put in smart contracts to create dai. These smart contracts are called collateralized debt positions (CDP).      In short, the price of ETH dropped below the collateral levels for some CDPs, triggering instant liquidations. Liquidations are sold on an open market between automated market makers called “keepers.” This open market, as it turned out, was not so open.      Due to a bug in the system, certain keepers were able to purchase auctioned collateral (typically ETH) for practically no cost during the chaos of Thursday and early Friday’s trading action. The network announced the printing and sale of MKR tokens to cover the debt. This token auction is provisioned in the white paper.      What is not provided for – and as unhappy investors CoinDesk spoke with expressed – was the total loss of ETH from CDPs. A 13 percent “slashing fee” to cover the liquidation of ETH is what most investors expected.      Pete Johnson, a Maker CDP holder who claims to have lost some 2,700 ETH (currently valued at roughly $315,000), is now forming a legal effort against the Maker Foundation with some of the other 4,000 CDP vaults that lost large portions of ETH to the protocol. (Note: One vault does not equal one owner.)      Will it succeed? To a large degree, it doesn’t matter. What does matter is that the largest DeFi protocol choked during a stress test.      Another drop in ETH’s price could not only create another debt burden on the system, but could create an untenable leakage of DeFi enthusiasts.      “Due to the on-going liquidity situation and dai price instability, we need to make a quick decision on risk parameters such that the executive can go on-chain as quickly as possible,” MakerDAO community member Cyrus said in the proposal forum Monday.      Indeed, the Maker team rushed to find a patch.    Not only was a 24-hour governance timeout rule to safeguard the system from internal enemies dropped to fourhttps://vote.makerdao.com/executive-proposal/adjust-risk-parameters-governance-security-module-and-liquidation-freeze-module on Saturday, but Maker added USDC when the same conversation six months earlier, concerning tether (USDT), called for a “comprehensive evaluation process” that would “lay out all the risks and problems associated with the collateral.”    If Maker goes, where goes DeFi?      Probably not a question most Ethereum fans want to ask right now, though some are preparing. A list of over 100 DeFi enthusiasts have vowed to act as the “buyer of last resort” for the upcoming MKR token sale.    USDC and dai’s search for liquidity    Still, the underlying issue in Maker remains dai, Messari researcher Jack Purdy told CoinDesk. For now, the Maker community is pinning its hopes on the more centralized USDC.      To be fair, there is precedent. You can buy dai on plenty of exchanges with USDC.      And again, backing a decentralized stablecoin with a centralized stablecoin is not a new idea for Maker. The concept was floated around last September with USDT.      At the time, MakerDAO founder and CEO Rune Christensen said adding a stablecoin like USDT to the Maker ecosystem added liquidity for market makers, which, in turn, would bring price stability to dai.      In asset trading, market makers present buying and selling options across a wide range of prices. They make small arbitrage gains across large volumes while providing the market with much-needed liquidity. In other words, market makers help pricing.      Stability, of course, should be a feature of a stablecoin. Historically, dai and other less liquid stablecoins have lacked price stability compared to the most liquid stablecoin on the market, USDT. (Stablecoin price and volume data below via Nomics.)      “The result is that Dai will become significantly more liquid against any stablecoin that is onboarded as Dai collateral,” Christensen wrote at the time. “At scale, you can almost think of it as if Dai starts behaving like a fiat-backed stablecoin itself, in that it will be so easy to exchange it 1:1 with very low spreads to USD and fiat.”      All choices have trade-offs, however.      To add a stablecoin such as USDT would decrease Maker’s censorship resistance. A company, Tether Inc., is behind USDT, unlike dai, community members said. Companies can be censored or shut down; decentralized protocols can’t. Ultimately the team decided to refrain from adding USDT until the need for another asset became more apparent.      That day came six months later as the price of ETH tanked and dai’s price skyrocketed, hitting $1.22 on CoinGecko while accruing upwards of 20 percent interest on DeFi platform Compound.      The price jump left CDP holders paying extra to close positions along with difficulty in locating dai on the market. One week later, dai continues to sit seven cents above its peg while the Maker community jengas its token back to normalcy.      From a technical standpoint it’s likely the addition of USDC will work. Dai faced a similar issue in spring 2019 where dai sat about as far on the other side of the dollar as it currently does.      In response, the community voted to up the Stability Fee (interest given to dai holders) from 0.5 percent to 19.5 percent over multiple months. The 39-fold increase flummoxed some, but gradually restored the dollar peg by increasing demand to hold dai.      The rushed decision and addition of a decidedly non-decentralized asset to Maker’s ecosystem is another question entirely. Indeed, market participants in Asia woke up to the passed governance vote without being asked about its consequences.      Moreover, liquidity and undercapitalization are not the same thing, Messari’s Purdy said.      “It makes sense to get more dai liquidity, although it doesn't help the underlying undercapitalization issue,” he said about the USDC addition.      UPDATE (17, March 21:50 UTC): A previous version of this article included a supply chart for single collateral dai under the impression it represented multi-collateral dai.

42431636,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4YTh,1584451693,Overstock Hit by Two More SEC Subpoenas in December,"Overstock, the bitcoin-friendly retail company and the parent of security token marketplace tZERO, was subpoenaed twice by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at the end of last year.      As disclosed in Overstock’s annual report filed with the SEC on March 13, the company received the fresh subpoenas in December. Those came after one filed by the SEC two months earlier, which immediately pushed the company’s stock price down by 17 percent.      On Dec. 9, the e-commerce giant was hit by one subpoena requesting “documents related to the GSR transaction and the alternative trading system run by tZERO ATS, LLC,” the filing said. The transaction in question appears likely to be a $5 million investment in tZero from Chinese private equity firm GSR.      The troublesome deal, initially planned in 2018 as a $400 million purchase of tZERO tokens by GSR, kept shrinking as the buyer renegotiated it throughout 2019, finally closing last March as a far more modest $5 million in equity. Makara Capital, another company initially planning to invest along with GSR, backed off the deal, as Overstock reported in August.      Even the agreed upon $5 million may not have been paid in full yet. The filing indicates that by Dec. 31 GSR had provided only $4.4 million, with the rest to be paid by March 31, 2020.      The final SEC subpoena, filed Dec. 19, was related to Overstock’s “insider trading policies as well as certain employment and consulting agreements,” the filing says. The regulator has also been requesting Overstock's communications with the company’s founder and former CEO, Patrick Byrne, who quit his position and left the company in August.      Overstock is also still under investigation by the SEC regarding the 2018 sale of tZERO tokens. “We are cooperating with the SEC's investigation and have provided documents requested in the subpoenas,” Overstock said in the latest filing.      tZERO CEO Saum Noursalehi did not respond CoinDesk's request for comment by press time.    Earnings downturn    The end of the year didn't bring good news for Overstock in terms of its finances either. According to the annual report, earnings for its retail business fell over 20 percent compared to 2018. For the year ending Dec. 31, net annual revenue had dropped from $1.82 billion to $1.46 billion. Overstock’s online store has been the source of funding for all the blockchain subsidiaries of Overstock, including tZERO.      Plans to launch a digital stock marketplace together with the Boston Stock Exchange have also been pushed back. The SEC extended the review period for a proposed rule change for the second time on Jan. 16, the report says. The Boston Stock Exchange submitted an amended filing on March 9.      Overstock’s blockchain subsidiary tZERO was launched last January, after raising $134 million in a security token offering. From the start, though, volumes have been light on the platform, which is constrained by the same rules that apply to traditional securities trading platforms.      tZERO launched its own crypto trading app and listed Overstock’s Digital Voting Series A-1 Preferred shares – a digital security – last summer. The company paid dividends on the blockchain shares soon after.      In September, an investor launched a class action lawsuit against Overstock, Byrne and the firm's former chief financial officer, Gregory Iverson, over how the dividend payout was structured and how Byrne had sold his own shares of Overstock when departing.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/17/overstock-hit-by-two-more-sec-subpoenas-in-december,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f4cd38d596d490e171df16362b69f56e97c745e8-2502x1520.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431633,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4YRh,1584446400,Gemini's Nifty Gateway Bets on Celebs to Drive Interest in Crypto Collectibles,"The “Bitcoin Billionaire” twins, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss of the Gemini crypto exchange, now also have a regulated, fiat marketplace for non-fungible tokens (NFTs).      Gemini first acquired Nifty Gateway in late 2019 with Tyler Winklevoss saying in a statement, “We believe that both real-world and digital collectibles will migrate onto blockchains in the form of nifties.” (Winklevoss declined to offer further comment.)      Nifty Gateway founders, the twin brothers Duncan and Griffin Cock Foster, launched the Nifty marketplace on Tuesday, leveraging Gemini infrastructure on the backend for a dollar-exchange platform. People can buy NFTs with credit cards and cash out directly to their bank accounts when they sell.      To start, the collectibles exchange is working with mixed martial arts fighter Cris Cyborg and photographer Lyle Owerko, whose patrons include Justin Timberlake, Beyonce and Jay Z.      “I’ve known Tyler and Cameron for a few years now. We met socially in New York, through friends,” Owerko said. “It’s fun to be an early adopter. … It’s like being a painter in the 1880s and seeing a camera for the first time.”      He’ll offer a series of six images through Nifty’s marketplace for $200 to $2,500 each, depending on the image. Some images will have 25 copies available while others only have one NFT.      “I did this of my own volition,” Owerko added when asked if the company paid him for lending his art to this format. He said this deal was “mutually beneficial.”    Market headwinds    Since the platform expects to make revenue from transaction fees, Nifty Gateway would need to attract enough volume to support the five-man team within Gemini. It remains to be seen if there’s enough consumer demand for such digital collectibles.      The Nifty Gateway team estimated NFTs were a $200 million market in 2018, wrongly predicting the collectibles game CryptoKitties would remain a “project to watch” in 2019. CryptoKitties now attracts fewer than 200 weekly users, according to DappRadar, down from the 2017 peak of 14,914 daily active users. The NFT market is still seeing dismal growth in traditional tech terms. Nonfungible.com estimates the gaming startup Decentraland is one of the top three NFT market leaders yet facilitated roughly 50 transactions in the past week.      By comparison, the Nifty team’s initial experiment with 10,000 “Crypto Punk” NTFs garnered roughly 3,569 transactions in two years, meaning fewer than half of them sold and few of them traded. On the other hand, OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer said his NFT marketplace now sees roughly $1.5 million in monthly trading volume, with a little under 10,000 active user accounts. With the Ethereum network buckling under congestion from coronavirus-induced volatility, Finzer said this may increase transaction fees the platforms pay for each swap.      “If the Ethereum network remains super clogged, developers may just not build NFTs anymore,” he said. “Then more NFT projects may move to other main chains.”      Indeed, CryptoKitties creator Dapper Labs is making progress on its forthcoming Flow blockchain, debuting a test environment for developers earlier this month.      Given the instability among Ethereum’s fan base, the Cock Foster twins are looking to tap into celebrity fandoms, hoping to launch NFTs with more athletes and artists with devoted followings.      “In the art world you don’t really see Picasso’s trading cap or trading volume,” Duncan Cock Foster said. “We’re also working on Nifty display devices. … People have to be able to hang their NFT up on their wall.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | FLOW,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/17/geminis-nifty-gateway-bets-on-celebs-to-drive-interest-in-crypto-collectibles,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d95bb9a714567c8fa99c4610e9109cd7ffd1903-1400x1050.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431654,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4Yzh,1584445500,"Bitcoin Is Now Undervalued, Suggests This Price Metric","View  Bitcoin's MVRV Z-score suggests the cryptocurrency is underpriced and could be trading near a major bottom.  Short-term technical charts indicate scope for a test of price resistance near $5,900.  A violation of an ascending trendline support on the four-hour chart would expose the recent low below $4,000.    A key metric suggests bitcoin (BTC) is now trading at a relatively discounted price, having dropped by 60 percent in the last three weeks.      Bitcoin’s market value to realized value (MVRV) Z-score fell below zero on Friday and stood at -0.18 as of Monday, according to crypto analytics firm Glassnode. The metric is used to to identify periods where the cryptocurrency is under- or overvalued      The Z-score has turned negative for the first time in 12 months, suggesting the cryptocurrency is now undervalued.      Bitcoin topped out at $10,500 in mid-February and fell to a 12-month low of $3,867 on March 13, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      The cryptocurrency suffered a staggering 39 percent drop Thursday as the coronavirus-led sell-off in the global stock markets triggered margin calls and forced investors to liquidate their positions in bitcoin and other markets including gold and U.S. Treasurys.    Calculating MVRV Z-score    Bitcoin’s market value refers to the total dollar value of the supply in circulation, as calculated by the daily average price across major exchanges.      Meanwhile, the realized value approximates the value paid for all coins in existence by adding the market value of coins at the time they last moved on the blockchain.      The latter is closer to fair value as it adjusts for lost coins and those being held for the long term (so-called HODLing). As such, the MVRV Z-score essentially represents the distance or deviation from the realized value.    Bottoming out?    Historically, a below-zero MVRV Z-score (green area) has marked market bottoms, while a reading above 7 has marked tops.      For example, bitcoin fell below $6,000 on Nov. 14, signaling an extension of the sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017. It had dropped to $3,400 by Nov. 25.      The Z-score also turned negative in the second half of November and declined to -0.51 by mid-December. The sell-off ran out of steam near $3,100 in December and, after some consolidation, broke into a bull market in April.      Essentially, the ebbing of downside momentum was reflected in the Z-score’s negative turn.      Going back further, the 2014 bear market, which began at highs above $1,000 at the end of 2013, ran out of steam near $150 in January 2015 with the Z-score falling to -0.50. Again, after consolidating for some months, the cryptocurrency broke into a bull market in November 2015.      So if history is a guide, the current MVRV Z-score of -0.18 suggests the cryptocurrency could be trading near a bottom.      At press time, bitcoin is trading in the green near $5,335, representing a near 18 percent gain over 24 hours.    Equity futures rebound    The recovery may be associated with the positive action in the U.S. stock futures and the Asian and European equity markets. Notably, futures on the S&P 500, Wall Street’s equity index and the benchmark for global equities, rose nearly 5 percent early Tuesday, triggering a “limit up”.      Bitcoin has recently been tracking action in the equity markets and could continue to do so in the short term. From a technical perspective, though, there is scope for an extension of the ongoing recovery rally.    Daily chart    Bitcoin created a hammer candle on Monday, validating oversold conditions suggested by the 14-day relative strength index. A hammer comprises a long lower wick with a small body, and occurs when the sellers fail to keep prices at the lowest point of the day. Essentially, it represents seller exhaustion.      As a result, a move to the $5,900–$6,000 range may be seen in the next 24 hours or so. That range has recently capped upside in the cryptocurrency.    4-hour chart    Buyers need to prevent a break below the ascending trendline support, currently at $4,672, which would negate a bullish higher low at $4,435 that formed Monday.      A violation there would shift risk in favor of a drop to $4,000. The chart shows the area above $5,900 has proved a tough nut to crack for the bulls over the last four days. As a result, a sustained move above that level is needed to invite stronger buying pressure.      Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

The Zug, Switzerland-based group supporting the blockchain and cryptocurrency project confirmed in a blog post Monday that Z/Yen had initiated legal proceedings against it.      ""It is our obligation to inform the Cardano community of legal proceedings recently initiated by the Z/Yen Group Limited (UK) against the Cardano Foundation (Switzerland),"" the foundation said.      The dispute revolves around a reported agreement between the two organizations that the foundation allegedly terminated or voided for reasons not disclosed in the blog post.      ""The Cardano Foundation fully rejects the claims raised by the Z/Yen Group Limited,"" the blog post reads, adding it would not provide any further information while proceedings were underway.      However, the agreement in question appears to be one made in December 2017, when the foundation partnered with Z/Yen's Distributed Futures practice for collaborating on new research papers, as well as exploring potential applications for Cardano and its ADA cryptocurrency.      At the time, Michael Parsons, the foundation's then-chairman and executive director, described the Z/Yen partnership as ""extremely important."" He said the two organizations would work together on the ongoing development of new tools and functionalities that would help increase industry understanding of governance and regulatory issues.      In February 2018, the Cardano Foundation's official Twitter account posted about an event run by ""our research partner"" Z/Yen, for exploring how quantum computing could be used for blockchain security. Later that year, Z/Yen announced plans to experiment with smart ledgers for administering pension schemes, which would be sponsored by the Cardano Foundation according to a press release.      Charles Hoskinson, founder and CEO of IOHK, a Cardano developer, said the lawsuit is a ""commercial dispute"" and a ""leftover"" from the former administration of the foundation. He added that none of Z/Yen's research had been used in the Cardano protocol.      Z/Yen's co-founder and executive chairman, Michael Mainelli ,told CoinDesk neither he or Z/Yen were able to comment on the legal case while it was undergoing judicial consideration.

42431645,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN4Yfh,1584437400,Swedish Central Bank Bids to Host BIS Hub for Digital Currency Research,"Sweden’s Riksbank says its digital currency researchers are the best in central banking.      That lofty claim comes in Riksbank’s March 3 bid to host a Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub, an initiative by the ""bank of central banks"" that wants to scatter the world with local financial innovation policy clearinghouses.      One of the Hubs’ fields of study is sure to be central bank digital currencies. And there the Swedes, who are weeks into a long-term e-krona pilot project that report writers toiled over for years, are sure they’ve got a “comparative advantage” over the “tough competition” – “other central banks.”      The innovation hub is not an average non-governmental organization, the Swedish bid shows. It's actually a BIS outpost: an extrajudicial annex within whatever country one pops up. As such, Innovation Hub employees, and activities, are granted immunity from local prosecution.      “Given that the Riksbank has already come a long way in analyzing CBDC, it can, just as BIS requires from a hub, quickly supply analyses on the basis of already established collaboration between the public sector, private sector, academics and other central banks,” the petition said.      With the formal launch of the e-krona pilot, Sweden joined a fast-growing arena of central banks actively toying with digitizing some form of their money, including China, Cambodia, South Korea, Switzerland, Ukraine.      But in many respects Sweden is years ahead. Riskbank began seriously looking into a CBDC in 2017 when it decided something had to be done about its citizens’ rapid move away from physical cash. In consecutive reports it outlined many of the CBDC talking points – technology, policy, purpose – on which other central banks are just now getting started.      Riksbank now thinks its knowledge base makes it a strong contender to host an Innovation Hub, and it’s asking two key players – the Swedish parliament and the BIS – to agree.    Hosting a hub    It’s not free to host. Riksbank is asking parliament to allocate SEK 30 million ($3,203,500) a year for five years of Innovation Hub operations, which represents about half of Riksbank’s annual BIS equity dividend. Riksbank controls about 3.2 percent of BIS stock.      Riksbank sees this as a worthwhile investment, however. Its citizens are eschewing cash whether or not an Innovation Hub comes to town, and “there will still be a need to analyse financial technology developments in the payment market” if Sweden is not selected.      BIS declined to discuss its selection process.      The clash over hosting an Innovation Hub comes at a pivotal moment for the BIS and central banks in general. Just last week BIS signaled its belief the world’s payments landscape is rapidly changing with a quarterly report entirely dedicated to that digital future.      Against this, private stablecoin initiatives are posing a potential threat to central banks’ hold on monetary policy and financial stability - if the bakers’ public comments are any indication. In the bid documents Riksbank says Libra has triggered a wave of new action, even though its own CBDC dreams long preceded the stablecoin’s 2019 inception.      “After Facebook announced its intention, in partnership with a large number of companies, to introduce a global digital currency – Libra – central banks around the world have understood even more the need to cooperate to meet the challenges faced and take advantage of the opportunities offered by digitalisation to the global financial system,” the report sad      That’s spurred a lot of new activity, and, as Riskbank notes, a lot of interest in hosting a BIS Innovation Hub.      “In other words, there is tough competition for the other hubs that BIS will establish,” the report said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/17/swedish-central-bank-bids-to-host-bis-hub-for-digital-currency-research,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bfb8bb740dfa9866cedf6d15aba29b6141c4b7aa-1420x915.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a deal that primarily caters to mobile crypto buyers in the U.S., the Opera-Wyre partnership brings Apple Pay functionality to iOS and debit card integration to Android. It lets users of either system purchase up to $250 in bitcoin or ether daily, for a 30 cent fee plus a 2.9 percent transaction commission, Opera’s Head of Crypto Charles Hamel told CoinDesk.      That’s not a very high ceiling, Hame said, but it’s meant to appeal to dapp developers and day-to-day users, not investors and speculators looking to move well over $250 in crypto a day.      “As our browser-based wallet is focused around the usage of cryptocurrencies on the web and using dApps, we expect the vast majority of transactions will not hit that limit,” he said.

The browser has already taken strides towards that goal, adding TRON support, an Ethereum dapp-compatible desktop version, crypto mining protective layers and a wealth of other built-in blockchain features that other leading browsers only offer through third-party extensions.      Opera already supported bitcoin payments through its native wallet.      On-the-go fiat on-ramps make it yet more simple for Opera’s dapp-using community to interact with blockchain projects, Hamel said.

She has a PhD in business economics from Harvard.      The MakerDAO network is currently in a state of peril. The rapid drop in the price of ETH – which fell from roughly $200 on Wednesday, March 11, to a low of roughly $95 on March 12 (and it has since hovered around $110-$120) due to global market turmoil – reduced the value of the DAI’s collateral and triggered automatic liquidations. The already-clogged ethereum network could not quickly process additional collateral deposits by Vault holders, and the automated bots of Keepers, who play the role of liquidators, were not calibrated for the sudden increase in gas prices.      Some reports suggest that a stuck oracle triggered unnecessary liquidations even after the price of ETH rebounded. At least one enterprising Keeper successfully purchased auctioned ETH from Vaults for $0, resulting in a mass deficit (initially $4 millon, and now $5.7 million as of March 16) for the MakerDAO system. The situation is still actively developing as of the writing of this column; for more, see previous Coindesk articles.      Crises like these are the worst nightmare of the founding teams of decentralized platforms. Many would consider MakerDAO’s current situation to be the result of an impossible-to-foresee “black swan event” in ETH markets or broader crypto markets. They would argue there was no way to plan in advance for such a situation to be managed. After all, the entire point of a “black swan event” is that its occurrence and timing cannot be reasonably anticipated ahead of time.      See also: MakerDAO Debts Grow as DeFi Leader Moves to Stabilize Protocol      However, even though this particular crisis could not have been foreseen, there are steps the Maker team could have taken to prepare for these unknown unknowns. This situation, while still actively developing, highlights that those teams who design DeFi networks cannot treat economic and governance design as “optional future TBDs.” They must proactively consider all possible (covarying) risks, assuming that users will behave in their own best interests, and make it a priority to implement governance systems that are robust to these sorts of crises.    What is governance?    As we have written about previously, the governance of a blockchain platform is distinct from its operational structures and rules.      When founding teams design blockchain platforms, they spend most of their time focused on the operational structures. These are the mutually agreed upon rules and processes put in place to help manage the day-to-day functioning of the platform and the interactions that users have with each other. For example, algorithms that assist in determining the next block in the chain, and the size of the block rewards granted to validators, are components of the operational structures. Many components of economic design, such as contract and marketplace design, fall under this category.      Governance, in contrast, is the set of mechanisms by which the stakeholders collectively make choices regarding changes or updates to a platform’s operational rules, and to make decisions regarding events that the operational rules do not address. If operational rules consist of all of the written procedures and agreements in black and white, governance is the set of processes that help us address the grey areas in between.    It is better to address these issues beforehand, rather than trying to repair the damage and pick up the pieces after.    From an economic point of view, governance is essential in any blockchain platform because market conditions inevitably change and black swan events are unavoidable. No matter how thorough or well thought out a system design is, or how well-specified the algorithms of a platform are, there is always some future twist or turn that will cause users to need to change the rules of the protocol. In a firm or organization, executive leadership typically takes this role. In a decentralized blockchain platform, the community must have processes in place to take equivalent collective action.      Well-designed governance has many parts. There need to be clearly defined rules regarding the scope of problems the governance system can address; how proposals for actions are collected; who is allowed to participate in any voting or decision-making; how results are communicated; and how any decisions are enforced. A core component of any well-designed governance process is crisis governance.    What can MakerDAO teach projects about crisis governance design?    The MakerDAO community continues to discuss and debate the best path forward. As this crisis resolves, there are several lessons blockchain projects can take as they proceed with their own governance design.      Crisis governance will be more necessary than founders think.      For founders of platforms who give so much to their projects, it can be difficult to contemplate their users could potentially exploit the platform for their own personal gain. However, founding teams need to plan for a crisis occurs and not all users are on the platform’s side. A well-defined, pre-specified plan for crisis intervention by a set of trusted stakeholders is often necessary.      See also: ""Rune Radio,"" CoinDesk's Most Influential profile of MakerDAO impresario Rune Christensen      A core stakeholder role on the MakerDAO platform is the Keeper. From MakerDAO’s white paper, a Keeper is “an independent (usually automated) actor that is incentivized by arbitrage opportunities to provide liquidity in various aspects of a decentralized system. In the Maker Protocol, Keepers are market participants that help Dai maintain its Target Price ($1): they sell Dai when the market price is above the Target Price, and buy Dai when the market price is below the Target Price.”      As the price of ETH dropped and Vault liquidations were automatically triggered, Keepers could participate in auctions to purchase ETH from the liquidated Vaults. These auctions typically have multiple Keepers submitting bids, and effectively result in competitive exchange rates between DAI and ETH. But, given the high volume of liquidations, at least one Keeper was able to successfully bid 0 DAI for Vaults’ liquidated ETH over a 2-3 hour time period, fueling the multi-million dollar debt (AKA “negative system surplus”) that the platform is now trying to resolve.      Before this crisis, a founding team might argue that no individual Keeper would bid 0 DAI even if they could, because it would hurt the MakerDAO system’s credibility and reputation. However, when disaster occurred, this concern for communal well-being was not sufficient incentive to prevent one or more of these Keepers from taking advantage of the fact that they were the sole active Keeper in liquidation auctions.    Founding teams don’t want to contemplate that their projects might be faced with crises and might need to have levers to intervene rapidly.    Crisis governance needs to be well-specified in advance of the crisis.      MakerDAO was previously considered a strong project and a beacon of DeFi. Venture capital firms purchased over $34 million of the MKR governance token in late 2019, signaling confidence in the Maker platform. However, this crisis situation has revealed the extent to which certain aspects of the Maker system – namely crisis governance procedures – were not fully specified.      MakerDAO’s white paper notes the holders of MKR tokens – the platform’s governance token -- and the MakerDAO Foundation have the option to engage in an emergency shutdown. However, the specific parameters under which these parties could – or should – elect to shut the platform down were not specified. Stakeholders who were unable to deposit additional collateral in their Vaults because of congestion in the ETH market were confused about whether a shutdown would occur, as well as whether they would be compensated by MakerDAO for losses from automatically triggered liquidations if the platform continued to run. The community continued to be confused even after clarifying blog posts were posted by the MakerDAO leadership, as evidenced by the MakerDAO chat forum and subreddit.      Although the Maker team is now considering (and actively making) changes to the platform, the interim confusion caused significant distress in the community and a lot of time invested in determining next steps. Many stakeholders are now aggrieved because they feel they were liquidated unfairly and with a much higher penalty than the previously advertised 13 percent liquidation penalty.      Crisis governance may need the power to change fundamental platform parameters.      See also: DeFi Leader MakerDAO Weighs Emergency Shutdown Following ETH Price Drop      The choice of parameters for Vault liquidation auctions gave Keepers the opportunity to effectively get something for nothing. Instituting a reserve price, or minimum bid, for auctions of ETH liquidated from Vaults could have prevented ETH being sold for 0 DAI. Prior to the crisis, the Maker team had discussed the design of minimum bid increments, but to our knowledge had not considered a minimum bid.      An alternative to shutting down the platform would be to allow crisis governance to more quickly adjust fundamental platform parameters, such as the minimum bid in a liquidation auction. A crisis decision-making process that allowed the Maker team to quickly implement a minimum bid of DAI for ETH could have potentially mitigated the current situation. Specifying carefully not only the crisis governance process, but also what elements of the platform the process can address, can have a large impact on its efficacy.      It can be difficult in the early phases of platform design to have the tough conversations about in-the-weeds governance design. Hopeful founding teams don’t want to contemplate that their projects might be faced with crises and might need to have levers to intervene rapidly.      Without specifying these processes in advance and giving them sufficient flexibility and power, founding teams will be vulnerable to unexpected (yet not impossible) events like the ones we saw this week. As tough as it may be, it is better to address these issues beforehand, rather than trying to repair the damage and pick up the pieces after.

Binance and India-based bitcoin exchange WazirX – which Binance acquired in November – announced Tuesday their new ""Blockchain for India"" fund would incubate and invest in local startups that contribute to the creation of a sophisticated cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem for the subcontinent.      The new fund comes weeks after the Indian Supreme Court lifted a central bank-imposed ban that prevented cryptocurrency businesses from accessing financial services. Some exchanges added support for bank account transfers within hours of the court ruling.      The new Binance-backed fund, which will make investments in both equity and token acquisitions, is especially interested in initiatives that help develop a full crypto market infrastructure for India, according to a press release. That could include fiat gateways, remittance platforms, stablecoin solutions and new applications for decentralized finance (DeFi).      Worth a total of $50 million, the fund will make investments anywhere between $100,000 and $5 million.      Highlighting that India had one of the largest developer and software engineering talent pools in the world, WazirX founder and CEO Nischal Shetty said in a statement the new fund would make full use of the ""incredible potential that the Indian blockchain ecosystem has to offer.""      The new fund would be open to collaborating and co-investing with other local funds sharing the same goals, Shetty said. There will also be an initiative for supporting blockchain development and incubator programs in Indian universities.
