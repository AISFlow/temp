The first sell-off trend started when the Feds announced an interest rate hike in July 2022. Even though the Terra Luna crash worsened the situation, the market was already on the brink of collapse. Many people panicked and didn&apos;t want to pay high interest on their crypto gains. Since then, the Feds have come up with many unfavorable decisions in the inflation fight.

Users of the COMP protocol receive cETH when they deposit ether onto the platform.  cETH was initially introduced in early 2020 and was one of the first tokens used for yield farming, or the practice of staking or lending crypto assets in order to generate high returns or rewards in the form of additional cryptocurrency.  Compound says the code in the proposal, which aimed to update the price feed, was audited by three separate teams.  A fix is coming in the next code proposal, but it will take seven days to go into effect.  “All users should still be able to add collateral, even ether collateral.

Newly released visitor logs show that Bankman-Fried; Eloria Katz, FTX’s director of government relations and policy; and Mark Wetjen, an ex-CFTC commissioner who is now FTX’s head of policy, visited in mid-May with Biden administration policy adviser Charlotte Butash and counselor Steve Ricchetti. The logs did not detail the subject of the meetings.  FTX currently has a proposal before the CFTC that this agency should settle certain crypto-related transactions directly. This application has been staunchly opposed by the traditional finance (TradFi) industry.  During a hearing before the U.S. House Committee on Agriculture, which oversees the CFTC, Terry Duffy, the chief executive of CME Group, said FTX’s proposal for direct settlement was something “that's fraught with danger.""  “The risk of this going into other markets is extremely detrimental,"" he said at the time.

42373923,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWN7R,1661896385,Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Poised to Spike by Most Since January Amid Colder Weather,"The difficulty of mining bitcoin (BTC) is expected to grow by around 9% on Wednesday as miners in North America begin ramping up production ahead of the cooler months.  It will be one of the biggest upticks since August 2021, when miners began to come back online after the industry was banned in China, which at the time was home to 44% of mining activity.  Bitcoin’s difficulty adjusts automatically to keep the time required to mine a bitcoin block to roughly around 10 minutes, depending on the amount of computing power on the network. The higher the hashrate, a measure of computing power, the higher the difficulty; similarly, as hashrate drops, so does the difficulty level.  So far this year, the network difficulty’s highest increase was in January (9.32%).  This time, the metric will grow by around 9% to reach around 31 trillion, according to estimates from Bitrawr, Coinwarz and Luxor’s Hashrate Index. That’s very close to the metric's all-time high of 31,25 trillion on May 5, according to data from mining pool BTC.com.  Analysts speaking to CoinDesk agreed the uptick in the hashrate and difficulty are a result of more and newer machines coming online, as well as the waning impact of heatwaves.  “The post-summer network hashrate boom is a result of more efficient hardware being delivered, summer temperatures falling in the U.S. and old-generation machines being delivered to low-cost regions,” said Ethan Vera, chief operating officer at mining services firm Luxor Technologies.  Read more: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty: Everything You Need to Know  New seasons  The hashrate of the Bitcoin network dropped in mid-July as miners in North America powered down during heat waves that swept through the continent. Besides requiring a large amount of energy to run their computations, mining rigs produce a lot of heat during their operations, which means companies need even more energy to cool them down.  But during these same hours, demand for energy across the grid also spikes, as people and businesses turn on their air conditioners. In some energy markets, miners can sell power back to the grid, thereby making more money by turning off their machines than they would by earning crypto.  Some industry insiders, including Vera of Luxor, say that we could be seeing the start of a new seasonal trend in bitcoin mining. Prior to China’s ban on the industry in May 2021, the hashrate would increase during the rainy season in Sichuan from May to October, when miners in the country would take advantage of low-cost hydroelectricity.  As many miners have since moved to Texas, bumping their energy consumption in the state to about 1.5 gigawatts (GW), where temperatures run hot in the summer, the opposite trend might emerge. “Network difficulty drops in the summer months, with sharp increases occurring in the fall and winter months as miners come back online,” Galaxy Digital wrote in its mid-year mining report, released last week.  Read more: Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Drops as Miners Feel the Texas Heat  New machines  Simultaneously, in the last month new technology has been deployed across facilities. “A lot of machines have come online in the last month, increasing bitcoin's seven-day average hashrate from 210 EH/s to 226 EH/s (a 7.6% increase). This increase comes from miners plugging in new models, like the Antminer S19 XP, which miners began receiving in batches starting in July,” said Colin Harper, head of research and content at Luxor Technologies.  However, older-generation machines coming online in other countries also increased the hashrate: “When bitcoin price fell in [the second quarter] of this year, many miners in North America and Northern Europe unplugged their mid-generation machines. They then began the shipping process to low-cost regions such as Venezuela, and those machines are starting to get plugged in,” Vera said.  As more of the newer-generation machines come online, the trend will likely continue, said Kevin Zhang, senior vice president of mining Strategy at Foundry, a company also owned by CoinDesk’s parent firm, Digital Currency Group.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/30/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-poised-to-spike-by-most-since-january-amid-colder-weather,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42373953,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWRdz,1661891811,Alchemy-Backed Blockchain Company Contribution Labs Raising $3M in Equity Sale,"Contribution Labs is close to raising $3 million in an equity sale, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. The startup created the Polygon blockchain-based Mint Kudos, a Web3 platform that rewards community participants with digital badges.  Contribution Labs declined to comment.  The filing shows that Contribution Labs has raised $2,4 million toward its goal from two investors since the offering opened on Aug. 15. The offering involves a simple agreement for future equity, or SAFE, an arrangement where an investor pays cash now to receive equity in a company at a later date.  The SEC filing didn’t specify the investors involved in the offering. The Contribution Labs Notion team workspace page includes a list of investors, though the timing and amount of these investments isn’t provided.  Elad Gil, an entrepreneur who previously worked at Twitter (TWTR) and Google, is listed as the lead investor. And the venture capital arm of Web3 infrastructure giant Alchemy was also on the list, while Mint Kudos appears under the investment section of Alchemy’s website. Alchemy raised a $200 million equity round in February at a $10.2 billion valuation.  Read more: Alchemy Acquires Web3 Educational Platform ChainShot to Onboard Developers  Mint Kudos allows Web3 communities to reward contributions through a unique, peer-verified non-transferable token (NTT), according to the website. A Kudos is sent by adding the recipient’s crypto wallet address and describing the contribution to help the platform algorithmically generate an appropriate badge image. The platform then provides a link to the Kudos.  An NTT is essentially a non-fungible token (NFT) that can’t be traded or sold, the reasoning being that a Kudos recipient could build an on-chain reputation trail out of the badges.  Contribution Labs was founded in January by Catherine Chang, a former product manager at software company Atlassian, and Kei Yoshikoshi, a former engineer at Microsoft’s Azure blockchain. The beta version of Mint Kudos went live in April. The company’s near-term plans could include bridging the Kudos token to additional blockchains such as Ethereum, according to the website.

42373962,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWRqZ,1661891402,Market Wrap: Bitcoin's Price Retreats Along With Stocks,"Price Action  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) both fell on Tuesday.  Bitcoin declined, a reversal from the previous day. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap was down 1.8% on the day, falling 0.4% during the 13:00 UTC hour on higher-than-average volume.  Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was down 1% on Tuesday, also on higher-than-average volume when measured against its 20-day moving average.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Global Macro: Germany’s harmonized inflation rate was 8.8% for August, versus analysts' estimates of 9%. The harmonized rate allows for the comparison of inflation rates across countries in the European Union.  Although it came in below estimates, the rate is a 50-year high for Germany, increasing the possibility of more rate hikes to stave off inflation. A look at the hourly charts for both BTC and ETH show a sharp decline during the 12:00 UTC hour coinciding with the data release.  In the U.S., job openings for July were 11.24 million, versus estimates of 10.5 million. The news reflects continued tightness in labor markets, which is historically a catalyst for higher inflation.  Expectations for higher inflation increase the probability for continued rate hikes that generally lead to declines in the prices of risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.  Altcoins recently fell, as well, with polkadot (DOT) and uniswap (UNI) both down 3.2%, while AAVE was down 2.2%.  U.S. Equities: The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite were down 1.1%, 0.92% and 1.1% respectively. The three indexes each opened in negative territory and continued to trade lower throughout the day.  Commodities: Crude oil and natural gas were down 5.2% and 2.8% on Tuesday. The price of gold, a traditional safe-haven asset, declined 0.8%, while copper futures fell 1.6%.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  BTC moves into potentially oversold territory  Bitcoin resumed a downward trend after the pause described in Monday’s Market Wrap. The cryptocurrency continues to trade in tandem with other risky assets.  The correlations between BTC, the S&P 500, DJIA and Nasdaq Composite are 0.68, 0.58, and 0.83 respectively, highlighting the strong relationship between BTC and the indexes. Correlations range between 1 and -1, with 1 indicating a direct relationship and -1 implying an inverse relationship.  BTC’s price has moved into oversold territory as its relative strength index (RSI) has fallen to 30. The RSI indicator measures an asset’s price momentum. Values above 70 imply that an asset is overbought, while values below 30 imply that an asset is oversold (i.e. undervalued).  BTC’s 10-day exponential moving average (EMA) remains below its 50-day EMA, following a moving average crossover on Aug. 19. Moving average crossovers occur when the shorter period moving average crosses the longer period moving average and imply the potential end of a trend.  The previous 10-day and 50-day EMA negative crossovers occurred on April 11, Nov. 25, 2021, Sept. 21, 2021, May 12, 2021 and April 23, 2021. The corresponding RSI’s were 28, 46, 28.9, 34 and 27.8.  In four of those five occurrences, the change in BTC trend from positive to negative came when BTC had either breached or was approaching oversold levels. The price performance 30 days after each instance, however, was -27%, 53%, -28% and -32% respectively.  Even though the RSI indicates that BTC is oversold, prices going back to 2021 have adhered more to the change in trend to the downside than they have to the indicator itself. BTC prices are 6% below where they stood during the Aug. 19 crossover.

Rather than placing a bet through a sportsbook such as, say, FanDuel, where he was once CEO, Eccles said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” he wants to build a global clearinghouse for the gambling industry using decentralized liquidity pools.  Eccles said Tuesday his Scotland-based startup wants to operate as an exchange “where people can put up the bets they will take … and the bets they will meet ...”  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Sin Week.  Eccles said BetDEX is looking to cut out the middleman and reduce counterparty risks. In the past, some betting platforms have left users stranded before they can get their payouts, he said.  Read more: Criminal Crypto Use Is Growing, but That’s Just Half the Story  Thus, to avoid the need for a “bookmaker” or centralized party, Eccles said, his company decided to build on the Solana-based protocol Monaco.  ""The idea with BetDEX is that it's decentralized ... [A]nyone else can build on it, anyone else can trade on it permissionessly,” Eccles said.  The global sports betting industry is expected to grow to upwards of $182 billion in revenue by 2030, according to data from Grand View Research. FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried said last year it was “mind boggling” that sports betting did not happen more frequently on two-sided exchanges rather than centralized sportsbooks.  In an effort to ensure the protocol has enough liquidity, BetDEX has focused on international markets for its funding, with an emphasis on soccer. Last year, the company raised $21 million in a seed funding round.  Read more: In Defense of Crime  To build liquidity, Eccles is looking to bring on other parties to “build on the Monaco protocol,” sharing liquidity among those involved. BetDEX is also looking to expand its digital presence in Europe, Latin America and the Far East markets.  While BetDEX looks to develop its protocol and receive full regulatory approval, users can build and deploy tests on the Monaco protocol, which Eccles said has the same underlying technology as prediction markets, which are based on trading of a future event that has an uncertain outcome.  There is no clear launch date for BetDEX, but Eccles said the company’s protocol could launch around the time of soccer's World Cup, which is due to kick off on Nov. 20.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/sinweek/2022/08/30/betting-platform-betdex-labs-likes-the-odds-for-its-decentralized-sports-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/52da9b5b1976b80ed9d2a098bcce3dbdba9bb0b3-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421465,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoPkL,1661886089,What to Make of the Avalanche Whistleblower Report,"Ava Labs, the crypto development group behind the Avalanche blockchain and AVAX token, is under fire after a supposed investigative report showed how the firm allegedly staged a series of class-action lawsuits to attack competitors.  On Aug. 26, so-described whistleblower site Crypto Leaks posted a lengthy expose that claims Ava Labs paid crypto-focused law firm Freedman Roche in tokens and equity to file this adversarial litigation. Ava CEO Emin Gün Sirer has called the allegations “categorically false.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The post includes short, surreptitiously recorded videos of the law firm’s founder, Kyle Roche, describing how he used the U.S. legal system to draw regulatory attention like a “magnet” against alternative layer 1 blockchains including Solana and Dfinity and protect Avalanche’s interests. He also discussed his close professional and personal relationships with Ava and its founders, as well as his financial stake in Avalanche.  The report, if true, is damning and shows that anti-competitive behavior is alive and well in crypto. There are, however, several reasons to remain skeptical about the allegations. Right now, the pursuit of truth has reached a he-said-she-said stage – where it seems like all parties are withholding some facts – that only tarnishes crypto’s reputation.  The central claims of the investigation cannot be disproven by a third party – that Ava weaponized the legal system may well be true – and need further verification. But some aspects of the report show clear bias. Whether you think that reduces the reporting to mudslinging is up to you, but there are clear factual problems.  When judging the veracity or authenticity of something, small facts matter. I think it’s significant that Crypto Leak’s investigation had to be updated to reflect that Gün Sirer, a former Cornell professor, had left the university. This was announced publicly months ago, when the computer scientist decided to go full time on his private ventures.  See also: The Educator-Entrepreneurs of Crypto  That update further alleges that Gün Sirer possibly left under nefarious circumstances, which is unsubstantiated. This matters because the whistleblower is building a profile of Gün Sirer who was supposedly bitter for not achieving tenure, suffered from “Satoshi envy” and … is possibly “a sociopath.”  You cannot fault a whistleblower for dramatics. But instead of leaning on the actual spy-cam footage, it brings in circumstantial evidence that only undermines its believability. The reporter thinks it’s significant that Roche has failed to update his LinkedIn page to reflect he’s living in Miami – possibly as a tax dodge – or that he works with Ava Labs.  Small examples of motivated reasoning add up, and should cast a shadow of doubt. However, for this same reason, you have to be skeptical of Ava’s immediate defense – which hangs on the investigation being funded by rival blockchain project Dfinity. (Roche Freedman has sued a Dfinity linked organization for “securities violations” and insider trading.)  There’s circumstantial evidence that suggests a relationship exists between “The Internet Computer” and Crypto Leaks, including that its previous reports were defenses of Dfinity against Solana and the New York Times, but there are no clear financial flows.  It’s also significant that in their responses to the investigation, Ava Labs, Emin Gün Sirer and Roche have yet to acknowledge Ava’s support of Roche’s “tokenized litigation” platform Ryval – which undercuts claims that Ava only worked with the law firm in its early days. The platform was designed to cryptofy lawsuits, allowing people to invest in the outcome of cases, and was publicly supported by Ava Labs in late 2020.  We’re left with a series of highly edited videos, filmed by an unknown party and acquired through unknown means, showing a lawyer making braggadocious claims about his practice and peer group. We have a lawyer who claims to have been deceived and “intoxicated” by a Norwegian venture capitalist and crypto founder that is downplaying his relationship to his lawyer.  Both Roche and Emin Gün Sirer have stated Ava Labs had no insight into Roche’s “plaintiff side practice,” which doesn’t entirely waive away the possibility they were more closely related than they claim. But you have to ask what benefit would it bring for Ava or Roche to sue Binance, or other crypto exchanges like Coinbase (COIN) and Kraken, as planned?  See also: Binance.US Accused of Misleading Investors in Class-Action  Roche’s words speak for themselves. He sued “for sport” and for insider information, a fact that only came to light after loose-lipped talking. And his career is likely finished, his reputation burned for getting himself in this mess. He cannot deny appearing on film, over multiple days, even if he was duped into speaking under false pretenses.  Then there’s the question of strategy: Did Ava actually think it could benefit ultimately by getting regulators to investigate their rivals for securities violations, despite basically running the same token game? The situation suggests self-cannibalization across-the-board, including the probability that Dfinity is funding mudslinging against its rivals.  Of course, this is all really just speculation based on speculation. Of course, lawyers do not always put their client’s interests first. And of course, crypto projects do not always act with honor and distinction. No claims in this sordid little drama seem out of the question.  The story is developing, more information will come to light. Question it all. And maybe rue the fact that even if Avalanche unethically paid lawyers to attack its competitors the project is bigger than the egos behind it, who might win either way.

42421816,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwAA9,1661885974,What Is a Rug Pull? How to Protect Yourself From Getting ‘Rugged’,"Savvy investors are always looking for projects in their early stages that appear to be bound for success. If you’re lucky, getting involved early could result in huge returns – just ask the Winkelvoss twins, who invested in bitcoin (BTC) nearly a decade ago and have since become billionaires. On the other hand, “aping” into a project without doing thorough research can end in financial disaster, such as those who were lured by the Baller Ape Club non-fungible tokens (NFT) and collectively lost $2.6 million to scammers.  This appetite for high-risk, high-reward investment is particularly prevalent in the crypto space, where a steady stream of new projects builds buzz and encourages new investment. But unlike regulated financial markets, the crypto ecosystem is still in its early stages, and bad actors continue to find new ways to trick unsuspecting investors into making bad decisions.  One common scam in the crypto space is called a “rug pull,” where a developer or creator will promote a project such as a new coin or NFT release and then disappear with investor money. The perpetrators of rug pulls are difficult to track down after the fact, as the decentralized and pseudonymous nature of blockchain allows those involved to conceal their identities.  Still, there are ways you can detect possible rug pulls and protect yourself from financial loss.  What is a rug pull?  Ever heard of something being “too good to be true?”  The term “rug pull” comes from the phrase “pulling the rug out from underneath.” Many of these illegal schemes appear legitimate and enticing until the minds behind the project decide to suddenly drain investor funds.  Rug pulls have been observed across the crypto landscape in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFT), Web3 and various metaverse projects. In 2021, rug pulls took over $2.8 billion worth of cryptocurrency from victims, according to Chainalysis – accounting for 37% of all cryptocurrency scam revenue in 2021.  The emerging DeFi space is prone to rug pull scams because of the lack of intermediaries involved in transactions and the potential for massive returns. Additionally, many new cryptocurrency projects start out in the same place – a new, attractive token will emerge and investors will pour money into the project hoping that it rises in value – making these types of scams even more difficult to detect early on.  “Rug pulls are prevalent in DeFi because with the right technical know-how, it’s cheap and easy to create new tokens on the Ethereum blockchain or others and get them listed on decentralized exchanges (DEX) without a code audit,” Chainalysis explains. Code audits allow third parties to conduct security checks, ensuring that any smart contracts associated with the token are free of vulnerabilities.  Rug pull scams are also common in the NFT space, where heightened interest in crypto art and a constant influx of new projects have created an attractive environment for scammers. Many new collectors are still figuring out how to navigate the space, and popular projects like CryptoPunks have yielded millions of dollars in returns for early investors.  How to stay safe from rug pulls  Rug pull scams may not always be obvious, though there are ways to better detect these types of fraudulent projects and keep yourself safe.  Favor established projects  Many new projects don’t have a track record to prove their legitimacy or safety. While choosing to invest in an NFT project like Bored Ape Yacht Club is not entirely without risk, the project has established trust within its community over time. Some (not all) scams will often lazily imitate features from other popular projects, signaling that the project may not have originality or long-term value for investors.  In addition, centralized marketplaces like Binance or Coinbase (COIN) have certain standards in place and only list assets that are legal and safe, though their listings are not an indicator of quality or potential for gains.  Research projects and their founders  While it may be tempting to jump into a hyped-up project quickly, there’s a reason a common refrain in the crypto space is to “do your own research.” It’s extremely important to thoroughly examine the project, its team and blockchain features before deciding whether to invest.  While founders of NFT or DeFi projects often keep themselves anonymous, that approach could also protect them from being held accountable in case the launch of the project goes wrong. In some cases, the founders may maintain a pseudonymous crypto identity that they will use for years across projects and accounts. If their identities are visible, be sure to check out their social media accounts and other available information to see if they interact with other known people in the space and have legitimate followers.  Many legitimate DeFi projects will also audit their smart contracts to ensure there are no bugs in their code, a promising sign to investors. However, this process can be expensive and time-consuming and audits are not a guarantee that a project cannot be tampered with down the line.  In addition, it is also helpful to look through a project’s website, Discord channel, roadmap, white paper and associated materials to look out for anything that seems suspicious.  Be wary of projects promising high returns  Any project that promises sky-high returns should be carefully considered because DeFi scammers need liquidity to fund their scheme. Staking rewards and yield farming are two common features in DeFi ecosystems that scammers might seek to exploit or make false promises on.  See Also: How to Spot Crypto Pump-and-Dump Schemes  List of notable rug pull scams  Here are some of the largest rug pull scams to date, which can help you recognize patterns and red flags as you research investments:  OneCoin:  In 2014, self-proclaimed “crypto queen” Ruja Ignatova and others set up a Bulgarian-based cryptocurrency company called OneCoin Ltd. Ignatova and her cohorts allegedly made false claims about the coin and its perceived value to solicit investments.  Ignatova disappeared and the exchange shut down without warning in 2017. In total, the platform is believed to have defrauded victims of over $4 billion.  She has been charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit securities fraud and securities fraud, and was added to the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted list in June 2022.  Thodex:  Centralized Turkish cryptocurrency exchange Thodex was founded in 2017 and had amassed about 400,000 users, according to state news agency Anadolu.  In 2021, the exchange halted its users’ ability to withdraw funds and founder and CEO Faruk Fatih Ozer disappeared soon after. Users reported that certain cryptocurrencies, including dogecoin, were trading at much lower prices than other markets the night before the exchange shut down.  In total, users lost over $2 billion worth of cryptocurrency, according to Chainalysis.  Bloomberg reported in March that Turkish prosecutors are pursuing jail sentences for the exchange’s founders and executives, including Ozer, who is still missing.  AnubisDAO  The dog-themed DeFi project launched in 2021 and claimed to have been backed by several assets. The team behind the project launched a Discord server and Twitter account but had no website or white paper.  The project raised nearly $60 million worth of ether (ETH) from investors in its initial token sale to fund its liquidity pool in exchange for the project’s ANKH token. Less than 24 hours into the sale, the liquidity in the pool was sent to a different address, the project’s main Twitter account went offline and ANKH’s value plunged to zero.  According to Chainalysis, it’s unclear whether or not the developers were in on the scam, though it added that “all signs point to a standard rug pull.”  Frosties  The colorful NFT collection was announced in 2021 and quickly became popular, promising long-term utility and staking features. In January 2022, the 8,888-edition NFT collection sold out and, according to the U.S. Department of Justice, two men behind the project shut it down soon after and transferred the funds to various cryptocurrency wallets under their control.  The pair appeared to be planning to launch another NFT project called “Embers” prior to their arrest.  In total, the men allegedly earned $1.1 million and were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering in March 2022. “[We] advise consumers to pursue emerging investment trends with diligence and skepticism,” the DOJ wrote in its release.  Baller Ape Club  In September 2021, Vietnamese national Le Ahn Tuan funded an NFT project called Baller Ape Club, promising holders benefits like a VIP lounge and exclusive rewards.  According to the indictment, when investors tried to purchase the Solana-based NFTs, they were falsely told that their transaction had failed. Shortly after, Tuan and his co-conspirators allegedly shut down the project early and stole $2.6 million worth of SOL from investors without ever providing them with the NFTs promised.  The stolen investor funds were then allegedly laundered through a process known as chain-hopping, where one coin is converted into another across multiple blockchains.  Tuan was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit international money laundering in June 2022.  SudoRare  In August 2022, the developers behind a new decentralized NFT marketplace called SudoRare drained the project’s liquidity pool six hours after going live, stealing over 514 ETH, or about $815,000 at the time. They also deleted the project’s social media channels and websites.  Final thoughts  While DeFi protocols continue to be targeted by scammers and hackers, there are ways to prevent yourself from investing in fraudulent projects. In addition, law enforcement agencies and regulators are continuing to crack down on crypto scammers, showing a broader interest in holding scammers accountable and discouraging bad behavior.  Ultimately, none of these methods is 100% foolproof and we advise you to always use your best judgment. In addition, be sure to secure your accounts and educate yourself about other types of crypto scams in order to navigate the space safely.

42373958,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWRlX,1661883902,El Salvador’s Bitcoin Bond Delays Continue; Investor Interest Wanes: Report,"El Salvador’s so-called Volcano Bond offering continues to face delays from a lack of investor interest and a legislative holdup, according to a report in Fortune.  President Najib Bukele announced plans to raise $1 billion via bonds backed by bitcoin (BTC) in November, shortly after El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender. The offering was initially supposed to launch in early 2022, but it has faced delays, at least in part, thanks to plunging bitcoin prices.  El Salvador's Congress also must pass legislation necessary for issuance of the bond, though President Bukele's New Ideas party has a comfortable majority in the legislature. Speaking with Fortune, Bitfinex and Tether Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino – who has worked closely with El Salvador on the bitcoin project – said government officials have told him to expect passage in September.  Should that happen, said Ardoino, he would expect another two to three months as enough time to have the Volcano Bond rolled out, suggesting the sale could come before the end of 2022.  El Salvador’s government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  In February, El Salvador Finance Minister Alejandro Zelaya said that the bond issue would take place between March 15 and March 20, but weeks later blamed the war between Ukraine and Russia for delaying the process. “We have the tools almost finished, but the international context will tell us,” he said at the time.  From last September to date, El Salvador has acquired 2,301 bitcoins for roughly $103.9 million, according to announcements compiled from Bukele. Those bitcoin are worth about $45 million currently. The most recent buy occurred on July 30, when the country purchased 80 coins at a price of $19,000 each.

42373949,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWRaD,1661883318,Can Privacy-Focused Bitcoin Projects Avoid OFAC Sanctions?,"The U.S. blacklisting of Ethereum addresses connected to the Tornado Cash mixing service raises uneasy questions about Bitcoin’s immunity to government meddling.  The oldest and most valuable cryptocurrency network has faced down the threat of transaction censorship before. In May 2021, Marathon Digital Holdings, a U.S.-based bitcoin mining firm, said it would exclude from the blocks it mined any transactions involving addresses sanctioned by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The initiative proved highly controversial and ultimately short-lived. Marathon CEO Fred Thiel eventually announced that the company would revert to traditional mining, the kind that doesn't discriminate between users, and reaffirmed his commitment to the Bitcoin ethos of decentralization and censorship resistance.  But OFAC’s action against Tornado Cash raises the stakes. Rather than sanctioning an individual or an organization tied to terrorism or drug trafficking, the agency has made it a crime for otherwise law-abiding users to use privacy-enhancing software to cover their tracks on the Ethereum blockchain.  Read more: ‘People Will Get Burned’: Matt Odell on the Long Road to Bitcoin Privacy  What if OFAC similarly sanctioned one of Bitcoin’s decentralized mixing protocols? Miners operating in the U.S. or jurisdictions where Washington holds sway might have a stronger incentive to block transactions sent to or from these mixers, the way Marathon briefly censored transactions involving sanctioned entities.  This is a problem Bitcoin developers have been working on for over a decade. Not only are they improving obfuscation techniques, but they are working on ways to make it harder to distinguish between a “regular” bitcoin transaction and one that has interacted with a mixer after the fact.  Bitcoin’s many mixers  Most bitcoin transactions are publicly available for all to see, and anyone with a block explorer, a software tool that provides information on cryptocurrency transactions, can review practically any bitcoin transaction that has ever taken place.  Mixers are software programs or protocols designed to thwart such snooping. When a transaction is sent through a mixer, it’s jumbled up with other transactions in order to sever the connection between sender and receiver.  Read more: Bitcoin Mixers: How Do They Work and Why Are They Used?  Just as a bank protects its customers’ financial activities, privacy tools like mixers are designed to protect Bitcoin users’ activities from prying eyes. Sure, some people take advantage of mixers for illicit purposes, but others just want to keep their financial activities, like charitable and political donations, for example, private. (Remember the Canadian truckers?)  Mixers provide that privacy, but they aren’t perfect. While it’s extremely difficult to trace the history of a mixed coin’s transactions before it got to the mixer, it is still fairly simple after the fact to see that a coin has been through a mixer. And that is where the censorship happens.  When users send their coins through a decentralized mixer, the process of mixing often generates a distinctive transaction output that makes it obvious a mixer was used. Questions about illicit activity naturally come up if regulators (or regulated entities like cryptocurrency exchanges) see too many of these quirky mixer transactions.  Decentralized mixers provide software for people to interact peer-to-peer. There is no centralized entity that holds the mixed funds, and so there is no one target for regulators to home in on. Instead, it is the resultant transactions themselves that are vulnerable to sanctions and censorship.  One solution is straightforward (but not always simple): Make mixer transactions look like regular transactions so that they can’t be targets for censorship.  Here are some of the techniques that bitcoiners are able to use in order to protect their privacy through coin mixing.  CoinJoins  CoinJoins are a way of mixing multiple bitcoin transactions to enhance privacy. Users send bitcoin into a pool where the coins are mixed with other bitcoin. Upon withdrawal, users receive the same amount of bitcoin as they sent in, but the origin of that bitcoin has been obfuscated by the mixing activity.  CoinJoins can be performed independently by a group of individuals through a wallet like Samourai or Wasabi that uses a centralized CoinJoining service or via a decentralized CoinJoining marketplace like JoinMarket.  The pitfalls: Although CoinJoins obfuscate a bitcoin’s transaction pathway, snoopers can readily determine a CoinJoin has taken place by looking at the Bitcoin blockchain. This raises censorship concerns as certain entities may choose to censor CoinJoin transactions in order to comply with regulatory mandates.  PayJoins  PayJoins are similar to CoinJoins and are based on the same principle: Two individuals mix their bitcoin, obfuscating the distinction between sender and receiver.  PayJoins and CoinJoins can be used together. In fact, CoinJoin wallets like Wasabi and Samourai also support PayJoins. A list of compatible wallets can be found on a PayJoin adoption Bitcoin Wiki page.  The pitfalls: The main catch with PayJoins is that they can be conducted only between two parties. That limits the number of PayJoin use cases. In fact, only a handful of wallets with fully functional PayJoin implementations exist. A limited number of implementations also means a smaller pool of fellow “PayJoiners” to collaborate with.  CoinSwaps  CoinSwaps allow two or more users to swap bitcoin by creating a set of transactions that (to an outsider) look like unrelated payments. Like their CoinJoin cousins, CoinSwaps confer privacy by obfuscating a bitcoin’s transaction pathway.  “Imagine a future where a user Alice has bitcoins and wants to send them with maximal privacy, so she creates a special kind of transaction. For anyone looking at the blockchain her transaction appears completely normal with her coins seemingly going from address A to address B. But in reality her coins end up in address Z which is entirely unconnected to either A or B,” developer Chris Belcher wrote in his initial CoinSwap design proposal.  Read more: Now You Can Try 'Teleporting' Bitcoin for Greater Privacy With CoinSwaps  The pitfalls: CoinSwap transactions currently look like multisignature transactions (instead of standard single signature transactions). This makes them conspicuous and vulnerable to potential censorship – a drawback they share with CoinJoins.  Privacy improvements are coming  Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade in November 2021 introduced features that have the potential to tackle many of the pitfalls mentioned above. Primarily, it will help to make coin-mixing transactions less obvious to anyone trying to filter them out.  Schnorr Signatures  Schnorr signatures were introduced in Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade, which took place in November 2021. They are a simpler and more efficient alternative to the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signatures that are commonly used today. Schnorr signatures allow a group of users to combine their signatures so that only one signature is used (a process called aggregation). From a privacy perspective, multiple signers make it difficult to accurately determine the identity of each signer.  MuSig2  Another benefit of Schnorr signatures is the ability to combine multiple public bitcoin addresses (public keys) into a single address. This can be achieved by using a signature scheme called MuSig2. When bitcoin is sent to these composite MuSig2 addresses, it resembles standard bitcoin transactions rather than multisig transactions. This is yet another way to enhance privacy by obfuscating the source of a transaction and by making a multisig transaction look like a regular single signature transaction.  MAST  The Taproot upgrade also integrated Merkelized Alternative Script Trees (MAST). MAST integration reduces transaction size and increases transaction privacy. This is done by concealing transaction spending conditions. Bitcoin has a feature called a timelock script that allows a sender to specify conditions under which funds can be spent (e.g. 1 bitcoin can be spent three days after receipt). These instructions are included in the transaction data, which potentially undermines privacy. MAST allows for better privacy by combining, hashing and thereby concealing these spending instructions.  Cross-input signature aggregation (CISA)  Cross-input signature aggregation is an exciting Bitcoin enhancement that hasn’t been implemented yet but is in the works. It’s a feature that will allow multiple inputs in a bitcoin transaction to share a single signature. Currently, each input in a bitcoin transaction requires its own signature.  The primary privacy benefit is it will make mixing activities like CoinJoins and PayJoins cheaper. With CISA, the fees for a CoinJoin are the same as the fees for a single transaction. Since CoinJoins are performed by groups, the fee for each member of that group is only a fraction of the total fee. In fact, the cost of a bitcoin transaction drops as the size of the CoinJoin group grows.  The hope is that cheaper CISA transactions will increase the use of CoinJoins, and the resulting increased use of CoinJoins will ultimately increase privacy for everyone.

42411085,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giC05p,1661879920,"The Sex Club, Tokenized","It’s a Saturday night somewhere in lower Manhattan, New York City. While partygoers, commuters and tourists scurry by a nondescript building, a few in-the-know slip in. Some wear black jeans, others wear latex, but they’re all heading up a few narrow flights of stairs and may well end up having sex with each other by night’s end (which actually comes in the early hours of Sunday morning.) It’s all quite physical, naturally, but these savvy, curious people are increasingly connected by more technological components than you’d think. More on that in a moment.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Sin Week.  Some things simply don’t translate into the digital space. You might believe a sex club is one of them, but Daniel Saynt is on a mission to prove that’s just not true. When the COVID-19 pandemic ushered in an era of lockdowns and a national fear of close contact, he seamlessly took his members-only club, NSFW, digital, hosting online meetups that are still popular, even though his real-life clubhouse in downtown Manhattan is back up and running and physical clubhouses are expanding to other boroughs and the organization is in the process of considering cities like Los Angeles and Miami for more. Now, he wants to move even further into Web3: NSFW is branching into NFTs as a means for members to secure access to the club’s physical and digital spaces.  Before we get to that, there are a few things you should know about NSFW. Namely, the acronym doesn’t stand for what you think it does. Rather, it stands for the New Society for Wellness and the organization bills itself as “a members-only social club which caters to socially driven tastemakers and creatives.” That said, at NSFW events, you can expect a lot of sex. You can expect more than that, too, of course.  Also from Sin Week: David Z. Morris - In Defense of Crime  On a recent Saturday night I traveled to the clubhouse, where workers wore white, guests wore black, beds and swings and toys were abundant, and everyone was extremely friendly. The woman checking members in at the front door gave a verbal rundown of what else one could find in the four rooms ahead, helpfully pointing to the bathrooms and noting which contained a shower and which had a bidet.  In the front room, guests can play Jenga or admire a gallery wall adorned with artistic shots of naked bodies and a print of Rosie the Riveter announcing, “We can screw it!” In the second room, a wonderful bartender named Stephanie handed over a perfect vodka sour, another man sold weed next to a bookcase offering titles like ""Cock Paper Scissors""and ""Playing Well With Others,"" and a DJ played music.  We’ve had so many difficulties with MasterCard, Visa, Stripe, PayPal. None of them want to work with us.  The third room, a smaller space with some plush chairs and a swing attached to the ceiling with heavy chains, branches off the second by way of a door hidden behind one of the numerous massive beds, and the fourth room in the back contains more beds and a heavy wooden suspension frame with hooks for ropes. (Some ropes were available but members can, of course, bring their own.) On shelves throughout each room, there are bottles of lubricant and bowls of condoms. To avoid confusion and potential catastrophe, the lube and hand sanitizer bottles are clearly labeled.  CoinDesk sat down with Saynt in the fourth room a few hours before the weekly Kinklab performances began in the second. (This week featured pup and kitten performances; one duo performed in a small kiddie pool as the DJ blasted Doja Cat’s “Vegas,” with its apt, dog-themed lyrics.) Nearby, smokers gathered by a window that looked out onto other unassuming buildings where, presumably, occupants were unaware of what was going on in ours. This is not Daniel Saynt’s first entrepreneurial rodeo. He founded Fashion Indie, an online media network that incorporated Nylon magazine and once had 4.2 million users. NSFW now has more than 8,000 global members and a handful were already gathered at the clubhouse early that evening.  Read More: The Truth About Crypto and Sex Work  The black-clad guests mingled as Saynt explained, “NSFW came about as a place for exploration. It was always a community, in a sense.” What started about a decade ago as a way to bring people together to learn about sex and counteract the messaging from then-popular “50 Shades of Grey,” which depicted BDSM relationships in a way Saynt said was largely “so wrong.” He and his friends wanted to create a space where people could, for instance, learn about Tantra from skilled teachers, or find like-minded, accepting playmates among the roughly 7% of applicants who are accepted after a thorough but quick vetting process that includes reviews of social media presences but as membership grew, they quickly learned how many struggles are in store for entrepreneurs working in the sex space. Traditional payment platforms have been, historically, hostile to businesses and individuals in the sex work, and Saynt pointed to major credit card companies’ stances and the short-lived prude-ification of OnlyFans as examples.  “We’ve had so many difficulties with MasterCard [MA], Visa [V], Stripe [STRIP], PayPal [PYPL],” he said. “None of them want to work with us.” At present, members are joining from around the world, drawn to the digital components, the New York-based playspace, and the promise of physical expansion into other locations. They’ve recently had to secure their memberships through, of all things, Shopify, a Canadian e-commerce company that hosts online storefronts. Saynt sighed over the ethereal beats pumping through the dimly lit space, “We’re not doing anything bad other than bringing people together to teach them about sex. It sucks. We are considered porn. Because it’s sex, we are considered a risk.”  Shopify is cool and all and has certainly helped the club make transactions. Still, this is where he sees possibilities in Web3: “We’re really looking at the future of this company, the future of this community, and saying, ‘Well, what can we do with crypto? What can we do with a [decentralized autonomous organization]? Can we give full autonomy to the organizations and make decisions? Can we have our own currency and work with them?’”  The answer to each question is, of course, yes. This starts with shifting how memberships are doled out, and that’s where NFTs come in. Saynt wants “to have proper, smart contracts” with members, which the NSFW tokens will allow in addition to giving extra privacy to those members who, well, want extra privacy. You can’t take photos or use your phone deep inside the clubhouse because privacy and discretion are at the heart of the venture. The tokens signify membership, with each member holding one, and act as private, secure means of entry to all things NSFW.  The NFTs will limit membership, too. Within the next seven years, the supply of NFTs available to members will be capped. Anyone looking to join NSFW will need to purchase another member’s NFT, like a taxi medallion. Token holders will get access to events, the online community, and the nascent app. (The NFTs will be capped at 100,000. If you are so bold, you can apply to NSFW and get in on the ground floor by clicking this link).

Now, like any decentralized exchange, putting the native token to work by using it for swaps gives it utility, which has driven the price of BONE upwards. But now, the digital asset is on the move once more. BONE Exchange Listings Trigger Rise Just like Shiba Inu in its time, BONE is receiving a lot of support from the community during this time. Exchanges have moved to list the digital asset on their platform, and as expected, these have triggered a pump in the price of the cryptocurrency.

Sometimes, exchanges will hold voting competitions for different digital assets, and the ones with the most votes are usually listed on the exchange. The prospect of BONE being listed on Gate alone has set it on an upward trajectory. Then came the official listing on another crypto exchange called BlueBit. With both of these news driving more interest into the token, the price had surged more than 110% in the span of 48 hours.

In April last year, the Turkish government issued a warrant for the arrest of fugitive businessman Faruk Fatih Ozer, accused of fleeing with $2.0 billion in investor assets. Turkish authorities say the suspect is facing thousands of years in prison. Prosecutors claim he formed a criminal organization engaging in cyber fraud and money laundering via illegal activities. Thodex participated in the cryptocurrency craze triggered by local investors trying to safeguard their assets from rising inflation and a fluctuating currency. According to the charge for the prosecution, the exchange&apos;s collapse caused total losses of 356 million liras ($24 million). Thodex Developed Strong Investor-Attraction Activities Through an eye-catching advertising campaign with well-known Turkish models, it promised to distribute luxury vehicles. However, the Thodex market stopped trading in April after publishing a cryptic statement days earlier stating that it would take five days to handle an unidentified foreign investment.

Clockwork, which was formerly known as Cronos, aims to solve the automation dilemma, in which developers must choose between using decentralized apps (dapps), or apps that are automated.

Others have also tried to solve the automation dilemma. In August 2019, AWS backed a competitive service created by the VDF Alliance, a blockchain software firm, and supported by the Ethereum Foundation to decentralize automated blockchain cloud computing.

42411091,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giC0WH,1661869272,"Criminal Crypto Use Is Growing, but That’s Just Half the Story","A persistent knock on cryptocurrency is: “It’s only used by drug dealers and black market participants.” The old saw’s popularity might stem from general misconception (as we see plenty of licit uses for cryptocurrency these days), but its popularity is likely rooted in the first time most of us heard about crypto: For use on the Silk Road, an online black market and dark web web market.  Of course, someone writing about how crypto still is or isn’t used for illicit purposes widely doesn’t do much without hard data. Thankfully (at least for this specific purpose), the blockchains that power cryptocurrencies are largely transparent, and companies like Chainalysis, CipherTrace and Crystal Blockchain provide blockchain forensics services.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Sin Week.  And they have gotten really good at it.  Chainalysis, for example, releases an annual Crypto Crime Report that outlines the use of cryptocurrency across several types of crimes like ransomware, scams, violations of broad countrywide sanctions and terrorism financing. We dove into the 2021 report, which was published in February, to figure out how much truth there was in the notion that crypto is only being used by criminals. And while these are critically important types of crime to pay attention to, we are going to zoom in specifically on dark web marketplaces.  Here’s what the numbers have to say.  First, though, there are several interesting high points worth highlighting in Chainalysis’ report regarding the entirety of illicit activity that cryptocurrencies enabled. The punchline has been widely picked up by crypto supporters as an advertisement for adopting cryptocurrencies. After all, crypto should be terrible for crimes since every transaction you make is seared into a public ledger.  Read more: In Defense of Crime.  And, for the most part, the data does seem to support that.  In 2021, $14 billion in cryptocurrency value was tied to illicit activities. We aren’t really sure how much money is spent on doing illegal stuff, for obvious reasons, but it is probably a significant percentage (like, 22%) of the world’s $80 trillion of gross domestic product. Compared with $17 trillion, $14 billion is hardly a drop in the bucket.  That’s not really the point, however. The truth is that cryptocurrencies do still enable illicit activity, and the amount used grew between 2020 and 2021. In defense of crypto, the illicit share of all crypto transaction volume has fallen since 2019 and is at a scant 0.15% now.  So while the amount of illicit activity being funded through crypto is growing, the growth of legitimate crypto uses is far outpacing it.  That said, one of the main takeaways from Chainalysis’ work is that the majority (~53%) of illicit transactions in crypto in 2021 were tied to scams and stolen funds. While those are serious problems, these are problems that are intrinsic to both crypto and legacy financial markets. Where there is money to be made there are false promises and stolen funds.  So, instead, we should take a look at the thing that cryptocurrency supposedly supports in a unique way: the aforementioned “drug dealers and black market participants.”  Crypto and dark web markets  Dark web markets, the corner of the internet where illegal activity abounds, set a new revenue record in 2021, bringing in a total of $2.1 billion in cryptocurrency.  While the total value being transferred to dark web markets has grown rather quickly, the total number of transfers to these markets has fallen in the past five years, from 11.7 million in 2016 to just 3.7 million in 2021. The total number of users has also fallen. So absent growth in transfers and users, the driver of growth is found in bigger payments, with average payment size increasing from $160 to $493 over the same time period.  The next question is, “How is 2022 shaping up?” Glad you asked …  How 2022 is shaping up for dark web markets  Chainalysis provided an update to its 2021 report on Aug. 16 and the 2022 data has shaped up in an interesting way.  First and foremost, the amount of cryptocurrency value received by illicit entities in 2022 year to date (YTD) ranks below both the same period in 2019 and in 2021.  Zooming in on transaction volume for a more fulsome lay of the land, crypto transaction volume in YTD 2022 (for all uses) is tracking behind YTD 2021 through July. Directly from the Chainalysis blog:  “Overall, criminal activity appears to be more resilient in the face of price declines: Illicit volumes are down just 15% year over year, compared [with] 36% for legitimate volumes.”  The rest of Chainalysis’ update is focused on providing an update as to which illicit uses of crypto have seen increases and decreases in 2022. Of note, there has been an increase in hacking and stolen funds and a decrease in scams. More notably, however, there was a decrease in dark web market revenue.  The main driver of this decrease is likely due to the shutdown of Hydra Market, the world’s largest and most prominent dark web market, in April. German authorities shut down the Russian-based dark web marketplace, and the U.S. has gone further by adding hundreds of bitcoin (BTC) wallets to a sanctions list.  The decline in revenue suggests that authorities are getting better at detecting dark web market crime. But Chainalysis adds an important caveat:  “Vendors have taken more steps than ever to enhance their shipping anonymity, and buyers have begun to transact with these vendors directly. All of these trends point to a darknet market industry that is fast maturing.”  So while authorities are getting better at sniffing out dark web markets, dark web markets are getting better at not being sniffed out. Which brings us to a (potentially) important caveat about privacy coins to take into consideration while looking at this data.  Potentially important caveat  Privacy coins are cryptocurrencies that have privacy as a default option, which is markedly divergent from bitcoin and ether (ETH). The two most well-known privacy coins are monero (XMR), and zcash (ZEC). Privacy coins are incredibly difficult to trace, and although blockchain forensics companies advertise that they can trace some parts of ZEC transactions there is far less identifying information available. Monero, on the other hand, is incredibly difficult (impossible?) to trace (the IRS is even offering $625,000 to anyone who can crack monero).  As such, it would be expected of dark web markets to move away from transparent cryptocurrencies (like bitcoin) to something private (like monero). According to Chainalysis, XMR is seeing increased adoption among dark web markets, with 67% of dark web markets supporting it in 2021, compared to 45% in 2020.  That said, while XMR might be stealing market share from the other, more transparent cryptocurrencies, BTC still maintains support from 93% of all dark web markets, suggesting that bitcoin still rules in the dark web. So while some of the dip in value transmitted by dark web marketplace users can be attributed to opting for privacy coins, more of that dip should be attributed to authorities simply getting better at stopping crime and at blockchain analytics getting better.",NEUTRAL,BTC | XMR | ZEC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | XMR | ZEC,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/08/30/criminal-crypto-use-is-growing-but-thats-just-half-the-story,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b88f3bd02529b906ce58e139827e7346cf1e2adf-1707x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Switzerland-based lender will purchase $50 million worth of its native token over the next six months. This follows a previous buyback that saw it accumulate $100 million between November and May.  The Nexo token is currently trading at $0.982 with a market cap of $549 million, and has risen 4.35% over the past 24 hours.  Nexo has thus far managed to avoid the troubles experienced by rivals due to the grueling market downturn this year. Fellow lender Celsius Network filed for bankruptcy after freezing withdrawals in June, while former industry heavyweights such as Voyager Digital and Three Arrows Capital have suffered similar fates alongside a severe slump in the price of crypto assets.  “In these challenging market conditions, the NEXO Token has moved consistently with the likes of BTC and ETH,"" said Antoni Trenchev, Nexo co-founder and managing partner, in a press release. ""Right now, our investors and clients require solid ground to walk on, and our third token buyback ensures this added stability as we emerge from the latest market roller coaster.”  Once Nexo tokens are repurchased, they will be sent to the company's on-chain Investor Protection Reserve for a vesting period of 12 months, after which they might used for interest payouts on the platform or strategic investments via token mergers.  Following the difficulties faced by Celsius, Nexo expressed interest in buying assets, including customer data, from its distressed rival.

Market Moves  Ether, Bitcoin Could See Turbulence as Open Interest Leverage Ratio Soars to Record High  By Omkar Godbole  Traders love volatility and Ethereum's ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC) could soon offer plenty of it. That's the message from observers tracking the so-called open interest leverage ratio.  The metric is calculated by dividing the amount of dollars locked in open perpetual futures contracts by the market capitalization of the underlying cryptocurrency. The ratio represents the degree of leverage relative to the market size or sensitivity of the spot price to the derivative market activity.  Both ether and bitcoin's perpetual futures open interest ratios stood at lifetime highs above 0.03 and 0.02 at press time, according to data sourced from Decentral Park Capital and blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.  ""The rising ratio indicates open interest is outpacing market size and increases the risk of volatility due to future [long/short] squeezes,"" Decentral's researcher Lewis Harland said.  Perpetuals are futures with no expiry. A futures squeeze refers to a sudden and rapid move in an asset's price caused by bears or bulls abandoning their positions. A short squeeze is a rally fueled by sellers dumping their bearish bets (shorts). A long squeeze is a decline caused by bulls closing their bullish bets (longs). The higher the leverage ratio, the bigger the impact of long/short squeeze on the asset's price.  Crypto research firm Delphi Digital's Andrew Krohn voiced a similar opinion in Monday's client note, saying the ratio suggests that open interest is large relative to the market size and ""implies a higher risk of market squeezes, liquidation cascades or deleveraging events.""  The futures market involves leverage, meaning a trader can take a large long/short position by depositing a relatively small amount of money, called a margin, while the exchange provides the rest of the trade value. That exposes futures traders to liquidations – forced closure of long/short positions due to margin shortages often caused by the market moving in the opposite direction of the trade.  These forced closures put upward/downward pressure on prices, leading to increased volatility. The greater the degree of leverage relative to the market size, the bigger the risk of liquidations injecting volatility into the market.  Read the full story here.

42421456,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoPb3,1661867280,Digital Liberation: How Blockchain Can Be Sexy (and Safe),"It’s the year 2030 and sex work in the metaverse is booming. Digital users are leaning into their sexuality and exploring IRL (in real life) fantasies on an endlessly expanding menu of virtual experiences. Developers all over the world are making a decent (and at times opulent) living meeting demand for the technology, and platforms are looking the other way as long as it means more users and total value locked (TVL).  Flash back to 2022: The sex work industry is just starting to dip its toes into the blockchain, and the writing is already on the wall. Emerging tech is enabling creativity and innovation across industries, and it would be naive to assume those forces won’t eventually bring “the oldest profession” into a cypherpunkian utopia in some truly unique ways.  James Key is the CEO of Autonomy Network, a decentralized automation protocol designed for Web3 builders. This piece is part of CoinDesk's Sin Week.  After all, the adult entertainment industry has been an early adopter of new technologies. If the metaverse is meant to reflect people’s wildest fantasies, then sexual exploration will definitely be a part of the scene, as we’re already seeing in virtual dating.  What would a Web3 take on OnlyFans look like if anyone could create a sex worker avatar? What’s stopping someone from opening up a sex club in the metaverse? Can anyone date a digital version of a celebrity without their consent? After all, Lebron James and Ariana Grande are currently playable as licensed skins on Fortnite, but my guess is they aren’t clamoring to get their likeness on the “casual encounters” corner of an adults-only metaverse.  While the specific answers to these questions remain to be seen, there are certainly some ambitious developers working on some version of all these things at this very moment.  What is presently clear is that the business of sex relies on facilitating personal intimacy and privacy. No other industry places such a large premium on it. This presents a compelling use case for blockchain technology, both for back-end security processes and, perhaps more interestingly, NSFW metaversal encounters. One of Web3’s biggest value propositions is its ability to simultaneously enhance users’ privacy and online verifiability.  Crypto lover  Let’s talk about the power of data in the context of personal preference and privacy. For instance, the physical appearance of the female robot in the 2014 movie “Deus Ex Machina” was based on the protagonist’s porn search history, which comes across as an invasive overreach to most watchers. We encounter similar algorithms and machine learning tools that study our behaviors to manipulate our desires every time we use proprietary software, like Google Search. This is exactly what Web3 aims to disrupt.  It would be entirely possible to encrypt data reflecting someone’s sexual preferences into an on-chain avatar that evolves based on their changing preferences. This could be done without ever divulging any personal information or search history, in-platform or to outside parties.  Read more: Should Crypto and Porn Get Intimate? / Opinion  This avatar could then be applied to something like Vex Ruby, a virtual cam girl that engages with viewers in real time, or to create an interactive autonomous non-fungible token (NFT) like Alice, a GPT-3-powered virtual human that was auctioned off at Sotheby’s for nearly half a million dollars.  Alternatively, people’s custom sex avatars may also be discretely ported to an adult metaverse, where real-world sex workers could apply it as a skin when interacting with a client in a virtual setting secured by a privacy-enhancing blockchain network.  As virtual reality (VR) sexuality researcher Angelina Aleksandrovich puts it: “Sex workers can jump into any kind of avatar that the client wants to play with [in the metaverse]; they can change the world on demand and play out different scenarios that the clients want.”  All of which is to say, virtual reality will be key to creating many of the actual sensory experiences future sex workers and clients participate in, but blockchain technology will be key to making these experiences more individualized, accessible and secure.  Erotic encounters in the virtual realm are not beholden to the constraints of the physical world or even our own biological realities (see Viro Playspace’s “smokin’ hot dragon babe”), especially with the rise of haptic bodysuits and other sensory devices.  Safer play  Perhaps more importantly, VR can also be leveraged to help people safely experiment with their sexual identity and gender expressions. If so, it will be blockchain technology that helps ensure that participants on both sides of the market are kept safe while they explore, in terms of both physical wellbeing and desired level of anonymity.  After all both sex workers and clients want better ways to vet their counterparts while protecting their own right to privacy. Decentralized, on-chain reputation systems have more potential to address this issue than any other existing technology.  The point of applying new technologies to existing industries is to make future products and services fundamentally better in some enduring way – not for the sake of adding new bells and whistles. In that sense, blockchain’s role in enhancing the adult entertainment industry’s discovery process and quality of engagement – while enhancing participants’ safety and control – will be an interesting story to follow, even for individuals who aren’t participating in the space.

Alongside the increase in both understanding and trading in NFTs, the global market has continued to rise, predicted to reach an incredible $122.43 billion by 2028. With the expansion of NFTs beyond just digital art, also integrating into Play2Earn blockchain gaming projects and metaverse creations, this digital medium is set for a dazzling future. While progress has been impressive within the world of NFTs, their increased popularity also comes with a fairly hefty downside - rising gas fees when processing transactions. The vast majority of NFTs are minted on Ethereum, with their ERC-721 being the industry standard for creating new non-fungible digital assets. Although Ethereum&apos;s infrastructure provides a comprehensive ecosystem where users can create, distribute, and trade their acquired NFTs, the blockchain network itself has a notoriously low threshold for transactions per second, leading to high gas fees. While this was commonly understood as part of the territory when minting on Ethereum, the introduction of L2 networks promises to remedy this problem. With these developments, the longevity and sustainable growth of NFTs could be much more certain.

42373960,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWRo3,1661865634,Slow Ventures Raises Stakes on Crypto Governance with ‘Timber sDAO’,"The idealism of decentralized crypto ownership doesn't always play nice with the realities of U.S. securities law – especially when tokens and DAOs get involved.  Even so, crypto-savvy venture capital firm Slow Ventures is trying to make it work. Its partners have been building a playbook for designing crypto clubs whose members have real power to tokenize, own, govern and trade real-world assets as part of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) – attributes lacking from crypto’s better-known collectives, like ConstitutionDAO and LinksDAO.  Called sDAO, Slow’s framework isn’t for decentralization purists: It limits participation to a maximum 499 “accredited investors” in order to toe the legal line. Under federal securities law, only accredited investors who meet specific income or net worth requirements can participate in certain securities offerings. Such permissioned systems as sDAO fly in the face of free-for-all DAOs that theoretically let anyone with a governance token in.  Read more: What Is a DAO?  Even with the participation limit, Slow views these sDAOs as a potent way to drive reams of new investors into usually quiet asset classes, like land plots, where tokenized shares could attract a wider buying audience then – for instance – a paper deed.  “This is a novel structure that we think can act as a catalyst for bringing more real-world assets on-chain,” said Clay Robbins, a partner at Slow Ventures who is leading the firm’s work on sDAO. Once on-chain, he said, they can find much more liquidity.  Robbins’ early efforts to prove the sDAO concept have at least shown that some investors have an appetite for throwing money into wonky crypto governance experiments that have limited upside. His first iteration raised over $700,000 to buy a plot of land in Montana – a boring investment by design.  If sDAO's first round was about showing a DAO could own hard assets (land being the easiest hard asset to own, according to Robbins), then round two is where things start to get lucrative: land with trees.  “Land is easy but it's not really cash-flow productive,” Robbins said. “The next step is cash flow productivity which is why we’re moving to timber land.”  Trees can be sold as timber or preserved for carbon sequestration; in other words, they have the potential to generate a “modest diversified return” for members of “Timber sDAO,” Robbins said. The goal here, he reiterated, is more in “pressure testing” the sDAO template than in producing a home run investment.  Beyond introducing liquidity, the framework also is designed to let DAO members hold power over their property by holding votes over the course of the investment. For that, Robbins said that Timber sDAO will use a governance toolkit created by Nation, which serves DAOs on the Solana blockchain.  “A lot of the platforms today that allow you to launch DAOs are in my opinion not user-centric.” Nation co-founder Ryan Shea told CoinDesk in an interview. He said Nation is trying to build a more accessible launchpad that he thinks will bring more newcomers into crypto governance.  Getting the governance formula right has been a hard target to hit for many self-proclaimed DAOs. The term is at times more of a marketing gimmick than reality – even proponents of successful initiatives have told CoinDesk their DAOs are fraught with inefficiencies and disarray.  Read more: What DAO Governance Has in Common With the ‘Eggheads’ Who Call a Recession  If TimberDAO proves its pudding, flashier iterations should work well, too, Robbins said, as he expects sDAOs creators to “open source” the framework so that anyone can create legally compliant DAOs. He is hopeful that U.S. regulation will come around to DAO management models in the interim.  “Once we've sort of confirmed that we can do this without many hiccups we will open it up so anyone can do an sDAO,” Robbins said.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION | SOL,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/30/slow-ventures-raises-stakes-on-crypto-governance-with-timber-sdao,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc1b5e4b0e15355f71a7af408a07e5611c3f9cbe-5184x3888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Tokenproof, a token-gating platform, is building a way for NFT holders to prove they own their Bored Apes without putting that high-value NFT at risk. That utility is growing ever more important as real-world opportunities for holders to score ownership benefits – attending events, for example – explode, said CEO Alfonzo Olvera.  But every new integration comes with new avenues for exploitation from phishers and scammers angling to drain wallets. Users can often put their NFTs and other valuable assets at risk when connecting their hot wallets to the outside world, according to Olvera.  Read more: NFT Scams: How to Avoid Falling Victim  Threats of attacks on NFT communities, such as Bored Ape Yacht Club last month, have prompted products with NFT integrations to double down on security. Last month, Metaverse game company The Sandbox brought in BrandShield, a security firm, to protect users from NFT phishing scams, which according to a report from Elliptic have totalled over $100 million in the last year.

Bitkub Chief Technology Officer Samret Wajanasathian was ordered to pay a fine of 8.5 million Thai baht (around $235,000) and was barred from holding an executive position for 12 months by the country's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Although Wajanasathian's LinkedIn page still shows him as CTO at Bitkub, he's absent from the company's website.  Tuesday's order comes after the Thai SEC in May hit Bitkub with fines for failing to comply with local regulations before listing the platform's native token KUB. Last week, the country's oldest commercial bank, Siam Commercial Bank (SCB), backed out of a plan to purchase a majority of Bitkub, citing unresolved issues with the securities regulator.  The insider-trading case stems from an incident from last November, when the SCB acquisition plan was first announced. According to the SEC, Wajanasathian – armed with this information – bought 1.99 million Thai baht (roughly $61,000 at the time) worth of the KUB token. The price of KUB subsequently more than doubled immediately upon the public announcement.

42373947,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWRTv,1661862387,BNB Chain Introduces Liquid Staking to Provide Crypto Users Access to More Income Streams,"BNB Chain, the base blockchain of crypto exchange Binance, has introduced so-called liquid staking with three leading Web3 protocols: Ankr, Stader and pStake, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.  In liquid staking, users who have staked – or locked – their tokens for some use are issued new tokens with an equivalent value. The new tokens represent ownership of the underlying ones, are fully transferable and can be unwrapped to reclaim the staked assets. In the meantime, they can be used to generate yield, thus freeing up capital and making such products attractive to users.  Liquid staking is become more popular as Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain, proceeds toward becoming a proof-of-stake (PoS) system. Coinbase, a U.S. publicly traded crypto exchange, said last week it plans to offer its own liquid staking token, called Coinbase wrapped staked ETH (cbETH). It joins Lido Finance, which said in July it would soon offer staked ether on layer 2, or companion, networks.  With the BNB Chain introduction, users will be able to earn interest by allocating the BNB token to liquid staking protocols and receiving tradable aBNBc, BNBX and stkBNB tokens in return. Wombat Exchange has joined the liquid staking network to offer decentralized exchange trading facilities.  In addition, Helio Money is offering what it calls a ""destablecoin,"" which it says is a new asset class. The prefix “de-” stands for decentralized; it doesn't signify price volatility. While crypto-backed stablecoins are fixed relative to centralized crypto assets such as USDC, destablecoins such as Helios' HAY will use decentralized assets such as BNB as collateral. Destablecoins also differ from stablecoins in achieving stability broadly without an absolute peg to the fiat currencies.  Earlier this month, liquid staking protocol pStake and Stader, a staking-as-a-service platform, went live on the BNB Chain, complementing Ankr, which provides a software development kit to help protocols offer token staking, according to the release. As of Monday, the three together staked 101,100 BNB, or $30 million, in total value locked.  Read More: Ankr Introduces Token-Staking Tool Kits for Yield-Hunting Communities  ""Only 24 percent of the total market capitalization of staking platforms is locked in staking,"" said Gwendolyn Regina, the investment director at BNB Chain. ""We believe that users are not yet fully aware of the benefits of staking. [It] reduces concentration risk by utilizing three competitive protocols to avoid a single point of failure.""

42373957,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvWRj1,1661859551,"Ether, Bitcoin Could See Turbulence as Open Interest Leverage Ratio Soars to Record High","Traders love volatility, and Ethereum's ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC) could soon offer plenty of it. That's the message from observers tracking the so-called open interest leverage ratio.  The metric is calculated by dividing the amount of dollars locked in open perpetual futures contracts by the market capitalization of the underlying cryptocurrency. The ratio represents the degree of leverage relative to the market size or sensitivity of the spot price to the derivative market activity.  Both ether and bitcoin's perpetual futures open interest ratios stood at lifetime highs above 0.03 and 0.02 at press time, according to data sourced from Decentral Park Capital and blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.  ""The rising ratio indicates open interest is outpacing market size and increases the risk of volatility due to future [long/short] squeezes,"" Decentral researcher Lewis Harland said.  Perpetuals are futures with no expiration date. A futures squeeze refers to a sudden and rapid move in an asset's price caused by bears or bulls abandoning their positions. A short squeeze is a rally fueled by sellers dumping their bearish bets (shorts). A long squeeze is a decline caused by bulls closing their bullish bets (longs). The higher the leverage ratio, the bigger the impact of long/short squeeze on the asset's price.  Andrew Krohn, an analyst at crypto research firm Delphi Digital, voiced a similar opinion in a note to clients on Monday, saying the ratio suggests that open interest is large relative to the market size and ""implies a higher risk of market squeezes, liquidation cascades or deleveraging events.""  The futures market involves leverage, meaning a trader can take a large long/short position by depositing a relatively small amount of money, called a margin, while the exchange provides the rest of the trade value. That exposes futures traders to liquidations – forced closure of long/short positions due to margin shortages often caused by the market moving in the opposite direction of the trade.  These forced closures put upward/downward pressure on prices, leading to increased volatility. The greater the degree of leverage relative to the market size, the bigger the risk of liquidations injecting volatility into the market.  Short squeeze ahead?  Other things being equal, the recent bearish positioning in the perpetual futures market suggests the scope for a short squeeze ahead. A short squeeze is caused by bears exiting short positions on the first evidence of price stability, which leads to a sharp rally.  ""Aggregate funding rates turned moderately negative for both assets mid-August, so crowded shorts may be at most risk,"" Harland told CoinDesk.  Funding rates refer to the cost of holding long or short positions in the perpetual futures market. An aggregate negative funding rate means shorts are paying longs to keep the bearish bets open and the net positioning is skewed bearish.  Ether to see more volatility than bitcoin  Ether may be more volatile than bitcoin in the coming weeks, because ether's leverage ratio is bigger than bitcoin's.  Besides, Ethereum's long-pending technological upgrade, dubbed the Merge, is due in mid-September. The upgrade is projected to cause a drastic reduction in ether's supply and bring a store-of-value appeal to the cryptocurrency.  Traders have employed various synthetic strategies that involve buying spot and selling futures in the lead-up to the Merge, inadvertently setting the stage for price turbulence at the time of the Merge.  ""We note this risk could be relatively higher for ETH than BTC, given the ratio is about 38% higher [for ETH] and consensus Merge momentum trades,"" Harland said.  Large ether options traders have been adopting an options trading strategy called a long strangle to profit from a potential volatility explosion in the coming weeks.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/30/ether-bitcoin-could-see-turbulence-as-open-interest-leverage-ratio-soars-to-record-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ee6e7e126a9b27a18fe535072ff724d3e401b7ae-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The country's financial regulator, the Financial Services Commission, prohibited local crypto companies from carrying out ICOs – a way of raising funds by selling digital tokens – in 2017. Now, the central bank is arguing in favor of regulating ICOs rather than forbidding them, saying the ban is not effective.  Regulators in South Korea are cracking down on the local crypto industry after the multibillion dollar collapse of crypto platform Terra, founded by South Korean native Do Kwon, earlier this year. In addition to investigating Terra, regulators have flagged other crypto platforms for allegedly flouting local regulations. The financial regulator has said it will be assisting in the acceleration of passing new crypto regulations.  Domestic companies like Terra circumvented the ban by issuing new digital tokens through corporations established overseas and listing those tokens on local exchanges, the central bank said in its report accompanying the Korean translation of the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation.  In the report, the bank said it is necessary to review the country's developing crypto regulatory framework, called the Digital Asset Basic Act, with reference to relevant examples from MiCA.  The central bank acknowledged MiCA's emphasis on regulating stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to the price of another asset like a sovereign currency. The Bank of Korea referenced Terra's failed U.S. dollar-pegged algorithmic stablecoin as an example for why South Korea should adopt MiCA-style stablecoin rules.

Fireblocks previously provided support for Solana’s native token SOL as well as stablecoins such as USDC on the network. Now, the the company's “Web3 Engine,” offers an on-steroids version of the platform’s key-sharding wallet technology to Solana users.  “It’s a very scalable wallet technology with a variety of use cases,” said Shaulov in an interview. “It could be used by an operations team to manage the treasury of the organization, or for Web3 retail applications, where a game can create wallets for its million users and serve them in a custodial way, with all the connectivity, controls and security to mint tokens and NFTs.”  Fireblocks connects to some 35 blockchain networks and works with an array of Web3 companies including Animoca, MoonPay, Xternity Games, Griffin Gaming, Wirex and Utopian Game Labs.

The other important thing this integration does is push support for the WalletConnect2 protocol across the Solana ecosystem,” Shaulov said. “It’s just a much better, more secure and more scalable way to connect with decentralized applications.

On August 29, Farooq said at a roundtable discussion at the Monetary Authority of Singapore&apos;s Green Shoots Seminar that regulation has not yet kept up with the expanding industry, which prevents many traditional financial (TradFi) institutions from participating. He stated, &apos;Most of crypto is still junk, actually.

A major event in the crypto industry, The Merge is eagerly anticipated by many. By combining with the Beacon Chain, Ethereum will implement a system based on proof-of-stake. This system will significantly reduce Ether&apos;s energy consumption. Despite the Merge&apos;s promises of a new tomorrow for Ethereum, investors continue to have poor faith in the currency. The price of ETH plummeted significantly below the $1,500 support line on August 28 and has been stuck in that border for the past two days. The expectations of traders are relatively modest. According to a source, trading volumes dropped by a shocking 45 percent on August 28. With a decrease in overall trading, transactions suffered a severe setback as well.

The letter follows one sent in July claiming the information provided by the social media giant was false and misleading.  While Musk offered to acquire Twitter in April, he put his plan on hold the following month, citing concerns about the number of spam or fake accounts on the platform. He scrapped the plan last month, claiming the information provided by the social media giant was false and misleading. Twitter's board, however, said it was confident the agreement would close, adding that it was prepared to take legal action to enforce it.  The new letter is ""delivering this additional termination notice in the event that the July 8 Termination Notice is determined to be invalid for any reason,"" according to the filing.  The letter is not legally necessary to terminate the agreement and the bases it sets out should be be regarded in addition to and not instead those in the July 8 letter, it said.  ""...

42422471,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0lR3h,1661850000,"DeFi Platform RedStone Raises Nearly $7M to Improve Connectivity Between Blockchains, Real-World Data","DeFi oracle platform RedStone has raised nearly $7 million to develop a faster, cost-efficient cross-chain oracle for decentralized finance protocols.  According to a Monday press release, Lemniscap led the seed funding round with support from Coinbase Ventures, Blockchain Capital, Distributed Global, Lattice, Arweave, Bering Waters, Maven11 and SevenX Ventures. RedStone, which currently delivers data feeds to more than 30 blockchains, including Ethereum, Avalanche and Polygon, will use the funds to expedite the rollout of its latest product suite with the aim of improving connectivity between blockchains and real-world data.  Lemniscap founder Roderik van der Graaf said in the release it’s important that essential DeFi infrastructure, like the firm’s cross-chain oracle, continues to evolve to support the sprawling DeFi sector.  “While the DeFi space continues to provide fertile ground for innovation, the foundational infrastructure has remained static over time, and is not fit for purpose in today’s rapidly scaling, blockchain-agnostic environment,” said van der Graaf.  Oracles are essential to the DeFi sector because they enable smart contracts to access real-time data, such as digital asset prices, eliminating the need for a central intermediary.  Read More: What Is an Oracle?  Redstone Oracle aims to offer quick and inexpensive connectivity by leveraging a proprietary method for putting data on blockchains, called the EVM connector. This method is intended to quickly and economically aggregate data from external sources like the foreign exchange market and price feeds for long-tail tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFT) and commodities as the data automatically attaches itself to a transaction and erases itself. Currently, RedStone Oracle passes data packages into transaction call data by accessing over 1,000 data feeds, which are updated every 10 seconds.  The company is also developing a more efficient framework for smart contracts to increase interoperability between blockchains and external data sources.  RedStone founder Jakub Wojciechowski said RedStone’s framework for smart contracts will be capable of processing more information, allowing the company's developers to improve on-chain-off-chain connectivity.  “We want to create a smart contract framework that will allow everyone to process large volumes of data,” Wojciechowski told CoinDesk. “That's something which is not possible in other spaces.”  Read More: Making Sense of Blockchain Smart Contracts",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED | AR,Elizabeth Napolitano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/29/defi-platform-redstone-raises-nearly-7m-to-improve-connectivity-between-blockchains-real-world-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e303160de7296f6b6346378b77c80d21f5de8baa-4267x3200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The bearish retracement in the NEAR prices forms a bearish wedge pattern accounting for a drop of 25% over the last two weeks. However, the recent bullish reversal within the bearish pattern projects the possibility of a bullish breakout. So, should you consider buying NEAR tokens before the bullish breakout? Key Points: The NEAR price action forms a bearish wedge pattern in the daily chart. The RSI slope shows a remarkable reversal in the nearly oversold boundary. With a market cap of $3.17 billion, the intraday trading volume of Near Protocol has increased by 8% to reach $227 million. Source - Tradingview NEAR Technical Analysis The NEAR prices display a falling trend in the daily chart after facing rejection from the overhead resistance of $6.5. The correction phase drops below the 100 and 50-day EMA, sabotaging the possibility of a bullish crossover. However, the recent increase in buying pressure fuels the bull cycle within the falling wedge, increasing the possibility of a bullish breakout. Furthermore, the hike in the intraday trading volume supports the bullish engulfing candle.

Bitcoin Returns to Its $20K Perch  By James Rubin  After taking a short Sunday dive, bitcoin returned to its new support level above $20,000.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $21,250, up about 3% over the past 24 hours. BTC's resilience offered a sliver of reinforcement for investors who thought the crypto's plunge to $19,500 was a precursor to a bigger drop stemming from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's vow to continue the U.S. central banks monetary hawkishness.  ""Macro [economics] has been in the driver's seat all year, and this week and after Jackson Hole, the market has been reminded that the same type of inflationary headwinds with strong job markets remain,"" Luke Farrell, a cryptocurrency trader for crypto grading firm GSR, told CoinDesk TV. ""You're seeing a little bit of a reassessment of the optimism that came after the CPI print last month and a bit of oversold conditions that started in June.""  Ether returned to its pattern of outperforming bitcoin, recently rising more than 7%. ETH is now changing hands well above $1,500 after falling well below this psychologically important level over the weekend. The second largest crypto by market cap has been rising more sharply than BTC over the past couple of months as the Ethereum blockchain nears the Merge, which will change the protocol from proof-of-work to more energy efficient proof-of-stake.  Other altcoins in the CoinDesk top 20 by market cap were in the green, most of them firmly so, with ATOM and LRC recently jumping 12% and 8%, respectively. AVAX rose more than 5%, regaining ground it lost after a self-described ""whistleblower"" website on Sunday accused Ava Labs, the company behind the Avalanche, the layer 1 blockchain, of paying lawyers to hurt competitors and keep regulators at bay. On Monday, Ava Labs CEO Emin Gün Sirer denied the company has been involved in any behind-the-scenes smear campaign.  Equity markets pointed down ,with the tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes off 1% and 0.7%, respectively. U.S. Treasury yields rose as nervous investors sold off government bonds. On Tuesday, the Conference Board releases its monthly consumer confidence index, a widely watched measure of sentiment about the economy. The group's last report in July found confidence waning, albeit at a more moderate pace than in June when inflation hit 9.1%.  In its weekly fund flows report, CoinShares noted a third consecutive week of outflows totaling $46 million. The report said that $29 million in bitcoin outflows made up the largest portion of this sum. ""[O]ur latest @CoinSharesCo fund flows report in two words: investor apathy. no near-term catalysts on the horizon and so we wait...,"" CoinShares Chief Strategy Officer Meltem Demirors tweeted.  GSR's Farrell said that volatility should remain ""heightened"" in the short term as markets await next month's release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Merge and the Federal Open Market Committee's next meeting, which now seems likely to produce another 75 basis point interest rate hike. ""There's a lot of different data points coming up for the market to consider and that means a little bit more volatility at for the short term,"" he said.

Insights  The Taipei Blockchain Conference's COVID Problem  By Sam Reynolds  Taipei – not Hong Kong, Singapore or Seoul — once played host to the greatest blockchain conference of all time. COVID-19 restrictions in Taiwan in the form of mandatory quarantine and a ban on non-residents from entering might stop the next one from taking place.  In the halcyon pre-COVID days of 2019, the Asia Blockchain Summit was a star-studded event that kicked off with the ""Tangle in Taipei,"" a debate between crotchety no-coiner Nouriel Roubini, a professor at New York University, and former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes. Moderated by Andrew Neil, then a prominent broadcaster at the BBC, the exchange was fiery and informative and a complete contrast to dull advertorial panels at conferences of the present tense hosted by venture capitalists pumping their bags. Hayes quotes from the conference ended up in the indictment against him, which is a sure sign of a 10x event.  Fast forward to 2022 and a different team wants to bring blockchain – now ""Web3"" – back to Taipei in the form of Taipei Blockchain Week. But as the crypto world has changed since 2019, there are now more considerations for international travel and conferences: COVID.  While Taiwan’s neighbors such as Singapore and South Korea are moving past pandemic-induced restrictions, Taiwan, despite its 90% vaccination rate and 50% booster rate, still has mandatory quarantine for all international arrivals (plus mandatory masking outdoors).  The current quarantine regime is three days of self-isolation and then four days of soft quarantine, where you are prohibited from doing anything but the essentials. Seven days after arriving in Taiwan you’re allowed to fully rejoin society, a schedule not exactly conducive for conference goers.  The government has been promising a reduction in quarantine for some time but keeps shifting the goalposts. Last year, the border opening was scheduled to happen when the first-dose vaccination rate hit 70%. Earlier this year the criteria was changed to increasing the child vaccination rate to 50%.  Now there’s talk of the border ""opening"" to tour groups by October but nothing about a meaningful reduction in quarantine. One local official with Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Center is quoted as saying that there were “political considerations” at play. A spike in coronavirus cases caused by a policy of allowing for inbound travel would be a liability for the incumbent party as the nation heads into its version of mid-term elections in November.  'Taiwan Gold Card'  For its part, Taipei Blockchain Week’s organizers seem undeterred.  “Taipei Blockchain Week will happen regardless of the borders reopening! We’re expecting borders to be more relaxed by the end of December,” said organizer Tiffany Lai via Telegram. “As a backup – we’ll be partnering with travel agencies and the government to help process business visas for speakers and attendees.”  One option organizers are exploring is to have attendees apply for a Taiwan Gold Card, a specific type of residency visa that someone can qualify for by demonstrating he or she has over $67,000 in income.  The program was designed to allow for businesses to easily bring in high-caliber foreign talent to help diversify the manufacturing-heavy economy. But it became a favorite for digital nomads looking for an island of normality during the peak of the pandemic in 2020. Since then the program has had trouble retaining individuals who have received these cards, mainly because Taiwan lags behind the rest of the world in re-opening post-coronavirus.  An entry pass for conference attendees wasn’t the intended use case of the Gold Card, but the presence of the Gold Card’s logo on Taiwan Blockchain Week’s website implies a tacit endorsement.  Eth Taipei, part of a network of worldwide Ethereum-focused events, was scheduled for December but canceled and relocated to India due to uncertainty over COVID quarantine rules in Taiwan.  “The travel situation was not clear and we need five months lead time to fundraise and handle logistics so decided to focus on India and swap locations,” its organizer said in a tweet.  Organizers of Taipei Blockchain Week have three and a half months to book speakers, secure visas and convince the world to come to closed-off-masks-on Taiwan for their event. This isn’t an impossible task, but it certainly will be a Herculean effort to pull off.
