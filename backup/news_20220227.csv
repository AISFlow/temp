EU foreign policy chief Joseph Borrell announced the European Council is in support of a decision to offer Ukraine lethal assistance on Sunday night during an informal video conference of foreign affairs ministers.  “We want to do everything to support Ukraine. We have decided to use our capacities to provide arms, lethal arms, lethal assistance to [the] Ukrainian army,” Borell said, adding that 450 million euro (around $500 million) of the support package to be discussed includes fighters, arms and fighter jets.  The EU’s move to support lethal assistance to Ukraine closely follows Germany’s historic decision to send 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger anti-aircraft defense systems to Ukraine.  Borell said that 50 million euros worth of non-lethal supplies, fuel and protective equipment will also be provided as part of the support package. He added that although political decisions cannot be made during an informal meeting, written procedure will follow.  European leaders have been working over the weekend to finalize decisions on sanctions against Russia after the country launched a full-blown military invasion of Ukraine on Wednesday. On Saturday, the EU committed to blocking some Russian banks out of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), the messaging network that connects financial institutions from around the world.  A Ukrainian journalist present at the briefing asked why only a number of Russian banks were being blocked from SWIFT.  Borell said that a country like Russia is strongly interrelated with other economies and thus cannot be completely disconnected from the global financial system overnight.  “This degree of disconnection is carefully calibrated in order to create the maximum damage to the financial system of Russia while keeping the minimum level of interconnection with other financial systems,” Borell said.  The names and number of the Russian banks to be disconnected are yet to be determined, Borell said.  “We'll have to wait for some hours. It’s not easy to decide these kinds of things and we are working against the clock because everything has to be done before tomorrow morning,” Borell said.  In addition to the weapons package, the EU has plans to ban a number of Russian state-owned broadcasting networks in the union.",NEUTRAL,없음,OTHER,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/27/eu-plans-500m-weapons-aid-package-for-ukraine-to-help-repel-russian-invasion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/edf56f6abe6d50c6305ec20d1895ad47bc482c1d-1024x728.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375230,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw6c0B,1645991631,New DAO Raises $3M in ETH for Ukrainian Army,"A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) has formed to raise money for Ukrainian soldiers facing down the Russian army.  UkraineDAO, a fundraising effort coordinated by members of the investment group PleasrDAO, the non-fungible token (NFT) studio Trippy Labs, and the Russian art collective Pussy Riot, has already raised over $3 million in Ethereum-based tokens.  The project is taking cues from other politically minded fundraiser DAOs, such as AssangeDAO (supporting embattled WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange) and ConstitutionDAO, which tried (and failed) to purchase an original copy of the U.S. constitution at auction.  UkraineDAO joins the Ukrainian government itself in asking for cryptocurrency donations to aid the resistance following Russia’s invasion.  Read more: Ukrainian Government Receives $5M in Crypto Donations After Russian Invasion  Alona Shevchenko, born in eastern Ukraine and currently based in London, created the Twitter account for UkraineDAO a few days before Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the invasion – “just in case,” she told CoinDesk.  “When I started getting messages from my friends in Ukraine saying that their cities are getting bombed, I messaged my friends from PleasrDAO,” she said. “And then so many amazing people jumped in to help me.”  Shevchenko returned from Thursday’s anti-war protest at 10 Downing Street to a Zoom call organized by PleasrDAO, where she found a team already assembled. The way she put it, UkraineDAO “self-organized super quickly.”  This isn’t Shevchenko’s first crowdfund; she currently works as the operations and community lead for FreeRossDAO, which looks to funnel crypto toward the jailed Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht.  UkraineDAO plans to use its official war chest (ukrainedao.eth) to support Ukrainian soldiers. Specifically, the group hopes to donate to a Ukrainian organization called Come Back Alive, which was recently banned from the fundraising platform Patreon for violating the site’s terms of service. Come Back Alive has separately raised about $6.9 million from bitcoin donations.  Ukrainian flag NFT  Before the ban, Come Back Alive was accepting U.S. dollar donations for the Ukrainian military; in a letter explaining its decision to block the crowdfund, Patreon quoted sections of the organization’s website, which pointed to “financ[ing] and train[ing] military personnel.”  The letter added that the company has refunded all donations – something that’s not possible in quite the same way with crypto.  Shevchenko called Patreon’s policy “delusional.”  “If you put yourself in the shoes of a soldier who is running out of basic weapons, who's not well equipped, who's not properly cared for, who's sacrificing his life, and you're telling us, ‘Oh, sorry, you can't donate to him because it's against our rules’ – to me, it's a crime to do that,” she said.  Read more: People Are Sending Millions in Bitcoin to Aid Ukraine's Military as Russia Advances  This weekend, the DAO released a one-of-one NFT of the Ukrainian flag, which it now plans to purchase (from itself) with the donated funds. It’s all happening through the fractionalized bidding service PartyBid, which allows for group NFT purchases. Donate to the group that ends up winning the auction, and you’ll receive a set of ERC-20 tokens proportionate to what you put in (in this case, LOVE tokens).  The process is complicated by the fact that LOVE could have real value; a contribution to UkraineDAO is as much a charitable donation as an investment in LOVE tokens, which can be bought and sold on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap.  It’s also possible that the PartyBid could lose the auction for the flag NFT, if a whale swoops in at the last moment. In that case, the funds would still go to UkraineDAO, but PartyBid contributors would need to reclaim their donations from the site: Come Back Alive would theoretically still get the money, but the funds in the group bid would be rendered meaningless. It’s a competitive donation scheme, rather than a cumulative one.  The DAO is also giving money to the NGO Proliska, and has suggested it might give to the Red Cross. But the way Shevchenko sees it, the contributions are best used militarily.  “All our help, realistically, needs to be thrown for the army,” she said. “If you don't stand up for our army right now, we will have no civilians to help.”  Read more: Ukraine Mounts Effort to Surveil Russian Politicians’ Crypto Wallets",POSITIVE,ETH,BTC | ETH | REGULATION,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/02/27/new-dao-raises-3-million-in-eth-for-ukrainian-army,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f56edf610b522914fb4b5c63963e372ccd3dc35f-5760x3840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On Friday, Fedorov asked Musk turn his attention away from space exploration for a bit to help his country stay connected to the internet as the ongoing Russian attacks threaten the nation's internet connectivity.     Russia launched a full-scale invasion on Ukraine on Wednesday. Since then, Western countries have come together to impose strict sanctions on Russia. After a move to block Russia from global banking system SWIFT on Saturday, President Vladimir Putin put the country's nuclear force on high alert.  According to internet governance watchdog NetBlocks, there were significant disruptions to connectivity in multiple parts of Ukraine as Russia advanced.  ""We ask you to provide Ukraine with Starlink stations,"" said Federov referring to SpaceX's satellite internet service.  A few hours after Federov's tweet, Musk replied saying Starlink is now active in Ukraine, and that he was sending more terminals needed to use the service.  However, Musk did not specify how SpaceX was planning to get additional terminals to Ukraine. Locals will not be able to access the Starlink network without these terminals.  It's not the first time Musk's company has stepped up to help a country in need. Earlier this year, SpaceX reportedly sent some 50 Starlink terminals to be set up in Tonga in an effort to restore internet following a volcanic eruption.

42394286,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbDOV,1645977000,Forget Data – Privacy Is the New 'New Oil',"Data is oil, privacy is oil, too  Investors should care about individual privacy, if only because it’s becoming a trend that is already having an impact on the market.  To be sure, some of the most successful, profitable and impactful companies in the world have thrived thanks to a distinct lack of privacy. Those are companies like Google (now Alphabet) and Facebook (now Meta Platforms) that use the immense amount of consumer data available to them to cherry-pick advertisements to nudge you to buy something you don’t need but really, really want. That’s made possible by consumers giving up their privacy to provide that data.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  For a while, few consumers seemed to mind, and the market rewarded those companies. Facebook made its debut on Nasdaq with a $60 billion market capitalization in 2012, and then marched that figure up to more than $1 trillion by last August. Google had a similar trajectory, starting with a $23 billion market capitalization in 2004 and peaking just shy of $2 trillion late last year. They both did that by monetizing consumer data.  The Economist in 2017 said data was the most valuable resource in the world, over oil, harkening back to the data scientists’ rallying cry that “data is the new oil.” Now, however, consumers are beginning to mind that their information is getting pumped out of them. As a result, that data is getting harder to collect and use.  The paradigm is shifting toward more privacy.  No, mind your own business  My colleague (and favorite CoinDesk writer) David Z. Morris wrote a great piece about this shift for CoinDesk’s Privacy Week last month. In it, he gave us quotes like  “Your phone’s not listening to you,” Tsukuyama says. “But what’s scary is that [companies] don’t have to listen. They can infer who you’re hanging out with, time of day, if you’re looking for stuff, your age, all these kinds of things, from your search history. They don’t need to listen to you – they just know anyway.”  Enter Apple, which last year made a push to advertise improved privacy for its users. In short, Apple made it harder for apps to track data because users could choose to opt out. As an Android user who typically opts out of sharing data with apps, I regarded this as a nonevent. That was until Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook/Meta, said this on the company’s most recent earnings conference call:  “With Apple’s iOS changes and new regulation in Europe, there’s a clear trend where less data is available to deliver personalized ads… So we’re rebuilding a lot of our ads infrastructure so we can continue to grow and deliver high-quality personalized ads.”  That was on Feb. 2. Meta’s stock fell 26% on the next day. Apple’s push for privacy was so well received by its users that one of the most valuable companies in the world lost billions of dollars of market value.  Apple knows its users want privacy. Unlike Apple’s late founder Steve Jobs, Tim Cook, the current CEO, is a business school graduate who understands the value of market research (Jobs didn’t rely on market research because he believed customers didn’t know what they wanted until Apple told them). As Zuckerberg’s comments bring to light, the privacy pendulum is swinging away from “we’ll share everything” to “hey, we want our privacy back.”  So what does this have to do with crypto?  Privacy is something I’m obsessed with right now. And I’m taken aback by a lack of easy-to-use privacy in cryptocurrency, including bitcoin, even though privacy is one of the core tenets of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer digital cash.  Whether it’s Canada (where COVID-19 vaccine mandate protestors had bank accounts frozen), or it’s the alleged Bitfinex money launderers getting caught (even though they tried to cover their tracks), or even the potential doxxing of the Ethereum DAO hacker (even though he used a bitcoin mixer to obfuscate his trail), cryptocurrency is just not great for privacy, especially when it comes to converting crypto into cash for use in the “real world.”  From an investor’s perspective, there’s a meaningful conversation to be had about privacy-enabled technologies, because wherever there is sufficient demand, there is money to be made. We have seen this interest materialize, with equity raise volumes in privacy and cybersecurity companies hitting nearly $10 billion in 2019. With this renewed interest in privacy, we could expect more to come.  Whether that means investment needs to be made in Bitcoin infrastructure in order to enable a “circular bitcoin economy” (which would enable more privacy since off-ramps are arguably where privacy is compromised the most), or in the development of privacy crypto coins like Zcash or Monero, or in something else is up to the investor. Pick your spots.  TL;DR: Investors should care about privacy because consumers care about privacy.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | RESEARCH,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/27/forget-data-privacy-is-the-new-new-oil,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e354b2184adf0246ac6005628f5374c35a64dbf-3626x2479.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Putin cited ""aggressive statements"" from the North Atlantic Trade Organization (NATO) after the group issued a letter condemning Russia's ""full-scale"" invasion of Ukraine. The United Nations has confirmed 64 deaths among the hundreds of civilian casualties, though the number may be ""considerably higher,"" according to the Associated Press.  The Russian president also attributed economic sanctions for the significant upping of the stakes surrounding the conflict. On Saturday, leaders of the European Union agreed to block certain Russian banks from accessing the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), a messaging and settlement network that connects lenders around the world.  Maybe more importantly, at least the EU has vowed to paralyze Russia's central bank by blocking access to its foreign reserves. Russia currently has about $640 billion in reserves, with a sizable portion held in G7 banks.  A joint statement on the SWIFT decision, issued by the European Commission, U.S., U.K. and Canada, said the leaders of the western world ""stand with the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people in their heroic efforts to resist Russia's invasion.""  In addition to putting its nuclear arsenal on guard, Putin also threatened military action against neutral nations Sweden and Finland after they expressed a desire to join the 30-nation NATO over the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.  Meanwhile, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has agreed to meet for peace talks at the Belarus-Ukraine border without preconditions after initially rejecting talks in Belarus over concerns that the country was not neutral in the conflict.  Leaders of the European Union are set to meet on Sunday to begin work on implementing SWIFT sanctions on Russian banks.
