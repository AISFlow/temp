Bitcoiin2Gen and Start Options founder Kristijan Krstic and company promoter John DeMarr allegedly violated federal securities laws during the 2018 raise with DeMarr associate Robin Enos ""aiding and abetting,"" according to the SEC. DeMarr also faces criminal fraud charges in a parallel suit filed Monday.      The trio allegedly promised to deliver Bitcoiin2Gen's investors an Ethereum-based token the SEC claims never existed. They allegedly disseminated misleading brochures among 460 investors to whom they'd promised a ""mineable"" and ""tradeable"" digital token – B2G – selling the sham for funds they never returned.      Bitcoiin2Gen also banked on the blessing of actor Steven Seagal, whom Krstic and DeMarr (through a pseudonym) trotted out as a ""brand ambassador"" instead of a promoter earning $120,000 to pump B2G. Seagal, who was not named in the Monday suit, settled related charges last February.

42385847,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOdVT,1612215988,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Trading Tepidly at $33.7K While SushiSwap Eats Raw Market Share,"Bitcoin is taking a break, staying in a tight trading range with lower than average volume compared to the past month. Meanwhile, alternative cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance are stealing the spotlight.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $33,782 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 2.5% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $32,341-$34,715 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC above the 10-hour and the 50-hour moving average just slightly on the hourly chart, a sideways-to-bullish signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin is extending its weekend respite Monday, trading in a fairly tight $32,500-$34,500 range, although its 24-hour performance is up 2.5% as of press time.      “XRP – and DOGE interestingly – both jumped over the weekend while most of the majors, including BTC and ETH, floundered,” noted Andrew Tu, an executive at quantitative trading firm Efficient Frontier. “While the timing is hard to say, it is usually the case after a period of low volatility that the market breaks out in one direction or the other.”      Bitcoin spot trading volumes on major exchanges were at $2.6 billion Monday as of press time on the eight major venues tracked on the CoinDesk 20. That’s much lower than frenzied $4.8 billion average the past month, but well within earshot of the three-month average of $2.7 billion.      Lower volumes may explain some price sluggishness. Yet, given its 16% rise over the past month, Tu is skewing more bull than bear.      “The market seems to be leaning bullish, though a break to the downside again is always possible,” he said.      “January was a bumper month for bitcoin spot and futures volume, easily establishing new monthly all-time highs,” noted Jason Lau, chief operating officer of San Francisco-based exchange OKCoin. “For OKCoin, January spot volumes were more than two times December, which was already an all-time high,” Lau added “There’s clearly still a lot of interest in bitcoin as an asset, with the latest seeing Elon Musk expressing his support.”      Read More: ‘A Good Thing’: Elon Musk Says He’s a Supporter of Bitcoin      Lau told CoinDesk he is seeing a consolidation of bitcoin prices at current levels after the run-up to $42,000. He noted bitcoin’s dominance, a measure of the world’s oldest cryptocurrency market share in the ecosystem, continues to drop. Less than a month ago, on Jan. 3, bitcoin dominance peaked at over 73% and it has dropped roughly 10% since then.      “Alt and DeFi tokens are having their moment with bitcoin dominance down,” said Lau.    SushiSwap eating up DEX market share    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Monday, trading around $1,334 and climbing 2% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Decentralized Exchange Volumes Hit Record Above $50B in January      SushiSwap is making gains in trading volume market share for decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, hitting an all-time high of over 23% of the entire market as of press time, according to data aggregator Dune Analytics.      SushiSwap is a “fork” of reigning DEX by volume Uniswap, meaning that Uniswap's smart contract code was used to create the rival exchange. Peter Chan, head of trading for OneBit Quant, says both SushiSwap and Uniswap are benefiting from cryptocurrency price gyrations to better position themselves in the market. “They both experienced huge growth in volume lately, most due to increased market volatility,” Chan told CoinDesk.      In addition, Misha Alefirenko, co-founder of crypto market maker VelvetFormula, says the DEX exchanges’ token price gains recently enticed traders to switch from centralized exchanges (CEX) over to DEXs. “As we saw in the rally in altcoins, it is predictable that DEXs gain some market share from CEXs, especially in native DeFi tokens.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly green Monday. Notable winners as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):    orchid (OXT) + 18.8%  omg network (OMG) + 14.8%  cosmos (ATOM) + 14.4%    Notable losers:    xrp (XRP) - 11.5%  chainlink (LINK) - 0.25%    XRP, the native asset of San Francisco-based Ripple Labs, experienced a huge price run-up and subsequent precipitous fall Monday, making it the top loser on the CoinDesk 20 the past 24 hours.      “The XRP pump and dump may have been another situation where retail day traders brought the price upwards only to crash it,” noted Efficient Frontier’s Tu. “It seems like this sort of phenomenon is going to become more commonplace, especially in less-liquid markets like crypto, having been legitimized by the current zeitgeist.”      Read More: XRP Pump Fails to Materialize as Price Crashes 40% From Day’s High      Equities:    Asia’s Nikkei 225 index closed up 1.5% as investors hit the buy button amid positive corporate earnings results, particularly NEC jumping 12.8%.

Following nationwide protest rallies on Jan. 31, several people reported on social media they were detained by the police after subway and street surveillance cameras recognized them as protesters. Countries all over the world deploy facial recognition tech to surveil cities, leading to fears of possible abuse.      Over the past two weekends, Russians have been protesting the arrest of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who recently returned to Russia after recovering from being poisoned. Navalny built a nationwide political movement in Russia by exposing corruption among the country's high-ranking officials.      His latest investigation, released on YouTube after he was jailed, reveals a luxurious palace reportedly belonging to Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. (Putin denies he owned the property.)      The authorities have responded to the protests with mass arrests, beatings, criminal persecution of protesters and apparently some fresh surveillance methods.    Cameras at work    Popular photographer George Malets wrote on Facebook he was detained on Jan. 31 in the Moscow subway. Malets told CoinDesk that at the police station the police officers mentioned some “Face ID” system being used to search for people.      He added that he overheard people saying they were detained because they were spotted by street cameras at the previous protest rally on Jan. 23.      “According to what I heard from police officers talking to each other, there was a mass search yesterday,” Malets said. “Apparently, they were looking for anyone who was at least near the rally.”      The officers asked Malets about his presence at the rally, he wrote in his Facebook post, and were not convinced by his words that he went to the rally as a journalist to take photos. During the rally police detained journalists along with protesters, even though they were wearing green “Press” vests.      Lawyer Mikhail Biryukov posted yesterday his client Kamil Galeev, a historian, was detained at his home. According to the lawyer, street cameras captured Galeev during the protest rally on Jan. 23, and to identify him the police used photos from Galeev’s passport and social networks.      Rapper Samariddin Rajabov also tweeted yesterday that he was detained in the subway. Moscow subway stations have been recently equipped with video cameras, some of them placed on the entrance turnstiles.      The city authorities announced last year that those cameras would use facial recognition software to charge passengers for entrance and locate people “in need of medical assistance” for express help.

That’s helping to drive several of these exchanges' tokens to new highs.      Last week GameStop (GME) and and other stocks involved in a battle between a short-selling hedge fund and a Reddit group captured the imagination of the general public, a battle that drove these stocks' prices higher and squeezed the short seller.      Now, some of that buying excitement has spilled over to crypto where CEX and DEX trading volumes have risen over the past week, according to several crypto trading data sites.      Read More: After GME, Dogecoin and Bitcoin, Chinese Traders Are Betting What Will Pump Next    CEX volumes rise, taking tokens with them    Trading volumes for bitcoin futures on Binance and FTX surged over the weekend, according to data site Skew.      Binance’s BNB token hit a new all-time high at $50.27 during early U.S. trading hours on Monday, while FTX’s FTT token logged a record price of $12.95 on Friday, according to data from Messari.      “ATH [all-time highs] on a few different matrices” [for BNB], Changpeng Zhao, chief executive of Binance, tweeted earlier Monday.      Through a spokesperson, Zhao told CoinDesk that Binance’s utility token’s price rally is driven by its multiple use cases.      “[BNB’s] use cases have expanded to hundreds of applications on numerous platforms and projects within the crypto ecosystem [and] these are reflected in its growing price,” said the spokesperson, quoting Zhao. “...To become a true mass-adopted application, BNB must be able to facilitate billions of transactions per day. In its current form, we still have a long way to go.”      The traffic spike last weekend pushing BNB and FTT to the record highs likely resulted from increased trading traffic by retail traders coming from the traditional stock market, according John Todaro, director of institutional research at TradeBlock. (Cryptocurrency analytics firm TradeBlock is a subsidiary of CoinDesk.)      “The recent retail trading saga has shown that trading platforms, brokerages and even exchanges can shut down aspects of the trade process without much notice,” Todaro said. “This pushed some retail traders into cryptocurrency markets, as we saw with dogecoin, xrp, and stellar lumens catching a bid on the week.”      Read More: Crypto Long & Short: GameStop, Dogecoin and a New Market Paradigm      In an effort to capitalize on the retail trading frenzy caused by the GameStop stock drama, FTX last week listed a WallStreetBets (WSB) index quarterly futures contract, named for the Reddit group involved with the GameStop drama. The basket of stocks in the contract include GameStop plus Nokia (NOK), BlackBerry (BB), AMC Entertainment (AMC) plus the iShares Silver Trust (SLV) because of recent interest in silver.      Read More: FTX Exchange Lists WallStreetBets Futures to Capitalize on Investing Movement      “FTX lists tokenized equities, so investors could also be anticipating that Robinhood users and others may switch over to FTX to continue investing in stocks without the limits that various traditional brokerages have applied on their retail users,” Todaro added.      ""FTX has seen all-time high traffic this month (January) with an average daily volume over $5 billion and new records in daily users,"" Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of FTX told CoinDesk in an email response.    UniSwap and SushiSwap lead way for DEXs    Activity in decentralized finance (DeFi) is on the upswing. Total January trading volume on DEXs soared to an all-time high above $50 billion. On a seven-day basis, UniSwap and SushiSwap, the two leading DEXs, took 48.8% and 23.3%, respectively, of all DEX trading volumes, according to Dune Analytics’ DEX metrics tracker.      Read More: Decentralized Exchange Volumes Hit Record Above $50B in January      “Overall, the [crypto] market has had a lot of volume increased, both on CEX and DeFi,” Peter Chan, lead quant trader at Hong Kong-based OneBit Quant, told CoinDesk. He credits growing trade volume on SushiSwap for its SUSHI token’s price surge.      At the same time, Uniswap (UNI) and SushiSwap tokens exceeded their previous high prices, on Jan 31. and Feb. 1, respectively, according to data from Messari’s decentralized finance tracker.      Retail traders appear to be driving at least part of the price movement. The number of Google searches for “Uniswap,” the biggest decentralized exchange by market cap, is almost as high as during last year's ""DeFi summer"" boom. That is an indicator of retail demand for DEXs, according to TradeBlock’s weekly newsletter of Feb. 1. It also reflects some retail traders’ growing concerns regarding centralized trading platforms, with more people wanting to learn about decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap.      “Within DeFi, arguably the most ostensible applications in the sector are the DEXs [such as] Uniswap and SushiSwap,” Todaro said. “As the sector heats up, UNI and SUSHI have been the primary benefactors as they are the most visible.”      UPDATE (Feb. 2, 2021, 18:22 UTC): the article was updated with responses from FTX.",POSITIVE,BNB,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/01/exchange-tokens-hit-new-all-time-highs-as-stock-traders-rush-to-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7a86471e31e05cc7e529921ea1063090bcfaa106-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385837,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOdK9,1612209854,"FinCEN's Wallet Rule Aims to Close Crypto-Cash Reporting Gap, Official Says","Financial institutions report large cash and crypto transactions differently. This gap led to a controversial rule proposed by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) late last year, an official said Monday.      Speaking at a virtual panel hosted by compliance firm TRM Labs, FinCEN Deputy Director Michael Mosier was referring to a rule that would require crypto exchanges to report transactions involving private wallets (sometimes referred to as unhosted wallets) worth over $10,000 per day, as well as collect counterparty information for wallets that receive over $3,000 in crypto per day. The rule was proposed in the waning days of the Trump Administration by then-Secretary Steven Mnuchin.      If crypto is like cash, “why does the CTR, the currency transaction reporting requirement, apply to cash and banks and money services businesses but you have this gap with crypto,” Mosier asked.. “... There’s a concern at the senior government level, including political leaders here and abroad.”      The proposed rule, which was introduced on Dec. 18, 2020, would impose stringent data collection requirements on exchanges within the U.S.      While the CTR aspect is in line with requirements on cash transactions, the industry pushed back heavily against the counterparty information requirement, noting that among compliance burdens it would prevent U.S. crypto holders from sending funds to smart contract wallets, which by their nature don’t have names or addresses tied to them.    Mapping old laws to new tech    According to fellow panelist Jai Ramaswamy, the head of risk, compliance and regulatory policy at cLabs, one issue is that much of the U.S.’ financial regulations are centered around using intermediaries in financial transactions.      Ramaswamy is a former head of the U.S. Department of Justice’s money laundering section, and wrote an opinion piece on how unhosted wallet restrictions might backfire last year for industry organization Coin Center.      In Monday’s talk, he said the Bank Secrecy Act’s core regulation focuses on these intermediaries identifying malicious or illegal activity and reporting that to the federal government.      “When you move to a world where those financial intermediaries are no longer the gatekeepers, if you will, and individuals are transacting peer-to-peer, it raises concerns about ‘okay what do you do in a disintermediated world when the regulatory regime is focused on having those financial intermediaries play a pretty important and crucial role in managing the risk of bad money in the system,’” he said.      Read more: DC Magistrate Judge Calls Unhosted Wallet ‘Horror Story’ a ‘Fiction’      He later added that, in his view, it’s not clear whether the Bank Secrecy Act’s clauses can map well onto a system based on peer-to-peer transactions.      However, he said that “even criminals” would need to convert their crypto funds back to fiat to use them, hinting that regulations around these points of conversion may be sufficient to meet the law’s requirements.      “At some point in the value chain they need to get cash, to get currency because that is legal tender,” he said.    Future comments    Mosier said FinCEN staff realized the rule’s 15-day comment period was not going to cut it, that the public needed more time. The agency first added 15 more days. With the arrival of the Biden administration, FinCEN tacked on another 60.      The additional time gives industry members a window to more fully comb through – and critique – a rule proposal as complex as it is controversial. Many have already submitted detailed rebuttals that bemoaned the proposal’s original expedited comment period. Coin Center has even filed a second volley.      Read more: State of Crypto: Unpacking the Trump Presidency’s Crypto Legacy      Mosier said that finding the distinction between cash and crypto is a key target of the ongoing comment period. The comment period discussion can help FinCEN apply the old guardrails where applicable and develop new safeguards for new technology.      He also emphasized the proposed rule has multiple components, and encouraged responders to discuss the different aspects.      “It’s a proposal, it’s not all or nothing. Tell us about what works” and what doesn’t on the technical and conceptual front, Mosier said.      Comments that used practical and technical examples would be more helpful than just comments focused on conceptual issues, he said.    Staying ahead    The rulemaking process could also help FinCEN stay ahead of lawmakers who, Mosier said, might “overreact” to headline-grabbing incidents with a seemingly suspect cryptocurrency bent.      An example is the $500,000 in bitcoin payments made to far-right figures one month before the U.S. Capitol siege in Washington, D.C. That payment, which federal law enforcement agencies are investigating, has little to do with unhosted wallets but it plays into the same overarching angle that crypto can be used for crime.      “That’s the kind of low-probability, high-impact event that could cause lawmakers and others to overreact in terms of laws and regulations, and we want to be ahead of that,” Mosier said.

Rep.

42385844,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOdQR,1612203924,Robinhood Can't Democratize Finance Using Old Tools,"Despite its best efforts to the contrary, Robinhood did end up stealing from the rich and giving to the poor.      Melvin Capital, the $8 billion hedge fund that didn’t find GameStop (GME) funny, lost 53% of its portfolio in January ($7 billion) trying to short against the rallying cries of the Reddit Capitalist Union. Founder Gabe Plotkin also faces the embarrassment of having to get bailed out by his old boss.    Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Fintech Blueprint newsletter.    Speaking of, Steven A Cohen, New York Mets baseball team owner and former name-on-the-door of SAC Capital (known most recently for its insider trading fine of $1.8 billion), put $2.8 billion of capital into Melvin’s fund.      Ken Griffin, owner of the Citadel hedge fund (an investor in Melvin), and Citadel Securities (a massive market maker and buyer-of-order-flow for Robinhood), is seeing capital losses in the former and Washington, D.C., cries for scrutiny into market structure in regards to the latter.      Robinhood itself – which, for goodness sake, is not Wall Street but as Silicon Valley as it possibly gets – raised $1 billion immediately to protect itself from class-action lawsuits, DTCC capital calls and a now-rapidly closing IPO window. That means Yuri Milner of DST Global chipping in yet again.      That’s at least four people that have had a very bad, no good day.      The Reddit WallStreetBets army has eight million members. Robinhood has 13 million users. These are the opposing forces. They are, loosely speaking, having a pretty good day.    This isn’t about how much money you have. This is about a mindset and a framing of the world. It’s about who you are and who you are not.    But other billionaires are having way more fun. The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, is raising the crypto rallying flag and ex-Facebook billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya is trading along with Reddit for quick profits, decentralized hedge fund and all. This isn’t about how much money you have. This is about a mindset and a framing of the world. It’s about who you are and who you are not. And it’s about what you did and did not do.      Do you side with the internet’s gamer heroes, wearing Nyan cat shirts and crying out sarcastically for “moar Stonks, money printer go brrrr, number go up”! A post-Gawker-4chan swirl of human vectors, coalescing into one giant middle finger to every Karen and Ken? Dopamine splashing out from our pituitary glands into a vortex tornado of well-earned resentment.      Or, do you like your finance suited, ministerial, administrative and gated? Do you think it is storied, respectable and important. That you have to go to HYP and then do your “two and two” at Goldman and HBS before hopping to KKR or Tiger or SAC and then into your own cozy fund? All that work, all that sweat for the GMAT and the SAT and the bootlicking, to be undone by someone literally making fun of you in the language of money.      See also: Jill Carlson - GameStop and the Real Market Manipulators      It’s not about some truth about Wall Street or Silicon Valley or the internet or bitcoin or decentralized finance (DeFi) and least of all about GameStop (GME). Those are just flags of our armies. And we are at war with ourselves.      GameStop is a mall shop that sold video games. The mall shops that rented videos (Blockbuster) or sold books (Borders) are bankrupt and rightly dead. The internet, and its children Netflix and Amazon, killed them. And yet, their names are etched into the collective childhood memories of millions. GameStop has no chance against Steam or Epic – both brands that are also deeply loved by nerds all over the world. We say this as self-incrimination. And yet, GameStop is a symbol, a feeling, a reminiscence.      The person building financial models and analyzing this stuff according to economics is “right” to point out bad things about “fundamentals” of the business. Within the game of financial capital markets, the fundamentals are the gears of the economic machines that you evaluate with capital decisions. You buy good fundamentals, says Warren Buffett and you sell bad ones. Another Warren, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, also believes in fundamentals. She believes in them so much she wants the government to regulate them into the market and “fair, orderly and efficient function.”      All that might be right, and we are not doubting the wisdom of John Maynard Keynes or the animal spirits. But Warren Buffett is no longer number one. It’s an Elon Musk world now.      Fundamentals are what the financial doctors will tell you that you have. Do you think the internet cares about their diagnosis? No. The internet cares about being patronized by people in coats. Musk and Chamath are the mushrooms of the internet. It is in their DNA.      The GameStop trade itself is worth a pause. While some of the original thinking by DeepF**kingValue that led to his $30+ million capital gain reflected on the GameStop business, the core insight was market structure. The trade was not about GameStop beating its analyst estimates or any of that boring-play-by-the-rules stuff. It was about a short squeeze. It was about restricting the supply of the stock in such a way as to blow up a levered short bet that Melvin Capital was putting into play.      In other words, we are talking about the meta-game, not the grunt Excel spreadsheet game. SAC, Tiger, Point72, Melvin Capital and every other hedge fund worth its salt plays the meta-game. That’s the whole point. You get a PhD in financial instruments by doing the work and testing the levers rather than believing in them blindly. And WallStreetBets dared to play the meta-game as well. Retail investors aren’t supposed to self-organize into a hive-mind of levered derivatives strategy driven by spite. And here we are.      To go short, Melvin has to borrow. To borrow, you have to pay an interest rate. To cover your short, you have to buy back the stock. You’re paying an interest rate and have to buy back the stock. Nobody is selling you the stock, because they hate you. Everyone is buying, to troll you specifically. They are levering up with options. And you keep raising your bids until you cover your position.      Robinhood is a broker/dealer. It came into being in Silicon Valley, a place where consumer services are free because they are actually not services but honeypots that aggregate user demand, package it at large scale and re-sell attention to advertisers. Such is Facebook and Google. Our lives are better because of these services, but also compromised and profoundly insane.      Robinhood uses this playbook to aggregate consumer demand with the honeypot of free trading, and then sends it to market makers like Citadel Securities and gets paid $600 million for the orders. TD Ameritrade and eTrade and other discount brokers do this, too! But Robinhood does it most, and does it best. Check out our prior explanation with Paul Rowady here.      There is nothing unusually nefarious going on. It is just American capital markets structure and a clever lead-generation arbitrage. That is, if customers are still getting best-execution with Citadel. But the structure is ancient by modern technology standards, and far from real-time. It takes two days for a trade to settle, and this among other reasons leads to a requirement of capital to be placed with a “clearing house,” in this case the DTCC. Given the volatility in GameSpot caused by the internet trying to break a hedge fund the way George Soros broke the Bank of England, capital requirements skyrocketed tenfold.      Robinhood, as well as TD Ameritrade, ended up restricting trading in the instrument as a result of this capital call. If you are burning and raising a billion dollars per year, you probably don’t have a “tenfold” of cash lying around to give to the DTCC to make it feel comfy. So, you know, it just removed the “Buy” button for a whole bunch of crusaders on a mission with their capital on the line. They didn’t remove the “Sell” button, thereby throwing fire on the internet conspiracy meme machine.      Was this done on instruction from Citadel billionaires? Was this the banksters colluding against the common person? Was “Wall Street” trying to take away our constitutional freedom to trade on a mobile app? Even U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez found common ground in finding someone to blame!      It’s not a lot of rioters yet.      But remember, fintech – including Robinhood, Revolut, SoFi and the rest – is supposed to democratize access to financial services. That meant very little a decade ago, and ""dumb money” was disorganized and uninformed. Now, information is free and available to all. Equities trading is largely costless and frictionless. And the scariest part, for the suited part of finance anyway, is that strength lies in numbers and can now self-organize.      In addition to this, we have the crypto currency ecosystem. Unlike fintech, which went after distribution, blockchain goes after manufacturing. If you are a trader or market maker on Ethereum, there is no clearinghouse. There is no broker/dealer. There is only you and the distributed machine with its smart contracts, automated rule sets and software-enforced property rights. All data is real-time. The blocks click into being one after another without a single lawyerly piece of paper in sight. Hundreds of millions of people in the world have touched this asset class and it renders financial intermediaries unnecessary in their imagination.      See also: Jill Carlson - The GameStop Stop Is Not a Technology Problem      Now don’t get us wrong. A trade on Ethereum is going to cost you $10 to $100 today, and another 1% in slippage. It is going to cost you some immeasurable but ever-present probability of cyber risk and regulatory overhang. But you nobody can take away your “Buy” or “Sell” button, and the speed and scale issues are mere technical problems to be solved by the entrepreneurial gods.      Here’s the rub, post-fintech-crypto-democratization and all.      Humans are social animals. It is in our bones. The concept of fairness has been selected through the evolutionary filter and fueled a cooperation-based multi-billion person civilization.      Democracy is not oligarchy. Democracy means each person has one vote. If you were to vote according to assets under management, which is how finance has done it to date, you get very different outcomes than when you vote person by person. Now we have a set of promises and representation from companies like Robinhood that suggest a democratic empowerment of individuals to access the storied products of finance. Most people don’t know, or want to know, how the actual machine works. When the promises have a gap to reality, because of whatever reason, this creates kinetic energy for Twitter and Reddit.      It creates energy for people in the position of leverage who understand the machine, and want it to change. Elon Musk hates short-sellers for their damping, and perhaps manipulating, effect on his promises of Tesla greatness. Certainly Chamath, having launched endless SPACs to take Silicon Valley fintech distributors like SoFi public, understands the machine as well. For them, this tear in the fabric of reality is a power. It is a rallying cry.    Retail investors aren’t supposed to self-organize into a hive-mind of levered derivatives strategy driven by spite. And here we are.    If we really want to put this into dystopian context, let’s at least reference the theory of overcrowding elites from Peter Turchin. The historian eerily predicted the 2020 rioting and disaffection back in 2010, suggesting that societies fall apart when they over-produce members of the ruling class. Education has minted PhDs, MBAs and entrepreneurs who have no seat to inherit from a retiring predecessor. As a result, they take on the populist mantle and position themselves as outsiders to attack the insiders, while of course being fabulously gifted. Thus Donald Trump and all the rest.      If you are holding power today you probably don’t want everything to fall apart just because Redditors hate a caricatured notion of hedge funds. So you tweak things at the edges. Edit out the glitches in the current matrix. It is through this lens that we see Google deleting 100,000 negative Robinhood reviews for being “inauthentic.”      Of course they were coordinated. But they were very authentic to the people who wrote them. They were, however, “inauthentic” to the current rule-set of the game. Based on fundamentals, market structure and a variety of other “this is how things work” explanations, Robinhood did nothing wrong. Nor did Melvin, really, as far as we can tell from the media coverage. It just played a game that has become a cartoon that millions of people despise. Google’s app store is also an incumbent, a rule-set as well of what constitutes good behavior and what you should do according to its Terms, and so on. Protecting Robinhood’s reputation because it did not fundamentally err is what you do when you believe the current system works.      What’s also notable is that TD Ameritrade and other brokers that couldn’t support trading didn’t get such a backlash. The answer as to why is obvious. The brand promise of Robinhood is to bring in a new world, which it simply can’t do using old-world tools.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Lex Sokolin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/01/robinhood-cant-democratize-finance-using-old-tools,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/11f9b575faa9d45959b78056013df46f70cb7fe9-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385838,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOdGN,1612202298,"IBM Blockchain Is a Shell of Its Former Self After Revenue Misses, Job Cuts: Sources","IBM has cut its blockchain team down to almost nothing, according to four people familiar with the situation.      Job losses at IBM (NYSE: IBM) escalated as the company failed to meet its revenue targets for the once-fêted technology by 90% this year, according to one of the sources.      “IBM is doing a major reorganization,” said a source at a startup that has been interviewing former IBM blockchain staffers. “There is not really going to be a blockchain team any longer. Most of the blockchain people at IBM have left.”      IBM’s blockchain unit missed its revenue targets by a wide margin for two years in a row, said a second source. Expectations for enterprise blockchain were too high, they said, adding that IBM “didn’t really manage to execute, despite doing a lot of announcements.”      A spokesperson for IBM denied the claims.      “Our blockchain business is doing well, thank you,” Holli Haswell, a director of public relations at IBM, said via email. “We have realigned some leaders and business units to continue to drive growth – we do that every year.”      A former IBM staffer who had been working on enterprise blockchain, however, said there have been a succession of “Resource Actions,” or RAs, which basically means firing people based on business performance as opposed to personal performance.      “I would wager less than 10% [of the blockchain product and engineering team] is still working on IBM Blockchain,” said the ex-IBM source. “There have been tons of reorgs. Pretty much everyone is gone. IBM is now 100% focused on hybrid cloud, so everything that doesn’t support that is deprioritized.”      IBM has pumped a lot of money into blockchain since 2016, when it began talking about the technology’s potential to transform the way industries do business.      If IBM’s blockchain innovation work is now confined to some R&D, and does not even extend to consulting, as one of the sources said, this sounds an ominous note for the enterprise blockchain space in general – perhaps particularly for the Hyperledger collection of blockchains, to which IBM was a key contributor.      In its recent full-year results statement, IBM as a whole reported revenue fell 6% on an annualized basis. Looking back to its 2017 financial statement, IBM called itself the “blockchain leader for business.” All mention of the technology is now absent from the company’s statements.    No more TV commercials    In the past several years, IBM has pushed ahead with a series of blockchain networks built on Hyperledger Fabric. Big Blue’s major blockchain networks are FoodTrust, a farm-to-supermarket tracking system backed by Walmart; and TradeLens, a shipping container logistics blockchain backed by Maersk. IBM has also added the Trust Your Supplier network and previously had a go at payments via World Wire.      While cryptocurrencies and public blockchain networks appear to have flourished in 2020, the economic shock of COVID-19 has impacted innovation departments inside large firms, to the extent that areas not immediately generating revenue – such as blockchain – have been trimmed.      Another source, an enterprise blockchain engineer with former ties to IBM, estimated more than 100 blockchain-related jobs were cut at Big Blue over the last year.      The source also pointed out that Jerry Cuomo, IBM’s head of blockchain and an evangelist for the tech going back to 2016, has been moved and is now working on artificial intelligence.      “Jerry is indeed overseeing additional strategic, high-growth parts of the IBM business but is still involved in blockchain,” said Haswell, the company spokesperson. “He is a very senior technical leader and that is what we do in IBM – people’s roles expand.”      After publication of this article, Haswell further disputed the reporting, adding:    ""IBM maintains a strong team dedicated to blockchain across the company. We have shifted some resources but remain committed to the technology, blockchain ecosystem and services. We see blockchain as a driver for our cloud business.""

42385843,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOdRh,1612201881,Blockchain Bites: The 'Silver Lining' for Bitcoin,"Three stories    India’s Parliament is considering a bill that would ban “private,” non-sovereign currencies, including cryptocurrencies. This is the latest attack on the growing crypto industry in the country after a two-year ban was overturned by the country’s supreme court in March 2020, CoinDesk’s Tanzeel Akhtar reports.    The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2021 also looks to create a framework creating an official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The scope of the bill is still being debated, which leaves room for unspecified exceptions.  “This is (the) time to be nervous,” an official at a large cryptocurrency exchange said to the Economic Times of India on the condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, Nischal Shetty, CEO of Mumbai-based cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, warned, “Wrong or hasty regulations will set us [India] back by a decade. Right regulations will catapult India to the forefront of this technology.”  With a united Parliament, the bill has a good chance of becoming law, making India the first major Asian economy to ban private cryptocurrencies rather than regulating them like corporate stocks.    Switzerland now lets tokenized securities trade on a blockchain with the same legal standing as traditional assets. The law, which went into effect today, treats tokenized securities as a new asset class providing legal ownership rights to investors via a blockchain, CoinDesk journalist Ian Allison reports.    In a move that could have strategic significance for other jurisdictions, Switzerland’s legislators decided against creating a separate digital asset regulatory regime but instead grafted rules concerning distributed ledger technology onto the existing legal framework.  Switzerland’s two regulated crypto banks, Sygnum and SEBA, have pounced on the news by issuing tokenized securities. Sygnum tokenized a range of premium investible wines, while EBA is issuing its Series B equity shares as Ethereum ERC-20 tokens.  Separately, Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG was granted a securities house license by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), allowing the firm to deal in the emerging world of regulated security tokens.    Visa is exploring ways to make cryptocurrencies more “safe, useful and applicable.” In an earnings call, Visa CEO Al Kelly said the payments giant’s strategy “is to work with wallets and exchanges” to enable users to buy and cash out crypto “using their Visa credentials.”    “These wallet relationships represent the potential for more than 50 million Visa credentials,” Kelly said. He added that 35 of “the leading digital currency platforms and wallets” already work with Visa.  The payments executive said stablecoins could be fit for “global commerce” and that “digital currencies running on public blockchains as additional networks just like RTP or ACH networks,” though bitcoin has yet to be “used as a form of payment in a significant way at this point.”  At stake    Silver lining? Crowd-driven market dynamics that took the world by storm last week are still in play. After traders on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets drove shares of GameStop from $19 in December to $347 last Wednesday, squeezing the short position of a formerly high-flying hedge fund, some are saying the genie is out of the bottle: Small investors are empowered like never before. Their magic? Virality.      This morning, silver traded above $30 an ounce, after being promoted on Twitter and Reddit all weekend. Similar spikes occurred in crypto markets last week. Dogecoin went parabolic, briefly entering the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Perhaps this isn’t so surprising for a coin that’s little more than a meme, as world’s richest man Elon Musk said on Clubhouse last night.      Bitcoin also benefited from internet exuberance after Musk updated his Twitter bio to just #bitcoin on Friday. A surge to $38,000 wiped out $387 million worth of short positions, though the momentum didn't last long. Even comments from Musk last night that bitcoin is “a good thing” have failed to move the needle.      While it appears WallStreetBets has yet to rally behind bitcoin, despite repeated calls for hivemind price action to send it to the moon, XRP did. As CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported, the Buy & Hold XRP Telegram group, founded on Saturday, successfully orchestrated a classic pump and dump of the beleaguered cryptocurrency.      The crypto hit a two-month high, erasing much of the value lost after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed suit against Ripple Labs, which holds a significant chuck of XRP. (Ripple responded to SEC allegations on Friday, arguing “the functionality and liquidity of XRP are wholly incompatible with securities regulation.”)      But as of press time, XRP is down 40%, showing the limits of coordinated buying. It’s unknown why the price tanked, though “it’s quite possible that a whale (large investor) took advantage of the price rise and dumped his holdings,” Godbole noted.      Is it all bad? Well, as Bloomberg noted, at least part of the reason silver didn’t go higher was the trouble in sourcing and moving its physical stock. Overwhelmed dealers said they were unable to process orders due to unprecedented demand.      Clarifying his thoughts on bitcoin, famed investor Ray Dalio noted its strength as a gold-like ""storehold"" of value. Unlike other alternatives, bitcoin is easily transferred and can be privately held.      You could call that a silver lining for digital gold.

42405819,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeojlU,1612189834,Switzerland’s Tokenized Securities Law Ushers In New Chapter for Digital Assets,"Switzerland now lets tokenized securities trade on a blockchain with the same legal standing as traditional assets. The new law went into effect Monday.      Swiss lawmakers decided not to create a completely new regime but adapted legislation to graft specific features of distributed ledger technology (DLT) onto the existing legal framework. The DLT amendments recognize tokenized securities as a new class of asset, whose legal ownership rights are automatically transferred via the blockchain to each new investor.      “Previously, you had uncertificated rights there that had to be assigned, and a lot of smart people were looking at how that could be done on-chain,” said Alexander Vogel, a partner at Swiss law firm Meyerlustenberger Lachenal (MLL). “With these new registered rights, it's clear that you have legal certainty. If they are properly transferred on a blockchain, the new owner who holds them in his or her wallet is definitely the owner of these rights.”      The law change further cements Switzerland as one of the most advanced jurisdictions in the world for crypto (only Singapore is at a similar level). That said, it’s not going to be a free-for-all: Obtaining the necessary license from Swiss regulators takes time and effort.      Switzerland’s two regulated crypto banks, Sygnum and SEBA, chose to mark the occasion by issuing tokenized securities. Announced today, Sygnum tokenized a range of premium investible wines from Fine Wine Capital AG.    Read more: Fine Wines Become First Tokenized Securities Under New Swiss Blockchain Law    Meanwhile, SEBA is issuing its Series B equity shares as Ethereum ERC-20 tokens. The move will allow for ""seamless connectivity for trading and liquidity on future internationally recognized digital liquidity venues,"" the firm said in a press statement.      Speaking about the new legal wrapper for tokenized assets, Matthew Alexander, head of digital corporate finance and asset tokenization at SEBA Bank, said:    “It's a genuine blockchain-based digital twin of a traditional security. Switzerland’s strategy is to provide a bridge into this new digital economy and the transition from traditional fiat ways of banking and security assurance.”  SDX skates on    Alexander said any issuer in Switzerland could take advantage of the new laws. That includes Swiss banking major UBS, for example, which issues its primary securities on SIX, the country’s national stock exchange.      Presumably, the DLT law will fuel the fire under the SIX digital exchange, SDX, to get its services up and running and ready to cater to this emerging market.      “So SDX, the digital twin of the Swiss stock exchange, is still under construction and has been for a long time,” said SEBA’s Alexander. “But it will then host these digital twins and that whole transition is coming.”      Still, SDX could be missing a trick if it doesn’t get its skates on. Both Sygnum and SEBA have ties to Singapore and will operate as market makers on DBS Bank’s new digital exchange, which is now up and running.    Read more: Switzerland’s Crypto Broker AG Wins Securities House License From FINMA    MLL’s Vogel agreed Switzerland’s new DLT legal underpinnings would look attractive in Singapore too.      “It will definitely give more legal certainty,” Vogel said. “So even though it's traded in a foreign jurisdiction, you would still look at the underlying right for investors to have the confidence to invest in that asset.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/02/01/switzerlands-tokenized-securities-law-ushers-in-new-chapter-for-digital-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7b764bfb7f633d870b1326177863789cc5299fec-1800x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The cryptocurrency is trading near $0.42 at time of writing – down 40% from the high of $0.75 reached at around 11:10 UTC, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      A coordinated buying effort by some 200,000 members of the two-day-old Telegram group called ""Buy & Hold XRP"" at 08:30 a.m. ET was supposed to push the cryptocurrency to higher resistance levels. Instead, XRP pulled back from $0.75 to $0.60 ahead of the crowd buying and extended losses to $0.40 after 08:30 a.m. ET.      The cryptocurrency almost doubled in value over the weekend and clocked a two-month high earlier today. The price action suggests some traders bought XRP in anticipation of a price pump, inadvertently pushing it higher. Some of them may now be trapped on the wrong side of the market.      At press time, the exact reason for the price dump is not known. It's quite possible that a whale (large investor) took advantage of the price rise and dumped his holdings. Pump and dump strategies are not new to crypto markets, particularly for XRP.      A Reddit post, which talked about a crowd-buying attack at 08:30 and how it could be successful, has now been removed by Ripple moderators.

42405822,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeojmT,1612188357,First Mover: Silver Is the New GameStop as Musk's #Bitcoin Stalls,"Bitcoin (BTC) quickly settled back into the past couple weeks' range of between roughly $30,000 and $36,000 after a short-lived price spike Friday when Elon Musk, the electric-vehicle and private-spaceflight entrepreneur who's also reportedly the world's richest person, added ""#bitcoin"" to his Twitter profile.      ""The longer we stay at the current level, the stronger the base to bounce back up,"" Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the exchange firm EQUOS, wrote early Monday. Bitcoin prices finished January up 14% on the year.      Last week's Reddit-fueled trading in GameStop (GME) bore uncanny similarities to the fevered, anything-goes trading culture that has long defined cryptocurrencies. The five-fold jump in prices for dogecoin (DOGE) – a blockchain-based token representing little more than a doggie-faced meme – showed some of that retail-trader-driven mania spilling over into digital markets.      During an audio chat late Sunday on the app Clubhouse, Musk said he was a ""supporter"" of bitcoin and that it's ""on the verge of getting broad acceptance by conventional finance people."" He added that the ""most entertaining and ironic outcome"" would be if DOGE became the ""currency of earth in the future.""      Where will markets go next? The news of India's proposed crypto ban has made some bitcoin investors nervous, CoinDesk's Tanzeel Akhtar reported Saturday. Meanwhile, Chinese traders late last week were already speculating on which cryptocurrencies might be the next to get a major price pump, CoinDesk's Muyao Shen reported.      Prices for the digital token XRP (XRP) have nearly tripled in the past five days. They had fallen 67% in December, when U.S. securities regulators brought charges against Ripple Labs, which uses XRP in its payments network.      In traditional markets on Monday, stocks were higher in Europe and Asia, but the real action was in silver, where prices have climbed 16% over the past three days to about $30 an ounce amid a Reddit-fueled buying frenzy. Gold strengthened 0.9% to $1,860 an ounce.    Market Moves  The ""Grayscale premium"" is shrinking, and analysts are speculating why.    A growing number of cryptocurrency analysts are watching a steep contraction recently in a closely tracked ratio in the bitcoin market known as the ""Grayscale premium.""      This premium represents the difference in market prices for bitcoin and the price implied by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), one of the most popular vehicles for investing in the cryptocurrency via the stock market. (EDITOR'S NOTE: Grayscale Investments, which sponsors GBTC, is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)      What's getting attention now is that the Grayscale premium last week fell to as low as 3.5%, from upwards of 40% late last year, according to Ycharts.      Many observers say one explanation for the premium might be the lack of alternatives, especially when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve a bitcoin-focused exchange-traded fund in the U.S. When the premium is elevated, it's seen as a sign of just how eager retail stock traders are to bet on bitcoin's price.      So the recent decline might be explained by signs that greater competition is on the way: BlockFi, a major hub for crypto lending, has filed to start a new bitcoin trust, CoinDesk's Danny Nelson reported. According to The Block, Osprey Bitcoin Trust will list on over-the-counter markets in coming days. In Canada, the investment firm Ninepoint Partners completed an initial public offering of a cryptocurrency fund worth a reported C$230 million (US$180 million).      Yet, there may be another factor: Flagging demand for bitcoin with prices over $30,000, double their level just a couple months ago. Some institutional investors who were betting on the price to keep mooning may have lost their nerve, and the premium collapsed as they rushed to exit positions.      ""The dissipation of this premium is further evidence of the internal stresses of the markets on bitcoin,"" Greg Cipolaro, global head of research for NYDIG, a digital-asset investment firm, wrote Friday in a weekly report.      He noted that the gap has also compressed between spot prices for bitcoin and futures contracts traded on the Chicago-based CME – possibly another indication that traders are taking less market risk in the face of heightened volatility.    Bitcoin Watch  ""A BTC bull and believer""    The rally triggered by Tesla CEO Elon Musk adding ""#bitcoin"" to his Twitter profile quickly fizzled, but Su Zhu, CEO of the cryptocurrency investment firm Three Arrows Capital, says that ""long term, it's very bullish.""      ""Elon news is a watershed moment for crypto as the wealthiest man in the world and operator of the world's most successful companies is now a BTC bull and believer,"" Zhu told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.      Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based prime brokerage Bequant, expects range-bound trading to continue for a while. He points to healthy market signs, including growth in blockchain-based trading and lending systems of decentralized finance (DeFi). Flow into exchange-traded products remains strong, he said.      ""Everyone is looking for catalysts but I don't think any new catalysts per se are required,"" Vinokourov told CoinDesk.      - Omkar Godbole    Token Watch  CoinDesk 20 Returns in January    Stellar (XLM), the payments token, surged 143% in the first month of the year to dominate the CoinDesk 20 set of digital assets. Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, gained 77% on the month. Bitcoin rose 14%.    What's Hot  Crypto industry booms but doesn't quite ""Zoom,"" while Elon Musk gets immortalized on the Bitcoin blockchain.    One of the biggest questions facing the crypto industry over the past year has been whether the companies and their new-tech platforms could ""Zoom"" – where suddenly everyone starts using the product. Last week showed there's plenty of progress still to be made on that front. The industry groaned under the newfound attention from ready customers, some of them ostensibly fleeing the trading platform Robinhood following a series of anger-inducing trading suspensions. Outages were reported at crypto trading venues including Coinbase, Kraken, Binance and Voyager. New York Department of Financial Services Superintendent Linda Lacewell tweeted that, as the state's virtual-currency regulator, she was ""actively monitoring market volatility.""      Elon Musk's Twitter account got a hat tip in the form of a message encoded into the Bitcoin blockchain. The phrase, ""In retrospect, it was inevitable,"" was written by a clever bitcoin miner into the record for data block 668197, shortly after the world's richest man updated his profile to include the hashtag #bitcoin.    Analogs  The latest on the economy and traditional finance    The hedge fund Greylock is known for making bets on the government debt of troubled nations like Argentina, Lebanon and Venezuela. Now, according to Bloomberg, Greylock, led by CEO Hans Humes, has filed for bankruptcy protection, apparently seeking the court's help to wriggle out of its own liabilities. The proceedings reportedly will allow Greylock to terminate its $100,000-a-month office lease in Manhattan.

Last week, the financial world and beyond looked on as an army of ordinary online investors, the WSB group, took on the power of big institutions by pumping the price of U.S. video game retailer GameStop’s (GME) stock to counter Wall Street hedge funds that were “shorting” or betting against it.      In his post, Cuban praised the new generation of investors that have grown up in a digital world, stressing that everything that has been of greatest value to them has been digital.      “It’s pretty obvious that the WSB traders are applying the same principles of the digital/CryptoAsset world to the stock market and they are loving the fact that the old schoolers are hating it,"" Cuban wrote.

That is not the case,” writes Cuban.      He adds that Wall Street and the agency that regulates it, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), ""have become fat and happy"" and this makes the old school slow and resistant to change.

According to a press release on Monday, Sygnum Bank teamed up with Fine Wine Capital AG to tokenize a range of ""investible fine wines,"" issuing tokens representing the alcoholic assets on Sygnum's Desygnate platform.      The move was enabled by the first phase of the new law, effective as of Feb. 1, with Sygnum and Free Wine Capital now free to register and transfer their tokenized assets without concern for any legal ramifications, according to the release.      The legislation is expected to open luxury goods such as diamonds and fine wine to a larger pool of investors by increasing accessibility and liquidity of such assets using blockchain technology.      ""Tokenization of wine assets enables us to expand our private collector investor base to new private and institutional investors,"" said Fine Wine co-founder Alexandre Challand. ""This provides them the opportunity to hold, trade or request a physical settlement of this unique asset in an efficient manner.""      Tokenized assets issued on Desygnate have their ownership records recorded on the blockchain ledger that is legally binding. The ownership rights are transferable to others solely over the DLT system under Switzerland's new law.

Kraken announced Monday it is now running its own Chainlink node, enabling it to broadcast its Oracle Rates to Ethereum and other blockchains.  Chainlink’s built-in cryptographic signing capability also means users will have access to on-chain proof of any data originating from Kraken's platform.  The Oracle Rates can provide real-time price data feeds for decentralized applications, including derivatives contracts, lending, payments and stablecoins, San Francisco-based Kraken said.  Chainlink's decentralized oracle network is widely used within DeFi to provide reliable price data aimed to be free from manipulation. Oracles provide data that can be used to trigger events using smart contracts.  “Not only will this provide DeFi with accurate price feeds from a high-volume exchange, but we can cryptographically sign this data on-chain to prove without a doubt its origin, making it even more reliable when used to trigger automated blockchain transactions,” said Jeremy Welch, Kraken’s VP of product.

According to a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice on Friday, Hugo Mejia, 49, pleaded guilty to a two-count charge of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and money laundering.      From May 2018 to September 2020, Mejia operated a digital currency business that exchanged cryptocurrency for cash, taking commissions for transactions conducted on his platform.      Mejia failed to register his business with the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network – an agency within the Department of the Treasury that aims to safeguard against financial crime through data collection and analysis.      During the 28-month period, Mejia exchanged around $13 million and established other companies such as The HODL Group LLC and Worldwide Communications LLC to hide the true nature of his illegal activities.      His business was advertised online and via word of mouth while also communicating with potential clients via encrypted messaging services and meeting them inside coffee shops.      Mejia's undoing came by way of a sting operation in which a person working with law enforcement and posing as a client met with him in a coffee shop and agreed to buy 14.273 BTC for over $82,000, plus fees. Over the course of the sting operation, Mejia had conducted five bitcoin-to-cash transactions exceeding $250,000.      Since entering a guilty plea, the San Bernadino County man has given up all assets stemming from his illegal activity, including over $230,000 in cash, various cryptocurrencies and silver coins and bars.      Mejia is expected to go before a U.S. district court in March and faces a maximum statutory sentence of 25 years behind bars in federal prison.

The move more than reversed the late-December price slide triggered by legal troubles at the San Francisco-based payment protocol developer Ripple Labs, which has close ties to the digital asset.      XRP rose to a high of $0.6836 during European trading hours, its highest level since Nov. 25, extending the weekend's rally from $0.27 to $0.50, according to CoinDesk 20 data. As a result, the cryptocurrency has replaced the tether stablecoin as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market value.      XRP prices fell from $0.55 to $0.20 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced a lawsuit against Ripple Labs on Dec. 22, triggering a number of exchange delistings of the cryptocurrency. The regulator charged the company with violating securities laws by raising $1.3 billion over seven years from retail investors through its sales of XRP.      Ripple Labs pushed back against the SEC's allegations on Friday, arguing the functionality and liquidity of XRP are wholly incompatible with securities regulation, and its registration as a security would impair its main utility in faster, cheaper and more transparent global payments.      The cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid on Saturday, rising 56% to register its biggest single-day gain in three years, and has remained on the offensive ever since.      A coordinated effort by the members of the two-day-old Telegram group called ""Buy & Hold XRP"" alongside calls to buy XRP by the r/SatoshiStreetBets group seems to have helped push the cryptocurrency to multi-month highs. At press time, the Telegram pump group had 200,000 members.      However, some observers are of the opinion the Telegram traders may not be the sole drivers of the price rise. ""24H volume on XRP on Sunday was over $26 billion. Even if each of the groups' members dropped $5,000 on XRP, that equates to 2% of total daily volume. Let's be rational here – no Telegram group is pumping the 5th largest coin in the space,"" popular Twitter-based analyst Credible Crypto tweeted Sunday.      The cryptocurrency is trading near $0.66 at press time, representing a nearly 30% gain on the day.      ""XRP's next target is $0.80, which, if breached, would allow a rally to $1 and higher,"" Alex Melikhov, CEO and founder of cryptocurrency framework Equilibrium and the EOSDT stablecoin, told CoinDesk.      As Melikhov said, there are no resistance levels between $0.80 and $1.00.

Crypto Broker AG is part of a digital assets conglomerate that includes asset management and storage infrastructure services. The license means broadening the scope of its business and adding a rubber stamp when it comes to compliance, risk monitoring, liquidity reporting and so on, said Crypto Broker CEO Rupertus Rothenhaeuser.      “Some of our client banks have strict orders only to trade with regulated partners,” Rothenhaeuser said in an interview. “Now it’s just a case of calling them up to tick a box and they can start trading.”    Swiss momentum    Switzerland is probably the only place on the planet where regulations are actually keeping up with crypto infrastructure. That said, only a handful of crypto firms have been given FINMA’s blessing.
