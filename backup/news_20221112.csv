42388681,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRQK2N,1668297077,FTX Hack Sparks Revolution at Serum DEX as Solana Devs Plot Alameda's Ouster,"Sam Bankman-Fried once called Project Serum, an on-chain crypto exchange that he created, the “truly, fully trustless” backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) on the Solana blockchain. But trust in the fallen FTX chief’s once-mighty crypto liquidity engine has suddenly run dry.  On Saturday, DeFi protocols across the Solana ecosystem began unplugging from Serum for fear that they didn’t know who wielded control – a concern fueled by the late-Friday hack at FTX. The developers once associated with Serum have gone silent. Meanwhile, the protocol’s dependence on Bankman-Fried and his bankrupt companies Alameda and FTX loomed large.  The true power over Serum rested with FTX Group, which continues to hold the program update authority keys, people familiar with the matter said.  Spurred by this crisis, DeFi developers are now rushing to create a new version of Serum that they can govern without fear of interference – or influence – from FTX. Across Twitter, Telegram, Github and in private Discords, the Solana community is finding a way to salvage one of their blockchain’s key platforms for trading cryptocurrencies without a centralized exchange.  “The ecosystem is coming together to solve this problem right now,” said Ben Chow of the decentralized exchange aggregator Jupiter.  The FTX hack  Serum is a pillar of Solana’s DeFi infrastructure: it's the trading ecosystem's primary central limit order book, a more efficient alternative to the ""automated market maker"" setup popular on DeFi exchanges. With help from big market makers such as Jump and Alameda, it has processed over $32 billion in volume this year, according to data site Nomics. But that activity has fallen off a cliff; it's seen just $3.5 million in trades in the last 24 hours, an 80% drop from the day before.  Last night’s apparent hack of FTX has shattered projects’ confidence in the original Serum, three people familiar with the matter told CoinDesk. There’s of course Serum’s not-so-secret ties to Bankman-Fried. But only his employees have the keys that control the protocol, two developers said.  “The hack shows that someone malevolent has access to private keys at FTX,” said the pseudonymous Rooter, a developer on the lending protocol Solend that gets token price data from Serum. He is one of three DeFi developers who said they fear Serum’s keys could be compromised, too.  “That would allow the hacker to rug the entire protocol. At this point things have gotten so crazy that anything is on the table,” he said.  Lending protocol Solend, Jupiter, automated market maker Raydium, stablecoin swap shop Mercurial Finance and other Solana-based DeFi traders, as well as centralized entities including Phantom wallet, limited their exposure to Serum Saturday morning. They disconnected price data oracles, shut down token trading pools or ceased trading on its central limit order book.  Michael Morrell, an independent contributor to Serum who closely follows the protocol, said the likelihood that a malicious actor would compromise Serum’s codebase is low.  And yet fear rages on in the entire ecosystem. With key Mango Markets developer known as “Mango Max” leading the charge, some of Serum’s earliest contributors are now attempting to fork Serum and start it anew, sources said.  Not so decentralized exchange  Their actions seek to restore trust in a not quite so decentralized exchange.  Serum was nominally governed by the vote of a community of holders of the project’s SRM token. But apart from voting on token grants, Serum’s so-called decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) had little actual authority over the protocol, according to the pseudonymous Crypto Notte, a contributor to the Vyper protocol. Proposals to change how Serum operated would pass and go nowhere, he said.  The FTX-backed contributors that once focused on Serum haven't been heard from in months and stand-ins from Bonfida, which inherited development duties, haven’t lived up to the task, developers said. But Serum worked pretty well – that’s all it needed to do. One source called it “feature-complete.”  In the past few months, Serum DAO had become a money tree for other protocols to shake token grants from, multiple sources in Solana DeFi said. Projects wanting to integrate with Serum would first suss out their proposal’s viability with major SRM holders and then pitch the community forum. Proposals that made it to a vote would usually pass with the backing of a single whale: a wallet that started with “Cuie.” That wallet was controlled by Alameda, according to Morrell, the independent contributor.  Another former developer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a small cadre of Alameda employees collectively decided how the Serum wallet would vote. The Cuie wallet single-handedly approved proposals at least 13 times, a review of Serum's governance history shows.  “It’s a sham that survives on backroom deals,” said a source whose project once secured a token grant from Serum DAO.  The protocol’s rubber-stamp governance styles manifested in its press strategy. On Oct. 15, 2021, Project Serum's press team (also FTX's) pitched a CoinDesk reporter on the community’s approval of a $100 million budget allocation – before the vote had even begun.  FTX was heavily invested in the success of Serum. According to the Financial Times, Bankman-Fried’s exchange held $2.2 billion in SRM tokens as of earlier this week.  In digital asset markets, the SRM token slid 8.3% on Saturday. It's fallen 62% already just this month alone, leaving the price down 91% on the year.  Critical infrastructure  Despite its sluggish popularity and connections to Bankman-Fried, Serum isn’t the kind of project that Solana DeFi can walk away from and forget. Protocols that have been optimized for Serum still rely on it to function.  James Moreau, a key contributor at Jet protocol, said the project is nearly finished building a DeFi product that integrates with Serum.  “Trying to re-architect it for another platform makes no sense when it’s not even done,” he said. “I’d say we need to finish what we started and then assess the situation after.”  A spokesperson for the Solana Foundation told CoinDesk the organization was following developers’ effort to “contain risks around Serum.”  The lead figure in that effort, Mango Max, declined to comment.  Their campaign is working to “fork” Serum – basically recreate its codebase and start it anew, according to Chow, the co-founder of Jupiter DEX. Major ecosystem developers will share program update authority, he said.  The community's slapdash effort to wrest Serum from FTX Group skirts around a less heroic notion: few made much ado about the not so decentralized exchange's many entanglements before this week's dumpster fire began. Still, Saturday’s crisis could lead to a new Serum with a more credible claim to decentralization. That is a positive, according to Chow.  “Probably better in the long run as Serum was languishing anyway,” he said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/12/ftx-hack-spooks-solana-defi-community-igniting-revolution-at-alameda-controlled-serum-dex,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e81842d13f28a5733752f6596576bb6c7601e2ea-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

4131228,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3906677-crypto-enters-deleveraging-ftx?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1668269460,"Crypto enters new phase of deleveraging in wake of FTX collapse, analysts say","FTX's collapse, and resulting Chapter 11 filing, has taken a hefty toll on cryptocurrency assets in the past week, sending the price of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) down 21% and losing almost $82B in market cap since Nov. 6. J.P. Morgan strategists, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, said this new phase of crypto deleveraging, triggered by the collapse of FTX and its sister firm Alameda Research , is problematic because ""the number of entities with stronger balance sheets able to rescue those with low capital and high leverage is shrinking within the crypto ecosystem."" As a result of FTX's collapse, investors and regulators are likely to pressure crypto businesses to disclose more information about their balance sheets, to safeguard client assets, and to limit asset concentration. Meanwhile, crypto market participants are likely to adopt more diligent risk management, including managing counterparty risk, the J.P. Morgan strategists said. They expect it to take several weeks for the deleveraging cycle to peak, but the ""hit to crypto market cap is likely to be smaller than post-Terra given advanced deleveraging taken place before the Alameda/FTX collapse,"" Panigirtzoglou and colleagues said. Note that in May 2022, Terra coins ( LUNA-USD ) cratered in May as its sister token TerraUSD ( UST-USD ), an algorithmic stablecoin, lost its peg to the dollar. ""FTX’s bankruptcy will be a classic example of ‘short-term pain, long-term gain’,"" said GlobalData analyst Suneet Muru. ""It will deflate the crypto market cap over the next few months, but will force exchanges to realign their business models toward effective risk management."" The analyst also said exchanges must show that they're not the same as banks and need to keep far less of their own cryptocurrencies on their books. The price of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) could decline 25% from Nov. 9 (when the note was written; BTC price was ~$17.6K0), the J.P. Morgan strategists said. When looking at the potential downside, the bitcoin production cost has historically acted as a floor for the token's price. ""At the moment, this production cost stands at $15K but it is likely to revisit the $13K low seen over the summer months implying a decline of around 25% from here,"" they said. Morgan Stanley strategists Sheena Shah and Kinji Steimetz agreed that there's still too much leverage in the crypto ecosystem. ""We are in the midst of another deleveraging event in the crypto ecosystem and it is so far having limited spillover to broader equity markets beyond sentiment, as crypto institutions lent to each other,"" they wrote in a note to clients. They expect another round of crypto quantitative tightening, ""with creditor exposures revealed in coming weeks. These creditors are currently selling crypto assets to cover risks, adding to volatility,"" the Morgan Stanley strategists said. The bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) bear market that started more than a year ago has been the result of mostly institutions selling, Shah and Steimetz said. They expect that retail investors may start to sell if BTC trades below $10K. Morgan Stanley analysts assessed the impact on some related stocks that they cover: Analyst Mike Cyprys wrote that FTX's troubles could bode well for established incumbent exchanges like Nasdaq ( NASDAQ: NDAQ ) and CBOE Global ( BATS: CBOE ) that are ""entering the digital asset ecosystem and bring with them decades of experience in operating market places and risk management."" Robinhood Markets ( NASDAQ: HOOD ) is likely to see increased trading via its app in the near-term as the crypto volatility boosts volume. ""But once volatility subsides, we can see a more challenging market backdrop that weighs on HOOD's crypto transaction revenues,"" Cyprys said. For Silvergate Capital ( NYSE: SI ), analyst Manan Gosalia sees direct and indirect outflows as the primary concern, ""which would impact both margins and net interest income, as Silvergate's main source of revenue is the spread income on deposits held by their customers."" Digital asset exchanges account for ~64% of SI's total deposits as of Q3 2022, he said. And according to the company's latest 10-K, its 10 biggest depositors accounted for ~45% of total deposits. Gosalia said it's likely that FTX is included in that share. Analyst Mia Nagasaka expects that FTX has little direct impact on Monex Group ( OTCPK:MNXBF ) fundamentals. However, ""the key point for Monex is that if global major such as Binance expand their presence in Japan, we see risks of fee compression outside of the U.S., we we would like to monitor developments closely.""

42414951,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBVCDk,1668261600,"For Coinbase, FTX’s Bankruptcy Has Its Pluses and Minuses","Trading volume on Coinbase plunged roughly 75% in the hours following FTX’s bankruptcy announcement early Friday, according to data from Nomics, a sign the company is beginning to feel the pain from crypto investors shrinking from the increasingly volatile cryptocurrency market.  FTX’s Chapter 11 filing is the latest in a wave of high-profile exchange bankruptcies that have sent the crypto industry into freefall and prompted investors to reevaluate whether to trade cryptocurrencies at all, said Dan Dolev, a senior analyst at Mizuho.  ""For many investors, if you didn't read the writing on the wall for the last two events in this industry, it's basically that there's no bottom… this is [ investors'] last and final wake up call,” said Dolev.  It’s a reckoning that could hurt Coinbase’s bottom line.  Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S. by trading volume, reaps 90% of its revenue from the sizable transaction fees it charges its user base of mostly newer investors who don’t trade frequently, a revenue model that requires the company to continually replenish its user base.  But as FTX’s implosion batters investor confidence in the digital asset industry, onboarding new users may prove a difficult task. That’s a challenge the exchange will have to overcome to take advantage of its increasingly narrow field of competitors, one of the few silver linings of the bear-market crypto shakeout.  A different kind of exchange  Coinbase has cultivated a reputation as a safer alternative to fast-and-loose Binance and FTX, a reputation by its going public in 2017.  It’s a point of comparison the company has harped on as it reassures investors that it remains largely insulated from FTX’s implosion.  “I think it's important to reinforce what differentiates Coinbase in a moment like this,” wrote Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong in a Tuesday Twitter thread. “Coinbase has always strived to be the most trusted player in the space, and we don't engage in this type of risky activity.”  But the company’s decision to market itself primarily towards new traders and the crypto-curious may hamper its ability to grow as the market meltdown spooks less experienced traders and short-term crypto holders, says Lisa Ellis, Senior Equity Analyst at MoffettNathanson LLC.  “When prices are low and you're in a crypto winter, a lot of those retail investors kind of go into hibernation,” said Ellis.  Many new traders flocked to platforms like Coinbase during the pandemic, when inflation was low and government spending was high. At that time, investors’ rush to embrace digital assets catapulted crypto token prices to new highs too. In November 2021, bitcoin’s price peaked at just over $69,000.  But the ongoing crypto winter and then FTX’s implosion earlier this week has sent prices spiraling, meaning many Coinbase users will be less likely to trade. On Wednesday, following news that Binance had pulled out its deal to rescue FTX, bitcoin dipped below $16,000 for the first time in two years.  But there is a silver lining, according to Chris Brendler, an analyst at D.A. Davidson Company. Coinbase’s status as a public company may help the firm win over some new customers as FTX users who were blindsided by that firm’s sudden collapse come to embrace Coinbase, which is legally required to submit itself to rigorous audits and publish reports on its financial health.  “I would not be surprised if Coinbase picks up market share here,” said Brendler.

Just a couple of hours after the apparent hack began late Friday night, Musk tweeted “FTX meltdown/ransack being tracked in real-time on Twitter.” He also responded to a post by crypto entrepreneur Sam Altman with a raunchy meme of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.  Around 2:30 am EST on Saturday morning, Musk joined a Twitter Space with over 60,000 listeners to discuss the hack of FTX and share his thoughts on Bankman-Fried.  “To be honest, I’d never heard of him,” Musk said. “But then I got a ton of people telling me [that] he’s got, you know, huge amounts of money that he wants to invest in the Twitter deal. And I talked to him for about half an hour. And I know my bulls**t meter was redlining. It was like, this dude is bulls**t – that was my impression.”  “Then I was like, man, everyone including major investment banks – everyone was talking about him like he’s walking on water and has a zillion dollars. And that [was] not my impression…that dude is just – there’s something wrong, and he does not have capital, and he will not come through. That was my prediction,” Musk added.  Musk also told listeners that they should keep their crypto in cold wallets, not in exchanges.  “I would reaffirm that, if you have crypto, you should have it in a directly-accessible cold wallet. Not in an exchange,” Musk said. “That would be wise.”  The spectacular collapse of FTX – until this week one of the largest and seemingly most regulated exchanges in the world – hasn’t turned Musk off crypto as a whole.  “I think there probably is a future for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DOGE.

42414936,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBVB1S,1668236912,Crypto Fund Galois Capital Has Half of Its Capital Trapped on FTX,"Crypto hedge fund Galois Capital told CoinDesk in a Telegram message on Saturday that around half of its funds are stuck on FTX, the beleaguered crypto exchange which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday.  The funds locked in FTX total around $40 million, Galois co-founder Kevin Zhou said.  Galois earned acclaim earlier this year for predicting the crash of Terra, the stablecoin ecosystem whose $60 billion collapse was one of the key reasons behind crypto's plunge into its present bear market.  Depending on how the bankruptcy proceedings progress, it may take a while for Galois – or any FTX investors – to retrieve any of their funds.  In a letter to Galois investors, Zhou wrote that it could take “a few years” for the firm to recover “some percentage” of its funds. “We will work tirelessly to maximize our chances of recovering stuck capital by any means,” he told investors.  FTX was, until recently, the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, and managed to earn a high degree of trust from sophisticated investors and institutional clients relative to other platforms.  Things started to go sour for FTX when leaked documents uncovered by CoinDesk showed that the firm’s sister company, Alameda Research, was collateralizing loans with illiquid tokens – including FTX’s own FTT token.  Eventually, a bank run ensued, revealing that FTX was not backing user funds 1:1 behind the scenes – meaning the firm could not honor withdrawal requests without billions in rescue capital.  Now, according to Zhou, Galois is considering whether it should continue operating as normal, pursue an acquisition or become a proprietary trading shop.",NEGATIVE,FTT,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING | FTT,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/12/crypto-fund-galois-capital-has-half-of-its-capital-trapped-on-ftx,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7a5b3304cdf99948736c00e3dea8684d68653639-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Soon after, FTX stated in its official Telegram channel that it had been compromised, instructing users not to install any new upgrades and to delete all FTX apps.  ""FTX has been hacked.

FTX’s API appeared to be down, which could account for this. According to on-chain data, various Ethereum tokens as well as Solana and Binance Smart Chain tokens exited FTX's official wallets and moved to decentralized exchanges like 1inch.

The transfers occurred on the same day that the firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. after apparently losing – or misappropriating – billions of dollars in user funds.

Mere hours after FTX filed for bankruptcy, the Miami HEAT and Miami-Dade County issued a joint statement announcing they were cutting ties with the now-disgraced Bahamas-based crypto exchange – effective immediately.  Photos circulating on social media already purport to show FTX’s logo being dismantled from the top of the arena. The 19-year contract cost FTX a whopping $135 million.  “The reports about FTX and its affiliates are extremely disappointing. Miami-Dade County and the Miami HEAT are immediately taking action to terminate our business relationships with FTX, and we will be working together to find a new naming rights partner for the arena,” a press statement issued Friday reads.  Once one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, FTX was brought to its knees this week after a liquidity crisis triggered a domino effect resulting in the entire portfolio of companies, including the exchange’s U.S. subsidiary, FTX US, and Alameda Research, its quant trading firm, declaring bankruptcy. The entire portfolio of companies are now reportedly between $10-50 billion in the red.  The collapse of FTX has already triggered a ripple effect of consequences across the crypto industry and beyond – including in the city of Miami. Under the leadership of crypto-friendly Mayor Francis Suarez, Miami has attempted to establish itself as a crypto hub, welcoming crypto businesses, including FTX, to set up shop in Florida.  In September, FTX announced that it would be moving its U.S. headquarters from Chicago to Miami, and advertised its sleek new office space on Twitter.
