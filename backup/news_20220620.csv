Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin holds above $20,000; other cryptos are mixed.  Insights: China's CNH token looks promising as an alternative to dollar-based stablecoins, but the challenges to expanding its use are formidable.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $20,400, roughly flat over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin had surged on Sunday after a pause in the ongoing flood of bad economic, geopolitical and industry news that has plagued all digital assets, although markets remain unsettled.  ""Bitcoin is still being whipped by winds of worry as the investors flee the crypto world in their race away from risky assets,"" wrote Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst for financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown.  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was down about 2%, changing hands just above the $1,100 position it reclaimed late Sunday. Other major altcoins were mixed with FTT up over 9% at one point, but XLM and XRP slightly down. DOGE rose earlier in the day after Tesla founder Elon Musk tweeted that he would ""Keep supporting Dogecoin,"" but was in the red by the afternoon.  Equity markets were closed and crypto trading was light as the U.S. celebrated the Juneteenth holiday. Major stock indexes elsewhere were mixed with Japan's Nikkei down a few fractions of a percentage point, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng up slightly after China left its one- and five-year lending rates intact. Europe's Stoxx 600 rose .9%, despite a report that German producer prices rose 33% last month.  Investors remain worried about inflation, geopolitical turmoil and the prospect of a global recession. Brent crude oil, a measure of energy markets whose price has risen sharply since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, is trading at $114 per barrel, up over 46% since the start of the year.  Cryptos received a sliver of good news when the CEO of Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange Hoo.com tweeted early Monday that his company will open withdrawals for some tokens after announcing on Sunday in a blog post that it would be delaying withdrawals for 24 to 72 hours. Still the mood about crypto was downbeat.  ""The HODLer mentality is really being put to the test and those that haven't bailed yet may be as tempted as they've ever been,"" Craig Erlam, senior market analyst for foreign exchange broker Oanda, wrote in an email.  Hargreaves Lansdown's Streeter noted that although cryptos have suffered from ""extreme volatility in the past, the indications are that this decline may not be reversed any time soon and that a crypto winter could be settling in.""  Markets  (Friday, June 17 close)  S&P 500: 3,674 +0.2%  DJIA: 29,888 -0.1%  Nasdaq: 10,798 +1.4%  Gold: $1,838 0% (Monday, June 20)  Insights  The Challenges of Expanding the Use of the CNH Currency Are Formidable  The best thing for U.S. dollar dominance has been the emergence of crypto, specifically stablecoins. The $156 billion stablecoin sector is almost entirely dollar-denominated. As stablecoins become an instrument of international trade, all this has done is reinforce dollar hegemony over a new part of the global economy.  Beijing is perpetually annoyed by the dollar dominance of the global economy as this means U.S rules reign supreme. A recent episode with Huawei, exports to Iran and a dollar-denominated loan come to mind.  But can a solution be found in a stablecoin based on the CNH, a version of China’s currency designed exclusively for offshore use? While theoretically intriguing, widening the use of CNH would be difficult.  Capital controls and stablecoins  Given China’s country’s capital controls, where only $50,000 in foreign currency can be bought per entity, there’s demand for tether (USDT) and USDC from anyone that needs to send a significant amount of capital outside the country.  Despite the difficulty capital controls create for international business in China, it’s still a pillar of the People’s Bank of China’s (PBoC) fiscal policy because of the stability it creates for the yuan. A currency that’s not freely convertible is more stable because it's not exposed to the same market forces as freely convertible currencies like the U.S. dollar, euro, Canadian dollar or Japanese yen.  But this means that despite China’s status as the world’s second-largest economy, and arguably the most important, the yuan’s global share isn’t proportional to this status. Given that it can’t be used offshore, the yuan only accounts for around 2% of global payments.  At the same time, Beijing wanted a way to access foreign capital while maintaining the capital controls on the yuan. So in 2010, it launched the CNH, an ""offshore"" version of the Chinese yuan initially offered in Hong Kong but later in Singapore and Luxembourg, to spearhead the ""Dim Sum"" bond market – yuan-denominated bonds issued by domestic Chinese firms that are designed to exist outside China’s capital controls to attract international capital.  Remember that the CNH isn’t a real currency; there's not really a use for it outside buying and trading ""dim sum"" bonds.  Making a stablecoin from this currency, as CNH coin proposes, is going to be difficult. The entire market cap of the dim sum bond market, the primary use case for CNH, has a market cap of just over $80 billion which is around the same size as USDT at its peak.  In the end, there might not be enough CNH in issuance to create a stablecoin that’s a serious challenger. This isn’t a problem unique to the CNH, as attempts to create a stablecoin from the Singapore dollar have also run into the wall of supply.

These dips had driven decentralized finance (DeF)/ lending protocol Celsius, to the brink of liquidation. However, as the price has recovered, the platform is once again able to hold out for longer as its liquidation point is now a bit further away. The question remains if the recovery will hold and if Celsius will be able to avoid liquidation. Liquidation Price Pushed Back With the price of bitcoin above $20,000, the liquidation price of Celsius is now a little bit distant. This has not changed the sentiment around the lending protocol though, which has now suspended withdrawals for 7 days at this point. Its liquidation price still remains firmly at $14,000 but the company has assured the community that it continues to work to rectify the issues. Celsius had first announced the transfer and withdrawal freeze last Monday citing unstable market conditions as the reason behind the move. Even with the recent recovery, the lending protocol remains at risk of liquidation, and as such withdrawals and transfers remain frozen.

As prices recover, the next critical liquidation level is at $70. A close above this mark may see the coin pump to the early May 2022 price range. Past Performance of AAVE From the daily chart, the coin appears to be bottoming up, building on June 19 gains, a relief for optimistic traders. AAVE crypto prices are printing higher at spot rates, adding 21 percent against the USDT. The token is also up 13 percent during this period versus the BTC and ETH. AAVE Technical Analysis Buyers are back in the equation following an 82 percent dump from April 2022 highs. Even though the AAVE token is within a bear breakout formation and below the $70 reaction level, buyers are confident. There are chances that the current bounce could be a dead cat bounce. However, aggressive traders may load the dips with targets at $70. Further gains may see the coin race above the middle BB and $120. Conversely, losses below $45, last week&apos;s low, may dash bulls&apos; hope, paving the way for sellers to print new 2022 lows. What to Expect from AAVE? The recovery from last week&apos;s lows is with decent volumes, suggesting high participation levels and, thus, confidence. The $45 level may anchor the next leg up. However, this is mainly dependent on the reaction at $70.The post AAVE Technical Analysis: Is the Bear Run Over? appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform.",POSITIVE,AAVE | BTC,AAVE | BTC | ICO | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/aave-technical-analysis-is-the-bear-run-over/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=aave-technical-analysis-is-the-bear-run-over,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

Most people think that it is a scam. They do not know that transactions on cryptocurrencies are registered on the blockchain. This is unlike what is obtainable with networking groups where data are available on the platforms and can be wiped out. With peer-to-peer transactions, a user ensures that the transaction has been completed before the centralized exchange will release the fund, thereby, bolstering cryptocurrency adoption.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holder SOPR Continues To Trend Down As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, BTC long-term holders are currently realizing the largest amount of losses since 2019. The &apos;spent output profit ratio&apos; (or SOPR in brief) is an indicator that tells us whether Bitcoin investors are selling at a profit or at a loss right now. The metric works by checking through the transaction history of each coin being sold to see what price it was moved at before. If the last selling price of any coin was more than the current one, then that particular coin realized some amount of loss. While if the previous value was less than the one now, then the coin naturally moved at a profit. When the value of the SOPR is greater than one, it means the investors as a whole are selling at a profit right now.

Gold tokenized NFTs and stablecoins carry the corresponding value in underlying gold assets stored in a vault in the real world. However, there are fundamental differences between the two classes of crypto assets. The following are notable disparities: The Creation of Gold Tokenized NFTs and Stablecoins The main difference between the two crypto entities is how they become part of the blockchain. NFTs depend on the creative process of a creator who designs unique features of a project that includes either art, audio-visual content, or popular text. The owner mints NFT by converting the new project into digital form to make it equally valuable on an NFT marketplace such as OPenSea. The asset then changes hands from one owner&apos;s wallet to another depending on how tradable it proves to be on the blockchain. Stablecoins acquisition occurs through purchase over centralized or decentralized exchange (DEX) systems that support different coins. Gold-backed stablecoins such as Tether Gold (AUXT) have a hedge against unpredictable price shifts of normal cryptocurrencies. The hedge comes from the coins being gold derivatives whose blockchain market behavior simulates the physical asset&apos;s price movements.

Travel Ban Put on Terra&apos;s Key Designers According to a report from South Korean media outlet JBTC published today, the Seoul Southern District Prosecutor Office&apos;s Joint Financial and Securities Crime Investigation Team has imposed a departure ban on Terra&apos;s key designers as part of their investigation. The travel ban is effected to prevent these officials from fleeing the country like Do Kwon did. As of yet, it is unknown whether the designer in question was planning to escape the country before the order was issued. During an interview with JBTC, the designer said he had been in contact with Do Kwon who allegedly told him that he had &apos;made enough money to buy an island.&apos; The designer also told the media outlet that Kwon secretly sold the cryptocurrency to institutions so he could raise large amounts of money. As part of the investigation, the prosecutors are interested in whether the funds that were raised in this way were used to raise the coin&apos;s price artificially. While the Terra designer remains in the country, prosecutors could raise the possibility of launching a forced investigation which would include search and seizure orders, as well as summoning the key officers.The post South Korea Bans Terra&apos;s Main Designer...",NEGATIVE,LUNA,ASIA | ICO | LUNA | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/south-korea-bans-terras-main-designers-from-leaving-the-country/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=south-korea-bans-terras-main-designers-from-leaving-the-country,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

In its Sunday post, Hoo.com cited market volatility and liquidations by large institutions in the crypto industry as creating panic among users and leading to a large number of withdrawal requests.  “Meanwhile, the transfer of backup multi-signature wallet and other assets needs time to deal with,” Hoo.com wrote. “In order to process a large number of users’ withdrawal assets, the withdrawal audit time may be delayed for 24-72 hours, after which the withdrawal will be resumed soon.”  Hoo’s update comes as global crypto platforms deal with withdrawal requests amid market volatility and uncertainty around crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which suffered heavy losses and is exploring options such as asset sales or a bailout by another firm.  On Thursday, Hong-Kong based crypto staking and yield generation platform Finblox imposed a $1,500 monthly withdrawal limit and paused rewards in light of uncertainty surrounding Three Arrows, which made a $3.6 million investment in Finblox in December.  Finblox said early Monday it is “actively pursuing all available options (including legal recourse) to address the liquidity situation that has arisen due to the recent developments around Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and the market in general.”  Finblox said it's in the process of consolidating all users’ funds to evaluate the impacts of the current environment. The company is “investigating and assessing a range of possible scenarios and the potential effects that these scenarios could have on the liquidity of our Users’ accounts.” This includes operations and withdrawal time resumptions.  Meanwhile, Hong Kong-based crypto lender Babel Finance on Friday suspended withdrawals and redemptions, citing “unusual liquidity pressures.”  On Monday, however, Babel said it had reached preliminary agreements with counterparties on the repayment of some debts that led to the halt on withdrawals.

42423089,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2Mh1h,1655742151,UK Government Backtracks on Unhosted Wallet Data Collection Proposal,"The U.K government will not implement its proposed version of a controversial rule requiring all senders of funds to private crypto wallets to collect identification details of recipients, a document published by the Treasury said.  Based on the feedback received, the Treasury does not think it would make sense to create a data collection rule for unhosted, or private, wallets, it said.  ""Instead of requiring the collection of beneficiary and originator information for all unhosted wallet transfers, cryptoasset businesses will only be expected to collect this information for transactions identified as posing an elevated risk of illicit finance,"" according to the document.  Under Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards to prevent money laundering and terror funding, the originator and recipient of funds being transferred need to be identified. In the consultation document published last July, the Treasury said the rule should be applied consistently across the financial services industry, “regardless of the technology being used to facilitate transfers.”  In the July document, the Treasury said: “Cryptoasset firms will need to put in place systems for ensuring that personal information of the originator and beneficiary of a cryptoasset transfer is transmitted and received alongside the transfer, in an appropriate format.”  Had it been implemented as proposed, the rule would have required the sender of any transaction between unhosted wallets to collect know-your-customer data from the receiver. A similar proposal in the U.S. received backlash due to concerns about whether it would even be possible for some entities, like smart contracts with their own wallets, to comply, as well as whether the data would be safe if any random individual had to store it.  The U.K. government still wants to ensure some form of compliance with the FATF's travel rule, which recommends some amount of data collection to prevent money laundering.",POSITIVE,없음,REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/20/uk-government-backtracks-on-unhosted-wallet-data-collection-proposal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c68397b970b79cded650fd99218376183944c85-1000x662.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Arthur Hayes Expecting More Forced Selling Referencing a popular quote from Warren Buffet, Hayes suggested that the market is trying to figure out who is swimming naked. Buffett&apos;s explanation of that quote is that the outgoing tide usually exposes the risks and vulnerabilities of certain firms. This is particularly applicable to the current crypto market situation where leading players like Celsius and Three Arrows Capital (3AC) are displaying huge signs of weaknesses. If this trend continues, many other top industry players will likely follow the steps of celsius and 3AC. As noted by Hayes, Canada&apos;s Purpose Bitcoin ETF liquidated 24,500 BTC on Friday, which represented roughly half of its total holdings. The fund had about 43,701 BTC as of June 1, 2022. Hayes added that that&apos;s a lot of physical BTC to sell within a short period. 1/ BTCC - Purpose ETF puked 24,500 $BTC into the North American Friday close.

The ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy (BITI), which is designed to deliver the inverse of bitcoin's performance, will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Tuesday, ProShares announced Monday.  The ETF will allow investors to hedge their bitcoin exposure, which may prove particularly pertinent given the sharp downturn in crypto markets of late.  ProShares was the first firm to list a bitcoin futures ETF in October, a factor which saw the world's largest crypto hit an all-time high of around $68,900 in the subsequent weeks. Bitcoin investors will be hoping the listing of a short bitcoin futures ETF does not have a similar effect on the world's largest crypto in reverse.  Bitcoin's price dropped below $20,000 for the first time since Dec. 20 on June 18, falling as low as $17,800 the following day.  ProShares applied to list BITI in early April, around the same time as leveraged ETF-provider Direxion filed to list a similar product. As yet there have been no updates on the status of Direxion's application.  A short bitcoin ETF is also already listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange by Horizons ETFs.

42374440,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZVfl,1655735449,"Solana, Ether Lead Gains in Relief Rally, but Traders Say Macroeconomic Concerns Remain","Crypto markets saw a brief rally in the past 24 hours, adding some 9.7% to market capitalization after a difficult weekend that saw prices of several coins plunge as much as 15%.  Bitcoin (BTC) fell to as low as $18,000 in a move that sent the asset below its 2017 highs, with investors locking in a record amount of losses as per on-chain data. Ether (ETH) dropped to $929.  In the past 24 hours, however, Solana’s SOL and ether led gains among the top 10 coins by market capitalization with a 9% bump, while Cardano’s ADA and Polkadot’s DOT rose 7%. Bitcoin saw rejection at $21,000 after a brief recovery.  Outside of the top 10, Avalanche’s AVAX jumped 14%, Polygon’s MATIC added 12% and ApeCoin’s APE rose 16%.  A relief rally  Analysts at Bitfinex’s trading desk said the market jump displayed the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies.  “While the trend of market turbulence is unlikely to recede as central banks call the shots amid an increasingly uncertain geopolitical environment, today’s relief rally demonstrates a latent potential for the price of digital tokens to rebound quickly,” the desk said in a message to CoinDesk.  Most of the crypto gains came amid a jump in broader equity markets as U.S. markets remain shut for the Juneteenth federal holiday. European stock index Stoxx 600 added 0.7%, Germany’s DAX gained 0.58% and Hong Kong’s Hang Send added 0.42%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 lost 0.72%, while the Shanghai Composite finished with nominal losses on Monday.  Market observers, however, remained unconvinced that Monday’s rally in cryptocurrencies will extend into the coming days.  “The market is highly dependent on the [Federal Reserve interest] rate, and inflation is breaking records with the macroeconomic factor remaining heavy,” said Anton Gulin, regional director at crypto exchange AAX. “Uncertainty prevails in the market, and relief rallies do not significantly change this picture.”  “Such market moves are a decent opportunity for daytraders but not for investors aiming to cut risks. We shall watch out for how the macro rhetorics change by autumn to see the mid-term direction of the markets,” Gulin added.  U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hiked rates by 75 basis points last week as the agency combats rising inflation and strives to bring costs under control. Inflation hit 8.6% in May, an increase of 0.3 percentage points from analyst expectations, and several more rate hikes are expected before September.  'We haven't hit the bottom yet'  Some say such a macroeconomic climate is unlikely to support the continued recovery of the crypto market.  “Even though the recent price action has provided somewhat of a sigh of relief for bitcoin prices, it’s foolish to forgo the wider macro context in which crypto and finance operate,” Andrey Diyakonov, chief commercial officer at Choise, said in a Telegram message.  “Commodities market indicators and [European Union] bonds market meltdown spell out worrying predictions for the world economy,” Diyakono stated, adding recent troubles seen at the crypto lender Celsius and prominent fund Three Arrows Capital have added to ""crypto industry uncertainty.”  “We haven’t hit the bottom yet,” Diyakonov concluded.  Vasja Zupan, president of crypto exchange Matrix, seconded the sentiment.  “I don't see bitcoin quickly returning to all-time high levels. We should probably brace ourselves for a long period of uncertainty during the crypto winter,” Zupan said in a Telegram message, adding a “strong recovery” to all-time highs could be on the cards when market sentiment turns positive.  “Bitcoin is also heavily influenced by global market sentiment, and when that changes, the asset will move much faster than other markets,” Zupan said.  Support for bitcoin exists at the $18,000 mark if the asset loses current trading levels, price charts show.

An entity that was forced to liquidate its positions as BTC&apos;s price trended further downside. Hayes believes that Canada&apos;s Bitcoin Purpose Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) was potentially responsible for the downside price action. The investment vehicle is settled by physical BTC and, according to Purpose, when a client buys the ETF, they are buying &apos;real Bitcoin&apos;.

The app allows sellers to create custom orders for their NFTs that can be sent directly to buyers. Using ParaSwap’s DEX engine on the backend, both parties would be able to transact in their preferred token.  The app also touts its own native wallet, tapping Ramp as a fiat on-ramp. The app will have zero trading fees for the first three weeks (or until $500,000 is spent) as a promotion, with gas fees on the platform for non-Ethereum transactions being permanently refunded.  “ParaSwap first started in the middle of the bear market in summer 2019, so for us, we're always shooting features regardless of market conditions,” Mounir Benchemled, founder of ParaSwap, told CoinDesk in an interview. “There is nothing like this product in terms of the privacy it offers in the NFT space.”  Popular NFT marketplaces have largely avoided taking their business to the App Store, mainly because Apple (AAPL) takes a 30% cut of all in-app purchases, including the sales of digital goods.

27957,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=240443,1655732705,MATIC Technical Analysis: $1.75 Mark Is A Real Growth Target,"MATIC cryptocurrency has long resisted the downward trend. Some cryptocurrencies have been declining since May 2021, others began their decline in November 2021. MATIC cryptocurrency updated its historical high in November 2021, and the decline began in January 2022. Unfortunately, this fact did not allow buyers to keep local lows from May 2021. In April 2021, the MATIC price fall was quite aggressive. In June, sellers pushed the price below $0.57. To do this, sellers needed to break the candle from 9 May and put three more weeks of exhausting pressure on the price. Source: https://www.tradingview.com/x/0ExUzKua/ Thus, the MATIC price fell to the range of $0.35, where buyers were once gaining ground for a new growth wave. Given the uncorrected fall in the MATIC price from April 2022 and the availability of the liquidity level, we expect the beginning of the formation of a price rebound. To implement a positive scenario and increase the price to $1.75, buyers must take control of the mark of $0.57. If local growth ends near $0.57, the MATIC market will expect a new fall wave with the first target of $0.22. MATIC Technical Analysis On The Daily Timeframe Analyzing the movement of MATIC prices on the daily timeframe, we can identify two opportunities for investment. Buyers are now forming a local price rebound that could end near the local $0.44 mark.

As of February 2021, this liquidity zone has come under the control of buyers and still plays a supporting function for the TRX price. The last attempt of sellers to break the $0.05 range took place during the trading week on June 13. During this week, the BTC price was able to update its local low and test the mark of $17,900. Source: https://www.tradingview.com/x/5pTPDovl/ As a result, the $0.05 mark remained and buyers have a new chance to form a new growth wave. Trading volumes during this trading week were also increased, which shows a real struggle in the market, rather than the manipulative antics of big players. Therefore, the formation of a price rebound with the first target of $0.086 is likely to be realized. This target limits the upper trend line of the consolidation triangle. Until buyers can break the $0.086 mark and establish control over the retest - we do not predict the next growth target. It is likely that above the $0.086 TRX price will not have the strength to move. If buyers are not able to break this markup, we will expect the formation of a new fall wave to the mark of $0.025.

The round included True Ventures, Arrington Capital, Ethereal Ventures, Wintermute, Genesis Trading, LedgerPrime, Hypersphere Ventures, The LAO and many others. (Genesis is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  Astaria allows users to put up their NFTs as collateral to earn instant liquidity. According to co-founder and CEO Justin Bram, the recent dip in NFT sales followed by signals of a bear market makes Astaria’s services attractive for NFT owners looking to earn passive income on their digital assets.  “We’re very bullish on NFTs and bringing real assets in the future,” Bram told CoinDesk, when asked about current trends in NFT markets. “Over the next three to five years our hope is that we will expand well beyond art-based NFTs and profile picture NFTs.”  Users who put their NFTs up as collateral can use Astaria to take out loans in ether (ETH). According to co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Joseph Delong, a crypto veteran who previously led decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Sushi and worked at ConsenSys, Astaria will eventually integrate multiple chains beyond Ethereum to support loans in other cryptocurrencies.  “We know Ethereum will be here in three, five years. We don’t know which other layer 1s [blockchains] will be. We don’t know which layer 2s [companion systems] will succeed,” said Bram on the topic of cross-chain expansion.  The market for NFT lending services has grown over the past year, with companies such as NFTfi and Arcade providing peer-to-peer lending services. Astaria differs in that it will not mandate two-way approvals, in an effort to make transactions more efficient.  According to Bram, Astaria plans to use the funding round to expand its current eight-person team. He says the platform’s public launch could come as early as September.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/20/ex-sushi-cto-raises-8m-for-nft-lending-platform-astaria,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/82e5d86f2a28e53277a30eb211fd154bae5041f2-1500x1002.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Realized loss denotes the total loss (U.S. dollar value) of all moved coins whose price at their last movement was higher than the price at the current movement, as per Glassnode. The tool can be used to measure how many coins moved at any particular price.  Approximately 555,000 BTC have changed hands between prices of $18,000 and $23,000, a strong support and resistance level respectively for the asset ranged over the past few days, the firm said. Losses ranged between $1.5 billion and $2 billion each day, data shows.  Long-term holders, or those holding BTC for a period longer than 155 days, liquidated over 178,000 BTC at prices below $23,000, the data showed. However, these liquidations accounted for only 1.31% of the total holdings.  As per blockchain data, some of these holders purchased their coins at $69,000, bitcoin’s lifetime high, and sold at $18,000, taking on a loss of nearly 75%, Glassnode said.  Such liquidations could have contributed to bitcoin falling to under $20,000 over the weekend. Bitcoin fell to as low as $18,319 a coin while its market capitalization slumped to about $350 billion, a 73% decline from its November all-time high, as previously reported.  Bitcoin saw resistance at $21,000 on Monday morning after a relief rally saw some $2,000 added to prices over the past 24 hours. The $21,000 level has acted as support in the past weeks, price charts show.  In broader futures markets, bitcoin futures racked up some $436 million in liquidations over the past three days. Long options, or bets on higher prices, took on a majority of these losses, data from Coinglass shows.  The move came as bitcoin fell steeply last week amid a fall in the broader equity market as inflation exceeded analyst estimates and the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) hiked rates by 75 basis points – the highest in 28 years.  Meanwhile, Glassnode analysts said data at current price levels suggested a market bottom. “We can see that as prices hit the $17,000 lows [Sunday], just 49% of the $BTC supply was in profit,” the firm said in a tweet citing its Percent Supply in Profit tool.  “Historical bear markets have bottomed and consolidated with between 40% and 50% of supply in profit,” Glassnode said.

42423085,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2Mgph,1655726400,"Gaming Firm Admix Reaches $300M Valuation Following Merger, Rebrand","Admix, a gaming company specializing in non-intrusive, in-game product placements, has reached a $300 million valuation after merging with LandVault, the metaverse’s largest construction company, the companies announced Monday.  The newly merged entity, which will be branded as LandVault, now counts more than 160 staff among its ranks, including 100 metaverse developers and artists. Adding to the new company’s resources is the $25 million in growth capital Admix raised in its Series B funding round last October and the gaming company’s roster of large brands seeking to enter the metaverse.  The merger enhances the companies’ access to “substantial financial resources and thousands of brand partners,” LandVault founder Ryan Inman said in a press release.  “The merger with Admix gives LandVault enhanced opportunities to lead this metaverse,” said Inman.  Making the decision to merge  The merger comes on the heels of Admix’s first metaverse project launch in February, as the company noticed a large market for building out big brands’ metaverse experiences. In the short time since February, revenue from the company’s metaverse offering has exceeded its media revenue for the past two years, Admix CEO Sam Huber told CoinDesk.  As Huber’s team received more and more requests from big brands to help them enter the metaverse, the need for a merger with a metaverse construction company became clear.  As the largest, platform-agnostic metaverse construction company focused on The Sandbox, Decentraland and NFT World metaverses, LandVault was a good match for Admix. The founders also discovered they shared an “aligned sense of vision” for the future of Web3, Huber told CoinDesk.  Crypto winter's impact  Since being founded in 2018, Admix has grown its client list to more than 5,000 advertisers, including Google, Amazon (AMZN), McDonald’s (MCD), Facebook, Uber and PayPal (PYPL), that are looking to engage audiences inside virtual game worlds and, increasingly, the metaverse.  Many companies view the metaverse as the next frontier of digital media advertising and are eager to connect and engage with audiences there, Huber says. And despite recent concerns over the crypto winter that has caused metaverse land values to fall, Huber is confident brands will continue to take the Web3 plunge.  “It's in the mainstream news that crypto is not doing well right now from a price point of view, but I think that's very separate from the promise of the metaverse,” Huber said.“Maybe some brands who are not true believers are going to delay entering the metaverse now, but I think we can still build a very big business on the brands that are brought in.”  Read More: Metaverse Real Estate – Next Big Thing or Next Big Boondoggle?",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MANA | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,Elizabeth Napolitano,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/20/metaverses-largest-builder-reaches-300m-valuation-following-merger-rebrand,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

Job cuts might amount to about 30% of the workforce, according to crypto journalist Colin Wu, who cited unidentified sources. The Dubai-based firm has a headcount of around 2,000.  Bybit joins fellow crypto firms in cutting jobs. Coinbase (COIN) said last week it was laying off 1,100 employees –around 18% of its workforce – while crypto lender BlockFi said it would reduce its headcount by more than 170 – roughly 20%. Crypto.com said it would cut about 5% of its workforce, amounting to around 260 employees.  ""We are exploring a way to remove overlapping functions and build smaller but more agile teams to improve our efficiency,"" a Bybit spokesperson told CoinDesk. ""Starting from this week, some of the functions and roles will be reviewed to ensure we stay focused and agile.""

42374607,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw0yMT,1655722632,"Decoupling of Lido’s Staked ETH Differs From Stablecoin Collapse, CoinShares Says","The decoupling of ether (ETH) and Lido Finance’s staked ether (stETH) is not equivalent to the breaking of the link between terraUSD (UST) and the dollar, and isn’t an example of a stablecoin collapse, according to CoinShares.  Unlike a stablecoin, stETH does not have to trade 1:1 to function correctly, CoinShares wrote in a June 16 report. Moreover, because Ethereum has not enabled withdrawals from staking, there are “no arbitrage opportunities to keep the price in check.”  Staked ether is an Ethereum-based token representing ETH that’s been staked on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake Beacon Chain. StETH has tended to trade at a similar price to ETH because there’s a 1:1 claim relationship. However, after UST lost its peg last month, stETH began trading at a roughly 2% discount and at times as low as a 6% discount.  This is not the same as the UST crash because the underlying asset, ETH, is not directly affected by the market price of stETH, CoinShares said. The benefit of stETH is that it allows users to earn yield from staking ether, using a technique known as liquid staking. The ETH that’s been staked continues to secure the network as planned, while users have access to a liquid asset that can be invested. Lido’s product can be classified as “premature” because the inability to un-stake makes the stETH feature incomplete, according to the report.  The Ethereum community has become concerned over the amount of power that Lido has amassed because the liquid staking derivative has around one-third of all staked ether locked up in its contract, CoinShares said.  Because the underlying ETH is locked and there’s no planned date to introduce withdrawals, market makers like Celsius may be forced to sell their holdings to meet stETH redemptions, research analyst Marc Arjoon wrote. On-chain data appears to indicate that Celsius has enough assets to match the liabilities in the event that all stETH is redeemed “but given the opaqueness of centralized entities this is not certain,” according to the report.  Swissborg, BlockFi, Hodlnaut, Abra, Salt Lending and Nexo may also have to fulfill redemptions, the note said.  CoinShares says that longer-term investors whose profit and loss (P&L) is denominated in ETH could see this as a buying opportunity because stETH will become redeemable 1:1 when withdrawals are enabled. Conversely, investors with shorter-term horizons and U.S. dollar -denominated P&L will probably need to exit their positions, while arbitrageurs may also be buying stETH at a discount and shorting ETH, it added.  Recent updates on Ethereum’s testnets have been positive, which brings more confidence to those waiting on the Merge, and when withdrawals are finally enabled, any discount in stETH will likely be arbitraged away, but until then there will exist some form of discount, the report said.

DOGE rose to as much as 6.3 cents in early Asian hours on Monday. It has since dropped to 5.7 cents at writing time as traders took profits on their positions.

The anonymous wallet at the heart of the crisis had deposited 95% of Solend’s entire SOL pool and represented 88% of USDC borrowing. But Solend’s single-largest user came dangerously close to a massive margin call with SOL’s cratering price. If SOL hit $22.30, the protocol would automatically liquidate up to 20% of the whale’s collateral.  The SLND2 proposal, as well as invalidating the previous proposal, also increases governance voting time to one day.  SLND2 received 1,480,264 ""yes"" votes and 3,535 ""no"" votes with a majority of 99.8%. One wallet paid $700,000 for additional voting power, ultimately making up 90% of votes.  The Solend team will now ""work on a new proposal that does not involve emergency powers to take over an account,"" according to the company's blog.  “We recognize that a voting time of 1 day is still short,” a blog post by co-founder Rooter said, “but we need to act swiftly to address the systemic risk and fact that normal users can’t withdraw USDC.""

The 24-hour trading volume of Elrond is $78 Million, indicating a drop of 6%. Past Performance of EGLD The crypto crash in April has taken a significant toll on EGLD prices as it started a long streak of lower high formation. The downtrend drops to $40 within three months and accounts for an 80% drop in market value since April.

The RSI slope shows a growth in the underlying bullishness and a bullish divergence in the double bottom.

Augmented and virtual reality equipment create real-life sensations for the realization of normal stimuli and corresponding responses. However, like any social construct, the potential of experiencing metaverse crime exists, and there is a need to understand what measures need to be in place. First, let us understand why there is crime potential in the metaverse. Metaverses Mimic Real World Human Experiences Metaverse platforms such as Meta take user interaction from the webpages where written words, audio-visual and automated reactions define social experiences. They allow users to get first-hand experience by entering the spaces as avatars that see and engage with other users as people do in real life. The digital twins own property in the form of NFTs, which allow them to trade in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). The digital space with such social interactions carries the danger of exposure to criminal activity such as cyberbullying, assault, and theft. The metaverse crime rate can only reach the highest levels given the lack of defined policing measures that keep up with the evolving technology.

The anonymous wallet at the heart of the crisis had deposited 95% of Solend’s entire SOL pool and represented 88% of USDC borrowing. But Solend’s single-largest user came dangerously close to a massive margin call with SOL’s cratering price. If SOL hit $22.30, the protocol would automatically liquidate up to 20% of the whale’s collateral.  Solend, which supports tokens such as SOL and USDC, is giving its governance token holders six hours to vote on the proposal. Voting “yea” on SLND2 would: 1. Invalidate the first vote; 2. Extend voting periods to one day’s length; 3. Begin work on a new, less drastic “emergency powers”-free solution to the whale wallet crisis.  “We recognize that a voting time of 1 day is still short,” a blog post by co-founder Rooter said, “but we need to act swiftly to address the systemic risk and fact that normal users can’t withdraw USDC. We ask our community to be active in governance in the next few days. Voting time will be revisited in a future proposal.”  The liquidation crisis  Protocol developers feared that multimillion-dollar liquidation would flood Solana decentralized exchanges with too much sell pressure and even jam the network. They pushed through a vote to commandeer the whale wallet and execute its liquidation more seamlessly via OTC.  Crypto Twitter erupted. An attorney called it “illegal;” a popular personality scoffed at the low turnout repo; a chain founder derided the seat-of-pants governance hack job; a competing lending service on Ethereum said it was “an indictment of [decentralized finance] on Solana.”  “The crazy backlash” on Twitter and in the press forced Solend back to the drawing board, pseudonymous founder Rooter told CoinDesk in a telegram message. SOL price recovery has granted a bit of liquidation wiggle room, Rooter said, but the issue of what to do about the nonresponsive whale wallet remains.  “$120M worth of USDC is stuck in the protocol that average users can't withdraw,” Rooter said (the whale’s loans alone have locked up $108 million in value).  The new vote had not yet passed at press time early Monday. Like the previous one, it will require a 1% quorum, a difficult bar to reach when token whales such as VCs are hesitant to tip the scales. Indeed, the previous proposal only passed because a single account stepped into juice turnout.  “I guess one silver lining is [because] of all the (negative) attention we've gotten, participation should be much higher than average,” Rooter said.",NEGATIVE,SOL | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SOL | TRADING | USDC,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/20/solends-whale-liquidation-crisis-prompts-second-vote-to-reverse-emergency-powers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a98cd8165422338fd11948c059047ec3140be0c2-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Inflation in fiat-based economies is imminent, hence, the need for buffers against the adverse effects of inflation. Store of value investments such as Gold, stocks, real estate, bonds, or precious metals has been considered tools and investments that have worked as hedges for a long time. Cryptocurrencies have currently been embraced by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as investable assets. Store of value assets and good inflation hedges, known as hard assets, should be capable of holding purchasing power over time. Fundamental properties linked with hard assets are scarcity, accessibility, and durability. Crypto As a Store-Of-Value Utility and scarcity are critical prerequisites to value, both of which are inherent in cryptocurrencies. The utility is the purpose of these cryptocurrencies and the problem they seek to address or improve processes. Scarcity refers to the number of digital coins or tokens in circulation. Regarding utility, one can use bitcoin as a store of value, ether to implement a pre-programmed code through smart contracts, and litecoin for payment of goods and services.
