42429354,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxcHh,1530813088,IBM Wants to Track Code Milestones on a Blockchain,"A new patent application from IBM outlines a way for developers to catalog coding updates and milestones on a blockchain.  The application – entitled ""Blockchain For Program Code Credit and Programmer Contribution in a Collective"" – was published on July 5 by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). It envisions utilizing the technology to create ""a secure and robust approach to track and to append information related to collaborative coding for the purpose of credit, reward, and dispute resolution, and for other purposes.""  Put more simply, the idea is to use a distributed network to track the accomplishments of coders as they work together on a project. As the application suggests, such tracking can be used to properly credit design elements to specific programmers.  As IBM argues in the application, programmers normally need to collaborate to produce a software product, but an effective approach measuring a programmer's contribution is lacking. The principle underlying the proposed patent is a chain that chronicles the code transactions and parameters on blockchain blocks.  As IBM goes on to explain:  ""Code transactions and parameters associated with a stakeholder are compiled into a chain of programmer transaction blockchain blocks. The chain can be considered a chronicle of a piece of software, …and the code ""status"" path through its recent history or complete history can be tracked, along with its various programmers, though the lifetime and versions of the code, various history parameters, etc.""  ""Once the new block has been calculated, it can be appended to the stakeholder's application software history blockchain, as described above. The block may be updated in response to many triggers, such as, when a programmer selects a button on a graphical user interface (GUI) on a computer display showing a code editor to add code, when a unit test has been completed, when a code integration is completed, when an assigned work item is closed, and so forth,"" the company goes on to note..  IBM itself is no stranger to intellectual property bids tied to blockchain technology, as the USPTO routinely publishes filings submitted by IBM.

42429339,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxbjh,1530804865,Another Ripple Lawsuit Claims XRP Is A Security,"Ripple is facing another class-action lawsuit tied to the legal classification of the XRP cryptocurrency.  A lawsuit filed in the Superior Court of California (San Mateo County) claims that Ripple ""created the XRP token and then used sales of the tokens in order to fund its operations and the development of the XRP ecosystem."" Filed by California resident David Oconer, the complaint names Ripple Labs, XRP II (Ripple's licensed money services business), Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and 25 unnamed persons affiliated with the firms as defendants.  The suit claims:  ""Here, the XRP offered and sold by the defendants had all the traditional hallmarks of a security, yet defendants failed to register them as such. The purchase of XRP constitutes an investment contract, as XRP purchasers, including plaintiff, provided consideration (in the form of fiat, such as U.S. dollars, or other cryptocurrencies) in exchange for XRP. XRP purchasers reasonably expected to derive profits from their ownership of XRP, and defendants themselves have frequently highlighted this profit motive.""  Like previous lawsuits, Oconer's filing seeks damages for the price drop from earlier this year, noting that while traditional securities would afford owners some measure of control over the firm, XRP does not. Oconer goes a step further, claiming that Ripple has complete control over the XRP ledger and that the network is not decentralized like bitcoin or ethereum.  The suit comes on the heels of two others with similar claims. Former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Mary Jo White and former SEC official Andrew Ceresney are representing the company in the first suit, though it is unclear whether they will do so for the second, third and fourth ones.  Further, New York-based law firm Skadden Arps is representing Ripple in at least one of the suits, a representative told CoinDesk.  Previously, Garlinghouse has publicly stated that ""XRP is not a security,"" claiming that the XRP ledger is decentralized, independent of Ripple Labs and that purchasing XRP tokens does not give investors ownership of Ripple.  A spokesperson for Ripple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Notably, a similarly-constructed lawsuit was also filed this week by investor Avner Greenwald, public records show. That lawsuit also alleges that XRP is a security.  This article has been updated.

As such, the BIS head contended that the activities associated with cryptocurrency represents an effort to create money out of nothing.  ""Young people should use their many talents and skills for innovation, not reinventing money. It's a fallacy to think money can be created from nothing,"" Carstens said, adding:  ""Glance back into the past and you will see that creating gold or money from nothing has been a regular obsession.

42429356,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxcFh,1530788401,Bitcoin's Price Rally Hits Speed Bump in Push to $7K,"Bitcoin (BTC) needs to overcome a key technical resistance to keep the short-term bull market going, technical studies indicate.  The leading cryptocurrency rose to $6,785 on Bitfinex on Wednesday - the highest level since June 22 - and looked set to test the psychological hurdle of $7,000, as suggested by Monday's bullish breakout.  However, the bulls failed to muster enough momentum to cross $6,754 (23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the drop from $9,990 to $5,755) on a daily closing basis (as per UTC), establishing the Fibonacci level as a stiff resistance.  Further, a detailed look at the technical charts reveals the area around $6,754 is packed with moving average lines and Bollinger Band, all working in unison to put brakes on BTC price rally.  Hence, a convincing break above the resistance needs to happen soon, else a price pullback could be in the offing.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,620 on Bitfinex.  4-hour chart  The above chart shows:  The upper Bollinger Band (standard deviation of +2,2 on 20-candle moving average) is located at $6,570, the 200-candle moving average (MA) is seen at $6,717, and the 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement is located at $6,754.  Bollinger Bands are sloping upwards in favor of the bulls.  BTC is trading above 50-candle MA and 100-candle MA and both MAs are trending north (biased to the bulls).  The cryptocurrency has created a rising channel-like structure. (bullish setup).  Clearly, the odds are stacked in favor of a convincing move above the resistance zone of $6,717-$6,770. The bullish setup in the daily chart also favors a rally to $7,000.  However, if BTC fails to pick up a bid in the next few hours, the focus will likely shift to the bearish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence seen in the 4-hour chart. In this case, the rising channel could be breached to the downside, triggering a deeper pullback in BTC prices.  View  An aggressive move above the resistance zone of $6,717 - $6,770 would add credence to the bullish setup in the 4-hour and daily chart and would allow a rally to $7,000.  The focus would shift to the bearish RSI divergence (seen in the 4-hour chart) if BTC fails to cut through the resistance zone of $6,717-$6,770 in the next few hours. In this case, prices could fall back to $6,330 (50-candle MA on 4-hour chart).  A close below $6,275 (Monday's low) would abort the bullish view.

The Thailand Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued an announcement on Wednesday that outlines when the new rule kicks in, making Thailand one of the first countries to allow ICOs in a regulated environment. The SEC said under the new regulatory framework, any entity seeking to conduct an ICO must first file an application for approval with the regulator.  But instead of directly screening applications from individual ICO projects, the SEC will first evaluate filings submitted by so-called ""ICO portals,"" which are online marketplaces where potential ICO organizers can operate their token sales.  The SEC said those approved ICO portals will be responsible for screening projects, after which the applications of those selected projects will then be considered.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the new law is a result of a months-long process that saw public hearings and legislative debates regarding how to regulate cryptocurrency and ICOs in the country. A royal decree on the matter was initially announced in May.  The SEC said ICO portal applicants must be registered businesses in Thailand with a minimum registered capital of 5 million baht, or $150,000. These portals must have adequate resources to evaluate an ICO issuer's business plan, project structure, technical capacity, and source code, according to officials.  In addition, the SEC said only Thai baht and seven cryptocurrencies can be accepted in token sales, including bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum, ethereum classic, litecoin, XRP, and lumens.

The article below has been amended accordingly.  ---  Romania has drafted an emergency ordinance for electronic forms of money, a local news outlet reported Thursday.  The draft, which was released by the Romanian Ministry of Finance, states that groups hoping to launch e-monies must have their tax and legal records verified. Following that, each member of the issuing organization is required to be approved by the Romanian National Bank (BNR), according to Business Review.  If approved, the draft would make BNR the sole authority over such products in the country.  BNR claims it would grant authorization to firms when it finds the applicants have ""a formal framework for the management of the carefully designed electronic money issuance activity.""  This framework must include a structure with ""well-defined, transparent and coherent responsibility lines,"" efficient risk-management processes and ""adequate internal control mechanisms"" for issuing such forms of money, officials have reportedly outlined.  The draft ordinance also defines electronic money. It explains that the government sees it as ""monetary value stored electronically, including magnetic, representing a claim on the issuer issued on receipt of funds for the purpose of performing payment transactions and which is accepted by a person other than the issuer of electronic money.""  Once in effect, the authorization will only last for a 12-month period. If the approved issuers don't issue the money before the deadline, they will lose the authorization.

Zebpay, the largest crypto exchange in India by trading volume, said in a tweet on Wednesday it had paused the Indian rupee deposit and withdrawal services following the Supreme Court's decision earlier this week.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the Supreme Court said Tuesday that the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) circular issued in April will ""remain implemented,"" which prohibits banks and other regulated financial firms from doing business with crypto exchanges.  However, Zebpay said that its fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-crypto trading services are still active. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Zebpay has seen over $5 million trading volume in the past 24 hours.  While the company has not issued any further statements on the court's decision, Ajeet Khurana, chief executive of Zebpay, said in a tweet:  ""Am very sad! But we will continue our relentless efforts to get things sorted. I am sure crypto is good for India. If we, as a nation, do not make up our mind, we will be caught on the wrong side of history and miss the crypto bus. And that will be a tragedy.""  In a similar move, several exchanges in India with relatively smaller volume also announced they would suspend fiat currency deposit and withdrawal services for now, such as Coinome and Pexo.  Meanwhile, other exchanges don't appear to be deterred and have said they will continue to allow deposits and withdrawals of fiat currency even if the RBI's circular indicated that July 5 was the deadline for bank account closures.  For instance, BitBNS, an exchange with over $1.4 million 24-hour trading volume on CoinMarketCap, confirmed on Twitter on Tuesday it will continue the service for depositing and withdrawing Indian rupee after July 5.  The exchange has not responded to CoinDesk's inquiry for further details. Similarly, another smaller exchange named KoinOK also claimed its fiat currency deposit and withdrawal services are still working.  On the other hand, shifting to over-the-counter trading has also become one strategy that several Indian exchanges are taking to circumvent the RBI's bank account curb.  KoinEX, an exchange that has reported $1.5 million in trades over the past day, has collaborated with another platform called WazirX to launch a peer-to-peer trading service dubbed KoinLoop, according to a local news report published Tuesday.

Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the RiskBlock Alliance, whose members include such insurance heavyweights as Chubb, Marsh and Liberty Mutual, has decided to build its first set of use cases using R3's Corda platform.  The news comes soon after B3i, the European reinsurance consortium, decided to switch from Hyperledger Fabric to Corda. With the addition of RiskBlock, R3 now counts all the major insurance blockchain consortia as Corda users, including the Insurwave marine insurance platform created by EY and Maersk as well as regional initiatives in India and Italy.  RiskBlock was officially launched in mid-2017 by The Institutes, an insurance research and education network, but the team behind the DLT consortium has spent at least two years testing enterprise blockchain solutions. Earlier this year, RiskBlock narrowed down its choices to a short list: Quorum (developed by JPMorgan Chase), Hyperledger Fabric, Corda, and Digital Asset.  ""We went through an intense and laborious process and finally narrowed it down to two, which were Corda and Digital Asset,"" Patrick Schmid, a vice president at RiskBlock, told CoinDesk, adding:  ""It was a close race – and we haven't worked out all the details yet – but we have decided on Corda and we are moving in that direction.""  RiskBlock was a founding member of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance and much of the early work, including several proofs-of-concept, was done on a private version of ethereum, the world's second-largest blockchain. However, the insurance consortium started to change course this year as it received input from member firms and also some of its potential partners.  Privacy – or, rather, the lack thereof in a system forked from a public network – was the dealbreaker for these companies, according to Schmid.  ""What we learned from testing ethereum was that our members found huge value in the smart contracts, and found huge value in blockchain-enabled technology. But they were a little bit concerned about data segregation,"" he said.""Even with a private variant of ethereum, their concern really was around data being stored, even if it's encrypted and hashed, on every node in the system.""  The new RiskBlock applications are proofs of insurance (with the goal of weeding out uninsured motorists); more efficient forms of data sharing when a policyholder first notifies an insurer it will be filing a claim; subrogation (think of when your auto insurance carrier pays you after an accident and then pursues the other driver's carrier for reimbursement), with a focus on blockchain-based net settlement; and parametric insurance, which is paid out automatically when a triggering event such as a natural catastrophe occurs.  In terms of a timeline, Schmid said, ""Everything is in progress now. We anticipate that we'll have POI and First Notice of Loss fully complete and ready for member testing before the end of summer.""  Insurance and interoperability  Landing RiskBlock is another important validation for R3's technology at a time when the bank-owned startup is rumored to be struggling financially. The company is set to release the commercial version of its enterprise software next week.  ""Over the last few months we have seen several insurers migrate to Corda due to its enhanced privacy and scalability; information is shared on a bi-lateral or multi-lateral basis, meaning parties that are not involved in the transaction will not see it,"" said Ryan Rugg, global head of insurance at R3.  ""Corda gives insurers the ability to integrate and secure disparate data sources, whilst simultaneously ensuring transparency across an interconnected network of clients, brokers, insurers and other third parties,"" she added.  In a sense, B3i's switch from Hyperledger to Corda made fellow insurance consortium RiskBlock more likely to settle on the R3 platform as well, all else equal.  That's because, according to Schmid, the potential to ""make interoperability an immediate thing"" was a big factor in the platform selection process at RiskBlock.  ""One of the major catalysts for us to narrow our selection process down to ranking Corda at the top was that it's potentially also going to be leveraged by European reinsurers in the B3i initiative and by the InsurWave initiative – and some other smaller initiatives,"" he said.  B3i, founded by insurance giants Allianz, Aegon and Swiss Re, and supported by AIG and AIA, gave similar reasons as RiskBlock in explaining its switch from Hyperledger Fabric to Corda.  ""After re-evaluating our criteria around data privacy, developer productivity and interoperability we concluded that Corda is a perfect fit for our insurance use cases and also for our future strategy for an insurance business network,"" Markus Tradt, CTO at B3i, told CoinDesk.  Tradt said B3i's vision goes far beyond single-purpose blockchain deployments for a specific use case and that his consortium is working with partners and third parties for application developments.  Hence, ""interoperability is crucial for us,"" he said, ""To that end, we are actively pursuing collaboration or partnerships with other platforms and initiatives.""

The document continued:  ""The introduction of blockchain - in administrative concessions, contracting or internal processes - will encourage greater control, traceability and transparency in the processes. In addition, the use of this technology can also bring extra revenue to the Administration through the promotion of new models of exchange of rights in sectors such as logistics, tourism or infrastructure. ""  Moreover, the lawmakers recommended building public and private blockchain models ""in order to favor secondary markets for goods and services that lower costs, increase productivity and encourage the creation of specialized employment.""  To that end, the proposal also recommends that the government facilitate training for developers ""in order to improve their implementation as much as possible.""
