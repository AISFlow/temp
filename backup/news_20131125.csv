42425145,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHsrjh,1385400018,"Exante's Bitcoin Fund Reports YTD Performance of 4,847%","Although technically launched in late 2012, Malta-based brokerage Exante released their 2013 year-to-date (YTD) performance statistics for The Bitcoin Fund last week. Listed in Bloomberg's Comparative Fund Analysis section, The Bitcoin Fund came in with a 4,847% return, leading its peer group by a wide margin.  The closest funds in the comparative analysis registered a year-to-date performance of 33.7% and 25.4% respectively. The Bitcoin Fund gives institutions and high-net worth individuals easy, secure and rapid access to the vibrant bitcoin market with a unique licensed product.  The company also offers a reliable secondary market for the trading of fund shares on both a long and short position basis. Recognising that speculative bitcoin trades exceeded transactions for goods and services by 20 to 25 times in the latest quarter, Exante co-founder Vladimir Maslyakov told Bloomberg that:  ""The real economy is not growing as fast as the price, speculators are usually much faster.""  It is impossible to know with certainty the motives behind a trade (or if liquidity-enhancing speculation is even detrimental), but this new chart from Blockchain.info attempts to measure the ratio of trade volume to transaction volume, as explained by David Perry.  However, this imbalance is expected to adjust as Bitcoin has now surpassed PayPal and Discover to become the world's fifth largest payment network by daily transaction volume, as measured by Coinometrics.  Lately, increasing demand for bitcoin has been driven by China which recently eclipsed the US in active bitcoin nodes on the network. This rapid price appreciation tends to put pressure on bitcoin-related startups because entrepreneurs must increasingly justify how a placement into their company will yield a higher rate of return than simply investing straight into the digital currency. Building out the ecosystem benefits everyone.  Arguably, bitcoin represents a binary investment: either ultimate success as a world reserve currency, or capitulation to a zero price point.  The key challenge for venture capitalists and startup investors will be to leverage any investment into a scalable infrastructure company for dual participation by maintaining asset balances denominated in bitcoin. It would be counter-productive to financially support a bitcoin ecosystem company without also supporting the underlying base currency.  Union Square Ventures' Fred Wilson seems to miss this point when he declares that his primary interest in Bitcoin is its ability to become the ""financial and transactional protocol"" for the global Internet, and that he and his firm own very little bitcoin. Wilson makes this statement as if Bitcoin can achieve the lofty protocol role without any impact on the monetary value of the underlying base currency unit.  It is almost as if he believes that USV's portfolio company Coinbase will be better off by converting bitcoin-operational proceeds into US dollars and keeping balance sheet assets in US dollars. Unfortunately, I suspect this is the case at Coinbase.  Meanwhile, the Exante Bitcoin Fund’s assets under management currently total over $35m and the fund does not charge a performance-based fee because there is no discretionary management or use of leverage. However, there is an annual management fee of 1.75% as well as a 0.5% transaction fee.  Exante is regulated by the Malta Financial Authority and, as of 18th November, the value per unit of the Bitcoin Fund was $658 where one unit equals one bitcoin. Exante is not alone in the bitcoin fund business, since SecondMarket launched the private, open-ended Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) in September 2013.  The private investment vehicle is based in the US and open to institutional and accredited individual investors. SecondMarket also intends to facilitate two-way trading of the trust shares on its proprietary platform to enable both long and short positions. Barry Silbert, CEO, said:  ""US investors, including wealthy families, are allocating more of their investments into Bitcoins in order to diversify portfolios.""  Silbert also confirmed that he's working with Pensco Trust Co, Entrust Group Inc and Equity Trust Co to offer investors the ability to purchase bitcoin for individual retirement accounts. In a little under two months, SecondMarket’s Bitcoin Investment Trust has already attracted $46.8m under management.

42425129,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHsrHh,1385389680,Bitcoin Derivatives Platform BTC.sx Surpasses $13.5 Million in Trades,"An Australian bitcoin derivatives platform has seen $13.5m in trades since founder Joe Lee launched it in May, using $150,000 of his personal savings.  BTC.sx  has recently expanded, with chief operating officer George Samman the latest addition to its Sydney team. As an experienced trader, Samman understands derivatives and how bitcoin investors could use BTC.sx to hedge their bets on the volatile electronic currency. Samman told CoinDesk:  ""BTC.sx brings the world [its] first bitcoin derivative. This is done in an intuitive FX-style trading platform that enables users to profit from a rising or falling bitcoin price.""  FOREX (or FX for short) is an abbreviation of foreign exchange: a 24-hour market that banks and investors use to trade in and out of fiat currency pairs.  ""With our service, hedging your bitcoin positions is now possible. Our platform is designed to interface entirely in bitcoin with no need for a USD/fiat balance to enter both long or short positions,"" said Samman.  Joe Lee, the founder of BTC.sx, has a background in finance, working for institutions including Barclays and Macquarie Bank. Like other investors in the bitcoin economy, it's clear that Lee anticipated the market's need for bitcoin derivatives, and put his money into it. The platform now has over 2,000 registered traders.  Other companies have their sights set on the virtual currency trading market. New York-based Coinsetter has launched its private beta to build a high-speed trading exchange. And Singapore-based itBit has raised $3.5m in venture capital to use NASDAQ's exchange technology to facilitate bitcoin trades.  Samman comments that bitcoin is an excellent investment alternative to both government-backed currencies and the stock market. He explained:  ""Electronic currency is definitely the next evolution in the history of money. Bitcoin offers people a diversification out of currencies that are being de-valued by money printing, and a stock market where scandal after scandal doesn't even make the news of the day.""  He continues: ""What happened in Cyprus is a great example of why bitcoin's future will continue to shine. I mean, would you rather hold the currency of a government that's willing to take it away or devalue it, or one in which market participants decide its value?""  BTC.sx is hoping to expand its operations to offer more derivatives in the future, though Samman did not want to speculate on exactly what the company plans to deliver to investors.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/25/bitcoin-derivatives-platform-btcsx-surpasses-135-million-in-trades,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a7413e083476624f092002d36f817cf2913e5c46-1000x802.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425126,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHsrBh,1385382611,Coinsetter's New Funding Round Almost Complete,"Nascent bitcoin exchange Coinsetter has completed over half of a $1m funding round by crowdsourcing from its early adopters.  Last Monday, CEO Jaron Lukasiewicz sent an email to those who had already signed up for accounts at his exchange to ask if they would like to invest in the interim seed round. Lukasiewicz, who recently launched the public beta version of the exchange, originally secured a $500,000 seed investment in April from a group of angels including: Barry Silbert's Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, Roger Ver and Technology Entrepreneur Jimmy Furland, among others. He says:  “We have commitments and serious interest on over half of our round, and I expect it to be filled completely before our announced cut off date.”  Lukasiewicz has a commitment from several of his original seed funders, although he points out that it isn’t common for original seed investors to be the primary investors in a new round.  He sent the fundraising email to everyone who has signed up for a beta account, which he says will number “in the thousands”. He confirms he has offered these investors a discount on what he hopes will be a “very high” Series A round valuation.  Lukasiewicz reveals that only accredited investors will be able to put money into the company, and adds that he will be accepting bitcoin as a funding option. Which bears the question, why does he need the money so soon after launch, when the service has only just gone into public beta? Lukasiewicz comments:  “We want to hire more developers and make sure that with the launch and initial customer support, our team is of the appropriate size to handle the support and to enable us to keep up with rapid development over the coming months.”  Lukasiewicz has had to scale back and retool his exchange strategy since the idea's initial conception. When he originally raised his seed round in April, the Forex trading platform included margin trading capabilities which have since been removed from the initial version, while conversations around margin trading features have become steadily more muted. Additionally, his strategy around US customers has also pivoted once or twice.  The exchange was initially to serve US customers, but he canned that idea in the summer, following regulatory concerns. Since then, he has decided to serve a US customer base by offering bitcoin-only transactions: avoiding fiat in a bid to evade money services business (MSB) status in individual states. He says:  “You see other companies raising $1m or $2m A rounds, but we did our first round when no one cared about bitcoin and we raised $500,000. If we had been able to raise that kind of capital just from the get-go, people would have seen us also develop and reach the market much more quickly.""  Lukasiewicz reveals that the company is beginning to gather feedback from beta users, enabling it to guide the direction of development with greater precision.  “There are a high proportion of people on Wall Street making commitments to invest in this round,” said Lukasiewicz, adding that one of the goals in his approach was to bring new investors into the fold.  He is looking for all commitments to be finalised by this Friday (29th November).

42425133,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHsrPh,1385373586,"Bitcoin Payment Processor BIPS Attacked, Over $1 Million Stolen","Europe’s primary bitcoin payment processor for merchants and free online wallet service, BIPS, was the target of a major DDoS attack and subsequent theft in the past few days that saw 1,295 BTC (just over $1m on CoinDesk’s BPI) stolen.  Kris Henriksen, BIPS’ CEO, said most of the missing funds were “from the company’s own holdings”. BIPS uses an algorithm, based on supply and demand, to work out the amount of bitcoins it needs to keep it in a ‘hot wallet’. The heist, however, was apparently not due to any vulnerability in the code itself.  He also said merchants who had chosen to instantly convert their bitcoin to fiat currency bank accounts were not affected.  Theft  The Copenhagen, Denmark-based company was targeted on 15th November by a massive DDoS attack. Then on 17th November, it was followed up by a subsequent attack that disabled the site and “overloaded our managed switches and disconnected the iSCSI connection to the SAN on BIPS servers”.  “Regrettably, despite several layers of protection, the attack caused vulnerability to the system, which has then enabled the attacker/s to gain access and compromise several wallets,"" the company said in a written statement.  BIPS believes the two attacks were connected, and at least the initial DDoS attack was “found to originate from Russia and neighboring countries”. The company moved fast to restore full merchant payment and transfer services by 19th November, but disabled all wallet functions in order to complete a full forensic analysis. Its help desk also went down for a few days, but was restored on 22nd November.  Investigation  Under BIPS’ privacy policy, it is not allowed to disclose users’ information to anyone, even the authorities. They will now set up a system for affected wallet users to voluntarily sign the required permission documents, to engage in a more thorough investigation with law enforcement to track down the culprits.  Henriksen stressed that merchant processing “was restored very quickly, and if you had auto-convert on, there is nothing to worry about”.  BIPS’ official statement on its site read:    To protect the successful merchant processing business, BIPS has decided to temporarily close down its consumer wallet initiative.      BIPS has been a target of a coordinated attack and subsequent security breached. Several consumer wallets have been compromised and BIPS will be contacting the affected users.    As a consequence BIPS will temporarily close down the wallet initiative to focus on real-time merchant processing business which does not include storing of bitcoins. Subsequently BIPS will consider to reintroduce the wallet initiative with a re-architected security model.    The consumer wallet initiative has not been BIPS' core business and, as such, regrettably affecting several users has not affected BIPS merchant acquiring.    All existing users will be asked to transfer bitcoins to other wallet solutions, and users affected by the security breach will be contacted.    Restoration of merchant services did little to comfort individual wallet owners, though. On the Bitcoin Talk forum, several users voiced anger at the prospect of losing their funds, and what they saw as unclear statements from BIPS about exactly what had been stolen, from whom, and how much.  One member even created a ‘bips.me potential lawsuit signup form’ for users to input their contact details and number of bitcoins missing, in an effort to prompt a negotiated solution.  Though the attack and theft highlights problems that some online wallet services have faced with security, it is significant given BIPS’ comparatively large user base and prominence in the market. As well as online accounts, BIPS had also offered a paper wallet function for those wishing for a safer long-term storage solution.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/25/bitcoin-payment-processor-bips-attacked-over-1-million-stolen,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8f3a1ebaea6213ef91af25cedae651533f594b59-1024x685.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
