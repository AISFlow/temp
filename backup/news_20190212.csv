In an initial report published Tuesday on Quadriga's progress since it filed for creditor protection in late January, court-appointed monitor Ernst and Young (EY) said that the company accidentally moved more than 100 bitcoins into a cold storage wallet it cannot access.  According to the report:  ""On February 6, 2019, Quadriga inadvertently transferred 103 bitcoins valued at approximately $468,675 [CAD] to Quadriga cold wallets which the Company is currently unable to access. The Monitor is working with Management to retrieve this cryptocurrency from the various cold wallets, if possible.""  The company previously said it was unable to access the cold wallets because its CEO Gerald Cotten, who died while traveling in India in December, was the only one who knew where the private keys were.  EY will take control of the exchange's remaining hot wallet funds by transferring the cryptocurrencies into the professional services firm's own cold wallet, according to Tuesday's report.  This includes 51 bitcoin, 0.014 bitcoin cash SV, 33 bitcoin cash, 2,000 bitcoin gold, 800 litecoin and 950 ether.  EY did not immediately respond to an email asking for the wallet addresses involved.  Devices impounded  According to the report, EY has also taken control of ""various Quadriga electronic devices reportedly owned or used by [former CEO Gerald] Cotten within the Quadriga operation,"" including four laptops, four cell phones and three encrypted USB keys.  These devices are being kept in a safety deposit box EY rented while its forensic group determines the best next steps to try to access them.  EY also said it was working with some third-party payment processors to unlock the exchange's fiat balances, though it has not made any substantive progress to date.  Quadriga disclosed in a previous court filing that it owed its customers $180 million CAD ($137 million USD) in cryptocurrencies, but did not provide a breakdown between the funds held in hot wallets and those held in cold storage.  Tuesday's filing indicates that at the time, the exchange held $902,743 CAD ($682,000 USD) in its hot wallets, meaning it had $179 million CAD (about $136 million USD) in cold storage.

42381557,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nEHz,1550004395,"Litecoin's Halving Is Months Away, But Traders May Already Be Pricing It In","Litecoin has rallied sharply in the first six weeks of 2019, triggering speculation that investors may be pricing in a supply reduction that's scheduled to occur in August.  The world's fourth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently trading at $44, having clocked a high of $47 last week. At that price, LTC was up 56 percent on a year-to-date basis, according to CoinMarketCap data.  LTC picked up a bid near $20 in December, tracking the corrective rally in bitcoin – the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Both moved pretty much in unison in January. Things, however, changed last week, with LTC outshining BTC's 7 percent gain with a 41 percent rise.  LTC's strong performance comes at least five months ahead of the mining reward halving, or the time at which the amount of litecoins produced as a network subsidy for each transaction block falls is cut in half. On Aug. 8, the mining reward will be reduced from 25 LTC to 12.5 LTC.  Markets are always forward-looking and hence could be pricing in the impending supply drop. Validating that argument is historical data, which shows that the cryptocurrency had rallied in the months leading up to the first mining reward halving, which took place on Aug. 25, 2015.  Litecoin's performance in 2014-2015 and 2018-2019As seen above, LTC carved out a long-term low at $1.12 in January 2015 and rose to a high of $8.72 in July before falling back below $4.00 ahead of Aug. 25 – a day when mining rewards fell from 50 LTC to 25 LTC.  So, it could be said that markets bought LTC in seven months prior to reward halving and booked profits a few weeks before the event.  The chart also shows that the cryptocurrency exited the bear market (long-term falling trendline) well before the reward halving.  Litecoin's recent surge is reminiscent of the price action witnessed in early 2015. As noted earlier, the cryptocurrency has appreciated by more than 50 percent in the six-weeks and has crossed the 12-month-long falling trendline.  History seems to be repeating itself and so LTC could spend the next couple of months trading in a sideways manner before seeing a possible gear-shift in June and July.  Such a possibility is also pointed to in the price chart analysis.  Weekly chart  The move through the long-term trendline hurdle was backed by a jump in trading volumes to the highest level since February 2018. The bearish-to-bullish trend change, therefore, looks legitimate.  Bitcoin's Halving History  Litecoin isn't the only cryptocurrency to undergo a reward halving roughly every four years. In fact, so does the world's largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin.  Since bitcoin's inception 10 years ago, the cryptocurrency has experienced two reward halvings, the first on Nov. 28, 2012 and second on July 9, 2016, and is estimated to undergo a third in May of 2020.  As seen in the chart above, both halvings were preceded months in advance by significant price growth and full-fledged bull markets after the event.  Upon close inspection, it's clear the halvings elicit a brief ""sell the news"" reaction from the market in the weeks leading up to the event. In that time, bitcoin witnessed price drops of 30-50 percent, which is comparable to litecoin markets in the few weeks leading up to its first halving.

42430165,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMooNh,1549990806,Co-Founder Quits Avalon Mining Chip Maker Canaan Over 'Differences',"One of the three co-founders of Canaan Creative, maker of the Avalon cryptocurrency mining equipment, has stepped down from the Chinese company’s leadership.  According to government business registration data updated on Jan. 30, Xiangfu Liu will no longer serve as a board member at the Hangzhou-based Canaan Creative – a role he had served since 2013.  Further, a person familiar with the situation said Liu had left his day-to-day management role at the manufacturer and his executive board member position at its holding company, Canaan Inc., which unsuccessfully sought an initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong last year.  Canaan Creative did not respond to requests for comment. But the person close to the company told CoinDesk that Liu left his role due to disagreements with the company’s overall strategy.  Specifically, Canaan Creative’s management wanted to continue building the company as a pure-play manufacturer of chips for crypto mining and artificial intelligence. Unlike rival manufacturer Bitmain, Canaan does not mine crypto itself or run mining pools, and the leadership wanted to keep it that way, in order to justify the company’s sustainability for an IPO, the source said.  However, Liu, who has a background in computer science, believes hardware and software should not be separated entirely in the blockchain industry, meaning companies that make mining equipment should not cut themselves off from mining farms and pool businesses, the source said.  Major shareholder  Nevertheless, Liu, 35, remains a substantial shareholder of Canaan Creative. According to the now-lapsed Hong Kong IPO prospectus, Liu co-founded the firm with Nangeng Zhang and Jiaxuan Li in 2013.  While Zhang serves as Canaan’s chief executive officer, Liu was mainly in charge of the firm’s overseas business strategy and marketing, and he owns about 17.6 percent of Canaan’s total shares. In total, the three co-founders control over 50 percent of the firm.  Liu’s departure from the board also comes amid recent layoffs at Canaan, the source said, declining to disclose their scale.  But Canaan is far from alone in reducing staff, as other mining giants like Bitmain have also undergone layoffs as well as office closures, in part due to the overall bearish market conditions in 2018.  The news also comes weeks after a media report that Canaan Creative is now mulling an application to go public in New York after its initial IPO plan failed due to the hesitation of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

42430179,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMooth,1549987209,Take Two: Ethereum Is Getting Ready for the Constantinople Hard Fork Redo,"If at first you don’t succeed, try try again.  Such are the words of wisdom that have been taken to heart by ethereum core developers ever since a vulnerability in the network's code was discovered just 48 hours before the code was set to be deployed.  The network upgrade dubbed Constantinople would have introduced a series of backward-incompatible changes – also known as a hard fork – to the world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Yet the bug discovered led to a delay, followed by a plan to try once again in late February.  With the code expected to activate sometime during the last week of February – specifically, at block number 7,280,000 – ethereum core developers are confident that Constantinople won’t fail this time around.  “I suspect it will go as planned. The block number has been set and [the upgrade] is hard coded in the clients now so it’s going along fine,” Hudson Jameson, who handles developer relations for the Ethereum Foundation, told CoinDesk.  Adding that “valuable lessons” are learned from every hard fork, Jameson said that one of the important takeaways from last January’s hard fork attempt was ""better communication with miners to let them know about the upgrade.""  While the issue in the code wouldn’t have impacted miners directly, miners and other users who run complete copies of the ethereum blockchain called nodes needed to be swiftly notified about the cancellation of Constantinople to keep it from actually being deployed and creating possible disruptions.  On this front, the smart contract security audit firm ChainSecurity, which discovered the vulnerability, told CoinDesk the organization of ethereum developers was already quite impressive.  “I was just impressed by how quickly everyone reacted and how well organized everyone reacted,"" said CTO Hubert Ritzdorf. ""Many people had to update so they had to know what to update to. On many different levels it became clear even though there is no central command, the [ethereum] community collaborates very efficiently.""  Called Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), four out of five EIPs will actually be activated on the main network, or mainnet. And for all technical purposes, the upgrade will be deployed in two parts – simultaneously.  Say hello to ‘Petersberg’  Developers proposed during a meeting late January to table the EIP temporarily and proceed with the rest of Constantinople as planned, determining that a fix to the buggy EIP – EIP 1283 – would delay activation of ethereum’s planned hard fork for too long.  However, given that several test networks on ethereum including Ropsten already activated Constantinople in its full glory before the security vulnerability was found, ethereum core developers also agreed that a second hard fork safely removing the EIP was needed.  Thus, ""Petersberg"" was born.  Already released on Ropsten, Petersberg is the informal name of the hard fork specifically designed to remove EIP 1283 from a live ethereum-like network. Later this month, the original Constantinople code will be activated on mainnet in conjunction with Petersberg.  “For all practical means for any developer out there on the mainnet, there will not have been Constantinople really, just Petersberg … Technically in the code, you have two conditions,” ChainSecurity COO Matthias Egli explained. “One says Constantinople gets active at block number [7,280,000] and at the same block number Petersberg gets activated, which takes precedence over Constantinople and immediate supersedes it.”  And in terms of what’s left to be done for Petersberg launch on mainnet, Jameson said that all of the testing for its release has been completed and major software clients including Geth and Parity are ready to deploy on the agreed-upon block number.  Now, as emphasized by ethereum security lead Martin Holst Swende, users of ethereum should be aware of important changes to the ethereum network as a result of Constantinople plus Petersberg.  The new ‘corner case’  Tweeting  out a questionnaire for users last Thursday, Swende noted that after Constantinople, smart contracts on ethereum considered to be virtually immutable will be able to change code under certain conditions over the course of multiple transactions.  The new feature introduced through EIP 1014 – called “Skinny CREATE2” – is intended to better facilitate off-chain transactions on ethereum by allowing what Ritzdorf describes as “deterministic deployment.”  “When you deploy a new smart contract on ethereum, what happens is that it computes the address to where the contract will be deployed. You know this ahead of time but it depends on a lot of variables,” Ritzdorf told CoinDesk. “CREATE2 makes it easier to say, ‘We will deploy in the future a contract to this particular address.”  As a result of this, Ritzdorf explains smart contract developers could technically deploy contracts for “the second time” to the same address, noting:  “[After Constantinople] you can change code because you can first deploy to that address, destruct the code and then deploy again.”  Egli highlighted that this is ""not a security bug"" but rather ""a corner case"" that developers on ethereum should be wary of once the changes are going live. He added that continued education from auditors in advance of February’s hard fork is needed about the other four EIPs originally set for inclusion in Constantinople outside of EIP 1283.  Users anticipating the launch of Constantinople can either go to forkmon.ethdevops.io or Ethernodeshttps://ethernodes.org/network/1/forkwatch/overview to watch the release in real time. A number of other sites are also available for live metrics including mining hashrate and market prices.  According to one hard fork countdown timer created by Afri Schoedon, release manager for the Parity Ethereum client, Constantinople plus Petersberg is estimated as of press time to go live on Thursday, February 28.

42430166,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMooTh,1549983610,"Ripple, Barclays Accelerator Back $1.7 Million Round for Remittance Firm","Ripple, Barclays's tech accelerator and other investors have backed a $1.7 million round for SendFriend, a new remittance startup that will use the XRP cryptocurrency to move funds internationally.  Announcing the news on Monday, the New York-based firm said the Mastercard Foundation, MIT Media Lab, Techstars, Mahindra Finance, 2020 Ventures and 8 Decimal Capital also participated in the round. Barclays gained a stake through its ""Barclays, powered by TechStars"" accelerator program, into which SendFriend was accepted last September.  The money raised will go toward hiring staff, as well as focusing on community engagement and marketing, said SendFriend’s co-founder and chief executive officer David Lighton.  SendFriend, which said it was founded at MIT, aims to serve overseas workers from the Philippines, using XRP and Ripple’s xRapid product for cross-border settlements.  The firm explained how it will work, saying:  “XRP is used as a liquidity vehicle for cross-border payments, enabling SendFriend to circumvent the corresponding banking system and convert USD to XRP to PHP [Philippine peso] in a matter of seconds.”  Not yet live, SendFriend said it plans to launch in New Jersey soon, but will also be available in other U.S. states via desktop and mobile apps.  Ripple confirmed that SendFriend will leverage the XRP token in a release last week. Lighton said at the time: “The existing correspondent banking system is slow, inefficient and costly.”  In its funding announcement, SendFriend claimed that it will offer 65 percent lower fees compared to the industry average for international money transfers, as blockchain “replaces the frictions and fees of the banking system.”  Last week, the Philippines’ House of Representatives reportedly approved a bill that seeks to grant overseas Filipino workers a 10–50 percent remittance fee discount depending on the amount being remitted.  The Philippines is one of the largest Asian markets for remittances. Last year, the country’s diaspora sent back home $34 billion, according to a World Bank report from December.  Correction (Feb. 12): Due to an error in the source press release, this article previously did not make clear that Barclays involvement with SendFriend was via its accelerator program Barclays, powered by TechStars.

42430164,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMooRh,1549980025,Blockchain Sleuthing Startup Chainalysis Raises $30 Million,"Chainalysis, the cryptocurrency transaction analysis startup, has raised $30 million in Series B funding.  The firm will use some of the funding to open a new office in London and a research-and-development lab in a bid to expand its presence in the U.K., where it has worked closely with the likes of Barclays, the High Street bank. The funding round suggests that investors are still putting their money into industry businesses despite the prolonged bear market in cryptocurrencies.  The round was led by seasoned VC firm Accel and included additional investments from Benchmark, which led Chainalysis’ $16m Series A last April. Accel’s investment was led by Amit Kumar and Philippe Botteri, and Botteri will represent Accel on Chainalysis’ board of directors.  Michael Gronager, CEO and co-founder of Chainalysis, said the investment demonstrates a continuing appetite to make a long-term bet on the foundations of the emerging crypto ecosystem, telling CoinDesk:  “The investment and the timing of it shows that, despite fluctuating prices, there is quite a strong conviction among some very big VCs that this is not a short term play.”  London calling  Although there are concerns among businesses about Brexit – the U.K.’s pending departure from the European Union – Gronager highlighted the importance of London as a leading fintech hub. Chainalysis currently employs over 100 people and has offices in New York, Washington and Copenhagen.  In addition to opening a new London office, Chainalysis will also explore research partnerships and collaborations with universities in London, which Gronager said are leading the way in some areas of cryptocurrency research.  Asked if that meant University College London (UCL) or Imperial College, he said: “We haven't chosen a side there. So we are happy to work with everyone.”  Chainalysis’ longstanding relationship with Barclays was an important driver early on in the crypto space, helping to establish a bank account for Circle, for example.  Gronager said there is now a growing interest from both mid-tier and top-tier banks to come in and work with crypto companies, such as exchanges (Barclays’ banking relationship with Coinbase is often cited in this regard.)  Although he wouldn’t name names, Gronager said: “There are bigger banks outside of the U.K. that want to enter banking relationships with crypto exchanges, essentially following the same procedure as Barclays.”  Know-your-stablecoin  Having launched real-time AML software Chainalysis KYT (“Know Your Transaction”) last year, the Chainalysis team has now expanded this beyond bitcoin, ether and litecoin to encompass the growing trend for stablecoins, or tokens that are linked in some fashion to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar.  Gronager said that while stablecoins are not problematic in the way that ICO tokens are to regulators, concerns remain over where the stablecoins are moving exactly – and whether there is proper regulatory oversight.  Chainalysis has moved fast to support different stablecoins, said Gronager, so that providers can have proper oversight and show that to regulators, adding,  “The anticipation is this will create a lighter touch on how to regulate these,"" he told CoinDesk.

42430167,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMooPh,1549976434,Oracle's First Dozen Cloud Blockchain Applications Are Now Live,"Despite years of hype and chatter, enterprise blockchain deployments actually in production are few and far between.  But according to Oracle, the list just got a little bigger.  Announced Tuesday, the software giant now has up to a dozen enterprise customers using live applications that have sped into production since its cloud-based blockchain platform went live last July.  This includes a cargo tracking consortium called the Global Shipping Business Network (GSBN); China Distance Education Holdings, which shares educational and professional certificates; Circulor, which tracks conflict minerals; and SERES, a solution for dealing with invoices between franchisors.  Oracle said other customers at the production stage are: Arab Jordan Investment Bank, Certified Origins, NeuroSoft, TradeFin, HealthSync, OriginTrail, ICS FS, SDK.Finance, and Nigeria Customs.  Previously, the only major enterprise blockchains in production were built using IBM Blockchain; namely trade finance solution we.trade and Food Trust (it’s notable that both Oracle and IBM have used Hyperledger Fabric to create their blockchain platforms.)  Frank Xiong, group vice president of blockchain product development at Oracle, told CoinDesk:  “Other vendors may still be experimenting but we do have real customers in live production. I would say around 10 to a dozen are in a live situation.”  By ""in production,"" Xiong said he means these applications have their own end users and are handling live transactions. He said transaction numbers vary from customer to customer, with them all gradually rising.  “To start with we were seeing transactions probably among hundreds an hour. But are expecting many of them to grow to thousands of transactions per second,” said Xiong.  This also depends on the size of your payload, or transmitted data, and the number of peers on the network, he added.  Taking on IBM  The GSBN consortium, which formed last year, includes five ocean carriers (COSCO, CMA CGM, Evergreen Marine, OOCL, and Yang Ming) as well as terminal operators: DP World, Hutchinson Ports, PSA International Pte Ltd, and Shanghai International Port.  As such, it’s a clear competitor to IBM and Maersk’s TradeLens, which also seeks participation from shipping carriers, freight forwarders and port authorities.  Xiong said the GSBN consortium grew out of Oracle's close partnership with CargoSmart, an independent software vendor that put the consortium together. CargoSmart is a subsidiary of OOCL and therefore some way comparable with IBM and Maersk. But he said GSBN works out cheaper.  “As a pricing model, we charge by transactions,"" he said. ""So it becomes a very attractive model for new entrants. Once you are established, the transaction charges are very low at this point.”  Xiong also dispelled any potential confusion over IP ownership, which was seen by some as an obstacle for TradeLens.  ""We own the IP for our platform, the piece we put in there,"" he said. ""CargoSmart develops the application on top and they own the IP on that.” (CargoSmart, which itself was previously known to be an Oracle blockchain customer, did not answer requests for comment by press time.)  Fabric of the future  It’s fine to see Oracle going great guns with Hyperledger Fabric, but one criticism which has been leveled at the vendor is the lack of code it has supplied to the open-source project.  Asked if this was a fair comment, Xiong pointed out that Oracle has been working on Fabric for over a year and contributed a number of bug fixes.  In addition, Oracle worked out certain enhancements around the database, said Xiong, specifically switching out Fabric’s Level DB and using Oracle’s Berkeley DB which, he said, has better performance and richer querying capabilities.  “For these enhanced areas we will make a decision about when we will contribute the interface to the community. I would say definitely yes, we are going in the direction of making more contributions to this OS community.”  And measure for measure, Oracle is open to collaborating with IBM and others when it comes to blockchain, Xiong said.  “We offer a very rich Rest API connection for a Fabric-based blockchain,"" he said. ""So whether you are IBM Bluemix [cloud] developer or other cloud or on-premises – you can be integrated with our platform.”  Oracle image via Shutterstock.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/02/12/oracles-first-dozen-cloud-blockchain-applications-are-now-live,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c782845c4ea980d52063ed8febccf703c77a56d5-1500x936.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The firm's CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted Tuesday that the firm is targeting a date of Feb. 20 for the public testnet release of Binance Chain – the native public blockchain being developed to support the DEX.  Last week, in a 45-minute live ask-me-anything (AMA) chat on Twitter, Zhao provided details of the coming DEX.  He said the firm has already given early access to a few “selected partners,” including wallet developers and blockchain explorers, who will be integrating tools into the decentralized platform. Ledger's hardware wallet, the Nano S, is already integrated, he said, while the Nano X and wallets from Trezor and KeepKey will come on board in the future.  Binance DEX will be available on all platforms, including Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS and Android, as per the AMA.  ""Binance DEX works very similar to bitcoin,"" Zhao explained. ""So most transactions are transparent. There's no hidden transactions or private transactions.""  Further, there will be a listing fee of about $100,000 for tokens listed on Binance DEX – a high entry hurdle that he said was set to reduce the number of “spam or scam projects.""  Teasing the service, Binance released a detailed video of Binance DEX in December. That provided a demo of the trading interface, its web-based crypto wallet and an explorer for Binance Chain.  The firm said at the time that Binance DEX will have a very similar interface to its existing centralized exchange, with some additional features such as an option to generate a 24-word mnemonic seed phrase for users’ private keys.  Binance Chain was unveiled in March 2018, with the firm saying at the time that it is being built to offer “low latency, high throughput trading, as well as decentralized custody of funds.”  The exchange's own token, Binance Coin (BNB), will also play a role in the functioning of the blockchain.  In the AMA, Zhao said:  ""Binance Coin on the Binance Chain is the same as the Ethereum coin on the Ethereum network. You will have to use it to pay for network transactions, as gas.""  Yesterday, BNB extended its recent price gains to set a new all-time high against bitcoin.

42430182,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMoozh,1549970403,Bitcoin Price Pattern Hints at Short-Term Rally to $4K,"View  Bitcoin has backed off 4 percent from three-week highs seen on Friday, but looks to have formed a bull flag – a bullish continuation pattern – on the 4-hour chart.  A move above $3,630 would confirm a flag breakout and open the doors to $4,000 (target as per the measured move method).  Acceptance below the lower edge of the flag, currently at $3,546 would weaken the short-term bullish case. That, however, looks unlikely, as the path of least resistance is to the higher side, according to Friday's high-volume falling wedge breakout.  Bitcoin’s overnight pullback from three-week highs hit on Friday doesn’t mean the rally is over.  The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $3,560 on Bitstamp, having clocked a three-week high of $3,711 on Feb. 8. The 4 percent correction was preceded by repeated failures at the 50-day moving average (MA) resistance, currently at $3,633.  Even so, the prospects of a stronger short-term rally toward $4,000 look strong, as the price pullback has carved out a bull flag on the technical charts. That pattern represents a pause, which often ends up extending the preceding bullish move.  A break above the upper edge of the flag, currently at $3,630, would confirm a breakout and could be followed by a rally to $4,000 (length of the preceding bullish move added to the breakout price).  4-hour chart  BTC's move to highs above $3,700 on Friday confirmed a falling wedge breakout on the 4-hour chart. The short-term outlook, therefore, is bullish. Validating that positive development is a bull cross of the 50- and 100-candle moving averages.  Put simply, the bulls appear to be in control and could soon force a flag breakout.  It's worth noting, though, if the bulls don't act soon, then the flag’s horizontal length (duration) would exceed the pole’s height in the next few hours, deeming the bullish continuation setup invalid. The RSI has also dropped into bearish territory below 50 and the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) is close to turning negative.  So, the bulls need progress soon to stop BTC finding acceptance below flag support at $3,546. That would shift risk in favor of a drop to $3,400.  Daily chart  On the daily chart, the 5- and 10-candle MAs are trending north, indicating a short-term bullish setup.  A bull flag breakout, if confirmed, could yield a convincing move above the 50-candle MA – a level, which has acted as stiff resistance in the last 72 hours.

42430178,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMooph,1549969235,Two Public Pensions Anchor Morgan Creek's New $40 Million Venture Fund,"Two public pension funds are dipping their toes into the world of crypto venture capital.  ""As far as we know, nobody has raised money from a public pension,"" Anthony Pompliano, partner at Morgan Creek Capital, told CoinDesk in an interview.  Morgan Creek  , an asset manager focused on institutional clients and family offices, announced Tuesday a new crypto-focused venture fund with $40 million invested. The two public pensions anchoring the fund are Fairfax County, Virginia's Police Officer's Retirement System and Employees' Retirement System.  Speaking to the conservative bent of those involved, the new fund's investors also include a university endowment, a hospital system, an insurance company and a private foundation.  “Blockchain technology is being applied in unique and compelling ways across multiple industries,"" Katherine Molnar, the chief investment officer of the Fairfax County Police Officer's Retirement System, said in a press release. ""We feel it is important to be opportunistic and are excited to participate in this emerging opportunity, due to the attractive asymmetric return profile that it represents.""  As of their most recent financial statements, the police pension fund has $1.45 billion in assets, while the fund for Fairfax government employees has $4.25 billion. While both come from the same geographic area, they are separate funds with separate investment committees, Pompliano noted.  The size of the two funds helps to illuminate the potential of bringing public pensions into blockchain investing. Such entities can take large positions in crypto funds using a very small portion of their assets under management.  We've previously seen major pension funds discuss crypto as an alternative investment strategy. Most notably, the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) considered it as far back as 2016. In fact, a retirement system in Ontario, Canada, took part in an investment in decentralized marketplace Open Bazaar through its own VC firm.  Still, this is very early days for pension funds picking up opportunities focused on cryptocurrency.  Selling pensions on crypto  Morgan Creek's new fund will primarily make seed investments in equity, Pompliano explained, though in certain limited cases it will also invest in token-based projects that don't create equity opportunities but do have cash flow. It will also hold a small amount of key cryptocurrencies.  Public pensions face an uphill battle meeting their obligations over the coming years, Pompliano said, finding that such organizations are looking to diversify beyond traditional stocks and bonds. That's how the Morgan Creek team pitched taking a small position in the blockchain industry.  ""The belief is this gives them great exposure to what we believe are some of the best risk-mitigated opportunities in a nascent industry,"" Pompliano said.  The fund has already closed deals in some of the most established names in crypto, including Coinbase, Bakkt, BlockFi, TrustToken, Harbor and Good Money, among others.  ""You can take a small amount of capital, you can put it in a nascent industry, you can manage your risk correctly but also get exposure to true innovation,"" Pompliano explained.  Morgan Creek's new fund will primarily seek opportunities in equity, but it's open to some small number of security token opportunities that provide cash flow, so long as they fall under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's regulation D, which allows a smaller company to sells securities that are exempt from the larger filing requirements of a traditional public offering.

42430175,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMoonh,1549965605,Bithumb Kicks Off Middle East Expansion With UAE Crypto Exchange,"South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb is planting its flag in the Middle East with the launch of a licensed fiat-to-crypto exchange in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  The firm announced Tuesday that it has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the UAE-based firm Nvelop to form a joint venture for the initiative, CoinDesk Korea reports.  Nvelop was founded by Abu Dhabi-based E11 Investment Fund and Asia-based venture capital firm Trill Ventures Group to fund blockchain businesses in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.  Through the new partnership, Bithumb said, the company plans to further expand in MENA nations, including states such as Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.  Back in June, Abu Dhabi’s markets regulator, the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of the Abu Dhabi Global Market issued a regulatory framework under which crypto exchanges must be licensed and approved by the FSRA as crypto-asset businesses. The framework also limits the types of crypto assets that can be used by firms.  The FSRA plans to issue crypto licenses under the scheme from the first half of this year, Bithumb said in today’s announcement. If approved, this means its UAE-based exchange could launch around mid-2019.  Just last week, Bithumb launched a global over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk for digital assets through its Hong Kong-based entity, Bithumb Global.  Bithumb is also seeking to go public in the U.S. through a reverse merger deal. In January, the firm signed a binding letter-of-intent agreement with Blockchain Industries, an investment firm focusing on the crypto and blockchain industry and traded on the U.S OTC markets.  Once the deal is complete, the combined entity would be known as Blockchain Exchange Alliance (BXA), and could potentially become the first U.S.-listed crypto exchange. The firms aim to complete the deal by March 1.  Bithumb was notably hacked for around $30 million back in June 2018, but claimed to have clawed back almost half that amount soon after with assistance from other exchanges. After several months rebuilding its security systems, the firm relaunched user registrations last August.

In his inaugural speech in Hong Kong on Feb. 10, Randal K. Quarles, who also serves as the vice chair for supervision at the U.S. Federal Reserve Board of Governors, said the FSB will start reviewing its framework to ensure it's ""at the cutting edge of financial stability vulnerability assessment.""  Quarles further noted that while such review process is aimed to improve the agency's ability to recommend better financial stability policies for the G20 nations, a well-rounded framework might just be difficult to accomplish, given the evolving developments of new technologies such as cryptocurrency.  He said:  ""This will not be easy – developments like the emergence of crypto-assets may challenge any framework – but that makes the goal of a robust framework all the more important.""  The FSB was set up in 2009 in the aftermath of the global financial crisis in a bid to provide financial vulnerability assessment for the G20. Quarles was appointed as the new chair on Nov. 28, taking on the role previously held by Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England.  While Quarles did not specify what scale this framework review process will be, it's notable that the FSB already proposed a framework in July last year specifically for ""vigilantly"" monitoring the risks of cryptocurrency with metrics looking at price volatility, the growth of initial coin offerings and crypto's use in global payments.  The review will be undertaken by a FSB committee headed by its vice chair Klaas Knot, who is also president of the Dutch National Bank, the central bank of the Netherlands.
