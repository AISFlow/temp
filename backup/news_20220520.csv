In addition, at the end of 2019, well-known nonprofits/fundraising platforms such as UNICEF began accepting cryptocurrencies. &apos;Save the Children&apos; is a well-known charitable organization founded in 2013. Given this, it is unavoidable that most non-profits will accept cryptocurrency donations in the future. However, many fundraising platforms are still hesitant to accept cryptocurrency donations. One of the most common reasons is that this currency appears difficult to comprehend. However, if you know what to do, you can make the transition smooth and painless for your donors.

Donation methods such as direct mail campaigns are less popular than they once were, but e-donation (electronic donation) is growing in popularity.

42421154,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXasAf,1653084632,Justin Sun Still Thinks Algorithmic Stablecoins Are a Good Idea,"Justin Sun, founder of the Tron blockchain and Grenada’s ambassador to the World Trade Organization, said that, if anything, the collapse of UST and LUNA was a good lesson in what not to do when building an algorithmic stablecoin.  Before it collapsed, the combined value of Terra’s twinned assets was about $40 billion. Founded in 2018, the blockchain only really got going in the last year of the recent crypto bull market. A suite of apps, and a boisterous founder, attracted both retail and institutional attention. And that meteoric growth may have been its undoing.  “If I was Do Kwon I would’ve taken care of the situation in a much more careful way,” Sun said Friday, referring to Terra’s founder, on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover.” That may be easier said than done.  Just three days before Terra collapsed, Tron launched its own algorithmic stablecoin, USDD.  It’s still unknown what exactly catalyzed Terra’s demise. Some in that blockchain’s community pushed a conspiracy theory that institutions including BlackRock (BLK) and Citadel Securities forced liquidations by exploiting a known flaw in the network’s design. Others think the blockchain just couldn’t handle the stress because all risk assets pulled back because of a looming economic recession.  Read more: Citadel Securities, BlackRock, Gemini Slam Social Media Accusations of Involvement With UST Collapse  Sun, not always known for his sober takes or rational behavior, was a little more realistic. He said whatever the impetus, Terra’s collapse was preceded by a major move of capital on the network after Terraform Labs began to withdraw UST from a liquidity pool on decentralized stablecoin exchange Curve.  Terra’s leadership removed liquidity from a stablecoin swap called 3pool in anticipation of its own dedicated tool meant to improve UST markets, called 4pool. Whatever happened next, Sun said the timing was perfect for anyone wanting to launch an attack on Terra.  “Nobody [could] defend the price or the peg,” he said, referring to the mechanism that keeps UST artificially pegged to the U.S. dollar.  Sun may be versed with the technicalities of UST’s collapse, considering some experts have noticed the similarities between Tron’s USDD and Terra’s UST. He said he planned to launch the USDD stablecoin project three months ago, and is thankful for the learning experience of UST’s “dramatic” end.  That said, Sun remains concerned that USDD could be attacked by short sellers or face a similar fate to that of UST.  Terra cannot undo the damage it caused, though current and future algorithmic stablecoins need to focus on “organic growth.” They must also be provably decentralized, and likely need to live on multiple blockchains, he said.  Tron, which offers ultra-low fees to move money, is home to many users of the centralized stablecoin tether (USDT). Criticized in the past for its lack of transparency, Sun said that he believes Tether, the organization that manages the eponymous stablecoin, maintains complete reserves.  “I would like to encourage Tether to have an even more transparent way to communicate with the crypto community,” he said.  Still in its early stages, Sun said USDD “is very safe.” At the very least, its $348 million market capitalization means if it collapsed it wouldn’t cause cascading problems across the crypto markets as UST did. Sun, characteristically braggadocious, said he’s eyeing a $2 billion valuation for the coin.  Read more: Justin Sun Talks USDD Stablecoin in Wake of LUNA/UST Unravel  “We need to be more careful,” he added. Although they’ve been proven risky, he’s still a complete supporter of algorithmic stablecoins, which might be the easiest way to create a proxy dollar asset that is truly untethered from regulation.  “These days, stablecoins are the most centralized part of this decentralized world,” he said, adding the centralized options’ “fate is decided by the regulators around the globe.”  Taking a more lighthearted line, Sun said Terra’s developers should turn the now-valueless UST and LUNA tokens into meme coins like “SHIBA or a DOGE coin.”  “It’s the only way to solve this problem,” he said.

42395386,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASwMiy,1653080358,Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes Sentenced to 2 Years Probation,"Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes was sentenced to two years of probation, with home detention for six months and location monitoring, in a federal courthouse in New York on Friday. Hayes had pleaded guilty in February to charges he willfully failed to implement an anti-money laundering (AML) program at the exchange.  Hayes, a longtime resident of Singapore, will be allowed 30 days to decide where in the U.S. he will serve his home detention. After living in Asia for 14 years, Hayes recently bought a home in Miami, but his lawyer said Friday he has no community in Florida and might wish to do his home detention elsewhere.  Read more: BitMEX Starts Spot Exchange on Eve of Co-Founder Hayes's Sentencing  With over two dozen friends and family members in the courtroom behind him, including his wife, his mother and his brother, Hayes told the judge he took “full responsibility” for his actions.  “I deeply regret that I had a part in this criminal activity,” Hayes said. “My best years are ahead of me. … I am ready to turn the page and start again. I ask that you allow me to return home, deeply remorseful and able to start the next chapter of my life.”  Judge John Koeltl of the U.S. Southern District Court in New York agreed that Hayes would be able to travel internationally after successfully completing his period of home detention, checking in with his probation officer as necessary via video call from his home in Asia.  Hayes’s sentencing came as somewhat of a surprise. A plea deal Hayes made with the government earlier this year outlined a sentencing guideline of six to 12 months in prison. The charges he faced carried a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.  But because Hayes was a first-time offender with a long track record of charitable work, the Probation Department recommended a period of two years probation with no incarceration.  In a sentencing memo submitted on May 12, prosecutors rejected the Probation Department’s recommendation and urged Judge Koeltl to hand down a sentence above the six- to 12-month sentence stipulated in the plea deal.  Judge Koeltl declined to do so, arguing that the court should treat Hayes as an individual, not as an example for other off-shore exchanges.  Hayes will also be allowed to continue communicating with BitMEX co-founders Samuel Reed and Ben Delo, who both pleaded guilty. Standard probation guidelines bar felons from communicating with other known felons, but Judge Koeltl agreed to make an exception for Hayes and his co-founders.  Hayes, Reed, and Delo – as well as the company’s first employee, Gregory Dwyer – were initially charged in October 2020 with one count each of violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), and another of conspiring to do so.  Dwyer has pleaded not guilty to the charges. A trial is slated for later this year.

That could reflect uncertainty among crypto traders.  BTC was down by 3% over the past 24 hours and is roughly flat over the past week. Meanwhile, several alternative cryptos (altcoins) underperformed on Friday. For example, Solana's SOL token was down by 5%, and Avalanche's AVAX token was down by 4% over the past 24 hours.  Just launched! Please sign up for our daily Market Wrap newsletter explaining what happens in crypto markets – and why.  On Friday, the S&P 500 briefly fell into bear market territory, declining by more than 20% from its record high in January. Volatility remains elevated in both stocks and cryptos, while gold, a traditional safe haven asset, ticked higher on Friday.  On the macroeconomic front, some analysts expect selling pressure to wane in stocks, which could benefit cryptos short term. Bitcoin has been increasingly correlated with the S&P 500 over the past year.  ""It is premature to worry about an approaching recession until the bond market and central banks push monetary conditions into restrictive territory, which we do not expect in 2022,"" MRB Partners wrote in a Friday email. The firm expects a window of opportunity for equity markets to rebound as global growth conditions prove resilient, assuming interest rate expectations and bond yields calm down soon.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  DeFi underperforms  Decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens have underperformed bitcoin over the past month. Typically, DeFi and other altcoins underperform in a down market because of their higher risk profile relative to bitcoin.  The CoinDesk DeFi Index (DFX) is down by 33% over the past month, compared with a 23% decline in the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) over the same period.  Over the past week, however, DFX has stabilized. Recent gains in AAVE have helped, while a 17% drop in CRV token has detracted from the overall index's performance over the past week.

ZRX crypto is up 24 percent at press time versus the USDT, outperforming BTC and ETH during the same period. As per the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, ZRXUSDT is in a retest phase though the primary trend remains southwards. Ox Protocol Technical Analysis From a top-down analysis, the ZRX coin is bearish. Specifically, it is within a bear breakout formation with resistance at $0.50 flashing with May 11 highs. Following the resurgence of ZRX crypto prices buoyed by rising trading volumes, traders may search for entries targeting April 2022 lows of around $0.65. Of note, the May 20 bull bar is with decent trading volumes printing after encouraging sideways movement. The surge of ZRXUSDT crypto prices may unwind the losses of May 11. In that case, ZRX coin bulls would have the upper hand from an effort versus results perspective. On a more cautious outlook, deeper losses below $0.36 may trigger more dumps towards 2022 lows of around $0.30. What to Expect from ZRX? Buyers are on the front foot when writing.

The &apos;net unrealized profit and loss,&apos; or NUPL in brief, is an indicator that&apos;s defined as the difference between the current Bitcoin market cap and its realized cap, divided by the market cap.

Well, we don&apos;t know for sure. However, the main reason for this uncertainty is that it is unknown how many Ethereum will be required to stake to become a validator. Besides, if the amount is too high, only a few large ETH holders will have a chance to qualify as validators. In turn, this would lead to more centralization. Conversely, if the amount required is low, many individuals or organizations could potentially serve as validators. Consequently, centralization would decrease. Ultimately, the amount of ETH required to stake will likely play a prominent role. It will strongly influence how centralized or decentralized a PoS Ethereum will be. Time will tell whether a Proof-of-Stake Ethereum will see further centralization or not. Until then, we can only speculate. Is centralization helping in the running of Ethereum? There is no definitive answer to this question. Some people believe that centralization can help improve the efficiency of Ethereum. Others believe that decentralization is necessary to keep Ethereum secure. Ultimately, it is up to individual beliefs. There are pros and cons to both centralization and decentralization.

42395387,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASwMhz,1653071144,First a Hum and Then a Bang: Niagara Falls Residents Forced to Reckon With Crypto Mining,"NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. — An explosion and subsequent fire rocked a Blockfusion crypto mining facility in upstate New York last week, resulting in thousands of mining rigs going offline.  About three miles away, another bitcoin mine owned by U.S. Bitcoin Corp. had previously drawn the ire of some residents for being too noisy.  The result: In December, the city of Niagara Falls imposed a 180-day moratorium on new bitcoin mining operations while it works on ordinances to control impact of mining on the local community.  The new laws will likely include zoning requirements to ensure crypto mines aren't too close to residential areas, Niagara Falls Mayor Robert Restaino told CoinDesk in a phone interview on Thursday. ""We have what we think is the final draft of the proposed change,"" the mayor said. As for next steps, he said the draft will go to the city planning board before it goes to the city council for a final vote.  Most residents near the Blockfusion site told CoinDesk they had heard the explosion but weren't too alarmed at the time, and said the resulting fire was put out quickly. Teresa Chapelle, who lives about one-third of a mile away, said she not only heard, but also felt, the explosion inside her home.  At the time she was having dinner with her children in her yard – which has a direct view of the Blockfusion facility about 400 yards away – Marlene Maikranz said the explosion was terrifying to her and her kids, and she rushed them inside to avoid inhaling the fumes. These kinds of explosions, though, were actually a more common occurrence several years ago when the site was still operating as a power plant, she said.  Maikranz posted photos from the incident on her personal Facebook page, which indicate the date of the explosion as May 10.  Blockfusion USA is a New York City-based company, and the mining rigs it hosts at the Niagara Falls site belong to Nasdaq-listed Bit Digital (BTBT), which reported the incident in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday.  Bit Digital noted that power was cut off for 2,515 bitcoin miners and 710 ethereum miners, but the explosion and fire didn't seriously damage the machines or the building.  The company placed blame for the explosion with ""faulty equipment owned by the power utility,"" and said it intends – along with Blockfusion – to ""pursue claims including seeking reimbursement for lost revenue.""  ""How this gets resolved between the utility and its customer, I think will be the subject of an awful lot of discussion,"" Restaino said, adding that the fire department wasn't called for an investigation on the site and simply responded to the incident. The police department wasn't involved, the mayor's office said.  The city's biggest concern, Restaino said, is that such facilities operate in line with local law, particularly with regard to electrical services and permitting. ""That's really been the failure on the part of many of these [crypto miners],"" he said.

42421150,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXas6X,1653063082,Dai Creator Rune Christensen on Terra's Collapse,"The founder of one so-called decentralized stablecoin thinks Terra’s collapse is a wake-up call for anyone who hasn’t already seen the inherent risks in another kind of stablecoins – uncollateralized, algorithmic stablecoins.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Rune Christensen, a Danish entrepreneur who founded MakerDAO, also said the crypto industry should enforce strict standards for stablecoins – like collateral requirements – to prevent another financial crisis like the implosion of UST, which erased $40 billion of the coin’s value in less than a week.  It might be convenient for Christensen to say that. His stablecoin platform, which went live in 2014, and which is now overseen by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), has always required that users put up real capital if they want to mint its token, dai, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar.  “The natural end point is that algorithmic stablecoins are … collateralized, because that’s the only way you can protect your users,” Christensen said Thursday on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover.”  Read more: UST Won't Be the End of Algorithmic Stablecoins | The Node  MakerDAO was the first Ethereum-based tool that allowed anyone to mint dollar proxies by collateralizing their crypto. For every dai in circulation, there is roughly double the amount of crypto held in reserve.  Terra, on the other hand, tried a different model. Instead of holding assets in reserve, it used an algorithm and a related free-floating cryptocurrency called LUNA to try to keep its synthetic dollar asset, UST, in line. Like all other “algorithmic stablecoins,” UST met a catastrophic end.  Christensen said it was obvious for others in the community that Terra would collapse long before it did.  “It was completely clear and sort of common knowledge that this model just didn’t work,” Christensen said.  That didn’t stop Terra’s founder Do Kwon from attacking Maker and its stablecoin, at one point even making the grand claim that “By my hand $DAI will die.” About a month after he made that statement, at about the pinnacle of Terra’s success, Kwon’s network entered its fated “death spiral.”  Boom and bust  According to Christensen, Terra functioned like a Ponzi scheme. It was a project that benefited from prices shooting up, mass speculation and Kwon's braggadocio. Eventually, all massive booms must bust.  ""The people in the community that were subjected to this have created some kind of community bond and intangible value that goes beyond the economics of the system,"" he said.  Christensen said that although he was expecting Terra to collapse, he was devastated when it actually happened.  “I wasn’t exactly in the mood to say ‘I told you so.’ It was a human tragedy,” he said.  The fault clearly lies with Terra and its managers, primarily the bombastic Kwon. Terra’s leadership hid risks and built products meant to intentionally lure in investors, like the Anchor Protocol, which offered an unsustainable 20% return on UST holdings.  “They were using services that were giving them a high return and then was hiding the fact of where they were getting that from,” Christensen said.  Terra’s collapse may have a prolonged fallout, and users may become concerned about investing in any stablecoin backed by volatile assets – like dai.  In dai’s case, the currency is overcollateralized, directly backed by ether (ETH), USD coin (USDC) and other cryptocurrencies.  “Nobody needs to trust anybody. You can check for yourself that all the collateral is there,” he said, noting the advantages of the blockchain.  Other stablecoins managed by corporate entities, like USDC, offer transparency through regular disclosures and may appear to be a simpler choice. He also said that tether, a controversial centralized stablecoin, is “probably sound.”  A new proposal to fork the Terra blockchain to try a different approach including adding collateral and other fail safes may point to a bigger message about community resiliency and bonding, but the sentiment may be a little too late.  Read more: The Fall of Terra: A Timeline of the Meteoric Rise and Crash of UST and LUNA  “There’s a risk it isn’t going to work because … of political fracturing,” Christensen said. He added that a plan to redistribute Terra’s remaining treasury assets to small holders has been fraught with indecision and mismanagement.  “No matter what the community attempts to do, the main objective should be to reimburse the UST holders,” he said. He added that some so-called lunatics may suffer from a “sort of Stockholm Syndrome,” but that may itself point to the “inherent resilience and value of decentralized communities.”  None of this is to say algorithmic stablecoins are dead. But a safer option might be to treat them a little bit more like traditional financial assets. When it comes to regulating algorithmic stablecoins, Christensen could eventually see a point when issuers must meet a threshold collateral requirement, like banks.

42411463,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glO4wo,1653062228,There Was No Terra ‘Attack’,"Happy Friday, readers. David Z. Morris here, filling in for Michael Casey.  For the past six weeks, I’ve had an eagle eye on the terraUST (UST) algorithmic stablecoin system, first writing about why it would collapse, then watching as it did exactly that. The human tragedy has been immense, and while Terra creator Do Kwon and his supporters may want to label the disaster a mere speed-bump on the way to success, a spate of civil and criminal proceedings suggest that many suspect it constituted fraud. That line between fraud and failure has become increasingly fine, inviting comparisons between Kwon and Theranos’ Elizabeth Holmes.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here. Michael Casey is away.  But today I want to focus on the other side of the equation. I’ve seen repeated references to the idea that UST lost its peg because of an “attack,” a “coordinated attack” and even “a hit job.” This framing often comes from those trying to defend UST’s fundamental soundness, despite many years’ worth of warnings that algorithmic stablecoins are doomed to fail.  It is likely true that the depegging of UST was at least partly the result of an “attack,” in the sense that capital was deployed strategically and in large amounts to bring down the Terra peg. But there is a troubling misdirection just beneath that material level. You can see hints of it in references to the hypothetical attackers as immoral or as “more malicious than Do Kwon” himself. It manifests just slightly differently in unfounded (and irresponsible) rumors that a huge hedge fund company like BlackRock (BLK) or Citadel was behind the attack.  The subtext of these defensive tics is something like this: “The collapse of UST wasn’t a real failure because the big banks and Wall Street hate crypto and they sabotaged us because they hate us.”  If you’ve spent a lot of time thinking about financial markets, this line of thinking is so foreign that it’s not easy to pinpoint all the ways in which it’s wrong. So I was naturally furious and humbled to come across a single tweet from an obscure, anonymous account that nailed the logical flaws better than I could.  “There was no attack,” user @pitchbend wrote in part. “If the design is flawed it deserves to collapse the sooner the better. What you call an attack was [a] stress test. And Terra failed it.”  It’s just business  It’s hard to be more correct. To expand on @pitchbend’s bullseye shot, the thing about markets is they don’t have any morality. To paraphrase New York University professor of marketing Scott Galloway, they have no mercy – but also no malice. The person trading against you doesn’t care who you are, just what your position is.  There are exceptions, as when activist investors Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman engaged in a very personal war over Herbalife, a maker of nutritional supplements. But, generally, the only “attackers” in finance are people who see an opportunity to profit from someone else’s mistake. They don’t care if they’re shorting a diamond mine staffed by Congolese child labor or an investment fund for widows and orphans. If they smell money, they strike.  Read more: David Z. Morris - Let Terra Die  To draw the most obvious parallel to the Terra collapse, billionaire investor George Soros didn’t attack the English pound in 1992 because he hated the United Kingdom. That certainly might have been how he felt, I have no idea, but it doesn’t matter. Because it still wouldn’t have had anything to do with his assessment of the financial condition of the pound, the profit potential of shorting it and his likelihood of victory.  In the case of Terra, the profit potential was huge. The definitive numbers are still emerging, but one detailed analysis estimated $800 million in profit from the play. You don’t have to hate crypto, Terra, or Do Kwon personally to pursue that kind of money.  That number is also roughly on par with the $682.5 million Jump Trading was estimated to have spent defending the UST peg, according to The Block’s research director, Igor Igamberdiev (though the numbers aren’t neatly related). That spending also puts the lie to the idea of a shadowy conspiracy of malicious attackers: If there was something underhanded about the attack on the peg, something that broke the rules of the market, why was Jump using market mechanisms to defend it?  Crypto meets reality. Reality wins  I see a couple of takeaways here. The first is a reminder of just how poorly many people who are now speculating in crypto understand financial markets. This has always been a troubling background issue for crypto: those of watching closely know just how experimental this technology and ecosystem are, and how often even well-regarded projects fail or peter out.  There’s a natural impulse to want to protect people who might not understand those risks. At the same time, a major promise of crypto was opening up capital markets to people who wouldn’t qualify to contribute to a traditional VC fund. That openness has helped make a lot of early crypto investors wealthy, and they have, in turn, funded startups and projects that expanded the ecosystem further. That wouldn’t be possible with the same kind of controls in place in equity markets. I don’t know if there’s any way to cut that baby in half, and I’ve spent an awful lot of time thinking about it.  The second takeaway is equally complicated. Though rumors about BlackRock and Citadel are just that, it does seem very plausible that some large mainstream hedge fund was involved in the Terra depeg. That would be a major double-edged sword. On the one hand, it would mean crypto is regarded as a robust and trustworthy enough ecosystem that mainstream finance is willing to risk shorting it. The emergence of more such shorts would, furthermore, benefit the ecosystem long-term by providing a profit motive for asking hard questions about projects.  But at the same time it could mark the end of what will in retrospect seem like a decade of blissful innocence in crypto. Mainstream finance has been happy to collect trading fees on crypto and invest in startups. But when serious traders backed by big piles of money start looking for ways to profit by eating crypto’s weak and frail, they may find a target-rich environment.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,David Z.

40535,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=236605,1653060607,Stablecoins: Still a Bridge Between Cash and Digital?,"Cryptocurrencies have always played a crucial role in bridging cash-based markets with the digital economy. In established and emerging markets, the success of digital services and products depends on how easy it is to switch from cash to digital money. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have been doing an excellent job of serving as a bridge between the two. Cryptocurrencies are volatile, and they lack clear regulations. Regulatory bodies frequently issue warnings on the usage of these coins. These few points create hesitance in individuals to use cryptocurrencies as cash replacements. Stablecoins provide a solution to this problem. Bringing Cryptocurrency and Fiat Together The popularity of cryptocurrencies is growing in emerging markets. Stablecoins are crucial for converting cash into digital currency without dealing with the volatility associated with crypto assets. In their most basic form, stablecoins are also just cryptocurrencies. However, their prices are remarkably stable. The value of these bonds depends on the value of a reference currency, which is typically the US dollar. Tether, the most popular and widely used stablecoin, always has a price based on around one USD. Another example of a stable coin is UST, which suffered a devastating crash not long ago. According to CoinMarketCap, hundreds of stablecoins are in circulation, and their combined market value is around $160 billion.

42395384,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASwMf2,1653056420,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Heads for Record 8-Week Losing Streak,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Brad Keoun, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights. (Lyllah Ledesma is off this week.)  Price point: Bitcoin has so far avoided a steeper tumble below the $30,000 level, but it's still poised to extend its losing streak to a record eight weeks.  Market Moves: Data from the bitcoin options market shows traders are leaning bearish, Shaurya Malwa reports.  Feature: The collapse in LUNA tokens were only part of the story. Crypto traders are rushing for the exits from DeFi apps on the Terra blockchain, Malwa reports.  Price Point  By one measure, cryptocurrency markets are going through their worst-ever stretch – and it's not over yet.  Bitcoin (BTC) has slid 3.2% since Sunday, poised to extend an already-at-a-record seven-week losing sreak.  It's notable the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has showed resilience around the $30,000 price level. But it sure hasn't staged much of a recovery since last week's full-blown sell-off in the wake of the stunning collapse of the Terra blockchain and its LUNA token.  Bitcoin at one point fell to nearly $24,000 but as of press time was changing hands around $30,300. There hasn't been much relief on the economic front, where growing concerns over a U.S. recession are colliding with a Federal Reserve that says it's determined to tamp down fast-rising inflation even as U.S. stocks appear poised to enter a bear market.  The cryptocurrency's correlation with stocks has strengthened recently – partly because so many traditional investors are now trading it – so bitcoin is likely to face ongoing pressure from any tightening of financial conditions.  For what it's worth, the Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs (GS) put out a report predicting that the recent plunge in cryptocurrency prices won't in and of itself create much of a drag on the economy.  Even so, regulators are showing greater concern about the growing risks from crypto. A statement released by the G-7 called for tougher rules to counter money laundering and disclose reserves, after the collapse of stablecoin terraUSD last week, CoinDesk's Jack Schickler reported Friday.  In traditional markets, U.S. stock futures pointed to gains when the market opens on Friday, after China cut a key lending rate – a form of economic stimulus.  Market Moves  By Shaurya Malwa  Activity on bitcoin (BTC) options suggests rising bearish sentiment among investors.  The asset’s price movements have been highly correlated to the U.S. markets in the past few months, with poor earnings reports and hawkish comments from the Federal Reserve showing an impact on bitcoin prices. Investors are placing bets accordingly.  Put/call ratios for bitcoin open interest hit a 12-month high of 0.72 Thursday, research firm Delphi said in a note Friday, adding that the data indicated “bearish sentiment among investors.” Similar ratio levels were reached last May. (A put option is, generally speaking, a bet on a price decline, while a call option is a bet on upside.)  “The put/call ratio measures the amount of put buying relative to calls,” Delphi analysts explained in the note. “A high put/call ratio indicates that investors are speculating whether bitcoin will continue to sell off, or it could mean investors are hedging their portfolios against a downward move.”  “Last April, the put/call ratio traded as high as 0.96 before Bitcoin’s price dropped over 50% in May 2021,” the firm added.

UK Regulator to Consider Terra Coins Collapse in New Crypto Rules: Report Market instability in stablecoins will need to be taken into account, the FCA's executive director for markets said.  Bitcoin Options Data Suggests Bearish Sentiment Among Investors Put/call ratio for bitcoin options reached yearly highs on Thursday, data shows.  Feature: It’s Not Just LUNA. Terra’s DeFi Apps Have Hemorrhaged $28B  By Shaurya Malwa  In the two weeks since Terra's U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin terraUSD (UST) lost its peg, causing massive investor losses, billions of dollars have been taken out of the ecosystem.  Data from trackers show funds held in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications built on Terra have slumped to $155 million in locked value as of Friday morning, a level last seen in February 2021, from more than $29 billion at the start of this month. Locked value on Terra DeFi peaked at $30 billion in early April.  The declines came as UST lost its 1:1 peg against the U.S. dollar amid a broader slump in markets. That created a death spiral as investors exchanged UST for other stablecoins, sending the LUNA token to as low as 4 cents on May 14.  “Experiencing significant losses, or seeing others take significant losses – at no fault of their own – is probably one of the fastest ways for a protocol or blockchain in this space to lose the trust of the community,” Simon Furlong, co-founder of Geode Finance, told CoinDesk in an email.

Singapore-based iZUMi Finance offers liquidity services, or the conversion of one asset into either cash or another asset. The platform is deployed on the Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon and Arbitrum blockchains and has about $58 million in total value locked (TVL), according to DefiLlama data.  Along with the funding, iZUMi announced its new iZiSwap decentralized exchange (DEX), which employs a novel automated market maker (AMM) protocol and the iUSD token.  ""Liquidity is the catalyst for growth in DeFi. With the launch of our Discretized-Liquidity AMM and iUSD, iZUMi Finance is eliminating the barriers to liquidity and making DeFi more attractive and efficient for market participants,"" iZUMi co-founder Jimmy Yin said in a press release.  Funding  The iUSD token is 1:1 pegged to the U.S. dollar, akin to a stablecoin, and it's backed by iZUMi’s collateral and future revenue. IZUMi issues and sells iUSD to private investors.  The new funding included $20 million from institutional investors Ivy Ventures, Cobo and Mirana, among others. More than half of that total came from a voucher sale on the bond-focused Solv Protocol. iZUMi also sold $4 million BUSD worth of the vouchers and an additional 5,000 in BNB, which is equivalent to about $2 million.  Decentralized exchange  The new iZiSwap exchange is built around a so-called ""discretized-liquidity"" AMM. An AMM is simply the protocol that powers a DEX. The discretized liquidity part is more complicated.  The DLAMM model optimizes the price ranges and amount of liquidity for the providers. The end result is a lack of slippage, or difference between the expected price and the executed price in a transaction.  “Let’s say you go to a bank and transfer your USD into GBP. You can’t always get the exact amount of equivalent GBP because there’s transaction fees from the bank and fluctuating exchange rates,” Yin told CoinDesk over Telegram. “DeFi solves the transaction fee part by lowering it significantly compared to banks, and we take good care of the part where the exchange rate will be as favorable to you as possible.”",POSITIVE,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | TRADING | BNB,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/20/defi-protocol-izumi-finance-raises-30m-launches-exchange,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42393825,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBbh3,1653053760,BIP 119: Unpacking CTV and How It Would Change Bitcoin,"When you send a Bitcoin transaction currently, it goes a little something like this: You acquire an address from your recipient, you pick out which unspent transaction outputs (or UTXOs, what the cool folks call “coins”) you want to send, and you sign a transaction with your private key that proves you authorized the spend.  On-chain transactions more or less all work this way, except for special transactions that use Bitcoin’s scripting mechanism. With these transactions, users can utilize a special field to encode instructions for what happens to the coins in that transaction (timelocks are the classic example).  Right now, we can only use Bitcoin scripts to designate when or why a bitcoin is spent. But what if we could use them to designate how a bitcoin is spent? What if, for instance, we could tell a transaction to only spend a certain amount of bitcoin (BTC), or specify that a transaction can only send to a specific address?  Enter OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY (or CTV for short), a proposed Bitcoin upgrade which would introduce new scripting logic for how a transaction can spend specific coin(s).  This modularity could, among other things, improve wallet security because in the event of a hack, the attacker can only send the bitcoin to an address that you control.  Beyond security implications, CTV could also enable financial applications to be more easily deployed on Bitcoin, such as on-chain bitcoin options, using smart contracts, like discreet log contracts (DLCs).  Read more: Discreet Log Contracts Are Bringing Private, ‘Scriptless’ Smart Contracts to Bitcoin  Additionally, CTV could pave the way for “payment pools” and “channel factories,” Lightning Network applications that could be beneficial to custodians, exchanges and Lightning service providers. These payment pools are off-chain, so they could also furnish users with better privacy, as well.  All of these use cases, though, don’t guarantee that it’ll be Bitcoin’s next big upgrade.  Enter BIP 119 and OP_CTV  Currently, bitcoin transactions go from point A to point B – or more accurately, they are locked up by user A until this user gives user B the ability to unlock them. Right now, we can only set a timelock for these coins.  “What could be useful under certain circumstances is that you might want to leave an instruction [for how your bitcoin is spent],” Jeremy Rubin told CoinDesk.  Rubin is the author of Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 119 (BIP 119); these BIPs are a way for Bitcoin contributors (professional and amateur coders alike) to propose changes to Bitcoin’s code for review by the wider community. (Anyone can view these proposals, make their own and comment on BIPs via the Bitcoin Core GitHub.)  Read more: What Are BIPs and Why Do They Matter?  In BIP 119, Rubin introduces OP_Check_Template_Verify (CTV), a proposed upgrade to Bitcoin which creates new spending conditions that allow the receiver – not the sender – to set conditions for how a coin is spent.  If that doesn’t make sense right now, it will later. The important thing to note is that these new conditions could strengthen cold storage and create more private and scalable multiparty transactions and enable a slew of other applications that are generally marketed as bringing “smart contract” compatibility to Bitcoin (via discreet log contracts (DLCs), for one example).  “In the current Bitcoin locks, everything is limited to things like combination locks … with CTV, you get to do things with a little bit of statefulness, which allows you to say a little bit of what happens next,” said Rubin.  This “statefulness” means that coins with CTV-enabled rules have to have some record for how the coins are supposed to be spent. This record takes the form of a template (hence CheckTemplateVerify).  How CTV works  With CTV, users can create a template that creates specific spending conditions for a coin (UTXO).  Unless a broadcasted transaction meets the specifications for the CTV transaction template, no one can spend the coins associated with the template. Users embed this template in the script of a Bitcoin transaction and enforce it using instructions specified by the OP_CTV instruction in the Bitcoin transaction (in Bitcoin, an OP_CODE gives special instructions for script transactions). Again, when someone creates a transaction to spend the CTV coins, the transaction must match the OP_CTV template to succeed.  “You can think of OP_CTV like a friend who has a key for you, but will only sign the specific transactions you told them to sign for in advance. However, Bitcoin scripts can specify multiple alternatives. So it is possible to generate an address that says either (signature with key) or (transaction matching template 1) or (transaction matching template 2), which makes what you can do with CTV more flexible than just one particular transaction,” said Rubin.  Developers often refer to this transaction design – where an OP_CODE restricts how a transaction is spent – as a covenant. Perhaps the clearest use case for a covenant: improving cold storage and custody.  Users could create covenants that specify, for example, the coins in their vault could only be sent to a specific address, or that they can only spend 0.0025 BTC at a time (these are just a couple of examples that could help in the event of an attack).  CTV would give the Lightning Network new functionality as well, giving users the ability to create “payment pools” and “channel factories,” where thousands of users can lock up funds that are represented by a single UTXO in a single on-chain transaction.  Exchanges, custodians and mining pools could use these channel factories to pay out thousands of users (on-chain) with a single UTXO (coin), a scaling win that reduces the block space all of these transactions would otherwise use.  And users can exit the channels whenever they want, “without requiring signatures from both parties,” Rubin writes in a post on one of his websites.  Payment pools could also have positive ramifications for user privacy. In addition to payment pools taking place off-chain, dozens to hundreds to thousands of users can have funds locked up in a transaction that is represented by a single coin on-chain, and they can each close their own channels at their own whims, making it harder overall to trace the funds.  Bitcoin mining pools could use these payment pools to manage payouts, or custodians and users could use them to create cold storage vaults.  Will CTV be Bitcoin’s next upgrade?  Plenty of Bitcoin developers and stakeholders see benefits to CTV, but plenty of others say that the upgrade needs more careful thought and that there are alternatives to explore. Some opponents say that CTV is unnecessary or that proponents have not clearly articulated the benefits, while a more extreme and vocal minority has called the proposal an “attack on Bitcoin.”  Perhaps the most sobering and practical refutation is the fact that Taproot – the upgrade that makes CTV possible – just activated last November, and the ecosystem is still adopting it.  When a new feature like Segwit or Taproot is soft forked into Bitcoin, it’s up to industry stakeholders, like wallet providers and exchanges, to adopt the code; going further, the services that new upgrades enable do not build themselves, and it takes time for developers, entrepreneurs and companies to design products that rely on functionality that has never been used before.  Read more: Hard Forks vs Soft Forks  “Generally, I do not think Bitcoin is ready for any new soft-forked features at all in the short term. Taproot just arrived and there is already so much work to be done to adopt and utilize it,” Synonym CEO John Carvalho wrote in the Bitcoin Developer mailing list as a response to one of Rubin’s posts.  Others feel as if prioritizing CTV makes sense right now. For the more cynical, Big Brother is keeping a closer eye on Bitcoin and its users than ever, and they worry time is running out to implement upgrades which give users greater control over their coins (and greater privacy).  For Rubin, it’s a matter of giving people improved tools, particularly privacy tools, especially those who live under stringent financial surveillance and control.  “Imagine a future where people are targeted for having bitcoin because we did not have sufficient privacy,” Rubin said. “That worries me a lot. A lot of the benefit of payment pools is not just in scalability, but in privacy too, because they keep data off-chain.”  For CTV proponents, the code is more or less vetted (there’s been a 5.5 BTC bounty on CTV for nearly six months) and the arguments against it seem to be “we need more time to evaluate alternatives.”  Alternatives to CTV  As for alternatives, some point to AnyPrevOutput (APO or BIP 118), another soft fork designed by Blockstream Core Lightning developer Christian Decker. Others, including Rubin and Decker, see each other’s BIPs as complementary.  “That’s always been my position – they are very much complementary. They have some overlap, but they are not exact ways to achieve the same end, and they were proposed in different contexts. I never had the impression that they were competitors,” said Decker.  All of this, of course, assumes the wider Bitcoin community wants these features.  So, why the wait?  But what is “Bitcoin’s wider community,” anyway? That’s part of the problem with these debates.  Bitcoin’s user base spans every continent except Antarctica, and the forum for debate includes social media, email lists and messaging groups. As bitcoin’s price has grown over the years, and the numbers of its active community swells, consensus has become increasingly unwieldy – especially considering your average person’s capacity to fully grasp the minutiae of these changes.  It’s a lot easier to drum up support for an upgrade if you campaign and educate, so Rubin has been on social media attempting to rally support for CTV (his Twitter name at one point read “BIP 119 marketing department”).  Rubin’s Twitter name change was done very much tongue in cheek because many active bitcoiners were put off by his advocacy. For sure, debate around the BIP 119 has become acidic. Its designer doesn’t mind people scrutinizing his work. What he doesn’t want, though, is undue concern from those who lack the literacy to understand CTV on a micro level.  “It’s fantastic that there are so many people who care so deeply about Bitcoin and will go to the mat to defend it,” Rubin said. That is very good. In this case, a lot of that concern is misplaced, although I understand where a lot of it comes from.”  Avid bitcoiners can be ornery, highly skeptical, and dogged in their defense of orange coin. Some of BIP 119’s opponents don’t like the fact that Rubin is advocating for an upgrade he designed (for his part, Rubin has tweeted to the effect that he doesn’t care what gets activated, but something needs to happen if privacy and custody solutions are to improve).  While the kernel of the debate may be popping with discussion about BIP 119, the fact that CTV’s critics are particularly worked up over Rubin’s advocacy of BIP 119 puts a larger debate into focus about Bitcoin’s rough consensus. Who decides upgrades? When is code “ready” to ship? And what’s the best way to activate a soft fork to make sure nothing funky happens?  With CTV and other promising soft forks like APO waiting in the dugout for their turn (if ever) at bat, a new ballgame for Bitcoin’s rough consensus on protocol evolution is in the opening inning.  And even though it looks like those who disagree are on opposite teams, ultimately everyone is working toward the same goal. They are just puzzling out which rules they want to play by, and that’s OK because “this is the work,” Rubin said, that’s required to reach a rough consensus.  “The developers who disagree on this, we’re all friends. … Bitcoin is a family, a big dysfunctional family. Ultimately we really are trying to achieve the same thing, we just don't agree on the way to get there. If one of these ways demonstrated that it was the best way to get there, then there would be more cohesion.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TRADING | FORKS,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/05/20/bip-119-unpacking-ctv-and-how-it-would-change-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e4a72145cbfb3f5cb3dc2244650b37e3322e2a2d-6000x4200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395396,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASwMso,1653051027,It’s Not Just LUNA. Terra’s DeFi Apps Have Hemorrhaged $28B,"In the two weeks since Terra's U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin terraUSD (UST) lost its peg, causing massive investor losses, billions of dollars have been taken out of the ecosystem.  Data from trackers show funds held in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications built on Terra have slumped to $155 million in locked value as of Friday morning, a level last seen in February 2021, from more than $29 billion at the start of this month. Locked value on Terra DeFi peaked at $30 billion in early April.  The declines came as UST lost its 1:1 peg against the U.S. dollar amid a broader slump in markets. That created a death spiral as investors exchanged UST for other stablecoins, sending the Terra token to as low as 4 cents on May 14.  “Experiencing significant losses, or seeing others take significant losses – at no fault of their own – is probably one of the fastest ways for a protocol or blockchain in this space to lose the trust of the community,” Simon Furlong, co-founder of Geode Finance, told CoinDesk in an email.  As widely reported, much of the lost value was on the lending protocol Anchor, which took the biggest hit, the data show. It held more than $17 billion on May 6 and locked up just over $106 million on Friday – a drop of over 99%. Anchor was home to Terra’s infamous “stable yields,” where investors could lock up their UST to earn about 19% on a yearly basis.  “UST’s fall rendered Terra’s most popular protocol, Anchor, effectively useless,” Furlong said. “Nobody is interested in earning rewards on a stablecoin that is trending toward $0.”  Market observers had previously raised red flags about Anchor’s yield, with critics calling it unsustainable. That didn’t deter investors from piling in over $16 billion from July 2021 to early May.  Other apps show similar percentage declines. Lido, which pays out daily rewards on staked assets, saw a $7 billion plunge in value, while automated exchange Astroport and lending app Mars Protocol saw a combined $1.2 billion decline in total value locked (TVL).  How TVL figures fell  Owing to the way UST operates, the price of the associated luna (LUNA) token fell as much as 99.7% in less than a week. One UST can be redeemed or minted for exactly $1 worth of LUNA at any time, a mechanism that's meant to keep UST stable by using market forces to alter the supply and price of LUNA to match demand.  As a result, when UST fell, excess LUNA was minted to try and maintain its peg. This time it failed to revive UST as sentiment for the tokens among crypto investors declined.  The slump has caused some of the biggest investment firms within the crypto market to suffer massive losses. On-chain data shows South Korea’s Hashed lost some $3.5 billion, while Delphi lost at least 13% of its funds under management.  Terra backers Galaxy Digital and Three Arrows Capital have also been affected, although the firms have not publicly provided figures.  Analysts point out issues  While Terra developers have put a revival plan in place to recover the ecosystem and ensure long-term growth, some analysts say a lack of trust remains.  “Traders and investors suffered tremendous losses and doubt management’s actions that followed the UST unpegging,” said Anton Gulin, regional director at crypto exchange AAX, in a Telegram chat. “Anything incoming from Luna’s team may be treated in the same way as the lack of trust prevails.”  Terra developers are proposing a hard fork of the network – which would create a separate, new blockchain – as part of the revival. The community is apparently not on board, however: Results of an online preliminary poll this week saw 92% of responders vote “no” to the proposed change.  “Trust has been lost, but in the event of compensation for losses and a return of funds, there are chances for its restoration,” KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu told CoinDesk in an email. ""If the ecosystem and the team can handle the recovery process wisely, this will be a positive signal not only for project investors but also for new users and the entire market.”",NEGATIVE,LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | LUNA | MARKET | FORKS,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/20/its-not-just-luna-terras-defi-apps-have-hemmorhaged-28b,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a604932aa05a827543a02a98c4e9d227ba6c756d-3267x2450.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to Statista, only 48 percent of the African population has access to banking services in 2022. Accounts being the first point of entry into the formal financial system puts its citizens at an enormous setback as they are forced to turn to transactions that are not only inconvenient and wasteful but often risky too. Having access to a financial account instead of just cash allows users to take control of their finances by offering ways to manage money.

The fall of the ALGO price from November 2021 is about 80%. This is the market average. However, not all cryptocurrencies show on the chart the interest of investors to keep the price. Looking at the weekly ALGO timeframe, it can be seen that trading volumes increased even before the final drain. During the weekly candle of 2 May, buyers were preparing to reverse the downward trend and closed the weekly candle with an &apos;absorption&apos; pattern. However, the Bitcoin market was set to fall sharply and the idea of ​​ALGO buyers failed. https://www.tradingview.com/x/i1dxAKkC/ As a result, the ALGO price tested an important range of $0.44 on anomalous volumes. Looking at the history of ALGO price movements, this range has prevented buyers from continuing the growth trend throughout 2020. Given the importance of this range, we expect at least a minimal rebound of the ALGO price to $0.68. This is the closest liquidity level from which sellers have every chance to continue the downward trend. Trading such a situation on the market is quite risky, so you should correctly calculate the amount of investment that can be risked.

International standard setters are hoping to streamline current clunky and expensive systems for cross-border remittances – but to unlock the potential of blockchain-style tech, first they may need to turn away from rules that traditionally assume a single central player is in charge.  “Enhancing cross-border payments is a multifaceted problem requiring a comprehensive approach, and DLT could be one way of addressing these inefficiencies,” as noted by the working paper, written by a team led by University of Luxembourg professor Dirk Zetzsche. However, “financial law traditionally assumes that functions are concentrated in a single entity,” the paper noted.  That hits the nub of why regulators and the crypto world are often in such conflict. Traditional financial regulations are focused on institutions such as banks, and it isn’t easy to shoehorn blockchain payments or smart contracts into that model. In practice, regulators tend to look for intermediaries on to whom obligations such as anti-money laundering checks can be piled, for example those providing crypto exchange or wallet services.  That may need to change, Zetzsche said – with rules switching to a mentality where by default you regulate, not individual nodes, but the distributed system as a whole.  Blockchain benefits  Existing cross-border payments, which often hinge on banks forming “correspondent” partnerships with overseas equivalents, allow them to charge “oligopolistic rents” that let them push up prices for the ordinary user, the paper said.  But “DLT could be used to create competition” among payment service providers by allowing people to easily select the best deal on the market, the paper said. The study also cites as a benefit easier client identification, meaning more people get into the financial system without raising money laundering risks.  Regulations should focus on the ledger when looking at issues like how the system takes decisions and manages risks, and in any other case where it would improve efficiency due to DLT’s transparency or security, the authors argue – with developers setting out the exact details in advance in a Plan of Operations that regulators have to approve.  DLT isn’t the only way to cut the cost of cross-border transfers. Another recent BIS paper examined the impact of more prosaic changes, like having central banks stay online at night and on weekends.  But international payments – making it easy to send salaries home to the developing world via remittances, for example – were a key motivation for stablecoin projects such as the now-abandoned Libra, then renamed Diem.

There’s also very limited scope for an increase in labor force participation because of the declines, it said.  The bank said an important consideration is the share of crypto wealth held by investors in other countries. Goldman estimates that U.S. households own roughly one-third of the global crypto market’s $1.3 trillion market cap. This means that the recent decline in the market cap is very small relative to U.S. household net worth, which stood at $150 trillion in the fourth quarter 2021.  Recent crypto price declines have likely reduced U.S. crypto holdings by about $300 billion, and these holdings now account for only 0.3% of household net worth, the note said.  In contrast, equities accounted for around 33% of household net worth at the end of last year, and the recent fall in stock markets has likely reduced household net worth by about $8 trillion, the note added.  Tighter financial conditions will result in a rapid slowdown in growth and spending this year, but any incremental impact from the recent fall in crypto prices will likely be “modest”, the report said.

Recent market instability in stablecoins “will absolutely need to be taken into account” when the Financial Conduct Authority works with the Treasury to create the rules later this year, Sarah Pritchard, the FCA's executive director for markets, told Bloomberg.  On May 13, Terra's UST algorithmic stablecoin slumped as low as 23 cents, and the LUNA token, created to prevent the UST algorithmic stablecoin from being volatile, fell 96% at one point. An algorithmic stablecoin is one that in theory maintains its peg using only software and rules, meaning it is not necessarily backed by collateral. Instead, the token’s programming, or smart contract, can increase supply if the price is falling or reduce supply if the price is increasing.  ""Recent events in crypto asset markets have highlighted the need for appropriate regulation to help mitigate consumer, market integrity and financial stability risks,"" a spokesperson at the Treasury said. ""The government will continue to work with the regulators to address these risks as it develops its legislative approach.""  In March, the U.K. said it will work on a new crypto regulatory package and planned to regulate stablecoins. In its consultation, the government proposed that algorithmic stablecoins should not be regulated.  The FCA were not immediately available to comment when contacted by CoinDesk on Friday.

Bitcoin dropped to nearly $24,000 in the past week amid systemic risks within the crypto ecosystem and inflation fears in the broader market. The asset has slid for seven straight weeks as of Friday.  The asset’s price movements have been highly correlated to the U.S. markets in the past few months, with poor earnings reports and hawkish comments from the Federal Reserve having an impact on bitcoin prices.  Investors are placing bets accordingly.  Put/call ratios for bitcoin open interest hit a 12-month high of 0.72 yesterday, research firm Delphi said in a note Friday, adding that the data indicated “bearish sentiment among investors.” Similar ratio levels were reached last May.  “The put/call ratio measures the amount of put buying relative to calls,” Delphi analysts explained in the note. “A high put/call ratio indicates that investors are speculating whether bitcoin will continue to sell off, or it could mean investors are hedging their portfolios against a downward move.”  “Last April, the put/call ratio traded as high as 0.96 before Bitcoin’s price dropped over 50% in May 2021,” the firm added.  Put options are a contract that gives the option buyer the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified amount of an underlying asset at a given price. Call options, on the hand, allow call buyers to purchase the asset at a predetermined price in the future.  At the time of writing, there over 63,000 bitcoin worth of open interest on options are set to expire on May 27.  Thursday’s surge in the put/call ratios surpassed previous 2022 highs of 0.69 in February and are up 38% from one-year lows of 0.44 in December, data from analytics tool skew shows.

40831,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=236443,1653006627,Here’s Why DeFi’s Total Value Will Regain Traction After the Recent Plunge,"Since its inception, DeFi seemed to have a Midas touch. Growth was explosive, and innovations were constantly popping up. The competition wasn&apos;t on if projects would come up but on the ones that would break the $100 million mark first. However, a recent bearish market has put a halt to the good times. At $111.88 billion by the time of writing, the total value locked has dropped by 53% from a high of $236.64 billion at the start of 2022. Yet DeFi is expected to get back on its feet. Read on to find out why. Understanding the Cause of the Plunge To best understand why DeFi is bound to get back to the good times, it is worth knowing why things fell apart in the first place.

Abundant liquidity drove most asset prices, such as crypto and stocks, into a massive bull run since 2020. However, the resultant huge money supply expansion caused inflation to rise to a 40yr high. To combat the rapid inflation rise hurt consumer expenditures since salaries don&apos;t rise in tandem with inflation, prompting Fed action. ...",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/heres-why-defis-total-value-will-regain-traction-after-the-recent-plunge/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-why-defis-total-value-will-regain-traction-after-the-recent-plunge,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png
