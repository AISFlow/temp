42426133,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjHVh,1414875530,Malaysian Taxi Customers Can Now Pay with Bitcoin,"Taxi passengers in the Malaysian cities of Kuala Lumpur and Johor Bahru can now pay for their rides in bitcoin, thanks to a booking service called Taximonger.  Bitcoin Malaysia reported that it believes Taximonger offers the first opportunity for Asian taxi customers to use bitcoin, adding that for Malaysia it also represents the first cashless payment system for cabs, a long overdue addition.  Taximonger  offers a simple taxi matching service for passengers and about 1,400 drivers. There are apps for both iOS and Android, and customers can also book using the website.  Rather than scanning QR codes in the cab, bitcoin users send their payment to the app itself. The amounts are then converted to Malaysian ringgit and drivers receive a daily payment.  The video below demonstrates how it works:  The payment processor driving Taximonger was developed by local bitcoin enthusiast Arsyan Ismail and his team at BitRinggit, who have also produced Cryptomarket Malaysia and a Malaysian brokerage exchange.  There are also plans to extend bitcoin to other 'white label' apps from Taximonger in Malaysia, CAB2klia and JohorCab, soon.  Early adopters  Taxi drivers and companies have long been identified as candidates for bitcoin adoption and several companies around the world have been early adopters.  The payment method offers significant advantages over other electronic payment systems as it requires no special hardware for reading cards and no fees above whatever the payment processor charges. Bitcoin also offers considerable security and convenience benefits over cash, with taxi drivers being among the most vulnerable to theft.  Cab companies, booking services and individual drivers have all experimented with bitoin, or at least toyed with the idea, though it is not clear whether all still accept the currency.  New York cab drivers are reportedly free to accept bitcoin on an individual basis if they choose, and a picture posted online may show at least one driver who does.

42426141,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjHlh,1414863612,BitAngels Names Three Global Startups to Showcase at Money 20/20,"BitAngels has announced three winners of its global startup competition, the top two of which are set to showcase at the forthcoming Money 20/20 conference in an event called CoinDebut.  India-based pre-launch mobile bitcoin wallet ZebPay received first place and best presentation; Austin, TX-based Factom, a 'proof of existence' technology for tracking and auditing documents through the block chain, placed second and was recognized for being the best pre-launch company; and Mountain View, California-based Rivetz, a developer of hardware-based security products for bitcoin and other protocols placed third.  CoinAgenda  is a conference for bitcoin and cryptocurrency investors that takes place annually in Las Vegas close to Bitcoin Week Las Vegas, which this year included the Hashers United mining conference and Inside Bitcoins international trade show.  This year the competition, arranged in conjunction with the bitcoin angel investor group, took place on 8th–9th October. Contestants were evaluated by a judge panel that included venture capitalists Matt Roszak of Tally Capital, William Quigley from Clearstone Ventures and Pantera Capital’s Stephen Waterhouse.  Michael Terpin, CoinAgenda producer and BitAngels co-founder, said of the winners:  “We were blown away by the quality of the companies who presented. The VC panel was also quite impressed, calling it one of the best selections of early-stage bitcoin companies they’ve seen anywhere.”  Defensible innovation  Terpin said that many VCs look at the quality of the competing teams, size of the market opportunity they present and the level of defensible innovation they bring, and that all of the winners met each criterion.  He explained that the panelists appreciated the credibility that ZebPay brought to the competition.  ""In the case of ZebPay, [the panelists] liked that the founding team had built successful companies before, including the largest bitcoin exchange in India,"" he said.  Factom provides distributed, immutable ledgers to track transactions and claims to be able to secure thousands of transactions in a single hash and eliminate block chain 'bloat'. In September, the company told CoinDesk that Factom was in the process of rebranding from the NotaryChains Project.  Terpin said:  “With Factom, it was the sheer potential of being able to tie all the world's data to the block chain in a compressed, yet searchable, format that has extensive real-world applications. From medical records to real estate, combined with a team featuring some of the top veterans of the nascent bitcoin 2.0 space.”  Finally, he said that Rivetz showed the “factors of a giant market opportunity”. The company provides wallet vendors with the first Trusted Execution Environment-secured bitcoin keys, thereby allowing users of smart phones, tablets, computers and any other devices that use the trusted computing standard to make safe transactions tied to their identity across multiple channels.  About BitAngels  BitAngels  is the first global incubator that exclusively focuses on early-stage bitcoin-related startups and the digital currency ecosystem, giving them the resources, funding and guidance by mentors in its worldwide network to begin their business and see it through fruition.  Since its inception in May 2013, it has attracted such bitcoin heavyweights as Roger Ver, Brock Pierce, Gyft CEO Vinny Lingham and Tradehill CEO Jered Kenna. At the beginning of this year it reported it had invested $7m total in 12 startups, including CoinTerra and GoCoin.  In April, it closed a 10,000 BTC fund, then valued at $4.6m, dedicated to companies working on decentralized platforms that utilize bitcoin’s block chain technology.

42426138,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjHZh,1414854042,Proof of Gourd: #BitcoinWeen Charity Contest Inspires Bitcoin Jack-O'-Lanterns,"Pumpkin carving is one of the most time-honored traditions surrounding Halloween, offering revelers the chance to cook up creations both spooky and spectacular.  Bitcoiners are no exception, as shown by a recent social media movement dubbed #BitcoinWeen. The movement was sparked on 28th October, when Blockchain CEO Nic Cary issued a call for jack-o’-lantern carvings inspired by either bitcoin or Blockchain.  Further, he offered to donate $500 in bitcoin to a charity chosen by the creator of the most retweeted pumpkin, sharing a couple of creations of his own.

Many opted for the classic bitcoin symbol, while others took more detailed approaches.  Cary told CoinDesk that the project first began as a simple effort to carve pumpkins with the Blockchain team. He explained:    ""I didn't anticipate how diffcult it would be to get hold of suitable pumpkins here in the UK, but eventually I tracked some down. We decided to turn the idea into an opportunity to bring some attention to all the amazing bitcoin accepting charities and non-profits that work tirelessly to support their communities.""          Noting entries from supporters around the world, Cary added that the response demonstrates the community spirit that he said embodies the bitcoin movement.

42426131,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjHPh,1414849227,Bitcoin's AML/CTF Regulatory Creep Means Time for Specific Industry Regulation,"Peter Oakes is a business strategist and non-executive director with particular interest in FinTech and digital currencies. He advises bitcoin firms and financial institutions. He was the first Director of Enforcement and Anti-Money Laundering at the newly formed Central Bank of Ireland, and he previously worked as an enforcement lawyer for the former UK Financial Services Authority and a senior officer of the Australian Securities & Investments Commission. In this essay he argues that innovations like digital currencies deserve better than regulation under existing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CTF) rules.  The US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has issued two administrative rulings relating to virtual currencies.  These rulings look likely to capture additional bitcoin exchanges and now bitcoin payment processors as money service businesses (MSBs) under US regulations. Although bitcoin exchanges have, by and large, always been under contention for regulation as MSBs, the same was not thought to be the case for bitcoin payment processors.  The rulings will have quite an impact on these industries, the wider digital currency movement and of course a rush to embed AML/CTF programs (at least to the US FinCEN standards) at a new range of virtual currency firms. Simply put, this will lead to more confusion for their boards, more work for the consultants/lawyers [disclaimer – I am one], more confusion at regulators (not just in the US) [disclaimer – I was one] when bombarded with requests for rulings/guidance on applicability and leaving consumers [disclaimer – I am one], the end users, totally bamboozled about what the wave of disparate international regulation means for them when/if transacting.  Application of US thinking to EU Payment Services Directive  Having read through the rulings, my personal view is that if the US regulator's interpretative thinking was transposed to the (as drafted) EU Payment Services Directive (PSD), it is arguable that the same outcome would be arrived at in Europe; thereby seeing the PSD become the sector specific regulatory regime for bitcoin service providers. Yet many of us have experienced divergence amongst EU state regulators as to whether, or not, item 6 of the PSD Schedule (ie: money transmission) applies to bitcoin and other digital currency service providers.  Separately, it seems that some EU state regulators might be attempting to deliberately narrow down (without sound logic) interpreting these bitcoin firms falling under the EU Directive. The driving rationale appears to be one of fear: not wanting to be amongst a group of first movers. Instead waiting (perhaps praying) for the European Commission to promote a bitcoin specific law so they don't have to make a fair and reasoned decision.  This brings up another issue – the EU financial services regime was established to do a number of things, including: (i) promote harmonisation, (ii) greater integration within the EU, (iii) fairer treatment of its people and users of its markets, and (iii) advance the economic well-being of its democratic people. The regime was never intended to shield EU state regulators from making judgement calls based on sound consideration of the facts before it vis-a-vis the Directives they administer.  This method of thinking just ""kicks the can down the road"" – a saying popular during the financial crisis to describe inaction by banks and central bankers to grasp the real financial stability issues at play. Here regulators are doing the same thing. They are treating EU law like it is a product owned and controlled by a master franchisor in Brussels, under which they (the EU state regulators) are mere franchisees entitling them to abdicate their mandated and democratic right to make decisions based on the evidence and facts before it. Yet whenever they are nervous about an outcome, reached by informed analysis, they seek to defer to the master franchisor as a higher authority. A little bit of regulatory leadership – not just on digital currencies but across the board – would not go astray here!  Time for specific digital currency law in the EU  Isn't it time then for a specific digital currency regulatory regime? Other financial service industries have sector specific EU law. Yet it seems that regulators around the world agree on one thing at the moment – if we are to regulate digital currencies let's do it through the prism of AML/CFT regulation. If regulators don't act quickly to decide upon a cohesive and joined up strategic approach to the regulation of digital currency firms using specific subject matter regulation then AML/CTF laws will continue to be used to regulate the digital currency industry leading to inequitable treatment of consumers and firms alike. As I note above, I think that in Europe there already exists a specific industry law for many digital currency service providers – ie: the PSD.  Leading the regulation of digital regulations by AML/CTF laws has certainly been a feature of some credible 'offshore' regulators which have expanded their existing AML/CTF laws to capture digital currency service providers. It also sounds like the EU AML/CTF Directive is heading for the same treatment. This can, and should only be, a stop gap measure. You would not regulate a stockbroker, for example, only by way of AML/CFT law because it doesn't capture the essence of their business model or the services they provide to consumers – thus they are specifically regulated in the EU under the MIFID (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) and subject to AML/CTF laws for financial crime purposes. The same applies in the case of insurance companies, banks and mutual funds – all of which are subject to specific subject matter EU regulation (not regulatory led by AML/CFT laws).  Not having a digital/virtual currency specific regime on the EU drawing books shows just how slow regulators, as a whole, are to responding to innovation generally in the consumer financial services markets. They could perhaps be forgiven if bitcoin etc were just OTC instruments traded between wholesale institutional banks. But they are not – consumers are treating them as a medium of exchange and as a currency. Consumers deserve better treatment by these important regulatory players, especially after so many of them dropped the ball when it came to mainstream oversight of banks in recent years.  Another concern I have about AML/CTF laws being used to lead the regulation of digital currencies is that consumers will be lulled into a false sense of security that these AML/CTF driven regulations somehow equate to greater consumer protection. Consumers will not differentiate between the policy objectives of the AML/CTF law and consumer protection regime. When they hear that ABC Inc, Ltd etc is regulated (without appreciating why it is regulated), they will slip into the 'moral hazard' zone thinking that 'That's great, so my client assets are protected and I get the usual consumer protection safeguards as with anyone else regulated'. Sadly, consumers could not be further from the truth of course.  This article has been republished here with permission from the author. Originally published on LinkedIn.

42426149,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjHzh,1414841451,What Bitcoin Can Learn from Social Media's Success,"Facebook, MySpace and Twitter took the web by storm in the 2000s, enabling a wave of communication never before possible on the Internet.  The appeal of social media didn't transition from tech-savvy high schoolers to the mass market overnight, however. It took time for the industry to build the necessary infrastructure to properly scale for mainstream use.  Because of its status as new and disruptive technology, there are some who see the parallels between the social media industry and the bitcoin industry.  Sean Percival  , who was involved in the early stages of social media as the vice president of MySpace and now focuses on digital currencies as an investor, has observed what he considers striking similarities.  He told CoinDesk:  “This rise of bitcoin is almost identical to what I saw during the early days of social media.”  As a partner at 500 Startups, Percival has invested in a number of bitcoin companies, and he feels that bitcoin is on the cusp of crossing the chasm to becoming more mainstream, he said.  “In terms of the social media timeline this would be 2007 right now. Twitter was just starting to take off and MySpace was still king,” he added.  The water mark  While the price of bitcoin has not risen at a dramatic pace as some might have expected, there are other metrics to look at as evidence the digital currency is growing.  The number of investments in bitcoin-related startups continues to rise, and has well surpassed the amount of investment in 2013. Data on bitcoin venture investments shows there has been more than $280m in investments so far in 2014, a figure that towers over 2013's $91m figure.  Exchange volume is also increasing despite a sagging price, which suggests investors continue to look at bitcoin as a new global asset class with real value. It's creating business opportunity for exchanges and over time improving liquidity in the markets.  As someone that invests in bitcoin startups, Percival clearly sees this particular part of the sector as catalyst for growth in the technology.  He doesn't think bitcoin may necessarily be at the forefront of people’s minds should it become popular. No one really understands the cloud computing and data storage technologies behind social media's infrastructure, but it has been crucial to its overall rise.  He said:  “The technology itself is more likely to succeed when it fades into the background. When you’re using bitcoin and you don’t even know it, that’s when bitcoin wins.”  Identity, not anonymity  There was a time during bitcoin’s Silk Road era when many people believed that block chain-based cryptocurrencies were anonymous. Not so.  The industry has seen a number of notable mishaps, and scammers are having block chain-based forensics performed on their transactions, proving that basic bitcoin transactions are more pseudonymous than anonymous.  It's possible that bitcoin will need to embrace identity to become popular – something Facebook succeeded at, removing anonymity and forcing people to use real identities on the Internet.  ""The main value of bitcoin isn't anonymity,” said Nathan Lands, the CEO of Facebook-connected bitcoin wallet QuickCoin. “Our launch did show us that people will use bitcoin with identity attached and in a social nature.""  Lands' thinking is that social media will be required in order for bitcoin to grow. This is why he and his team started QuickCoin in the first place – to initiate that viral spread in digital currencies.  The key is realizing people are used to thinking about utility, and not in theoretical terms about what bitcoin could or should be. If QuickCoin or some other bitcoin startup can build from that and succeed, it could mean massive growth more broadly.  Lands said:  “You can build unique social applications with bitcoin that give people a reason to use bitcoin and at the same time actually help it spread as well.”  Bitcoin needs social media  Bitcoin’s current market capitalization is over $4bn, but its growth is still small in the context of the social media industry. As a public company, Facebook has a $208bn market cap with more than 1 billion people actively using it.  But the industries aren't competing with each other. As social media is now a critical component of the Internet, it could prove integral to the spread of bitcoin.  Some bitcoin entrepreneurs are already looking to harness social media to do just that, with QuickCoin and another startup called ZapChain being the most notable examples. The intention of ZapChain is to educate and thus grow bitcoin awareness, according to its CEO Matt Schlicht.  He said:  “Social media is the best way for information to spread across the Internet and the world. Period. If used correctly, social media has the ability to drastically increase bitcoin's rate of adoption.”  With social media, even though there was some resistance from some who believed there were privacy issues, it was able to overcome these obstacles by focusing on user experience and utility.  The bitcoin industry would do well to keep this in mind, should it want to achieve similar results.
