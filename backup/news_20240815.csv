32462378,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635667,1723761017,"Bitcoin Observes Pullback To $58,000: Is This The Cause?","Bitcoin has observed a pullback down to the $58,000 level during the past day. Here’s what could be the cause behind it, according to on-chain data. Exchanges Have Seen A Large Amount Of Tether Withdrawals Recently According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, centralized exchanges have recently seen a Tether (USDT) outflow spree exceeding $1 billion. Related Reading: This Is The On-Chain Level That Made The Bitcoin Crash Bottom Investors usually keep their coins in exchanges when they want to trade them in the near future, so them making the move to withdraw their tokens potentially implies that they are interested in holding into the long-term. For volatile assets like Bitcoin, exchange outflows can naturally be a bullish sign for this reason. In the context of the current topic, though, the asset being withdrawn is a stablecoin, so the implication for the market is a bit different. Generally, investors store their capital in the form of fiat-tied tokens like Tether when they want to escape the volatility associated with coins like BTC. Such holders do eventually plan to venture back into the other side of the market and they may use exchanges for doing so. When holders buy into assets like Bitcoin using their stablecoin, they naturally end up boosting their prices. As such, exchange inflows of stables can be a bullish sign for the sector. Withdrawals of USDT and others into self-custody instead, however, can be a bearish sign for the market, as it shows the investors don’t believe they would be making a swap into the volatile side in the near future. The latest Tether withdrawals may, therefore, be why the Bitcoin price has tumbled. This USDT exiting exchanges could even have represented fresh BTC sells, as many investors like to move into self-custody as soon as they have swapped between assets. As IntoTheBlock has pointed out in the chart, the last two large USDT exchange outflows also had a bearish effect on BTC. In some other news, the cryptocurrency derivatives market as a whole has seen a large amount of liquidations as a result of the volatility that Bitcoin and other coins have displayed during the past day. Below is a table from CoinGlass that sums up the liquidations that have occurred in the latest volatile market phase. As is visible above, around $146 million in cryptocurrency liquidations have occurred over the past day, with $120 million coming from the long contracts alone, representing more than 80% of the total. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Are “Important, But Not The Drivers,” On-Chain Analyst Argues Interestingly, Ethereum (ETH) is the symbol that has contributed the most towards this derivatives flush and not Bitcoin like is usually the case. That said, ETH has only $6 million more liquidations than BTC. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $58,800, down 4% over the last 24 hours.

42390595,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd42R3,1723758198,Goldman Sachs Joins Morgan Stanley in Holding Bitcoin ETFs as Institutional Interest Grows: 13F Wrap,"Investment advisors were the largest holders of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds as they held a total of $4.7 billion on behalf of clients.  Goldman Sachs held $418 million worth of bitcoin while Morgan Stanley purchased $188 million.  Investment advisors including Wall Street giants Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were among the biggest holders of spot bitcoin {{BTC}} ETFs at the end of second quarter, as clients amped up their crypto allocations to a total of $4.7 billion.  Goldman Sachs held $418 million worth of bitcoin on behalf of its clients in the months as of June 30, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The modest customer allocation comes after the chief investment officer of the bank’s wealth management unit told the Wall Street Journal in April that the bank's clients weren't showing a lot of interest in the asset class.  Morgan Stanley – which reportedly just gave the green light for its brokers to offer the bitcoin ETFs to clients – held $188 million worth of the spot funds on June 30, an $87 million decline from three months earlier.  Both Wall Street powerhouses favored BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), now the largest of the spot ETFs, but they also purchased shares of Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) and the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) as well as some of the other offerings.  “It’s clear that institutional adoption of spot bitcoin ETFs continues to accelerate,” said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store. “Generally speaking, institutional investors tend to have extremely rigorous due diligence processes which can lengthen the adoption period for any type of investment. The speed at which institutional investors are wading into spot bitcoin ETFs is astounding.”  A small number of well-known hedge funds continued with stakes in the bitcoin ETFs, among them Izzy Englander's Millennium Management. Notably, however, Paul Singer's Elliott Management – which disclosed a $12 million stake in BlackRock's IBIT at the end of the first quarter – had totally exited that position by this latest June 30 reporting date.  Another holder of interest at the end of the first quarter was the Wisconsin Pension Fund, which in the last quarter doubled down on its IBIT position as it purchased an additional 447,651 shares of the fund. It also got rid of all of its shares of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) which were worth $63.7 million at the end of March. The state now owns 2,898,051 shares or $98.9 million as of the end of June.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/08/15/goldman-sachs-joins-as-institutional-interest-in-bitcoin-etfs-grew-in-q2,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f93c53a1e5e5a8d65575d8062215a37c535db8d5-3000x1687.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This massive SHIB accumulation signals investors growing confidence in the popular meme-based cryptocurrency. SHIB Whales Increase Holdings By Almost 600% In just a single day, Shiba Inu whales increased their holdings by approximately 596%. According to IntoTheBlock’s data, on August 12, the total net flow of large scale SHIB holders had surged from 27.06 billion SHIB to 161.15 billion SHIB. Related Reading: Private Investors Kicked Out Of Top Bitcoin Holder List, Here Are The Stats While the reason for this aggressive token accumulation remains uncertain, the slight stabilization of Shiba Inu’s price fundamentals may have contributed to the positive shift in investors’ sentiment. Earlier in January 2024, large scale holder net flow had surged as high as 4.51 trillion. However as the months went by, whales have been offloading significant amounts of SHIB tokens as the market showed signs of bearishness. This renewed influx of whale activity is particularly noteworthy as Shiba Inu aims to recover from previous price declines. Additionally, the increase in whale holdings comes after Shiba Inu lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama announced the imminent release of a potentially bullish project in the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Highlighting Kusama’s announcement, crypto analyst, Oscar Ramos has expressed optimism about Shiba Inu’s future price outlook. In an X (formerly Twitter) post Ramos revealed that he believes that Shiba Inu is heading towards the biggest coin breakout it has ever seen. He highlights the ongoing developments and upcoming projects set to launch within the ecosystem as bullish catalysts for Shiba Inu’s price increase. Additionally, Ramos described Shiba Inu as a blue chip cryptocurrency which has been showing immense productivity and growth recently. At the time of writing, the price of Shiba Inu is trading at $0.0000136, marking a 1.47% decrease in the last 24 hours after gaining 2.20% over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. Shiba Inu Whale Drains $2.2 Million Worth Of SHIB On-chain analytics platform, Arkham Intelligence has uncovered a massive SHIB transaction executed by an anonymous whale. According to Arkham’s reports, an unknown Shiba Inu whale withdrew a whopping 165.37 billion SHIB tokens from Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the United States (US). Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Reveals What Could Drive The Bitcoin Price To $48,000 Arkham Intelligence has disclosed that in the last six days, the anonymous whale executed three large scale transactions which amounted to the 165.37 billion SHIB. The total value of the SHIB withdrawal was estimated at around $2.25 million. In the first transaction, 32.537 billion SHIB, valued at $466,250 was withdrawn from Coinbase. The second transaction saw a withdrawal of 35.80 billion SHIB, worth over $480,530.

42390600,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd42qh,1723751820,Schumer Sets Stage for New Era of U.S. Crypto Politics,"The big news from the Crypto4Harris town hall Wednesday night is that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is going to try to pass a crypto bill through the upper chamber by the end of the year.  ""Congress has a responsibility to provide common sense and sound regulation on crypto, and we need your support to make sure that any proposal is bipartisan,"" he told the online group, which was assembled to prove that Democrats are “engaged” on crypto issues this election year. Of course, the background here is that Democrats… haven’t exactly been engaged on crypto for a long time.  The Biden Administration has said little publicly on the issue but has quietly backed a host of crypto-unfriendly actions through the Department of Treasury and, by proxy, the Securities and Exchange Commission. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a close ally of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, is widely seen to have driven the administration crypto policy, which has involved a host of aggressive enforcement actions against the industry, while offering few clear guidelines as to what is and isn’t permissible when dealing in digital assets in the United States. So, to see Schumer make time on his schedule, appear at the Crypto4Harris event and make a legislative commitment is, to use a Biden phrase, a BFD.  Even if that effort may not become law (because it’s an election year and few ideas become law, ever), such action from a high-ranking Democrat is striking. A month ago, before Donald Trump gave his very pro-Bitcoin speech in Nashville, it’s not clear that Schumer even had a legislative wishlist on crypto.  The organizers of the Crypto4Harris event were certainly happy with how the evening went.  “We succeeded in spotlighting our big tent and showing that crypto is not just the loudest MAGA crypto bros you see online,” G Clay Miller, one of the organizers, told CoinDesk in an interview. (Miller, a former Senate staffer, has a job in the crypto industry working for a leading digital assets advisory firm, but says his political work is separate.)  Miller said 1,500 people registered ahead of the town hall and that 1,000 were in attendance at any one time.  The organizers’ main goal was to show the outside world that Democrats were interested in getting things done on crypto, despite the Biden administration’s record. It was also to send a “loud message” to the Harris campaign that crypto was paying attention to what the vice president was, and wasn’t saying, on the issue. Miller said campaign staffers listened in and were impressed with what they heard. The big question is what it will take for Democrats to prove to crypto folk that they are serious about a “policy reset.” It’s unclear at this stage exactly what might be included in Schumer’s bill. But bipartisanship seems at least possible. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), who heads the powerful House Financial Services Committee and has been a leading voice for crypto legislation in this Congress, tweeted support for Schumer this morning.  Matthew Graham, a prominent crypto VC, also gave cautious support, echoing others.  Following the town hall, Custodia Bank's Caitlin Long said she was willing to reserve judgment on who might lead policymaking in a Harris administration.  Jake Brukhman, founder and CEO at CoinFund, was more skeptical:  “I saw a lot of politicians on this call, and a few industry people (mostly legal), and I didn’t listen to the whole event, but I didn’t see ANYONE resembling the crypto company founders of the 100+ companies we have in our portfolio at @coinfund_io,” he tweeted.  And many of those who supported Trump outright were dismissive. Here’s David Bailey, the BTC Media CEO who brought the former president to Nashville recently:  It’s hard to know where we’ll end up: Will there really be a Schumer-led bill this year? Will Harris support the work of groups like Crypto4Harris (she hasn’t said anything officially yet)? Will those in crypto who supported Trump as their only option now gravitate back toward Harris, whom they might support on other issues?  Who knows? What we do know is that D.C., Democrats are at least paying attention this year. They realize they have to do something on crypto policy. And it seems likely that the crypto vote, which until recently was all for Trump, might now be split.  The industry might even have something resembling a choice in November.

32457745,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635746,1723750202,Aptos (APT) Inks 25% Gain After Hitting A New Milestone – Details,"Aptos (APT) goes against the market’s general downward momentum. According to CoinGecko, the token is up more than 25% since last week, a good sign despite the broader market dipping by 3% in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin SV Makes A Surprise Move With 10% Uptick – Details The network is breaking new ground today. The Aptos main X account recently announced that their platform achieved a new high in transactions per second (TPS), a metric that is based on how fast the network can process transactions without any downtime. This win shows that Aptos can punch above its weight, competing with big players like Solana and Ethereum in the highly-stacked crypto market. Achievement Unlocked: High TPS Creates New Hype For Aptos According to Aptos, the network broke the 4,000 real-time transactions per second threshold, having a peak of nearly 12,500 TPS yesterday. The network is flexing its muscle as this contributed greatly to APT’s current price range. 📈@Aptos facilitated ~50x more daily txs than @ethereum (L1) and ~10x more than @base (L2). pic.twitter.com/JayZAPlluD — Token Terminal (@tokenterminal) August 14, 2024 The achievement has been applauded by users on the platform with replies to the post ranging from “amazing” to “Let’s break all the (expletive) records.” The hype generated by this achievement was further boosted as Token Terminal, a blockchain analytics platform, stated that Aptos processed more transactions than both Ethereum and Base combined. Related Reading: HODLing Resurgence? 374,000 Bitcoin Transfer Ignites Crypto Recovery “@Aptos facilitated ~50x more daily txs than @ethereum (L1) and ~10x more than @base (L2)” said Token Terminal, showing that Aptos has the infrastructure and the network capacity to go against the big players of the crypto community. Aptos is also repeatedly compared to Solana, a direct competitor to Aptos, with reevolution.apt stating that Aptos will flip Solana in the future. This bullishness on the platform can be seen on-chain as almost all metrics have gained significant upticks since then. Rejection On This Level Might Threaten APT Gains As of writing, APT has been rejected on a crucial price ceiling of $6.8, continuing the downward trend it started yesterday. With this in mind, the token might see more pain in the short term, possibly moving back to more sustainable levels of momentum. However, APT poses a huge threat to other layer-1s in the market. Boasting high throughput with no downtime is a game changer to the overall user experience on the platform. But the token’s current position is still threatened by the overall market momentum which, as it currently stands, is bearish as the market continues to slip under the pressure of the bears. In the short term, investors and traders should remain cautious while watching the general market movement as any indication that the dip will continue in the next couple of days will hurt profits. However, playing the long game will benefit them as the token’s current position opens up $7.6 once conditions become bearable.

42390597,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd42gR,1723748812,Bitcoin Tumbles Back Under $58K as Crypto Quickly Crumbles Thursday Afternoon,"Several days of mostly quiet price action came to a fast end during U.S. trading hours Thursday afternoon, with cryptocurrencies suddenly plunging and sending bitcoin {{BTC}} to its weakest level since just after the early August market panic.  At press time, bitcoin was changing hands at $57,700, down nearly 3% from its price just about an hour earlier. Other majors saw even steeper declines, including ether {{ETH}} and solana {{SOL}}. The broad market gauge CoinDesk 20 Index was lower by 3% from 24 hours ago.  Summer 2024 has been notable for two previous panicky declines, the first of which occurred as the U.S. was enjoying its July 4 break. The catalyst for that selloff was a German government entity moving to begin selling the first of its 50,000 bitcoins which had been seized as part of a criminal probe. The second major tumble was just about two weeks ago, when what seemed like a benign rate hike by the Bank of Japan triggered a global plunge in equity markets that spread to all risk assets, crypto included.  Today's selloff, for now, appears to have no obvious catalyst. U.S. equity markets are again soaring, with the Nasdaq ahead 2.4% and the S&P 500 1.6% – both of those indices now having returned to levels seen well before the early August panic.  Ignoring good news  Bulls could be forgiven for their frustration with the recent action as the positive catalysts continue to roll in, but prices aren't responding. Catalyst number one would be the above-mentioned rally in the stock market.  The stock market rally, in part, can be attributed to what's now nearly certain to be a U.S. Federal Reserve easing cycle. Short-term interest rate markets for more than two weeks have priced in a 100% chance that the first Fed rate cut will be coming in September. While past monetary easing campaigns have proven to a boon for crypto, prices have failed to respond so far in this cycle.  Another seemingly positive catalyst would be what's become speedier institutional adoption of bitcoin. The latest batch of 13F filings (which covers the quarter ended June 30) showed 1,924 institutional holders of the spot bitcoin ETFs, according to ETF Store President Nate Geraci. That's up from 1,479 in the first quarter even as prices fell during the April to June period, noted Geraci.  And the list of publicly traded companies willing to tap capital markets to boost bitcoin holdings continues to expand. Marathon Digital (MARA) – already in the business as a bitcoin miner – this week raised $300 million in convertible debt and immediately took the funds to smash buy more than 4,000 bitcoins for about $59,000 each. Medical equipment maker Semler Scientific (SMLR) – which months ago announced its bitcoin treasury intentions – this week received approval from the SEC to move ahead with more than a $150 million capital raise, the proceeds of which will be used to buy additional tokens.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/15/bitcoin-tumbles-back-under-58k-as-crypto-quickly-crumbles-thursday-afternoon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/88596186e49bd02ce58b5666fe58575a5446eb97-5568x3712.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

32455424,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635712,1723744803,Tron Bullish Rebound At Support Level Signals Potential Upside To $0.1443,"Tron (TRX) is showing strong bullish momentum after a significant rebound at a key support level. This recent shift in momentum suggests that the $0.1443 target is now within reach. As the bullish optimism around Tron’s price continues to grow, traders are closely watching to see if the price could sustain its bullish momentum to reach the $0.1443 level. In this article, we will analyze Tron’s current price movement following the rebound at $0.1259, evaluate the significance of the $0.1443 target, and assess implications for future growth. Tron is currently trading at around $0.1321 and has increased by 1% with a market capitalization of over $11 billion and a trading volume of over $328 Million as of the time of writing. In the last 24 hours, the asset’s market cap has increased by 0.99%, while its trading volume has decreased by 18.23% Technical Indicators: Bullish Patterns Point Toward $0.1443 For Tron Currently, TRX’s price on the 4-hour chart is bullish, trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) as it heads toward the $0.1443 mark. Since rebounding from the key $0.1259 support, the digital asset has been on an upward trajectory, reflecting growing bullish momentum and the potential for further price increases. Additionally, an analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the signal line of the indicator has successfully risen above 70%, which is considered to be an overbought zone. This position suggests sustained buying pressure and increases the likelihood that the bulls could drive the price toward the $0.1443 target. After a successful rebound at the $0.1259 mark, Tron on the 1-day chart has continued to show bullish resilience while trading above the 100-day SMA. The digital asset printed multiple bullish candlesticks targeting the $0.1443 mark, indicating potential bullish sentiment for the cryptocurrency. Finally, on the 1-day chart, the RSI indicator has successfully crossed above the 50% line, approaching the 60% level. This significant crossover signifies increasing buying momentum and suggests that Tron’s price may continue its rally and greatly advance toward the $0.1443 target. Resistance Ahead: The Significance Of The $0.1443 Target Recent trading activities show that Tron with strong bullish momentum could reach the $0.2443 target. If the crypto asset reaches this level and breaks above, it could lead to a further bullish move toward the next resistance level at $0.1804 and possibly other ranges beyond. However, if bearish pressure takes over and Tron’s price fails to surpass the $0.1443 resistance level, the cryptocurrency might start to decline toward the $0.1259 support mark. Should the price fall below this support, it could potentially drop further to test the $0.1102 support level, with additional declines possible if this level is breached.

He advises investors though to hold off on accumulating BCH until the market shows clearer signs of stability. Related Reading: HODLing Resurgence? 374,000 Bitcoin Transfer Ignites Crypto Recovery The cautious outlook for Santana was based on the notion that, from his belief, the correction in the market wasn’t over yet. He indicated that BCH still might be due for a little room down to the bottom, likely to precede the bull market expected in 2025. Strategic Accumulation And Market Timing The analyst focuses on a meticulous accumulation strategy. Santana advises investors to wait for signals of the bottoming of the market before buying BCH. He says such patience can pay off handsomely. He also encourages one to look at both linear and logarithmic graphs, for each offers a different perspective into price action. This gives a greater overview of where BCH might be headed when both of them are combined. ✴️ Bitcoin Cash Pre-2025 Bull-Market Accumulation Zone & Strategy Another amazing cryptocurrency project. You know our motto, we love all cryptocurrencies; the more the better. Good evening ladies and gentlemen… Are you ready to be entertained? Bitcoin Cash peaked before… pic.twitter.com/DMLJ077ufN — Alan Santana (@lamatrades1111) August 13, 2024 Of course, these potential returns would be for those willing to follow the advice. However, he also cautioned that such gains would most likely have to travel through further declines on the market. Timing and patience in riding out wildly swinging markets are thus what seem to be emphasized more than anything else with his strategy. BCH is independent of the broad market trend. In 2021, BCH led in May, a little ahead of other altcoins. In the year 2023, BCH started off in June to peak in April 2024. This time difference right here can give BCH an added strategic advantage for investors who understand that market behavior. World Of Charts, another analyst, recently offered an upbeat prediction for Bitcoin Cash’s (BCH) price trajectory. WOC believes that BCH is almost ready for a big bounce in the upcoming weeks. BCH was trying a number of resistance levels at the time of his research. These milestones functioned as obstacles that BCH had to clear in order to pursue new annual highs. According to the analyst, a significant price gain may occur if BCH is able to overcome these resistance levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin SV Makes A Surprise Move With 10% Uptick – Details Short-Term Outlook: Resistance And Growth While Santana’s view for the long term is very conservative, the short-term BCH forecasts are pretty optimistic. CoinCheckup data interprets this to mean a possible 4.80% increase BCH over the next three months. This growth could be driven by steady accumulation and mild bullish momentum. Though modest, this could position BCH to test the $230-$240 resistance zone. Further out, the six-month outlook for BCH is a projected 14% rise. Assuming BCH can break out of its current resistance levels, the target will be the $270-$280 zone. But more so important will be how the market reacts at those levels, and that shall be the determinant as to whether BCH will keep the momentum or there will be heavy pullbacks.

Complying with MiCA means Tether may have to change its reserve management strategy, the bank said.  Tether told CoinDesk in a response that ""JP Morgan analysts seem to still have a fundamental misunderstanding about how our industry works.""  UPDATE (Aug. 15, 19:08 UTC): Updates throughout to add Tether's comments.  Increasing regulation could pose a notable challenge for Tether, issuer of the largest stablecoin, USDT, which has dominated the crypto market in recent years, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Wednesday.  A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is usually pegged to the U.S. dollar, though some other currencies and assets such as gold are also used. USDT has a market cap of about $117 billion, more than three times that of its nearest rival, Circle's USDC.  JPMorgan notes that Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation in Europe mandates that 60% of stablecoin reserves should be held with European banks.  ""Given Tether's composition of reserves, complying with MiCA's stringent requirements could necessitate significant changes to its reserve management strategy,"" analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  The stablecoin issuer has previously been subject to regulatory scrutiny due to lack of transparency about the composition of its reserves, the bank said, adding that the ""new regulations would intensify pressure on Tether to provide more detailed disclosure and audits.""  Non-compliance with these new rules could threaten Tether's dominance in the stablecoin market, the report said.  Furthermore, JPMorgan said that stablecoin legislation in the U.S. is still pending, but when it is finally introduced, most likely in 2025, adoption is expected to increase, making the cryptocurrency more mainstream.  ""U.S. compliant stablecoins stand to benefit, while non-compliant stablecoins would be challenged, potentially leading to consolidation in the industry,"" the report said.  However, Tether refuted JPMorgan's arguments and said the firm remains optimistic about how MiCA will impact the industry in the long term. ""We recognize that the effects of these regulations, which will impact every stablecoin issuer, will unfold gradually. However, certain aspects of the regulation present challenges that could complicate the role of stablecoin issuers and increase the operational risks for EU-licensed stablecoins. Tether firmly believes that stablecoin regulations must ensure safety improvements rather than posing systemic risks,"" a Tether spokesperson told CoinDesk in a statement.  The stablecoin issuer also criticized how Wall Street firms such as JPMorgan view the digital assets sector. ""JP Morgan analysts seem to still have a fundamental misunderstanding about how our industry works. Tether has been very public about our processes and risk management procedures, proving ourselves to be safer, more transparent, and more secure than recent history has shown traditional financial institutions themselves to be,"" the spokesperson said.  ""While we are sure JP Morgan is enviously looking at Tether’s profit margins and frantically attempting to catch up in the crypto space, Tether remains committed to serving its 350 million customers worldwide and shaping the future of money,"" the statement added.

32450748,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635574,1723734043,"Crypto Analyst Reveals What Could Drive The Bitcoin Price To $48,000","The Bitcoin price continues to trade sideways, as uncertainties on the macro side have made investors undecided about their next move. Crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe has provided insights into Bitcoin’s price trajectory and has raised the possibility of the crypto dropping to as low as $48,000. What Could Make Bitcoin Drop To As Low As $48,000 Van de Poppe mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin could break below $56,000 and drop to a price target of $48,000 if the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data comes out badly. Meanwhile, he added that with Bitcoin currently above $56,000, the first resistance it needs to break is between $60,000 and $61,000. He claimed that a breakout would bring Bitcoin next to its current all-time high (ATH) at $73,000. Related Reading: Dogecoin On Track To Rally 100% To $0.2; Crypto Analyst The CPI inflation data released on August 14 saw a 0.2% monthly increase in July and rose at an annual rate of 2.9%, meeting expectations. As such, it was neither considered bullish nor bearish for the market, as Bitcoin remained steady following the news. However, the positive is that the data showed inflation is slowing and that a potential interest rate cut in September is still on the table. Despite the CPI data not coming out badly, Van de Poppe’s forecast of Bitcoin dropping to as low as $48,000 could still be on the cards, seeing as the flagship crypto’s price action has looked more bearish than bullish in recent times. Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, recently mentioned that Bitcoin is more likely to fall by $5,000 rather than rise by the same amount. A $5,000 drop in Bitcoin would put it below the $56,000 resistance level Van de Poppe highlighted, putting $48,000 in sight. Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa also mentioned that Bitcoin will likely drop into the $40,000 range if it fails to break above its current price level. He added that a successful breakout will take Bitcoin to $70,000. A Strong Rally Is Coming For BTC Amid Bitcoin’s price, which is looking undecided about its next move, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto has assured us that a “strong and massive rally” is looming for the flagship crypto. He made this statement while revealing that the global liquidity index has broken out of the 2-year resistance. He noted that Bitcoin’s correlation with the global liquidity index is quite strong. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Will Rally 10,400% To $60, Here’s When The analyst, who had earlier claimed that the Bitcoin bottom was in, also recently stated that the flagship crypto’s next target as it begins its wave five expansion would be $95,000 and then $142,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $58,400, down over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42390604,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd43BD,1723734000,Crypto for Advisors: Crypto Volatility and Market Conditions,"Is crypto’s volatility a feature or a bug? In today’s issue, Miguel Kudry, CEO of L1 Advisors explores cryptocurrencies performance and its relation to market conditions.  In Ask an Expert, Kevin Tam from Raymond James Ltd. looks at institutional U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings and what they can tell advisors about adoption.  - Sarah Morton  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  In Tumultuous Times, Volatility in Crypto Is A Feature, Not A Bug  On Monday, Aug. 5, the Japanese Nikkei plunged over 12%, marking its worst crash since 1987. This followed unsettling comments from Japan's central bank about potential interest rate hikes. Some attributed the decision to fears of a possible U.S. recession, while others linked it to speculation about Federal Reserve rate cuts. This uncertainty disrupted the Japanese carry trade, a strategy estimated at $1.1 trillion by economists at TSLombard, leading to a global capital market panic as positions were unwound.  Crypto markets bore the brunt of the impact on Sunday evening as investors sought the fastest liquidity route, with bitcoin and ether experiencing dramatic drops of 15% and 22%, respectively, much of which occurred during Sunday night in U.S. Eastern Time (ET) hours.  Contrary to popular belief, the inherent volatility of crypto markets is not a bug but a feature. With no circuit breakers in place, the always-on, globally accessible nature of crypto markets often makes them the first source of liquidity for investors. In fact, during times of panic, crypto might be the only asset investors can sell, as was evident on Sunday evening in the Western Hemisphere. By the time the U.S. stock market opened on Monday morning, crypto markets had stabilized, with both bitcoin and ether recovering approximately 10% from their lows the previous night.  Crypto markets consistently provide liquidity and availability, even in the most tumultuous times. On Aug. 5, several online brokerages, including Schwab, Fidelity, Robinhood and Vanguard experienced outages or were under maintenance, leaving tens of thousands of investors unable to access their portfolios or place trades. Schwab attributed the outage to a “combination of higher volumes and a technical issue with a key vendor affecting [their] systems,” which paints a picture of traditional finance’s opaque software and backend systems. In contrast, Bitcoin has maintained 99.98918% uptime throughout its existence, and Ethereum has never gone offline, highlighting the reliability of digital assets even when traditional financial systems falter.  As other asset classes transition to crypto rails (also known as on-chain), they will benefit from the always-accessible nature of digital assets. Early adopters are likely to capitalize on arbitrage opportunities between on-chain and off-chain markets. Over time, this accessibility will become the norm for a new generation of investors who have grown disillusioned with traditional markets. A recent Bank of America report highlights this shift, noting that “older investors hold significantly more traditional equities, while younger groups hold more crypto and alternative investments.”  During times of uncertainty, the increased availability and accessibility of an investor’s portfolio can lead to reduced volatility and panic across all asset classes, including crypto-native tokens. An analysis by Amberdata highlights that “the dispersion of volatility across different regions underscores the significant impact of market openings and closings on price movements.” This suggests that greater accessibility could help stabilize markets during critical periods, providing a buffer against extreme fluctuations.  Earlier this year, as geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel escalated, PAXG, a tokenized version of gold, traded at a 20% premium over its closing price on Friday, April 12. These sharp price swings reflect the stark differences in flexibility between traditional and crypto or on-chain markets. This volatility is evident in PAXG's trading volumes, which typically peak over weekends and particularly on Sundays, highlighting the dynamic nature of crypto markets compared to more rigid traditional markets.  Source: @Kaledora, who wrote a whole X thread on this subject.  In conclusion, the inherent volatility of crypto markets and on-chain assets, especially during tumultuous times, underscores the unique characteristics that set them apart from traditional markets and off-chain assets. The always-on nature, free from circuit breakers, ensures that crypto markets remain accessible even when traditional markets falter, offering liquidity when it's needed most. As more assets transition to on-chain rails, this availability will become increasingly vital, potentially reducing panic and volatility across the broader global financial ecosystem.  - Miguel Kudry, CEO, L1 Advisors  Ask an Expert  Q. How can investors use the SEC 13F or SEDAR filings for due diligence?  As a research tool, investors can gain insights into the investment strategies and holdings of large institutional managers (“smart money”). To help identify successful strategies, spot any market trends and where funds are allocating capital. From a regulatory compliance perspective, this may boost investor confidence by increasing the transparent and integrity of the TradFi markets.  In Canada, SEDAR (System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval) in Canada is similar to EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) in the USA. Both systems serve as electronic filing platforms for publicly traded companies to submit their financial and other regulatory documents. I tend to think of this like a permissionless and open ledger, similar to a blockchain network.  Q. Why would a pension fund or bank add bitcoin to their portfolio?  This signifies a shift towards embracing digital assets as part of their investment strategy. This move can be seen as a response to low interest rates and inflation concerns while providing diversification and some better returns. For example, the State of Michigan Retirement System added $6.5 million in Ark 21Shares bitcoin ETF in Q2.  Additionally, Canadian banks like TD Waterhouse Canada, CIBC World Markets and National Bank all have included bitcoin ETFs in their latest Q2 13F filing. All the big banks hold some position in these spot bitcoin ETFs. In the last two quarters, the banks collectively own a total of $26.6 million.  I do believe bitcoin is a long-duration, institutional-grade asset and can provide asymmetric return profiles that maintain significant upside potential while limiting downside risk.  Q. What’s the latest buzz around spot bitcoin and spot ethereum ETF?  ETFs have become available in early 2024 and have become very popular with money flowing into them. Currently, total fund assets amount to around $62.3 billion held with the 10 spot bitcoin ETFs.  In July, the spot Ethereum ETF became available, making it easier for everyone to invest in these digital assets through the traditional financial market. In the short few weeks, the spot Ethereum ETF saw a total net inflow of $17 billion with the eight ETFs.  All this marks a significant evolution in digital asset investing, especially with the introduction of ETF products, enhancing accessibility and legitimacy for all investors.  - Kevin Tam, Digital Asset Research Specialist & Senior Branch Compliance Supervisor, Raymond James Ltd.

42390594,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd42Lv,1723732077,Stablecoins Can Make the World a Safer Place. Regulators Should Encourage Them,"In 1974, German regulators liquidated Herstatt Bankbecause it was unable to settle its foreign exchange obligations. Time zone differences and a lack of global settlement technology led to its demise. In the aftermath of this and other bank failures, central bankers formed the Basel Committee on Banking Supervisionthat same year to set standards for bank capital, liquidity and funding.  Fifty years later, “Herstatt” risk is synonymous with foreign exchange settlement risk, and the Basel Committee has become a powerful forum for global bank supervision because of the regulatory capital standards it sets. Its Basel Rules are designed to ensure that banks are sufficiently capitalized based on the underlying risks of their activities.  However, across the $7.5 trillion a dayglobal foreign exchange markets,Herstatt risk remains. While the financial services industry has sought to modernize its infrastructure, many currencies still take as long as two days to settle. And across the $700 trillion derivatives market, lumbering daily batch settlement processes fail to keep pace with the real time volatility of the markets that they seek to collateralize.  But breakthroughs in technology have the potential to banish settlement risk to a thing of the past. There’s a crucial role for blockchain technology to play. Stablecoins, tokens designed to be pegged to an underlying currency and settled on blockchains, can now reduce currency settlement latency from days to a matter of seconds.  The global financial system will be better off if stablecoins are fully adopted and Herstatt risk goes the way of the dinosaurs  Stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency, are not without risk. Unregulated stablecoins have “de-pegged” in the past because of design flaws or the failure of traditional banks that held their fiat reserves. But, strong policies and thoughtful regulations that require transparency and minimum reserve asset standards mitigate these risks. Bank insolvency risk — an issue stemming from traditional, not cryptocurrency markets — can be reduced through more effective capital standards, diversification or policies that allow for the bankruptcy remoteness of stablecoin reserves.  Stablecoin policies and regulations are now coming online. Last month, the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation went live in the European Union, and its regulatory framework for stablecoins is now in effect. While the U.S. is still formulating its national approach, major jurisdictions including the U.K. and Singapore have also initiated stablecoin regulations of their own.  Properly regulated and backed by quality reserves, stablecoins — with their instant and simultaneous settlement on blockchains — reduce counterparty risk because obligations are satisfied immediately. From payments to collateral to foreign exchange markets, this undoubtedly improves the safety and soundness of the global financial system. Clearly, today’s foreign-exchange settlement system is in dire need of a technology overhaul, and regulations should incentivize the adoption of technologies, like stablecoins, that mitigate risk.  Last month, the Basel Committee published a framework describing how stablecoins can achieve “preferential” capital treatment. But, to the Basel Committee, this means that projects achieving these standards will simply receive the same capital treatment as the underlying fiat currency tokenized by the stablecoin.  The Basel Committee should go further by actually offering improved capital treatment for products that reduce systemic risk — even those on public blockchains. And the capital regime does not have to be tied to specific technology like stablecoins, but rather to the settlement risk of the underlying asset. With regulated stablecoins now on the scene, preferential capital rules — which drive bank behavior — would compel market participants to improve their technology and strengthen the system.  The banking sector and the global financial system will be better off if stablecoins, settled over blockchains, are fully adopted and Herstatt risk goes the way of the dinosaurs. It’s time for regulators to actually incentivize their use.

42390588,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd41gt,1723730819,Stablecoin Supply Growth Isn't Eating Into Crypto Market Share: JPMorgan,"Stablecoin growth is a reflection of an increase in total crypto market cap following gains in bitcoin and ether this year, the report said.  The bank noted that stablecoin market share as a percentage of the total crypto market cap is little changed.  The launch of new products and regulatory clarity in Europe have helped attract investors to the stablecoin space, JPMorgan said.  Stablecoin supply has been growing in U.S. dollar terms, but the expansion doesn't mean it's taking over crypto market share; rather, it is mainly an indication of the increase in total digital asset market cap, JPMorgan (JPM) said in a research report on Wednesday.  A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that's normally pegged to the U.S. dollar, though some other currencies and assets such as gold are also used.  There has been ""little change in the stablecoin market share as a percentage of total crypto crypto market cap,"" analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.  The bank noted that total stablecoin market cap has rebounded to $165 billion, nearing the previous high of $180 billion, which was witnessed before the Terra/Luna collapse.  There are a number of reasons for this stablecoin market growth.  The large gains in prices of bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} this year have triggered an increase in crypto market cap which has led to growth in the supply of stablecoins as these tokens ""serve as collateral in crypto lending/borrowing and other crypto transactions,"" the report said.  Investors have been increasingly using stablecoins to access the crypto markets following the launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. in January, the bank noted. These cryptocurrencies have also seen more demand from the traditional finance world.

32449206,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635690,1723730421,Crypto Guru Arthur Hayes Bets On This Under-The-Radar Altcoin,"Arthur Hayes, a well-known crypto investor and former CEO of BitMEX, has reportedly made a major purchase of the little-known altcoin Aethir (ATH), amounting to 11.4 million tokens, valued at approximately $779,000. This transaction was identified and reported by on-chain data analytics firm Lookonchain. According to the firm, the purchase was made on crypto exchange OKX. Shortly after Hayes’ acquisition, another purchase was reportedly made by a whale. A different anonymous investor acquired 28.87 million ATH, worth around $1.95 million, across multiple exchanges including Bybit, KuCoin, and OKX, as per data by Lookonchain. Related Reading: Ethereum Price To Hit New All-Time High If This Happens: Crypto Analyst This flurry of activity comes just three days after Hayes’ recent forecast in his latest essay, suggesting a potential upswing in the crypto market beginning in September 2024. Hayes stated, “In any case, I expect that crypto will exit its sideways-to-downward trajectory starting in September. As such, I will take advantage of this late northern hemispheric summer weakness to load up on crypto risk.” Hayes didn’t name any specific altcoins he’s buying, but seemingly Aethir (ATH) is one of them. Discussing the broader market, Hayes expressed his anticipation for a resurgence in altcoins, contingent upon major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether breaking significant price barriers. He remarked, “Alt szn will return only after Bitcoin and Ether decidedly break through $70,000 and $4,000, respectively. The combination of a dollar liquidity-inspired Bitcoin and Ether rally into year-end will create a strong foundation for the return of a sexy shitcoin soiree.” Crypto Newcomer: What Is Aethir (ATH)? The Aethir (ATH) token is the native cryptocurrency of the Aethir network, integral to its decentralized GPU cloud infrastructure. ATH operates as a utility and governance token within the Aethir ecosystem, which is focused on providing decentralized cloud solutions for AI and gaming through its Distributed Proof of Infrastructure (DePIN) technology. Related Reading: Dogecoin On Track To Rally 100% To $0.2; Crypto Analyst ATH tokens have several key uses. ATH is used to pay for services like renting GPU resources for AI processing and cloud gaming. Token holders can vote on various proposals affecting the network’s future. Moreover, ATH rewards participants in the network, particularly those who operate Checker Nodes and contribute GPU power through devices like the Aethir Edge. The Aethir network emphasizes community participation and decentralization, aiming to distribute ATH tokens widely via mechanisms like airdrops and earning opportunities through the Aethir Cloud Drop campaign. This campaign allows community members to earn ATH by participating in activities that support network growth and engagement. The token has a circulating supply of approximately 4.056 billion units, with a market cap of around $276 million. Thus, ATH is only the 215th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. In the last 24 hours, trading volume is quite elevated with $91.15 million, although it’s down -63%, ATH volume is still ranked 56th (24h). At press time, ATH traded at $0.068059, down -4.6% in the last 24 hours.

The fundraising was led by venture capital firm Haun Ventures.  Chaos Labs, a New York crypto startup known for its suite of on-chain risk management tools, has raised $55 million in a Series A funding round led by the venture capital firm Haun Ventures.  The influx of capital comes as Chaos Labs, founded in 2021, looks to expand its platform, designed to address the growing need for automated risk management in decentralized finance (DeFi).  The project has tripled its customer base in the past year, helping more than 20 protocols including Aave, GMX and Jupiter to secure, monitor and grow their products, according to a statement.  The funding round attracted a mix of familiar faces and new backers, with participants including F-Prime Capital, Slow Ventures and Spartan Capital, alongside larger investors like Lightspeed Venture Partners, Galaxy Ventures and PayPal Ventures. Chaos Labs was also backed by angel investors such as Solana’s Anatoly Yakovenko and Phantom’s Francesco Agosti.  While DeFi protocols continue to grow in popularity, their susceptibility to market volatility and risk remains top-of-mind for many investors, particularly those from the traditional financial world. Chaos Labs is positioning itself as a key player in tackling these challenges by offering real-time data and risk assessment tools, areas where DeFi tends to lag behind centralized finance.  DeFi platforms – like on-chain lending markets and futures exchanges – are subject to similar risk considerations as legacy financial services: When market conditions change, DeFi platforms need to update certain parameters, like collateral requirements and liquidation ratios, to keep customers safe.  But even in the ""decentralized"" world of blockchains, the task of managing risk is frequently offloaded to companies or select individuals, which can cause errors and slowdowns – not to mention centralization concerns.  ""Today, all applications on DeFi on-chain are basically static and have stale parameter configuration,"" said Omer Goldberg, Founder and CEO at Chaos Labs. ""On average, it takes 72 to 96 hours from the moment that a risk manager detects that changes needed to be made until they're actually propagated on-chain.""  Chaos Labs – with its dashboards, real-time data oracles, risk alerts and other tools – aims to automate certain risk management tasks to make DeFi platforms more responsive to market volatility, and less susceptible to human error.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/08/15/chaos-labs-raises-55m-as-demand-grows-for-on-chain-risk-management,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eb38694b752bc417bd9690a12d65cdc452789e8f-2636x1756.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

32447630,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635601,1723728602,Bitwise CIO Reveals Three Super Bullish Signals From Bitcoin ETFs,"Despite the muted performance of Bitcoin in recent months, the 13-F filings for the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) paint a bullish picture for the BTC price. Bitwise Chief Investment Officer (CIO) Matt Hougan has shared a recap of the three most interesting takeaways from the Q2 filings via X. His findings underscore a growing and sustained institutional interest in Bitcoin, pointing towards an bullish outlook. #1 Increased Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Hougan highlights an impressive rise in institutional engagement with Bitcoin ETFs during the second quarter of the year. He reported, “I count 1,924 holder ETF pairs across all 10 ETFs, up from 1,479 in Q1. That’s a 30% increase; not bad considering prices fell in Q2.” This data suggests that institutional investors are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a viable asset class, even amidst price declines, indicating a long-term commitment rather than speculative short-term plays. Related Reading: Unveiling The Strategic Advantages Of A Bitcoin Reserve For The US Economy Hougan concludes, “Of course, this does not mean 1,924 institutions own bitcoin ETFs; some investors report positions in multiple ETFs. But that “double-counting” aspect is equally true of the Q1 and Q2 numbers, so the percentage increase is still telling. My takeaway: Institutional investors continued to adopt bitcoin ETFs in Q2. The trend is intact.” #2 Institutional Investors Are HODLers The holding patterns within these filings reveal that a substantial portion of institutional investors remained committed to their Bitcoin ETF holdings, reflecting a resilient stance against the market’s volatility. “Among Q1 filers, 44% increased their position in bitcoin ETFs in Q2, 22% held steady, 21% decreased their position, and 13% exited,” said Hougan. These figures are particularly telling because they demonstrate that more than two-thirds of the institutions either maintained or increased their exposure to Bitcoin ETFs during a period of significant price fluctuations. Hougan interprets this data as a sign that institutional investors possess “diamond hands,” a colloquial term used within the community to describe holders who do not sell their holdings despite pressure or market downturns. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Set To Surge With $2.5 Billion Stablecoin Inflows: Research Firm Hougan added, “If you thought institutional investors would panic at the first sign of volatility, the data suggest otherwise. They’re pretty steady.” #3 Broad Investor Base The analysis by Hougan also highlights the diverse array of investors participating in Bitcoin ETFs. Major hedge funds like Millennium, Schonfeld, Boothbay, and Capula are prominently featured among the top holders. However, the presence of advisors, family offices, and other institutional investors such as the State of Wisconsin is particularly notable. “ETFs are a big tent that attract a wide variety of investors. It’s kind of great to see Millennium nestled up against the State of Wisconsin in these ETF filings. Over time, I’d like to see wealth managers and pensions account for a growing share,” Hougan remarked. Yesterday it became public that the Wisconsin Pension Fund has increased its Bitcoin ETF holdings. In an SEC filing, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board reported owning 2,898,051 shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust as of June 30 (worth $98.9 million as of that date). This is an increase from the 2,450,400 shares Wisconsin had previously reported in May. At press time, BTC traded at $58,035.

While FDIG is one of the better-performing ETFs in its category, it suffers from a high expense ratio (0.39%) and a steep bid/ask spread (0.88%), making it an inefficient choice. For investors looking to outperform Bitcoin, I recommend MicroStrategy, which has historically outperformed during bull markets. For broader blockchain exposure, buy FDIG’s top 10 holdings directly. FDIG follows a stricter approach to selecting cryptocurrency-related companies, but the fund’s concentration in a few names, especially Bitcoin miners, raises questions about it as a tool to overperform the crypto market. I rate FDIG a “HOLD” for those who already own it due to tax and spread considerations, but recommend looking elsewhere for better exposure to the crypto and blockchain space. Thesis: there are better options than FDIG for investors interested in crypto and blockchain The Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF ( FDIG ) was launched, along with several peers, during the 2021 Crypto bull market. I believe Fidelity introduced this fund to capitalize on the crypto-mania of the time. My belief is supported by the limited marketing material available for FDIG, as well as its relatively high expense ratio and bid/ask spread, at 0.39% and 0.88%, respectively. From an investor's perspective, I see little reason to choose this fund for exposure to the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. For investors looking to outperform Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, I believe MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ) is a better option. Historically, MicroStrategy has outperformed Bitcoin during bull markets, benefits from a growing BTC per share metric, and doesn’t charge any fees, as I discussed in a recent article . On the other hand, investors seeking broader exposure to the cryptocurrency space might be better off purchasing some of FDIG's top 10 holdings directly. These holdings represent more than 50% of the fund at the time of writing and would allow investors to avoid the high expenses associated with FDIG. Overall, I rate this ETF a HOLD if it’s already in your portfolio, as selling it would create a taxable event and require going through the high bid/ask spread. However, investors interested in crypto and blockchain exposure should consider other options. FDIG ETF profile: this is not an efficient fund, in my view The FDIG ETF tracks the Fidelity Crypto Industry & Digital Payments Index. According to its issuer, this index is designed to: reflect the performance of global companies engaged in cryptocurrency, related blockchain technology and digital payments processing. The index operates with the following logic: It selects Crypto Industry stocks that derive at least 50% of their revenue from cryptocurrency and related blockchain technology activities. These companies will collectively make up at least 60% of the index's weight. It then selects the top 20 Digital Payments stocks, which must also derive at least 50% of their revenue from digital payments processing activities, based on average daily trading volume. Stocks are weighted according to their daily trading volume, adhering to diversification rules, and capped at the lesser of 22.5% of the index weight or the maximum weight that can support a $20M flow. Top 10 Holdings, FDIG (Seeking Alpha) Looking at the top 10 holdings of the FDIG ETF, I see names that I am sure will be familiar to readers that are interested in the cryptocurrency space. These include Coinbase Global ( COIN ) — the leading cryptocurrency exchange operating as an intermediary for most Bitcoin ETFs — and Bitcoin miners such as Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ), which I have covered in a recent article . With its top 10 holdings representing 53.52% of the ETF, I find this fund fairly concentrated, especially accounting for the fact that more than 25% of the holdings are either Bitcoin miners or crypto trading platforms. The ETF has a yearly expense ratio of 0.39%. I find this ratio reasonable given the somewhat exotic nature of this product. This is further confirmed by comparing FDIG’s expense ratio with competitive funds that I will cover in the next section of this article. However, in my view, a 0.39% expense ratio for a passive fund is too expensive in general, especially given how concentrated this ETF is. I will cover why I do not see passive funds as a good way to get exposed to crypto in the next sections. What I like the least about this ETF is its very high bid/ask spread, which currently sits at 0.88% according to Seeking Alpha data. This bid/ask spread is far higher than the Median of all ETFs reported by Seeking Alpha, at 0.15%. This is incredibly expensive when compared to the bid/ask spread of more liquid crypto ETFs such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), at 0.03%. The high bid/ask spread is also the main reason why I believe this ETF is not an efficient way to get exposed to its underlying stocks. Having to pay close to 1% as a purchase fee in the form of bid/ask spread, as well as 0.39% per year to hold a somewhat concentrated fund is not efficient, in my view. The other reason why I do not like this ETF has to do with its index’s investment logic and underlying investment thesis, something I will cover later in this article, together with what, I think, are better alternatives for investors. FDIG: best option among a set of subpar funds I believe the FIDG ETF is part of a set of funds that were launched by issuers to capitalize on the cryptocurrency bull-run that took place in 2021. These are the Grayscale Future of Finance ETF ( GFOF ), the Global X Blockchain & Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITS ), the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF ( BLOK ), the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF ( BITQ ) and the iShares Blockchain and Tech ETF ( IBLC ). FDIG vs. peers, key figures (Author's elaboration of Seeking Alpha data) The table above summarizes key financial figures for each of these ETFs. By far, the largest and more liquid ETFs in the set are BLOK and BITQ. However, both of these ETFs have an expense ratio that is more than double that of FDIG. Given that an expense ratio is charged annually, and assuming investors in these illiquid funds are not engaging in frequent trading, I consider these funds sub-par. In other words, as an investor, I would prefer to pay a higher fee in the form of a bid/ask spread—incurred only once when buying and once when selling—rather than an expensive recurring yearly fee. These ETFs all share a common focus on investing in cryptocurrency-related companies, but they do not invest directly in cryptocurrency. The difference lies in how each fund defines “cryptocurrency-related” companies. Broadly speaking, there are two approaches these ETFs have taken: A strict approach, selecting only companies that generate the majority of their revenue from cryptocurrency-related activities. A more lax approach, including companies that are involved in or have committed to the blockchain and crypto space, but still derive most of their revenue and profit from other activities. FDIG follows the first, stricter approach. This is unlike the most liquid of its peers, BLOK, which features more variety in its top holdings. Among the top holdings of the BLOK ETF, we can find PayPal Holdings ( PYPL ), weighting 3.45% of the fund, as well as Block ( SQ ), with a weight of 3.33%. The difference in the investment universe is reflected in the performance of these ETFs in the past 3 years, outlined in the chart below. FDIG vs. peers, performance (Seeking Alpha) FDIG is the second best performing ETF of the set, after IBLC. I, personally, prefer the investment approach of FDIG against the more “lax” approach of products such as BLOK because I find the fact the ETF is more narrowly focused on the crypto space as an advantage. However, IBLC is over-performing while having a more lax approach, with PayPal and Mastercard ( MA ) in its top 10 holdings. I believe this indicates that either approach has its merits, but I still do not see a fundamental reason why an investor should be exposed to any of these ETFs. I will cover FDIG’s unconvincing investment thesis in the next section. An Unconvincing Investment Thesis: Better Alternatives to FDIG When analyzing an ETF, I always start by putting myself in the shoes of the issuer and the potential investors who are being targeted. I have not found good marketing material from Fidelity about the FDIG ETF. Its fact sheet , for example, does not mention any reason why investors should consider this fund, rather focusing on describing how the product operates. FDIG also does not have a dedicated web page on Fidelity’s website. The fund is only briefly mentioned on this page as part of the issuer’s cryptocurrency related offering. Personally, I have come to the conclusion that there are two logical reasons why an investor should buy the FDIG ETF. First, because of expectations that cryptocurrency and blockchain-related companies will over-perform Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies themselves. Second, because of the expectation that a more diversified investment in cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology might be less risky, given how fast this space can evolve. I believe there are better alternatives for either of these two investment thesis. In case investors are looking for over-performing Bitcoin, I think MicroStrategy is a better choice. MicroStrategy has historically over-performed Bitcoin in times of bull market, being valued at up to 5 times its Bitcoin holdings. I wrote a recent article about MSTR and how I believe that if you can stomach high volatility, this is a better investment than Bitcoin itself. In case investors want to diversify and gain wide exposure to Blockchain as a technology, I think they would be better off buying the top 10 holdings of FDIG, which together make more than 50% of the fund. This would have the benefit of saving them the 0.39% expense ratio, as well as now having to pay the rich bid/ask spread. On top, investors could benefit from avoiding some less desirable companies that are currently in this ETF. For example, the FDIG ETF is exposed to a wide array of Bitcoin Miners. However, I think leading Bitcoin miners such as Marathon Digital Holdings are more desirable than smaller players, based on their stocks’ historical performance. While I do recognize that the latter approach would make the investment less diversified, I believe this is still preferable than buying an inefficient fund such as FDIG. My belief is rooted in the fact that I think investing in cryptocurrency is not as easy as investing broadly into diversified equities. Investing in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space is not something I would recommend to investors that are not willing to inform themselves about this space. In this regard, I do not think having a passive fund doing their work for you is not a suitable strategy, given the high volatility and fast pace of the crypto and blockchain industry. Another option rather than buying FDIG is to simply hold Bitcoin and Ethereum, using one of the recently approved ETFs for each of the two. This approach is even less diversified. However, it is straightforward, more efficient in terms of expenses, and still provides investors the broad exposure to crypto, given these are the two leading blockchains in the space at the moment. Risks to my thesis The main risk to my thesis concerns diversification. I am recommending investors not to invest in FDIG, but rather prefer more concentrated positions in Bitcoin, MicroStrategy or the top 10 holdings of this ETF. If one or more of the other 29 holdings of this ETF were to mature into a global leader in the crypto space, this ETF could over-perform my recommendation. The benefits from a company vastly over-performing all others could more than compensate for investors avoiding the high expense ratio and the rich bid/ask spread of this ETF. To note, I think the risk of this scenario materializing is minimal because the diversification of this ETF is not great. The BLOK or IBLC ETFs, for example, have 53 and 44 holdings respectively against FDIG’s 39, and include big names such as PayPal and IBM among their holdings. Furthermore, I believe that it is fundamentally very difficult to identify the next “winners” in any space, and especially in the crypto space. I also do not think that a passive fund is the correct tool for stock picking. Nevertheless, the risk that a less diversified crypto portfolio will have potential investors underperforming FDIG exists, and must be considered. Conclusion I see the Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF as the best among a set of ETFs that are not an efficient way to invest in cryptocurrencies. While better than peers, FDIG still has a very high expense ratio and a significant bid/ask spread, at 0.88%. I do not think these high fees justify the strategy behind this passive fund. Thus, I do not expect this ETF to be able to beat the broader cryptocurrency market, even if it’s fairly diversified. I believe investors who want to try and over perform the market should opt for holding MicroStrategy. Investors that want a more diversified approach should simply buy the top 10 holdings of this fund, which make up more than 50% of it. I rate the FDIG ETF a “HOLD”: if you have it in your portfolio, I see no benefit in selling it. That’s because of capital gain tax considerations, as well as avoiding the rich bid/ask spread. If you have no exposure to this ETF, my recommendation is to look elsewhere to get into the cryptocurrency and blockchain space.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4714805-fdig-best-choice-among-flawed-crypto-etfs?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32448128.jpeg

42390587,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd41r9,1723725900,"Wall Street Agrees Crypto Is 'Clearly' A Huge Election Issue, But Still Divided on Who Is Best for Industry","Wall Street firms with an interest in crypto agree that crypto has become a critical component in politics these days but whether a Trump or Harris Administration would be better for the industry is still unclear.  Some believe that former president Donald Trump would be the favorable choice for companies in the industry given his engagement with leaders. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, on the other hand, has yet to make her stance public.  The digital assets industry is now a full-blown political issue, and Wall Street firms with crypto exposure are staying cautious ahead of November's U.S. election.  Whether the next election will result in Donald Trump or Kamala Harris occupying the Oval Office for the next four years, one thing Wall Street firms agree on is that either nominee will bring crypto regulation forward.  Former President Donald Trump has recently begun courting the crypto industry, promising to install friendly regulators and suggesting the U.S. maintain a Bitcoin reserve during last month's BTC Nashville conference. He also promised to fire the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, though it's unclear how he'd do that.  Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, on the other hand, has so far been quiet on the issue.  “Although she has yet to make her position on crypto clear, her past affiliations suggest a potentially cautious approach,” CoinShares analyst Max Shannon wrote in a report.  Two Wall Street firms who are issuers of both spot bitcoin {{BTC}} and spot ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) – VanEck and 21Shares – are betting on a Trump administration to take office in January. Both firms have filed to introduce a spot Solana {{SOL}} ETF in the U.S. and are waiting for SEC's approval.  “Based on what we’ve seen so far about possible personnel appointments, a Harris Presidency might be even worse for US-based digital asset entrepreneurs than Biden,” said Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck.  “That this administration is winning antitrust lawsuits against Big Tech while attacking open-source alternatives is illogical and fails to protect the consumer welfare that regulators are entrusted with safeguarding,” he said.  As the vice president to President Joe Biden, Harris is often associated with her party’s current stance and enforcement actions against cryptocurrencies. However, many Democrats have shown signs that they disagree with their president, for example when 32 of them joined Republicans in supporting a bill that would rethink how the SEC views digital assets.  'Real issue'  As with any campaign promise made by politicians, it is unclear whether Harris will form a positive or negative stance regarding the industry and whether Trump will follow through on his promises.  “A more balanced approach to crypto could set Vice President Harris apart from the Biden administration’s more critical stance, aligning her with Democrats who are advocating for positive crypto legislation,” CoinShares’ Shannon argued.  Wall Street asset management giant Franklin Templeton says there are constructive signals from both sides on what the future holds.  “One thing that’s clear is that crypto seems to be at a scale and importance level where it is a real issue in politics nowadays, you can’t just sweep it under the rug, and that is exciting to see,” said Christopher Jensen, head of digital assets at Franklin.  A report from brokerage firm Bernstein on Tuesday said that market sentiment suggests that a second term for Trump would be bullish for crypto markets whereas a Harris win would bearish.  The reason behind this assessment is the weakness in the price of bitcoin following the shift in odds on crypto-based prediction platform Polymarket in favor of Harris. Bettors on the website currently predict a 53% chance of Harris winning the election in November while Trump’s odds stand at 45%.",NEUTRAL,BTC | SOL,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | SOL | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/news-analysis/2024/08/15/wall-street-agrees-crypto-is-clearly-a-huge-election-issue-but-divided-on-who-is-best-for-industry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac2fe10f3475415836ac30def7147147eb284495-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390596,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd42WB,1723725228,Top Crypto Startup Drove Other Projects' Airdrops to Its Employees,"Eigen Labs, the developer of ""restaking"" juggernaut EigenLayer, distributed a list of employee wallet addresses to ecosystem projects preparing to launch crypto tokens.  Some teams said they asked Eigen Labs for the list, but one said it didn't and felt pressured by the company to send its employees tokens.  Experts and insiders say the payouts – worth nearly $5 million at peak prices – raise conflict-of-interest concerns.  Eigen Labs and the nonprofit Eigen Foundation have since banned such payouts to employees.  Transparent blockchains were pitched as an antidote to Wall Street-style backroom deals. They've instead paved the way for a new class of insiders.  Many regard EigenLayer as one of the most promising projects in the sprawling Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. The app provides what it calls a ""credibly neutral"" platform for building blockchain apps and keeping them safe from theft and cyberattacks.  Such neutrality, however, comes with a major caveat: Employees at Eigen Labs, the company behind EigenLayer, have accepted millions of dollars in payouts from some of the other projects that rely on its technology, raising the question of potential conflicts of interest, a CoinDesk investigation found.  One team told CoinDesk that it sent each Eigen Labs employee a portion of its new cryptocurrency as a “thank you.” Each employee’s allocation was eventually worth $80,000.  Another team said it was sent a list of wallet addresses by Eigen Labs and felt pressured to pay up – or risk imperiling the relationship with a company that could make or break its business.  Eigen Labs employees ultimately claimed payouts worth nearly $5 million at peak values – just under $1 million at press time – amid the crypto market's summer slump. Some of the highest-ranking employees who claimed tokens now work at the Eigen Foundation, a non-profit that awards grants to projects that use EigenLayer's technology.  Eigen Labs and the Eigen Foundation quietly banned payouts to their employees this year, acknowledging the practice might create conflicts of interest, or at least the impression of them.  ""Eigen Labs and its Foundation are stated to be 'credibly neutral,' implying a responsibility to avoid any appearance of bias or preferential treatment,"" said Cessiah Lopez, a crypto research fellow at the nonprofit VentureESG and affiliate researcher at the Minderoo Centre for Technology & Democracy at the University of Cambridge. ""Actions that could be interpreted as contradicting this principle might raise concerns, even if they were undertaken without any malicious intent.""  Airdrop assistance  Founded by Sreeram Kannan, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Washington, EigenLayer helped spark crypto’s most recent boom cycle in 2023 when it pioneered ""restaking,” a new kind of blockchain security technology that doubled as a lucrative investment opportunity.  The platform raised more than $100 million in venture funding and racked up $15 billion worth of user deposits in under a year – massive sums even in the big-money world of blockchain.  Read more: Restaking 101: What Are Restaking, Liquid Restaking and EigenLayer?  More than a dozen blockchain apps rushed to launch on EigenLayer in early 2024 – things like cloud compute services and data storage platforms. Also joining the wave were ""liquid restaking"" services that made depositing into EigenLayer more user-friendly.  The new apps chewed up millions of dollars in venture funding and spat out cryptocurrencies with sometimes billion-dollar valuations. They held airdrops to distribute their new tokens.  As this was happening, Eigen Labs was helping its employees get access to the airdrops. It sent around a list of their wallet addresses – crypto's answer to the bank account.  The company insists it did so only when asked by those projects.  ""For projects interested in airdropping to Eigen Labs, we provided a list of addresses for all Eigen Labs employees,"" the company said in a statement to CoinDesk.  Eigen Labs only sent the list ""to teams that had reached out about airdropping to Eigen Labs or its employees,"" reiterated Alan Curtis, the company's chief commercial officer.  But one team told CoinDesk that Eigen Labs sent it the list even though it had not asked for it.  Eigen Labs requested that its employees be rewarded with airdrops, said the developer of this project, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. The request was difficult to ignore given Eigen Labs' influence, the person said.  Eigen Labs said it helped many teams coordinate sending airdrops to others in the restaking ecosystem by amassing wallet address lists and making introductions.  ""This was (and is) very much aligned with our vision of a coordination engine where projects help each other, reward each other, and partner to build an EigenLayer ecosystem that is greater than the sum of its parts,"" the company said in a statement, though it banned the payouts to its own employees in May.  Following the money  CoinDesk reverse-engineered the wallet list by compiling a list of all Eigen Labs employees and pairing them with wallets and non-fungible token-holdings they had disclosed on social media.  A pattern began to emerge.  These wallets – and other ""burner"" addresses that often only interacted with crypto exchanges – were collecting the same number of tokens from three respective airdrops: Ether.Fi, Renzo and AltLayer.  CoinDesk later verified a majority sample of this reverse-engineered list with insiders familiar with the actual Eigen Labs list.  According to CoinDesk's analysis, AltLayer allocated 46,512 ALT to each Eigen Labs employee. Ether.Fi followed with 10,490.9 ETHFI per person. Then came Renzo, at 66,667 REZ apiece. At peak prices these three airdrops were worth around $30,000, $80,000, and $16,666, respectively.  On-chain records indicate Eigen Labs employees claimed a total of 487,928 ETHFI (peak value $3.5 million), 1,733,342 REZ (peak $433,300), and 1,539,563 ALT (peak $1.02 million) between late January and mid-June 2024.  'A very weird crypto thing'  Some industry sources who spoke to CoinDesk said the airdrops to Eigen Labs employees amounted to business as usual in crypto: a common, albeit seldom openly discussed perk of working for a well-connected blockchain startup.  ""It's a very weird crypto thing where, like, people just give out free money every once in a while,"" said Mike Silagadze, CEO of Ether.Fi.  Ether.Fi airdropped tokens to employees of many companies, including Eigen Labs, as a ""thank you,"" he said.  Silagadze said Ether.Fi preferred to airdrop tokens to individuals at those companies ""because it's more personal"" than sending them to the firms. He said he asked Eigen Labs for a list of its employees so they could get airdrops. It sent him a list of 50 wallet addresses, no names.  ""They did specifically say that Sreeram did not participate in this,"" Silagadze said, referring to Kannan, Eigen Labs' CEO. ""Given the size of the team it was probably everyone else.""  (Bullish, the parent company of CoinDesk, is an investor in Ether.fi)  Others said the payments by various teams to Eigen Labs employees were improper. One crypto protocol founder who was aware of the Eigen Labs payments, but spoke on the condition of anonymity, said they amounted to an “abuse of power.”  “If a company gives another company tokens for business reasons, that’s one thing, but giving tokens to individual team members is completely out of the norm — even in crypto,” said the founder.  In this person's view, Eigen Labs' outsized influence in the restaking world means it can selectively promote or privilege projects that pay tokens to team members.  Eigen Labs frequently highlights projects on its social media channels and has hosted invitation-only networking events – like a Colorado ski weekend after this year's ethDenver conference – for ecosystem founders.  The Eigen Foundation controls 15% of all EIGEN tokens and rewards grants to projects in the EigenLayer ecosystem.  CoinDesk found no evidence that Eigen Labs or Eigen Foundation used its power to privilege projects that paid tokens to its employees.  A lack of norms  Compared to government-regulated public companies, private crypto startups have a lot of leeway in deciding how they disclose critical information such as token ownership percentages.  When a crypto project issues tokens, it often publishes a rough breakdown of beneficiaries. No one's requiring there to be a pie chart; the crypto industry lacks consistent reporting standards, leaving investors with incomplete or even misleading information about digital assets.  ""Token holders are functionally the public [equity] market here,"" said Christos Makridis, who is conducting research on airdrops as a digital fellow at Stanford University's Digital Economy Lab. In stock markets ""there are reporting requirements"" designed to keep investors safe, he pointed out. In crypto, none of this is codified.  AltLayer was the only project to proactively disclose its distribution to the Eigen Labs team in a January blog post. AltLayer Head of Communications Aparna Narayanan told CoinDesk the allocations were a ""token of appreciation.”  By contrast, Renzo and Ether.fi disclosed in their tokenomics web pages that some of their airdrops were reserved for ecosystem “partners.” Neither mentioned Eigen Labs employees.  Kratik Lodha, an authorized representative for the RestakeX Foundation, which conducted Renzo's airdrop, said ""there was an allocation for ecosystem partners which was not solicited by anyone from EigenLayer.""  CoinDesk subsequently asked Lodha if EigenLayer proactively sent an unsolicited list of blockchain addresses to Renzo ahead of its airdrop in April (which some might not consider an explicit solicitation). He refused to answer.  Clean-up act  Eigen Labs scrapped its airdrop policy in the wake of another controversy that lit up crypto headlines in May involving the Ethereum Foundation, the Swiss non-profit supporting the Ethereum blockchain.  The Foundation revealed two of its lead researchers, Justin Drake and Dankrad Feist, had accepted paid advisory roles with another project building on Ethereum: EigenLayer.  Community members voiced concern on X (formerly Twitter) that EigenLayer was attempting to sway Ethereum’s development roadmap in its favor. Feist and Drake ultimately pledged to redistribute their paydays to Ethereum community projects, and the Ethereum Foundation revised its conflict-of-interest policies to prevent future incidents.  Eigen Labstold CoinDesk that in May it stopped allowing projects in the ecosystem to airdrop tokens to its employees.  The company also said it introduced a policy that ""explicitly prevented any employees from influencing any transactions related to the company for personal gain.""  Eigen Labs also instituted ""a prohibition by team members on selling any airdrops received while in possession of material non-public information, including standardized blackout periods after airdrops.""  The company said it took these steps ""to ensure trust and transparency.""  The Eigen Foundation banned employees ""from individually claiming airdrops"" in a policy shift published on GitHub on June 3, according to commit records. The Foundation cited ""concerns about conflicts of interest or the appearance of such conflicts of interest."" Wallets included on the Eigen Labs list continued claiming through mid-June.  Eigen Labs and the Eigen Foundation say that employees who already claimed airdrops will not be required to return their tokens.  UPDATE (Aug. 15, 20:13 UTC): In a statement released after this story was published, Eigen Labs said: ""[W]e have no knowledge or evidence of any employee at Eigen Labs pressuring any team to unduly benefit the Eigen Labs corporate entity or its employees.""",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | AIRDROP,"Sam Kessler, Danny Nelson",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/08/15/top-crypto-startup-drove-other-projects-airdrops-to-its-employees,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/41194257c5fa19c8b5bc7eb5efc578e2af54582d-5184x2916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,888 −3.6%  Bitcoin (BTC): $58,764 −3.8%  Ether (ETC): $2,639 −3.7%  S&P 500: 5,455.21 +0.4%  Gold: $2,496 +2.3%  Nikkei 225: 36,726.64 +0.78%  Top Stories  Bitcoin has fallen over 4.5% to under $58,500 in the last 24 hours, having dropped as low as $57,750. BTC losses led drops across major tokens, with ETH also down over 4.5% and SOL falling just under 4%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20, a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by capitalization, has lost 3.5%. Much of the drop came after U.S. July consumer price index (CPI) figures were released late Wednesday. The CPI increased by 2.9% year-on-year, as expected, the first time it has risen less than 3% since 2021.  Some traders expect bitcoin to drop as low as $55,000 in the near term, which could spell further losses for other major tokens. Crypto prices have been ""highly sensitive"" to U.S. economic data in recent months as investors prefer stability over riskier assets, according to K33 Research. “A new sell-off momentum is still the prevailing scenario, with a potential pullback to $55K,” Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro senior market analyst, shared in a Thursday note. “Data supporting the Fed's imminent easing of monetary policy may encourage the bulls to overcome the short-term downtrend and give the green light to rise to $66K.”  U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs recorded $81 million in net outflows on Wednesday, ending a two-day positive streak. Grayscale’s GBTC registered $56 million in outflows, the most among counterparts, with Fidelity’s FBTC recording $18 million in outflows. Ark Invest’s ARKB and Bitwise’s BITB lost $6.7 million and $5.7 million respectively. Franklin Templeton’s EZBC and BlackRock’s IBIT were the only products with net inflows, adding a cumulative $6 million.

The digital asset drew a lot of interest since it surged about 50% in seven days. Carter sees the coin notching a solid 190% price rally if all the positive elements fall into place. Related Reading: HODLing Resurgence? 374,000 Bitcoin Transfer Ignites Crypto Recovery Sui’s network shows more than just pricing activity since it has used its technical ability to handle transactions six times faster than Solana. Thanks to its competitive technology, Sui is considered as a budding star in the crypto industry. This upward trend does not appear to be a temporary anomaly. In a linear fashion, SUI has increased by 15% over the past 30 days. In a market that is notorious for its extreme volatility, to observe such consistent growth is exceedingly rare. The market closely monitors Sui as it establishes itself as a dominant force in the blockchain sector. #SUI Token has surged from its lower support of the ascending channel, and breaking above the descending triangle👀 Price now sits above the $0.92 level, eyeing upper resistance levels📈$SUI have potential to reach $2.60 if bullish momentum continues🎯 pic.twitter.com/TesBvI5JFU — Jonathan Carter (@JohncyCrypto) August 13, 2024 Strong Price Performance The current price of SUI stands at $0.8899, with its trading volume over the past 24 hours at $1.38 billion. The crypto asset has fallen slightly by 5% in the past day but generally, it is doing good. This fall is seen more as a normal fluctuation within a market that was due to trend upwards, so it’s not an alarming event. Although it may look like nothing compared to industry behemoths such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, these figures are nothing shy of amazing for a relatively young market competitor. With a market capitalization of $2.3 billion, this token has a 0.10% dominance in the market. Technical Analysis Carter sees SUI as a buy. According to Carter, the token has broken out recently from a descending triangle pattern, proving its resilience. For traders, this is an indication that SUI is about to go higher. Carter believes SUI might hit $2.60 if the current price trajectory continues. SUI Technological Edge However, it is not solely the price that is causing a stir. Additionally, the technical capabilities of the SUI network are garnering attention. The Layer 1 architecture of the platform has successfully processed an impressive 297,000 transactions per second (TPS), attaining transaction finality in a mere 390 milliseconds. That is significantly quicker than the majority of its competitors, including Solana. No L1 is faster than SUI This video compares swaps on Jupiter (Solana) and KriyaDEX (Sui). Results: – Solana: 4.45 seconds – Sui: 0.73 seconds Sui was 6x faster in this test. Credits: @MrBreadSmith pic.twitter.com/Zg485fC1nX — StarPlatinum (@StarPlatinumSOL) August 12, 2024 Actually, a recent test showed Sui to be six times faster than Solana. Clearly, Sui is one of a kind in the DeFi space due to its speed and low fees. It does not come as a shock that the network currently ranks third among non-EVM chains by TVL and within the top 13 by DeFi volume. Related Reading: Bitcoin SV Makes A Surprise Move With 10% Uptick – Details Sui is becoming a major player in the crypto market as it continues to develop.

ZynCoin founder Colton Kirkpatrick said some of the profits will go to token buybacks  ZynCoin, a memecoin that recently persuaded Philip Morris, the Fortune 500-owner of tobacco giant Swedish Match, to back off of legal threats for using the Zyn name, is launching a physical collectible for the $ZYN community called Comfy, which is now available for pre-sale.  Physical collectibles are rare, though not entirely unheard of, in crypto. The most popular is Solana's Saga phone, which built a user base due to aggressive airdrop campaigns.  Comfy is a made-in-the-U.S. aluminum can for storing nicotine pouches, ZynCoin founder Colton Kirkpatrick said in an interview with CoinDesk. It is designed to broaden $ZYN's appeal beyond crypto fans and token holders while providing rewards for the most loyal $Zynners.  ""We want the crypto aspect to be a subtle yet cool draw, so that people are first attracted to the sleek design and unique features of the can, like the bottle opener, and would want to buy it just for that,"" he said. He compared it to the silver cigarette cases popular with the upper classes in the roaring 20s.  Kirkpatrick said some of the profits from the Comfy sales will go to token buybacks, which are intended to increase the value of the $ZYN token.  When users buy a Comfy, they activate a unique code online connecting their account to a crypto wallet holding $ZYN, he said. The more $ZYN they hold, the higher their tier and the greater their weekly rewards.  For its part, the $ZYN token has been one of the more poorly performing memecoins of the last month, losing 50%, and declining faster than the market, according to CoinGecko data. Other memecoin majors like DogWifHat and BONK are also down more than 10% on the month, but not as much.  The Comfy is the first step in building out a larger $ZYN community, and Kirkpatrick said that there are meetups planned for later this year, likely in New York.

32443328,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635495,1723716013,Is The Link Broken? New Analysis Shows Bitcoin’s Price Unmoved By ETF Liquidations,"The evolvement of Bitcoin has led to Bitcoin’s trajectory being linked to several other markets, whereby the stance of certain markets could hint at where BTC is headed. However, according to the latest data, this phenomenon is changing specifically for the correlation of Bitcoin’s price to exchange-traded fund (ETF) movements. Related Reading: Is Now the Time to Buy Bitcoin? Top Analysts Predict $150K Surge On The Horizon Historical Patterns And Recent Deviations The latest observation from a CryptoQuant author on the QuickTake platform has revealed that BTC ETF, particularly the ETC Group Physical Bitcoin (BTCE), an investment fund based in Germany, which has shown a historical pattern of syncing with Bitcoin’s price movements, is now seeing a divergence in correlation. The analyst, Joao Wedson, disclosed that historically, increases in BTCE’s Bitcoin holdings have often aligned with substantial price rallies in Bitcoin itself. For instance, a significant accumulation in the fund’s reserves from 0 to over 23,480 BTC in 2020 coincided with Bitcoin’s surge to its first historic peak in April 2021. Conversely, a reduction in holdings has typically indicated a forthcoming drop in Bitcoin prices. Recent Trends and Changes in Fund Behavior “The historical correlation between BTCE and the Bitcoin price has shown a consistent pattern, where changes in the fund’s reserves generally precede movements in $BTC price.” – By @joao_wedson Link 👇https://t.co/59rWi28opD pic.twitter.com/bKRI4TfePP — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) August 14, 2024 However, a shift in this pattern has been observed since January 2024. Despite the fund’s Bitcoin reserves decreasing from a peak of 27,980 BTC to below 17,000 BTC, the anticipated decline in Bitcoin’s price hasn’t materialized to the extent predicted by past trends. This divergence suggests a potential decoupling of the fund’s activities from direct Bitcoin price movements, marking a change in how BTC’s market relation with this product might be interpreted. Wedson revealed that this observation is evident in the 30-day variance of the BTCE fund analysis. This analysis showed that positive variances in the fund’s reserves were typically associated with Bitcoin price rises, and negative variances correlated with price drops. The recent period, however, stands as an exception to these findings, with Bitcoin’s price rising despite continued sell-offs from the fund. Bitcoin Market Performance And Future Outlook Bitcoin is trading for $59,144 at the time of writing, following a 3.6% dip in the past 24 hours. According to the latest report, this decline comes after the US inflation fell to 2.9%, the lowest since 2021. Amid this price performance, Economist and Trader Mikybull Crypto on X, has pointed out the potential rally for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Headed For A Rally Or Ruin? This Key Price Point Could Decide This rally, according to the analyst is based on the global liquidity index breaking out of a 2-year resistance.

Jefferies cut its Marathon Digital price target to $17 from $22.  U.S-listed mining companies produced a larger share of bitcoin in July, the report said.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} mining was slightly less profitable in July than the previous month as the price of the world's largest cryptocurrency fell over 6% while the network hashrate remained stable, investment bank Jefferies said in a research report on Thursday.  Hashrate is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty.  The bank cut its Marathon Digital (MARA) price target to $17 from $22 while maintaining a hold rating on the shares. The stock fell 0.7% to around $15 in pre-market trading.  U.S.-listed mining companies produced a larger share of bitcoin in July than June, accounting for 21.1% of the total network versus 20.7% in May, the report said. August will be a more difficult month for the miners as the price of bitcoin has dropped about 5% while the network hashrate has started to grow again, the report added.  Their market share rose as ""public players brought on new capacity faster than the network hashrate increased,"" analysts Jonathan Petersen and Joe Dickstein wrote.  Marathon Digital produced the most bitcoin in July, a total of 692 coins or 17% more than the month before, the report noted. The miner's installed hashrate also remains the largest in the sector.  Wall Street giant JPMorgan (JPM) noted that U.S.-listed miners' share of the global hashrate reached a record in July, the bank said in a report last month.

So far, the asset has ranged below $60,000 in the past week, as it appears to face resistance whenever it reaches that price mark. However, several analysts and experts share their optimistic outlook on top crypto despite this. Sminston With, a prominent Bitcoin researcher, recently offered an interesting forecast on BTC based on a detailed examination of the asset’s price trajectory over past bull cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Set To Surge With $2.5 Billion Stablecoin Inflows: Research Firm Decoding Bitcoin’s ‘Decaying Peaks’ Shared in a post on Elon Musk’s social media platform, X, With’s analysis draws from the peak periods of Bitcoin in 2011, 2013, and 2017 to project future possibilities for this leading cryptocurrency. The concept used in the analysis, “decaying peaks,” refers to the progressively lower returns seen in successive Bitcoin bull runs as the market matures and gains wider acceptance. This phenomenon is captured through an analysis known as the “exponential decay fit,” which Is employed to evaluate the peaks of Bitcoin’s past bull cycles by aligning the historical data points of 2011, 2013, and 2017, With aimed to delineate a pattern that could suggest future price movements.

The model predicted a peak of $65,732.72, closely shadowing the actual peak of $64,682.47, highlighting the potential reliability of this analytical approach. Towards A $164,000 Bitcoin By 2025? Now extending his analytical framework to the upcoming cycles, he ventured a bold prediction for the 2024-2025 period. The estimation of the decaying peaks model sketches an ambitious trajectory that could see Bitcoin reaching as high as $164,000. This projection is based on continuing patterns observed in BTC’s past market behaviors.

MakerDAO passed a motion to reduce its exposure to wBTC, but it will not liquidate existing positions.  BitGo CEO Mike Belshe took the opportunity of an online discussion to reiterate the safety of the bitcoin {{BTC}} that underpins its wBTC {{WBTC}}, a token that allows the largest cryptocurrency by market cap to be utilized on blockchains other than the original Bitcoin system.  In an X Spaces discussion, Belshe reiterated that Tron founder Justin Sun does not have access to the cryptocurrency custodian's asset keys.  Belshe's assurance came as DAI stablecoin issuer MakerDAO passed a motion to eliminate its exposure to wBTC due to concerns that a proposal to shift custody to be held jointly with BiT Global – an entity partially controlled by Sun – would centralize too much control with BiT Global.  During the online discussion, Belshe said the keys would be split between BitGo's U.S., and Singapore entities as well as BiT Global.  ""There is no single party that has the ability to mint or steal from the underlying treasury,"" Belshe said. Community concern mostly came from not understanding the operational mechanics of the keys, he said.  Belshe also highlighted that Sun is not an employee of BiT Global. The company, he said, is structured as a public holding company in Hong Kong with a fiduciary duty to secure customer assets. Under local laws, no individual can own more than 20% of the company.  MakerDAO's decision, which becomes available for execution after 13:24 UTC on Aug. 15, aims for the organization to stop tapping its wBTC vaults for liquidity. This would prevent further borrowing from these vaults, but existing positions would not be liquidated.  Data from Dune shows that wBTC remains stable and there has been no discernable change in the volume of burns, or redemptions of wBTC for bitcoin as users look for alternatives.

32441518,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24006,1723708800,Bitfinex Agrees Memorandum of Understanding to Explore Integration with Komainu Connect for New Remote Custody Solution,"ROAD TOWN, Tortola, British Virgin Islands – August 15, 2024 – Bitfinex , a state-of-the-art digital asset trading platform, has announced a collaboration to explore a strategic integration with Komainu Connect, a regulated digital asset custodian. The integration is expected to allow institutions and sophisticated investors to leverage Bitfinex’s deep liquidity and advanced trading features while maintaining the security of their assets in a separate, regulated custody environment. This collaboration is enabled by Ledger Enterprise’s off-exchange trading and settlement technology, Ledger Tradelink , which enables institutional customers to trade through the Bitfinex platform. By working with Bitfinex, the Komainu Connect integration is expected to allow institutions to trade on one of the world’s most liquid markets for crypto assets, while keeping their assets segregated with a regulated custodian. One of the key benefits institutions will gain from this integration is the ability to enjoy uninterrupted trading on Bitfinex without frequent on-chain asset transfers, as well as the security offered by keeping assets in custody with Komainu. The integration would be the latest remote custodian solution offered by Bitfinex, and follows similar arrangements it has with other custodian partners, which have both proved popular with institutional customers. Traders with assets on Komainu Connect and a verified account on Bitfinex will be able to allocate a portion of their custody-held assets for trading, initiating a lock at Komainu. Simultaneously, Komainu Connect will notify Bitfinex through an API connection. Upon approval, Bitfinex will grant the trader a balance equivalent to the locked amount, enabling seamless trading with the designated assets. “Our collaboration with Komainu Connect reflects our commitment to expanding secure trading options for our customers and provides an additional layer of security for institutional investors by allowing them to leverage Komainu’s regulated custody solution while still accessing Bitfinex’s robust trading environment,” said Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Bitfinex . We are thrilled to welcome Bitfinex to our Komainu Connect platform,” said Paul Frost-Smith, Co-CEO at Komainu . “This collaboration expands our ecosystem of trusted exchanges, further enhancing liquidity across our growing network of trading venues from centralised exchanges, OTC desks, market makers and prime brokers. “Our collaboration with Komainu and Bitfinex heralds a new era for capital markets through the launch of a new open protocol standard for off-exchange trading. We’ve long believed that establishing a unified standard for off-exchange collateral pledging and settlement among custodians, exchanges, and liquidity providers is crucial for scaling the institutional digital asset market. We’re delighted that Komainu and Bitfinex have chosen to integrate Ledger Tradelink technology, and we look forward to bringing this groundbreaking solution to market,” added Sebastien Badault, Executive VP of Enterprise Revenue at Ledger. As compliance gains increasing prominence as regulations evolve, cryptocurrency exchanges bear a crucial responsibility to safeguard customer assets. Bitfinex’s collaboration with Komainu Connect highlights the exchange’s proactive approach to compliance. To learn more about Bitfinex please visit https://www.bitfinex.com/ .

42390590,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd421P,1723707568,"Bitcoin Drops to $58K After U.S. CPI Print, BTC ETFs Record $81M Outflow","Bitcoin fell over 4% to around $58,000, leading to a broader market drop where other major cryptocurrencies like Ether, Solana, Cardano, BNB Chain, and XRP fared slightly better, with losses ranging from 2.5% to 3.8%.  The decline came after by the release of U.S. CPI data, despite positive stock market reactions. U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflows, with Grayscale's GBTC being the most affected, while Ether ETFs saw continued inflows, with BlackRock's ETHA notably gaining.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} slipped more than 4% in the past 24 hours to trade near the $58,000 level in Asian afternoon hours Thursday, retracing nearly all gains from the past week.  BTC led losses as the slide led to a drop across major tokens. Ether {{ETH}} fell 3.8%, while Solana’s {{SOL}}, Cardano’s {{ADA}}, BNB Chain’s {{BNB}} and Ripple's XRP{{(XRP}} dropped a smaller 2.5%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20, a liquid fund tracking the largest tokens by capitalization, lost 3.5%.  Much of the drop came after the latest July U.S. consumer price index (CPI) figures were released late on Wednesday. July's CPI increased by 2.9% year-on-year, as expected, marking the first time since 2021 that it has fallen below 3%.  Despite the NASDAQ and S&P 500 reversing an early sell-off and ending the day in the green, BTC continued its sell-off after the CPI print. Crypto prices have been ""highly sensitive"" to U.S. economic data in recent months, as per K33 Research, and tend to move as investors prefer stability over riskier assets.  As such, some traders expect BTC prices to drop to as low as $55,000 in the near term, before a leg up, which could spell further losses for major tokens.  “A new sell-off momentum is still the prevailing scenario, with a potential pullback to $55K,” Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro senior market analyst, shared in a Thursday note. “Data supporting the Fed's imminent easing of monetary policy may encourage the bulls to overcome the short-term downtrend and give the green light to rise to $66K.”  Elsewhere, U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded $81 million in net outflows on Wednesday, ending a two-day positive streak. Grayscale’s GBTC registered $56 million in outflows, the most among counterparts, with Fidelity’s FBTC recording $18 million in outflows. Ark Invest’s ARKB and Bitwise’s BITB lost $6.7 million and $5.7 million respectively.  Franklin Templeton’s EZBC and BlackRock’s IBIT were the only products with net inflows of a cumulative $6 million.  Ether ETFs fared better with $10 million in net inflows, extending a streak to three days. BlackRock’s ETHA recorded $16 million in inflows, while Grayscale’s ETHE lost $16 million.

32439958,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635420,1723707028,Solana At A Crux: Will SOL Crash To $120 Accelerated By These Factors?,"Solana remains one of the top-performing crypto assets over the past year. Even though there is a retracement from the 2024 highs, the coin is still multiples higher than the 2022 lows. Traders are upbeat about what lies ahead, with some convinced the coin will easily break $260 and register all-time highs in the coming months. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other top altcoins like Cardano, SOL faces determined sellers. From the daily chart, SOL is moving sideways in a possible accumulation, considering the current primary trend remains upward. However, on lower time frames, one trader thinks SOL might struggle in the coming few sessions. SOL Holders To Prepare For More Pain? Taking to X has picked out a head and short formation in the hourly chart. Technically, this candlestick pattern is associated with weakness. Of note is that this formation prints when the coin consolidates inside the bear range from July 28 through August 5. Related Reading: HODLing Resurgence? 374,000 Bitcoin Transfer Ignites Crypto Recovery From the daily chart, SOL faces strong resistance at an August 8 high of $162. On the lower end, support is at $142. The sideways movement and fluctuation inside this range have formed a bear flag–another selling signal, especially if sellers of late July and early August press on. In the hourly chart, the immediate resistance is around $150, marking the tip of the head. However, the top of the shoulder is at around $146. Meanwhile, the baseline of this pattern is at $142, coinciding with the critical support in the daily chart. Therefore, reading from the above candlestick formation means that traders should prepare for more pain unless Solana bulls push higher. A break below $142 in the daily chart sets the ball rolling for aggressive sellers targeting June and July lows of around $120. Solana Challenges: Centralization Claims, High Transaction Processing Failure Rate The upside momentum, looking at other developments besides candlestick formation, is fizzling out. Last week, a severe security flaw was discovered and quickly patched. Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised To Reach New All-Time Highs: Expert Dives Into Tether’s Role As The Key The critical vulnerability, analysts said, had the potential to cripple the whole network. What’s concerning is that even considering the severity of the flaw, the Solana Foundation and developers chose a “quiet” fix, calling into question Solana’s decentralization level. Additionally, Solana has been struggling with high transaction processing failures. According to trading data from Jupiter, a top DEX on Solana, only about 35% of all transactions posted go through. A big chunk, or 65% of all transactions, fail. The high failure rate significantly undermines some of the platform’s key selling points, mainly its low fees and high scalability.

32437349,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635499,1723701606,"Solana Whale Sell-Offs Threaten $1,000 Dream, But Fundamentals Remain Strong","A Solana (SOL) whale has been offloading a significant amount of its holdings for a while, a move that could significantly impact Solana’s price and the projected move to $1,000. Solana’s fundamentals remain strong amid these sell-offs, suggesting that SOL could still enjoy a significant rally. Solana Whale Has Sold $86 Million Worth Of SOL This Year The on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post a Solana whale that has sold 594,000 SOL ($86 million) this year. Since January 15, this whale is said to have deposited its Solana holdings to Coinbase, Binance, and OKX, averaging one sale weekly. The whale’s last sale came on August 12, when it sold off 5,000 SOL ($720,000). Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Will Rally 10,400% To $60, Here’s When On-chain data further shows that this whale only has about 0.1 SOL remaining in its wallet address, meaning that the selling pressure from this particular investor is over. However, the Solana meme coin launchpad Pump.fun is another whale the Solana community might have to worry about. Lookonchain revealed in another X post that the Pump.fun fee account has sold 222,073 SOL for 35.54 million USDC at an average price of $160 in the past three months. Pump.fun still holds a significant amount of SOL that can put massive selling pressure on the token’s price, as on-chain data shows that the fee account still holds 274,583 SOL ($39.7 million). These Solana whales offloading their tokens is undoubtedly worrisome, especially considering how this sell pressure could hinder Solana’s projected rise to $1,000. Crypto analysts like Ali Martinez have predicted that SOL will reach $1,000 in this bull run. The analyst has gone as far as drawing similarities between Solana’s current price action and the 2021 bull run to prove that the token can reach such ambitious heights. Crypto analyst Crypto Kaleo also claimed that $1,000 is a reasonable target for Solana if the token can replicate a similar growth to the one Ethereum enjoyed in the last cycle when it hit an all-time high (ATH) of $4,800. Solana’s Strong Fundamentals Still Indicate A Significant Price Rally Solana’s strong fundamentals still suggest that SOL will likely enjoy a significant rally before the crypto token peaks in this bull run, although it remains to be seen if it can reach as high as $1,000. One of these fundamentals is the potential launch of a Spot Solana ETF in the United States. The approval of such a fund would lead to new money flowing into the Solana ecosystem. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Ready For 75% Breakout To $4,723, Here’s Why Meanwhile, Solana continues to compete with Ethereum in terms of decentralized exchange (DEX) volume.

TRX is outperforming Bitcoin and could rise further above $0.1320. Tron is moving higher above the $0.1280 resistance level against the US dollar. The price is trading above $0.130 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1305 on the hourly chart of the TRX/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to climb higher toward $0.1335 or even $0.1350. Tron Price Eyes More Upsides Recently, Bitcoin and Ethereum saw a fresh decline below $60,000 and $2,700 respectively. However, Tron price remained stable above the $0.1250 support and climbed higher. There was a decent move above the $0.1300 resistance zone. TRX price even tested the $0.1315 level. A high is formed at $0.1314 and the price is showing signs of more upsides. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.1305 on the hourly chart of the TRX/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1256 swing low to the $0.1314 high. The price is now trading above $0.1300 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, an initial resistance is near the $0.1320 level The first major resistance is near $0.1332, above which the price could accelerate higher. The next resistance is near $0.1350. A close above the $0.1350 resistance might send TRX further higher toward $0.1400. The next major resistance is near the $0.1420 level, above which the bulls are likely to aim for a larger increase toward $0.1450 in the near term. Are Dips Supported in TRX? If TRX price fails to clear the $0.1320 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1300 zone and the trend line. The first major support is near the $0.1285 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1256 swing low to the $0.1314 high, below which it could test $0.1280. Any more losses might send Tron toward the $0.1265 support in the coming sessions. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for TRX/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for TRX/USD is currently above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.1300 and $0.1285.

32435354,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635496,1723698057,Unveiling The Strategic Advantages Of A Bitcoin Reserve For The US Economy,"As the 2024 presidential election approaches, the idea of the United States government establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve is gaining momentum. This potential policy shift has been championed by former President Donald Trump and pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis, who see it as a novel way to help pay down the country’s $35 trillion national debt. The concept was recently explored in depth by Bitcoin-focused financial institution River in a detailed video analysis, arguing that accumulating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve could provide several key advantages for the US government. Bitcoin Reserve As Antidote To US Debt Crisis? Beginning with the example of the United States, the firm points out the nation’s national debt, emphasizing the critical need for actions that can fortify the country’s financial standing. River posits that one method to bolster this position involves acquiring assets that appreciate in value over time, potentially enabling the country to offset a substantial portion of its debt in the future, given that the asset appreciates faster than the rate at which new currency is printed. Drawing attention to Bitcoin’s notable yearly average growth rate over the past decade, River showcases the chart below, which displays BTC’s surge of over 60%, underscoring its limited supply of 21 million coins, positioning it as scarcer than traditional stores of value like gold and fiat currencies. Related Reading: BNB Price Back on Track: Can It Break $535 to Move Higher? The video also references El Salvador’s Bitcoin reserve strategy, highlighting the nation’s acquisition of approximately 5,800 BTC valued at around $340 million, with a notable profit margin of 38%, equating to approximately $50 million. Comparatively, the United States is one of the largest Bitcoin holders globally, possessing 213,246 BTC, predominantly sourced from the Silk Road marketplace confiscation and funds stolen from the Bitfinex exchange. River advocates that if the US were to secure 5% of the total BTC supply, it could substantially alleviate a significant portion of the national debt burden. Moreover, the firm posits that establishing Strategic Bitcoin Reserves by more countries could amplify Bitcoin’s value proposition, potentially catalyzing a domino effect where nations vie to adopt similar strategies to avoid falling behind in the evolving financial landscape. The firm concluded by stating that implementing a Bitcoin Reserve would benefit the nation and its citizens and contribute to Bitcoin’s mainstream adoption and usability over time, fostering a more seamless integration into everyday transactions. Trump And Lummis Push For US BTC Reserve River’s analysis comes from previous statements by Donald Trump and Senator Cynthia Lummis last month, highlighting their visions for using BTC to address the staggering national debt. Trump’s comments hint at the distribution of cryptocurrency to alleviate the debt burden. At the same time, Senator Lummis proposes a strategic plan to acquire one million BTC over five years to carve out a 5% share of the total Bitcoin supply to reduce the country’s mounting debt. Related Reading: Maker Sees 7% Upswing As Key Indicators Signal $2,662 Resistance Test In her address at the Bitcoin 2024 conference, Lummis emphasized that establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could safeguard the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency and solidify the United States’ leadership in financial innovation, positioning the nation for continued prosperity in the 21st century. BTC is trading at $59,000, down 1% over the past 24 hours after failing to consolidate above the key $60,000 level.

32433491,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635369,1723694401,This Is The On-Chain Level That Made The Bitcoin Crash Bottom,"On-chain data suggests the Bitcoin price found its bottom following the recent crash around this important investor cost basis level. Bitcoin Found Its Bottom Near Active Investor’s Cost Basis According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, Bitcoin formed its recent bottom near the cost basis of the “active investors.” To understand what this level represents, two other indicators need to be looked at first: the Realized Price and the Liveliness. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Are “Important, But Not The Drivers,” On-Chain Analyst Argues The Realized Price refers to the cost basis or acquisition price of the average investor on the BTC network. The metric determines this by going through the transaction history of each token in circulation to find what price it was last moved at. It then works with the assumption that this previous transfer was the last time that the coin changed hands and so, takes the price at its time to be its current cost basis. Finally, it averages this value out for the entire supply, producing a price that’s often considered to be BTC’s “fair value.” The other indicator, the Liveliness, basically keeps track of the spending/HODLing behavior of the investors. This metric makes use of the concept of “coin days” to calculate its value. A coin day is a quantity that 1 BTC is said to accumulate after staying dormant on the blockchain for 1 day. Thus, when HODLing occurs on the network, new coin days are “created” each day, while when spending occurs, coin days that had been accumulated earlier are “destroyed.” The Liveliness measures the ratio between the cumulative sum of coin days destroyed and the cumulative sum of coin days created over the cryptocurrency’s history. As such, whenever the market is showing a HODLing dominant behavior, the metric’s value tends towards the zero mark, as a low amount of coin days are seeing destruction. Similarly, it leans towards 1 when distribution is high. Now, the actual indicator of focus in the current discussion is the “Realized Price-to-Liveliness Ratio,” also known as the Active Investor’s Cost Basis. This indicator adds a weightage factor to Bitcoin’s Realized price (that is, its fair value) using the Liveliness. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Participate In $588 Million Selloff: Is There More To Come? With this modification, BTC’s fair value is estimated higher when HODLing is dominant and lower when distribution is happening. The below chart shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Price-to-Liveliness Ratio over the past decade: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Realized Price-to-Liveliness Ratio is currently at a value of $51,300. In The recent price crash, BTC ended up finding a bottom not too far from this mark. “The Active Investor’s Cost-Basis can be considered as a key threshold delineating bullish and bearish investor sentiment,” notes Glassnode. “Since the market managed to find support near this level speaks to a degree of underlying strength, suggesting investors are generally still anticipating positive market momentum in the short-to-medium-term.” BTC Price Bitcoin has seen a jump of almost 4% during the last 24 hours, which has taken its price above $61,000.

32431526,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=635554,1723690858,Solana Poised For $400-500 Upside As Analyst Spots Wave 5 Formation,"Solana (SOL), one of the largest digital assets in the market by market capitalization, has been in a period of price consolidation, oscillating between the $140 and $150 price range. This period follows a significant drop that saw SOL plummet to $109 on August 5th, with a modest recovery since then. However, despite its resurgence, Solana has struggled to break above upper resistance levels, reflecting a pattern reminiscent of Bitcoin’s (BTC) price movements for the past week. Solana Price Forecast According to crypto analyst “XForce,” Solana is currently positioned in a way that is strikingly similar to Bitcoin’s price action, just on a different scale. Related Reading: Will The Bitcoin Price Return To $20,000? Crypto Analyst Provides Answers The analyst contends that Solana is likely in the midst of a “wave 4” consolidation phase and is poised to enter a “wave 5” that could potentially double its current all-time high of $259, reached during the November 2021 bull run. This would imply a price target of approximately $400-$500 for Solana at the top of this market cycle, which could represent a price increase of nearly 250% from current market levels. However, the analyst also warns that in the near term, Solana could experience a deeper correction, with targets potentially as low as a 22% drop to $110 or even a sharper decline to the $75 mark. This scenario is based on the analyst’s belief that Solana could enter in a “wave Y” correction. Bearish Pattern Emerge, Threatening $100 Support Adding to the technical analysis, Ali Martinez has recently spotted a potential head and shoulders pattern forming on Solana’s hourly chart. This pattern suggests that a breach below the $141 level could trigger a correction, sending Solana down to the $122 range. This level is of particular importance for Solana bulls, as a breach below $141 could potentially jeopardize the token’s year-to-date macro uptrend, which has been in place since February. If the $122 level is lost, the theory put forth by XForce, the first analyst, could come into play, with Solana potentially retesting the crucial $100 support floor. This would be a significant test for the token’s long-term prospects, as a breach of this level could have broader implications for Solana’s overall market sentiment and investor confidence. Related Reading: Ethereum Price To Hit New All-Time High If This Happens: Crypto Analyst Currently, SOL is trading at $144, down over 2% in the 24-hour time frame, mirroring the broader market’s price action. However, in the case of further catalysts for the token’s price action, there are also crucial levels to overcome if the bulls want to get past the $200 mark. On the SOL/USDT daily chart, the first hurdle that led to the current consolidation range for SOL was at $153, as the first barrier that prevented a test of the next obstacle at $163. Gaining these two levels in the short term will be key to anticipate a move towards $183 before a leg up to the $200 mark.

Crypto Analyst Predicts 42,000% Breakout","A crypto analyst has issued a bold price forecast for the XRP price, the native token of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The analyst foresees a massive 42,000% breakout in XRP’s price, potentially pushing the cryptocurrency beyond the $250 mark. Analyst Foresees XRP Price Reaching $263 Javon Marks, a crypto analyst, took to X (formerly Twitter) on August 13 to discuss his analysis of XRP’s recent price movements and future outlook. The analyst boldly suggests that if XRP experiences a bullish breakout today, then the price of the cryptocurrency could reach $263, representing a 42,000% increase from its current value. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Inverted Triangle, Analyst Peter Brandt Explains What This Means According to Marks chart analysis, XRP is nearing the converging point of a nearly seven year old consolidation pattern. The analyst disclosed that the development of this pattern has triggered the appearance of multiple bullish signals, indicating the strong potential for a significant breakout. Marks has grounded his optimistic forecast for XRP on key historical strategies and patterns. The analyst strongly believes that XRP could reach its full potential by experiencing a massive price increase above the $200 mark. This bullish projection is based on the assumption that XRP replicates or follows through the favorable conditions and trends from past successful periods. Given that XRP’s price is presently trading below $1, the analyst’s price forecast may appear as overly optimistic or ambitious. However, since Ripple’s legal win against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), many analysts have become incredibly bullish about XRP’s price outlook. A few analysts have suggested that the regulatory clarity from the concluded Ripple and SEC case could trigger bullish momentum for XRP. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.57, reflecting a 12.14% increase over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap. XRP Eyes Fresh Breakout To $600 In a recent X post, crypto analyst and XRP supporter Brett Hill declared that XRP’s long-awaited breakout from the 2018 to 2024 triangle pattern was imminent. Hill predicts that if XRP successfully breaks through this unique triangle pattern, it could trigger a dramatic rise to $600. Sharing a price chart of XRP’s movement from 2014 to 2024, the analyst compared XRP’s projected breakout to $600 with a past event between 2013 and 2017, where the cryptocurrency witnessed a massive price surge. Based on this historical trend, Hill suggests that XRP could witness a similar price movement, potentially pushing its price to new all-time highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Ready For 75% Breakout To $4,723, Here’s Why Providing a more conservative price forecast for XRP, a crypto analyst identified as ‘Dark Defender’ has outlined several price targets for XRP. The analyst revealed that a Bullish Hammer Candle observed on XRP’s weekly chart was now forming on a larger monthly scale, indicating a potential for a strong bullish trend. Based on this candle pattern, Dark Defender forecasts that XRP could achieve new price targets of around $1, $1.4, and $1.88 if current bullish trends continue.

42417435,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYQqT,1723683797,"U.S. Crypto Bill Can Happen This Year, Senate's Schumer Tells Crypto Backers of Harris","U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer came out guns-blazing during a Crypto4Harris event, saying what's been considered a longshot idea of getting some kind of crypto legislation out this year could really happen.  Billionaire Mark Cuban said former President Donald Trump and his party are primarily interested in crypto to make rich digital assets investors richer.  Sens. Debbie Stabenow and Kirsten Gillibrand joined nearly a dozen other Democratic lawmakers, as well as industry titans like Mark Cuban and Anthony Scaramucci, in a virtual event to garner crypto support for Vice President Kamala Harris's presidential bid.  U.S. crypto legislation can happen this year, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N,Y,) said Wednesday at the first major event in which crypto insiders have come out for Vice President Kamala Harris as their favored presidential contender.  ""We all believe in the future of crypto,"" Schumer said at an online event hosted by Crypto4Harris. ""Congress has a responsibility to provide common sense and sound regulation on crypto, and we need your support to make sure that any proposal is bipartisan.""  In Harris' absence, several Democratic lawmakers and prominent supporters stood in and shared assurances during the virtual town hall that she would pave the way for new U.S. crypto regulations.  Crypto4Harris is among a handful of fledgling efforts aiming to drum up crypto-world backing for Harris after months in which former President Donald Trump seemed to be cementing himself as the industry's pick. Harris hasn't made any policy statements about digital assets in the U.S., and her campaign hasn't formally embraced crypto support, though campaign officials were said to be listening in at the opening online event.  Schumer's legislative optimism faces a number of practical hurdles. This congressional session is careening into the general election, making potential progress difficult on major policy efforts. While the House of Representatives has made some strides this year in pushing crypto bills through final approvals, the Senate hasn't matched that progress.  ""I believe we can make that happen,"" Schumer insisted, but he didn't specify what the bill might be beyond getting ""something passed out of the Senate.""  Still, Schumer said twice that his goal was to have a bill passed out of the Senate and signed into law by the end of the year. He mentioned the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), a House-passed bill spearheaded by Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), as well as a yet-to-be-introduced bill being developed in the Senate Agriculture Committee, though he stopped short of explicitly endorsing either product.  ""Crypto is here to stay, no matter what, so Congress must get it right,"" Schumer said.  SkyBridge Capital's Anthony Scaramucci, who briefly served as Trump's press secretary, said he was looking for crypto to remain bipartisan and ""less tribal.""  Congressman Wiley Nickel (D-N.C.) briefly praised crypto before introducing a panel of additional lawmakers to speak to the attendees.  ""Let me tell you, there's only one candidate running for president who's called crypto a scam, and that's Donald Trump,"" Nickel said. ""He did absolutely nothing for four years as president and was openly hostile up until just recently.""  Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), who chairs the Senate Agriculture Committee, said her goal is to ""provide the structure that both protects consumers but also allows this innovation to really flourish,"" referring to crypto commodities as something the Commodity Futures Trading Commission – long seen as a potentially friendlier regulator toward crypto than the Securities and Exchange Commission – should oversee.  ""Our House colleagues have already moved forward a bill. In the senate, it's the Democrats that are serious about getting something done and working with our great new president,"" she said.  Billionaire Mark Cuban, who has been heavily involved in trying to get Harris into the pro-crypto camp, said that Trump and Republicans are only interested in crypto to boost the wealth of their allies.  ""They just want to see the Bitcoin maxis get richer,"" Cuban said.  Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y), Gov. Jared Polis (D-Colo.) – a former House member who cofounded the Congressional Blockchain Caucus – and Reps. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) – both of whom are running for their states' respective Senate seats – spoke with both pretaped and live remarks. Other lawmakers similarly took the virtual stage to speak to the innovations they saw in crypto, how they believed the Democratic Party could approach the industry and otherwise support the effort to raise support and funds for Harris.  Until Harris makes her policy positions clear, she'll generally be judged on the record of the Biden administration. For crypto, that record has been marked by years of legal combat and an inability to get industry-specific regulations in place.  The industry's primary election weapon – the extremely well funded Fairshake political action committee – has straddled a careful line between the parties. It lavished millions on political ads during the congressional primary elections this year, spreading that spending to both Democrats and Republicans, and its recent disclosures of ad buying for the general elections show a similar split.  In the House, Fairshake and its affiliate PACs (one for Democrats and one for Republicans) is so far backing nine incumbent Democrats and nine incumbent Republicans. In the Senate, they're devoting $12 million to defeat Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the sitting chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, while also committing $3 million each to Democrats seeking seats in the key states of Arizona and Michigan.  The industry's primary campaign-finance arm hasn't touched the presidential race, yet, and has shown no signs of weighing in. Some of the biggest sources of Fairshake's cash, though, have also backed Trump.  Crypto4Harris said that ""grass-roots"" fundraisers will start in mid-September to raise money from the crypto crowd.

According to CoinGecko, the token is up over 10% since last week, becoming one of the top gainers within this market environment. Related Reading: HODLing Resurgence? 374,000 Bitcoin Transfer Ignites Crypto Recovery With private equity enjoying gains as well, the bullishness has leaked to the crypto market, turning the early August wipe into well-deserved upticks. Bitcoin SV On Good Price Range For A Breakout As of writing, the token sits right in the middle of the $40-$46 price range which will be essential for the coming breakout. For the bulls, maintaining the current momentum of the token is vital in the long term. The market’s continuous bullishness should be enough to prop up the bulls if exhaustion takes over. However, the relative strength index (RSI) of the token reveals that the bulls and the bears are in a tight lock, indicating that BSV’s momentum has slightly gone down. But with the general market in support of the bulls in the short term, the token has a shot at taking $62 in the long term if the momentum is consistent. But this also depends on the general outlook of the market. As G7 economies experience slightly better economic conditions, the market will continue to be positive on the coming release of several economic indicators in the coming weeks. Market Hunkers Down As CPI Data Release Nears As of writing, traders in traditional finance are still split between a 25 and 50 base point cut in the coming weeks. However, 51% of traders are still expecting a 50 bps cut once the consumer price data is released. The CPI is one of the most crucial economic indicators that investors and traders are monitoring monthly. Last July, the CPI data showed a slight dip in CPI, indicating a slight dip in the purchasing power of the US dollar. With the release of the CPI data nearing, the general market enters a lockdown phase, gaining slight upticks in the short term to stabilize the price in a manageable price range. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones are both up over a percent as the market gradually slows its momentum. Related Reading: Helium (HNT) Surges 48% — Here’s What’s Fueling The Rally If the CPI data shows that inflation is dropping, the market’s assumption of a rate cut will eventually come true. A drop in interest rate will not only be beneficial for TradFi but also for the crypto market as the latter’s movement hinges on the movement of private equity. However, another dip in CPI might push the US Federal Reserve to maintain its interest rates which is currently 5.5% after the 8th Federal Open Market Committee last month. This scenario will see large outflows on both stocks and crypto, hurting long-term and short-term gains.
