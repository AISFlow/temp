Onchain data has revealed that the number of Bitcoin unmoved in a 3-month timeframe has reached a record high of 88.5%. The upside potential remains huge despite the ongoing consolidation, as the top crypto is still up by 26% since the beginning of October. Related Reading: RUNE Solid 100% Rally Hits Barrier: THORChain Price Nears Key Resistance BTC Price Drops Below $35,000 But Investor Sentiment Remains Bullish Bitcoin managed to push above $35,000 a few times this week, propelling millions of BTC wallets into profitability. The crypto has since dropped below $35,000, but long-term investors remain optimistic, according to on-chain analytics of Bitcoin movement. One particular metric that speaks a lot about the current Bitcoin cycle is Glassnode’s HODL Waves. HODL Waves change color based on their age in wallets. Bitcoins start at red immediately after they’re transferred into wallets and gradually transition to purple as they continue to remain unmoved. This metric, which tracks the age of Bitcoins on the move and on wallets, has shown almost 90% of BTC total supply has remained idle in the past three months. The hilarious thing is that 88.5% of the #bitcoin supply hasn’t moved in the last three months. Wall Street is gonna have to really pump this thing to get hodlers to part with their coins. $BTC pic.twitter.com/CtD7GoA9ka — Dylan LeClair 🟠 (@DylanLeClair_) November 2, 2023 A similar metric from IntoTheBlock has shown retail traders joining the long-term holder bandwagon as investors start to hold on to their assets in the prospect of a BTC spot ETF approval by the SEC. IntoTheBlock’s holding metric puts the number of addresses holding Bitcoin for more than one year at an all-time high of 34 million addresses. Related Reading: This Chainlink Metric Just Hit Meteoric Levels – Good News For LINK Price? BTC market cap currently at $679.499 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com Investors Anticipate SEC Approval Of Spot Bitcoin ETFs Several factors have contributed to the increase in long-term confidence of Bitcoin investors, one of which is the commencement of a spot ETF trading in the US. The industry expects the SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs to ignite the next bullish run for the price of Bitcoin. A top executive at Valkyrie Investments is very confident these ETF applications will be approved by the end of the month. However, Singapore-based QCP Capital attributed the recent spike in Bitcoin to macro forces like the drop in US bond yields, not the excitement around spot ETFs. Low bond yields force investors to look into higher-yield investments like BTC. Overall, Bitcoin looks to remain in a consolidation phase until buyers step back in or some catalyst drives the next rally. The last time Bitcoin’s supply reached 88% for this metric was during a consolidation in late 2022, where bears got the better and Bitcoin dipped below $20,000. A continued consolidation could see Bitcoin follow this pattern, breaking below its current range to reach $30,000.

While some crypto analysts currently have bearish projections for the premier cryptocurrency, others have maintained a positive stance for BTC’s performance in November and beyond. A crypto analyst known by the pseudonym Mags on the X (formerly Twitter) platform recently offered an insight into Bitcoin’s price action, quelling bearish sentiments around the pioneer cryptocurrency. The Current Cycle Witnessed Its Own Black Swan Event Bitcoin enthusiasts and analysts have been closely monitoring the coin’s price movements, with some skeptics anticipating a significant drop to as low as $12,000. Mags, on the other hand, said on X that the recent slow but steady upward trajectory of Bitcoin suggests a different narrative. Related Reading: RUNE Solid 100% Rally Hits Barrier: THORChain Price Nears Key Resistance The crypto analyst posited that the current Bitcoin price action resembles a phase of vertical accumulation, hinting at the potential for a parabolic surge in the near future. Mags claimed that people waiting for a substantial price decline seem to be in disbelief. Furthermore, Mags suggested that most bearish projections are centered around the potential occurrence of a black swan event. For context, a black swan event refers to an unpredictable incident that is beyond what is normally expected of a situation and has potentially severe consequences. However, the analyst believes that the anticipated black swan event has already occurred. While the black swan event in the 2021 bull cycle was the COVID-19-induced market crash, the current bull cycle witnessed the FTX exchange collapse as its own black swan event. As a result of FTX’s collapse, Bitcoin price plunged to as low as $15,500. Nevertheless, BTC’s price has been on a gradual ascent and is back up by more than 120% since the market crash. This steady price rise reflects the cryptocurrency’s robust nature and its ability to bounce back from unforeseen setbacks. Bitcoin Price Overview The Bitcoin price has been on a tear in the past weeks, rallying by more than 25% in the last month. However, it is worth noting that the premier cryptocurrency has somewhat slowed down in the past few days, with only a 1.9% price increase in the past week.

Your passion fuels the Cardano ecosystem!💪 pic.twitter.com/g3YTNJyCgO — Input Output (@InputOutputHK) November 4, 2023 Two years ago, the Cardano ecosystem celebrated its full decentralization as stake pool operators took over block production. Now, the ecosystem continues to move in that direction by implementing capabilities that will help the community retain that power. Sebastian Zilliacus from Emurgo, a Cardano-based entity operating as their communication and educational arm, presented their vision to migrate social media platforms from centralized to decentralized environments. In that way, users would finally break free from the control of third parties and can truly “own their identities.” In addition, teams presented tokenization solutions that could allow everyone to own a piece of precious metal and other “real-world assets” and ways to support displaced people by providing them with financial support using staking pools.

Ahmed was the master of ceremonies on the Innovation Stage. He has attended the last three Cardano Summits while helping with the ecosystem in different endeavors, including Emurgo and its marketing and educational efforts. This is what he told us about AI and Blockchain: (…) blockchain as a data management system can benefit from having AI integrated within it. I think that’s a really important part. I think it also kind of has the ability that blockchain and that we can use blockchain as an underlying for AI. So I think the two go really well together (…). A New Way To Fund Projects On Cardano On the other hand, the community was looking forward to the debate around funding and financial support. As Ahmed explained, funding in the Cardano ecosystem mostly takes place via Project Catalyst, which has seen some delays during the Bear Market. In that sense, the debate focused on incentivizing Venture Capitalist firms and external funding to onboard the Cardano ecosystem. Ahmed said: (…) cutting off funding can be cutting off the oxygen out of startups. And so they are looking at other ways of kind of funding. Charles Hodkinson gave an interesting analogy to this where he was like, well, the treasury at the Foundation Foundation, Cardano as a whole is kind of like a big reservoir of water. Catalyst is the only pipe at the moment able to release the treasury and support the community. And that through CIP 1694, which is the Voltaire Era, which will be the new governance mechanism to allow for things to operate a bit more autonomously, will allow for the community to be able to distribute treasury in a much more facilitated manner. And so I think there is a lot of community excited about that because it means that the flood gates are open or will be open and it will allow for projects, the community and other things to be funded in a better way. Once again, the Cardano ecosystem seems to be preparing for the next cycle from different angles by supporting developers today, incentivizing more developers to work on their blockchain, and keeping a strong community. Related Reading: Cardano Summit 2023: A Chat With SingulariyNET, Staking Announcement These elements could play out for the Cardano ecosystem during the next Bull Cycle, allowing it to gain an advantage over Polkadot, Solana, and other networks. Ahmed concluded: We’ll just have to wait and see. And it depends on the wisdom of the community and where they decide to spend their resources (…). If they have a better distribution of funds and in a more long-term mindset where they’re not just spending the whole treasury in a year, two years, but they have a 10 to 20 year mindset, I think things can really happen.

That is why he sees the token as “exponential gold.” Related Reading: Legal Expert Explains Why Ripple Will Always Back XRP Source: X He further elaborated on Bitcoin’s adoption curve, stating that it has so far followed a “typical S-curve shape,” which places it in good company with other major innovations that went through such an adoption journey. One of them is mobile phones, as Timmer noted that Bitcoin’s adoption curve in 2020 resembled that of mobile phones in the ‘80s and ‘90s. Source: X Bitcoin, however, seems to have moved to another stage in the adoption curve, as Timmer stated that the “real-rate narrative changed from dovish in 2020 to hawkish in 2022.” He further suggested that Bitcoin has moved past the stage of a rapid rise as its adoption curve has flattened out. With this, Timmer believes that it now shares similarities with the adoption curve of the internet in the 2000s as the crypto token “has not made much progress since 2021.” Bitcoin Volatility: Good Or Bad? In a subsequent post, Timmer put Bitcoin’s volatility in perspective as he compared it with other asset classes. First, he shared a risk-reward chart for the pandemic and post-pandemic era ranging from 2020 to this year. The SPX seemed to provide the best risk-reward with close to 24% return. Source: X Timmer then went on to share another chart, which included Bitcoin this time around. The foremost cryptocurrency notably stood out from the rest, as he mentioned that Bitcoin was “in a different universe,” with a 58% return. Source: X Related Reading: Will Cardano Replicate Solana’s Surge? Analyst Reveals Similarities For 80% Rise Bitcoin’s high volatility seems to have contributed to such returns in no small way, as Timmer mentioned that the crypto token’s huge drawdowns also come with large gains. To drive home his point, he shared another chart that showed drawdowns and rallies, which various asset classes have experienced from their 2-year high and low, respectively. Source: X The chart showed that Bitcoin experienced a 54% drawdown from its two-year high but is also up by 84% from its low in the same period. This is more impressive when one considers how other asset classes have fared in the same period as Timmer stated that Government bonds “can’t hold a candle” to Bitcoin’s risk-reward math.

19786318,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559129,1699099225,"XRP Unlikely To Suffer From Ripple IPO, Crypto Author Says","Amid multiple speculations on the effects of Ripple potentially launching an initial public offering (IPO), popular crypto author Panos Mekras has come out to dispel concerns about this development, yielding a negative effect on the XRP token. Related Reading: XRP Price Rally Threatened As Ripple Unlocks 1 Billion Tokens Ripple IPO Will Lead To More Exposure For XRP, Mekras Says On Friday, November 3, crypto analyst and trader Mason Versluis shared a screenshot on X in which a crypto enthusiast argued that a Ripple IPO would result in the “death of XRP.” Although the enthusiast did admit that XRP may initially experience a price surge following the confirmed news of such development, he also suspects that Ripple’s “manipulation” of the altcoin will increase. In contrast, Versluis stated that a Ripple IPO should only boost the interest in XRP. However, he does admit the possibility of the “other side.” Reacting to Versluis’ post, Panos Mekras, stamped out the potential of a Ripple IPO causing any negative effect on XRP. He stated that Ripple inviting public investors would result in a bigger exposure for the company and the XRP token. In addition, Mekras also implied that XRP functions as a “universal digital asset” with several use cases possessing an “unlimited potential”; thus, its trajectory cannot be solely tied to Ripple, which is just one company. For now, these takes can be considered as only speculations as Ripple has not even officially confirmed its intention to launch an IPO. News surrounding the payment company’s “alleged” preparation to go public rose to a new height on Friday after crypto analyst Lewis Jackson posted a video on YouTube highlighting multiple signs of an incoming IPO. In this YouTube post, Jackson spoke about the notable increase in Ripple’s mergers and acquisitions (M&A), which is a common activity with companies anticipating an IPO. He also pointed to Ripple’s current recruitment activities in which the company is looking for a director of international tax and a shareholder communication senior manager, among others, all of which are roles that are indicative of impending IPO.

19783652,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559115,1699092030,Bitcoin And Ethereum:  Crypto Pundit Says Expect A Repeat Of Massive 2019 Rally,"Partner at the Venture Capital firm Placeholder Capital and prominent figure in the crypto community, Chris Burniske, has given an instance where assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum could see a repeat of what happened in mid-2019. New Highs Before A “Final Wipeout” In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Burniske mentioned that a repeat of mid-2019 could happen if the top two cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, were to “rip” from their current levels. If that happens, the crypto founder believes that the broader crypto market could follow suit. Related Reading: XRP And Shiba Inu Rally Is Not Over According To This Indicator As to how these crypto tokens could go, he noted that they could rise enough to make people believe that they could hit new all-time highs soon, but that may not be the case as these investors could endure a “final wipeout” soon after (possibly in the first quarter of next year) with these tokens steady declining to higher lows. To drive home his point, Burniske suggested that Bitcoin and Ethereum’s current price action shared similarities to the period between December 2019 and January 2019 before the “painful descent into March 2020 lows.” According to him, although that period was the COVID era, “everything is also the same about the actors on the stage.” Burniske seemed to be certain about his assertions. In a subsequent post, he warned investors that the rollercoaster “could get extreme” in relation to what he had said earlier and urged them to have their seatbelts on. ETH price sitting at $1,844 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Market Cycle And Macro Factors Affecting Bitcoin And Ethereum Many didn’t seem to react well to Burniske’s projections, considering that it could mean that the crypto market and everyone in it could be in more pain, even if a massive rally (as the crypto founder predicts) is likely to happen before that. A particular X user, however, seemed to agree with his position as he stated that Burniske’s prediction makes so much sense as that is how the “cycle psychology” works, just that this time, it happens to line up “perfectly” with some highly likely macro scenarios. Burniske responded to the post as he agreed that those were the points he was trying to drive home. Related Reading: ProShares Goes Short On Ethereum With New ETF Launch One of these macro scenarios, which was alluded to, could be the rising inflation and how the Federal Reserve and other authorities globally are increasing interest rates to battle the economic downturn. Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone had once mentioned how Bitcoin could crash to $10,000, with inflation being one of the factors that could lead to the decline. Another crypto analyst, Nicholas Merten, had also noted that Bitcoin could decline further if the Feds do not do enough to curb the rising inflation.

This is an amazing increment in price. But caution is advised since RUNE, an altcoin, seems overbought, possibly signaling a 20% drop in the near future. At the time of writing, RUNE was trading at $3.42, climbing over 15% in the last 24 hours, and registering an impressive 37% rally in the last seven days, figures by CoinMarketCap shows. Related Reading: This Chainlink Metric Just Hit Meteoric Levels – Good News For LINK Price? RUNE: Potential To Reverse Bearish Trajectory If RUNE closes above the psychological $3.500 mark, it could negate the present downturn and cause the bearish attitude to change. The significance of RUNE closing above the critical $3.500 mark lies in its potential to reverse the prevailing bearish trend and trigger a shift in market sentiment. Achieving this milestone could signify a break in the current downtrend, potentially instigating a more positive outlook among investors and traders. Source: CoinMarketCap THORChain underwent a notable phase of consolidation, a period marked by relatively stable prices and limited fluctuations. Following this consolidation, the market witnessed a substantial surge, propelling THORChain’s price upwards by over 40%. However, in the aftermath of this surge, the price has demonstrated a consistent stability, remaining within a relatively similar range. This stability has coincided with a broader downturn in market dynamics, where fluctuations and overall activity have shown a decrease across the market. Despite the prior surge, THORChain’s price has maintained a consistent level, reflecting a degree of resilience amid the current market trends. RUNE market cap currently at $1.16 billion on the weekend chart: TradingView.com The RUNE token holds a substantial long-term liquidation value surpassing $70 million, signifying a considerable reserve or potential value inherent in the token’s existence. However, a cautionary note emerges from the chart analysis, which reveals a prominent positive deviation highlighted in green. 3. $RUNE LIQUIDATION LEVEL analysis: – More than 70M in futures liquidations. Green DELTA, means confluence to short. – More than 1M in Liquidation profile between 2.75$ and 2.65$ (support) – PA and MS is bearish. There’s more liquidity below than above, at current price. pic.twitter.com/48j9hI5h35 — CryptoSoulz (@SoulzBTC) November 2, 2023 This deviation might signify an impending decrease in price in the near future, suggesting a potential shift or correction in the market valuation of the token. This could prompt investors to stay vigilant and consider potential fluctuations in the token’s value in their future investment decisions. The price of RUNE garnered significant attention subsequent to a substantial market surge, as the cryptocurrency experienced a portfolio increase of more than 40% inside that period. Related Reading: Solana Bulls Are Charging – Could $50 Be Just Around The Corner? Signs Of Market Correction For RUNE? Analyzing the technical indicators, THORChain reveals an RSI figure of 72.24, typically signaling overbought conditions when surpassing 70. This situation hints at the possibility of profit-taking or a slight downturn in the coming days. Despite indicating a robust bullish sentiment with an RSI above 50, THORChain might be treading into overextended territory, potentially requiring cautious observation for signs of a market correction or adjustment. Source: Santiment Meanwhile, according to Santiment’s research, there is a decline in the social dominance of the RUNE cryptocurrency, which means there is less of a presence and conversation on social media. When conversations do happen, they usually center on the altcoin’s remarkable rise, which may allude to investor anticipation of an upcoming fall. In line with this reality is the rising open interest, which is the sum of all long and short positions in the market. After such a meteoric increase of 120%, short sellers should outnumber long sellers for RUNE among traders. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice. Investing involves risk.

According to the announcement, the action aligns with the G7’s commitment to closing loopholes that allow Russian state actors, oligarchs, and proxies to exploit virtual currency to circumvent international sanctions. Crypto Money Laundering Exposed Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Brian E. Nelson emphasized the alleged role played by key facilitators like Zhdanova in aiding Russian elites, ransomware groups, and other illicit actors in evading US and international sanctions through the abuse of cryptocurrencies. Nelson stated that the Treasury remains steadfast in its efforts to safeguard the global financial system against such exploitation and other risks within the crypto ecosystem. Related Reading: Cardano Summit 2023: A Chat With SingulariyNET, Staking Announcement Allegedly, Zhdanova’s involvement in obfuscating the source of wealth for a Russian client, enabling the transfer of over $2.3 million into Western Europe via fraudulent investment accounts and real estate purchases, drew OFAC’s attention. Zhdanova’s services provided sanctioned Russian individuals access to Western financial markets that would otherwise be restricted due to US and international prohibitions. The US Treasury Department alleges that such illicit financial activities enable the evasion of multilateral sanctions and undermine efforts to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked war and aggression. Utilizing cryptocurrencies as a facilitator of large cross-border transactions, Zhdanova relied on entities lacking Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) controls, including the OFAC-designated Russian cryptocurrency exchange, Garantex Europe OU. Zhdanova employed various methods to transfer funds internationally, including cash transactions and leveraging connections with other money laundering associates and organizations. Additionally, she utilized traditional businesses, such as a luxury watch company with global offices, to maintain access to the international financial system. Furthermore, it is alleged that Zhdanova conducted crypto exchange transfers on behalf of oligarchs who relocated internationally, facilitating the movement of over $100 million to the United Arab Emirates. Unveiling The Scheme Zhdanova also provided a tax residency service in the UAE to Russian clients, potentially participating in identity obfuscation. This service offered clients a UAE tax residency, identification card, and bank account, with payments made in cash or virtual currency, subsequently transferred to foreign bank accounts at the client’s discretion. Notably, Zhdanova’s services extended to individuals associated with the notorious Russian Ryuk ransomware group. Zhdanova allegedly laundered approximately $2.3 million in suspected victim payments for a Ryuk ransomware affiliate, which has targeted numerous victims worldwide, including the United States, particularly in the healthcare sector. Related Reading: $113 Million In Longs Get Rekt As Bitcoin Plunges Back To $34,000 As a consequence of this action, all US persons must report any property or interests in property belonging to Zhdanova or any entities directly or indirectly owned by her.

This Analyst Thinks So,"FTM, the native currency of the Fantom ecosystem, might be the next coin to follow and perhaps outperform Solana (SOL). This optimistic preview is by one technical analyst, “Magnate,” who, in an X post on October 3, said traders who missed the SOL rally may have a chance with FTM. Solana Is Exploding: Reverses Post-FTX Losses At press time, SOL is trading at new 2023 highs and has reversed all post-FTX losses. Changing hands at $39 as of writing on November 3, the SOL uptrend remains, looking at the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart. Specifically, SOL is up 125% from September lows and 190% from June 2023 highs. At this pace, SOL has outpaced Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), two of the world’s largest cryptocurrencies. This is despite Bitcoin, buoyed by the broader crypto’s optimism of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the coming weeks. The general confidence is despite the SEC laying out a potential timeframe for when this product will go live. Related Reading: Ripple Achieves Regulatory Approval To Offer XRP Services Looking at the SOL daily chart, primary support is around the November 2022 high at around $36–a key reaction line traders are closely monitoring. As it is, there has been a cool-off, but traders are confident of a pullback, pushing the coin back higher in a bullish breakout formation. Is Fantom (FTM) Preparing For A 100% Surge? Magnate, sharing the daily and weekly charts of FTM, noted that the coin appears to be bouncing off a critical support zone. In the weekly chart, the uptrend is defined. FTM is picking momentum, edging higher as confidence, partly due to fundamental events and the recovery across the board, is changing sentiment, propping bulls. Related Reading: This Chainlink Metric Just Hit Meteoric Levels – Good News For LINK Price? From the daily chart, FTM found support at 2022 lows before edging higher to spot rates.

Even so, only time will tell if FTM will track SOL, lifting off by over 100%, as the technical analyst predicts. Although there have been some challenges, there are also some positive developments taking place. One such development is that Messari, an analytics platform, recently observed a surge in Fantom’s on-chain activity. According to their findings, the average number of new addresses added to the network daily increased by 106% in the last quarter. In comparison, the average number of active addresses per day rose by 3% in the same period.
