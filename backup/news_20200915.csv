Peirce issued a public dissent after the SEC levied a $6.1 million fine on online gaming and gambling platform Unikrn for conducting an initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017, a penalty that effectively amounts to the size of the company's current assets.    Peirce said that not only did she disagree with the SEC's finding Unikrn committed a registration violation, imposing a penalty that large will have a chilling effect on innovation on the part of other firms.  ""We should strive to avoid enforcement actions and sanctions, however, that enervate innovation and stifle the economic growth that innovation brings,"" the commissioner said. ""I believe that this action and its accompanying sanctions will have such consequences.""  Peirce used the opportunity to try to gain support for her ""safe harbor"" proposal that would allow companies like Unikrn a three-year window to experiment and perfect their platforms without fear of running afoul of regulators in this new area of finance.  ""Imagine if such a regulatory safe harbor had been available to Unikrn,"" Peirce said. ""Instead of permanently disabling its tokens as a result of today’s settled enforcement action, Unikrn, in concert with its token holders, might be devoting its time and resources to identifying new uses for the token and expanding its user base.""

Read More: Two Charged With Duping Investors of $5M With Bogus Bitcoin Brokerage      “BTC is making a strong attempt to break out of the recent $10,100 to $10,500 range,” said David Lifchitz, chief investment officer of quant firm ExoAlpha. “We’re just above $10,600 and testing $10,600-$10,800 long enough would position the next target to $11,000.”      Lifchitz cited factors other than just price as reasons to be optimistic about the world’s oldest cryptocurrency. “From a fundamental point of view, bitcoin mining hashrate is hitting all-time highs,” Lifchitz added. Indeed, the daily average hashrate on the Bitcoin network reached a records 151 million terahashes per second on Monday.      The rise in hashrate means the next difficulty adjustment, scheduled for Sept. 19, will also likely set a record high. “Difficulty is looking to adjust upwards later this week to its highest ever,” added Lifchitz.

Hirsch attributes some of this bitcoin activity coming from decentralized finance, or DeFi, which can require movement of BTC on-chain. ”We have witnessed more capital going into DeFi projects despite some of them experiencing major issues, and also an increase in bitcoin locked on DeFi,” Hirsch told CoinDesk. “These developments suggest that there has been an increase in HODLing as people and institutions show an increasing willingness to allocate to crypto assets.”      Read More: Japanese Crypto Exchange Accuses Binance of Helping Launder $9M    100K BTC locked in DeFi    The amount of bitcoin “locked,” or deployed, in DeFi has crossed the 100,000 mark for the first time, currently at 101,719 BTC, according to aggregator DeFi Pulse.

It’s kind of mind-blowing,” said Henrik Kugelberg, a Sweden-based bitcoin over-the-counter trader. Kugelberg expects a lot more BTC on DeFi in the future. “While 100,000 BTC is a lot of money it is actually a small part of mined BTC locked in DeFi.

42405053,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKmum,1600201921,Tassat Gains CFTC 'No-Action' Relief Ahead of Eventual Bitcoin Swaps Contract Listing,"Tassat Derivatives plans to list a bitcoin swaps contract in late 2020 despite a bevy of delays that caused the firm's Swaps Execution Facility (SEF) registration to fall dormant.    The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Tuesday pledged not to punish Tassat if it premieres its contract before regaining SEF registration by granting the firm no-action relief.  Tassat, which seeks to list a physically deliverable bitcoin swaps contract, had been working under the SEF registration it acquired last November from now-defunct swaps exchange trueEX.  But the CFTC deemed Tassat's registration dormant on Aug. 1. for failing to execute any swaps over 12 consecutive months (trueEX's last trade was in July 2019), forcing Tassat to petition for relief.  Tassat blamed the swaps listing delay on: leadership changes at the CFTC, an executive exodus at Tassat (former CEO Thomas Kim departed in March), COVID-19 onboarding troubles and other pandemic-related pains.  ""Tassat states, despite the delays, it has not stopped working on, and preparing for, the launch of its bitcoin swap contract,"" the CFTC said in the letter granting no-action relief.  The Tuesday order will effectively allow Tassat to list its swaps contract prior to CFTC's final ruling on a yet-to-be-filed reinstatement request, according to a Tassat spokesperson, who said the procedure can take up to six months.

42405062,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKn3d,1600199828,"Discreet Log Contracts Are Bringing Private, ‘Scriptless’ Smart Contracts to Bitcoin","“Republican_win”; “Democratic_win.” These are the parameters (and call functions) for the first smart contract escrowed bet placed on Bitcoin’s mainnet.      On Sept. 8, BTCPay Server founder Nicolas Dorier and Suredbits founder Chris Stewart entered the bet on the 2020 U.S. presidential election outcome using a discreet log contract (DLC), a form of smart contract that became feasible on Bitcoin just this year, thanks to independent Bitcoin developer Lloyd Fournier’s technical advancements in the realm of so-called “scriptless-scripts” on Bitcoin’s blockchain.      As for who took which side of the bet, Dorier and Stewart didn’t say. Even after Election Day when the votes are tallied we still won’t know who won the bet. And that’s very much the point.      Otherwise, the contracts wouldn’t be discreet.    What are discreet log contracts?    Described by developer Gert-Jaap Glasbergen as “invisible smart contracts,” discreet log contracts are structured to look like standard multi-signature transactions on Bitcoin’s blockchain. If someone were searching for the transaction on the ledger, they would have no way of knowing it’s a smart contract or, in Dorier and Stewart’s case, the details of the bet.      These smart contracts have theoretically been feasible since Bitcoin’s inception, but groundbreaking work with ECDSA adapter signatures (a cryptographic signature scheme that enables “scriptless scripts” to execute smart contracts without relying on Bitcoin’s scripting language) in the past year has brought them from theory to application.      Read more: RGB Continues Its Work to Bring Better Smart Contracts to Bitcoin      “Technically DLCs could have been done since the original release, but a lot of the building blocks weren’t known back then. For instance, for DLCs we use ECDSA adapter signatures, whose application for this use case wasn’t discovered until this year [by Lloyd Fournier],” Suredbits developer Ben Carman told CoinDesk.      Suredbits is one of the primary actors pioneering DLC development along with Crypto Garage, Atomic Loans, Square Crypto-funded independent developer Loyd Fornier, and Chaincode Labs developer Antoine Riard.      The structure of a DLC transaction is pretty straightforward. Building on the bet between Dorier and Stewart, two parties send funds to a multi-signature address. In order to settle the transaction, an oracle would sign the contract with a signature that corresponds to the hash of the winning outcome (in this case, either Republican_Win or Democrat_Win).      The person with the hash that corresponds with the oracle’s signature can then withdraw the funds from the contract.      In Carman’s words, “It’s fancy cryptography to show that your contract is based on the oracle signature and you can only spend the funds if you have that valid oracle signature.”    DLC development is young but promising    Carman said DLCs are “still super early,” so much so that the teams working on them are still creating libraries for coding specifications.      He added that DLCs could even find a home on the Lightning Network, but this would take some advancements considering that current implementations are not hard coded to accommodate ECDSA adapter signatures.      Accommodating ECDSA on Lightning would require the addition of point-time-lock-contracts (PTLCs), an in-the-works upgraded version of the hash-time-lock-contracts that currently operate on Lightning.      Schnorr signatures would be an ideal base for implementing PTLCs. The long-awaited Schnorr/Taproot upgrade is essential still for DLCs in general, Carman said. Even though DLCs can be executed today, more advanced use cases will be much easier to implement if Bitcoin’s codebase receives a boost from the Schnorr/Taproot softfork.      Read more: Bitcoin’s Future: Exactly How a Coming Upgrade Could Improve Privacy and Scaling    DLC use cases    “Betting will be the primary use-case in the beginning – so, elections, sports and what-have-you,” Carman told CoinDesk. “Once it’s more established and we have a market for defining counterparties for trades, there will be use-cases for hedging or synthetic assets.”      The hedging use case is outlined by Glasbergen in his “Invisible smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain” blog post. The “forward contracts” would entail two parties entering a DLC, with one party agreeing to purchase a certain amount of bitcoin (BTC) for an agreed-upon price, and the other party providing the liquidity for this purchase.

42405066,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKn7Z,1600197727,"Binance, Huobi, OKEx Have FOMO for DeFi","Decentralized finance (DeFi) has been grabbing the headlines and capturing the imagination of traders in recent weeks and some of the biggest centralized cryptocurrency exchanges seem to be afraid they’re missing out.      That's why they are now trying to reposition themselves as integral parts of this exploding sector, particularly as traders in China grow more interested in DeFi.      Huobi announced Tuesday it was adding 10 more members to its DeFi initiative, described as “a consortium of centralized and decentralized financial services providers.”      Archrival OKEx, which launched its OKExChain blockchain earlier this year, boasted Monday that with its latest upgrade the network is the most decentralized public chain powered by exchanges.      Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, last week announced a new integration of its centralized platform, Binance.com, and its decentralized public blockchain, Binance Smart Chain (BSC). There’s a $100 million fund to encourage developers to build DeFi projects on BSC after the company’s last take on DeFi, Binance Dex – a decentralized exchange launched a year and a half ago – generated little traction.      Centralized exchanges’ aggressive moves into the rapidly growing DeFi space suggest decentralization may be their inevitable path for survival in a crypto trading landscape where decentralized exchanges (DEX) are stealing greater market share.      CEXs vs. DEXs      Centralized exchanges (CEX) are connected to blockchain networks but use their own computers to match cryptocurrency traders’ buy or sell orders. When one buys and holds a cryptocurrency on a CEX, the coin is often in a centralized address by the exchange. All that happens is a ledger balance change at the exchange itself. “Not your keys, not your coins” is a refrain often used to warn that anyone buying from an exchange isn’t in control so long as he or she doesn't also have the private keys. Those who traded on Mt. Gox in 2014 learned that lesson the hard way when the exchange collapsed and hundreds of thousands of bitcoins went missing from its hot wallet.      Read more: New Index From DeFi Pulse and Set Protocol Offers Easy Access to 10 DeFi Tokens in 1      Compared to a centralized exchange, a DEX, in theory, gives more freedom to its users. Decentralized exchanges are usually constructed atop blockchain networks. Automated market makers (AMMs) enable trades to be executed automatically through smart contracts without relying on a third party such as a centralized exchange. Traders also have the full control of their funds and their crypto. They are not required to go through any know-your-customer (KYC) verifications.      While both decentralized and centralized exchanges have been around since the early days of bitcoin itself, centralized exchanges dominated trading and mostly competed against each other. With the sudden boom in DeFi, DEXs are growing faster than their centralized counterparts.      The recent phenomenon of “yield farming” – where users get token rewards for participating in DeFi systems – has made it easier for traders to maximize returns, as CoinDesk reported previously.      When Uniswap, a semi-automated platform where traders can buy and sell cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, surpassed CEX Coinbase Pro to become the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volume at the beginning of September, the DEX platform also saw a more than ten-fold gain on its trading volume over the previous month.      In August alone, DEXs represented 5% of total crypto exchange volumes, as AMMs like Uniswap, Curve and Balancer accounted for over 90% of total DEX volume, according to a Sept. 14 report by the cryptocurrency-analysis firm Messari.    China in play?    Binance, OKEx, and Huobi, the three centralized exchanges making some of the biggest splashes in DeFi, are also among the most popular exchanges with Chinese users, with deep roots in China, where interest in DeFi has been on an upswing.      The first steps of the Huobi-backed Global DeFi Alliance, according to a press statement by Sharlyn Wu, chief investment officer at Huobi, will be to host a series of events that will help “educate Asian users of various DeFi protocols.”      “These will be opportunities for Alliance members to collaborate with other branches within the Huobi ecosystem to bootstrap use interest in Asia,” Wu said.      Huobi’s DeFi initiative has included some of the biggest DeFi players including Compound, Curve, Aave, Balancer, and Maker Foundation.      Read more: Chainlink to Start Supplying Data for Crypto.com’s DeFi Wallet      There is also a so-called “withdrawal movement” in China, according to a tweet by Dovey Wan, a partner at crypto asset investment fund Primitive Ventures and an adviser to CoinDesk. She said users are withdrawing their crypto assets from centralized exchanges and transferring them to lucrative yield farming on DeFi.      According to Simons Chen, executive director of investment and trading crypto finance institution Babel Finance, based in Hong Kong, investors in China were cautious in the early boom of DeFi, during what he called its “first wave.” Many were burned in the initial coin offering (ICO) mania in 2017. But with the drama of SushiSwap ending DeFi’s first wave, investors recognize the potential of the space and are now rushing to join what they perceive as “the second wave” of DeFi, Chen told CoinDesk in a phone interview.      Other than the high returns from yield farming, Chen said Chinese investors also enjoy another advantage of DeFi: having control of their own funds, which reduces the risks of exchanges’ exit scams.      “It’s a lot of pressure for centralized exchanges,” Chen said, recognizing the recent withdrawal trend among cryptocurrency holders in China.      Chen explained that centralized exchanges have huge exposure to margin trading, which allows traders to leverage their positions with borrowed funds. Should more assets leave for DeFi, the centralized exchanges could be left in the lurch.    CEX DeFi FOMO    DEXs have some advantages, even for the centralized exchanges trying to run one on the side.      “It’s always better to disrupt yourself than having somebody else disrupt you first,” said Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, during his company's recent World of DeFi summit.      He noted the cost of running a decentralized exchange is much cheaper for a company and, therefore, users usually pay less fee to trade on the decentralized platforms. He said he is anticipating Binance Smart Chain, the Ethereum-compatible DEX, will supplement the centralized exchange.      “On the Binance Smart Chain, there are already a number of really interesting projects leveraging automated market makers and DEXs. And on the smart chain, the DEXes, the AMMs will also provide liquidity for Binance’s orderbook,” he said.      While that may appear promising, some argue this is just Binance’s latest effort to keep up with DeFi after the exchange's initial efforts failed to gain traction.      Jay Hao, CEO of OKEx, also acknowledged the success of DeFi and the eagerness of his exchange to be part of that success.      “One of OKEx’s core missions is to act as a bridge between high-quality DeFi products and the wider user group,” Jay Hao, CEO of OKEx said in an email response to CoinDesk. “It’s impossible to ignore the compelling promise of DeFi and we are firm believers that it will succeed.”      Read more: Uniswap Takes Lead Over SushiSwap Less Than 24 Hours After SUSHI Rewards Drop      The latest version of OKEx’s public chain is said to have higher transactions per second than the Ethereum network, according to the Malta-based exchange’s news release on Sept. 14. The chain is also designed to be compatible with Ethereum.      That could be a smart move, according to Three Arrows Capital CEO Su Zhu. With Ethereum's soaring transaction fees and network congestion, potential demand for non-Ethereum DeFi could be the next big market trend, he said to CoinDesk via a Telegram message.    What CEXs can get    Centralized exchanges face a dilemma growing their own DEXs and getting involved with DeFi: They can cannibalize their own businesses or they can indirectly prove these DEXs at their core are not truly decentralized. After all, the exchanges are for-profit businesses and not philanthropic foundations.      “As DeFi continues to grow, the centralized exchanges will end up acting like a white label,” Three Arrows Capital’s Zhu said. “Centralized exchanges (would be) a gateway to DeFi, but not where users ultimately spend their time.”      When asked to describe the relationship between OKEx and DeFi and how they could work together despite fundamental differences, OKEx’s Hao said that even if DEXs eventually prove they are the future, CEXs will also be part of that future.      “It is our belief at OKEx that DeFi will help us achieve the goal of ‘FinanceAll,’” Hao said. “As we believe there will always be room for traditional financial services, there will always be a need for centralized exchanges like ours.”      Binance's Zhao, meanwhile, offered an answer of how his company can survive in a truly decentralized business model: its native token BNB.      “I will be really happy on the day when decentralized exchanges replace centralized exchanges and I think that will push our overall mission forward,” he said during his company's recent virtual summit. “When that happens, our centralized entity may not be worth much less but BNB will be worth much more. So we don’t lose that much.”      Yet, that will require these centralized exchanges to give over control of their operations to the token holders, according to Zhu, in order for their native tokens to become “fully DeFi.”      Read more: DeFi Is Hot but Retail Interest Nowhere Close to ICO Frenzy      Babel Finance’s Chen compared the CEXs’ take on DeFi with oil companies buying natural gas companies' stocks when natural gas first challenged their dominance in the energy sector. The centralized exchanges are in the similar mindset as those oil giants: If DeFi and DEXes replace centralized exchanges, centralized exchanges would still be able to catch some part of that market share, Chen said.      Then again, that depends on whether DeFi survives the current high-risk and high-return craze. For the time being, if not longer, centralized exchanges will still likely dominate the crypto trading market.      “I know for sure most of the DeFi projects will fail. It’s just a matter of fact,” Zhao said. “(But) I don’t think DeFi will fail as an industry. A small number of projects will be hugely successful in the future.”",NEUTRAL,BNB,ASIA | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB | TOKEN SALE,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/15/binance-huobi-okex-have-fomo-for-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c14da9b9d48665eee1506aad3c58f57bd4f56a85-1500x996.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405054,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKmwk,1600197191,Crypto Esports Startup Unikrn to Pay $6.1M in SEC Settlement Over 2017 ICO,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) settled unregistered securities offering charges against online gaming and gambling platform Unikrn for conducting an initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017. Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, an outspoken advocate for cryptocurrencies, dissented.      According to a press release Tuesday, the SEC alleged that between June and October 2017, Unikrn Inc. raised approximately $31 million through the UnikoinGold (UKG) token sale in violation of registration requirements.      The SEC’s press release said that while the firm promised to use its funds to add more features to the platform and develop additional applications, it failed to register the sale of said tokens, which the SEC alleges were offered as investment contracts.      The statement adds that Unikrn has agreed to settle the charges, without admitting or denying them, by paying a $6.1 million penalty to be distributed among investors. The SEC said the $6.1 million accounts for “substantially all of the company’s assets.”      “This resolution allows us to return substantially all of Unikrn’s assets to already-harmed investors and includes measures to prevent future sales to retail investors,” Kristina Littman, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Cyber Unit, said in a statement.      Dissenting Commissioner Peirce noted that Unikrn wasn't accused of committing any fraud, just a registration violation. Peirce said that not only did she not believe there was a violation, imposing a penalty that large will have a chilling effect on innovation on the part of other firms.      ""The commission is effectively forcing the company to cease operations because of an allegedly improper offering of supposed securities,"" Peirce said, who used the opportunity to try to gain support for her ""safe harbor"" proposal that would allow companies like Unikrn a three-year window to experiment and perfect their platforms without fear of running afoul of regulators in this new area of finance.  In a statement shared with CoinDesk, Unikrn CEO Rahul Sood didn't give any indication the demise of his firm is imminent. Sood said his firm “spent months working with the SEC to come to a solution that was about moving the business forward,” adding:    “The common ground we found requires Unikrn to completely stop supporting UKG and help provide a fund for purchasers of UnikoinGold. This gives us clearance to focus on continuing to build our industry-leading business.”    Unikrn’s statement in response to the SEC’s charges added the firm will continue to offer its services supported by major currencies, including fiat currencies, bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH) and USDC, among others.      In a related matter, the SEC said Seattle-based Unikrn has settled charges brought by the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions for violating state regulations on such offerings.

42405060,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKmzh,1600195056,Bitcoin CEO: MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor Explains His $425M Bet on BTC,"MicroStrategy is prepared to HODL its bitcoin for at least a century.      Or so said the business intelligence firm’s founder and CEO, Michael Saylor, in an interview with CoinDesk on Tuesday, shortly after he announced on Twitter that MicroStrategy was doubling down on the godfather cryptocurrency with the purchase of $175 million more BTC.      “I want something that I could put $425 million into for 100 years,” Saylor told CoinDesk.      In the last two months Saylor has transformed his company’s once-sleepy cash surplus into a nearly half-billion-dollar bet on bitcoin, the “digital gold” Saylor is certain will outlast his tenure.      “If [my successor is] staring at this thing, it’s still working,” he said.      “This thing” is a heaping pile of 38,250 bitcoins. The publicly traded firm bought $250 million worth on Aug. 11, days after telling shareholders that cash was no longer a safe place for its excess $500 million. Tuesday morning, it bought $175 million more.      Read more: MicroStrategy Buys $175M More in Bitcoin, Upping BTC Holdings to $425M      Forget about parking the balance sheet surplus in inflation-prone cash or low-yield bonds or overextended tech stocks, Saylor said. In a market like this – and in the future he said is certain to come – there are only two good places to put excess cash to work: stock buybacks and bitcoin.      It’s a radical about-face for a man who seven years ago declared bitcoin’s days were numbered.      What sparked the change?    An unlikely revelation    “I went down the rabbit hole” during COVID-19, Saylor said, admitting he “was wrong” to have doubted bitcoin back in the $600 range.      “I wish I knew then what I know now,” he said.      The first step in his journey to conversion came from an unlikely source for a newly minted bitcoin maximalist: The sale of the “Voice.com” domain to EOS creator Block.one for $30 million in July 2019.      Fast forward to 2020, and Saylor found himself reading up on bitcoin. He learned as much about crypto as fast as he could. Saylor said he pored over essays by “bitcoin luminaries,” listened to Nathaniel Whittemore’s and Anthony Pompliano’s crypto podcasts, scoured the internet for Peter Schiff’s bitcoin debates with Erik Voorhees and lost himself in Andreas Antonopoulos’ media empire.      COVID-19’s global business woes were actually a boon for MicroStrategy. Saylor said the firm soon realized it had far more cash on hand than it needed to operate in a newly streamlined virtual-first world.      Moving away from the dollar is now Saylor’s primary concern. He said he can’t stand the inflationary risk.      In bitcoin, he and the firm’s decision-makers have found what they deem the obvious choice for the coming century of QE infinity.      “I started to cheerfully assign homework” to MicroStrategy’s executives and directors, Saylor said. He staged “a series of learning exercises to bring everyone up to speed.” If MicroStrategy was really going to move millions into bitcoin, then everyone had to be on board.    How to go all-in    There was a lot of ground to cover, Saylor said. But in three months’ time, he and his executives had accrued the crypto education, and dealt with the myriad legal, custodial and security issues that he said stand in the way of publicly traded companies getting into crypto.      Then, in late July, executives unveiled the game plan on the firm’s Q2 earnings call: MicroStrategy would seek to invest up to $250 million in the next 12 months “in one or more alternative investments or assets which may include stocks, bonds, commodities such as gold, digital assets such as [b]itcoin, or other asset types,” MicroStrategy resident Phong Li said on July 28.      It was a declaration so clouded in corporate vagueness that nobody really noticed the news.      A week passed before Castle Island Ventures partner Matt Walsh resurfaced the earnings call transcript in a tweet. He noted how the Nasdaq-traded stock was “diversifying its cash holdings to include bitcoin.”      Walsh gave the news a double-eye emoji. Watch this, he was saying.      Observers didn’t have to wait long.      Six days later MicroStrategy poured all $250 million of its inflation-hedging surplus into bitcoin. Gone was the 12-month timeline and the promise to diversify across gold and other alternative assets. All bitcoin, all the time.      Come September, its board of directors had recognized bitcoin as MicroStrategy’s primary treasury reserve and hinted in an SEC filing that more buying could be on the way.      Read more: MicroStrategy Tells SEC It ‘May Increase’ $250M Bitcoin Reserves      It shattered the self-imposed $250 million bitcoin ceiling mere hours later.      As of press time, MicroStrategy has converted $425 million into bitcoin. The stock has surged 30% since its first bitcoin buy on Aug. 11. It was up 9% on Tuesday.      Other publicly traded tech firms – think Apple and Google – park billions of excess capital in cash and leave it there for years. But Saylor didn’t want to leave MicroStrategy’s millions in a bank account where the specter of inflation could slowly whittle it away.      “We just had the awful realization that we were sitting on top of a $500 million ice cube that’s melting,” Saylor said. MicroStrategy has settled on bitcoin as the treasury alternative.      “This is not a speculation, nor is it a hedge,” said Saylor. “This was a deliberate corporate strategy to adopt a bitcoin standard.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/15/bitcoin-ceo-microstrategys-michael-saylor-explains-his-425m-bet-on-btc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a6940074ec7f3efee4afb73bdabdca1cfde05f4a-2164x1542.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411656,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glTNPF,1600188372,"How Crypto Can Win Over Washington, DC","Our industry seeks to revolutionize many of the most important and regulated functions of our society. Due to that ambition, no other industry of comparable size and age has so quickly captured the focus of policymakers and regulators.      This attention creates unique challenges and opportunities. Policies enacted in the coming years related to securities laws, anti-money laundering and know-your-customer requirements, market integrity and taxes could smother our nascent industry, or they could lay the foundation for a flourishing and vibrant cryptocurrency and blockchain economy.    Kristin Smith is the executive director of the Blockchain Association, which celebrates its two- year anniversary this week.    For example, the Financial Action Task Force, an international financial surveillance standards-setting body, has signaled that some of its members may be seeking to restrict peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions and the use of un-hosted wallets. Eliminating or restricting individuals’ ability to transact directly with one another would undermine the fundamental innovation of cryptocurrencies and turn them, in essence, into yet another speculative asset class.      On the other hand, legislation in the U.S. Congress such as the bipartisan Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act, which would exempt from an individual’s taxable income any gain resulting from a personal transaction using virtual currencies so long as the gain is less than $200, would remove a significant barrier to the wider adoption of cryptocurrencies.      Our team at The Blockchain Association works to ensure that lawmakers and regulators see the industry for what it truly is: the future. And since we founded two years ago, there have been a number of positive regulatory developments for our industry.      They include the bipartisan Token Taxonomy Act, which would exempt certain digital tokens from U.S. securities laws; Securities and Exchange Commissioner Hester Peirce’s Safe Harbor proposal would exclude certain tokens from the definition of a security under U.S. law for three years; and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) recent interpretive letter, which opens the way for national banks to provide custody services for cryptographic assets and eliminates ambiguity inhibiting broader institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based services.      However, these bright spots should not obscure the seriousness of several big challenges looming on the horizon. How do we secure the progress already made and combat threats to the potential of the industry?    The public policies that we need for crypto to thrive cannot be achieved if our industry is unwilling to unite and work with the government.    Some in the crypto world, based on a general aversion to anything centralized, view engagement with regulatory agencies and members of Congress as anathema to the spirit of permissionless networks. This approach is a losing one. The public policies that we need for crypto to thrive cannot be achieved if our industry is unwilling to unite and work with the government. If men were angels, government regulation would be unnecessary.      More established industries have long recognized that working together in Washington, even with their most vicious competitors, is an essential component of their success. Do Coke and Pepsi like collaborating in D.C.? They do work together, and not because the sugar has gone to their heads, but because they are more likely to get what they want from the government by combining their powers. Other industries, like Big Tech, have learned the hard way that robust engagement with national regulators is necessary to maintain and grow their market positions.      For crypto to reach its true potential, we likewise must win looming policy debates in Washington by expanding our base of support and being better prepared for an ever-changing political environment. To put it bluntly, there are many who see anything to do with cryptocurrency as a scam, a tool for terrorists, or most mildly: an unsound investment. This sentiment is embodied by Rep. Brad Sherman’s diatribes against crypto. In 2019, he called for an outright ban of cryptocurrencies, noting: “It is the announced purpose of the supporters of cryptocurrencies to take th[e] power [of the U.S. dollar] away from [the United States].      On the other side of the debate, the U.S. crypto and blockchain industry does have a growing stable of champions. Reps. Tom Emmer, Darren Soto, Warren Davidson, and David Schweikert are only a few of many elected congressional representatives who have recognized the potential of cryptocurrencies to transform our financial system for the better. Regulators including Brian Brooks at the OCC and the SEC’s Peirce don’t need to be convinced that crypto has a role to play in our economy.      See also: Hester Peirce - Tell Me How to Improve My Safe Harbor Proposal      To maintain and grow that base of support, the responsible and compliant leaders of our (relatively tiny) industry must set aside old rivalries and speak with one united, forceful voice. There are some that point to crypto’s decentralized design as a reason to think it is essentially impervious to regulation. This is not true, and plays directly into the perspective of congressional members like Sherman. By working together and cultivating more champions, crypto can win over Washington.      The next few years will be pivotal. This is not the time to narrow our view to issues that matter only within our wonderful, rowdy bubble of an industry. Nor is it the time to go at it alone and put rivalry over policy objectives. Members of Congress and key regulators have a lot on their plates. The only way to get their sustained, engaged attention is to speak with a voice loud enough that they can’t ignore what’s being said.      Let’s learn from the success of other industries in shaping positive policy outcomes and not be left sitting quietly on the sidelines in the fight for the future of our industry.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Kristin Smith,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/09/15/how-crypto-can-win-over-washington-dc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/74b0e13ff44fcffd3c522a12399b0fdbd7135f52-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Top shelf    Bitcoin buy MicroStrategy, a business intelligence company, told the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday it ""may increase"" its BTC holdings beyond the $250 million haul purchased in August. The morning after: it did. Microstrategy has acquired an additional $175 million worth of BTC in a single purchase. These blockbuster buys transformed much of MicroStrategy's cash reserves into bitcoin, placing the Nasdaq-traded firm among Wall Street's most notable bitcoin bulls. Future allocations would continue down the treasury allocation path. On Sept. 11, the board formally recognized bitcoin as MicroStrategy's ""primary treasury reserve asset on an ongoing basis.""      Binance abets? Binance has been accused of “aiding and abetting” the theft of $60 million in cryptocurrency in 2018. Crypto exchange Zaif, now called Fisco, has said hackers transferred 1,451 bitcoin (~$9.4 million at the time) to an address belonging to Binance and used the exchange’s minimal know-your-customer and trading procedures to launder the money. The exchange is now seeking repayment for the allegedly laundered funds and other damages. Interestingly, Fisco is bringing the case in a California district court in part because “critical components'' of Binance’s business, such as its AWS servers, are located in the U.S. state.      Power struggle Has Bitmain’s power struggle come to an end? An updated Chinese business registration record shows co-founder Jihan Wu is once again legal representative and executive director of the bitcoin (BTC) miner maker giant, replacing rival co-founder Micree Zhan. CoinDesk’s Wolfie Zhou has reported Zhan was ousted from the company last October but regained control earlier this year. He remains a general manager of the firm, according to the business record. “Since 2020, the management’s feud has damaged Bitmain’s market shares and its brand image. We have lost customers and employees were forced to take sides,” Bitmain said in a post. While it seems things are settling down, the two co-founders are still engaged in a legal battle in the Cayman Island courts.      Goodbye market ""Increasingly strict"" regulations are to blame of Paxful’s decision to pull out of the Venezeulan crypto market, according to a video tweeted Monday. The P2P exchange has suspended account creation and has said existing users will have 30 days to withdraw their funds. Paxful was Venezuela’s second-largest P2P outlet, CoinDesk’ Danny Nelson reports, adding the nation’s crypto traders heavily favor P2P crypto exchanges like market leader LocalBitcoins over government-approved alternatives. Rampant inflation, unbanked population and high mobile phone usage have long appealed to the company, CEO Ray Youssef said, but ultimately local regulations and U.S. sanctions prevailed.      Testy about tether The New York Attorney General’s office is losing patience with Bitfinex and Tether in a long-simmering legal battle. NYAG Senior Enforcement Counsel John Castiglione filed a letter Monday calling for the crypto firms to comply with a 17-month-old document production order detailing financial information within the next two months. The watchdog is looking for communications about Tether’s loans, loans to third parties and a list of U.S. or New York customers who had funds on Crypto Capital, a bank allegedly at the center of the investigation into the loss of $1 billion in customer funds. Defendants responded saying the injunction was overly broad, saying asking for information about all tethers is like “asking GM for all documents about cars.”    Quick bites  Nigeria’s SEC Says All Crypto Assets Are Securities by Default (Paddy Baker/CoinDesk)  Brock Pierce Served Court Papers for Fraud Lawsuit at His Own Presidential Campaign Rally (Sebastian Sinclair/CoinDesk)  Thai Central Bank’s New Blockchain-Enabled Bond Infrastructure Passes Test With $1.6B Bond Sale (Jaspreet Kalra/CoinDesk)  Top Banks Lose $635 Billion in Market Cap During 2020 (Shaurya Malwa/Decrypt)  Measuring Bitcoin’s Decentralization (Coin Metrics)  At stake    File away? Filecoin, the much-anticipated distributed file sharing protocol, is nearing its mainnet launch.      After years of development, funded by a $257 million initial coin offering in 2017, the project that looks to unseat the dominant cloud services business – Amazon, Microsoft and Google – and content delivery networks like Cloudflare is targeting mid-September for launch.      CoinDesk’s Brady Dale reports Filecoin is entering the fray as data hosting costs only continue to drop, potentially endangering the protocol’s business model.      But Juan Benet, Filecoin’s creator, has a longer-term vision for the development of the internet. Specifically, the project is wagering there will be increasing demand for a new type of data storage: redundant, immutable and radically accessible.      “Unlike centralized cloud storage services, which back up data in ways clients can’t change or verify, Filecoin allows clients to easily express their own preferences for reliability and cost,” a new document released ahead of the network launch, “Engineering Filecoin’s Economy,” explains.      Dale breaks down the economic mechanics that might make Filecoin a real competitor. This includes paying rewards for miners that secure the network and host the distributed data, ensuring that everything on the network has an upfront cost and treating all data as unique bits (known as content addressing).      “Mining on Filecoin is largely about providing storage space using traditional storage systems. This is commodity hardware. Almost anyone with an internet connection can participate,” Dale writes.      While Filecoin has been beset by delays in the past, a growing enthusiasm in China and the success of its testnet may point to a successful launch.    Market intel    Cautiously bullish Bitcoin (BTC) has crossed into bullish territory, but prices remain vulnerable to a potential sell-off in stocks, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports. The leading cryptocurrency jumped above $10,700 on Monday, confirming an upside break of 10-day-long price consolidation. While the breakout has exposed resistances at $11,000–$11,200, Matthew Dibb, co-founder and COO of Stack Funds, said it's too early to call an end of the price pullback from August highs above $12,400. ""Previous sell-offs have been exacerbated by risk-off momentum in stocks, particularly the tech-heavy Nasdaq index,"" Dibb told CoinDesk. ""We remain cautiously bullish this week.""      DeFi index Data company DeFi Pulse and investment-minded Set Protocol have created a permissionless index of top performing DeFi tokens, called the DeFiPulse Index. The weighted index, similar to the S&P 500, offers exposure to the booming DeFi field through one token, called DPI, which will track LEND, YFI, COMP, SNX, MKR, REN, KNC, LRC, BAL and REP. That order is arranged from the largest portion of the index (LEND at 18.3%) to the smallest (REP at 1.63%). The token is available on Uniswap, Set’s TokenSets, Zapper, Argent, Dharma and others.    Tech pod    Bitcoin smart contracts A new Bitcoin smart contract-enabling protocol developed by the Lightning Network Protocol and Bitcoin Protocol (LNP/BP) Standards Association is now in beta. Called RGB, the network could be used to issue tokenize securities and nonfungible tokens (NFT), and to offer a more private means of stablecoin issuance and transfer on the most popular blockchain. One of its architects, Giacomo Zucco, said it could also help outfit Bitcoin with the tokenizing capabilities that have made Ethereum the go-to blockchain for issuing tokenized assets like securities, collectibles, crypto dollars and more.    Op-ed    Oracles and enterprise Paul Brody, a Principal and Global Blockchain Leader at EY, thinks oracles can become a real part of the traditional business practices, but enterprises need third-party – read: auditors – access first. “Oracles are of immense importance to the future of blockchain commerce ecosystems. We cannot develop large-scale commerce without trusted inputs. We will need, however, to accommodate multiple approaches to certifying information, including ones that lean on off-chain judgement and verification, not just clever algorithms,” he writes.

The firms announced Tuesday the move allowed Dapper Labs to add fiat payment options to its website for the first time. The startup's current flagship offering, NBA Top Shot, launched in June and has clocked $2 million in revenue and 58,081 transactions, according to data shared with CoinDesk.      The game relies on NFTs, a special type of cryptocurrency where every single token is unique and individual, making them ideal for collectible cards or digital art. The embrace of USDC on Dapper's back-end is another bid by the firm to court mainstream users by reducing the friction associated with cryptocurrency payments.      Dapper Labs, which was behind the popular CryptoKitties game that choked the Ethereum blockchain in 2017, said supporting fiat currencies lets the company appeal to the broader collectibles market. Ethereum's scaling issues drove Dapper Labs to launch its own Flow blockchain earlier this year.

42405052,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKmtn,1600184480,Eastern Europe Actively Using Crypto for Illicit Purposes: Chainalysis,"A significant amount of cryptocurrencies passes through dark web marketplaces in Eastern Europe, according to Chainalysis.    Eastern Europe is actively using crypto for illicit purposes, the blockchain analytics firm said in a recent report. Out of $41 billion in total transaction volume, 1.4% was sent to various ""illicit entities,"" the second-highest share in the world after Latin America.  ""In fact, Eastern Europe accounts for more global darknet market activity than any other region,"" Chainalysis said in its report, ""Eastern Europe: High Grassroots Adoption, Outsized Darknet Market and Ransomware Activity.""  Most of that activity occurs on the Hydra Marketplace, which, by Chainalysis' estimate, is the sixth-largest service by cryptocurrency volume in the region – ""no other region has a darknet market or other illicit service in its top ten services,"" the firm said in a blog post.  Hydra is a popular drug-selling marketplace that also provides other kinds of illicit goods and services such as fake IDs. Hydra famously announced an initial coin offering (ICO) in December 2019. In June, the ICO was postponed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Eastern Europe also leads the world in ransomware, Chainalysis said. More than 23% of funds received from ransomware addresses were linked to the region. The possible reason, according to the report, is the combination of lower economic opportunities, government sponsorship of hacking activities and high tech literacy among the youth.  Eastern Europe include two countries that lead the world in crypto adoption: Ukraine and Russia, as CoinDesk previously reported. Although these countries don't show the largest crypto trading volumes, the population there is actively using crypto and trading it peer-to-peer, Chainalysis said.  Read more: Ukraine Leads Global Crypto Adoption, Chainalysis Says in New Report   For example, user base of the p2p exchange Paxful reported its user base in Russia has grown 350% during the COVID-19 pandemic.  During the past year, Russia has sent over $16.8 billion worth of cryptocurrency and received $16.6 billion while Ukraine has sent $8.2 billion and received $8 billion, Chainalysis estimated. This is much lower than China, the U.S. and some other countries show. However, relative to those countries' economies and internet users numbers, these crypto volumes are significant, according to Chainalysis.  Roughly 85% of all transaction volume in the region during the past year were ""professional-sized transfers of over $10,000 worth of cryptocurrency,"" Chainalysis said. This, again, is significantly less than in North America and northern and western Europe. However, there are large crypto investment enterprises in Eastern Europe, and Chainalysis names ITI Funds, one of the participants in Telegram's TON token sale in 2018.

42405055,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKmvl,1600178449,"Galaxy Digital, IOSG Lead $1.2M Raise for Startup Creating Automated Ethereum Services","A Berlin-based startup creating a tech stack for automated Ethereum services, has raised $1.2 million in a seed round led by Polkadot backer IOSG Ventures and crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital.    Gelato Network announced Tuesday the funding would go towards developing its network infrastructure as well as launching an decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that will one day take over governance.  Founded late last year, Gelato is building a product that adds the next stage to smart contracts, allowing Ethereum developers to automate contract execution on their dapps.  While smart contracts execute functions once pre-defined conditions are met, most still require users to manually send the transaction itself.  That can either introduce bottlenecks into the system if the user isn't online, or additional risk if a third party has to be trusted to execute the transaction when required.  Having moved to a live mainnet offering in June, Gelato offers developers programmable bots – software that performs automated tasks online – that can be customized to execute specific transactions for selected smart contracts.  While automated smart contract execution is already available, Gelato says this will be the first such product built entirely on a completely decentralized infrastructure.  That means bots aren't programmed by just one team of developers and are, therefore, less at risk to a single point of failure.  One use case for Gelato could be automating repayments on DeFi lending platforms, which makes the loan process seamless and faster, saving borrowers from paying unnecessary interest when they're not online.  Seed round co-leader IOSG Ventures has invested in many of the industry's household names, such as Vechain, Dfinity, Lisk, Cosmos and Polkadot.  Meanwhile, Galaxy Digital was a major stakeholder in alternative blockchain platform EOS – which it moved out of last year.  The seed round also included commits from Gnosis; two venture DAOs, MetaCartel Ventures and The LAO; and Christoph Jentzsch, who was part of the team that created the original Ethereum DAO back in 2015.  Part of the role of the seed investors is to help with the long-term sustainability of the Gelato DAO, which will ultimately allow Ethereum projects to coordinate and identify what services and functions should be automated.  The DAO is scheduled to launch sometime in Q1 2021, Gelato ""Legendary Member"" Hilmar Orth told CoinDesk.  It's unclear when Gelato anticipates launching its DAO. CoinDesk reached out to the team for comment but hadn't received a response by press time.  In a statement, IOSG founding partner Jocy Lin said Gelato was, among other things, providing some of the ""critical infrastructure"" for the still-nascent DeFi space.

The Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS), a coordinating body for state regulators, confirmed to Reuters the new regime for money service businesses (MSB) will introduce the same rules and standards across 48 states.  This will streamline compliance, making it easy for state-licensed money transmitters like Coinbase to work across multiple states, instead of going through the time and expense of getting regulated in each and every one.  One state will lead a group in representing all 49 regulatory bodies in evaluating each different company, and this model will apply to 78 MSBs, including Western Union and PayPal, that together move a reported $1 trillion annually.  Speaking to Reuters, John Ryan, CSBS’ president and CEO, said the framework will be just as robust, but much more efficient, at enforcing state regulation.

42405061,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKn2e,1600175010,India Said to Be Preparing to Ban Cryptocurrency Trading: Bloomberg,"India is reportedly moving to ban the trading of cryptocurrencies.    The federal cabinet is expected to soon discuss a new bill before passing it to the parliament, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.  While the government is exploring the possible uses of blockchains to manage land records, pharmaceutical drugs supply chain or records of educational certificates, it is against cryptocurrency trading, according to the two sources.  The Reserve Bank of India had banned commercial banks from servicing to crypto traders and exchanges in 2018.  The nation's supreme court overruled the central bank's ban in March.  Since then, trading volumes on cryptocurrency exchanges servicing Indian clients have picked up sharply.  A private think tank recently said the Indian government should regulate bitcoin like a corporate stock.

42405068,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKn8Y,1600174580,"First Mover: Bitcoin Investors the Sane Ones as Federal Reserve Cheers Inflation, Price Nears $11K","One of the interesting things about cryptocurrency investors is they really do look at the world very differently from many of their counterparts in traditional finance.      The thinking goes something like this: The efforts of governments and central banks to repair the economy are doomed to fail, and likely to make the situation worse. There is no point in moving to a defensive investment strategy because prices for digital assets are going to the moon. Every time the stock market goes up, it just validates the reality that the dollar is being debased by trillions of dollars of central bank money printing.      The latest turn-logic-on-its-head zinger came Monday from Dan Morehead, a former Wall Street trader and hedge fund executive who now heads the cryptocurrency-focused investment firm Pantera Capital in the San Francisco area.      In a monthly letter, Morehead was discussing how central banks typically succeed when they pointedly attempt to increase inflation, as the Federal Reserve is now pursuing as an official policy. He cited Venezuela and Zimbabwe as two prior success stories, as it were.      Morehead then pivoted to the argument that asset prices ""are not rising because stock fundamentals have improved,"" but because ""a huge wave of money is being printed.""      ""Gold is at a 5,000-year high,"" Morehead wrote. ""Or, said another way, paper money is at an all-time low.""      It's that counterintuitive, ""put another way"" perspective that can sometimes seem refreshing, partly because the crypto investor keeps getting proven right. Audiences on both Wall Street and in broader society are now becoming more receptive to the idea that the traditional financial system and economy are both unsustainable and unfair.      The Federal Reserve's top monetary officials meet this week to discuss their next steps for healing the U.S. economy, which at this point appears to consist of doing nothing for the next several years until inflation rises above the central bank's historic 2% target and stays above that level for a while.      As reported by First Mover Monday, it's possible the Fed's next move would come if the stock market takes a fresh dive, prompting the central bank to step in and pump more money into the economy to keep markets functioning smoothly.      Jeff Dorman, another former Wall Street veteran who's now chief investment officer of the cryptocurrency-focused investment Arca Funds in Los Angeles, wrote Monday in his weekly column that Congress, which has been gridlocked over a new coronavirus-related stimulus package, might also be prone to a similar do-nothing-until-you-have-to dynamic.      He has written in the past that ""it would likely take an equity temper tantrum before Congress acts,"" and he wrote this week, ""Methinks Congress will be acting soon.""      ""Moral hazard never left, but it's definitely back,"" according to Dorman.      What tips the scales toward the crypto investors being the sane ones and not the other way around is that market signals are currently validating the crypto investment thesis.      Bill Gross, the legendary former Pimco bond fund manager, is encouraging investors to get defensive because ""there is little money to be made almost anywhere in the world,"" CNBC reported Monday.      Tell that to Morehead of Pantera, whose Digital Asset Fund has returned 168% so far this year, according to the letter.      Morehead said bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are winning because they have a relatively fixed supply, similar to gold, and ""improved usage/fundamentals,"" similar to tech stocks like Amazon and Netflix.      Just compare the following chart of year-to-date asset-class performance from Pantera:      To this one from Goldman Sachs (off by a few days so the percentages are a touch different):      One includes crypto, and goes up to 244%; the other doesn't include crypto, and it goes up to 29%. So far this year, based on the track record so far anyway, it turns out the smart money was in crypto.    Bitcoin Watch    Bitcoin looks north, having breached a 10-day-long sideways trend with a move above $10,500 on Monday.      Bullish developments on key technical indicators back the range breakout. For instance, the 14-day relative strength index has violated a descending trendline, signaling an end of the price pullback from the August high of $12,476.      Further, the MACD histogram, an indicator used to gauge trend strength and trend changes, has crossed above zero, indicating a bullish reversal.      As such, resistance levels at $11,000 and $11,200 could soon come into play. That said, the cryptocurrency remains vulnerable to a potential sell-off in equity markets, according to analysts.      ""Previous sell-offs have been exacerbated by risk-off momentum in stocks, particularly the tech-heavy Nasdaq index,"" Matthew Dibb, co-founder and COO of Stack Fund, told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat.

42405064,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeKn5b,1600169066,Analyst 'Cautiously Bullish' on Bitcoin but Says Equity Sell-Off Still a Threat,"Bitcoin (BTC) has crossed into bullish territory, but prices remain vulnerable to a potential sell-off in stocks, an analyst believes.    The leading cryptocurrency jumped above $10,700 on Monday, confirming an upside break of 10-day-long price consolidation.  While the breakout has exposed resistances at $11,00–$11,200, Matthew Dibb, co-founder and COO of Stack Funds, said it's too early to call an end of the price pullback from August highs above $12,400.  ""Previous sell-offs have been exacerbated by risk-off momentum in stocks, particularly the tech-heavy Nasdaq index,"" Dibb told CoinDesk. ""We remain cautiously bullish this week.""  Bitcoin's decline from $12,000 to $10,000 seen in the first week of September was also accompanied by a 10% drop in U.S. tech stocks.  Analysts at investment banking giant Goldman Sachs say the U.S. stock market sell-off is nearing an end.  However, Joel Kruger, a strategist at LMAX Exchange, believes stocks are going to have a hard time rallying, leaving the door open for a bitcoin price pullback to the $6,000–$8,000 range.  ""Bitcoin needs to clear the 2019 high of $13,800 to force me to rethink my bearish bias,"" Kruger told CoinDesk.  Meanwhile, Stack's Dibb is also keeping an eye on the action in the foreign exchange markets.  ""We are paying close attention to the USD trade flow and any further rotation to reserve currencies [like the U.S. dollar] that may signal macro hedging,"" he said.  The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, has come under pressure this week, propelling hard assets like bitcoin and gold higher.  Bitcoin has developed a relatively strong negative correlation with the dollar index this quarter.  The cryptocurrency is currently trading near $10,870 at press time, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  From a technical analysis standpoint, the immediate bias will remain bullish as long as prices hold above $10,500.  However, $11,200, which acted as strong support in August, may now prove a tough nut to crack, according to Patrick Heusser, a senior cryptocurrency trader at Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG.

In a statement signed Friday, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of Africa's most populous country said all crypto assets will fall under the regulation that covers securities exchanges and transactions on exchanges.  It added that the burden of proof will be on issuers themselves to show the regulator, in an initial assessment filing, how their particular digital asset doesn't count as a security.  ""The position of the Commission is that virtual crypto assets are securities unless proven otherwise,"" the SEC said.  The SEC confirmed all forms of digital asset offering taking place in the country, as well as participating individuals and companies, acting for themselves or on behalf of others, will be subject to its regulatory guidelines and approval.  As well as clarifying in no uncertain terms whose jurisdiction cryptocurrencies fall into, the move might also cover all bases and ensure even offerings that don't meet the criteria as a securities sale still register and file with the SEC.  It may also be an attempt to better control overseas offerings. Issuers that are based in countries without reciprocal investment agreements with Nigeria, such as the U.S., could be compelled to set up a local branch in the country.  Nigeria isn't the first African nation aligning digital asset offerings with existing securities guidance. South Africa published a policy paper in April that called for all token offerings to adhere to traditional regulation as much as possible.

Video footage posted to Twitter on Tuesday shows Pierce receiving what appear to be court documents resulting from a class-action lawsuit brought against the founders and former executives of blockchain developer Block.one.  Lawyer James Koutoulas, who tweeted the video, said his team had served Pierce for his alleged involvement in the EOS token sale, which raised $4.1 billion between June 2017 and June 2018.  ""When you’re trying to avoid getting served for a multi B fraud case, maybe lay off outlandish presidential campaigns,"" Koutoulas wrote.  Lead plaintiff Crypto Assets Opportunity Fund is accusing Block.one, CEO Brendan Blumer, CTO Dan Larimer, former CSO Brock Pierce and former partner Ian Grigg of deceiving investors over the token sale and are seeking damages.  Block.one is a private blockchain company that began in 2017 and is best known for developing the EOS.IO protocol – for which the EOS token is the native cryptocurrency.  In September 2019, Block.one reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and agreed to pay $24 million in damages for running an unregistered securities sale in exchange for waiving legal restrictions.  However, Jenny Vatrenko, legal director at Haven Network, replied to comments on Twitter, saying: ""Fortunately for the investors who lost money, they have a private cause of action against Block.one that's not precluded by the SEC's settlement.""  Pierce announced his presidential bid back in July, but missed filing deadlines in several states to place his name on the ballot.  Pierce has also co-founded other crypto projects including stablecoin tether (originally called Realcoin) and Blockchain Capital, a venture capital firm.

42432656,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0fhh,1600156505,Japanese Crypto Exchange Accuses Binance of Helping Launder $9M From 2018 Hack,"A Japanese cryptocurrency exchange that suffered from a $60 million hack in 2018 is suing Binance for ""aiding and abetting"" the laundering of some of the stolen funds.      According to a complaint filed by Fisco in the Northern California District Court on Sept. 14, the Japanese exchange alleged that soon after it lost nearly 6,000 bitcoin in the 2018 hack, the thieves sent 1,451 bitcoin to an address belonging to Binance, which was worth $9.4 million at the time.      Fisco – called Zaif at the time of the hack – added that the thieves subsequently laundered the funds on the world's largest exchange platform, due to its allegedly lax know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) protocols that ""do not measure up to industry standards.""      The thieves are claimed to have taken advantage of Binance's policy that allowed new users to open accounts and transact on the platform in amounts fewer than two bitcoins without needing to provide any meaningful identifying information.      ""The thieves broke the stolen bitcoin into seven thousands of separate transactions and accounts, all valued below the 2-bitcoin threshold. In this way, the thieves converted the stolen bitcoin into other cryptocurrencies and transmitted the value from the Binance platform,"" the plaintiff said.      Fisco alleged that since Binance was notified and had ""actual knowledge"" the stolen funds were sent to its platform, it ""either intentionally or negligently failed to interrupt the money laundering process when it could have done so.""      As such, Fisco is demanding Binance to pay for its loss of the laundered funds in addition to other punitive damages.      Zaif was sold by its then-parent entity Tech Bureau to Fisco shortly after the incident, which compensated users' who had lost funds in the hack.      About $41 million worth of crypto assets from the hack belonged to Zaif customers including those based within the U.S. and California, according to the court filing.      Biannce has not yet responded to CoinDesk's request for comment.      The case has the potential to draw further attention to cryptocurrency exchanges' KYC and AML procedures, as the Financial Action Task Force is working towards bringing global regulators in line with its 2019 anti-money laundering guidance on ""virtual asset service providers,"" known as the Travel Rule.      Also read: FATF Compliance Effort Adds Huobi, Bitfinex and Tether to Governance Task Force    California claims    Fisco also argued the case should be brought to trial in the California court not only because there were victims who were based in the region, but also ""critical components"" of Binance's business are located in the U.S. state.      For example, Fisco said Binance uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host its servers and has the ability to select whichever AWS data center it chooses for its operations.      The argument comes after repeated statements made by Binance that it has no traditional physical headquarters anywhere in the world.      ""Upon information and belief, a significant portion if not all of the AWS servers Binance relies on for its operations are located in the State of California. Upon information and belief, the AWS Region and AWS Availability Zones housing Binance’s digital data used to run its technical platform are located in California,"" Fisco said.      In addition to Binance having hired half a dozen employees in California, Fisco argued that a significant portion of Binance's cryptocurrency reserves is also stored in offline hardware facilities located in the San Francisco Bay Area that are controlled and managed by custodians headquartered in the region.      ""For example, on July 7, 2020, Binance acquired cryptocurrency startup Swipe. Binance admits that Swipe uses Coinbase and Bitgo, both of which are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, to custody the cryptocurrency used in Swipe’s business,"" the plaintiff said.      Fisco is seeking a jury trial over its allegations.

42432654,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0ffh,1600140000,Jihan Wu Regains Upper Hand in Bitmain Co-Founder Fight,"In a new twist in Bitmain's ongoing power struggle, co-founder Jihan Wu has regained the legal representative status of the bitcoin miner maker giant.      China's business registration record update on Sept. 14 shows Wu has again become the legal representative and executive director of Beijing Bitmain Technology, the operating entity of Bitmain.      Subsequently, Micree Zhan, the rival co-founder who was ousted last October by Wu but regained control earlier this year, is no longer the legal representative and executive director but remains a general manager of the firm.      The role of a company's legal representative in China has broad powers to act on a firm's behalf and usually also holds the company's official seal, a crucial element for signing company decisions into effect.      In an announcement published Sept. 15 via the WeChat account of Bitmain's AntMiner brand, Wu reaffirmed the status update and said the company's respect for Zhan ""remains unchanged.""    Battle for Bitmain    The update suggests Bitmain's internal power fight may have come to a short-term end although the two sides' lawsuit in the Cayman Islands – where Bitmain's parent holding entity resides – is pending for a final judgment.      Wu added in the announcement that Bitmain's management now aims to work out sustainable solutions to solve all kinds of problems caused for employees, investors and customers due to the co-founders' war of words.      ""Since 2020, the management's feud has damaged Bitmain's market shares and its brand image. We have lost customers and employees were forced to take sides,"" Bitmain said in the post. ""Various breaking events and negative news even thwarted our plan to go public. Our equity option promised to employees almost became a useless piece of paper.""      Read more: Leaked Transcript Details Power Struggle Inside Bitcoin Mining Giant Bitmain      In an October coup last year, Wu removed Zhan's role as Bitmain's chairman, executive director and legal representative even though Zhan is the biggest shareholder of Bitmain. Wu alleged that Zhan's leadership during 2019 caused serious issues – including a significant drop in Bitmain's bitcoin miner market share. Zhan filed a lawsuit in the Cayman Islands in December over the legitimacy of Wu's move.      The event has quickly escalated to a yearlong power struggle.

42432667,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0fzh,1600132537,New York Attorney General to Bitfinex and Tether: ‘Delays Must Stop’,"The New York Attorney General’s office is losing patience with Bitfinex and Tether.      NYAG Senior Enforcement Counsel John Castiglione filed a letter Monday ahead of a conference involving the regulator and the two cryptocurrency firms arguing it is time they complied with a 17-month-old document production order detailing financial information within the next two months.      For their part, counsel representing the two firms argue the order is too broad and the scope should be limited first.      “As of this filing, the 354 Order has been in place for seventeen months. In that time, Respondents have produced ‘jurisdictional’ documents (as directed by this Court) but failed to produce the core information called for in the Order. The delays must stop, and Respondents should be directed to comply promptly,” Castiglione said.      New York State Supreme Court Justice Joel M. Cohen scheduled the hearing for this Thursday, after receiving a request from the New York Attorney General’s (NYAG) office last week complaining that Bitfinex and Tether had yet to turn over any documents.      According to Castiglione, the NYAG is requesting all documents be submitted within 60 days and an injunction preventing Tether from loaning funds to Bitfinex be extended a further 90 days. Charles Michael, an attorney with Steptoe and Johnson LLP representing Bitfinex, opposed any extension of the injunction in his own letter.      “The allegedly concealed facts have been out in the open for 17 months, during which consumers have been free to redeem their tethers without restriction,” he wrote. “Instead, they have chosen to buy, with tethers’ market cap growing six-fold (to over $14 billion).”      In his view, the fact that Tether’s market cap has increased this dramatically indicates market confidence in the dollar-pegged cryptocurrency, and negates the justification for the injunction.      ""Consumers are well protected today, and do not need [the Attorney General's] injunction. The loan transaction supposedly impairing tether’s reserves was over 25% of tether's backing at the time of the injunction, but, thanks to Bitfinex’s repayments and tether's growth, the balance now is less than 4% of tether's backing,” Michael wrote.      He added that tether’s assets exceed the amount of USDT issued by $160 million.    17 months    It has indeed been a long journey. The case began in April 2019, when the Attorney General’s office said Bitfinex had lost access to close to $1 billion in customer funds, and borrowed from Tether’s reserves. The stablecoin issuer shares corporate owners and executives with Bitfinex, though in various legal filings counsel for the companies said the loan and a subsequent line of credit were negotiated independently of each other.      The NYAG won an injunction preventing Tether from sending any more funds to Bitfinex, and Cohen ordered the firms to share all documentation about the deals, as well as documents about tether issuances, among other concerns.      Bitfinex and Tether appealed the ruling, but lost the appeal in July. Earlier this month, the NYAG’s office asked to schedule Thursday’s conference to request a new production order with a strict timeline.      Monday’s letter provided more information. The NYAG wants Bitfinex and Tether to produce purchase information for tether, U.S. dollar withdrawal requests, tax documents and account information within one week.      Read more: NY AG Asks Court for New Order to Make Bitfinex Turn Over Tether Loan Documents      Within a month, the NYAG wants communications about Tether’s loans, loans to third parties and a list of U.S. or New York customers who had funds on Crypto Capital, and within 60 days it wants “full production” of information related to a November 2018 subpoena, a February 2019 letter and jurisdictional documents.      The original production order from 2019 called for the materials to be ready within a month, Castiglione said.      “Most of the materials called for are core business documents that should exist and be readily accessible: order and trade information, client lists, lists of bank accounts and their balances, tax returns, and other similar material,” the letter said, adding that, “the 354 Order is well over a year old and the appeal was decided two months ago.”      Michael wrote that some of the requests would require Bitfinex or Tether to “generate reports, accountings or answer questions” that do not currently exist.    ‘Extensive ties’    The NYAG also preemptively stated its opposition to any narrowing of the judge’s order, noting that “respondents have stated they will move this court” to do so. According to Castiglione, the court’s role in the case is limited beyond the orders already signed, and the production demand is well within the NYAG’s authority under the Martin Act, the law it’s using to conduct its inquiry into Bitfinex.      Michael’s opposition letter wrote that the court could limit the scope to avoid unduly burdening the respondents, in this case Bitfinex and Tether. The court itself has already said that any “unreasonable or not terribly relevant” requests can be opposed.      Bitfinex is arguing that a request for all documents about all tether transactions is overbroad. Michael likened it to “asking GM for all documents about cars.” The NYAG is also looking for documents outside its jurisdiction, he claimed.      In his brief, Michael wrote that the proposed timeline should be denied. Instead, he proposed a 30-day period for the two parties to discuss the scope of the request, saying Bitfinex and Tether would produce documents “not subject to dispute” in the meantime.      Read more: Tether, Bitfinex File Motion to Dismiss Market Manipulation Lawsuit      He seemingly pushed back against the NYAG’s claims that insufficient documents have been produced, writing that the crypto firms have produced more than 70,000 documents so far.      “Bitfinex and Tether also voluntarily produced extensive information to OAG, even while the First Department stay was in effect, including via two multihour presentations and a series of other communications aimed at answering directly the questions OAG indicated it was most interested in having answered,” Michael wrote.      He also noted that Bitfinex and Tether announced a ban on all New York customers nearly three years ago.      Castiglione, in contrast, wrote that an investigation into Tether and tether is proper, “given their [respondents] extensive ties to the state.”      In his view, the appeals court’s ruling in the NYAG’s favor suggested the regulator could find additional information that would reveal further violations of the law.",NEGATIVE,USDT,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/15/new-york-attorney-general-to-bitfinex-and-tether-delays-must-stop,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f11975329dd01123cc1f9509e592571e6e20430b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
