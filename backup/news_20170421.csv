42427488,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVidh,1492809395,Watch This Ethereum Slot Machine Make Payouts in Real Time,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4I93e7KUMg  A new startup called Better Gaming is hoping to tap into the billion-dollar online gambling industry by tapping the power of ethereum smart contracts.  The company, which is based in Malta and London and has been operating in stealth mode up until now, has released a demo video of its first product: a slot machine game that runs in-browser as an ethereum DApp, issuing payouts to users based on the terms of its associated smart contract.  In the Medium post introducing the product, developer Jez San writes that the team decided on a slot machine game for two reasons. First, because the level of mathematical complexity would provide a good benchmark for what was possible in a game-focused smart contract, and secondly, because slot machines are the most popular form of entertainment in Western casinos.  (In fact, slot machines are credited for perfecting the addictive mode of user interactions which many modern games and applications try to replicate.)  The demo video is recorded with Chrome running the Metamask browser plugin, though any compatible ethereum browser would work, including the Status mobile browser according to San's post – a factor that could bring smart contract gaming to the lucrative mobile market.  A release date for the playable version hasn't yet been confirmed, but with the gameplay capturing all the gaudy sounds and colours of the real-world slots, there's sure to be no shortage of gamblers chancing their ether on a winning line.

42427478,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKViPh,1492789434,European Commission Backs Blockchain Pilot With €500k Budget,"The European Union’s executive branch is establishing an ""observatory"" focused on blockchain as part of a wider pilot project.  Unveiled earlier this week, the initiative, according to the European Commission, seeks to to ""gather opinions and to voice concerns around Blockchain and DLT"". The Commission plans to solicit proposals from possible partners during the second quarter of this year.  Late last month, the Commission revealed that it would seek to improve its institutional knowledge through the pilot, operating in tandem with a task force created by the European Parliament last year.  The announcement includes some new details about the pilot, including its two-year duration and its €500k budget. And while the scope of the project centers primarily on education, there do appear to be some practical elements, including a plan to ""build and animate a platform for the European blockchain community"".  Ultimately, the pilot could lead to new policies in the EU centered around blockchain.  As the Commission explained:  ""The purpose will be to inform and assist the European Commission in understanding what role – if any - European public authorities should play to encourage the development and up-take of these technologies and to formulate related policy recommendations.""  Whether any of the tests translate into actual applications of the tech by the Commission remains to be seen.  However, according to the announcement, the body said it wants ""explore possible use cases with a value added at EU level"" – indicating that such approaches are possible.

42427489,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVifh,1492783550,8-Hour Miner Meeting Ends With Litecoin Scaling Agreement,"Litecoin's scaling debate may be coming to an end.  A group of miners and exchanges is throwing support behind a new proposal, an agreement that follows weeks of increasingly acrimonious debate over whether the technical upgrade would be enacted on the litecoin network, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  Backed  also by the cryptocurrency's creator, Coinbase employee Charlie Lee, the statement endorses a ""Segregated Witness soft fork on Litecoin"", which would bring a scaling upgrade first proposed for bitcoin to litecoin, most likely sooner than it could be activated on the bitcoin blockchain.  According to organizer and litecoin community member 'PZ', the meeting was held on WeChat for over eight hours, from 12pm to 8pm Beijing Standard Time today.  Created by bitcoin's development team, the SegWit upgrade has long been lauded for the creative way it seeks to increase transaction capacity without needing to alter hard-coded block size rules. Litecoin, like bitcoin, also has a 1 MB cap on the total capacity of transactions per block, and as such, it faces similar scalability constraints long term.  Overall, the statement endorses a collaborative approach and blasts the use of so-called user-activated soft forks, or UASFs, as viable scaling alternatives.  The post reads:  ""We agree that protocol upgrade should be made under community consensus, and should not be unilateral action of developers nor miners. We advocate that Litecoin protocol upgrade decision should be made based on the needs of the users, through the roundtable meeting voting process, and activated by miner voting.""  Miners backing the proposal include Bitmain (Antpool), BW.com, BATPool, F2Pool and LTC1BTC – a combination that represents roughly 68% of the hashrate. That number rises to approximately 84% if you include LTC.top, which is reportedly controlled by the same owners as LTC1BTC according to the meeting's organizer.  Notable among the participants, however, is Bitmain, which threw its support behind a potential block size increase as well in the future – provided that capacity usage rises over a certain threshold.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu confirmed he was personally in attendance at the meeting, despite his long opposition to the same upgrade on the bitcoin network. He said that it was the combination of SegWit, with a promise to support on-chain scaling solutions, that ultimately led Bitmain to back the proposal.  ""Charlie [Lee] promised to provide solution of increasing the block size when it is half full,"" he said.  Going forward, it's unclear how quickly the capacity upgrade could be enacted on litecoin. Miners will now need to signal for the upgrade by downloading the latest software that includes support for SegWit.  More than 75% will need to signal for the upgrade, and this figure will need to be held for two weeks, according to the original proposal, published with the software in January.  ""When the usage of litecoin block capacity is over 50%, we will start to prepare for a solution to increase the 1 MB block size limit through a hard fork or soft fork,"" the statement reads.  According to organizers, efforts are being made to bring other parties and stakeholders within the group, including exchange services Bitstamp, BTC-e, Bitfinex and Poloniex.

42427496,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVirh,1492781457,"That Time We Gave $500,000 in Bitcoin to College Kids...","Dan Elitzer is the blockchain and digital identity lead at IDEO CoLab (a collaborative R&D network) and the founder of the MIT Bitcoin Club; Jeremy Rubin is a Bitcoin Core developer and the co-founder of the MIT Digital Currency Initiative, the school's in-house research effort aimed at the technology.    In this ""Bitcoin Milestones"" entry, Elitzer and Rubin recall their efforts as MIT students to boost bitcoin, using a mock interview with CoinDesk to tell the story of how they once distributed $500,000 in BTC to MIT's entire undergraduate population.  CoinDesk: Where did the idea for the MIT Bitcoin Project come from?  Jeremy: I started following bitcoin in late 2011. My sophomore fall, I did a hackathon project called Tidbit with some friends. Tidbit aimed to use browser-based bitcoin mining to replace online ad monetization, but that's a different story.  About six weeks into the spring term, laying in bed one night, I was brainstorming project ideas for a class. I wanted to study the social implications of bitcoin. It just kind of came to me all at once: ""I should give $100 in bitcoin to every computer science student at MIT and see what happens.""  I started shooting off exploratory emails immediately, and I sent one to Dan.  Dan: I got into bitcoin in the summer of 2013, right before starting at MIT Sloan. I thought bitcoin had potential to boost financial inclusion in the developing world. When I read Jeremy's email, I'd just started the MIT Bitcoin Club, where I had put on a couple events.  After a few exchanges, I decided I was all-in to make this happen.  I pushed us early on to go bigger and give bitcoin to all the undergrads, not just CS students, because I thought it would make for a more compelling experiment.  CoinDesk: What was the bitcoin scene like when you started the project?  Dan: In 2014, bitcoin wasn't seen as legitimate yet, even at MIT. Most considered it at best a fad, at worst a Ponzi scheme. My classmates thought I was nuts for starting the Bitcoin Club.  One problem was that there wasn't any traditional community in the world where bitcoin was used and understood. Initiating network effects is really hard. Our goal was to create the first such community at the world's premier technical university. If there was anywhere bitcoin could take off, it was at MIT.  Jeremy: When we started the project, campus involvement with bitcoin was pretty minimal. A number of students knew about it and could half-explain it, but there weren't very many projects happening.  Dan: The Bitcoin Club's first event was a talk by Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire. We closed the doors 10 minutes before the talk was scheduled to start because people had already filled all 200 seats, not including the stairs and the floor. The free dinner was long gone well before the event, so we knew students weren't just there for a free meal.  Jeremy: Before we launched the project, for a class project, I sent out a bitcoin survey. The survey showed mixed awareness among students, with some purporting to be bitcoin experts and others knowing nothing at all about the cryptocurrency. It also showed that my peers were optimistic about the potential of the tech and wanted to learn more. I was jazzed.  Dan: From then on, we saw the MIT Bitcoin Project as an opportunity to catalyze this excitement and jumpstart the creation of a campus ecosystem of both users and developers. We also figured it would be a good headline for bitcoin. Like, 'Hey, if those MIT kids are using it, maybe it really is the future!'  CoinDesk: Were there any major obstacles you faced while doing the project?  Jeremy: I was super worried at the onset of the project about potential controversy. While I was figuring out how to give students bitcoin, I was in the middle of a protracted fight with the State of New Jersey over Tidbit. It would have been awful if a student experimenting with the technology because of the MIT Bitcoin Project found themselves in similar hot water.  Dan: That's why we did the project as an IRB-approved research study, rather than just an activity of the Bitcoin Club. If something went wrong, at least it was MIT-approved. We were fine with that, because we certainly didn’t want to hand out half a million bucks to a bunch of students and not learn anything.  Jeremy: Even though funding was so critical to the project, it was probably the least challenging part. The intersection of MIT alumni and bitcoin enthusiasts were incredibly generous with their financial contributions, especially Alex Morcos, who contributed the most substantially.  CoinDesk: What was your experience like on the big day?  Dan: The coin drop was the main event. We knew it would get attention, but I don't think we realized quite how much. The level of excitement was unreal.  We'd announced the first MIT Bitcoin Expo a week before we announced the coin drop. The announcement drove attendance to around 400 people. The whole event came together in just over a month and we couldn't have done it without last minute support from HackMIT and the Society of Women Engineers.  The Expo was probably the most technical bitcoin conference to have ever occurred. One of MIT's largest and most historic lecture halls, 26-100, was packed with students and bitcoiners. I remember the Armory guys had a bitcoin-script puzzle, and the future MIT Bitcoin Club president solved it first.  Jeremy: My fraternity brother, Richard Ni, helped us coordinate a summer-long lecture series and hackathon called BitComp after that. It was like a mini-incubator. BitComp brought nascent bitcoin startups to MIT (like Chain, Coinbase, Circle, Kraken and Blockchain) to advise participants.  An early form of Enigma was one of the winning projects.  CoinDesk: What was your relationship like with the MIT admins?  Dan: They couldn’t have been more supportive of the project. We involved them early on. They were careful to make clear that MIT was not endorsing bitcoin directly, but made it equally clear that our student-driven initiative with emerging technology, entrepreneurship and experimentation was MIT's bread and butter.  Jeremy: That's how I roped in Joi Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab, to ensure that the project would push the envelope, but not so far as to cause a problem for the administration.  Dan: We also worked with two of my professors from MIT Sloan. Christian Catalini and Catherine Tucker were invaluable collaborators in formalizing our experiment as an IRB-approved study. This ensured the project had a shot at producing high-quality findings, that have been turned into multiple published papers.  CoinDesk: What did the actual distribution of the bitcoin feel like?  Dan: Super exhausting – but exhilarating too.  Jeremy: Definitely nerve-wracking for me. During the sign-up phase, I had to run a database migration to correct a small non-critical bug. It should have been a quick fix, but due to lack of sleep, I managed to mess it up. I had to restore from the back-up database. It ended up taking me four hours or so to correct things.  Dan: Our sign-up was so complicated because we were doing a number of randomized experiments. Students could sign up and provide an address to receive their bitcoin into any wallet of their choice, optionally encrypting the address they sent us. This meant that a lot of work had to go into making sure they had properly set up their wallet and were not going to lose funds.  We also sent the bitcoin out in waves over a span of multiple weeks which layered in more complexity.  Jeremy: The actual distribution of the coins, once we had completed sign-up, was really smooth, though.  CoinDesk: How did students react initially?  Jeremy: At first, a lot of people had no clue they'd received the coins. In the following few days, I got a lot of thank yous in the Infinite, MITs main corridor, and heard a few non-repeatable stories.  Dan: We also saw some interesting behavior with peer interaction during the distribution. Certain dorms held office hours on how to use bitcoin. Some enterprising students offered to fill out the survey on behalf of others for a cut of their coins.  CoinDesk: What were the results of the experiment? Was there anything that surprised you in particular?  Dan: We expected to see more traction on retail and peer-to-peer payments during the experiment. We ended up seeing limited use of bitcoin for both, despite a handful of local merchants accepting the cryptocurrency.  Jeremy: I bought a mango smoothie from a 'bitcoin-ready' burrito joint, but the cashier was confused on how to do it correctly. Despite my protests, they undercharged me.  Dan: I purchased a hat at the Coop, MIT and Harvard’s student store. Not only did it take them five minutes to track down the only iPad in the store set up to take bitcoin, but I had to leave the store to send the transaction because my phone wasn't getting any signal at the register.  Jeremy: Our experience wasn't common though – many students just held onto their coins! I think that retail usability hasn’t improved much since, so we'll see what the coming years bring.  CoinDesk: What's the lasting legacy of the project?  Dan: Christian Catalini and Catherine Tucker published multiple papers on how a nascent network platform can flourish (or languish) depending on how early adopters are segmented, and the ways in which users of the system who claim to value privacy are susceptible to relatively small incentives and tweaks in messaging.  Jeremy: I'm most proud of how well the community at MIT is doing, especially the DCI, the MIT Digital Currency Initiative – currently led by Neha Narula – which was founded as an outgrowth of the MIT Bitcoin Project.  Dan: The MIT Bitcoin Club is still very active, having just hosted the fourth annual MIT Bitcoin Expo. I'm really pleased to see the community at MIT in such a strong position.  Jeremy: What's most amazing to both of us is that, through the last three years, we have both still been so captivated by bitcoin. And to see our captivation with bitcoin shared across MIT a year after we've both graduated is really cool!

42427483,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKViXh,1492776012,Hedge Fund Billionaire Invests 10% Net Worth into Bitcoin and Ether,"A former principal at Fortress Investment Group claims to have invested 10% of his overall net worth into cryptocurrencies.  Speaking at a Harvard Business School forum on Wednesday, Michael Novogratz discussed his outlook on blockchain and digital currencies, according to a report by CNN Money.  Participating on panel that included representatives from Microsoft and CME Group, Novogratz said he has invested in both bitcoin and ether, the cryptocurrency that powers the ethereum blockchain, calling the moves the ""best investment"" of his life, the report said.  CNN further detailed how Novogratz said he invested in ether when it was trading for just $1, having been impressed by ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin at a dinner party held at his home.  According to CoinDesk's Ether Price Index, the cryptocurrency was trading at around $48 at the time of publication.  While such outsized statements may seem unusual from a financial industry veteran, Fortress Investment Group was actually one of the earliest firms to show an interest in the sector, investing into a $150m hedge fund called Pantera Capital in 2014.  Novogratz was notably involved in the early formation of the group, according to reports at the time, serving as co-chief investment officer of Pantera Bitcoin Partners, the fund managed by Pantera Capital.  He would later step down from his position as CIO of the Fortress Macro Fund, which represented roughly 3% of the firm's total assets under management, at the time it was closed.

42427457,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVevh,1492772404,Q1's Top Performing Cryptocurrencies Saw Big Gains,"The first quarter of 2017 saw dramatic price gains for the top cryptocurrencies, as the total market added nearly $7bn in value.  The so-called 'blue chip' cryptocurrencies – those with a market cap greater than $30m – saw aggressive growth in the first quarter, as bitcoin's waning dominance set the stage for new players to assert themselves. Others, too, saw impressive gains that occurred relatively quickly in recent weeks.  All told, the cryptocurrencies posted a median price increase (in USD terms) of 180.56% over the course of the quarter.        Top performers  The two top performers from Q1 2017 were Decred (DCR) and Golem (GNT), which gained 2,410.6% and 835.5%, respectively.  Decred is a cryptocurrency that uses a hybridized consensus system instead of relying on either solely proof-of-work (POS) or proof-of-stake (POW). Similar to bitcoin, the DCR protocol sets a 21 million cap to the number of coins generated on the network.  Currently, the largest trading pair for DCR is DCR/BTC. Poloniex serves as the largest marketplace for DCR trading. The majority of DCR’s gains came toward the end of the quarter, and the highest daily volume was achieved on 27 March with $14.03m.  As for Golem, most of its gains came during the latter half of Q1. Cryptocurrency exchange announced markets for the token on 17th February, and following the announcement, the price rose approximately 100% with 48 hours, from $.02 to $.04 on 19th February, with a volume of $6.67m.  Prior to the Poloniex announcement, average daily volume was between $20k and $100k per day.  A second spike in price occurred on 21st March, following the release of news that GNT would be integrated into Shapeshift.io, an altcoin exchange platform. That particular day, the price increased approximately 22% from $0.045 to $0.055 on $5.28m in 24-hour volume.  The final day of Q1, Golem developer Grzegorz Borowik published a blog post announcing Golem for macOS. The news buoyed the market, which boosted GNT to an all-time-high of $0.094 on volume of $11.4m.  Bitcoin struggles  Bitcoin's performance in the first quarter was more muted.  The CoinMarketCap's Bitcoin Dominance Index – which measures bitcoin's market share relative to other cryptocurrencies – shed nearly 20%, ending the quarter at 68%. A weakening Bitcoin Dominance Index points to investor preference for alternative cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin (BTC) gained just 7.8% over the course of the quarter. This was a noticeable decrease from its 35.4% gain in Q4 2016.  General fear, uncertainty and doubt has permeated the bitcoin community and can arguably be blamed for the anemic performance of the cryptocurrency in comparison to alternatives.  Furthermore, bitcoin's volatility has tapered off as a result of its maturation, coupled with the evolving narrative that the cryptocurrency is a safe-haven asset.

42427467,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVfBh,1492768849,Bitcoin's Unlimited Potential Lies in Its Apolitical Core,"The ongoing bitcoin block size debate has accelerated into a civil war.  From threats of a 51% attack to online trolls to controversy over the allegations surrounding AsicBoost, disagreements on scaling solutions have created a toxic environment, and as a result, the ecosystem growing around bitcoin has started to echo the craziness of party politics.  In these times, we must remember, we have witnessed a failure of national politics.  From the 2008 financial meltdown to vicious cycles of austerity, unprecedented levels of corruption have spawned a global crisis of legitimacy of institutions and governments. And this only seems to have gotten worse.  In the US, at the center of financial and political power, the populace has been trapped by a corporate sponsored political charade, with a rigged presidential primary and the election of what many felt was the lesser of two evils. More and more, people are beginning to wake up to the broken promises and failed policies of their leaders, creating conflicts and instability in regions around the world.  Media echo chamber lies of ""weapons of mass destruction"" that led to the Iraq War are now being repeated with the recent US cruise-missile strike on Syria.  Meanwhile, the global economy stagnates with skyrocketing unemployment and debts that are piling up. While solutions provided in the electoral arena have repeatedly shown to be ineffective, bitcoin presents an alternative – a departure from this system of politics.  Politics as systems of power  So what is politics? What are the characteristics of governance designed by it?  The Oxford Dictionary defines politics as ""activities associated with the governance of a country or area, especially the debate between parties having power.""  Politics is inherently associated with power and is a means to organize society through leaders gaining control over the majority. Western liberal democracy is politically engineered governance. Its fundamental feature is centralization. Rules made from the top are enforced, and changes in the system require permission from those who are in positions of authority.  Historian Howard Zinn (1970) noted:  ""In modern times, when social control rests on 'the consent of the governed', force is kept in abeyance for emergencies, and everyday control is exercised by a set of rules, a fabric of values passed on from one generation to another by the priests and teachers of the society.""  This command-control style of governance works in hierarchies and is antithetical to democratic values. The integrity of the system depends on the success of rulers to foster obedience of those in the network and prevent people from dissenting.  For this, managing perception and public opinion through mass media becomes necessary and the system operates under the appearance of democracy, making force of control covert and invisible.  In ""Democracy INC: The Press and Law in the Corporate Rationalization of the Public Sphere"", professor of journalism David S. Allen (2005) described the role of professionals in facilitating this managed democracy. He noted how the creation of expert knowledge is essential in this machination. Science has become a methodology to back professional legitimacy, as ""individuals began to regard professional judgments, often supported by scientific data as unquestionable.""  The creed of objectivity  Professionals with expert knowledge perform the role of trusted third parties who are supposed to represent the interests of citizens and make decisions on their behalf. Here, the knowledge produced in social science, such as economics, political science and psychology are often used to maintain the status quo of power structures.  From Alan Greenspan to Ben Bernanke and now Janet Yellen, economists who are appointed by the US President as chair of the Federal Reserve get to decide monetary policy for the country and exercise influence through central banks around the world.  What validates their expert knowledge is an epistemological foundation called the ""creed of objectivity"".  Social science has incorporated empirical and positivist methodology of natural science and claimed the ability to form knowledge in a similar way as physical science. With this, researchers assert neutrality as if he or she transcends race, class or any personal bias.  Yet, they are embedded within cultural values and their purported value-free objectivity is not actually possible. One’s subjective agendas and personal views do not magically disappear by simply claiming it to be so.  Without transparency that ensures disclosure of researchers' bias, this creed of objectivity becomes a cloak that hides their motivations, closing off any feedback and ensuring assertions that are not tested are promoted as universally applicable truth.  Money in this representative democracy becomes political money, legitimatised by state authority and tied to monetary policies of investment banks and corporations that run government behind the scenes. A small number of powerful and rich can enact the ideology of neoliberalism and hijack a whole economy. Under the banner of 'free market', they justify their plunder as a crusade for progress.  Replacing politics with math  Now, a breakthrough of computer science has found a way to crack this closed logic of control.  Bitcoin opens a path for changing the world without taking power. The white paper published under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto put forward a vision of a ""peer-to-peer version of electronic cash"", based on cryptographic proof, rather than relying on a trusted third party.  The underpinnings of this innovation was the science of asymmetrical security that provides a strong armory against violence, exploitation and extreme selfishness through a mechanism of consensus.  Richard Feynman, a theoretical physicist once said that scientific integrity is learning to not fool ourselves. He noted: ""The first principle is that you must not fool yourself – and you are the easiest person to fool.""  In natural science, researchers are given honest feedback from the real world and nature through observation, repeated testing and experiments. On the other hand, social scientists explore dimensions more divorced from physical reality, and in their claim of neutrality, they can become blind to their own bias.  This creed of objectivity in social science has shown itself to be vulnerable to tendencies toward deception, while math is a property that is impervious to manipulation. Math cannot be fooled, as it does not respond to lies and threats. Computer science relies on solid data, rigorous testing and peer-review.  This gives each person an opportunity to engage in honest work to overcome self-deception and build strong security, even as strong as the laws in the physical world.  Cypherpunks: scientists with a moral code  In the existing model of governance, inherent weakness in the creed of objectivity made the system vulnerable to the tyranny of the few.  Economic incentives set up by a professional class made the right to free speech exclusive for the beneficiaries of this managed democracy, suppressing any views that challenge this authority. Those privileged in the system call these perspectives subjective, relegating them to mere opinion.  This doctrine of false objectivity that has been predominant in academia has conditioned researchers to remain impartial. This turned the populace into passive observers, preventing them from fully connecting with their passions and values.  In the foundation of bitcoin development, there lies a particular philosophy that revolts against this restriction of free speech imposed by central authority.  In the paper ""The Moral Character of Cryptographic Work"" published in 2015, eminent computer scientist, Phillip Rogaway brought forward the moral obligation of cryptographers and their importance, especially in the post-Snowden era.  In this, he described a group that emerged in the late 1980s who saw the potential of cryptography in shifting power relations between the individual and the state. These are the cypherpunks who held a belief that ""cryptography can be a key tool for protecting individual autonomy threatened by power"".  In an interview with Trace Mayer, applied cryptographer and inventor of Hashcash, Adam Back, talked about the ""positive social implications arising from cryptography"". He described the ethos of cypherpunks as writing code to bring the rights we enjoy offline into the online world.  The idea is that lobbying politicians and promoting issues through the press would be a slow uphill battle. So, instead of engaging in legal and political systems, Back noted that they could simply ""deploy technology and help people do what they consider to be their legal right"" and society would later adjust itself to reflect these values.  The cypherpunks, with their adamant claim of subjective domains, apply real objective knowledge that comes from math to bring change.  Solidifying technology's core  As the forced network effect of petrodollar hegemony begins to loosen, the empire fuels aggression with more wars and sanctions.  While this system of representation weakens, the logic of control from the old world is beginning to infiltrate the bitcoin ecosystem. Regulators try to reach cryptocurrency through exchanges and by enforcing know-your-customer rules, creating a fertile soil for government surveillance and privacy erosion.  Centralization creeps in through industrial mining and patents on hardware, creating a trend toward state and corporate backed monopolies. All the while, the established media keep writing obituaries on bitcoin, wishing to declare the death of this new money they can't understand.  Politics that spread through the crypto-community have been hijacking discussions on technical development.  With PR, name-calling and smear campaigns, people engage in social engineering, distracting developers who are engineering security. This drama that some perceive as bitcoin's existential threat brings a crisis, yet at the same time is giving us all an opportunity to solidify our commitment to this technology’s fundamentals.  Bitcoin as a premise of stateless money has brought many people together.  These are free market enthusiasts, traders, libertarians, engineers, venture capitalists, anarchists and artists. Bitcoin is a disruptive technology that has large political implications.  Yet, for it to manifest its true potential, we must not forget its roots in its apolitical nature – solid science. This apolitical nature is not a bug, but a feature. This is what makes bitcoin stateless money, censorship resistant, unseizable and permissionless.  Our commitment to decentralization keeps this consensus algorithm running across the global network and allows all to participate in this scientific endeavor of proof-of-work – to show the world that the ideas of equality, fraternity and freedom are not just ideals but universal truths.  So, let us call a ceasefire in this political battle and engage in the honest, collaborative work of writing code.  By moving from a system of power to a consensus of equal peers, together we can find solutions to overcome challenges.  Where politicians and leaders have failed, bitcoin succeeds. Our surrender to this scientific process opens a door for development of protocol and gives innovation a chance for humanity to save itself from the mess we have created.

42427465,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVf7h,1492765203,Japanese City Seeks Bitcoin Donations to Preserve Historic Park,"As part of a bid to preserve a historic park, a city in Japan is reportedly raising donations in bitcoin.  The city of Hirosaki, according to a report from national public broadcaster NHK, is collecting funds to maintain more than 2,000 cherry blossom trees, as well as a centuries-old castle.  Supporting the measure is Tokyo-based bitcoin wallet and exchange service Coincheck. According to figures posted on its website, 0.5749 BTC has so far been raised (worth roughly $720 at press time) from 40 contributors.  While small, the amount would no doubt help chip away at the expenses of the park in Hirosaki, as NHK reports the municipality spends hundreds of thousands of dollars per year on upkeep.  The broadcaster also suggested the digital currency has caught the attention of local officials who see it as a possible vehicle for addressing issues related to fundraising more generally.  “Deputy mayor Noboru Yamamoto says the virtual currency may provide a solution to other Japanese local authorities at a time when most are struggling to raise funds,” NHK reported.  Bitcoin has served as a donation tool for much of its history. Groups ranging from the Red Cross of America to Save the Children have turned the cryptocurrency into a way to collect contributions.

42427469,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVfFh,1492745185,Cambodia's Central Bank Signs Deal to Develop Blockchain Tech,"The National Bank of Cambodia has reportedly inked an agreement with distributed ledger tech startup Soramitsu that will find the central bank contributing to its development projects.  Announced todayhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/application-hyperledger-iroha-central-bank-003000950.html  , the goal of the effort is to begin joint work on new payment infrastructure prototypes using DLT systems. But while a host of central banks are studying the technology globally, Soramitsu co-CEO Makoto Takemiya framed the news as unique in that he asserted the central bank has agreed to go beyond ""just studying"" applications.  Founded in 2016, Soramitsu is best known for its management of the Hyperledger Iroha software framework, to which he said National Bank of Cambodia will now be contributing.  Takemiya told CoinDesk:  ""This is extremely exciting because their programmers intimately know what financial institutions need and can help make Hyperledger Iroha ready for systemically important payment systems.""  For the startup, the deal adds to past work that has included trials conducted with Japan-based property insurer Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Holdings, while for National Bank Cambodia, it follows its scarce public statements to date about the technology.  As reported by the Phnom Penh Post in 2014, National Bank of Cambodia had previously said bitcoin does not fall under its definition of a currency.  Meanwhile, the trial comes amid an active time for central bank exploration of the technology, with Bank of England, De Nederlandsche Bank and the People's Bank of China all announcing recent initiatives aimed at investigating its potential.
