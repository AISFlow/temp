42402504,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJzS4,1548369942,Tron CEO Justin Sun Wants to Hire You to Organize His House,"Token-funded blockchain project Tron is not only hiring while others cut staff, it's recruiting an entourage for its founder.  Among the 10 open positions that Tron Group, the company behind the namesake cryptocurrency, posted on Wednesday, two were for aides to the 28-year-old CEO, Justin Sun. These hires would supplement the personal assistant he already has.  One of the jobs Tron is looking to fill is a senior executive assistant to the CEO, who would work with Sun's personal assistant, mentoring the latter and making sure his scheduling is done properly.  Other duties for the senior executive assistant include organizing the CEO's home and dealing with ""maintenance issues"" there; ""packing/unpacking""; running personal errands; and developing extensive knowledge of the Bay Area's restaurants and ""well-known social and recreational spots.""  A college diploma is not required, but a ""24/7 mindset"" is, according to the job postings on LinkedIn and JobVite.  Another job, personal financial accountant for the CEO, requires keeping track of Sun's personal spending, keeping his finances in order, and ensuring ""that transactions are executed in order to optimize the HNWE’s [high net-worth executive] tax position.""  The candidate must speak and write in Mandarin fluently. (Sun is from China, and relocated Tron's headquarters to the U.S.) For this job, a bachelor's degree is required. Neither job posting indicated what the salary would be.  Cliff Edwards, a spokesman for Tron, told CoinDesk these were ""routine hires.""  ""Virtually every CEO under the sun, and certainly everyone I’ve worked with, has had an executive assistant,"" he said by email.  ""Whether the CEO has an accountant is the CEO’s business alone,"" Edwards added. When later asked if that meant the accountant would be paid by Sun himself rather than Tron, he replied:  ""Since Tron is self-funded by Justin, the two are essentially one and the same, although the duties obviously would be in the service of Tron activities.”  Neil Dundon, a professional recruiter specializing in the crypto space, told CoinDesk that hiring multiple assistants for a corporate leader is a normal practice for large enterprises, but unusual for crypto startups.  “Having a personal financial accountant does seem like a luxury,” he said. ""It certainly seems like overkill in the crypto industry with it being so new.""  Flush in a bear market  While these hires might sound like cushy perks for a young startup founder, they are especially notable in light of recent retrenchment by other projects and firms in a prolonged crypto bear market.  Token projects Nebulas and BlockEx, ethereum studio ConsenSys and mining giant Bitmain are among those that have made significant staff reductions.  ""We are keeping the business growing because we are executing,"" said Edwards. ""Companies that are not executing, or that have poorly formed business plans, are retrenching and/or laying off staff.""  Further, Tron may have reason to feel flush these days. Its native token has nearly doubled in value since the beginning of December, from $0.015 to $0.027 Thursday morning, according to CoinMarketCap. The token's market capitalization totals about $1.8 billion, ranking ninth among all cryptocurrencies.  And to be sure, Tron is also looking to fill technical and business positions, not just handlers for Sun.  Other job openings posted Wednesday include two translators from Mandarin to English ""for daily communication with the China team,"" three blockchain engineers of different levels, a technical recruiter, an engineering manager and a business development manager to build a developer community.  According to Edwards, Tron's current staff in the U.S. is about 90 people, and the startup is planning to hire five to ten more in the first quarter of 2019.  Past controversies  Tron raised $70 million during an ICO in 2017, though it later returned some of those funds to Chinese investors after China banned token sales.  This past summer, Tron bought BitTorrent with the hope of boosting adoption of its blockchain with the file sharing service's huge base of 100 million active users. The acquisition was controversial, prompting an employee exodus from BitTorrent. The file-sharing system's creator, Bram Cohen, recently disavowed any connection with Tron or Sun.  Tron recently announced launching BitTorrent's own token BTT, which can be used to incentivize users to share their bandwidth more actively for faster file exchanges. The job descriptions posted Thursday don't mention BitTorrent or BTT.  Tron has also been criticized for its marketing tactics. According to CoinDesk's Crypto-Economics Explorer, social media activity around the native TRON token is 33% that of market bellwether bitcoin, compared to just 7.5% of developer activity.

42402496,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJzLB,1548368127,Overstock's tZERO Token Platform Has Officially Opened for Trading,"Overstock.com's much-anticipated security token trading platform, tZERO, officially began trading Thursday afternoon.  The company announced in a press release that its secondary market for tZERO's own security tokens had gone live, marking the first step toward trading other digital assets on the platform.  Accredited investors can sign up to trade tZERO tokens through Dinosaur Financial Group, LLC, which is acting as the ""introducing,"" or customer-facing, broker-dealer.  TZERO subsidiary Pro Securities LLC is providing the alternative trading system (ATS) to trade the tokens.  Investors in the tZERO token offering have long been waiting for the platform's launch, after its initial unveiling in 2015. Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne announced that the exchange would launch this week during The North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami on January 18, later telling CoinDesk that the technology was ready, but the company needed to finish processing its initial sign-ups first.  The launch is within the timeframe given previously by Jonathan Johnson, president of Overstock subsidiary Medici Ventures, who told CoinDesk last December that the platform would begin trading tZERO tokens by the end of January.  Several days before the launch, some users on the company's Telegram noted that the registration process with Dinosaur, which began earlier this month, had been taking several days to complete. Customers similarly complained that communications with the broker-dealer were prolonged, with even wire transfer confirmations taking days to arrive.  Late Thursday, some investors were still waiting to get started.  “I signed up last week, and tokens listed as pending transfer today. I expect them to be tradable tomorrow,” investor Mark Nelson told CoinDesk. “The account is open so it is approved, just waiting on the completion of the token transfer.”  Long time coming  Overstock has been gearing up to launch tZERO for years. A months-long token sale to raise $134 million, using a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens framework, concluded last August.  The company had previously demonstrated how its platform could operate with a prototype unveiled in April 2018. At the time, tZERO's then-president Joe Cammarata anticipated launching the security token trading software in May 2018.  The company shuffled its leadership last week in anticipation of the launch, shifting Medici's chief operating officer, Steve Hopkins, to act as tZERO's president. In the process, the company promoted Medici's chief technology officer, Joel Weight, to COO of the venture fund.  The company declined to explain what Hopkins' exact role would be.  The company has also been hired by private equity firm GSR Capital to develop a token for trading cobalt. The security token will aid in identifying, tracking and purchasing cobalt, and may ultimately lead to the development of a tZERO-like platform in Asia.  Editor's note: This article has been updated to specify Hopkins' role.  Anna Baydakova contributed reporting.

The companies announced Tuesday that they were teaming up to allow Coinbase and Coinbase Pro clients upload their transactions, gains and losses in 2018 directly to TurboTax Premier, one of the tax firm's products. Coinbase customers can upload as many as 100 transactions at once, according to a press statement from Coinbase.  The integration will work directly through Coinbase's retail platform, or its Android and iOS apps, the exchange said.  TurboTax Premier will then help customers determine how to file their taxes from the last year. Any customers who need additional assistance can tap certified public accountants or enrolled agents at Intuit.  Intuit noted that ""not every cryptocurrency transaction constitutes a taxable event, which is why we have tons of guidance to assist you in understanding and selecting which transactions are taxable while you are in TurboTax Premier.""  In particular, Intuit indicated that customers who converted cryptocurrencies to fiat, sold cryptocurrencies, spent it to pay for goods or services, or received free coins through a fork or airdrop will need to report that as income.  The list of transactions that are not taxable include customers who bought cryptocurrencies and have not yet sold, gifted cryptocurrencies (with each gift valuing less than $15,000 per recipient) or purchased cryptocurrencies with a Self-Directed IRA or Solo 401(k), the release continued.  In addition to working with TurboTax and CoinTracker, Coinbase noted that it was also launching a tax resource center and publishing a ""Crypto and Bitcoin Taxes in the U.S."" guide for 2018 to help its customers understand any tax obligations they may have.  That being said, Coinbase noted that it ""is not authorized to give tax advice,"" and recommended that customers reach out to a tax professional for questions they may have about their specific situations.  Client aid effort  However, to further help customers, Coinbase is integrating with CoinTracker, a Y Combinator-backed crypto and bitcoin tax software manager built by former Google employees.  CoinTracker said in its own release that it would help customers aggregate necessary transaction data across ""all wallets and exchanges"" that they may use, effectively summarizing all transaction activity for 2018.  In a statement, CoinTracker co-founder Chandan Lodha said his team believes an open financial system will improve the world, adding:  ""We can't have an open financial system if it is too difficult to use, or restricted to certain groups. Therefore, we have a simple mission: make cryptocurrency easier to use. We are starting by tackling cryptocurrency taxes.""  The company supports more than 2,500 cryptocurrencies and has automated integrations for 20 of the largest crypto exchanges by volume. The platform is also tracking more than $200 million in crypto assets, CoinTracker said.  In addition to CoinTracker, Intuit is also partnering with crypto tax startups Bitcoin.tax, BitTaxer, CryptoTrader.tax and TokenTax.co to further aid customers.  Brennan Snow, co-founder at BitTaxer, told CoinDesk that he hopes the partnership will help Americans claim losses from their crypto holdings, noting that ""CreditKarma projected that of the $5.1b in BTC losses for Americans last year, only $1.7b will be claimed.""  This may be due to a lack of understanding, he said, a hole he hopes the integrations will solve.

With the news, announced by Dicker on Medium today, he will step down as CEO of the company, taking a role on the advisory board instead. David Turner, currently head of product, will take over as the blockchain startup's top executive.  In his announcement, Dicker wrote of Turner:  ""He’s already been leading both the engineering and product functions for the past few months and is more than equipped to oversee the rest of Po.et.""  Po.et uses the bitcoin blockchain to establish the provenance of digital media, aiming to improve monetization and discovery for content creators.  This will be a return to the Post by Dicker, who previously led the paper's innovation group. The so-called RED team (research, experimentation and development) at the Jeff Bezos–owned company has been credited with using technology to come up with innovative ways to earn revenue on news.  The Post has reportedly had two years of profitability with strong revenue growth despite a generally chilly climate for media, according to Axios.  According to his LinkedIn, Turner previously worked in social media analytics and scalable marketing.  In his announcement, Dicker said that it had been a strong year for Po.et, while also suggesting results also didn't seem to quite meet expectations. He wrote:  ""We built a team that aimed to drive at 100 mph all the time. We’ve found that this has been the core component of our success but has also humbled us. The reality is that we’re facing a long road to adoption.""  Po.et parted with five members of its engineering team last December, as reported by The Block.  It wasn't the only company in this space to meet headwinds.  Civil, a ConsenSys ""spoke"" that aimed to improve the monetization of digital news companies, has struggled to generate financial support from either cryptocurrency enthusiasts or news junkies.  At the Post  , Dicker will be responsible for driving further innovation in revenue strategies across the company's operations. His previous role at the paper was VP of Commercial Product and Innovation.  Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly listed Dicker as a founder of Po.et.

42402486,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJzBL,1548350110,"IBM, Aetna, PNC Explore Medical Data Blockchain for 100 Million Health Plans","IBM is collaborating with a group of major players in the healthcare space to improve the way sensitive data is shared and make health claims and transactions more efficient – all in the form of a ""blockchain-based ecosystem.""  Announced today, Big Blue is joined in this effort by Aetna (acquired last November by pharmacy and health plan provider CVS Health), health plan provider Anthem, Health Care Service Corporation (the largest customer-owned health insurance provider in the U.S.) and PNC Bank. These providers combined account for close to 100 million healthcare plans.  IBM said additional members will join the Health Utility Network in the coming months, including other health organizations, healthcare providers, startups, and technology companies.  Barbara Hayes, IBM general manager for payers at IBM Watson Health told CoinDesk:  ""IBM is one of the founding members, but everybody has an equal stake across those founding members. It's so important because you do have competitors side by side who are going after tremendous amounts of waste that is in the healthcare system; 40 cents, 50 cents on the dollar.""  Hayes said transforming industries such as healthcare means going after insights and advanced predictions using data and eliminating waste or inefficiencies. ""In healthcare, these inefficiencies are in clinical areas and in administrative areas - or just friction that happens in the system which leads to bad customer experience,"" she said.  Dr. Bill Lafontaine, IBM, general manager of intellectual property, added:  ""We are going to provide the SDKs and other ways to link to the platform. We are leaving this very open because many of the members are bringing different technologies that they have already been investing in and so they get a faster return on that investment.""  Competing projects  However, IBM is far from the only tech firm trying to leverage the immutability and transparency of blockchain for the siloed and fragmented healthcare industry. Other prominent names in blockchain healthcare include Change Healthcare, Hashed Health, Guardtime, Gem and SimplyVital - to name a few.  In such a busy space it’s not surprising IBM is faced with some consortia competition. For example, in April of last year, Humana and United Health Group, two of the largest health insurers, teamed up on a blockchain pilot with data providers Quest Diagnostics, Multiplan and Optum.  Another healthcare blockchain called ProCredEx launched in November last year. It focuses on storing and sharing the credentials of medical and dental practitioners and is expected to save time and costs within the industry.  Outside of healthcare, PNC Bank has been public about its blockchain activities, joining a group of banks exploring Ripple’s xCurrent payment system for cross-border transactions.  Chris Ward, head of product for PNC Treasury Management, said in a statement that the healthcare collaboration with IBM will make it easier for the patient, payer and provider to handle payments, adding,  “Using this technology, we can remove friction, duplication, and administrative costs that continue to plague the industry.”  IBM logo image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/01/24/ibm-aetna-pnc-explore-medical-data-blockchain-for-100-million-health-plans,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5d0c9abd7f84c0d68fd2dde5a1e7ae217c795868-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42402490,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJzFH,1548349373,"XRP Market Cap May Be Overstated by Billions, Messari Report Estimates","A new report from crypto data startup Messari estimates that the true market capitalization and circulating supply of the digital asset XRP is markedly less than what data sources currently present.  As depicted on data providers like CoinMarketCap as well as Ripple – the distributed ledger tech company closely linked to the digital asset – XRP’s circulating supply is pegged at roughly 41 billion tokens. But in its report, Messari posits that of that figure, 19.2 billion XRP “may be illiquid or subject to significant selling restrictions” tied to daily trading volume, including ""at least 6.7 billion XRP"" held by Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb that are subject to an agreement between him and Ripple.  In addition, Messari said that it believes that the circulation figure includes 5.9 billion XRP pledged by Ripple co-founder to a nonprofit entity called RippleWorks, an amount that it contended hasn’t been delivered. As well, Messari identified 2.5 billion XRP held by RippleWorks that are also subject to daily selling restrictions.  Further, the report also estimates that as much as 4.1 billion XRP sold via XRP II, Ripple’s money-services business, is also subject to selling restrictions. But Messari notes that “it is impossible to track the magnitude of this illiquidity without direct disclosures from Ripple, so we use a reasonable estimate.”  All told, these factors have led to the market cap of XRP being “likely overstated” by more than $6 billion, according to Messari’s reasoning.  Following the publication of this report, a spokesperson for Ripple disputed Messari's findings, telling CoinDesk:  ""Not only does this report contain several inaccurate assumptions around lockups and selling restrictions, the entire report is based on an incorrect calculation of market cap. While decentralized digital assets like XRP are different from traditional equities, the term 'market cap' is always a very simple calculation: current price X total number of the asset = market capitalization. That puts XRP's current market cap at approximately $31 billion. We believe that any other calculation of market capitalization for XRP is not a clear representation of the truth.""  In its report, Messari estimated that the figure could ultimately be higher, explaining:  ""In reality, this estimate may prove to be conservative, as they belie XRP trading volumes which have consistently fallen well below that of EOS and Litecoin, two cryptoassets whose current referenced market caps are a mere 17% and 15% of XRP’s, respectively. In addition, we believe the actual amount of 'restricted' XRP in distributions to investors, banking partners, and team member may be significantly higher than our initial estimates reflect.""  The report notes that it sought input from Ripple and RippleWorks before the report’s publication but hadn't heard from the company, which Messari contended results in questions about how the restrictions work in practice.  ""Ripple has not shared the methodology or reference exchange data it uses to calculate trading volume for XRP, a critical data point that drives selling restrictions. More than 99% of XRP trading volume appears to come from overseas exchanges, many of which have been suspected of wash trading,"" the report states.  On Thursday, Ripple released its Q4 report, noting that average daily XRP volume was $585.7 million. The firm sold $88.88 million programatically – an increase compared to its third-quarter figure of $65.27 million – and $40.15 million in ""institutional direct sales,"" representing a decrease from Q3's $98.06 million.  Editor's Note: A previous version of this report linked to a 2014 agreement between Jed McCaleb and Ripple regarding McCaleb's XRP holdings. The link has been updated to reflect information about a superseding agreement.

Europol announced Wednesday that the British man is suspected of stealing around €10 million ($11.34 million) worth of iota tokens in January 2018 from the wallets of over 85 victims worldwide.  An investigation was launched in early 2018 after reports a number of thefts from iota wallets in Germany. Hessen State Police ultimately traced the possible suspect to the U.K. and a coordinated operation led by the Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce, hosted by Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre, was launched.  The UK’s South East Regional Organised Crime Unit (SEROCU) and National Crime Agency (NCA) also participated in the operation.  The investigation found that the thefts took place by targeting users of a now-defunct website that created 81-digit security seeds for iota wallets, according to the announcement.  Europol said:  “Several victims created the seed on this website in good faith, however the seeds were stored in the background by the service provider. Later the criminal used these to gain access to the victims’ wallets and transferred their money to other wallets created with fake IDs.”  SEROCU arrested the man on suspicion of fraud, theft and money laundering in the city of Oxford yesterday and also seized a number of computers and electronic devices.  Back in September, Europol warned against the rising threats of crypto hacks, extortion and mining malware, saying that the holdings of those using digital currencies, as well as exchanges, are increasingly at risk as “criminal abuse” of the financial technology grows.  The agency also arrested 11 individuals last April for laundering more than €8 million (or $9 million) from Spain to Colombia through an unnamed cryptocurrency and credit cards via a Finnish crypto exchange.

A Business Insider report on Thursday citing “people familiar with the matter” said that the fund would offer loans in U.S. dollars to struggling crypto firms because the demand for credit is on the rise amid the current bear market.  Loans would have to be backed by collateral such as crypto tokens, crypto mining devices and property, according to the report. Galaxy Digital is expected to close the first round of fundraising in March.  With the extended downturn in crypto prices, Galaxy Digital has not been having the best of times. Back in November, Novogratz told the Financial Times that 2018 had been tough for his company, saying it “sucks to build a business in a bear market.”  The firm also occurred losses last year. It reported a net loss of $76.65 million for the third quarter of 2018 – that accounted for more than a third of its nine-month loss of $175.68 million as of Sept. 30, 2018.  But despite all this, Novogratz, a former Goldman Sachs partner, is not being tight on the purse strings.

42402492,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJzHF,1548336453,Augur Interface Veil Acquires Search Engine for Prediction Markets,"Venture-backed startup Veil has acquired Predictions.Global, the leading site for exploring data on Augur prediction markets.  ""It’s certainly been the most used and popular third party-developed Augur product thus far,"" Veil co-founder Paul Fletcher-Hill told CoinDesk in an email.  Veil called Predictions.Global ""the CoinMarketCap for the Augur ecosystem"" in an announcement post on Medium.  Augur is a decentralized protocol on ethereum that makes it possible to create prediction markets around anything. Predictions.Global currently lists all the open betting markets running on Augur (388, as of this writing).  Augur was built with an initial coin offering in 2015. But as well as the protocol works, it's very technically demanding to use. Enter Veil, sporting a user interface that makes it much faster and easier to place bets on a limited number of topics. At launch, Veil revealed that it had raised a seed round from a group of investors that includes Sequoia Capital and 1confirmation.  For Veil's mainnet launch earlier this month, supported markets included crypto-derivatives for BTC, REP and ZRX; bets on which film will win Best Picture at the 2019 Academy Awards; and more recently, a market for the upcoming Super Bowl.  Veil hopes Predictions.Global will help drive users to its site. ""One change you’ll notice is that markets that are supported by Veil will start to include a link to trade on Veil,"" Fletcher-Hill told CoinDesk.  Big picture  Veil currently supports a fraction of the kinds of markets that currently exist on Augur. ""Ultimately we want to support as many markets as possible,"" Fletcher-Hill said.  Veil promises users two benefits over using Augur directly: placing bets without paying gas fees and instant settlement for markets where Veil is confident the outcome will be clear at the end of the relevant event.  In other words, users usually have to wait quite a while for an Augur market to pay out, but Veil will pay users instantly if that feature is supported.  ""Veil purchases the shares from users and then redeems those shares from Augur directly,"" Fletcher-Hill said. It costs users a 1 percent fee, but they don't have to wait.  That said, Veil is also non-custodial. Users don't have to give Veil control of their funds. On the other hand, this means they will have to use dapp wallets (which are their own UX headache), such as Metamask or Coinbase Wallet.  Nick Tomaino of 1confirmation compared the new company's potential to one of the industry's bigger success stories:  ""Similar to the way that Coinbase aggregated a lot of the talent and mindshare necessary to bring the nascent bitcoin protocol to more users back in 2013, Veil is doing the same around the nascent Augur protocol in 2019.""  This story has been updated (Jan. 24, 16:33 UTC) with comment from 1confirmation partner Nick Tomaino.

42402485,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJzAM,1548334847,Jamaica Stock Exchange Plans to List Security Tokens,"The Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE) is planning to list security tokens as tradeable assets for clients.  The JSE’s Canadian technology partner Blockstation announced last week that the two firms have completed the first stage of a 60-day live cryptocurrency trading pilot.  Marlene Street Forrest, the JSE’s managing director said the trial has been “very smooth” so far and that the exchange is “quite happy” with the results.  She continued:  “We are looking forward to moving to the next stage of the pilot which would eventually include the listing of security tokens.”  The first stage of the pilot saw participation from regulated broker-dealers, market makers and the Jamaica Central Securities Depository (JCSD).  The ultimate objective of the pilot is to “demonstrate the complete lifecycle of the digital asset ecosystem,” according to the announcement. That included setting up the platform, managing participants and conducting trading. The JCSD managed the clearing, settlement and custody of cash and cryptocurrencies, and oversaw compliance reporting and reconciliation across participants.  The JSE partnered with Blockstation back in August 2018 to create the new digital assets trading platform.  Forrest told CoinDesk at the time: “The end game at the end of the day is to trade tokens, the end game is smart contracts, the end game is to provide that area of the market that would like this product, to start to do so in a secure manner.”  An increasing number of platforms have been moving to offer trading in security tokens in recent weeks.  Just yesterday, crypto startups Zilliqa and MaiCoin partnered to build a centralized security token exchange called Hg Exchange in Singapore. The platform aims to ultimately tokenize shares of big-name private companies, including AirBnb, Uber and SpaceX.  Last week, European blockchain startup Currency.com launched a trading platform for tokenized securities, allowing investors to directly trade and invest in financial instruments using cryptocurrencies.  And, earlier this month, Estonia-based crypto startup DX.Exchange launched a trading platform allowing clients to purchase crypto tokens representing shares in different tech firms listed on Nasdaq.

42402503,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJzR5,1548327651,Bitcoin Price Defends $3.5K After Cboe Pulls ETF Proposal,"With bitcoin (BTC) showing resilience to negative news flow, a strong bullish move is looking increasingly likely.  On Wednesday, the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s (CBOE) BZX equity exchange withdrew its request for a rule change by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that would have allowed it to list a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) backed by VanEck and SolidX.  The market narrative with respect to the ETF is that its approval could trigger the next bull run in the leading cryptocurrency by market value. Moreover, in the past, markets have responded negatively to delays or rejections in ETF approval.  The latest ETF withdrawal, however, has barely moved the needle for BTC's price. The cryptocurrency continues to trade in a sideways manner above the crucial support at $3,500.  The calm response to the bearish news could be considered a sign of seller exhaustion – more so, as the primary trend is still bearish. As a result, the cryptocurrency could soon end the 14-day-long consolidation with a bullish breakout.  Further, the Cboe ETF – first filed with the SEC in June 2018 – had experienced several delays in the past. As a result, the bar of expectation was set low and was likely priced in by traders.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,540 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.70 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  Daily chart  On the daily chart, BTC has created a descending triangle, which comprises a horizontal line connecting a strong support level and a falling trendline representing lower highs.  A UTC close above the upper edge of the triangle, currently at $3,630, would confirm the breakout and could yield a rally to the psychological resistance of $4,000.  The odds of the bull breakout look good, as the ETF news failed to embolden the bears and gold is feeling the pull of gravity (as discussed yesterday, BTC and gold look to be inversely related).  View  BTC’s defense of $3,500 amid the bearish news flow likely indicates seller exhaustion. As a result, the prospects of cryptocurrency witnessing a triangle breakout on the daily chart are high. A bull breakout, if confirmed, would expose resistance lined up at $4,000.  A triangle breakdown – i.e. a close below $3,470 – would validate the bearish setup on the weekly chart and increase the odds of a drop to the December low of $3,122.

According to a report from Tencent’s news portal Finance.QQ on Thursday, HKEX CEO Charles Li Xiaojia said that companies seeking to list on the stock exchange must have a ""sustainable"" business model.  While Li did not talk about specific company applications, he answered in general about HKEX listing requirements in a response to a question on the crypto miner IPO filings from the news source. Three top crypto mining companies, Bitmain, Canaan and Ebang, have all filed to list on the HKEX, but none has received approval to date.  Li said that, if a company has made billions of dollars through one business, then suddenly says it will do some other business without demonstrating past performance, it could mean that the company’s first business model is “not sustainable.”  If so, the question for the HKEX is, ""Can you still do this business, can you make this money?""  The HKEX will “adhere to the principle of market adaptability"" when reviewing companies’ IPO applications, including those of crypto miners, he added.  Bitmain  filed its IPO application with the HKEX in September of last year, while Canaan and Ebang filed in May and June, respectively.  There have already been signs that the HKEX is reluctant to approve Bitmain’s IPO, however. Last month, a person involved in the talks told CoinDesk that the exchange is “very hesitant to actually approve these bitcoin mining companies because the industry is so volatile.”  Ebang, on the other hand, refiled its draft IPO prospectus last month, but stated in the filing that it saw “significant decreases” in revenue and gross profit in Q3 2018.  With the delays, Canaan is now reportedly considering an IPO in the U.S., which could launch in the first half of this year in New York, although the process is still in its early stages.

42402497,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdJzN9,1548320444,OKCoin Founder Buys Hong Kong-Listed Firm in $60 Million Deal,"Mingxing ""Star"" Xu, the founder of cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin, has become the largest individual shareholder of a public company listed in Hong Kong via a $60 million acquisition.  LEAP Holdings Group, the construction engineering firm acquired, announced the competed deal on Wednesday. OKC Holdings Corp, the parent company of OKCoin, purchased about 3.2 billion shares of the company for HK$0.15 (around $0.02) per share to achieve the takeover, it said.  OKC Holdings is now the largest shareholder of LEAP Holdings, owning 60.49 percent of its stock and having the same percentage of voting rights. As a result, the exchange is a step closer to a possible back-door listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX).  Xu holds the majority stake in OKC Holdings with 52.32 percent ownership through two firms StarXu Capital and OKEM Services Company.  Other notable shareholders of OKC Holdings include Gang Mai, who holds 5.08 percent stake via Vlab Capital, and Bo Feng of Ceyun Ventures holding 9.86 percent through Golden Status Ventures. Mai also has another joint fund called Venturelab jointly created with the U.S.-based venture capitalist Tim Draper. Jing Shi, daughter of Chinese billionaire entrepreneur Yuzhu Shi, also invested in OKC Holdings and owns 13 percent.  OKC Holdings initially filed for the application with the HKEX on Jan. 10 to buy the controlling stake in LEAP Holdings Group, with the deal closing in just two weeks.  Crypto exchanges are increasingly looking to opt for a reverse-merger route to become publicly listed companies, rather than going for a conventional IPO, which is a lengthy and complex process.  Just yesterday, the holding company of South Korea's Bithumb exchange signed a binding letter of intent agreement with U.S.-listed investment firm Blockchain Industries for a reverse merger.  And, last August, Singapore-based crypto exchange Huobi took a similar step, acquiring 66.26 percent of a HKEX-listed firm called Pantronics Holdings for around $70 million.  Billionaire investor Michael Novogratz also chose the reverse takeover route in July 2018, merging his crypto merchant bank, Galaxy Digital, with Toronto-listed shell company Bradmer Pharmaceuticals to become publicly listed in Canada.

The Cboe BZX exchange has withdrawn a proposed rule change that would have, if approved, paved the way for an ever-elusive bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) backed by VanEck and SolidX.  The announcement, however, did little to spur investors into selling, leaving others to speculate that the events of the day were already priced in days before.  Daily chart  The daily chart shows stagnation for the entire trading session with a small $80 rangebound candlestick providing evidence of little interest in the bitcoin and crypto market in the last 24 hours.  Total growing volume has dropped significantly in recent weeks and is typically quite low during unsettled periods. Low volume also reflects a lack of confidence that usually leads to long periods of consolidation and sideways momentum, similar to the one bitcoin is currently experiencing after a disappointing start to 2019.  The relative strength index (RSI), used to judge the momentum of a given trend, dipped on the news and is resting in bearish territory below the RSI resistance at 54.9.  An $800 price range has also trapped momentum for a period of 36 days now, raising concerns about BTC's ability to hold current price levels for any sustainable period and possibly seeing another sell-off toward $3,000.  View  The crypto markets appear unfazed by the announcement of the Cboe ETF withdrawal.  Total volume has been falling week-to-week, with the exception of Dec. 10 and Dec. 31, underscoring the current period of consolidation.  Price action has been trapped within an $800 range while other relatable news appears to have been having little impact on price as of late.

Further, the exchange said it hopes to provide investors access to both new ventures and established, closely held tech giants:  ""It is envisaged that Hg Exchange will provide access to high-growth startups and also decacorns [companies valued above $10 billion] such as Uber, Airbnb, Space X, Grab and Didi Chuxing, which are currently not within reach of the average investor.""  Hg added that Zilliqa, which is aiming to launch its own blockchain mainnet on Jan. 31, will facilitate the tokenization process of private company shares on its network. However, there is already a precedent for tokenizing existing shares. DX.Exchange, for example, lists ethereum tokens that it says are backed 1-for-1 by publicly traded stock held by a third party, and Swarm has done this with private company equity (much to those companies' chagrin).  Hg added that it will allow founders, employees and other shareholders to monetize their shares.  Combining private equity and other traditional asset classes with blockchain technology can ""liquefy previously illiquid assets,"" Alex Liu, MaiCoin's CEO, said in a statement.  Early members  The exchange has already signed a memorandum of intent with its first four members: Phillip Securities, PrimePartners, RHT Capital and Fundnel.  Fundnel co-founder and CEO Kelvin Lee said in a statement that future investors will be looking for different assets and products than those at present, spurred by ongoing digitization.  ""The digital-first strategy adopted by Hg Exchange is envisioned to seamlessly connect private enterprises with the right investors, and also democratize the capital market by providing investors with a chance to participate alongside their institutional counterparts,"" he said.  Any financial intermediaries signing up to the exchange need to be licensed to conduct activities by the Monetary Authority of Sinagpore (MAS), Hg noted. The exchange has also applied to participate in MAS' FinTech Regulatory Sandbox. The company said the usual approval process could take a few weeks to several months.  A spokesperson for Hg told CoinDesk that while minimum investment amounts should be lower than at current private investment platforms, only institutional or accredited investors can participate at launch.  Further, individual investors would have to participate through one of the exchange's members.  'Real world use cases'  Zilliqa  operates what it calls a ""high-throughput public blockchain platform,"" and claims to solve scaling issues with sharding, which breaks the main blockchain up into separate, smaller units to more efficiently process transactions. (Sharding is on the scaling roadmap for ethereum, the world's second-largest blockchain, but is estimated to be two years away.)  ""Rather than blockchain for blockchain's sake, it’s important to look at how blockchain technology can solve existing challenges holding industries back,"" Zilliqa co-founder and CEO Xinshu Dong said in a statement. ""Within the private investment industry, blockchain can provide greater standardization, fractionalization, and enables trading on a regulated venue at lower costs.""  He added:  ""Our aim is to continue to focus on real-world use cases to accelerate the mainstream adoption of blockchain, and move the industry towards meaningful growth.""  MaiCoin  , meanwhile, is a digital asset exchange platform that offers both trading and payment services out of Taiwan. It will build the exchange functions, including the matching engine and order book.  On the user side, MaiCoin will be providing multi-factor authentication and transaction signing technologies to ensure security.
