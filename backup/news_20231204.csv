21061279,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561024,1701734397,What Is Web3 Gaming? Top Web3 Games And Crypto Companies,"Web3 gaming represents a revolutionary intersection of blockchain technology and interactive entertainment, heralding a new era in the gaming industry. This article serves as your comprehensive guide to understanding the intricacies of Web3 gaming, providing insights into the top web3 games and web3 gaming companies that are leading this digital transformation. Whether you’re a seasoned gamer curious about the transition from traditional to Web3 gaming, or a crypto enthusiast eager to understand the synergy between gaming and blockchain, this guide has you covered. We’ll introduce you to the best web3 games that are redefining player experience and discuss the innovative mechanics that set these games apart. Additionally, our curated list of top Web3 games will serve as a valuable resource for enthusiasts and gamers alike. What Is Web3 Gaming? Web3 gaming, at its core, is an innovative fusion of traditional gaming elements with the decentralized, secure, and transparent features of blockchain technology. Unlike traditional gaming, where the game’s data and assets are centrally controlled, Web3 gaming introduces a decentralized approach. This paradigm shift allows players to have true ownership of in-game assets, such as skins, characters, and virtual real estate, in the form of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This ownership is verifiable and transferable across different platforms, thanks to the underlying blockchain technology. The integration of cryptocurrencies in Web3 gaming also introduces novel monetization models, including Play to Earn (P2E). In these models, players can potentially earn cryptocurrency rewards for their in-game achievements and participation, adding a layer of financial incentive that goes beyond traditional gaming experiences. Another hallmark of Web3 gaming is the emphasis on decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). These player-driven governance structures enable a more democratic and transparent way of making decisions about the game’s future, including updates and rule changes. This level of player involvement is unprecedented in traditional gaming paradigms. The Rise of Web3 Games The rise of Web3 games can be traced back to the increasing interest in blockchain technology and the success of early blockchain-based games like “CryptoKitties,” which demonstrated the potential for integrating blockchain with gaming. This success sparked a wave of innovation, leading to more sophisticated and engaging Web3 games. Web3 games have gradually evolved to offer complex gameplay and rich narratives, rivaling their traditional counterparts. This evolution is driven by advancements in blockchain technology, enabling faster transaction speeds, improved scalability, and enhanced user experience. As a result, these games have started to attract not just blockchain enthusiasts but also mainstream gamers. The rise is also fueled by the increasing awareness and acceptance of cryptocurrencies and NFTs among the general public. As people become more comfortable with these concepts, the barrier to entering Web3 gaming diminishes, leading to a broader and more diverse player base. Another factor contributing to the rise of Web3 games is the growing interest from traditional gaming studios and developers in exploring blockchain technology. This interest is leading to partnerships, investments, and development efforts aimed at creating hybrid models that blend the best of both worlds – the immersive experiences of traditional gaming with the innovative features of Web3. The rise of Web3 games marks a significant shift in how we perceive and interact with digital content. It represents not just a new form of entertainment but also a new economy where players have a real stake and say in the gaming worlds they inhabit. Top Web3 Games List The landscape of Web3 games is rich and varied, offering a multitude of experiences that cater to different tastes and interests. These games are not just technologically advanced but also creatively diverse, ranging from simple collectibles and strategy games to complex virtual worlds with rich narratives. In this segment, we explore some of the best Web3 games that have captivated players worldwide. Overview Of The Best Web3 Games To understand what makes a Web3 game stand out, it’s essential to look at the best examples in the market: Axie Infinity: Often likened to Pokémon, this game allows players to collect, breed, and battle creatures called Axies. What sets it apart is its robust economy, where players can earn cryptocurrency through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. Decentraland: More than just a game, Decentraland is a virtual world where players can buy, develop, and trade land and assets, all verified on the Ethereum blockchain. It’s a prime example of a virtual economy where players have true ownership and control over their digital assets. The Sandbox: This is a community-driven platform where players can create, own, and monetize their gaming experiences. The use of NFTs and the game’s native cryptocurrency, SAND, allows for a unique player-driven economy. CryptoKitties: As one of the earliest introductions of NFTs to the mainstream, CryptoKitties allows players to buy, collect, breed, and sell virtual cats. Its simplicity and novelty factor have made it a staple in the discussion of NFT-based games. Sorare: Merging the world of fantasy sports with blockchain, Sorare lets players collect, trade, and play with officially licensed digital cards of soccer players. It’s an excellent example of how real-world sports can intersect with Web3 gaming. Illuvium: An open-world RPG game built on the Ethereum blockchain, Illuvium offers a visually stunning experience with a decentralized governance model, allowing players to participate in the game’s decision-making process. Gods Unchained: A strategic trading card game that empowers players by offering real ownership of their cards. It combines traditional card game strategies with the unique benefits of blockchain technology. Aavegotchi: This game blends elements of DeFi (decentralized finance) with NFT collectibles. Players can stake tokens on their Aavegotchis, enhancing their attributes and increasing their value. Popular Web3 Game Mechs (Mechanics) The mechanics of Web3 games are what distinguish them from traditional gaming, introducing new layers of engagement and interaction. Here are some of the most popular mechanics found in Web3 games: True Digital Ownership: Players have real ownership of their in-game assets, thanks to blockchain technology. These assets, often NFTs, can be bought, sold, or traded on various marketplaces, providing players with tangible value for their in-game achievements. Play to Earn (P2E): This model allows players to earn real-world value, often in the form of cryptocurrencies, for their in-game activities. P2E mechanics have revolutionized the gaming industry by providing financial incentives for gameplay. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): Many Web3 games use DAOs for governance, allowing players to vote on key decisions regarding game updates, rules, and future development. This fosters a sense of community and gives players a stake in the game’s direction. Interoperability: Unlike traditional games, where assets are confined to the game they were created for, Web3 games often allow for asset interoperability across multiple games and platforms, enhancing the utility and value of in-game assets. Tokenization: In-game currencies are often tokenized as cryptocurrencies. This not only enables easy transactions within and outside the game but also integrates with the broader DeFi ecosystem, opening up new financial opportunities for players. Provable Scarcity And Rarity: Blockchain enables the creation of items with provable scarcity and unique attributes, increasing their collectability and value. Smart Contract Functionality: These self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code govern transactions within Web3 games, ensuring fairness and transparency. Web3 Gaming Companies And Crypto The surge in Web3 gaming has given rise to a new breed of gaming companies that are at the forefront of blending blockchain technology with interactive entertainment. These companies are not only game developers but innovators who are reshaping the gaming landscape with their unique approaches to decentralized gaming and cryptocurrency integration. Leading Web3 Gaming Companies Here are some of the leading companies that are making significant strides in the Web3 gaming space: Sky Mavis: The creators of ‘Axie Infinity,’ Sky Mavis, have established themselves as a powerhouse in the Web3 gaming world. Their innovative approach to Play to Earn gaming and NFT integration has set new standards in the industry. Animoca Brands: Known for backing ‘The Sandbox’ and other blockchain ventures, Animoca Brands is a key player in the space, with a vision to drive digital property rights via NFTs and build an open metaverse. Dapper Labs: The company behind ‘CryptoKitties’ and the Flow blockchain, Dapper Labs, has been instrumental in bringing blockchain to the mainstream through their engaging and accessible games. Sorare: As the minds behind the popular fantasy football game that uses blockchain, Sorare has carved a niche in combining sports with Web3 gaming, creating a unique and compelling experience. Decentral Games: Operating in the virtual world of Decentraland, Decentral Games is pioneering in the realm of decentralized virtual casinos and gaming experiences, blending entertainment with player-owned economies. Mythical Games: With their focus on building games where players are part-owners and stakeholders, Mythical Games is pushing the boundaries of how games are played, shared, and monetized. Enjin: Known for creating an ecosystem for NFTs that can be used across various games, Enjin is a significant contributor to the concept of a multiverse where assets are interoperable across different gaming platforms. The Role Of Crypto In Web3 Gaming Cryptocurrency plays a pivotal role in the ecosystem of Web3 gaming, fundamentally altering how value is created, distributed, and exchanged within games. Here are key ways in which crypto is integral to Web3 gaming: Facilitating In-Game Transactions: Cryptocurrencies provide a seamless medium for transactions within Web3 games. Whether it’s purchasing items, trading assets, or paying for services, crypto ensures fast, secure, and borderless transactions. Enabling True Digital Ownership: Through the use of crypto wallets, players have real ownership of their in-game assets. This not only adds a layer of security but also allows players to have control over their assets outside the game environment. Play To Earn (P2E) Model: This innovative model rewards players with cryptocurrency for gameplay and achievements. It’s a significant shift from traditional gaming models, offering players not just entertainment but also a potential source of income. Governance And Voting: In many Web3 games, players use cryptocurrencies as governance tokens, allowing them to participate in the decision-making process for the game’s development and updates. Staking And Yield Farming: Some Web3 games incorporate elements of DeFi, allowing players to stake their crypto tokens to earn rewards or to enhance their in-game assets and abilities. Creating A Decentralized Economy: Cryptocurrencies are central to creating a player-driven economy within games, where the value is determined by the community and market dynamics, rather than by the game developers alone. Web3 Game Developers: Pioneers of the Industry Web3 game developers are at the cutting edge of integrating blockchain technology with gaming. The latest report by Footprint Analytics for October 2023 reveals a landscape of both opportunities and challenges. Despite a significant growth in token market capitalization, developers face hurdles in user acquisition and retention. With 73.1% of games having fewer than 10 active users, it’s clear that while the industry is expanding, with a total of 2,651 games, attracting and keeping players engaged remains a key challenge. Notably, the web3 game development landscape is geographically diverse, with the Asia-Pacific region leading the charge, hosting 40% of Web3 game developers. Notably, the United States remains a significant market, accounting for 30% of Web3 game development teams. South Korea has also emerged as a key player, contributing 27% to the Web3 gaming teams, nearly doubling its involvement from the previous year​. Upcoming Web3 Games To Watch The Footprint Analytics report highlights an interesting development with the upcoming release of “Gas Hero” by Find Satoshi Lab, known for their successful game “StepN.” Set for a community beta in late 2023, “Gas Hero” is an MMO set in a sci-fi world, distinct from “StepN’s” focus on physical activity. It’s expected to bring a fresh narrative and immersive experience to the Web3 gaming space, using Polygon blockchain and leveraging GMT tokens. Trends, Data, And Predictions For Web3 Gaming The Footprint Analytics report underscores a crucial trend in the Web3 gaming industry: while the number of games is increasing, active user growth is lagging, with only a small proportion of games having more than 1,000 monthly active users. This suggests a “false boom,” raising questions about the industry’s sustainability. Despite these challenges, the industry sees promising developments. For instance, Sega’s co-COO Shuji Utsumi expressed optimism about blockchain gaming and NFTs, marking a shift in attitude from traditional gaming giants. Furthermore, the dominance of blockchains like BNB, Ethereum, and Polygon in hosting Web3 games is evident, with new partnerships, such as Immutable’s collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS), aiming to provide infrastructure solutions for Web3 gaming. The market capitalization of Web3 gaming tokens has seen a notable increase in October 2023, aligning with Bitcoin’s surge. Standout projects like Axie Infinity have shown resilience and growth, suggesting that despite the broader market conditions, there is potential for success in the Web3 gaming sector. Still Early, But A Nascent Industry Moreover, the Web3 gaming sector has seen significant investments, with a reported $19 billion funneled into related projects since 2018. Despite a market correction in 2022, investment in Web3 gaming stabilized in 2023, maintaining pre-bull market levels. Notably, sports, MMOs, RPGs, and action game genres have attracted the most funding​​. The majority of the Web3 gaming ecosystem comprises indie-level and midsize projects, with high-budget AA & AAA titles being relatively scarce. RPG, action, strategy, and casual games dominate the genre spectrum. Interestingly, most Web3 games are free-to-play, but a significant portion requires players to hold specific NFTs to access the game​​. Furthermore, blockchain networks targeting the gaming sector are expanding despite market challenges. In 2023 alone, the announcement of over 81 new blockchain networks focusing on gaming indicated a 40% year-over-year growth. Developers primarily build the majority of web3 games on general-use L1 networks like Ethereum. However, there’s a rising interest in L2 and L3 solutions, particularly in Optimism’s L2/L3 networks. The Play To Earn Model In Web3 Gaming The Play to Earn (P2E) model is a revolutionary concept in Web3 gaming that intertwines gaming achievements with real-world economic incentives. This model not only enhances player engagement but also creates a new avenue for income generation through gaming. Understanding Web3 Play To Earn Games Play to Earn games in the Web3 space enable players to earn digital assets or cryptocurrencies as rewards for gameplay and achievements. These rewards often come in the form of NFTs or native game tokens. The P2E model capitalizes on blockchain technology to authenticate and secure these transactions, ensuring transparent and fair distribution of rewards. This model has opened up new opportunities for players, particularly in regions with limited access to traditional financial systems, by providing a platform where their gaming skills and strategies can translate into tangible economic benefits. Popular Play To Earn Web3 Games Several games have successfully implemented the P2E model, gaining popularity and a dedicated player base. Notable examples include: Axie Infinity: In its vibrant ecosystem with engaging gameplay, players breed, raise, and battle fantasy creatures called Axies, earning tokens that they can trade or sell. Decentraland: Players can create and monetize content and applications in this virtual world, earning cryptocurrency for their creations and land transactions. The Sandbox: This user-generated content platform allows players to create, own, and monetize gaming experiences using SAND, the platform’s native token. Alien Worlds: An NFT DeFi metaverse where players can mine and battle for Trilium (TLM), the native token, and collect unique NFTs. Splinterlands: A digital collectible card game where players earn rewards based on their gameplay and the rarity of the cards they collect. These games have popularized the Play-to-Earn (P2E) model and demonstrated its creative integration into various gaming genres and platforms. They offer varied and engaging experiences to players while providing economic incentives.

The company reported its Q3 results with Bitcoin production up 121% y/y, while adjusted EBITDA surged by 222%. Following a sharp selloff in recent months, the stock appears undervalued relative to industry peers. We are bullish on Bitcoin and see Bitdeer as well-positioned to rally higher. Bitdeer Technologies Group ( BTDR ) is one of the world's largest publicly traded Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining companies with a last reported hash rate of 21.2 EH/s between its self-mining operation and hosting services. That's an envious position considering the price of BTC has surged this year, currently trading above $40,000 and at the highest level since early 2022. That being said, shares of BTDR have disappointed, losing nearly a third of its value since the company's April SPAC merger IPO . One explanation for this apparent divergence compared to the strength of the broader crypto sector could be related to the end of the stock's six-month post-IPO lock-up timing assuming some early insiders have added to the selling pressure. Taking a closer look, we sense that this sharp selloff from Q2 highs is likely unjustified resulting in the stock becoming undervalued. While Bitcoin mining remains in a speculative corner of the market, Bitdeer is generating some impressive results we believe can continue. We are bullish on the stock and see room for shares to rally alongside the momentum in BTC. Data by YCharts BTDR Financials Recap BTDR reported a Q3 GAAP EPS loss of -$0.02, narrowing from -$0.20 in the period last year. More favorably, the adjusted profit of $10.5 million, reversed a loss of -$4.1 million in the period last year. Revenue of $87.3 million climbed by 14% year-over-year, reflecting a 64% increase in the total hash rate under management. The company mined 1,085 BTC in Q3 considering only the self-mining, more than double the 490 last year. source: company IR The reconciliation here considers what has been an ongoing shift in the business with self-mining playing a bigger role at the top line while the higher margin ""cloud hash rate"" service, has lost some momentum. In this case, the company offers a subscription plan where customers can contract the hash rate for a fee. The demand there has slowed with the climbing network difficulty essentially making the product less appealing relative to self-mining. The bigger takeaway is that Bitdeer has still managed to capitalize on the rising price of Bitcoin while expanding the overall operation. Q3 adjusted EBITDA at $28.0 million, climbed by 222% from $8.7 million in Q3 2022. source: company IR In terms of operational updates , the company's newest Bhutan-based ""Gedu facility"" with 100MW electrical capacity and 3.3EH/s hash rate went online in August. From the current 895MW of global data center electrical capacity, the plan is to reach 2,024MW by 2025 through the expansion of existing facilities in addition to building-out of a new location in the state of Ohio. For reference, Bitdeer's largest active site is the 563MW Rockdale, Texas facility. Notably, the company has announced it has been selected as a Preferred Cloud Service Provider by Nvidia Inc ( NVDA ) to utilize the latest DGX SuperPod with DGX H100 cloud systems for its cloud hash rate mining service in Asia through a new ""Bitdeer AI cloud"" initiative. The expectation here is that this could help revitalize that side of the business going forward while leveraging its existing infrastructure. source: company IR Finally, we can bring up Bitdeer's balance sheet as another strong point in the company's investment profile. The company ended Q3 with $134.5 million in cash against just $22.6 million in long-term debt. There is also an active $2.0 million share-repurchasing program authorized through April 2024. While this amount is marginal against the company's current $550 million market capitalization, we believe it serves as a signal to the board of directors' view that the stock is undervalued at the current level. Is BTDR Undervalued? We mentioned that Bitdeer is among the largest publicly traded commercial miners in the world by hash rate. That was a point reiterated by management citing its total hash rate capacity with data from Q2. The caveat here is that not all the Bitcoin mining companies are directly comparable. In the case of category leader Marathon Digital Inc ( MARA ), for example, the company's 23.1 EH/s hash rate is entirely directed at self-mining. Other companies like Riot Platforms Inc ( RIOT ) take a more vertically integrated approach and own the power infrastructure by generating electricity through company-owned power plants. These factors play into varying levels of earnings potential and growth outlook. The other consideration here is that Bitdeer is a Singapore-based company. While this is not necessarily a problem, it appears the market places a valuation premium on U.S. and Canadian-incorporated miners. source: company IR We bring all this up because the weakness in shares of Bitdeer, down by 60% in the last three months, has been something of a puzzle next to the stronger performance of these same Bitcoin mining peers. We speculated on the timing of the post-SPAC-merger IPO lock-up period. It could be related to the market's implicit verdict on Bitdeer's specific strategy. The truth is that there simply isn't one specific catalyst. What we do know is that the business and infrastructure are real, and the company is benefiting from the same climb in the price of Bitcoin as everyone else. Data by YCharts We can also say that BTDR is trading at a 1.2x EV to consensus 2023 revenue multiple is heavily discounted compared to the peer group that has an average multiple closer to 6x. source: yCharts That wide valuation spread also extends to the EV to forward EBITDA multiple where BTDR appears ""cheap"" trading at 4.3x compared to 11.5x for Bitfarms Inc ( BITF ) and particularly RIOT at 31x from this same measure. Again, there are many moving parts here, and we can cite reasons why some of these stocks are at a premium including their higher hash rate growth deployments. Nevertheless, we believe there is room for those valuation spreads to at least narrow. Data by YCharts BTDR Benefits As BTC Climbs The bullish case for Bitdeer is that the price of Bitcoin continues climbing, as a runway for its mining operation to grow profitably. We've been bullish on BTC with a view that the cryptocurrency has gained institutional acceptance as a credible and legitimate alternative asset that is here to stay. The capped supply of 21 million Bitcoin drives intrinsic value based on its scarcity. The setup now is an environment of building momentum capturing macro trends between a weakening U.S. Dollar, and the pullback in interest rates, with overall renewed bullish sentiment. source: finviz On the other hand, there are lingering uncertainties in this market that represent real risks. For Bitdeer as a mining company, an open question is how the operation will evolve beyond the looming Bitcoin halving set for Q2 2024, where the value of the Bitcoin network reward will essentially be cut in half. The company will need to at least double its production level through the addition of new hash rate capacity to maintain a level of implied revenue considering a constant price of BTC. It's also unclear how the network difficulty will progress through the halving which could introduce some volatility to results over the next several quarters. If anything, one criticism of Bitdeer is that the company may not be aggressive enough in its announced expansion plans. We can also cite the regulatory backdrop as a risk to consider. Bitdeer with its operations spanning three continents and multiple states in the U.S. is subject to different jurisdictions that may be less welcoming to Bitcoin mining in the future. There is also the possibility that the price of Bitcoin simply reverses lower for any number of reasons. Putting it all together, we believe the next big move for BTDR is higher. We rate BTDR as a buy on the basis that the stock appears underpriced relative to its industry peers and the extreme volatility in recent months was unjustified. Final Thoughts Bitdeer isn't perfect but we think there are enough strong points in its outlook and like the setup particularly considering the bullish trading action in the price of Bitcoin. Over the next few quarters, the monitoring points include the monthly production level updates while we also believe margins and cash flow trends should be closely followed.

Its price has risen over 300% in a 30-day period, and this has brought its market cap back over $1.5 billion once more. As the coin continues to outperform, the possibilities of it returning to its previous all-time high market cap become greater. LUNC Price Breaks One-Year High Following the Terra collapse in 2022, the LUNC (then known as LUNA) price crashed completely, going from above $100 to less than $0. This has continued through the last year especially as the LUNC supply has swelled to over 6.5 trillion. Related Reading: AVAX Uprising: Crypto Analyst Predicts Bullish Wave To Push Price To $30 As the price has plunged, so has the market cap. But with the recovery in price so far, the jump in market cap has come as no surprise. However, it is still a long way from its all-time high market cap of $45 billion which was reached back in 2021. Now, if LUNC were to return to this all-time high market cap once more, it would be a significant increase from its current price. But it will still be a long way from its ATH price of $$120. At a market cap of $40 billion, the price of the altcoin would be just around $0.007. This would mean a more than 10x increase from its current price. However, it’ll still be very low compared to its previous price as well as the price of the new LUNA token which was launched in 2023 and is already trading above $1. Token price breaks $0.0002 | Source: LUNCUSDT on Tradingview.com Can Terra Classic Break Previous ATH? The LUNC community has implemented a burn initiative to reduce the amount of tokens in circulation. This has seen billions of tokens taken out of circulation in less than a year. Data from the LuncMetrics website shows that so far, 83.77 billion tokens have been burned since the burn initiative was introduced in 2022. However, this is only a drop in the ocean of the total token supply which numbers in the trillions. Related Reading: 3 Bitcoin-Like Proof Of Work Altcoins That Could Make You A Millionaire In 2024 Nevertheless, the community continues to burn tokens in a bid to drastically reduce the circulating supply. In the last seven days, a little over 5.2 billion LUNC tokens have been sent to the burn address, reducing the supply little by little. The LUNC price is already far from returning to its past glory, but there is still a lot ahead for the coin. If it continues to perform well in the bull market, a return to the $0.01 level is a possibility. As the crypto industry grows, the likelihood of top coins crossing the $100 billion market cap becomes even more likely, signaling a better future for the altcoin.

42419045,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDQKb,1701728497,"Bitcoin Rally to $42K Fueled by 'Panic Buying,' Pushes Crypto Market Cap Over $1.5T","Bitcoin hit a fresh yearly high of $42,000, pushing the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies over $1.5 trillion for the first since May 2022.  Bets on lower interest rates, spot bitcoin ETF anticipation and ""panic buying"" helped the rally, analysts said.  Bitcoin [BTC] hit a fresh 19-month high above $42,000 Monday, fueled by some ""panic buying"" as expectations for lower interest rates, looming spot bitcoin ETF decisions and flows into digital asset funds supported rising crypto prices.  The largest crypto asset by market capitalization moved quickly over the weekend after it cleared significant resistance at $38,000, a level that capped prices for the most part of November.  BTC late Monday afternoon was holding right around $42,000, up 5.8% over the past 24 hours.  Smaller tokens lagged behind, with ether [ETH], BNB and ADA gaining 2%-3% during the day, while XRP traded flat. The CoinDesk Market Index [CMI] – which tracks the performance of some 200 cryptos – was up 4.2%.  Bitcoin's rise pushed the total crypto market value to over $1.5 trillion for the first time since May 2022, when Terra's collapse marked the beginning of the crypto winter, TradingView data shows.  Why bitcoin rallied  Bitcoin's rise is still dominated by anticipation for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S., with market observers overwhelmingly expecting an approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in early January.  See more: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Could See Inflows of $14.4B in First Year, Galaxy Says  Crypto investment services provider Matrixport noted in a Monday report the elevated levels of bitcoin perpetual futures premium versus the spot price, suggesting that traders rushed into BTC driven by fear of missing out – or FOMO – of the rally.  ""Traders do not have enough upside leverage, this is the conclusion from the elevated premium that perpetual futures are trading at,"" the report said. Perpetual futures traded at around 5-10% premium versus the spot price for most of the year, which widened to 10-15%, with sometimes hitting 20-30%, the report explained.  ""This shows panic buying from traders who are closing out shorts or increasing leveraged longs,"" Matrixport analysts said.  Investors show no sign of stopping throwing money into crypto funds, according to the lastest fund flows report from asset manager CoinShares. Last week saw another $172 million of net inflows, bringing the inflow winning streak to 10 weeks and $1.7 billion.  The macroeconomic environment also supports bitcoin's price rise. ""Dovish talk from some Fed officials, a weakening dollar, and relatively sturdy domestic data helped propel markets over the weekend,"" Alex Thorn, head of research at digital asset investment firm Galaxy, said in an email.  Market participants increasingly bet on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates next year, putting an 86% probability of lower Fed funds rate by May, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.  Reasons for caution ahead  While bitcoin's outlook looks bright, there are some possible short-term headwinds looming, analysts said.  ""The reason for concern is that even though selling pressure was being exhausted in the futures markets, there was a lack of follow-through from spot markets,"" Bitfinex analysts said in a Monday report.  ""The reason could be multifold, including short-term investors still anticipating lower prices being caught off-guard and now waiting for confirmation before entering long positions or simply interest from smaller market participants being driven towards higher returns on altcoins,"" the report added.  Another reason for caution is that some 85% of bitcoin addresses are sitting in profits, Galaxy's Thorn noted, so ""further moves higher could see profit taking.""  ""Despite the run, bitcoin remains very constructive,"" Thorn said with overhangs reducing (bad actors exiting, bankruptcies resolving), catalysts on the horizon (spot ETFs, halving), holders remaining firm, a constructive macro environment, and institutional engagement still mostly on the sidelines.""  ""BTC is up more than 150% year-to-date, and it is one of the world’s best-performing assets on a risk-adjusted basis,"" he said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/04/bitcoin-rally-to-42k-fueled-by-panic-buying-pushes-crypto-market-cap-over-15t,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/48b56a55d41c66e2841f8f3f2b4b55d8b682a87f-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin To $60,000 In Progress? According to Mike Alfred, who claims to be a value investor and a board director, the market will “unlikely” allow BlackRock to purchase BTC below $60,000. Taking to X on December 4, Alfred said BlackRock and other Wall Street players keen on issuing spot Bitcoin ETFs would have to “buy for Boomer’s 401k plans for at least $60,000.” This preview stems from the rapidly growing demand among institutional investors, as seen by the number of Wall Street players willing to issue complex derivatives tailored for, among other investors, “baby boomers,” most of whom are “approaching retirement.” With their substantial retirement savings, baby boomers increasingly recognize BTC’s potential as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. Related Reading: ADA In The Spotlight: Heavyweight Investors Pile Into Cardano, What’s Next? Following Federal Reserve intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation rose to multi-year levels in 2021. To preserve purchasing power, the central bank began hiking interest rates. Although inflation has fallen and the economy stabilized, it remains higher than the target of 2%. The Fed continues to track this metric and may further intervene by raising rates to lower inflation. This might impact Bitcoin prices, as seen in the past months. Nonetheless, the potential influx of boomer money into Bitcoin via a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approved derivatives product is a big boost for the coin. Though the SEC has yet to authorize multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs, the crypto and Bitcoin market expects the strict regulator to greenlight the first product in the next few weeks. BlackRock And Company To Buy BTC At A Premium Accordingly, ahead of this milestone development for the Bitcoin and crypto market, Alfred thinks BlackRock, Fidelity, and other players won’t secure Bitcoin at spot rates. Instead, the market anticipates that BlackRock, one of the world’s largest digital asset managers, will make their “bi-weekly purchases at prices above $60,000.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Cycle Analysis And Macro Factors Reveal When Price Will Reach $125,000 The coin is trading at April 2022 levels, ripping above $40,000 over the weekend as bulls step up. Looking at the BTC candlestick arrangement on the daily chart, the first clear resistance is around $48,000. The coin trades within a bullish breakout formation following gains above $32,000. As buyers step up and investors anticipate the SEC approving the first batch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the coin will likely continue increasing toward all-time highs of around $70,000.

Standing tall among these challengers is Solana, celebrated for its exceptional throughput and scalability. In a recent turn of events, Solana’s DeFi ecosystem has etched a momentous milestone, thrusting itself into the dynamic DeFi landscape. The surge in Total Value Locked (TVL) to an impressive $655 million signals a watershed moment, underpinned by the escalating interest and unwavering confidence in Solana’s prowess within the DeFi sector. Related Reading: Ethereum Breaks Through $2,200 Ceiling, Investors Expect $3,000 This Week Solana TVL Skyrockets: A Decisive Leap In The DeFi Landscape This surge not only marks a numerical achievement but also underscores the burgeoning significance of Solana as a formidable player in the evolving narrative of decentralized finance. As of October 1st, DefiLlama’s statistics showed that Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) was around $326 million. Nevertheless, further examination revealed a significant increase in TVL by the end of October. SOL TVL. Source: DefiLlama The TVL has soared to over $655 million as of the most recent release, demonstrating an amazing doubling from the October data. It’s not quite at its historical apex, but this increase is the highest TVL in more than a year, indicating a strong and steady growth trend. The most recent numbers indicate a significant growth of almost 200% from Solana’s January 1st $211 million TVL. Solana’s TVL had a sharp decline following the collapse of FTX, falling from just over $10 billion in November 2021 to a low of $210 million in January 2023. SOLUSD currently trading at $61.18 on the daily chart: TradingView.com With this increase, Solana is leading the way in the expansion of decentralized finance. SOL, in particular, beat out the competition and took back Avalanche’s (AVAX) seventh rank with $678.7 million locked up and put to use in its processes. Solana’s Surge: Key Growth Factors There are a number of important reasons that have contributed to Solana’s growth and revival. The demand for Solana-based products, such Ordinals’ “SolScriptions” and other meme coins, has spurred demand and increased token minting on the Solana network. Solana TVL in DeFi chains. Source: DefiLlama Active involvement in liquid staking protocols such as Jito and Marinade Finance has further enhanced the network’s appeal by drawing in new users and improving liquidity. In addition, Solana’s network saw an increase in daily addresses; as of press time, there were 158,000 daily addresses. All of these measures point to increased network traffic. Related Reading: ORDI Shatters Records With New All-Time High In Bullish Surge Not only is Solana’s notable expansion in the DeFi area a testament to the platform’s success, but it also serves as a barometer of the dynamic blockchain environment. It signals a change in the direction of more effective, scalable technology, upending the dominance of established platforms. According to statistics from cryptocurrency market price tracker Coingecko, SOL was trading at $61.94 at the time of writing, up 12% over the previous seven days. As the TVL more than doubles in recent times, attention turns to the potential impact on SOL’s valuation. The dynamic interplay between Solana’s TVL milestones and its cryptocurrency’s price sets the stage for an intriguing narrative in the crypto landscape.

21054567,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563779,1701720041,"Shiba Inu Open Interest Falls Behind General Crypto Market, What This Means For Price","The entire crypto market has seen a steady increase in open interest (OI) over the last few months. But the Shiba Inu open interest seems to not have followed this trend as much as others. While there has been a huge jump in the open interest of the largest cryptocurrencies in the industry, Shiba Inu’s rise has remained relatively muted, with implications for the altcoin’s price. Shiba Inu Open Interest Trajectory The Shiba Inu open interest initially started pumping back in August when the current bull run began. However, in the following months, the open interest has been considerably lower, happening at a time when open interest across other top cryptocurrencies is seeing large spikes. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Bitcoin 400% Surge To $200,000, Here’s When Shiba Inu’s open interest crossed $43 million back in August but has had a hard time returning to this level, data from Coinglass shows. The open interest has since dropped and continues to range just below the $20 million level. Now, while this is not out of character for the altcoin, it is a deviation when it comes to following Bitcoin’s trends. Dogecoin, SHIB’s foremost competitor, has followed the trajectory of Bitcoin, with the open interest staying low through the months of October and then exploding in the month of November. To put this in perspective, the Dogecoin open interest dropped as low as $226 million in October before exploding as high as $520 million in November. However, the Shiba Inu open interest has struggled, maintaining a low peak of $17 million in November with a small rise to $18 million in December. This is in stark contrast to the open interest of Bitcoin and Dogecoin which have seen a flurry of activities as prices have recovered. SHIB price shows more volatility | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com SHIB OI Deviates From Price Another way that Shiba Inu has deviated from the rest of the crypto market is the fact that the price does not move directly proportional to the open interest. While the likes of Bitcoin and Dogecoin have shown prices moving upward as open interest has soared, SHIB’s price has remained fairly high while the open interest has remained fairly low. Related Reading: The Big Move: Crypto Pundit Predicts When Bitcoin Will Reach A New ATH This suggests that a rise in open interest is not actually one of the major factors pushing the SHIB price. So unlike others, a crash in open interest will likely not translate into a crash in price. However, Shiba Inu continues to trail the Bitcoin recovery closely, so a decline in the BTC price could sorely affect the SHIB price.

The analyst has cited data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock to explain this, referring to the on-chain acquisition distribution of the cryptocurrency. The data for the cost basis distribution of the asset | Source: @ali_charts on X In the above graph, the dots represent the number of investors or addresses who bought their coins within the corresponding price range. Naturally, the larger the size of the dot, the more is the density of holders who bought inside the range. It appears that out of all the price ranges that ETH has visited in its entire history, the $1,900 to $2,100 one hosts the cost basis of the largest number of holders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Triumphs Over $41,000, But Here’s What Could Prevent $50,000 ETH was just recently consolidating inside this range, and as trading occurred inside it, the investors slowly gained their cost basis there, which is why the range has now swelled so large. Now, what relevance does this range have for Ethereum? To understand this, how investor psychology works must first be known. To any investor, their cost basis is a particular price level, as their profit-loss situation can flip when the asset’s spot price retests it. Because of this reason, the holder might be more likely to show some kind of move when this retest takes place. If the investor had last been in profits, they might expect the same level to be profitable again, so they may just buy more. A few investors doing such buying won’t make the market budge at all, but if a large number of investors bought inside the same tight range, the levels might just end up providing support to Ethereum should it make a retest. The $1,900 to $2,100 buyers are obviously in profits, so this range, which hosts the cost basis of 5.85 million addresses who acquired 43.8 million ETH there, could show a major buying reaction if ETH dips towards it. Ali explains, “this range could become a significant support level for years ahead. So, it’s not too late to get in on ETH!” Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Bitcoin 400% Surge To $200,000, Here’s When In another post yesterday, the same analyst had posted the Ethereum weekly chart, noting that if ETH could secure a sustained candle close above the $2,150 mark, the asset could be set for some exciting uptrend.

21051158,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563832,1701712810,"ADA In The Spotlight: Heavyweight Investors Pile Into Cardano, What’s Next?","Cardano (ADA) has recently caught the attention of large-scale investors, also known as ‘whales.’ Crypto analyst Ali, leveraging on-chain data, has observed a significant uptick in large ADA transactions, typically over $100,000, in the past three months. Ali noted that this growing trend suggests a heightened interest from institutional players and high-net-worth individuals in ADA. The analyst further disclosed that such whale activities have often been precursors of imminent price movements. #Cardano | In the last three months, there’s been a significant increase in $ADA transactions over $100,000, reaching new highs consistently. This surge points to growing interest in #ADA from institutional players and whales, which is usually a precursor to price spikes. pic.twitter.com/APczM2PGxM — Ali (@ali_charts) December 4, 2023 Notably, while transactions can significantly impact a crypto’s market dynamics, when whales accumulate an asset, it often reduces circulating supply, creating potential upward pressure on prices. Conversely, when they sell, it can result in a sudden increase in supply, leading to price drops. In ADA’s case, the recent whale activities have coincided with a positive price trajectory. ADA Bullish Trajectory And Market Outlook ADA’s market performance has mirrored the growing whale interest. In the last 24 hours alone, the crypto asset has experienced a 2.2% increase, and over 5% in the past week. Although ADA has seen some retracement from its recently achieved peak above the $0.41 mark, it currently maintains a steady position in the $0.40 zone. This bullish trend is further supported by a surge in ADA’s trading volume, which has doubled from $250 million to over $500 million in a week. This increase in trading activity and price aligns with the predictions of another analyst, Dan Gambardello. Gambardello has identified bullish setups in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and ADA, projecting that ADA could climb to $0.45 in the short term, with a longer-term target of $0.80-$0.85. The analyst attributes his optimistic forecast to the growth and resilience of the Cardano ecosystem, even amid the recent broader market’s bearish trends. GROUNDBREAKING MOMENT: Bitcoin, Cardano, Ethereum Setup For BULL MARKET https://t.co/cPfZzIVCxh — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) December 4, 2023 Recent data from DeFiLlama reveals a notable uptick in Cardano’s ecosystem, with its Total Value Locked (TVL) experiencing over 20% growth in the past month, currently standing at $275 million. Although this figure is below its March 2022 peak of over $300 million, the ecosystem’s approach toward this previous high point reflects its resilience, as indicated by Gambardello amid the recent bearish market sentiments. Cardano’s Ecosystem: A Catalyst For Future Growth? Gambardello’s enthusiasm for Cardano extends beyond its current market performance. The analyst believes that the Cardano ecosystem’s development during the bear cycle positions it for significant growth in the future. Gambardello predicts that Cardano could soon account for 1% of the total crypto market capitalization. Such a milestone would be a testament to the asset’s ecosystem robustness and innovation, potentially leading to ADA’s substantial rise in the next bull run. Notably, Gambardello isn’t the only analyst predicting a bullish future for ADA. In a recent post on X, Ali highlighted ADA’s presence in a crucial demand zone. The analyst pointed out that the price levels around $0.37 to $0.38 have seen substantial buying activity, with over 166,470 wallets acquiring ADA in this range. #Cardano sits at a key demand zone between $0.37 and $0.38. Here, 166,470 wallets acquired 4.88 billion $ADA. With minimal resistance ahead and solid support below, remaining above this zone could pave the way for $ADA to climb to new yearly highs. Still, watch out, as losing… pic.twitter.com/GDjhspFSVr — Ali (@ali_charts) November 27, 2023 Ali interprets this strong buying interest as an indication of a solid support level for ADA. According to his analysis, ADA is poised for an uptrend with little resistance ahead, potentially exceeding its yearly high of $0.4518. Related Reading: On The Brink Of Breakthrough? Analyst Foresees Cardano (ADA) Hitting New Annual Heights Despite ADA recently surpassing and seemingly respecting these key demand zones, its price has only reached a peak of $0.41 so far, not quite breaching the $0.45 mark.

42419030,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDQ69,1701711001,"Tokenization of RWAs Gets Push in Europe as AXA, Generali Buys SocGen's Green Bonds on Ethereum","French banking giant Societe Generale completed its first tokenized green bond issuance on the Ethereum network as tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) is rising in demand among traditional financial institutions.  SocGen issued €10 million ($10.8 million) worth of digital green bond tokens, registered by SG-FORGE, the bank's digital asset-focused arm, the firm said Monday in a press release. Traditional finance institutions AXA Investment Managers (AXA IM) and Generali Investments purchased the tokenized bonds.  The bank will use the net proceeds of the bond sale to finance or refinance sustainable activities.  The issuance underscores traditional financial (TradFi) institutions' growing appetite for using blockchain-based technologies, including tokenization and stablecoins. Last month, JPMorgan and Apollo made headlines by demonstrating with a handful of crypto firms how asset managers could tokenize funds on the blockchain. Tokenization means placing assets like bonds, credit or real estate to blockchains in the form of a token.  Investment management firm 21.co forecasted that the market value of tokenized assets could reach $10 trillion as more RWAs migrate to blockchain plumbing.  The digital format of the issued bonds provides greater transparency and traceability as well as speedier transactions and settlements, according to the bank.  The bond issuance was ""also a first step towards using blockchain as a data repository and certification tool for issuers and investors to foster transparency on ESG and impact data on a global scale,"" SocGen said.  AXA IM, which is the asset management arm of French insurance giant AXA purchased €5 million worth of bonds on behalf of AXA France using the euro-pegged stablecoin EURCV helmed by SG-FORGE as part of a joint blockchain experiment, the company said in a separate press release Monday.

42419049,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDQNh,1701710461,Most Influential 2023,"It was a year of retrenchment and transition for the crypto industry. After 2022’s scandals, including FTX, Three Arrows and Celsius, asset prices had gotten crushed and the industry was in hunker-down mode: building, retooling, sharpening up compliance. Regulators went on a warpath, launching major investigations against Coinbase, Binance, Kraken and others. Long-standing, and potentially momentous, legal cases, like Ripple’s with the SEC over the sale of XRP, reached a conclusion.  THIS POST IS PART OF COINDESK'S MOST INFLUENTIAL 2023. SEE THE FULL LIST HERE.  By year-end, the industry’s prospects seemed more clear. Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty of massive securities fraud in November and everyone, proponents and critics alike, was ready to move on. The industry had hopes for greater regulatory clarity going forward, with several bills on Congress’s agenda and MiCA’s comprehensive legislation going into force in Europe, covering 450 million users.  At the time of writing, bitcoin [BTC] has more than doubled in price since this time last year and many other cryptocurrencies are rising, too. TradFi is looking at digital assets ever more seriously, getting involved with staking and the tokenization of real-world assets as never before. With spot bitcoin ETFs likely to be approved early next year, millions more people are set to join crypto markets and the industry has finally, properly, joined the mainstream.  CoinDesk’s “Most Influential” package tells the story of the year in crypto, profiling 50 people we think define the main stories and themes. It features a lot of names from regulation, lawmaking and policy-advocacy, as you would expect. SEC Chair Gary Gensler is in our top 10, for instance, as is Ryan Selkis, the Messari CEO who became a leading advocate for crypto in Washington, D.C., this year.  Also in the top 10 are Casey Rodarmor, the creator of the controversial Ordinals Theory, which brings data inscription (and digital collectibles) to Bitcoin; Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who launched the Base layer 2 and moved strongly in derivatives; and Jose Fernandez da Ponte, who led fintech powerhouse PayPal's initiative for its own Ethereum-based U.S. dollar stablecoin. Similarly, Paolo Ardoino, the new Tether CEO, gets a nod for his resilience in leading arguably the most successful crypto (after bitcoin), despite criticism of its stablecoin business.  The rest of the list includes names from across the wide range of industry sub-sectors, from NFTs and DeFi to hardware and central bank digital currencies. The list is a mix of familiar names (like Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier) and new faces from TradFi, reflecting the increasing convergence of the two. Larry Fink, the BlackRock CEO and chairman who once dismissed bitcoin, gets a mention because his company is now looking to launch a bitcoin ETF along with other major names from Wall Street. Also honored, last but so not least, is CoinDesk’s own Ian Allison, who broke the story of Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research’s dodgy balance sheet, setting off the collapse of FTX and SBF's trial that culminated (jaw-droppingly) in November. If nobody believed it before, journalists were influencers in crypto this year.  CoinDesk asked 10 leading artists to create 10 pieces of original artwork for the series. These pieces will now be available as NFTs during an auction set to begin after 12 p.m. ET (17:00 UTC) on Dec. 4. It will run for 24 hours following the execution of the first bid on Transient Labs’ sales platform. Part of the proceeds from the NFTs will go to The Hunger Project, a New York non-profit that works to reduce hunger around the world. Check out all the art here and make your bid. It’s the 10th year CoinDesk has been proud to publish its “Most Influential” list, our annual appraisal of what moved on crypto that year. Looking back, many names from earlier years are still prominent (Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has made three appearances on the list as has prominent crypto intellectual Balaji Srinivasan). Names like Blythe Masters, Theymos and Adam Ludwin, who were honored in 2015 and 2016, are less prominent these days.  We’re aware that a list like this won’t please everyone. There are many names who might have deserved to be on this year’s roster and aren’t – for which we are sorry. Most Influential is meant, above all, to represent industry trends and themes (and the people associated with those themes). It can never be comprehensive in actually tracking brute influence! It’s meant more as a snapshot, and it’s definitely not a ranking. Outside of picking the top 10, we don’t order the names; they appear randomly, more or less.  We hope you enjoy the profiles and artwork here and that you will offer feedback on the choices we made. Please do check out the NFTs and make a bid: the artists and the Hunger Project will appreciate your generosity.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/introducing-most-influential-2023,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3a66eb5a8ab68d88479df903785acbfa6322f7e6-300x300.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At its lowest during the bear market of 2022, bitcoin had pulled back to under $16,000, putting MicroStrategy's bet deep in the red. Saylor, however, continued to add to the company's holdings, funding purchases with a mixture of debt and equity issuance.  Microstrategy (MSTR) shares were trading around 6% higher on Monday.

21049437,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563778,1701709239,"Bitcoin Cycle Analysis And Macro Factors Reveal When Price Will Reach $125,000","Crypto financial services firm Matrixport has reaffirmed its bullish projection on the future trajectory of the Bitcoin price. While at it, the firm also mentioned when this is likely to happen based on past cycles and historical performance. When Bitcoin Will Hit $125,000 In a report that dwelled on the sustainability of the bull market in 2024, Matrixport mentioned that Bitcoin will hit $125,000 by the end of 2024. Before then, they project that Bitcoin will hit $63,140 by April 2024. April 2024 is scheduled to be when the Bitcoin Halving will take place and this event is expected by many to kickstart the bull market. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Rallies To 4-Month Highs – Can Bulls Take It Above $0.3? The basis for their $125,000 projection stems from the fact that the years in which Bitcoin Halving took place are generally bullish. Historically, Bitcoin saw a 186%, %126, and 297% gain in 2012, 2016, and 2020 respectively. As such, they expect that something similar will happen in 2024. Another point that they used to back up their projection is the fact that miners tend to hoard their Bitcoin rewards before each halving. There is usually a significant price increase after the event (about 200%). Therefore, they expect that this time won’t be different, with Bitcoin able to hit the $125,000 price level if that happens. Meanwhile, the macro factors seem to be aligning for this parabolic rally in 2024. Based on Matrixport’s inflation model, there could be a decline in inflation, which could lead to a cool-off in the hike of interest rates. If that happens, it would undoubtedly be bullish for Bitcoin, considering that the Fed’s hawkish stance has been known to affect Bitcoin’s price. BTC price still holding above $41,000 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com The Bull Market Already Began Contrary to public opinion, Matrixport believes that the bull market already began this year. They noted that, just as in past cycles, the bull market has always lasted for three years after every bear market. Based on this “simple cycle analysis,” they project that this bull market will also last for three years. Going by this assumption, the bull market will run until 2025. Related Reading: XRP Price Set To Explode: Analyst Identifies Trigger For Next Parabolic Move The financial services firm had previously shared a report on how the fifth bull market will unfold. This cycle, which they assert began on June 22, 2023, has been said to be likely driven by expectations of institutional adoption. This is likely a reference to the Spot Bitcoin ETFs that could potentially launch soon. Their projections so far seem to be on track. As part of how this bull market will unfold, they had affirmed that Bitcoin will hit $45,000 between November this year and April 2024. That could happen sooner than later, as the flagship cryptocurrency recently broke above $40,000.

The cryptocurrency stands closer to the $50,000 area as 2023 ends, and two major bullish catalyzers stand on the horizon. Related Reading: Bitcoin Triumphs Over $41,000, But Here’s What Could Prevent $50,000 As of this writing, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $41,800 with a 6% profit in the last 24 hours. In the previous seven days, BTC recorded an impressive 13% rally as analysts and the crypto community celebrated the beginning of a new bull cycle. Bitcoin Whales Behind $40,000 Rally, Are More Profits In Store? Data provided by Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto analysis firm CryptoQuant, indicates that Bitcoin whales have supported the current price action since August. At that time, the cryptocurrency re-took the higher area at $20,000 and stood below the critical resistance at $30,000. As Bitcoin trended to the upside, whales took on “giga long positions” potentially in preparation for the current rally. This risk-on behavior began more discretely when BTC touched $16,000. Young Ju tied the market activity to increased buying orders from US investors. On Coinbase, the price of Bitcoin “skyrocketed” in October 2023. Investors in the country have been buying more of the cryptocurrency in preparation for the spot BTC Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) approval and the Halving event. The latter of this event is the reduction of the rewards for mining BTC. Furthermore, the CryptoQuant CEO believes retail investors have yet to board the rally. As seen in the chart below, BTC’s Realized Cap stood below 0.1, indicating “low liquidity” from retail investors in the crypto market. Game Is Not Over For BTC Additional data provided by Material Indicators confirmed the increasing buying pressure from whales. Analyst Keith Alan claimed that this behavior occurs to attract liquidity to the market. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Bitcoin 400% Surge To $200,000, Here’s When Once liquidity, mostly from retail investors, enters the market, whales can “distribute” their coins or “dump” on retail to take profit from their position.

Crypto Analyst On The Bitcoin Rally Dan Gambardello took to his official X (formerly Twitter) handle to share his bullish about the three major cryptocurrencies. The analyst post was accompanied by a video where he explained why he is bullish on these three coins. According to the analyst, positive setups have appeared on the charts of all three cryptocurrencies. At the beginning of the video, Gambardello stated that he believes Bitcoin has a short-term upside target of about $42,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Blasts Past $41,500: Here Are The Reasons But regardless of whether the market leader hits this threshold, he believes there might be a correction. His warning of a correction is due to the overbought territory the crypto asset has entered. Additionally, he revealed that the impending correction of BTC would resemble past price movements. He further asserted that the asset would make this adjustment a “common move.” The analyst also discussed the potential for Bitcoin to consolidate near the $42,000 resistance level. According to the analyst, it would signal the beginning of a new phase for the market when it takes place. Gambardello also expressed his confidence about the next bull run, believing it to be imminent. He noted that the worst bearish trends for Bitcoin ended in January this year and have played out “quite well” ever since. However, he asserted that crypto market consistency might not have played perfectly, but it has been pretty close to being “accurate” in terms of what the cycles have been doing. He stated: In this macro piece of data I charted in 2018, BTC was like $3,500 or so. And this was my approach to the macrocycles of crypto. And has it played out perfectly? it has not been perfect, but it has been extremely close to on point, in terms of what these cycles are doing. Dan Gambardello On Ethereum (ETH) And Cardano (ADA) Gambardallo believes that the Ethereum trend appears to be different from that of BTC. He highlighted an ascending triangle for the crypto asset, which could see ETH reaching about the $4,000 price mark. He also highlighted a critical resistance level for ETH, around $2,270, on its chart. Related Reading: Here Are Four Crypto Assets Poised For A Major Price Explosion – Analyst So far, he believes ETH could surge to $3,000 if it can break above this level in the next few weeks. However, he further urges the cryptocurrency community to be prepared for a huge crash when this happens. For ADA, the analyst has highlighted an ascending triangle for the asset with quite a few resistance levels. He projected that if ADA breaks out in the coming days, the cryptocurrency would surge to $0.45. Also, his longer-term price stance for ADA is between the $0.80 and $0.85 range.

42419034,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDQBJ,1701699126,Stani Kulechov Defied Crypto Winter,"Stani Kulechov is the founder and CEO of Avara, the software development company behind decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Aave; the stablecoin GHO, which launched this year; and the upstart Web3 social protocol, Lens Protocol, which recently arrived on the Polygon layer 2. The main Aave protocol upgraded to V3 this year, improving user accessibility and introducing security features.  Aave, a DeFi lending platform primarily based on the Ethereum blockchain, lets users take out instant loans denominated in cryptocurrency using other cryptocurrencies they own as collateral. It also allows users to lend out their crypto to earn returns. The smart contract-based system sets rules for how funds, collateral and fees are distributed and assessed, effectively creating a self-executing model of finance with few or no intermediaries.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list,click here.  This isn't an easy time for DeFi players. The total value locked in DeFi protocols is about a quarter ($40 billion) of what it was at the height of the market in November 2021. Kulechov says the last year has been dedicated to building better infrastructure for DeFi, including improved accessibility and user interfaces to increase participation. ""The amount of value, like, it really depends obviously on what's the need, for example, for liquidity,"" Kulechov told CoinDesk. ""It depends on the opportunities in finance and how much there's actually access to participate as well."" In other words, the amount of deposits or ""total value locked"" (TVL) on Aave is a function of the market as much as the performance of the technology itself.  Kulechov was born in 1991 in the former Soviet Republic of Estonia, before his family emigrated to Finland and settled in Helsinki amid the economic crisis that followed the Soviet Union's collapse. In 2015, while at Helsinki University School of Law, he came across Ethereum and started learning about smart contracts. Kulechov built ""ETHLend,"" the precursor to the Aave Protocol, while in his dorm room at the same university. Kulechov now lives in London, where Avara is based.  In 2024, Kulechov expects to see further expansion of staking (which had a breakout year in 2023) and further integration of ""real-world assets"" including tokenized Treasuries and securities. He's also excited about Lens and decentralized social media, which he expects to build slowly but surely as more people turn away from centralized services like Twitter and start to control their own online data. ""There's a lot of social capital that we create in our internet and in real life and Lens helps to preserve that capital in ownership directly for the users,"" he said. ""It's still in the very early stages, but we already have that infrastructure of decentralized social media that is quite significant for our space.""  Finally, Kulechov expects to see more talk of blockchain technology offering verifiability and tracking for artificial intelligence development. ""I think we'll start to see how to govern AI from the perspective of using blockchain as well. I think that's another interesting area that gets less attention from our industry, and could be an interesting tool,"" he said.",POSITIVE,ETH,AAVE | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/stani-kulechov-defied-crypto-winter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ca961897632dc414a861edb49f6e2bab8b89c678-350x350.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

21044353,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563768,1701698446,"Ethereum Turns Deflationary With Over 106,000 ETH Burned In A Single Month","The Ethereum ecosystem is back on track with its mission to ensure that Ether is deflationary following a significant increase in the burn rate. Several factors are said to have contributed to this milestone, including voluntary exits by validators. Over 106,000 ETH Burned In The Last 30 Days According to data from Ultra Sound Money, over 106,000 ETH have been burned in the last 30 days. In that same period, only just over 70,000 ETH have been issued. This has caused a significant decrease in Ethereum’s supply, with it being down by over 35,000 ETH. Related Reading: The Big Move: Crypto Pundit Predicts When Bitcoin Will Reach A New ATH This is a welcome development, as the disparity between the burn and issuance rate hasn’t always been this obvious. That led to concerns as to whether ETH was truly deflationary or not. It also began to seem like the London Hard Fork wasn’t effective. Ahead of the Merge, Ethereum introduced this upgrade in its efforts to make ETH deflationary. ETH investors are sure to be delighted with the fact that the token has once again become deflationary. Such development could propel ETH’s price to new heights. Moreover, it comes at a time when the market is preparing for an imminent bull run. As such, this macro factor, alongside other ones, places it at the forefront to be one of the biggest gainers. ETH price recovers above $2,200 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Factors That Have Contributed To The Ethereum Deflationary Status A report by Glassnode provided insights as to why Ethereum is deflationary once again. One of them happens to be the fact that the number of validators onboarded has slowed in recent weeks. Instead, Ethereum has an increasing number of validators exiting the ecosystem. This development has ultimately caused ETH issuance to slow. This trend of exits notably began at the start of October. This seems to be when investors actually began to take full advantage of the Shanghai upgrade that had taken place in April. Before October, the exiting event is reported to have been at an average of 309 validators per day. That increased to 1018 validators per day at the start of October. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Revenue Sees Massive 6-Month Crash – What’s Going On? Meanwhile, the burn rate during this period is said to have increased significantly due to the growing network activity. The increase in network usage has led to higher gas fees. The daily amount of transaction fees burned through the EIP1559 protocol has also increased as a result. The accumulated fees burned between October and November are reported to have reached 5,368 ETH. Ethereum is flying high at the moment, and this could be partly due to its recently achieved status. At the time of writing, the crypto token is trading at around $2,240, up by over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

AppsFlyer has been providing attribution - the process of determining which marketing techniques are turning into sales - for mobile gaming since 2011, for which it has raised $300 million in venture capital.  Spindl was formed two years ago from the aim to build a Web3-native version of this sort of platform that blockchain-based games can use as a basis for their strategy.  However, this has proved difficult as most ""Web3 games"" are in fact a hybrid of on-chain and off-chain, which is where Spindl needs the functionality provided by AppsFlyer.  The two firms will be integrating their data sets to allow developers to map their user journeys which span Web2 events - like clicks and app installs - and Web3 events like NFT mints, according to a blog shared with CoinDesk on Monday.  Web2 is the current incarnation of the internet built around mobile apps and social media, and Web3 refers to the next incarnation focused on decentralization and built on blockchain technology.  Spindl founder Antonio García Martínez sees the partnership as a sign that Web2 and Web3 gaming are merging.  ""Every Web 3 gaming dashboard has missing data around onchain revenue and user actions, presenting a very partial picture,"" he wrote.

We spoke with Coldie about his work for the question and answer below.  Tell us about how/why you became an artist. Why do you choose to create NFTs?  I began creating art around 2009 after years of being the cover designer at LA Weekly. My fascination has always been surrounding stereoscopic 3D imaging. This originally started as being one of the only 3D concert photographers in the world, shooting my favorite bands live on stage in 3D with a custom-hacked 3D camera I built. In 2017 I found the blockchain and wanted to do my part to help tell the story about it and art was the best medium for me to be involved. In 2018 when I began tokenizing there as no such thing as a ""NFT"" and I still do not relate to that as a term of what I create. I started tokenizing my digitally-native artworks on R.A.R.E. ART LABS and SUPER RARE in 2018 and since then have continued to create and experiement with this new technology. I create art and use the technology of an NFT for provable scarecity, provenance, and worldwide peer-to-peer exchange.  Talk about your artistic approach to creating an image for this year’s Most Influential.  Pascal is the front-facing person that millions of crypto investors trust with the most valuable digital assets they own. The face gives many cues about what might be inside a person's head. I play off these themes in the stereoscopic 3D artwork. The art can be viewed in a variety of 3D methods including anaglyph 3D glasses, 3D TV, 3D tablets, VR and whatever comes in the future. Much as ledger has grown over the years and is positioned for the future, so is this art piece.  What aspects of Pascal Gaulthier's personality and profile did you want to emphasize, and why?  I feel that Pascal has very strong features both in his personality and facial makeup. Zooming in up close and looking all around his face represents the amount of scrutiny and pressure he is under and his strength to lead.  Who do you think are the most influential NFT artists today?  Collectively, digital artists engaged in ecosystem are showing the world the future of how tokenized assets can be traded peer-to-peer. This will lead to the tokenizing of many aspects of life, outside of the specific use of art. Artists are always the willful guinea pigs who take risks that sometimes find larger use cases for the masses in the process. Paying attention to the artists who take risks to better the space is valuable. This is the influence I am here for and pay attention to.  What was the most disruptive NFT project in history?  I think Rare Pepes are the most ongoing disruptive project in rare digital art history. They were ahead of the curve from the beginning and to this day the 'dank culture' is one that is growing exponentially and always inviting artists to create their own Pepe and expand the reach of the culture.  Describe your style in three words.  FAFO in 3D  Given the rise and the fall of the NFT market over the last 18 months, what’s your outlook on the future of NFT art?  I am an artist and all I want to do is make art. No matter digital or physical, all my art can utilize tokenization in unique applications based on each art work. The road for rare digital assets is still very new and largely unpaved. Artist secondary royalties is one of the paradigm changes in the art world that cannot be overlooked. All artists should benefit from their own success in perpetuity. This can evolve what it means to support artists and hopefully get us further away from the awful reality of 'the starving artist.'

We spoke with him about his work for the question and answer below.  Tell us about how/why you became an artist. Why do you choose to create NFTs?  I never had much say in the matter, creations oftentimes involuntarily evacuating from my insides without consideration. Sometimes I think in an effort to prevent rotting from the inside out. Or function as a senseless documentarian to our collective indifferent demise. I’ve always loved writing and in many ways those words fueled the rise and fall of brush or stylus, but I ended up in digital art because no one wanted the physical art I was making for the longest time. And my wife and I were drowning in the things I made, so it just made sense to not die under the inconsequence of those canvases. NFTs were a happy accident after several years creating digitally through a random internet entity who said I could sell digital art instead of having it accumulate two likes from pornography spam bots.  Talk about your artistic approach to creating an image for this year’s Most Influential.  Most of the things I make are birthed in retention ponds and highway medians. Restaurants in which you can consume peanuts and discard the casings haplessly on the floor. The world’s largest fleshlight next to a hell is real sign. This piece took a similar trajectory, examining the failing organs of a country. The ragged breath of a tapioca hospital bed. The sagging skin used as fresh asphalt to pave another highway to nowhere in particular. I delved deep and relished in the stagnation.  What aspects of Elizabeth Warren's personality and profile did you want to emphasize, and why?  Primarily delusion. In manufacturing a war that didn’t need to be fought, with an army that never needed to be made. Riding a war horse incapable of motion. Outside of a store incapable of happiness anymore. It’s reflective of a growing plague of people in general and the obsession to destroy instead of create.  Who do you think are the most influential NFT artists today?  Too many to answer. In fact, that abundance is the true beauty of this organism we’re all limbs on.  What was the most disruptive NFT project in history?  The most indigestion was caused by beef brothkos.

Given the rise and the fall of the NFT market over the last 18 months, what’s your outlook on the future of NFT art?  Digital art is an unstoppable current. Indifferent to market conditions. Simply pulverizing things in its path. Or propelling those willing to submit. There will be failures and flatlines and comings and goings. But those born to create. Those obsessed with probing our shared wounds will always be around. Those whose story pours from agape fingers and uses pie eyes as adhesive for the next digital strip mall or fumes for the next vague high. Those will always be around.

We spoke with LOGIK about his work for the question and answer below.  Tell us about how or why you became an artist. And why did you choose to create NFTs?  As a child, I was exposed to a wide variety of films, thanks to my dad's work in an advertising company and later a movie distribution company. I had access to promotional movie copies (before Blockbuster): classics, anime, French noir, Black films, dramas, horrors, and Disney movies. Growing up in Ferguson, St. Louis, I realized that the opportunities for someone who looks like me were limited, which was the driving force for me to create something of my own. I was already artistic and loved drawing in class. When I visited Disney World and other magical places, I was inspired to create something more vibrant and exciting than my environment. I was ultimately bored with what life had to offer and wanted to create and experience new things.  Talk about your artistic approach to creating an image for this year’s Most Influential.  I'm a gamer, from Atari to LAN parties in the early 2000s. I was addicted to World of Warcrack for a bit and participated in Gamebattles (IFYKYK). Like gaming, the crypto market has winners and losers; the newbies usually get owned (pwned).My NFT isn't an image; it comprises two animations! “Pwning N00BS” is inspired by Pacman and his gamelike NFT trading platform Blur.io because its appearance changes based on Ether's current 24-hour price difference. Thus, depending on whether the price of Ether is up or down, you will see a different version of the NFT.  When ETH is up, Pacman runs while chomping on endless ETH. When ETH is down, Pacman falls through a blissful bed of clouds.Pacman (Tieshun Roquerre) disrupted the NFT exchange industry, becoming both a hero and villain in the NFT world, which I illustrated with the halo and horns. Pacman designed Blur.io specifically for ""pro-NFT traders"" to offer speed and market transparency, leading Blur.io to become the number one NFT exchange by volume in 2022.

Tell us about how/why you became an artist. Why do you choose to create NFTs?  Although I managed to carve myself a successful career as a character designer in film I've always been passionate about fine art and created personal work since I can remember. I've been offered to exhibit my work numerous times even back then, but it took a lot of grit to get to the point where I am as a character designer and at the time I was convinced that I had to make a choice, which might also be related to my German heritage, where the ""jack of all trades"" is a deeply negative connotation. But those oil paintings and piles of drawings I was working on in my spare time all those years were also a necessity, as artists we need this freedom of expression or we get frustrated. I was also convinced that at some point things would align and I would start exhibiting.  But the reality has always been that proper gallery representation was only possible with physical works. If someone would have told me that at some point there will be collectors buying digital art in the form of NFTs I would have laughed. The truth is, while I enjoy the process of working traditionally, I've been a digital artist for more than 20 years, and I'm much more native to the medium. I'm using a crossover of techniques, between digital painting and 3-D animation and performance capture that can only exist in this medium and cannot be experienced otherwise, so the rise of NFTs has been a true blessing.  While the idea of creating physical paintings is not fully off the table, and I think they could actually complement my digital work in an installation, it currently seems more like a step back to me. I'm much more excited about the new ground that can be conquered with art that is at the cutting edge of technology.  2. Talk about your artistic approach to creating an image for this year's Most Influential.  My main concern with creating the piece was that I wanted to make sure it's inspired by Caroline's story but that it stays a piece of art in its own right, that it goes beyond being an editorial illustration. So it is loosely inspired by what I read about her, but when I sat down to write down and sketch ideas I was really going more into this intuitive mode, which I always do when creating art, as opposed to the more problem-solving approach when doing character design. Creating a piece like this involves a lot of trial and error, and I over-paint most of the elements numerous times until they are in a perfect relation and speak to me. I'm very fascinated by how placing familiar objects and figures in new constellations creates new layers of context and meaning. From a formal perspective, I love to work in this exciting realm between abstraction and figuration, and I often juxtapose these seemingly contradictory elements. I also like the idea that the place that I'm depicting and shaping in my work, a kind of ""digital limbo"" actually exists in an alternate reality, and that I'm merely excavating these fragments of memory like an archeologist.  3. What aspects of Caroline Ellison's personality and profile did you want to emphasize, and why?  One particular thing stood out to me, is when Caroline mentioned that SBF ""corrupted her values."" I found it intriguing that after being involved in the whole situation on such a deep level, in a powerful position as CEO of Alameda Research, and as a seemingly very intelligent person who won numerous math awards, she claimed that SBF somehow hijacked her mind so that she forgot her moral integrity along the way. This one anecdote basically gave me a literal head start, and after I turned her head into a jacuzzi where SBF could feel at home, everything else slowly fell into place.  The title of the piece is an ironic nod to the ""Effective Altruism"" movement which Caroline and SBF were part of, and which most likely will be seen in a different light after what went down with FTX.  4. Who do you think are the most influential NFT artists today?  Artists in the NFT space tend to be influential for a variety of reasons, some of which go beyond the quality of the art itself. Besides that, and from a more personal perspective as an artist, the ones that continuously impress me are Joe Pease, Jake Fried and Per Kristian Stoveland. I'm also enjoying Beeple's everydays and his video sculptures.  5. What was the most disruptive NFT project in history?  My first thought went to ""Goblintown.wtf"" but I'd rather give the trophy to Jack Butcher's ""Opepen"", to end on a more positive note.  6. Describe your style in three words.  That's not an easy task, but a curator named Snejana Krasteva once categorized my work as ""Cybernetic Existentialism"".  7. Given the rise and the fall of the NFT market over the last 18 months, what's your outlook on the future of NFT art?  Since 2021 I've seen my fair share of the cyclical nature of crypto, and I've learned to look at things in a more relaxed manner. Apart from that it is hard for me to imagine a future where digital art isn't becoming increasingly more popular and important. I've seen many digital art exhibitions in cities around the world, and I've witnessed how captivating this digital art revolution is for audiences. The biggest institutions of the art world, such as the MoMA in NY, are already adopting NFTs. The road to mainstream adoption might be long and winding, but I think there's no turning back.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | MARKET | RESEARCH,CoinDesk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/michael-kutsche-caroline-ellison-had-her-mind-hijacked,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/678d05e2c021b2946a9fe655d90a98c6e670caeb-1908x1059.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

We spoke with the artist about their work for the question and answer below.  How/Why You Became an Artist and Why NFTs:  I always knew since I was a little kid that creating was the main place where I felt most alive and most at peace. I've held onto that feeling ever since. Throughout my life, making art has allowed me to entertain my curiosity, connect with others and self-actualize in so many ways I never expected. I feel called every day to make something from nothing as a form of personal growth, but it's also fueled by my rebellious nature and the culture of skateboarding. My friends and I never wanted to have ""normal jobs"" or a 9-to-5.  When I finished school, I wanted to figure out how to professionally be myself, and so making my art became this process of self-excavation – digging within myself to share energy and deep parts of my soul with the world. It was very difficult at first, but as I created my world and visual language, I had to trust that others would find value in it, and eventually they did! I grew up around my grandmother who was a talented artist herself. Through her guidance and a few other teachers over the years, I learned the fundamentals and a little bit about my own tastes. At some point, it felt natural to express myself every day, in many different ways from photography to drawing.  Why NFTs? That's is a different story. I started learning about blockchain in 2020 and started to understand the social revolution currently happening toward decentralization. After years of only posting my work to social media and my website, the blockchain was a much more permanent way to self-publish my work. I minted my first NFT with my artwork in summer of 2021 and the support I received thereafter was incredible. I found myself in a space where I could connect directly with a global audience without the conventional gatekeepers. The traditional fine art world has so many issues and lacks transparency. NFT's attracted a group of future thinkers that wanted to work together and innovate to fix some of the problems. I couldn't help but want to be a part of that group… I've met so many friends in this supportive community and have been enjoying the ride ever since.  Artistic Approach to Most Influential Image:  Creating an image for CoinDesk's Most Influential is both an honor and a challenge. It's not just creating a portrait; it's about distilling the story into a layered experience with subtle references. I decided to focus my piece on aspects of the friend.tech app, which is the reason Racer was selected for Most Influential. Friend.tech launched with viral success, sparking a lot of controversy, and I wanted my piece to capture a bit of the chaos.  Emphasizing Aspects of Racer's Personality and Profile:  There's not a lot of publicly available information about Racer so I had to get imaginative ... I was not about to spend multiple ETH to buy his friend.tech key (even though that would have been fun to see what they talk about in there). One aspect of the story is that friend.tech came out shortly after the release of Coinbase's Base chain. So something I could tell about Racer is that he likes to move fast and innovate. This was the main personality trait I latched onto, so I decided to turn him into a literal ""racer."" This will probably go over most people's heads, but the style and layout of the piece is a playful nod to the manga comic / cartoon Speed Racer.  Most Influential NFT Artists Today:  There's no shortage of talent here, but if I had to pick a few of the most inspiring artists, it would be Jake Fried, Reuben Wu, Eva Eller, Billy Dinh and Seneca. I'm inspired by artists who are also passionate connectors – those who that can go deep and stay true to their craft, but also build thriving networks around their art.  Most Disruptive NFT Project in History:  I'd have to say Manifold! Richerd and his team have built out so much infrastructure for artists to thrive. Always making more open-source tools without asking much from the artists in return. I see Manifold becoming something like a Web3 version of the ""app store."" Transient Labs and Foundation are two other teams who I consider to be innovating at a very similar level, building tools to help artists.  Describe Your Style in Three Words:  Bold. Playful. Optimistic.  Outlook on the Future of NFT Art:  I see a lot of change coming in the next several years, but I can't exactly predict what it will look like. Currently, the fine art gallery world is slowly shrinking and the role of the gallery is changing as our communication methods change. My hope is that the future art world will be more equitable and transparent. NFTs will likely continue to splinter off into subcultures, and some of them will be more sustainable markets than others. It's already impossible to keep up with everything happening, and that will get even harder in the future. ... Still the essence of art remains. As long as creators keep pushing boundaries and platforms evolve, digital art will endure. It's not just a market; it's a revolution in how we value, consume and connect over art.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,CoinDesk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/efdot-racer-likes-to-move-fast-and-innovate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5e892d5066e9c70028da5df6149a35b82031488-964x1284.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Holders of a Most Influential NFT will receive a Pro Pass ticket to Consensus 2024 in Austin, TX. To learn more about Consensus, click here.  We spoke with her about her work for the question and answer below.  1. Tell us about how/why you became an artist. Why do you choose to create NFTs?  I've been an artist for as long as memory serves and don't remember choosing to be an artist, it sort of chose me. It's a state of being. In terms of collage work, my analog collage began in '93, digital collage in '98, sculptural collage in the early 00's, and holograms in '15. All of those previous chapters in my career led me to the type of digital collage works I'm doing now, and NFTs were a logical next step to bring everything full circle with my art.  2. Talk about your artistic approach to creating an image for this year's Most Influential.  ""No Finer Place"" is a 3D collaged motion work. The story takes us from Jesse's desk through his monitor, mind, and coding which brings us to the L2 world he's building with Base. It's part of my ongoing DeepCuts series – 3D collages with depth inspired by songs – and Petula Clark's ""Downtown"" played on repeat while creating it. If you listen to the lyrics from Jesse's POV inviting us to build a better world on Base, it makes sense. A place where everything's waiting for you and people gather in a bustling epicenter. The buildings are being actively constructed by different communities – art galleries, clubhouses, marketplaces – much like how construction happens in an IRL city's downtown. The environment is much brighter there with pink, blue, yellow, teal, and purple hues used in Base's on-chain summer. The skyline in the background are charts of Base's progress over the year and circuits connect each community to the next. I nearly titled it ""No Finer Base""!  3. What aspects of Jesse Pollak's personality and profile did you want to emphasize, and why?  I dove deep into Jesse's public profiles and interviews to get a sense of the motivation behind the man. After studying his background, I wanted to take the viewer inside the mind of his world-building. What goes on inside that brain of his? How does Jesse see our digital world in what it is vs. what it could be? What type of imagination does he wield to build the next iteration of the internet? He cares about community and progress, which is visually captured in the work.  4. Who do you think are the most influential NFT artists today?  The artists who dare to push the limits of their craft will influence the artists of tomorrow. An overgeneralization I know, but what they're experimenting with today, mixed with curiosity and self-driven tenacity, sets the stage for the next generation. The ones who go outside their comfort zone with their art en lieu of dialing it in. Like Bowie's quote ""go a little bit out of your depth and when you don't feel your feet touching the bottom, you're in the right place to do something exciting"". And you can unmistakably see that type of rule-breaking in their mind-bending work, you can't fake it.  5. What was the most disruptive NFT project in history?  It's a tie between Kevin McCoy's Quantum and Robbie Bharat's AI Generated Nudes/Lost Robbies. The grandpappys of all grandpappys. Both historic and wildly disruptive towards the concept of transacting digital art, auction houses, collectors, and even the courts.  6. Describe your style in three words.  Collaged cautionary tales.  7. Given the rise and the fall of the NFT market over the last 18 months, what's your outlook on the future of NFT art?  The future is bright. More gallerists are introducing tokenized fine art into their exhibition programming, and museums like MoMA and LACMA are welcoming more works into permanent collections. Art movements take time to establish themselves institutionally and we're on the right track. Regarding fine art, I think we're going to eventually meet the art world halfway and adopt these terms they already assign for digital works: media art, internet art, and time-based media for motion works. Granted, digital works are called that without being tokenized, so maybe the terms contemporary media art or modern media art will be used to mark that distinction, and this art movement.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET,CoinDesk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/rebecca-rose-what-goes-on-inside-that-brain-of-jesse-pollaks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8004781a1b9a7ff8b44e3273027607fd83b80eaf-4000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

We spoke with P1A about her work for the question and answer below.  Tell us about how/why you became an artist. Why do you choose to create NFTs?  I wished to become an artist a long time ago, choosing this path at the age of 15. Always believing life dances between the givers and the takers, the producers and the consumers. I just knew I was hungry to create from a young age. Naturally crypto and the ethos behind the blockchain keeps inspiring me every day to build on top of my skills – pushing the boundaries of creation to another level. I minted my first NFT during '21 summer. NFTs and crypto art are great tools to utilize digital assets, a new wave of how things could be – another possibility that relies on the community behind it. I just love to be on this wave, which I believe in.  Talk about your artistic approach to creating an image for this year's Most Influential.  First of all, I am insanely proud to be one of the selected few for this honorable event and drop! My first approach in creating Refik Anadol's Study was to give him a deeper look, especially to his journey, my study, which is well known for sketching, is a serving concept covers the layer of shift from an idea to reality – and knowing how Refik collects the data – almost the reverse card of creating.  What aspects of Refik Anadol's personality and profile did you want to emphasize, and why?  Anadol's ability to create experimental and ""thought-provoking"" experiences through collected data installations has influenced the bridge we all build – reflecting our realities. Like Anadol, I am drawn to the intersection of art and technology, Refik's commitment to explore the boundaries of creativity and engaging with contemporary subjects clicks with me therefore I couldn't help but emphasize from his momentum and movement of the dynamic works of his such as Unsupervised and tried to adapt myself for in the same linguistic approach!  Who do you think are the most influential NFT artists today?  Refilk is surely one of the names that comes in mind when the subject is NFT's following with Beeple, XCopy and, personally I inspire so much from Dave Krugman, he proved to me how beautiful can it be that sharing together and growing together is possible. Till this day I still inspire from his approach to the audience he creates surrounding himself!  What was the most disruptive NFT project in history?  Crypto Punks! The collection rules the throne of my heart since day one I learned about them! Created by Matt Hall and John Watkinson, was among the first NFT projects on the Ethereum blockchain. Being launched early on 2017 and oftenly regarded as the first-ever NFTs and have played a significant role in popularizing the concept of digital ownership and scarcity in the NFT space for me that's very disruptive – the first steps of this movement we are in!  Describe your style in three words.  Hard one but it would go like: balance, birth and red  Given the rise and the fall of the NFT market over the last 18 months, what's your outlook on the future of NFT art?  When we look out the era of fast-consumed society there are certain repeating elements we see like ""hype"" and many cultures just like NFTs, becoming a stone rock solid in different shifting waves coming with it. I believe rise of bull market of NFT's got a great attention to our world even myself got involved in the first wave of this adventure – the fall down proved us the ancient rules of ""survival of the fittest"" funny how it works on diverse diciplines being buit including in the NFT environment as well.

We spoke with La Vaun about their work for the question and answer below.  1. Tell us about how/why you became an artist. Why do you choose to create NFTs?  Back when I was a kid, I used to wait for Dad to come home from the university. It was like a daily countdown until our special drawing time. after his days as a university lecturer, he'd come home, books in hand, and whisk me away into the world of creativity. As soon as he walked through that door, we'd grab our sketchpads, sit down, and let our imaginations run wild.  As a linguist publishing books on language, Dad instilled in me the idea that the world was boundless, and life was too short not to explore its vastness. He appeared to sense the potential concealed within his boy. And in those formative years, he'd instill in me a mantra that would echo through my life: ""Sky is the limit."" I guess I never consciously wanted to be an artist. art itself chose me to be its sidekick.  Why did I choose to create NFTs? As far as I can recall, it was in September 2021. It all began when my high school buddy, Billy The Cobra, shot me a message one day after years of silence. In that conversation, he nudged me toward the realm of NFTs, expressing his belief that confining my art to conventional spaces would be a missed opportunity. Little did I know that this digital frontier held a profound connection with the teachings of anarchism.  NFTs, in their essence, embrace the spirit of anarchy, challenging the established norms of the art world. The blockchain, with its decentralized nature, becomes a canvas for rebellion, mirroring the anarchic philosophy. It's a revolutionary shift where artists and enthusiasts break free from traditional gatekeepers and forge a new path.  In this anarchic dance of pixels and codes, NFTs become a powerful tool, not just for artistic expression but as a form of resistance. The conventional art establishment, often centralized and exclusive, finds itself confronted by the decentralized and inclusive nature of NFTs. It's a rebellion against the traditional power structures, a call to democratize art, and an invitation for artists to reclaim their narrative in this digital revolution.  2. Talk about your artistic approach to creating an image for this year's Most Influential.  In shaping this year's Most Influential painting, I resonate with Adorno's stance on societal norms: ""Art is the social antithesis of society."" Channeling the essence of critical theory and societal critique championed by Adorno, the depiction of Brad Garlinghouse leading through a wintry landscape symbolizes a nuanced rebellion against ingrained norms.  Reflecting Adorno's belief in art's transformative power, the composition aims to spark contemplation on the shifting dynamics of power and societal norms, echoing his call for art that challenges the status quo. It's a visual narrative infused with Adorno's wisdom, fostering a reflective dialogue about the transformative journey within the crypto realm.  3. What aspects of Brad Garlinghouse's personality and profile did you want to emphasize, and why?  When I dove into creating this piece featuring Brad Garlinghouse, it wasn't just about slapping an image on the screen – I aimed to capture some profound vibes. Set against the backdrop of Crypto Winter 2023 and Ripple's resilient comeback from the SEC drama, I envisioned Brad as this strategic commander, navigating the snowy peaks of the market, a distant castle lit up. In this narrative, I want to emphasize Brad's leadership, toughness, and future vision with the aim of creating a piece that transcends the canvas – something with depth, a touch of flair, and a sense of historical significance.  Incorporating the XRP Army as an online cavalry rolling with Brad adds a layer of community love, underlining the team effort that played a significant part in this monumental comeback tale. By framing Brad's profile against the backdrop of a major era in cryptocurrency, this piece is set to capture not just Ripple's win but also the lasting impact of Brad's leadership during a time that's going to be etched in the crypto hall of fame. It's a visual narrative crafted to serve as a shoutout to a comeback that left a mark on Ripple and the wider crypto scene.  4. Who do you think are the most influential NFT artists today?  It's a challenging question, but we are thankful to have Rata Yonqui. For me, in every aspect, he is the ultimate number one of all time.  5. What was the most disruptive NFT project in history?  In my opinion, the most disruptive NFT project in history is ""RektGuy"" by Ovie Faruq. This artwork embodies a profound philosophical meaning of disruption within the crypto space. The term ""Rekt"" in crypto slang refers to getting wrecked or facing significant losses, and Ovie cleverly weaves humor into this concept. The disruptive nature of the project lies in its ability to address the fear of failure and the importance of resilience in the volatile crypto world.  Faruq's creation serves as a historical milestone, teaching people the courage to embrace disruption and delivering a crucial message about the significance of honing one's spiritual qualities in the crypto realm. ""RektGuy"" is not just a work of art; it is a collection of pure grails and an insightful project that navigates the challenges of disruptions, serving as a key artifact in the emerging culture capable of providing soul training.  6. Describe your style in three words.  It's a good question, though a tough one. Much like a pilot with a helicopter view who can't observe their driving style from below, I find it difficult to gauge how my work and style are. Nevertheless, I'll sum it up with three words: Moment. Before. Oblivion.  7. Given the rise and the fall of the NFT market over the last 18 months, what's your outlook on the future of NFT art?  The future of NFT art is poised for a revolutionary ascent. Beyond the recent market dynamics, it symbolizes a cultural shift that's just beginning. We're witnessing the birth of a new era where artists and collectors redefine the boundaries of creativity and ownership. This journey is a boundless exploration, a canvas waiting to be painted with unprecedented possibilities.

We spoke with Shavonne about her work for the question and answer below.  1. Tell us about how/why you became an artist. Why do you choose to create NFTs?  My journey into the world of art was quite organic. Coming from a background in fashion and advertising photography, creativity has always been a part of me. However, it was during the COVID-19 pandemic that I made a significant pivot into 3D art. It was only later, when I discovered NFTs, that I fully embraced the role of an artist. NFTs provided an exciting avenue to create and share art in the digital age. The ability to connect with a global audience was particularly appealing and drew me into this new realm.  2. Talk about your artistic approach to creating an image for this year's Most Influential.  My focus for my piece was to convey a narrative about surveillance, a theme that resonates with the times we live in. I chose a direct visual language that everyone can understand, the imagery of being watched. The composition places the viewer inside a Worldcoin orb, which is a nod to the omnipresent eye of technology, and looks out at Sam Altman. It's stark, a little unsettling, but it's meant to be thought-provoking and start conversations about where technology is taking us.  3. What aspects of Sam Altman's personality and profile did you want to emphasize, and why?  In portraying Sam Altman, I didn't want to just focus on his achievements or his status in the tech world. Instead, I wanted to reflect on the broader implications of his work. Altman's involvement in projects that deal with data and surveillance made him a perfect subject for this piece. By placing him in the center, scrutinized by the same technology he helps to create, I wanted to show that no one is exempt from surveillance—not even those who are behind it. It's a simple take on a complex issue, reminding us that our advances come with a set of eyes that are always open.  4. Who do you think are the most influential NFT artists today?  The realm of NFT art is brimming with influential artists who continuously push the boundaries of the medium, crafting breathtaking and innovative work.

We spoke with the artist about their work for the question and answer below.  Tell us about how/why you became an artist. Why do you choose to create NFTs?  Throughout my career, I've been a 'creative', but primarily in a role where my art served others—helping to build brands, crafting television commercials, and promoting products. Choosing to tokenize my digital art was a pivotal decision. It shifted control and value back into my hands, empowering me to weave my own narrative. This journey isn’t just about art; it's about reclaiming my story and my worth.  Talk about your artistic approach to creating an image for this year’s most Influential.  I've always admired early innovations in technology, (just quietly, I have some inscriptions under 10k). However, delving into the person behind the tech was new terrain for me. I started with scouring images of Casey to train an AI, but high-quality, recent photos were scarce. Through numerous AI iterations, coupled with manual digital painting and editing, I crafted the likeness and style I envisioned. My initial stoic renditions evolved as I realized Casey wasn't just another elusive figure like Satoshi. His videos revealed a passion for code, yet a drive to infuse humanity and fun into his work. This duality inspired my portrait, capturing how innovations can bring push and pull, pleasure and pain.  What aspects of Casey Rodarmor's personality and profile did you want to emphasize, and why?  In portraying Casey, I sought to depict the struggle of staying true to oneself amidst overwhelming external voices. The portrait reflects the duality of emotions experienced during groundbreaking progress.  Who do you think are the most influential NFT artists today?  Artists like Beeple, Pak, Xcopy, Slimesunday, Sam Spratt and Josie Bellini stand out as influential figures. Others that come to mind with impact but not as much reach; Nahiko, Dirty Robot, Raoul Marks, Jen Stark and Jenni Pasanen.  What was the most disruptive NFT project in history?  In terms of disruption, Beeple's 'The first drop' collection stands out. It not only reflected the cross over of crypto art, politics and culture at the time, but also changed the perception of how digital art can be received and released.  Describe your style in three words.  Exploration. Hope. Pain.  Given the rise and the fall of the NFT market over the last 18 months, what’s your outlook on the future of NFT art?  We're just getting started.

42391874,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxCLb,1701696226,Ian Allison's Giant Sam Bankman-Fried Scoop Won Accolades in 2023,"The adrenaline rush arrived swiftly after Reuters got word out from the courtroom that the jury had decided Sam Bankman-Fried's fate. I went downstairs to get water for my suddenly dry mouth and told my wife, while feeling like my body was floating a few inches off the ground, that the climax of a crazy year in crypto was here. Back upstairs in my home office, I read the verdict minutes later. The former FTX CEO was guilty.  This was Nov. 2, 2023. Exactly a year earlier, sitting at this same desk, I'd clicked the publish button on a monumental scoop from CoinDesk's Ian Allison that started it all. His article – and this really doesn't need to be said yet again because it's lore repeated by journalists and others over and over – exclusively revealed evidence that Bankman-Fried's hedge fund, Alameda Research, and therefore his systemically important FTX crypto exchange might be on shaky footing. (We all learned later that Bankman-Fried had stolen billions of dollars from customers, which explains why the balance sheet that Allison based his story on looked so odd.)  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  The industry panicked. Bankman-Fried needed a bailout. Binance supplied one, but that rapidly fizzled and a crypto empire found itself in bankruptcy court just nine days after Allison's story. Bankman-Fried was arrested soon after.  Journalists love scoops, or telling secrets to the world. Allison's was a doozy. There have been other huge scoops. Coverage of the Watergate scandal by The Washington Post's Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein might be the most famous example. About nine months before Enron filed for bankruptcy, Bethany McLean raised questions about its accounting in Fortune magazine. Allison belongs in the Journalism Hall of Fame, too, as validated by Bankman-Fried's conviction in 2023. His story stopped the fraud at FTX, a key player in crypto and a company once valued at $32 billion. There's little, if any, precedent for the size and speed of the waves his article stirred up.  Allison, a Scotsman by birth, also might be the nicest and humblest person you'll meet. Before I joined CoinDesk in 2022, a source told me he was a pro I'd enjoy working with. That was an understatement. I've worked with him for 16 months and he's been at CoinDesk for five years. I hope both numbers stretch to infinity.  It needs to be said, too, that the whole CoinDesk newsroom excelled in covering the collapse of Bankman-Fried and FTX. Other journalists joined Allison in winning three major accolades: the Polk, Loeb and New York Press Club awards.  'Journalism with integrity, regardless of the cost'  As put by CoinDesk Editor-in-Chief Kevin Reynolds, a former senior editor at Bloomberg News, when speaking on behalf of Allison, who couldn't attend, and other members of the CoinDesk team at the Loeb ceremony in September: ""I've never seen better teamwork or a better overall performance.""  He continued: ""I had initially planned to end this speech with 'the best is yet to come,' a message of optimism that would have also been a playful homage to the legendary Matt Winkler from whom I learned so much at Bloomberg. However, given the severity of the winter gripping the crypto industry, a downturn partly precipitated by the very reporting and editing that we're being honored for tonight, I can no longer say with certainty that the best is yet to come for CoinDesk.""  And then Reynolds got to the heart of what Allison and others did: ""Our future has been now made uncertain by the very work we're being honored for right now. And, yet, this makes me prouder, if that's even possible, of my fellow CoinDeskers because I know without a shred of doubt that had we the gift of prophecy and known our own work might put ourselves out of a job, there's not a reporter or editor at CoinDesk who would have done a thing differently. Journalism with integrity, regardless of the cost. That's the CoinDesk way.""  (FTX's demise hurt CoinDesk's parent company, Digital Currency Group, because it drove CoinDesk's corporate sibling Genesis into bankruptcy. CoinDesk's prospects brightened after Reynolds spoke: In November, DCG sold it to Bullish, a crypto exchange run by former New York Stock Exchange President Tom Farley.)  The Bankman-Fried piece was not Allison's first or last significant story. Months before Wall Street heavyweight BlackRock said it would let clients buy and sell crypto through its trading platform, Allison told readers that might be coming. This year, he broke the shocking news that BlackRock was planning a bitcoin ETF, something that was confirmed by the company soon after. That decision sparked a large bitcoin rally.  Told he'd be included in CoinDesk's list of most influential people for 2023, Allison replied: ""OMG! I'm honored,"" followed immediately by, ""Are you sure?""  He's prowling for his next big scoop.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,Nick Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/ian-allison-sam-bankman-fried-ftx-alameda-research,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/293cc75ada8bb85aa7814abcb2634fe495ae2b96-350x350.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Leung took office in January 2023, and her term coincides with Hong Kong's fresh attempts to establish itself as a major digital assets hub.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  Leung, a former journalist at The Asian Wall Street Journal, may seem to have an unusual background for a regulator. But, in addition to being a former journalist, she has more than 25 years in public service and extensive experience in financial regulation, market development and international cooperation. She served at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority for 14 years, spending the last eight years as the executive director responsible for financial cooperation with Mainland China and international regulators.  Leung and her colleagues have made a concerted push to put Hong Kong on the map of crypto hotspots. ""Cryptocurrency platforms are part of the whole Web3 ecosystem and we are very supportive of the development of the whole Internet ecosystem,"" she said at the 2023 Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference.  At the beginning of the year, the SFC paved the way for licensed retail trading for a select group of cryptocurrencies, but with various restrictions. For example, Leung said at the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong, only ""highly liquid"" assets will be on the list.  In February, the Hong Kong securities watchdog published proposed rules for virtual asset trading platforms and collected public comments. In June, right after Beijing released its Web3 white paper, Hong Kong's new licensing regime for virtual assets service providers took effect and the SFC began accepting license applications for crypto exchanges.  Several months later, the SFC decided to disclose all crypto license applicants after an unlicensed crypto platform JPEX scandal. By December, three firms, including OSL Digital Securities, HashKey Exchange and Investment Firm Victory Securities, had been awarded retail trading licenses.  In November, Hong Kong reversed its stance on spot-crypto ETF investing, allowing intermediaries to offer services to a wider range of clients in November. The city also recently allowed some tokenized securities issuance and trading (referring to where tokens represent underlying investment assets).  Under Leung's leadership, the SFC issued Swiss crypto bank SEBA a license to conduct regulated activities in Hong Kong to deal in and distribute virtual assets-related products. Starting in November, UBS Group's wealthy clients could trade three crypto ETFs authorized by the SFC in Hong Kong.  Leung has a key role in orchestrating crypto activity in an important financial center.

42391870,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxC15,1701696179,Martin Köppelmann Is Fighting to Keep Crypto Tech on Track,"Martin Köppelmann, the Berlin-based co-founder of Gnosis Chain, has no problem speaking his mind. In addition to building some of the biggest blockchain tools on Ethereum, he is also looked to as a thought leader – a philosopher-developer with strong opinions on how blockchain tech can evolve without compromising on its core ethos.  Like many early blockchain enthusiasts, Köppelmann first learned about Bitcoin [BTC] in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. He'd grown intrigued by a new German political group, a branch of the Pirate Party, which took a unique approach to group decision-making. ""It was meant to be this very member-driven party, and they had this concept, 'liquid democracy,' where by default everyone can vote on everything,"" Köppelmann explained in an interview.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  Köppelmann joined the Pirate Party in 2010 as members were weighing whether to vote in favor of a eurozone bailout package for Greece, whose economy was in freefall.  ""You need to dig deep into how money works, how central banking works,"" Köppelmann recalled. ""Previously I hadn't thought about those things very much,"" and exploring how money works and what it is was ""how I discovered Bitcoin.""  Köppelmann's first blockchain company, Fairlay, grew into the largest bitcoin-based prediction market before he sold it. ""Over the years I became quite skeptical about bitcoin in many ways, but certainly, in that period, I was kind of a bitcoin maximalist,"" said Köppelmann. ""I quite quickly concluded that bitcoin is awesome because it shows other forms of money are possible, but the concrete form of bitcoin is not necessarily what I believe is the best for humanity.""  Today, Köppelmann is more closely associated with Ethereum. After meeting Joe Lubin, the Ethereum co-founder who now heads Consensys, a research and development firm behind the popular Metamask crypto wallet, Köppelmann became enthusiastic about the potential for programmable smart contracts and launched Gnosis, a betting market for the Ethereum ecosystem.  ""The prediction stuff never became successful,"" said Köppelmann, ""but the infrastructure stuff eventually became successful."" Gnosis ultimately bought and merged with xDAI, another blockchain, to create a privacy-focused ""side-chain"" to help scale up Ethereum's capabilities. Spin-offs from Gnosis, like Safe (a popular multi-signature wallet solution) and CoWSwap (a MEV-resistant exchange protocol) have become enormously successful independent of their parent project.  In addition to becoming a key builder in the Ethereum ecosystem, Köppelmann has also emerged as one of its most vocal critics – frequently calling out projects, infrastructure and technical updates that he feels fall short of the network's founding ideals.  Köppelmann has sounded the alarm bell loudest on the issue of censorship, where he's voiced concern that certain elements of Ethereum's infrastructure – particularly the block that assembles most blocks – are kowtowing to government sanctions in a manner at odds with the network's core philosophy.  ""For a long time, I was very aligned with the broader Ethereum research community,"" reflected Köppelmann. ""But at least on this censorship or MEV topic, my opinion was a little bit different from where Ethereum was going. I certainly disagreed here.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | RESEARCH,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/martin-koppelmann-is-fighting-to-keep-crypto-tech-on-track,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/002c7c395e0498933ef38109e21d253d22e65073-350x350.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It's a role the Massachusetts Democrat has not shied away from; over the years, she's become a vocal skeptic of the industry's promises, casting doubt during Senate hearings and introducing bills that would enact tighter guardrails on some aspects of crypto.  Following the collapse of FTX, Silicon Valley Bank and other disasters in the industry, Senator Warren has seemingly become more comfortable with acting as the face of Congress' criticism of the industry.

""Big time financial criminals love crypto,"" she said during a February Senate hearing on crypto. ""Just last year, just in one year, crypto was the payment method of choice for international drug traffickers, who raked in over a billion dollars through crypto; North Korean hackers, who stole $1.7 billion and funneled that money into their nuclear program; and ransomware attackers, who took in almost $500 million. The crypto market took in $20 billion last year in illicit transactions and that's only the part we know about.""  When Politico declared she was ""building an anti-crypto army,"" Warren put that headline onto campaign advertisements on X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.  And while public statements are one tool in a lawmaker's armory, interactions with regulators and legislation may have far more immediate and long-reaching impacts. In 2023, Warren wrote letters to crypto companies asking about their banking habits and national security and Treasury Department regulators asking how they'll track crypto crime  The potentially most impactful bill she's working on is the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act, a bipartisan bill with support from heavy hitters in the Senate. While time is fast running out for legislation to become law in the current Congressional session, growing support could signal more movement next year.  Meet Die with most likes, the artist who created a digital portrait of Senator Elizabeth Warren.  Warren has a storied history. Perhaps her most famous regulatory win was her lobbying for what would eventually become the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent agency tasked with ensuring financial institutions aren't defrauding or taking advantage of U.S. persons that was created following the 2008 financial crisis.  The CFPB's goals would seem to dovetail with some of the crypto industry's stated goals of providing banking services to un- and underbanked individuals. But, in Warren's world, the scams and losses outweigh those aspirational promises.  ""Some in the crypto industry say that anti-money laundering rules can work so long as they exempt so-called decentralized entities – the crypto exchanges, lenders and other financial intermediaries that run on code,"" she said at the February hearing. ""The rules should be simple.

Not least of these was FTX, whose downfall was precipitated by the reporting by a then DCG-owned company – CoinDesk, the publisher of this very article (crypto is incestuous!). In November, DCG sold CoinDesk to Bullish, an institutional digital assets exchange, helping Silbert make a sizable profit on his original $500,000 purchase in 2016.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  Formation and Expansion of Digital Currency Group  Since its inception in 2015, DCG, which is based in Stamford, Connecticut, has evolved into a conglomerate with holdings across the blockchain sector (as of 2023, it has stakes in more than 160 companies, from mining to analytics). Silbert began investing in the industry in 2013 and, following the sale of SecondMarket, he formed DCG. The company's early focus was on Genesis and Grayscale, which became its first subsidiaries.  Navigating Challenges  In November 2022, the company faced significant setbacks with its subsidiary, Genesis Trading, losing approximately $175 million due to the bankruptcy of the Bahamas-based cryptocurrency exchange FTX. This incident led to a freeze of customer withdrawals and loan applications, impacting Genesis Global Capital as well.  In early 2023, amid disputes with shareholders and the challenging economic climate, Silbert found himself defending his position as CEO against calls for his replacement by debtor Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, another crypto exchange. During this period, DCG considered selling parts of its venture capital holdings to raise funds.  Strategic decisions and legal controversies  2023 also saw Genesis Global Capital file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, with DCG making a strategic decision to either sell its Genesis unit or turn its equity over to creditors. This move reflected Silbert's pragmatic approach to navigating financial challenges. However, the firm's decisions were not without controversy.  In July 2023, DCG faced a lawsuit from Gemini, citing fraud with the intent of reclaiming funds. This was followed by a lawsuit filed by the New York attorney general in October 2023, alleging that DCG, Gemini Trust, and Genesis Capital had defrauded investors of more than $1.1 billion. In late November, the two groups agreed to a settlement that will see DCG repay Gemini hundreds of millions of dollars.  Silbert's leadership of Digital Currency Group through a period marked by significant industry shifts and regulatory challenges reflects both his resilience and adaptability. Silbert's decisions and strategies, while sometimes controversial, underscore his influence and the pivotal role DCG still plays in the broader cryptocurrency landscape.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING,Michele Musso,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/barry-silbert-digital-currency-group-dcg,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c2a76add46ef075795c02804c270d63217d38fb4-350x350.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But in 2023, Nike became one of the largest brands in the world championing a connected future.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  Ron Faris heads up Nike Virtual Studios, and is dedicated to digital and virtual experiences that deepen relationships with fans and customers. Faris is no stranger to technology and innovation, having spent time at Atari and Virgin Mobile, before starting a content and commerce company that Nike acquired. His role is to develop digital-first experiences for the brand's fanatic sneakerheads.  Nike introduced .SWOOSH this year as its first real blockchain-native experiment after its acquisition of NFT Studio RTFKT in late 2021. The initiative started out as an identity play with .SWOOSH IDs minted through a partnership with brand-courting crypto project Polygon and custody specialist BitGo.  Faris' stated goal is to democratize co-collaboration and curate communities in new ways. He and his team did not launch .SWOOSH through crypto channels, but instead focused on core sneaker collectors, local athletes and meetups. He intended to not only introduce the initiative but to answer questions about the new technologies that have often been met with skepticism by subcultures like sneaker collectors and gamers.  More than 370,000 people grabbed the IDs with little understanding of what they unlocked at the time. Nike soon revealed that those with an ID could collect Nike's first virtual product drop, Our Force 1, digitally modeled after its Air Force 1 silhouette.  The uptake is another encouraging sign for future mainstream adoption along the likes of Pepsi and Starbucks, though most mainstream companies have been muted in saying these projects are anything more than experiments. Nike has pushed the narrative along this year with .SWOOSH integrations with Fortnite, EA Sports, physical drops and other benefits being teased out.  In a marketing world of social media dominance, where brands are trying hard to create direct relationships with their customers, Faris and the Nike team are connecting more than most. ""This is our effort in creating a digital marketplace for the future, which is powered by digital, which harmonizes products, experiences, and services in new ways which meet the consumer where they are,"" Faris told Hypebeast in April.  As many in the corporate landscape have cooled to Web3 during 2023, Nike, under the guidance of Faris, is building quickly with digital collectibles, limited-release access and interconnected game unlocks to create a key pillar in a future-forward marketing strategy.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MATIC | TECHNOLOGY,Sam Ewen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/ron-faris-at-nike-is-running-with-web3,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0eb9b5565b91b49d2dda3b803063f7a3808ad65c-350x350.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42391872,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxCGT,1701696019,Caroline Pham: Supportive Regulation at the CFTC,"This was not a good year for relations between crypto companies and regulators. Gary Gensler's aggressive approach to enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission, which included major investigations of Coinbase, Kraken and other leading names, rankled an industry that complained about arbitrary rule-making and arbitrary justice.  But not all regulators on the crypto beat struck an antagonistic posture. One who stood out was Caroline D. Pham, a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, who proposed a ""time-limited"" pilot program at the CFTC to regulate crypto markets and tokenization that was noticeably more friendly to industry needs.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  Her aim, she said, was to support the development of compliant digital asset markets, drawing from past experiences with pilot programs, while incorporating registration, eligibility requirements, financial resources, risk management, product terms and reporting requirements.  The idea was a twist on a common approach to regulation seen elsewhere in the world (known as ""the sandbox""). That's when crypto startups get to develop their ideas within the loose embrace of regulators, rather than working alone and hoping for clearance on regulation when they release products in the real world.  Pham's proposal signified a proactive approach toward the evolving digital asset industry, especially given the lack of a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. thus far.  That wasn't the only accommodative gesture from the former managing director at Citigroup. Following the Ripple [XRP] court ruling in 2023, a split decision on whether the company illegally offered XRP as a security, Pham emphasized the need for a holistic approach to crypto regulation that aligns with international standards.  She referred to the global regulatory framework for crypto-asset activities released by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) as a model for harmonized regulation. That contrasts with the point-of-view of many U.S. regulators and politicians who stress the need for the USA to plow its own furrow, rather than emulating jurisdictions, such as the European Union, which enacted the wide-ranging MiCA legislation this year.  The FSB framework aims to ensure consistent and comprehensive regulation of crypto assets and global stablecoins, in line with the principle of ""same activity, same risk, same regulation."" And Pham highlighted the importance of aligning U.S. regulations with international standards to foster innovation while managing risks associated with digital assets.  Regulatory sandbox  In a speech at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, in September 2023, Pham called for the creation of a U.S. regulatory sandbox for digital assets. This sandbox would serve as a controlled environment for testing innovative private-sector propositions and projects, she said.  Pham stressed the need for the CFTC to use its authority to provide regulatory clarity for digital assets, ensuring robust guardrails are in place. Her proposal aimed to establish a principles-based framework for innovation in technology, new products, and market structures.  Commissioner Caroline Pham joins Commissioner Hester Peirce at the SEC in standing out as a regulator who wants to see crypto grow and thinks regulators should get out of the way as much as possible. It's questionable how much influence she will have going forward (the larger SEC is in the driving seat on crypto regulation and enforcement). But planting a flag for an accommodative approach to crypto should be applauded.",POSITIVE,XRP,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | XRP,Michele Musso,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/caroline-pham-supportive-regulation-at-the-cftc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e11c013e08b6ae7070970b4a9e11865784e320b8-350x350.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42391871,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxCBL,1701695998,Antonio Juliano: Uprooting a Successful Exchange to Explore the Cosmos,"Antonio Juliano's decentralized exchange dYdX could be said to be one of the most successful projects ever launched on Ethereum. In 2021, Bloomberg reported that dYdX briefly overtook Coinbase, the largest U.S.-based exchange, in trading volumes – although the comparison between derivatives and spot trading, which dYdX and Coinbase focused on, respectively, is a bit like apples and oranges.  Still, at its height, dYdX executed billions of dollars worth of trades per day for several thousand users, and was backed by crypto notables including Polychain Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. Which is why Juliano's decision to move the derivatives exchange off Ethereum and into the Cosmos ecosystem, using its own custom-built blockchain, was such a notable decision. It was a huge risk.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  This year, Juliano and his team successfully launched a new version of dYdX. This required recoding the six-year-old project, launching test networks and building an off-chain order book, another way the project hoped to scale.  ""We can't build something like this on Ethereum,"" Juliano said in a September interview. Ethereum, of course, has been known for its problems with transaction throughput since its inception. It's why its coterie of coders has been hard at work for revamping the chain – including launching a reworked proof-of-stake backbone, exploring technically complex innovations like ""proto-danksharding"" and building a plethora of scalable add-ons called layer 2s.  It's also why countless other blockchains have launched to compete with and supplement Ethereum. There's the old guard like Cardano and Polkadot, each built by an original Ethereum founder, and ultra-new chains like Aptos and Sui, built by former Facebookers.  But for Juliano, Cosmos, which is like a blockchain for blockchains, offered the most compelling vision for scalability. ""We need more on the order of 1,000-plus transactions per second,"" he said. Cosmos offered Juliano the customizability he needed to finally achieve his vision for dYdX, which has evolved over the past half-decade. This includes building a protocol–specific mempool, to store unfinalized txns, and finding the perfect number of validators, to balance execution and decentralization.  Juliano, a Pittsburgh, PA, native who graduated from Princeton, has been working in the crypto industry since taking his first job out of college at Coinbase in 2015, which he joined because he was attracted by its unusual hiring process. Oddly enough, the way he described it, he only became a blockchain believer after working at the exchange and hearing lectures from industry luminaries like Vitalik Buterin and Polychain's Olaf Carlson-Wee.  He caught the entrepreneurial bug after just a year at Coinbase, and went on to found a search engine for the decentralized web called Weipoint. Juliano admits his first effort was a dud, and estimates it gained less than a dozen users by the time he called it quits. At the time, he was also working at Uber.  ""My journey as a founder started with a ton of coding for the first few years, and now mostly CEO-ing. I've loved both parts and especially love my job today. I feel extremely fortunate to work with the best people, on hard and meaningful problems that will drive large change in the world long term,"" Juliano, who is the oldest of four siblings, told CoinDesk in an email recently.  Today, dYdX has about 50 employees and is on its fourth version (v4) and second blockchain. It's had some notable ups and downs since jumping chains, including an alleged exploit that led to a loss of $9 million in an insurance payout, as well as a successful governance vote to enable validators to earn a share of trading rewards.  A recent Messari report found that dYdX, the established brand rerooted this year, once again leads in its share of market volumes. Though all that scalability and customizability for what? It still suffers from crypto's core complaint: There's only a couple hundred daily, active users.",POSITIVE,없음,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/antonio-juliano-uprooting-a-successful-exchange-to-explore-the-cosmos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8fb37e63781bb1cd8908739d5c6c2c7a16283575-350x350.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

One community that has embraced this call to action is the Shiba Inu [SHIB] project, a Dogecoin [DOGE] competitor created in August 2020 by the pseudonymous Ryoshi, that is now commanded by also-pseudonymous Lead Developer Shytoshi Kusama.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  ""This year is focused on creating,"" Kusama wrote to CoinDesk. ""Devs from around the world are quietly building to ensure Shib is solidified amongst other giants in the space.""  Kusama has led the SHIB developers to take on his vision of creating ""a perpetual, decentralized, ""network state"" with a focus on dominating the DeFi (decentralized finance) faction of the crypto industry, they wrote. The team launched Shibarium, an Ethereum layer-2 blockchain, in August, expanding the SHIB token's use cases from an object of speculation to a cost-effective means of settlement for DeFi applications built on the network.  Shibarium, which also has ambitions in the realms of metaverse and gaming, was highly anticipated and saw over 20 million transactions on the ""Puppynet"" testnet, but also faced bridging challenges during the initial mainnet launch, sending the price of Shiba Inu token down some 9%.  Shytoshi and the vast network of developers also expanded Shiba Inu's presence from the digital world to the physical this year with ""Shibacals."" Kusama wrote in a blog post that using NFC chips in physical products to authenticate collectible items on the Shibarium blockchain could expand the network's use cases to ""creators, say people who sell on ETSY or have their own website for creating products, can simply add a Shibacal NFC tag and decide how they want to use this tag for their creations."" Currently, the SHIB community has created its own merchandise using the Shibacals authentication tools.  It doesn't stop there. Other noteworthy advancements from this year include a November announcement that the Manny Pacquiao Foundation, a nonprofit organization led by the World Boxing Council champion, will utilize the Shibarium blockchain for fundraising and other operation needs. In 2023, it was also revealed that blockchain and AI project Bad Idea AI would be a partner of Shiba Inu, which Shytoshi Kusama alluded to playing a pivotal role in the next phase of SHIB.  Where other projects may have lost momentum or interest during crypto winter, Kusama told CoinDesk SHIB has maintained its trajectory by embracing ""a community first mindset in all we do."" In November, it launched The Shibmagazine, which the Lead Developer wrote functions as ""a platform to highlight community involvement.""

In September, researchers dappGambl said 95% of NFTs may now have practically no value.

This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  ""Pudgy Penguins is going to 2x or 3x last year's revenue,"" he said in an interview. That's why Schnetzler, who spent part of his childhood homeless, is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential list for 2023.  In April of 2022, Schnetzler and a group of asset holders acquired the Pudgy Penguins NFT collection following a public bidding war that included Zach Burks of Mintable and Web 3 influencer BeanieMaxi. Since then, Schnetzler, who also goes by the shortened ""Luca Netz,"" helped to oust the founders and became CEO. He has led the brand with a ""thesis around emotional attachment,"" taking inspiration from the likes of Pokémon and Hello Kitty, he told CoinDesk.  While other leading NFT projects like the Bored Ape Yacht Club, which earlier this year hit a 20-month low floor price, leaned into Web 3 with initiatives including ApeCoin and Otherside, Schnetlzer said Pudgy Penguins ""needed to create a Web 2 approach and a real business.""  In May 2023, Pudgy Penguins completed a $9 million dollar fundraise. The same month, it began selling its ""Pudgy Toy"" collection online, a series of physical products modeled after the NFTs. The collectibles became available in 2,000 Walmart stores in the U.S. by the end of September and debuted in Canadian Toys R Us locations in November. The toys provide customers with access via a QR code to the Pudgy World platform on the zkSync Era blockchain, and have served as an entry point for new consumers who may not be familiar with the NFT collection or the broader Web 3 ecosystem.  Toys being linked to a digital experience may not be a novel concept (see Webkinz from the 2010s). But Pudgy Toys gives owners real IP for their money. We""took 16 holders [of Pudgy Penguin NFTs], 16 licensing arrangements, and made 16 toys. Every time one of those toys sells, they get the license in perpetuity,"" Schnetzler said. ""IPs have been built around brand and consumption, we want to change that to brand and participants.""  Pudgy Penguins has also garnered a non-crypto fanbase through its Web 2 social media platforms, sharing content like animated shorts of the Pudgy Penguins characters on TikTok (5.4 million likes) and Instagram (966k followers).  ""We've set a bar for what it looks like to be capitalized in this space and what people should be doing with the money they have,"" Schnetzler told CoinDesk reflecting on his accomplishments in 2023.

42391896,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxNQt,1701695794,Hayden Adams: From Ethereum Idealist to Business Realist at Uniswap,"The creation of Uniswap was cinematic.  In 2018, just a few months after Hayden Adams was introduced to crypto (by Karl Floersch, who also appears on the Most Influential 2023 list), Adams flew to South Korea to attend the Deconomy conference. He had been laid off from his first job out of college, a Siemens mechanical engineer, in mid-2017, and spent the intervening time learning to code, beginning essentially with beginner's-unfriendly smart contracts.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  He was 24, broke and primarily invested in cryptocurrency that had lost almost all of its value, purchased during the rising tide of 2017. But he also had a working prototype, a website and a name: Uniswap.  His friend Floersch had suggested Adams build something called an automated market maker (AMM), a type of decentralized protocol to swap assets without needing permission – first proposed by Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin.  On an act of faith, he bought a plane ticket but not a conference ticket, intent on demonstrating ""version 0"" of Uniswap to Buterin. He snuck into Deconomy. Then got kicked out. In a twist of fate, he ran into Floersch, who was working at the Ethereum Foundation. Floersch introduced Adams to Buterin. Within a couple months, Adams was presenting on his own at conferences: in Toronto, New York, Hong Kong.  At the time, there were big things built on Ethereum – but nothing quite like Uniswap. While giving speeches or meeting kindred spirits the world over, Adams would discuss not only the decentralized exchange but the meaning behind it. After the market collapse of 2018, continuing hacks of corporate crypto exchanges and rampant profiteering, crypto lacked a tool it could truly call its own, Adams wrote in a history of Uniswap. He recounted his thinking at the time:  ""[S]omething felt off in the ether. The major projects on Ethereum embodied some of its properties, but few embraced them fully. Central points of failure, censorable applications and overly complex architecture. Dapps were designed entirely around the idea of having a token for use cases that clearly did not need one.""  Today, Uniswap is one of the largest and most successful DeFi projects, and Adams is reportedly one of the wealthiest founders in the industry. It's the largest decentralized exchange, or DEX, by total value locked (TVL), with over $3.9 billion committed to the platform at writing.  Uniswap Labs has accrued something in the order of $1.5 million in trading fees since flipping that switch on this October, which will help fund ongoing development efforts. This is separate from the protocol fee, which can be turned on in an independent vote among holders of UNI — a protocol token distributed in 2020 in one of the earliest experiments in distributed governance — the could accrue to holders of UNI, but which governance has never voted to turn on.  Its daily trading volumes are commensurate with and often surpass those of Coinbase, the largest U.S. exchange.  To say Adams has influence in crypto is an understatement. He has envy, respect and love. Uniswap may not be his brainchild (Adams credits Gnosis' Alan Lu for the specific swapping mechanism), but he did build it, with significant help along the way. In the beginning, there were people like Floersch and Buterin, of course, but also Pascal Van Hecke, Callil Capuozzo and Uciel Vilchis, who contributed code; friends like Philip Daian, Dan Robinson, Andy Milenius and Jinglan Wang who gave advice and comfort; and financiers like Richard Burton.  Business concessions  Adams also has his controversies. Following the U.S. Treasury Department's sanctioning of Tornado Cash, Uniswap Labs said its supported front end (a.k.a. onramp) onto the protocol would begin censoring addresses that interact with the cryptocurrency mixer – diluting the ""permissionless"" and ""censorship-resistant"" properties that Adams wrote attracted him to Ethereum in the first place.  In June, Uniswap also announced it would soon launch its latest version, V4. This upgrade would come with a number of new features and changes, including a single contract address (called Singleton) that would house all of the pools needed to swap different crypto assets, reducing gas fees for all users. Plus, a new feature called ""hooks"" would allow devs to add code that changes how the protocol acts under different conditions.  Hooks have their haters, with some saying it improves customizability at the expense of decentralization. But the single most controversial aspect of Uniswap V4 is the ""Business Source License"" it'll be released under. The license limits the use of the source code in commercial settings, meaning it isn't exactly open source, at least until the license expires in up to four years.  Indeed, Uniswap, while a revenue generator, also has financial backers. And with financial backers comes an incentive to protect your profits and limit risks. Ethereum has changed since Adams discovered it, in part because of Adams' influence.  The Uniswap team, however, is building the app in public and soliciting advice. There's no official release date for the app, which will require ""Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1153"" to work, as part of Ethereum's Cancun upgrade expected by the end of the year. Such are the realities of open-source development.  CORRECTION (DEC 4, 2023): Fees mentioned in original are new fees that accrue directly to Uniswap Labs, not fees that accrue to UNI token holders.",POSITIVE,UNI,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | UNI,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/hayden-adams-from-ethereum-idealist-to-business-realist-at-uniswap,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/99546e3e54158b20450155d53bd4ef620e217b60-350x350.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Before then, Richard Teng, the man tasked with navigating the company through its next chapter, was little known.  So, who is the man tasked with cleaning up the reputation of the world's biggest crypto company?  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.

Teng then went on to head up the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) within the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), one of the leading international financial centers in the United Arab Emirates, for six years.  He joined Binance in 2021 as CEO of the crypto exchange's Singapore division, quickly rising through the ranks to oversee the Middle East and North Africa region, and later, global markets outside the U.S. Under his leadership, Binance secured its full license within ADGM in November 2022.  In March this year, U.S regulators sought to ban Binance, alleging it had been operating in the country illegally. By November, the exchange pleaded guilty to U.S criminal charges of breaking sanctions and money-transmitting laws, agreeing to pay a $4.3 billion fine. Zhao himself pleaded guilty, agreeing to pay $50m and step down as CEO. Teng's elevation left the crypto world in shock.  Zhao called him a ""highly qualified leader,"" adding that ""he will navigate the company through its next period of growth"".  Teng's appointment as CEO reflects more than a change in leadership; it symbolizes Binance's shift towards a more regulated and compliant future. Teng must steer Binance through immediate challenges, like the U.S. crackdown, and to establish it as a model for regulatory compliance in the crypto industry. (Though, it should be said, no major crypto company is less dependent on U.S. action (and inaction) on crypto matters.)  In his first blog, Teng said he was honored to step into the role, adding that he would focus on reassuring Binance's 150 million users about ""the financial strength, security and safety of the company.""

Now, the tenacious congressman, back from his speaker stint, has reignited his charge for House votes on the bills that would regulate U.S. stablecoin issuers and build comprehensive oversight of the crypto markets. The bowtied chairman of the House Financial Services Committee has made that his mission after having already raised the two bills to unprecedented levels, getting his committee to pass them with bipartisan votes – despite opposition from the panel's senior Democrat.  Pragmatic McHenry is known for his willingness to deal with the other party. For months last year and earlier this year, he negotiated the stablecoin bill with his committee's ranking Democrat, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), and nearly reached a deal before – as he contended – the Biden administration throttled the compromise.  While the next leap for the bills has probably been delayed into 2024, they have a good chance of winning the House's approval, and they'd be the first significant industry legislation to do so.

42391890,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxNBV,1701695520,Analisa Torres: The Judge Who Gave Ripple and XRP Hope,"Federal Judge Analisa Torres gave the crypto industry a shot in the arm last July when she handed Ripple a partial victory in its fight with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  While Ripple violated federal securities law in selling XRP directly to institutional clients, it did not do so by putting XRP on exchanges for retail customers to purchase, Judge Torres found.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  The crypto industry and the SEC have vastly divergent views on how exactly federal securities laws apply to digital assets. In the absence of legislation from Congress that might create so-called bright-lines guidance or build a safe harbor for token issuers and trading platforms alike, the U.S. judiciary system has been tasked with figuring out if the SEC's interpretation is correct – or if companies have a point when they say the laws on the books are outdated and inapplicable.  It's more than just an academic question: If an asset is a security, its issuer is subject to strict disclosure and registration rules in the U.S., rules that crypto companies say are impossible for digital asset issuers to comply with due to the very nature of decentralized, disintermediated tokens. Trading platforms listing those assets are likewise subject to a strict regulatory regime, similar to their traditional finance counterparts. And if an asset is not a security, well, things are a lot easier for all these companies.  Nowhere is this question more pertinent than the District Court for the Southern District of New York, which is currently overseeing nearly a dozen crypto matters, including several cases brought by the SEC. Judge Torres' ruling that Ripple legally had sold and may continue to sell XRP to retail investors through blind bid/ask sales on exchanges has the potential to create a precedent the industry can come back to over and over.  ""Programmatic Buyers could not have known if their payments of money went to Ripple, or any other seller of XRP,"" Judge Torres wrote. ""The vast majority of individuals who purchased XRP from digital asset exchanges did not invest their money in Ripple at all. An Institutional Buyer knowingly purchased XRP directly from Ripple pursuant to a contract, but the economic reality is that a Programmatic Buyer stood in the same shoes as a secondary market purchaser who did not know to whom or what it was paying its money.""  Precedent? It depends  The ruling sent shockwaves through the industry, though it also raised questions about just what sort of precedent it set.  The ruling was ""obviously very beneficial for exchanges in particular,"" said Grant Gulovsen, an attorney who represents crypto clients. But, the extent to which the ruling will benefit crypto companies and projects ""really depends.""  As of this moment, the ruling is in a single courtroom in a single court, and it's clear the SEC intends to appeal it once the overall case has concluded. The regulator has already withdrawn charges against Ripple executives Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen, seemingly in a bid to get to the appeal faster.  ""If [the ruling] is adopted by the court of appeals, it potentially provides a pathway for projects to raise funds,"" Gulovsen said. Judge Torres' ruling may also prove to be an outlier. Another judge in the same court, Judge Jed Rakoff, explicitly rejected Judge Torres' analysis in a summary judgment ruling of his own in the SEC's case against Terraform Labs – though, of course, the circumstances of that ruling are unique to that case, as the circumstances of the Ripple ruling are unique to this case.  Getting an appeals court ruling may take a while. Judge Torres set a schedule for some additional processes that extends through April 2024, and the SEC can't appeal until the case has been resolved.  Until then, at least, it provides ammunition for other crypto companies facing their own legal woes.",POSITIVE,XRP,LUNA | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/analisa-torres-the-judge-who-gave-ripple-and-xrp-hope,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a5147b1c9f4c095ee635574bac953ea4456aa0e3-350x350.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While Solana hasn't yet realized its vision of becoming the ""Nasdaq on the blockchain,"" its strong community of developers has largely refused to quit: only a handful of teams moved to other networks in the past 12 months.  Many Solana users stuck around to enjoy a renaissance of non-Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) activity, and, of course, price rallies. Its SOL token is up over 500% for the year. And major tech improvements are just over the horizon.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  It wasn't too long ago that some would have scoffed at predicting such a bounceback in so little time. Last year, the fast and cheap crypto network was only just recovering from a spate of chain failures when the FTX implosion further rocked the ecosystem.  Beyond its impact on token prices, the downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried's empire also impaired some of the infrastructure at the core of Solana DeFi, like the Serum decentralized exchange (DEX) engine and critical wrapped assets, like soBTC. But the chain and its community persevered.  Ethereum fans still look skeptically at the network and its various tradeoffs. But the label ""VC chain"" didn't stick in a year where venture capital largely steered clear of the entire Solana ecosystem. Still, the network has a long way to go before its comeback can be complete. Solana's total value locked (TVL) – a measurement of the value of all the cryptocurrencies on its decentralized trading venues, lending protocols and staking outposts – is around $690 million.  For instance, as the layer 2 economy continues to grow on Ethereum, which is helping to scale the largest smart contract blockchain but also fragmenting the user experience, more and more influential Ethereum boosters and developers are saying there is a chance ""monolithic"" chains like Solana will dominate.  Yakovenko, too, is gaining greater and greater respect among the wider crypto developer community, in part due to his willingness to engage in critical and constructive dialogue on social media and in podcasts. This year the Solana co-founder took a step forward in his role as a leading voice of the industry and wrote an op-ed in Fortune, arguing for sane digital asset regulation.  The article described his childhood under Soviet rule in Ukraine in brief, his admiration for the U.S. and his fears that a reactive stance against crypto in the country will drive out talent. ""I meet promising entrepreneurs every day who want to build the next great technological innovation in America but don't know how to build a blockchain company in a compliant way,"" he wrote.  Still, Yakovenko and the coterie of committed ecosystem developers continue to build the world over. This year Solana saw the launch of the blockchain-forward Saga phone, announced by Yakovenko, a former operating systems developer at Qualcomm, and got a taste of Firedancer, the upcoming secondary chain client built by trading powerhouse Jump Crypto. Low cost payments in particular is one area where Solana shows promise.  While Solana's improvements largely catered to the network's dedicated fanbase, they have the potential – if successful in 2024 and the years to come – to open Solana up to new casual and power users.",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | SOL | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/solana-sol-anatoly-yakovenko,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/746b4f4591eabc150ac4a7d882196ec6d74cb52f-350x350.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

When the company, one of the largest and most trusted hardware developers in the industry, unveiled a new security feature in May, it ignited a firestorm of criticism.  The idea was simple enough: The Ledger Recover seed phrase recovery service would give ""less rigorous crypto users"" the ability to reclaim their funds if they ever lost access. Essentially, it's a type of ""insurance policy against losing their private keys,"" an issue that plagues crypto.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023.

But due to a mix of misunderstanding, paranoia and hyperbole, many crypto users balked at the program and swore off using the Paris-based firm's products. There are good and bad aspects of the Ledger Recover program. For instance, depending on your view, it's worrisome Ledger could share these ""sharded"" keys (where users and Ledger each keep track) with governments.  However, as a plus, the system would be entirely optional.  In response to the social media backlash – which included videos of people intentionally destroying their hardware wallets – Gauthier posted a long message. It only made things worse. Instead of patiently explaining the system, like who it is aimed at (neophyte users) and why it is a good idea (neophytes lose keys), Gauthier accidentally stoked the fire.  As ex-CoinDesker David Z. Morris wrote at the time: ""The offending comment seems to simultaneously affirm all of the worst fears being floated – and also belittle the worriers for not catching on sooner. Regardless of intent, both 'technically speaking' and 'whether you knew it or not' will be heard as condescending, even dismissive.""  Ledger temporarily called off releasing Ledger Recover but in a sign of it being a good idea (and the company knowing it), it waited to roll it out towards the end of the year.  In the long run, the whole spectacle may end up in Ledger's favor, even if many people are still boycotting the company. It was also, invariably, a good thing for the industry as a whole, as is any time the importance of safeguarding secret keys and passphrases becomes a popular topic of conversation.  For Gauthier, the powerful reaction will likely inform his decisions and public communications for the rest of his days. For instance, when announcing layoffs this October affecting 12% of Ledger's global workforce, he penned a long, thought-provoking message that only partook in a little of the corporate, PR sugarcoating you could usually expect when a company has bad news to share.  ""Have we been perfect in all matters? No. We have made mistakes along the way. To fail is part of the process. But I sincerely believe the positive outweighs the negative and that we will come out of this bear market stronger together,"" he wrote.  Ledger has had some ups as well, this year. It closed a $100 million funding round and kept its $1.5 billion valuation (at a time when many raises, if they happened at all, were down rounds, or deals struck at lower valuations than prior deals). Ledger says it has sold 6.5 million of its nano wallets and has hundreds of institutional clients and the responsibility of ""securing more than 20% of global crypto assets.""  Gauthier joined Ledger in 2015 as a board member, when it was still in its startup phase. A year later, he became chief operating officer and then president after another roll of the calendar. In 2020, he was promoted to his current positions of chairman and CEO.  Earlier in his career, the French national, born in 1976, led a sales division and then served as commercial director at Dooyoo AG. He became a director at Yahoo after the tech giant acquired a different European startup he was working at called Kelkoo. And he rose through the ranks at French streaming company Criteo, becoming COO.  In 2014, Gauthier founded Kaiko, which was originally named Challenger Deep (inspired by the deep sea submarine that explored the Mariana Trench). He's also had advisory roles at crypto startups OpenX and Index Ventures, among others, and established a joint venture between Ledger, Japanese bank Nomura and asset manager Coinshares called ""Komainu,"" which is exploring blockchain use cases.  As a preeminent crypto executive in the European Union, Gauthier also helped steer the groundbreaking policy known as MiCA, the first regulatory ruleset of its kind.  1. Achievement:  Personal: fundraising in a tough market at the beginning of 2023, raising $100 million and retaining our $1.5 billion valuation.  For Ledger: showing focus, resilience and professionalism. The company and the team kept building in 2023 despite tough market conditions. We prepared for the bull market that's yet to come, with a real display of resilience, professionalism and focus.  2. 2024 Goal: to bring a new device to market.  3. Prediction: The industry will start witnessing a new wave of adoption led by real user needs, not just related to market price fluctuations. It will be a cycle of adoption and consumer usage will be the story of the next bull cycle. Teams like Ledger have been building through the bear market for the bull, and we're seeing the reality that more people will continue to use self-custody. More people will own crypto away from centralized exchanges, and experience the true benefits of digital ownership. Let's never forget that is why crypto exists in the first place: to enable anyone to gain full control over their personal value.

By publicly declaring a floor price for FTT, FTX's exchange token, Ellison contributed to a sequence of events that ultimately led to FTT's price tanking, FTX and Alameda filing for bankruptcy and Ellison testifying against her former boss, and boyfriend, in court.  The Stanford University graduate and former Jane Street trader took the stand in mid-October to tell a federal judge, jury and members of the public that she committed fraud, laundered money and conspired to defraud FTX's customers and investors, and Alameda's lenders.  And to be clear, those crimes ""were committed with Sam.""  Taking the stand  Ellison, who was raised Catholic, was a star witness in one of the biggest fraud cases to ever go to trial. She took the stand three days in a row, and gave testimony about how she was an integral member of a four-person team who took money that didn't belong to them, and spent it primarily to gamble, purchase real estate and influence U.S. elections and regulations.  She sobbed (briefly). She was discussing emotional things. Like the weight of a multi-billion dollar fraud lifting, when FTX finally crumpled, and falling in love with a dismissive, emotionally manipulative man, who suffers from depression and anhedonia. He told her once she could never make him happy, that nothing could, and yet she tried.  Meet Michael Kutsche, the artist who created the NFT image of Caroline Ellison for Most Influential 2023.  Ellison was just one of many witnesses in the biggest trial crypto has seen, but her role as one of FTX's public faces – perhaps the second-best known after Sam himself – drew the second-largest crowd to the courthouse in lower Manhattan.  At Alameda, he was regularly updating balance sheets and knew fully well whether the trading firm could repay its lenders at any time, she said. By mid-June 2022, the answer was no.  ""I was in sort of a constant state of dread at that point,"" she said when describing her mental state at the time. ""I knew that we would have to take the money from our FTX line of credit and I knew that that was money that could be called at any time, and every day, I mean, I was worrying about the possibility of customer withdrawals from FTX and the possibility of this getting out and what would happen to people that would be hurt by that.""  But it's still Sam  Ellison and Bankman-Fried met at Jane Street, a Wall Street quant fund that only accepts the brightest. She was considering a one-year master's degree program in math, but was persuaded to join Sam's private venture, which she knew little about. She didn't know anything about crypto at the time. She was one of Alameda's first hires, one of a few with trading experience. She called it a ""lateral"" move.  When DeFi Summer (2020) happened, those hazy days when random (often food-related, for some reason) protocols printed yield, when interest rates everywhere else were nil, she learned how to use the MetaMask wallet. Her trades, infamously, relied on ""elementary school math"" and gut.  Later on, when things were turning south, Sam chided her for not ""hedging."" She told him there was a 100% chance they'd go broke if he started a venture fund; she did the math, she later said in court. He started a venture fund.  Her co-CEO, the better risk manager, she said, had checked out mentally, long before he officially left in August 2021. His name was also Sam. He bought a boat and named it ""Soak My Deck."" It remains a mystery where Sam Trabucco is today, or why he wasn't at the trial. As effective altruists, Bankman-Fried and his entourage all believed in ""earning to give,"" and practiced it like a religion. But the group's code of ethics had no answer to whether it is wrong to steal. It depends, their prophets likely would have said. Did you calculate the expected value?  They all communed with their prophets. Sam, not the one with the yacht, just a plane, thought he could be president. He had a 5% chance, he said. What were they thinking?  It's easy to imagine Ellison alone, in that Bahamian penthouse with nine roommates including Bankman-Fried. Stimulants, his and her gas, can be isolating. It's rumored they all got prescriptions to focus. Bankman-Fried kept odd hours, and would take a call from anyone at seemingly any time. He shakes.  The story of Ellison is inextricably wrapped up with the story of Bankman-Fried. Much of the public narrative about her centers around her role at Alameda – except for conversations about the Tumblr blog she (allegedly) posted on or the tweets.  Though she was officially the one in charge of Alameda at one point, and was the one tracking the books, she testified in court how she wasn't really in charge of anything. She didn't even have equity in Alameda, unlike her fellow inner circle members.  Early on in her time at Alameda, she said, her duties included ""a variety of things; everything from doing research and working on our trading models to monitoring automated systems to moving things like Bitcoin around the different exchanges.""  With Sam now facing potentially decades in prison, compared to her own likely much lighter sentence, there's a chance for her story to change.",NEGATIVE,FTT,BTC | EXCHANGE | TRADING | RESEARCH | FTT,"Daniel Kuhn, Nikhilesh De",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/caroline-ellison-buried-sam-bankman-fried,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fa9f5f6ed15c8764165b19f85c67cd0b09cef171-1080x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42391899,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxNgH,1701695300,Ogle Catches the Crypto Crooks,"Hacks happen. And in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), hacks happen a lot. Ogle, who goes by @cryptogle on X (formerly Twitter) and ogle.eth on-chain, is one of a number of people attempting to professionalize the industry of recovering funds. So far, according to his website, Ogle has helped to recover more than $350 million from crypto protocol exploits.  Ogle shows up where he's needed. He's on Crypto Twitter, of course, as well as Discord, Telegram and in ENS messages. He has a team of researchers at Ogle Security Group, who he pays out of pocket. And, he's part of a less official group of Web3 natives who often help to track down moving funds, including Alicia Katz, samczsun and ZachXTB.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here. Ogle is a speaker at CoinDesk's Consensus 2024 festival, May 29-31, in Austin, Texas.  Not much is known about Ogle's civilian life. He calls himself a tech native and has founded and led a few Web2 firms, where he picked up knowledge of security best practices. He declined to name which ones, though he said one was a ""household name."" Today, he's inventing best practices for negotiating with crypto criminals: he's the guy who came up with the 10% figure that keeps popping up during conversations with hackers, return 90% to the protocol and walk away with the rest.  He's helped recover funds in some of the largest hacks to date: Euler, Alchemix and, currently, is negotiating with the KyberSwap hacker. The most ""complex"" was Curve, which involved four different companies and potentially four different exploiters. Ogle is also building a security-focused blockchain, called Glue, ""to try to solve some of the commonly exploited problems at the chain layer,"" he said in a text message interview.  As a kid, he said, he was part of a group called CyberArmy, a ""white hat"" (pen testers for the greater good), which was founded in the late 90s. In a recent episode of the ""Unchained"" podcast, he also mentions having a skillset honed by Web1 (back then it was called the ""information superhighway""), though that could have been an attempt as misdirection.  ""When I was a kid I was constantly trying to break into things and deconstruct systems, but without any malicious intent whatsoever. Not every hacker is malicious. They're usually just very curious and perhaps don't follow rules very well,"" he said via text. In a Cointelegraph video interview he said learned a lot about the cyber world and its denizens by studying hacking and cracking with the longview of trying to stop ""bullies.""  It's a moral code that doesn't always square with the law, or with expectations. There isn't much justice, for instance, in derailing a young kid's life by dropping a dime on them. And while he often offers his services free-of-charge, the line of work is often thankless. He can spend hours, days or weeks in negotiation with a hacker, only for the DAO or protocol dev team who gets their money (or their users' money) back to ghost him.  Worse, many ""promise and never deliver"" a bounty; he said it happens more than you would think. Though Ogle also has a paid service used for ""slightly more formal work"" on hacks. It costs $6,500/month to have him on-call in case things break. It's also a way to separate funds and legal liability, a first step to professionalizing the industry.  There would be a fleet of Ogles in the world, he said, if the industry could work out the funding model. Right now, people who spot exploits are incentivized to break, enter and steal rather than disclose — you may get caught, but you have a better chance of getting paid. He might consider hiring the truly ""exceptional"" for Ogle Security.  He's made appearances, and often played a starring role, in negotiations with hackers for years. He lost count of exactly how many; it's around 40. He breaks the job up into two parts, asset recovery, or ""using blockchain analytics and law-enforcement approved negotiation techniques"" to regain stolen funds, and crisis communications, where he helps impacted teams calm their communities.  The best thing DeFi protocols can do, he said, is get a real audit. An actual one. The next best thing is to come up with a game plan for a hack, in case the worst happens. And when it does, keep cool. Profile the suspect, keep track of the funds on-chain and communicate with the community.  Even old protocols can be at risk. In late November, one of the oldest decentralized exchanges, KyberSwap, was nearly flushed clean. Ogle called it one of the most sophisticated hacks he's ever seen. It had to be. It was an exploit that went unexploited forever.  See also: Calling a Hack an Exploit Minimizes Human Error | Opinion  Ogle can't talk much about the Kyber attack while negotiations are ongoing. The hacker started off on a strong footing: total control over Kyber the company and ""temporary full authority and ownership"" over KyberDAO.  There has to be some honor among thieves  There's usually a type, a psychological profile of a hacker: young, smart and hungry, and usually under 25 years old and living in Asia. Sometimes, after the negotiation is over, they remain friends. ""I'm the only one that knows, sometimes,"" he said, adding that they can't tell their friends or family. By staying in touch, he learns more about the mentality of The Common Crypto Crook, aiding future recoveries.  ""Discussions don't usually go wrong,"" he said. ""The goal is to be fair to everyone involved, and most attackers realize that what's being offered is a better outcome for them."" It beats the looming fear of persecution and disclosure that may follow a hacker to the grave, and nowadays with most crypto exchanges trying to stay above the law it's becoming harder and harder to cash out.  How exactly did he get this job?  It started with StableMagnet, a decentralized protocol that offered significantly higher returns than rival lenders like Aave. I bet you can guess where this is going: It was a rug. People's ""hard earned money,"" gone. Ogle viewed it as an opportunity. Harder to guess: doing a little sleuthing and making a few calls led to what is commonly discussed as the first ever DeFi hack recovery. It was the first of many monumental occurances.  ""The money was returned by the police in Manchester, U.K. in USDT. So they [the bobbies] acknowledged theft of crypto and paid it back in a different crypto coin than was stolen, which was in my view a governmental acknowledgement of crypto as 'money.'""  He found a username, a clue. Then a Github account. Then other Github accounts they were connected to and connect those to actual humans and find similarities between them, like where they went to school. He found their friends, girlfriends and family and then went to the school registrar. They were in Hong Kong.  He contacted them on Signal, WhatsApp and Telegram. They didn't want to play ball.  After he reached out directly, they fled to England — it was two and half years ago, in the midst of the COVID pandemic, and England was one of the few places they could fly to from Hong Kong. Ogle figured they were smart, that they knew only idiots would go to London, so he started calling hotels in Manchester, where the hackers would have to stay during a 10-day quarantine.  He pretended to be a family member, asking if the hotel had a guest of a certain name. Eventually, he hears, ""I'm not allowed to say if we have a guest by that name, but, if we do, I'll take the message and I'll give it to them and if they happen to be here you know you know they'll they'll have the message,"" he said, putting on a British accent.  ""I'm like, Bingo."" He calls the police; he doesn't like bringing in law enforcement unless he needs to. He's turned down work before because his clients said they intend to call the FBI, after he's promised a hacker they'd be safe if they return the funds. ""There has to be some honor among thieves,"" he said.

42391889,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxN6N,1701695270,Miguel Morel: Shining a Light on Crypto's Leaky Pseudonymity,"There has long been a push-and-pull between transparency and privacy in the crypto industry. On one hand, Bitcoin's first users were cypherpunks and cryptographers who have long been concerned about financial privacy – drawn to the blockchain's pseudonymity provided through alphanumeric addresses. On the other: everything is public by default on-chain, and many boosters praise crypto as a way to usher in a more ""transparent"" economy.  It was precisely this tension that CEO Miguel Morel sought to exploit when founding Arkham Intelligence, a popular (and mostly free!) blockchain analytics platform that launched in beta late last year.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  Arkham is one of a number of on-chain analytics software companies, like rivals Chainalysis and Elliptic, that are loved and hated in equal measure. These firms are often criticized for the work they do to explicate data, thereby often revealing identities and information that some people would rather keep hidden, for corporations and governments. At the same time, these intelligence gathers provide crypto users with useful info – helping to dispel myths like the idea that blockchains are often abused by criminals and terrorists, and tracking down hackers.  This year, Morel tried to take blockchain analysis one step further into crypto – causing more controversy for an already controversial company. Over the summer, Arkham launched what it called the Intel Exchange, a token-powered system that would enable people to earn crypto (""intel bounties"") for providing valuable information that helped identify wallets. It also allowed users to anonymously buy and sell information, using smart contracts, on the identities of any crypto wallet address.  The reaction was intense, with many calling the new scheme a ""snitch-to-earn"" or ""dox-to-earn"" system (a play on the ""play-to-earn"" revenue models in Web3 gaming). Many raised concerns that the Intel Exchange could be used to ""attack"" or target people, doxx the innocent and just generally degrade privacy in the industry. Others began to speculate the platform, which raised over $12 million, including from investors like Peter Thiel and Sam Altman, who both founded data companies that work with the U.S. government, was a CIA project.  Morel felt misunderstood.  The Bay Area transplant from Philly was also ready to fight. He took to Twitter to defend the Intel Exchange and Arkham, making the case that much of the information used to label wallets that could now be bought and sold was already widely discussed among crypto sleuths. ""The Intel Exchange is creating a liquid market for it so that on-chain researchers can more easily monetize their work and exchange information,"" he said at the time.  Moreover, ""no other personal information"" was being offered.  Amid the fury, other claims about Arkham were also raised. Apparently, in preparation of the planned token sale, Arkham launched a referral program that may have revealed user's email addresses, many speculated. DL News reported that Arkham was aware of the data leak as early as January, but only addressed the concerns following the uproar of its data exchange.  ""Criticism birthed by speculation about our use cases have vanished,"" Morel said in an interview with CoinDesk this weekend. ""We've had a track record of success since going live and the Intel Exchange has proven positive for the industry as a means of incentivizing on-chain sleuths to uncover information that helps the community at large.""  There is a case to be made that companies like Arkham and Chainalyis, though controversial, have a singularly positive impact on crypto. Chainalysis, for instance, was founded in the aftermath of the massive Mt. Gox breach to help find the hackers and recover funds. Although many BitcoinTalk users at the time considered bitcoin to be ""privacy-preserving,"" and were angry that the company was created even for seemingly altruistic reasons, there is a real argument that in the long run, it's better to be completely aware that blockchain pseudonymity can (and likely will) be compromised.  So it is with Arkham's data brokerage. The lesson being that when it comes to privacy and transparency there are always trade-offs.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | ARKM | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/miguel-morel-shining-a-light-on-cryptos-leaky-pseudonymity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/afa9bf5e92a62acda0dab228430c9a138e716faf-350x350.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Crypto and the wider world of open-source, distributed tech has social media alternatives, too. There’s Bluesky, Blockstack, DeSo, Farcaster, Friend.Tech, Gab, Hive, Lens, Lenster, Mastodon, Minds, Mirror, NOSTR, Steemit and many, many more. There were apps that launched this year, and apps that upgraded, revamped or overhauled.  Some, like Mastodon, have seen such an influx of users that the platform is essentially unrecognizable from this time last year. Others, particularly those on a blockchain, are not quite sure if they could even scale to the hundreds of millions to billions of users that log into, post on and love Twitter, Facebook and Instagram today.  It was the year of decentralized social media. Here are a quick selection of notable moments.  Friend.Tech  In September, Friend.tech, the buzzy blockchain-backed chat room protocol, spiked to $1 million in daily revenues, technically beating out Uniswap, the largest decentralized exchange. Friend.tech saw immediate traction after launching in August. It was built by a pseudonymous developer known as Racer and the rest of the team that built Stealcam, a gamified NFT art project and social experiment.  The app, built on Coinbase’s Base network, is notable for its relatively painless onboarding experience but launched in invite-only mode. It picked up notoriety for weekly rewards airdrops to users (throughout a planned six-month beta period, friend.tech will airdrop a total of 100 million “points”), as well as the ability to buy and sell “keys” (originally “shares”) in profiles. The app also became home to a number of OnlyFans content creators.  Meet EFDOT, the artist who created the image of Racer, the co-founder of Friend.tech.  “We initially shared the app to start load testing and didn’t expect it to go viral,” Friend.tech co-founder Racer told Decrypt in August. “So we’re doing a bit of catch-up.” A funny thing to say, in retrospect: They didn’t expect a financialized social media app to go viral, but that’s what financialized and social media apps do.  Farcaster  Farcaster is one of a few Twitter clones that seems to have a life of its own. While it only counts a little more than 10,000 users, including Vitalik Buterin, the app is undoubtedly one of crypto’s most notable social media phenomena. Anytime someone asks if there are “good decentralized social media” protocols yet, it will be mentioned, usually more than once.  This year, the app — being built primarily by two ex-Coinbasers, Dan Romero and Varun Srinivasan — saw two notable updates. First the project migrated to the OP Mainnet, an Ethereum layer 2 that uses scalable optimistic rollups. More recently, Farcaster opened its doors out of “invite only” to become fully permissionless.  “We’re excited to announce that our social network, Farcaster, is 100% permissionless,” Romero posted on X. “Anyone with an internet connection and some ether can sign up and use the network.”  Lens  Aave founder Stani Kulechov’s swing at social networking called Lens also took a step forward towards becoming permissionless. In early-November, the sister app to one of the largest decentralized lenders, announced it launched its version two (V2) introducing the most significant user monetization features yet in Web3 social media.  Kulechov described Lens V2 as ""more modular,"" meaning users have ""greater autonomy and flexibility"" in their social media experiences. This includes a pay-to-read feature, tipping, subscribing and donating, with potentially more revenue avenues available later.  The app also added a feature that seems to have DAOs in mind: the ability for “profiles” to be managed by more than one person.  A lot can change in a year, and decentralized social media is just getting going.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | AIRDROP,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/the-year-of-decentralized-social-media,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d6ece1d4c73bc7bd1cce32651dc926f7e951168f-1080x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42391900,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxNlP,1701695223,Paul Sztorc: Scaling Bitcoin With Sidechains,"When I get through to Paul Sztorc on Zoom recently, it's clear immediately that he's frustrated. Not frustrated in an angry way – he's genial and friendly on the line, and our conversation is fascinating. Sztorc is a brilliant Bitcoin developer and he has a thrilling vision of Bitcoin reaching across the entire world and really becoming the backbone of the next stage of civilization. But he's frustrated, troubled even. And I feel for him a little.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  This year, Sztorc has been selling the Bitcoin community on BIP 300, a proposal to scale Bitcoin using ""drivechains"" (or sidechains) that allow transfers of assets between the main chain and secondary blockchains with minimal changes to Bitcoin's main code. Sztorc says BIP 300 can bring a bevy of great features to Bitcoin, including improved privacy, more tokens and smart contracts, at no risk to Bitcoin's bedrock principles of decentralization and censorship resistance. But many in the Bitcoin community aren't having it.  BIP 300, which revises an idea first posted in 2017, was met with fierce opposition from prominent Bitcoiners such as Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy), Saifedean Ammous (""The Bitcoin Standard""), Pierre Rochard (Riot Blockchain) and Cory Klippsten (Swan Bitcoin) this year. And Sztorc is clearly peeved. He thinks his proposals are a sensible way to achieve greater network effects while not disturbing what makes Bitcoin uniquely Bitcoin. He says these critics suffer from a kind of ""group think.""  Sidechains could allow developers to build permissionlessly on top of the main network, importing new functionality while validating side networks using Bitcoin's enormous hashpower. ""It's about having a procedural process in the protocol for leaving and going to a different piece of software [off the main network]. This returns competition to software development,"" Sztorc said.  Sztorc, 34, said approvals of soft forks, which introduce new features to Bitcoin without undermining previous versions of the blockchain, are becoming less frequent these days, even though many of the proposed changes are relatively small-bore.  ""There is nothing controversial about any of the soft forks currently proposed,"" he said. ""No one has a problem with the content. It's all a lie. It's just a fake thing where everyone is afraid to say the truth. It's too much groupthink. I hope to represent destroying the groupthink.""  ""Hard money"" Bitcoiners, who see Bitcoin's main purpose as an anti-inflation hedge, tend to be resistant to changes in the code, lest they lead to a dilution of Bitcoin's decentralization and self-sustaining durability. Michael Saylor, who has invested hundreds of millions in Bitcoin the asset, thinks Bitcoin is a finished product that doesn't need to be amended.  ""It's good enough to be a hundred-trillion-dollar base layer. It's good enough to be 200x bigger than it is. It's good enough to be a $500 trillion base layer,"" the MicroStrategy CEO said this year.  Sztorc, who grew up near New Haven, Connecticut, said this point of view banishes innovation that would make Bitcoin better. In our Zoom, he lists half a dozen other projects that would have offered greater functionality, had they been approved. Sztorc thinks innovators are being frozen out. He points, for example, to how another proposal, BIP 119, was shot down in 2022, with its proponent Jeremy Rudin choosing to leave Bitcoin development entirely.  ""They're a small minority, but they're very vocal,"" said Sztorc of the conservative voices against changes to Bitcoin's direction.  With a market cap of $814 billion and 460 million wallet holders around the world, Bitcoin still reigns supreme in the world of crypto. Bitcoin, the asset, has a more than 50% market share and, to the wider public, Bitcoin is crypto, and vice versa. Still, according to Sztorc, we should worry about Bitcoin ossifying into a single use-case ""digital gold"" project.  ""I just think that we need to scale to eight billion people,"" Sztorc told CoinDesk. ""If we can't do that, we're turning some people away. And then no one wants to do that. Everyone wants to be on the same network that everyone else is on. The network effects are too strong. The scalable one will win.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | ZRX | FORKS,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/paul-sztorc-scaling-bitcoin-with-sidechains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a18476450efc51513f517c87cebbe6c180bea7d7-350x350.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42391895,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxNW1,1701695201,Balaji Put His Money Where His Mouth Was,"Balaji Srinivasan (often just Balaji) probably won't like hearing this, but he's part of the media. Last year, Srinivasan, a bio-science entrepreneur turned Silicon Valley mogul, wrote a book that was this year's topic of conversation.  ""The Network State,"" published independently and available for free online, makes the case that online communities can coalesce to operate a bit like countries. It's an advancement of a theory Srinivasan has been putting forward for years: that today's dominant institutions are eroding from the inside, as power and influence becomes increasingly distributed through network technologies (i.e. the internet, social media, cryptocurrency, etc.).  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  Amid a banking crisis in early 2023, Srinivasan took a highly publicized bet that the U.S. dollar was teetering on collapse. Within 90 days, he wagered, with $1 million on the line and left-leaning economist James Medlock taking the other side, that bitcoin (then worth less than $30,000) would be worth $1 million.  See also: Peter McCormack – Balaji Srinivasan's $1M Bitcoin Bet Could Be Right, but I Hope He's Wrong  For better or worse, but mostly for the better, Srinivasan was wrong and the U.S. dollar did not enter into hyperinflation. When the bet settled in May, bitcoin was down roughly 3% since the day he made his prediction, and indicators signaled that the Federal Reserve had begun to cool an overheated economy.  As is often said of Donald Trump, many took Srinivasan's bet literally but not seriously when perhaps it should have been the other way around. He explained at Consensus 2023 that he saw just a 10% chance of a ""fiat crisis"" happening in months, a 70% probability of it happening in years, 19% in decades and 1% in centuries. Even 10% was high enough to his mind to sound alarm bells; betting a nontrivial amount of money was a ""costly signal"" he was not crying wolf. Angel investor Julie Fredrickson suggested Srinivasan was trying to widen the Overton window, the range of ideas it is acceptable to discuss.  And Srinivasan has been right about big things before. Most notably, in early 2020 he rang the alarm that the novel coronavirus blazing through China could become a global crisis, at a time when many people were either unaware of the risks or calling it bigoted to take safety precautions.  It was a prediction that caused a tussle between Srinivasan and ""the media,"" which he saw (and still sees) as a monolithic institution that is woefully inept and complicit with the powers that be. That fight has an even earlier origin, and has been a favored topic of his for about a decade – ever since he gave a controversial lecture, ""Silicon Valley's Ultimate Exit,"" in 2013.  While critical of mainstream currents, Srinivasan is a believer in communication. He went on countless podcasts this year to promote ""The Network State,"" so many that there's a joke following him around where he's asked if an hour is enough for him to make his point. Srinivasan can speak at length extemporaneously, and is generous with his time.  Whether or not you agree with them, Srinivasan's ideas have spread, particularly in the California-based tech scene he left behind to live in Singapore. Some are philosophical (like how people of different abilities and temperaments naturally sort themselves online), others practical – like the importance of controlling your money, via crypto, and using privacy-preserving tools, such as the Signal messaging services.  He also advocates, for instance, in ""going direct"" by disseminating information via your own or friendly channels, and taking a code of silence in speaking to journalists. Another figure on CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023 list, a compadre of Srinivasan's, refused to speak on the record for their write-up, in part influenced by Srinivasan's views of the media. (For the record: Srinivasan did agree to participate in the Q&A below.)  Publicist and influencer Ed Zitron said the stereotypical tech bro's distrust of the press might come from a ""change of tech coverage from enthusiast to industry-focused,"" meaning a greater level of ""scrutiny."" It is possible both sides – ""tech"" and ""the media"" – have the wrong perception of each other.  But Balaji's war is bigger than just butting heads with the hundreds of thousands of scribblers that comprise the media.

We mainstreamed the concept of starting new countries with 40+ speakers including famous people like [Glenn] Greenwald, Vitalik [Buterin], Garry Tan and Anatoly [Yakovenko] – as well as the not-yet-famous founders of a dozen plus startup societies from around the world like Culdesac, Prospera and Cabin.  Some tweets so you can see how packed it was:  What's your No. 1 goal for 2024?  If the apotheosis of AI is to build a new god, the apotheosis of crypto is to build a new state. Towards that end, I feel I've helped lay down some of the initial concepts over the last 18 months. Now, I want to turn the network state into a more structured global movement, with defined progress metrics.  Please give us a prediction for crypto next year.  The only thing more important than starting new currencies is starting new cities and countries.

42391893,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxNLl,1701695064,Yat Siu: The Metaverse Man Gets Real,"""Web3 is much more than cryptocurrency,"" Yat Siu, the co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands, said on stage at this year's TED2023 conference. It was a message they may not have wanted to hear.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Siu said he encountered a skeptical audience – many of whom thought the metaverse was Facebook. ""It was probably the most difficult talk,"" he said, describing his first – and hopefully not last – TED experience.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here. Yat Sui is a speaker at CoinDesk's Consensus 2024 festival, May 29-31, in Austin, Texas.  2023 was a volatile year, to put it mildly, but Animoca Brands, a Hong Kong-based Web3 gaming giant, continued to invest, build and educate. That is why Yat Siu, the firm's public face and lead investor, is on the most influential list for the second year in a row.  Purpose mission impact  In 2023, Animoca Brands, which was valued at $5.9 billion in a bull market of 2022, transformed from an investment-focused firm to an investment and education-focused firm. Animoca opened a space for Web3 education, joining the Web3 global educators fund by Open Campus Protocol. The company continued to expand into the Middle East, Japan and other parts of the world, to show people that there is a thriving world of Web3 outside the United States and Europe.  By 2023, Animoca Brands' portfolio has expanded to 450 projects and brands. ""We are becoming much more than a gaming company,"" Siu said. The company has over 2,700 shareholders, and functions a little like a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), he said.  Siu believes that working with governments this year has been among the biggest transitions for him and the company. ""If there was no fraud and everything was working fine in 2022, we would probably not be working as closely as we are today with governments and regulators,"" Siu said. ""We were not going to necessarily play a leading role. That's changed.""  He is still an active Web3 investor but plays more of a role in education and lobbying. ""Not like those companies in the U.S., they became very quiet and very cautious, we did the opposite,"" he said.  Although Animoca cut its target for new fundraise this year, the company raised $20 million to expand its Web3 identity project Mocaverse. In the middle of this year, Animoca planned to shift focus away from U.S, markets following the Security and Exchange Commission's clampdown on crypto.  The company acquired Web3 streaming platform Azarus to scale up metaverse gaming, joined the Chiliz network to boost its ""SportFi"" ecosystem and invested in a Hong Kong-based crypto startup exchange Hi.  Siu sees the year ahead as a year for many existing and emerging verticals in crypto, like GameFi, EduFi and digital identity. In other words, these are the places where crypto intersects with the real world, where financial technology and blockchain can reinject healthy competition, align incentives and foster collaboration.  Animoca also partnered with Saudi Arabia in a $50 million deal to bring Web3 to NEOM, the futurist desert city under construction. This followed Animoca's partnership with Japan-based trading firm Mitsui to create a new Web3 business in Japan.  Being hungry  Siu was appointed to Hong Kong Task Force on Web3 development when Hong Kong is aiming to build a Web3 hub. ""We are not going to get mass adoption if the governments are not comfortable with Web3,"" he said. He believes that Hong Kong's strength will always be the fact it has been the independent financial hub.  Some would argue that investing in Hong Kong is risky because Beijing is not friendly to cryptocurrency. But according to Siu, ""Everything comes with risks, we understand that we are pushing new boundaries, and I would argue that is far less risky for us in Hong Kong than some of our friends in America right now.""  ""Hong Kong is hungry, which Hong Kong has not been for a long time,"" he said, adding that ""nothing is forever, you have to fight for it.""

It was a post pioneered by her current colleague at Castle Island, Nic Carter, who was Fidelity's first dedicated bitcoin analyst.  Before Fidelity, Bhutoria was a senior analyst at Circle Research, where she wrote weekly roundups about the state of the industry. She would occasionally also write longer reports zooming into advancements in narrow topics like zero knowledge technology and multi-party computation (well before ZK-anything or MPC were popular topics).

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  The price of bitcoin [BTC] climbed above $42,000 – a level not seen since before the crash of Terra – for the first time since April 2022 while ether [ETH] moved past $2,200. Bitcoin’s price had been toying with the $40,000 level in recent days, and finally breached it Monday to trade above $41,600 as of press time, according to CoinDesk Indices data, a 24-hour rise of about 6%. Ether was trading around $2,240, a similar percentage gain. The advance spurred crypto stocks higher, too. Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) jumped almost 9% in pre-market trading, as did Microstrategy (MSTR). Crypto miners such as Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot (RIOT) added more than 10%. The other top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization marked smaller gains, and BNB coin (BNB), a token affiliated with the Binance exchange, was little changed.  Crypto asset manager Grayscale has hired Invesco's former Head of Americas, John Hoffman, to lead its distribution and partnerships team, six weeks before a decision is set to come out on whether the company will be allowed to launch a spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded-fund (ETF). Hoffman – an ETF veteran – spent over 17 years at investment manager Invesco, first as the director of ETF institutional sales and capital markets at Invesco PowerShares Capital Management, before moving into an adviser role and most recently, leading the Americas, ETF and indexed strategies team.  Lawmakers in the U.K. are asking the government to consider lowering holding limits for a potential digital pound and make sure its design won’t block the possibility of paying interest. Both the U.K. and its 27-nation neighbor, the European Union, have said in proposals that retail digital currencies should not be allowed to earn interest as bank deposits do. In a report published Saturday, U.K. legislators in the Treasury Committee of the House of Commons – the lower chamber of Parliament – expressed their concerns about the U.K.’s plans for a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in a February consultation. The government has said a digital pound was “likely needed” in the future.

42391932,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxaFt,1701695022,"Mike Belshe, the Crypto Custody King at BitGo","BitGo, one of the largest custody specialists in the digital asset industry, celebrated its 10-year anniversary this year. It is an incumbent, it is an institution and it is led by CEO Mike Belshe.  The company was one of a few to raise capital in a depressed market this year, and even more significantly, it raised at an elevated valuation – $1.75 billion – at a time when most crypto companies were being reevaluated down.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  At the time, in mid-August, Belshe said the firm would use the $100 million Series C capital to accelerate its acquisitions and global expansion plans. Since then, BitGo has bought wealth management platform HeightZero, formed a ""bitcoin-only trust company"" with Swan and finalized a strategic pact with Korean TradFi heavyweight Hana Bank.  ""There's going to be consolidation in the space over the next six months,"" Belshe said in an interview with CoinDesk TV's First Mover in June.  That statement was made in a moment of rebirth for the organization. Months earlier publicly traded blockchain giant Galaxy Digital (GLXY.TO) canceled its $1.2 billion acquisition of BitGo, citing concerns over the custodian's ""audited financial statements for 2021,"" a BitGo statement read. The reneged deal thrust BitGo and Galaxy into months of litigation, centered around a $100 million termination fee.  It may have been a lucky break, as Belshe noted the firm has not had trouble finding backers. The experience also likely informed the company's own decision to back out of a buyout that would have saved the troubled rival custodian Prime Trust.  ""In the wake of growing global economic uncertainty, we will continue to see a flight to safety. BitGo is well-positioned to meet this demand. We are leading the way to provide wallet and market structure solutions this industry needs for this cycle and future cycles,"" Belshe said in an email interview.  It's known that BitGo is a dominant custodian, which counts over 1,500 clients globally including Nike, 150 crypto exchanges and other companies spanning 50+ countries. BitGo also claims to process 20% of all on-chain bitcoin transactions. The company also launched its Go Network this year, a settlement and market structure system for institutions.  Belshe, a graduate of California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo with a degree in computer science, had a storied career prior to BitGo. As an engineer, he made significant contributions to the SPDY and HTTP/2.0 systems, communication protocols and specifications that make the modern internet run.  Like many of his Silicon Valley contemporaries, Belshe started his career at Hewlett-Packard, which at the time housed one of the most august research hubs. He then worked at Netscape, the startup that developed the first web browser and was one of the early hires on the Google Chrome team, among other jobs. Belshe also worked on the influential Internet Engineering Task Force that set standards for the internet.  Belshe has also developed an ethos of open-source development and collaboration at BitGo. The company helped architect the multi-signature wallet design, which serves as the security backbone for many crypto companies and decentralized projects and helped pioneer the ""threshold signature scheme"" that makes the buzzy field of multi-party computation (MPC) even more secure.  Always a leading voice within the crypto industry, this year Belshe began to speak out and write about the need for sane regulations and industry ethics. In several CoinDesk op-eds, for instance, he has advocated for a separation of custodial and trading operations at crypto exchanges.  A Q&A with Mike Belshe  CoinDesk: What was your biggest achievement this past year?  Mike Belshe: BitGo experienced substantial growth by expanding our product offerings while maintaining a strong regulatory position as the world's largest independent regulated custodian. The launch of the Go Network provides a new market structure for institutions to settle efficiently. BitGo serves as one of the world's largest staking providers offering staking out of qualified custody and fiat services. We also celebrated a decade in the industry and achieved further validation with a $100 million Series C funding round at a $1.75 billion valuation.  CD: What's your No. 1 goal for 2024?  MB: Broadening our global regulatory footprint - we currently hold four custodial licenses globally, and we anticipate obtaining more in 2024. Through the Go Network and strategic partnerships, we will allow more of our clients and new participants to settle transactions across multiple regions with a network of exchanges. With regulated custody as the foundation, we aim to foster alignment among regulators and clients toward the common goal of safe access to digital asset markets.

42391921,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxZLT,1701695000,Jeremy Allaire's Stablecoin Is Building a Real Use Case for Crypto,"Jeremy Allaire, who founded Circle Internet Financial in 2013, is one of crypto's long-time heavyweights. 2023 may have been his best year in the industry yet. Circle is driving the adoption of stablecoins like USDC into mainstream finance and furthering financial inclusion around the world, all while navigating the complex world of crypto regulation.  ""We've launched more product and technology over the past year than at any other time in our history,"" Allaire told CoinDesk recently, emphasizing major launches of Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (which enhances USDC's interoperability and liquidity across blockchains), and a Web3 Services developer platform. These initiatives align with Circle's mission to make USDC, the second most popular stablecoin by trading volume, universally available and safe on multiple platforms globally.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  For the coming year, Circle's ambitions are threefold. First, Allaire wants to improve USDC's usability and safety to make it a seamless part of the financial system for hundreds of millions of users.  Second, he wants to expand global liquidity and distribution through banking and app partnerships.  Third, he wants to simplify Web3 app development and operation. ""We're looking to bring the adoption of stablecoins out of the early adopter phase and decisively into the mainstream scale phase,"" Allaire explained.  Competing in the stablecoin market  Stablecoins are arguably crypto's most successful innovation, with millions of daily users around the world. Tether, which operates offshore, is still the undisputed king: its market cap ($89 billion according to CoinMarketCap) still dwarfs USDC's ($25 billion), but USDC is making strides to close the gap. Allaire believes that Circle, which is based in the U.S., is well positioned for a time when stablecoins are regulated within new stablecoin legislation in the U.S, (which many observers think could be forthcoming in 2024, if any crypto legislation passes through Congress in an election year). Alliare believes USDC relative transparency, liquidity, and compliance will be advantageous as the market shifts, as expected, towards regulated stablecoins and mainstream adoption.  Allaire sees a future where billions join the internet financial system, requiring infrastructure that is safe, trusted, and integrated with the traditional financial system. ""The scale of adoption of USDC in the broader digital economy will be orders of magnitudes larger than it is now,"" he said.  Allaire highlighted USDC's role in financial inclusion and humanitarian aid. Organizations like the Singapore Red Cross and the UNHCR use USDC for safe, mobile-based financial transactions, even in conflict zones. In Latin America, USDC serves as a hedge against currency fluctuations and provides mobile-first financial infrastructure, significantly reducing cross-border transfer fees and promoting financial inclusion.  Allaire envisions Circle as a leading internet-scale utility and network, supporting trillions in economic activity. ""We hope to become one of the most important internet-scale utilities and networks in the world.""  Tokenized deposits and CBDCs: Navigating the future  Though an official central bank digital currency in the U.S. might compete with stablecoins like USDC and Tether (which are both dollar-pegged), Allaire supports development of a digital dollar. That is, if it embodies transparency, accessibility, and innovation, in contrast with China's more authoritarian approach.  ""That's the kind of dollar we want to win in this space race,"" Allaire stated. He envisions private stablecoins like USDC coexisting with CBDCs, contributing to a dynamic and evolving digital finance ecosystem.  Allaire sees USDC as a catalyst for economic growth and financial inclusion, especially in underserved regions. ""Over 75% of all USDC in circulation is held in digital wallets and smart contracts,"" he noted, indicating its potential role as a ""store of value"" akin to a bank account.  While much of the crypto industry struggles for use cases and acceptance, Allaire is showing how digital currencies, in the shape of stablecoins, can make a real difference to people's lives.",POSITIVE,USDC,ASIA | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | USDC,Lorna Blount ,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/jeremy-allaires-stablecoin-is-building-a-real-use-case-for-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/33f6e0b1d24720103bbd0cdd854192aa59967a83-350x350.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42391925,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxZfz,1701694976,Sergey Nazarov: The Crypto Oracle,"If digital assets are the future of finance and merging legacy financial systems with crypto is the key to this new system, Sergey Nazarov – the co-founder of the decentralized oracle network Chainlink – is one of the driving forces behind this revolution.  Chainlink [LINK] is bringing traditional finance (TradFi) firms and banks into the blockchain space, including heavy hitters such as SWIFT, DTCC, ANZ and more. The Chainlink network has enabled over $9 trillion in transaction value since 2022.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here. Nazarov is a speaker at CoinDesk's Consensus 2024 festival, May 29-31, in Austin, Texas.  The company, Chainlink Labs, founded in 2017, and distinct from the Chainlink protocol, has come a long way from building ""just an oracle"" system. It is also a pioneer in Web3 services for data, compute, cross-chain interoperability and connecting capital markets to the world of digital assets.  The token securing the network and used for payment of node operators that process requests – LINK – has been one of the top performers this year, rising more than 150% with a market capitalization of $8 billion.  Chainlink is accomplishing this by adhering to its three pillars: data, computation and cross-chain interoperability, Nazarov said in an emailed statement to CoinDesk.  Nazarov is particularly proud of Chainlink's newest offering – the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) – that banks and financial institutions are exploring to use to transact across public and private blockchains. CCIP is designed to facilitate the cross-chain applications and services, which could one day make up a global ""Internet of Contracts.""  As more TradFi institutions enter the digital world, Nazarov is seeing a growing demand for blockchain infrastructure.  In fact, the 35-year-old entrepreneur Nazarov, the son of Russian immigrants who were engineers and moved to New York in the early '90s, expects more big financial institutions to roll-out various blockchain projects in the next year and beyond.  Nazarov believes this will start a race among banks, asset managers and financial industry titans, ""which will eventually be connected back to public chains, growing the crypto industry.""  Merging the two industries won't be a small task, even though TradFi has come a long way from brushing off digital assets as just a bubble to understanding the technology's value proposition.  ""More and more people are waking up to the realization that our current system is built on paper promises, where critical real-world outcomes are predicated on whether individuals and institutions uphold their word,"" Nazarov said.  ""By enabling over $9 trillion in transaction value since 2022 across a wide range of verticals, including banking, DeFi, global trade, gaming, insurance and other major sectors, the Chainlink platform is integral to realizing the verifiable web and helping to bring the largest financial institutions in the world on-chain,"" he said.  For the next year and beyond, Nazarov is focused on turning CCIP into the global standard for cross-chain data and value transfer for both Web3 and traditional capital markets.  It's fitting that he can rock both a plaid shirt and a three-piece suit, a symbol of the two worlds coming together.  Q&A  What's your No. 1 goal for 2024?  Turning CCIP into the global standard for cross-chain data and value transfer for both Web3 and capital markets, so that in the following years we can combine Web3 and capital markets into a single global Internet of Contracts.  Give us a prediction for crypto next year:  Big financial institutions will launch various blockchain initiatives, bringing huge amounts of value onto blockchains. This will kick off a race for banks, asset managers, and financial industry infrastructures to create the best possible blockchains and smart contracts, which will eventually be connected back to public chains, growing the crypto industry.  Biggest achievement this past year  Chainlinkcollaborated with Swift (the global standard for financial messaging across 11,000+ banks) and more than a dozen large financial institutions on using CCIP for blockchain interoperability. Chainlink also collaborated with DTCC (the world's largest securities settlement system, processing $2+ quadrillion annually) on bringing capital markets on-chain with CCIP. Collaboration with ANZ Bank (one the world's largest banks with $1+ trillion in total AUM) on cross-chain tokenized asset settlement with CCIP, which was explored at Sibos. Also at Sibos, Sergey Nazarov presented a keynote on connecting all on-chain markets via Chainlink CCIP.  CCIP launched on mainnet, bringing the most secure cross-chain protocol to market to unlock the multi-chain ecosystem and onboard existing financial institutions to onchain finance. Data Streams also launched on mainnet to provide a high-performance, low-latency oracle solution for enabling ultra-fast and easy-to-use DeFi derivatives.  Chainlink has also solidified its position as a Web3 services platform for cross-chain services and all of the world's data and computation. The launch of Functions Beta, Automation 2.0, and CCIP significantly expanded Chainlink's platform, giving developers the ability to use Chainlink to power all their cross-chain and offchain needs and eliminating the need to introduce additional security assumptions when using multiple oracle services.

21042656,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563757,1701694848,"Bitcoin Triumphs Over $41,000, But Here’s What Could Prevent $50,000","Bitcoin has broken past the $41,000 level during the past day, but FOMO could be the number one danger to a further surge towards $50,000. Bitcoin Social Dominance Has Spiked Following The Rally According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, signs of euphoria have appeared among Bitcoin traders following the latest climb in the asset’s price. The main indicator of interest here is the “social dominance,’ which is based on another metric called the “social volume.” This latter indicator basically tells us about the amount of discussion related to a given topic that is happening on the major social media platforms right now. The metric tracks this by going through each post/thread on these platforms to see if they are making mentions of the topic or not. However, rather than counting the number of mentions themselves, it separates the posts and counts the total number of them instead. Related Reading: The Big Move: Crypto Pundit Predicts When Bitcoin Will Reach A New ATH Because of this approach, a more organic overview of the market becomes apparent, as the indicator will only spike when discussions are happening across social media, rather than inside just one or two large threads. The social dominance compares this social volume of any given coin against that of the top 100 cryptocurrencies combined. Thus, whenever this indicator shoots up, it means that the mindshare related to the asset is going up among social media users. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in both the Bitcoin social volume and social dominance over the past year: The value of the metric seems to have registered a large spike during the past day | Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin social dominance observed a huge increase when the Bitcoin price broke above $40,000 during the past day. This implies that users shifted focus toward BTC from the other coins after this rally. While some attention is healthy (it’s even required, otherwise the move would become unsustainable), too much hype has often not turned out to be favorable for the cryptocurrency in the past. An example of this is clearly visible in the chart, where the BTC rally hit its brakes back in March of this year after the social volume and social dominance both registered significant spikes. Going by this, the current even higher values of social dominance could be a worrying sign for the asset’s hopes of rallying toward the $50,000 mark. Though, so far, BTC has still been able to continue its climb despite this development, as it has now broken past the $41,000 barrier as well. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Blasts Past $41,500: Here Are The Reasons In the end, it comes down to whether the discussions have a bullish or a bearish view. More of the latter would provide better chances for the rally to continue. As Santiment explains, “FUD & FOMO toward the ongoing ETF confirmation dates will dictate whether $50,000 arrives sooner rather than later.” BTC Price It would appear that Bitcoin isn’t done with its surge yet as the coin has now risen above $41,800, inching closer to $42,000.

42391929,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxa0V,1701694842,Lisa Neigut: Reinventing Lightning to Reinvent Bitcoin,"Lisa Neigut is a bitcoiner's bitcoiner. First of all, she's from the maverick state of Texas. She uses the Lightning Network, which she helped build. She's teaching people the world over how to sync a node, and raising funds in sats to do it. And she's writing a textbook about bitcoin transactions.  The first time I spoke to Neigut, she said ""If you really want to get my attention, you can message me for a small fee on VIDA,"" a screener for spam that only lets paid messages through. In this industry, you call that proof-of-work.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  But given her bona fides, Neigut is also something of a late convert to bitcoin – at least compared to the OGs who remember conversing with Satoshi on BitcoinTalk in 2010. She said she bought her first couple thousand satoshis in 2018 using CashApp (as any bitcoiner would).  That same year Neigut started working at Blockstream as a developer. Before that she was predominantly an Android app developer, with her first dev job working on a mobile app for Etsy – particularly ""the in-app cart.""  ""I've been working in different aspects of 'ecommerce' almost my entire dev career,"" Neigut said in an email interview.  To some extent that remains the case. At Blockstream, Neigut is helping to develop Lightning, a scalable payments layer for Bitcoin that makes the cryptocurrency fast and cheap enough to use BTC for buying things like your morning cup of coffee.  Lightning has its issues, and Neigut is focused on fixing them. Although not yet an industry-standard term, Neigut has been working on what she calls ""Lightning v2,"" or version two, since 2019 to make it easier to move money around on the payments-focused protocol.  Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, is sometimes derided for being slow to adopt new innovations, a point Neigut contends. At Consensus 2023, for instance, she said the largest blockchain (by market capitalization) is poised for a ""Cambrian explosion"" of layer 2s that will accelerate adoption and development of the chain, including the one she's working on.  And, as of writing in late November, it's ""days away from being merged into the spec."" Kudos, Neigut. Though she isn't one to hog the spotlight:  ""The best part of working at Blockstream for almost half a decade has been getting to work with Rusty Russell and Christian Decker, two rightfully legendary bitcoin devs. When I got hired onto the Lightning team, Rusty joked that I was the diversity hire because I program in vim (he and Christian Decker are emacs users),"" she said, referring to different text editing systems.  Despite 2023 looking like the year Neigut will finish what it took four years to develop, she said she actually spent most of her time writing (and procrastinating from writing) the above-mentioned textbook.  Neigut is a graduate of the University of Texas at Austin, where she also worked as a teaching assistant in the McCombs Business School. The year she discovered Bitcoin, 2018, she worked for several months as a coder at Square.  Since 2021, she has been running Base58, a Bitcoin education company that hosts in-person and online workshops. This year, Base58 added two new classes on Taproot (a Bitcoin code update) and Lightning, and hosted several conferences called bitcoin++, including its first in Europe.  Q&A  What was your biggest achievement this past year?  Getting interop[ability] with Eclair [a bitcoin wallet] for the first phase of what I'm calling ""Lightning v2."" We're extremely close to having it merged [into the codebase], which would be my biggest contribution to the official Lightning specifications.  It's something I started working on in 2019, so it's really rewarding to have reached this point with the protocol!  (There's three phases to Lightning v2: v2 opens also known as ""dual-funding,"" splicing, and ""splice to close."" As of right now, the first two phases (v2 opens and splicing) are implemented in Core Lightning and Eclair; v2 opens are days away from being merged into the spec. These are really cool and important updates to Lightning because they allow for cheaper and more dynamic movement of on-chain bitcoin between existing and new Lightning channels.)  Other achievements include: ran my fourth ever bitcoin++ conference in 16 months, first ever in Europe; and launched two new classes for Base58 (Taproot + Lightning).  What's your No. 1 goal for 2024?  Level up 5,000 more devs into bitcoin protocols with Base58 courses (online or in person).  Please give us a prediction for crypto next year.

42391926,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxZl7,1701694622,Karl Floersch's 'Optimism' Tech Paved the Way for Coinbase's 'Base' Blockchain,"One of the major crypto stories of 2023 was the rollout of the Coinbase exchange's layer 2 network, ""Base,"" which made use of Optimism's blockchain technology.  The face of OP Labs, the main development firm for the popular Optimism protocol, is CEO Karl Floersch. He started in this role in May 2023, but he's been part of the company since May 2020, when he joined as CTO to focus on building what was then an experimental solution to scale Ethereum.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  During his time at OP Labs, he oversaw the release of the OP Stack, a set of tools that enable developers to build their own layer 2 chains using Optimism's technology. The stack went live during Optimism's Bedrock upgrade, which was a major overhaul to the network.  ""I think that it actually represents a new and really exciting step forward in how we think about open source software development, to be honest,"" Floersch said of the OP Stack in an interview with CoinDesk.  Floersch is an old hand in the Ethereum scene. Before OP Labs, Floersch worked at development studio ConsenSys as a blockchain engineer, followed by a stint in research at the Ethereum Foundation, according to his LinkedIn profile.  Optimism's open-source stack has made its way around the Ethereum ecosystem. In 2023, it scored a major client, the largest U.S. crypto exchange, Coinbase. The team at Coinbase, led by Jesse Pollak (also on the Most Influential list), worked closely with Floersch and the folks at OP Labs to build their own layer 2, known as Base.  One of the reasons why the OP Stack was chosen, according to Pollak, is its ""modular"" framework. Over the past year, zero-knowledge rollups have been surging in popularity. They make use of complex cryptography to ""prove"" that a certain transaction exists almost instantaneously using only a snippet of information. By contrast, optimistic rollups, which the OP stack is based on, take far longer for transactions to finalize. Because the OP Stack is modular, it can eventually make use of proofs from both optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups, Pollak argues.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | OP,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/karl-floerschs-optimism-tech-paved-the-way-for-coinbases-base-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/42cf49253589a7cfc1a99b15f6ca0ffd75ceb1bb-350x350.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42391916,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxZBD,1701694593,Avery Ching: Aptos Led a Year of 'VC Chains',"To be honest, there are many people who could be nominated alongside Avery Ching for this year's most influential list. The blockchain, Aptos [APT], that he helped develop as chief technology officer of Matonee, is one of a number of next-generation chains we could have nominated. Each has significant financial backing, recently launched public platforms and/or started to gain traction in 2023.  It's hard to say which, if any of them, has the best shot at shaking crypto to its core.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  There's Base, Blast and Celestia, which actually uses Cosmos [ATOM] software. All of them are Ethereum [ETH] scaling solutions; modular chains like Fuel Network and ThorChain [RUNE]; and others like Sei [SEI], Shardeum and Sui [SUI].  That last one, in particular, has practically an equal chance as Aptos. Both projects have the same origin: the blockchain subsidiary Meta (formerly Facebook) founded in 2019 to develop its stablecoin Diem (formerly Libra). They also have the same end-goal: scaling a crypto network to hundreds of thousands of transactions.  Neither is quite there yet.  Aptos and Sui, being constructed by Mysten Labs, also use the same custom programming language (Move, developed for the quashed Facebook stablecoin project), are being developed primarily by ex-Meta employees and even raised hundreds of millions of dollars from many of the same venture capitalist investors (a16z, FTX Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Binance Labs, among others). Meta, reportedly, has given its blessing to both, but hasn't disclosed whether it invested in either.  Both chains also represent legitimate technological advancements in blockchain design, and both founding teams are inking deals with impressive institutional players. Sui, for instance, is carving out a niche in gaming.  Moreover, both face similar criticisms over their potentially worrisome, long-term tokenomics (prescheduled ""unlocks"" will flood the market with SUI and APT) and were beaten up for the same reasons at launch (Aptos, in late 2022, and Sui, in early 2023, initially processed a fraction's fraction of the promised transactions).  Despite a severe curtailment of the number of VC dollars entering the blockchain industry since the collapse of FTX, this year could be said to be The Year of the VC Chain. And, in many respects, Aptos is the embodiment of this trend.  The story so far:  After leaving Meta in December 2021, Aptos's co-founders Mo Shaikh and Ching (who spent over a decade at the firm) decided to take the technology and go for it. It was all open source, after all. The two, who are six years apart in age, had met while working on Facebook's 300+ person blockchain team. They bonded over a mutual love of basketball and met for the first time in person the year they left Meta. Deciding to start a company was seemingly a matter of stubbornness.  ""I've never not launched a product, no matter what thing I've been a part of,"" Ching told Fortune in 2022. Both describe themselves as competitive and ambitious – in interviews Shaikh and Ching both often name data-heavy platforms like Netflix and Instagram as potential clients, one day – and each bring complementary skill sets. Ching had focused on coding the Diem blockchain while Shaikh led strategic partnerships at the Novi wallet division.  Aptos takes its name from an Ohlone word meaning ""the people,"" which is also the name of a nearby town in Palo Alto, CA, where the team is based. The name is meant to symbolize the ethos of Web3. ""If we collaborate with these larger institutions, we can meet the next billion users where they are,"" Shaikh told Fortune.  Multicoin Capital, the venture fund known for being early to Solana [SOL], could be said to be the duo's first backer, seemingly before Matonee was incorporated. It then raised $200 million in March 2022 (in a round led by FTX Ventures and Jump Crypto), $150 million that July (led by a16z) and an additional $50 million from Binance Labs in exchange for token warrants.  But there are people who would contest this version of events, and who want a slice of the firm's $2 billion valuation.  Sued by Glazer  In early March, Matonee and CEO Shaikh were sued by Shari Glazer (of the multiple sports team-owning Glazer family) and Swoon Capital, over a breach of contract. Glazer claimed she, instead of Ching, is a ""50/50"" partner with Shaikh in Aptos and should be considered a co-founder, as she initially pledged $10 million to back the venture.  Aptos filed to dismiss the case, arguing Glazer and Shaikh's deal was non-binding. In particular, Glazer said not to raise additional capital, which would dilute her shares, while Shaikh remembered saying her seed funding ""won't be enough."" Although a judge initially declined to dismiss the lawsuit, Glazer ultimately said she reached an agreement with the company — the terms of the settlement were not disclosed.  ""[Aptos] is pleased this case has been dismissed ... [and wishes] Ms. Glazer well in her future endeavors,"" a spokesperson told The Block in December 2022.  Though resolved, Glazer's concern over Aptos' funding does raise the question: what exactly will a blockchain do with nearly half a billion dollars? It costs money to hire skilled developers, especially those accustomed to Meta salaries. And, in an effort to build a community and ecosystem around the blockchain, Aptos has been hosting hackathons and is investing in a number of projects, including Kana Labs, Mintdropz and Indian social media app Chingari, Crunchbase indicates.  It's not really CoinDesk's place to judge, but these multi-multi-million funding rounds for new blockchains are not a free lunch. While 51.02% of APT tokens are planned to be distributed to the Aptos community, they will be released in monthly token unlocks for the next 10 years, according to Aptos' distribution schedule, which could put sell pressure on the token.  Many notable crypto commentators like Cobie also criticized Aptos for a lack of transparency when the token was first listed on exchanges like FTX, Upbit and Binance. Cobie has said this represents a significant fall from grace from the fair distribution of Bitcoin's proof-of-work system, which creates a competitive (but fair) market for coins, and even from the age of ICOs, which were available for public sale.  Mega-valuations for infrastructure is a growing trend and one that may be setting off alarms in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It took several years for the SEC to work out settlements with the largest ICO raisers, EOS and Telegram, which each raised over $1 billion. (Both Mysten and Matonee are U.S.-based.)  A recent court decision in SEC v. Ripple has set precedence for sales to VCs to be treated as ""investment contracts"" while sales to exchanges for retail trading are kosher.  See also: Brad Garlinghouse Is 2023's Comeback King With XRP's Win Over SEC | Most Influential 2023  Indeed, what little investing VCs have done in recent years amid a heavy cloud of market contagion, public criticism and reduced use across crypto has been almost entirely in base layers and building blocks.

That's why Jesse Pollak, the creator of Coinbase's ""Base"" layer 2, was chosen this year for CoinDesk's Most Influential list. He and the Base team brought the major exchange on-chain, showing how Coinbase can be a blockchain builder, growing sources of new revenue while extending its operations beyond being just a marketplace for crypto.  ""You're going to see every major player over the next five years realize, 'Oh, wow, in order to get the benefits of participating in this open on-chain economy, we need to bring more of our technology, we need to bring more of our customers, we need to bring more of our asset base on-chain into these open systems,'"" Pollak told CoinDesk in an interview.  Originally hailing from Washington, D.C., Pollak joined Coinbase in 2017 where he led their consumer businesses on the engineering side. But it wasn't until the fall of 2021 that Coinbase started to think of ways to bring its business on-chain.  That led Pollak and his team to look into the options for about a year. By the end of 2022, the group was convinced that Ethereum was the best place to focus its energy, and that a layer 2 was the best place to enter this market.  ""I think that we kind of believe that there's going to be many layer twos that collectively scale Ethereum rather than just kind of one single monolithic one,"" Pollak said in an interview. ""We saw this opportunity to really build our contribution to scaling crypto and scaling Ethereum. And that's what ultimately ended up being Base.""  Base, which went live in August 2022, is built using the OP Stack. Base has gained some recognition in the industry thanks to some of the social apps that have been deployed, like friend.tech, which during a few weeks in August was the second-largest revenue maker.  Meet Rebecca Rose, the artist who created the NFT image of Jesse Pollak for Most Influential 2023.  But the team at Base still views their layer 2 as a developer platform, with its vision to attract ""a million developers, a billion users."" That is about four or five orders of magnitude away from where the platform is today, according to Pollak.  The introduction of Base started a new trend: other exchanges are following suit. According to people familiar with the matter, Kraken, the second-largest U.S. crypto exchange and a competitor to Coinbase, is planning to come out with its own layer 2. OKX, another crypto exchange, recently announced their X1 layer 2 chain built on Polygon technology.  Pollak thinks that layer 2s will be brought to market by many more players in the industry. ""It's not just going to be crypto exchanges that do this. It's literally going to be everyone,"" Pollak said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/jesse-pollak-is-putting-the-base-in-coinbase,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e61a1b0f4d3847946414913becf41991079bb334-1080x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42391922,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxZVj,1701694491,Cuy Sheffield: The Reason Visa Is 'Everywhere’ in Crypto,"As head of crypto at Visa, a global payment company founded in 1958, Cuy Sheffield has had a busy, busy year.  Despite the down markets, dour mood and heavy workload for much of the time, he appears to be having fun experimenting, building and competing in this chaotic industry that may just represent a new financial paradigm.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here. Sheffield is a speaker at Consensus 2024, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.  In the third quarter, acting quickly on the heels of PayPal's stablecoin launch on Ethereum, Visa announced it would expand its own dollar-proxy pilot using Solana. Since 2021, Visa and Circle, the issuer of the second-largest stablecoin, USDC, had been trialing blockchains to improve cross-border payments.  Two years later, Sheffield had the pleasure of announcing that study was going well, and that Visa would expand onto Solana's high-speed network to improve its stablecoin treasury management.  This was far from the only successful crypto pilot Visa ran this year, and far from the only ""first"" Sheffield's team notched in the world of crypto payments. Indeed, perhaps more than at any other mainstream financial services company, Visa's crypto unit — under his leadership — has been running experiment after experiment.  There are some wins and some losses, like Visa's tie-up with defunct crypto exchange FTX, but Sheffield is still in the game. At the beginning of the year, he reaffirmed the company's proactive position on blockchain, saying the technology represents a possible game-changer for the payments industry — and that Visa was in it to compete and collaborate.  ""The recent failures do not change our crypto strategy and focus to serve as a bridge, helping connect both platforms and technologies emerging in the crypto ecosystem,"" he said, responding to an overzealous Reuters report that said Visa was ""slamming the breaks"" on its many crypto projects. ""That is where we have been investing and plan to continue to invest.""  The company takes a blockchain-agnostic approach — looking for ways to iterate, improve and build on many different distributed payment networks. In August, for instance, Sheffield announced Visa successfully tested a way to pay Ethereum gas fees using a credit card. And at the beginning of the year, it announced a partnership with bitcoin [BTC] rewards app Fold was going global.  Just as Visa works with a variety of different blockchain protocols, it is also taking a wide view on the types of organizations it is willing to work with.  It's perhaps unsurprising Visa would pilot stablecoin payments with merchant infrastructure providers like Worldpay and Nuvei, given payments tools are the payment giant's bread and butter, but the company is also working with DAOs like Gnosis, filing trademark applications for metaverse tools and getting involved with NFTs.  ""We think there are going to be millions of new merchants that emerge that are individuals, that are creators, that can reach this global audience. It's just, it's powerful,"" Sheffield said in an interview. ""That's the world that is coming here.""  The company is also involved with dozens of central bank digital currency (CBDC) projects across the map, in collaboration with Ethereum builders ConsenSys. (And as a civilian, Sheffield advises the Digital Dollar Project, founded by former CFTC Commissioners Daniel Gorfine and Chris Giancarlo.)  Sheffield, a graduate of Pomona College in California, joined Visa in 2015 after it acquired the company he was working for, TrialPay. He transitioned from partnerships to the head of Visa's burgeoning crypto unit in 2019, and has led that team ever since.  In direct competition with Mastercard, which has taken a comparatively cautious approach to crypto, Visa has worked to become the market leader in crypto payments and credit card options. It has launched card programs with a number of exchanges — some successful and others not. Perhaps that same could be said about some of the firm's NFT purchases.  Sheffield, who chairs a crypto hub at the World Economic Forum's Global Future Council, is also an avid NFT collector in his personal life.  ""The competitive advantage crypto has that most people haven't understood yet is that we just have more fun,"" he said previously in an interview.  What is your biggest achievement this past year?  At Visa we believe stablecoins can play a role in payments and help solve real-world problems. One of the biggest achievements for Visa this past year was expanding our stablecoin settlement capabilities and becoming one of the first major payment companies to leverage the Solana blockchain for live payment flows between clients. This was a significant milestone for us, as it demonstrated our ability to integrate with different blockchain platforms and enable faster, cheaper, and more scalable transactions for our partners and customers.  What's your No. 1 goal for 2024?  For 2024, the Visa Crypto team is focused on growing Visa's payment volume and role as a leading on and off ramp for consumers to move between fiat and digital currencies. We believe that crypto is not only a new asset class, but also a new payment network that can complement and enhance our existing offerings. We want to provide our users with more choice, convenience, and security when they interact with crypto, whether it's buying, selling, spending, or earning.  Please give us a prediction for crypto next year.  One of the predictions that I have for crypto next year is that we will see increasing interest from commercial banks across the world in tokenizing their deposits to enable new B2B and capital markets payment flows. By using blockchain technology, banks can create digital representations of their fiat currencies that can be transferred and settled in real time, without intermediaries or friction.

The law, approved by the European Parliament in April, makes it possible for crypto firms to operate across the EU's 27 member states if they manage to get authorized in one.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  A key figure behind the making of the landmark law was Stefan Berger, the center-right German lawmaker who negotiated the framework for the European Parliament.  As rapporteur for the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation (meaning he reported on the issue for the parliamentary committee that worked on legislative proposals), Berger was responsible for proposing amendments and running discussions with the Council that gathers member nations' heads of state.  As he steered MiCA through the EU's complex legislative process, he staved off efforts by lawmaker groups to limit the use of energy-intensive proof-of-work protocol that was broadly viewed by the crypto industry as a ban on Bitcoin. After FTX came crashing down in November 2022, Berger blamed it on the arrogance of its founder Sam Bankman-Fried instead of blockchain technology.  While skeptics questioned the strength of MiCA against bad actors, he pushed for the quick finalization of the legislation so that Europe will ""have rules which rule this type of situation out from the word go.""  The law, which offers crypto companies harmonious (or ""passport-able"") rulemaking across a bloc of close to 450 million people, is seen as a template for jurisdictions around the world to follow. Many in the U.S. crypto community compare MiCA's comprehensive legislation (for example, on stablecoins and exchanges) to the U.S.'s lack of lawmaking on digital assets.  Digital euro next  Now that MiCA's future is set, Berger is tasked with shepherding through Parliament the EU's grand plans for a digital euro, which might be an even bigger challenge than MiCA. EU lawmakers largely agreed that the crypto sector needed rules but they aren't exactly jumping at the idea of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).  A digital euro would require a lot of technical work potentially involving blockchain and have major privacy implications few lawmakers are on board with. Others welcome it as a necessary alternative to private crypto payments.

42391928,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxZvN,1701694271,Jordi Baylina: Finding Solutions in Zero-Knowledge,"One of the buzziest blockchain trends this year has been zero-knowledge rollups, a type of cryptography that makes blockchain transactions cheaper and faster.  Many layer-2 teams have raced to come out with their own chains making use of this technology that is powered by zero-knowledge proofs, a mechanism that determines validity with only knowing a snippet of information.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  Polygon, an Ethereum scaling solution, is one of the pioneers in the field. This year, its technical lead, Jordi Baylina, led the rollout of its zkEVM, a zero-knowledge rollup compatible with Ethereum smart contracts. Polygon's zkEVM went live in March with Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin initiating the first transaction.  Baylina is an OG in the industry. He founded the white hat group that saved funds from the Ethereum DAO hack in 2016 and created the Hermez network, a zero-knowledge rollup, which was acquired by Polygon in 2021.  When Hermez was acquired, ""Polygon was betting very hard in scaling and was betting very hard in the in the ZK tech,"" Baylina said in an interview. After his entrance into Polygon, Baylina put his efforts into bringing the zkEVM to life.  Baylina is particularly proud of the launch of Polygon's zkEVM, but recognizes that the team has had several milestones in 2023 in its pursuit to become an all-encompassing zero-knowledge network. Baylina said Polygon's latest ""Polygon 2.0"" roadmap, which outlines its plan for scaling, as well as the launch of its customizable Chain Development Kit (CDK) were other big moments for the team this year.  As for 2024, Baylina believes that it will be even more significant for Polygon. ""2024 it's going to be the year of explosion, of this network of Polygon 2.0, the explosion of zk rollups,"" Baylina told CoinDesk.

42391927,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxZqF,1701694212,Larry Fink: Wall Street's Biggest Bitcoin Believer,"Larry Fink, the CEO of world's largest asset manager, BlackRock, is a late convert to bitcoin [BTC] but is now one of its most influential proselytizers. This year, BlackRock shocked the world by filing an application to launch an exchange-traded fund that holds bitcoin. It is not much of an exaggeration to say that BlackRock's unexpected filing reignited interest in a crypto trading vehicle that many assumed was a lost cause – even if its iShares Bitcoin Trust, if approved, would be just one of hundreds of ETFs it manages.  For years, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been hesitant to approve a spot bitcoin ETF, in part out of concerns about market maturity and manipulation. (There are ETFs in the U.S. that own bitcoin futures, but spot ETFs would give investors more direct exposure to bitcoin.) BlackRock, one of the leading firms on Wall Street, simply by showing interest, helped to legitimize the effort and shows there is likely demand for such a product. Several other traditional financial institutions including Fidelity, Franklin Templeton and VanEck, and a bevy of crypto-natives like Bitwise and Hashdex, followed suit in applying to list their own BTC ETFs.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  A bitcoin ETF is important because it would give a wider range of institutions the ability to gain exposure to BTC, by holding shares of BlackRock's iShares or WisdomTree's BTCW, for instance, rather than bitcoin directly. This means retail and institutional investors can invest in bitcoin via a 401(k) or index funds. Also, the structure of spot bitcoin ETFs, if there is consumer interest, could put increased buying pressure on BTC and potentially lead to higher prices.  Fink said in an October interview with Fox Business that BlackRock clients are showing heightened interest in crypto, and that BlackRock's offering would ""democratize"" access to the asset class. He has also discussed recent market momentum as a ""flight to quality"" among currencies, and said cryptos will ""outshine"" global currencies in the coming months.  Even more, Fink has said bitcoin, being an open, verifiable and stateless currency, could become an increasingly important financial instrument. This is notable in that Fink used to count himself in the ""Jamie Dimon camp"" – the JPMorgan CEO is a well-known crypto skeptic – and once said that the world didn't need ""a new international currency."" Some of his positions are consistent; Fink also said bitcoin could weaken the U.S. dollar's position as a reserve currency, but now sees value in that proposition.  Fink's conversion is notable in that it is happening at a time when many in legacy finance are taking another look at blockchain, particularly for ""tokenizing"" real-world assets like stocks and bonds. He is instead interested in cryptocurrencies themselves. In August 2022, BlackRock announced plans for crypto trading on its Aladdin investment platform. BlackRock has also filed to list an ETF for Ethereum's ether [ETH].  While BlackRock's motivations are understandable, not much is known about the internal mechanizations of why it would enter the market today. BlackRock's filing, which has tapped Coinbase as a third-party service provider, was notable in that it may have found an answer to the SEC's market surveillance requirements – which many other applicants have modeled. There is some speculation that Fink and SEC Chair Gary Gensler were in private communication about an ETF listing, and that Fink is acting on a reasonable expectation that an ETF may finally, and soon, be approved.  Whether BlackRock is first to market with its iShares bitcoin ETF, it's clear that Fink believes in the value of bitcoin.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/larry-fink-wall-streets-biggest-bitcoin-believer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ae440653ab47333f262d776751d41be2a930a466-350x350.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This year, Christensen, a native of Denmark and graduate of the University of Copenhagen, set out to shake Maker up from its foundations in his grandiose plan called ""Endgame."" While his plan was initially met with pushback along with accusations of tyranny in an ostensible decentralized organization, the strategy started to pay dividends this year – literally.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  His initiative to integrate old-school assets like U.S. government bonds into a blockchain-native protocol was a trendsetter and spearheaded the real-world asset (RWA) movement, now one of the hottest topics in crypto. It also fueled Maker's turnaround, allowing it to rake in profits at a time when a bitter crypto winter weighed heavily on lending protocols as many crypto traders turned their back on DeFi.  And this was only the beginning. The next step will be to revamp Maker's clunky organization with the introduction of SubDAOs and prove decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) can work. Perhaps this should be no surprise: In 2020, a year Christensen topped CoinDesk’s Most Influential list, he announced he would dissolve the Maker Foundation, the centralized organization he founded and led to develop the Maker protocol.  That was the second time Christensen ceded control of a business he started in order to follow his interests. Christensen previously ran an EU-based company that helped bring people to China to teach English, which he sold to invest in bitcoin [BTC]. The idea for dai came after the collapse of Mt. Gox in 2014, as the foundation for a potentially more stable and transparent financial system.  We reached out to Christensen to ask him how he sees 2023 and what’s in store for next year.

He has done everything from releasing a 1,000-piece NFT art collection to benefit the Yawanawa indigenous people of the Amazon rainforest (which uses weather data from the village to power the works and has recorded over 8,600 ETH in secondary sales volume, all artist proceeds going to the tribe) to debuting his work on The Sphere, in Las Vegas, alongside visuals from U2 and Darren Aronofsky. Notably, he recently wrapped a significant run at the Museum of Modern Art where his generative artwork, Unsupervised, captivated thousands and was then acquired by the museum for their permanent collection.  It seems not everyone is a fan. Notable art critic Jerry Saltz referred to Anadol's MOMA work as ""pointless museum mediocrity"" and ""a massive techno lava lamp."" Anadol and Saltz got into a very public Twitter (X) spat over Thanksgiving, where Anadol pushed back on Saltz's opinions as Anadol and his online fans seemed not to grasp that art critics are called critics for a reason.  Despite this, Refik Anadol is arguably one of the most popular and influential digital artists working today and he is doing his best to raise the profile of data and AI-driven art. Additionally, his work on-chain continues to be highly sought after. He has released numerous NFT editions over the last two years and all maintain healthy floor prices should one want to collect, for example buying a Winds of Yawanawa edition will set you back about $17,000 at today's lowest offer on OpenSea.  As he continues to gain in popularity, we can only assume he'll enjoy more financial success from his thousands of social media shares. And, I can only assume it will be even harder to get him on the phone to discuss my next digital project.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | MARKET,Sam Ewen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/refik-anadols-ai-driven-work-breaks-big-in-2023,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ad13136d3b49df84a4e531476c791c8b69d8cb39-6595x6594.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42391935,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxaQ9,1701694083,Brad Garlinghouse Is 2023's Comeback King With XRP's Win Over SEC,"On a rainy Friday night in September, a crowd of thousands filed into Hammerstein Ballroom, the legendary New York concert venue.

Months earlier, the CEO of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, had promised that if they emerged victorious from the SEC's lawsuit, he would throw a ""proper party"" to honor and thank the XRP community.  (I had profiled the XRP community, aka ""XRP Army"" earlier this year. My TLDR takeaway: For years the XRP Army had been reviled by much of the crypto space, but in many ways they had a point and even deserve some overdue respect.)  Garlinghouse had made this promise back in May. He predicted he would be on the right side of the law and the right side of history. And sure enough, on July 13, 2023, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple had not violated securities laws when selling XRP to retail investors. The XRP Army rejoiced. The price of XRP (briefly) doubled. While lawyers continue to debate the exact implications of the ruling, it was widely seen as at least a partial vindication for Ripple, XRP, Garlinghouse, and perhaps the entire crypto space – more on that in a bit.  So Garlinghouse delivered The Proper Party. (The event's website literally called it ""The Proper Party."") And on the crowded dance floor in Hammerstein, many in the XRP Army – who had flown in from across the nation – wore XRP T-shirts, XRP baseball caps, and even XRP socks that said, ""XRP is not a security, 7.13.23.""  Then Garlinghouse took the stage. The crowd roared. He said some thank-yous and began to share a personal story. ""It's right before Christmas, and the goddamn SEC is suing me,"" Garlinghouse said into the mic, referring to the SEC's sudden announcement on December 22, 2020, that it had filed suits against Garlinghouse and Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen. The crowd booed at the mention of the SEC. Someone shouted, ""F#ck the SEC!""  ""I'm going to be honest, it was kind of a dark time,"" he told the crowd.  From SEC's Allegations to Ripple's Resurgence  Garlinghouse, who is 52 and originally from Topeka, Kansas, was surprised by the personal lawsuit. He felt betrayed. ""I had cooperated fully,"" he told me in a recent phone interview. ""Years before that, I had gone in and met with the Chair [former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton], and I didn't bring lawyers, because why would I? We were just sharing what we were doing. Like, 'Here's how we're using our technology.'"" He felt that Ripple was acting in good faith, but later came to believe that ""you don't always have a good-faith actor on the other side.""  Over the next two-and-a-half years, according to Garlinghouse, Ripple was forced to spend roughly $150 million to defend itself. This slowed growth in the XRP ecosystem. And the SEC's actions almost certainly suppressed the price of the XRP token – which was booted from Coinbase and other exchanges – ironically harming the very XRP holders that the SEC was nominally trying to ""protect."" (For my feature on the XRP Army, I spoke with one XRP ride-or-die investor, for example, who had gone from being a crypto millionaire to working at a Lowe's hardware shop, but he still had faith that the price of XRP would recover.)  Meet the artist who created the image of Brad Garlinghouse, La Vaun.  So why, ultimately, did the SEC sue Ripple and Garlinghouse? I asked him point-blank. ""Why do you think they sued you? What was the motivation?""  A pause.  A long pause.  The pause was so long, I worried the phone had cut out.  In this lengthy pause, I thought of the many allegations by the XRP Army, which claims that key figures in the SEC had links to the Ethereum Foundation, so they threw the book at Ripple as a form of regulatory capture. The theory is called ""ETHGate."" (I gave a primer here.) Would Garlinghouse go there?  At last, he acknowledged the lengthy pause and finally said, ""I don't know."" He added, ""I do believe that one day we will know,"" and that he ""found it pretty incredulous that they would bring this case against me and Chris individually.""  Since the December 2020 lawsuit – or ""The Grinch that Stole Christmas,"" as Garlinghouse has called the SEC – it was a bruising two years for Ripple and XRP. But they had quietly, almost stealthily, been building and innovating and creating partnerships. Ripple launched a central bank digital currency (CBDC) platform and announced relationships with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Taiwan's Fubon Bank, the National Bank of Georgia, the Dubai Financial Services Authority and more. To the outsiders it looked like XRP was a zombie project; the insiders sensed that XRP was poised, quite literally, to take over the world's central banking infrastructure.  There's still plenty of work to be done before world domination, but by any measure, Garlinghouse can point to 2023 as a triumph. This is why he's an easy choice for this year's CoinDesk's ""Most Influential"" list.  Oh, and the lawsuit against him personally? It was dropped in October. And the SEC's appeal of the July ruling? Rejected.  It's likely that the crypto industry as a whole – long suspect of Ripple – now benefits from its legal victory. If XRP is not a security (at least when sold to retail buyers), perhaps that's precedent for thousands of other projects that remain in a state of legal limbo.  Had Ripple not won this case, and had the allegations against me and Chris not been dismissed, that emboldens the SEC to be even more aggressive for more projects.  And perhaps the SEC will think twice about future lawsuits. ""Had Ripple not won this case, and had the allegations against me and Chris not been dismissed, that emboldens the SEC to be even more aggressive for more projects,"" said Garlinghouse. ""We drove a freight train through Gary Gensler's core arguments.""  Garlinghouse knows that his 2023 comeback didn't happen in a vacuum. He had help. He had a community. He even had an Army.  The XRP Army's role in shaping Ripple's battle  Back in the Hammerstein Ballroom, onstage, he had just told the crowd that December of 2020 was a dark time for him.  Then he added a crucial coda.  ""It was kind of a dark time … and out of nowhere comes a ray of sunshine,"" he told the crowd.  ""And that sunshine is named John Deaton.""  Again, the crowd roared. Garlinghouse pointed to a tall, bald, muscular, goateed lawyer, John Deaton, who in many ways embodies the heart and soul and brains of the XRP Army.  Deaton raised a fist in solidarity. Pumped the fist. The crowd cheered like he's a rock star, and to them he is. It was Deaton (with the help of XRP champions like Brad Kimes and ""Digital Asset Investor"") who rallied the XRP community to petition the judge that, actually, they were buying XRP (not Ripple) and had never even heard of Ripple, thus (they argue) weakening the SEC's argument. We'll never know to what extent this factored in Judge Torres' decision, but it's possible that the XRP community saved the day.  So you could make the case that this 2023 Most Influential award should be given not just to Garlinghouse, but also the entire XRP Army.  Garlinghouse seems to think so. ""To be able to say, unequivocally, that XRP is not a security is just epic,"" he told the Hammerstein crowd. Again they howled in delight. Some shouted ""Not a security!"" This is almost certainly the first time in the Hammerstein Ballroom's 116-year history that people joyously shouted, ""Not a security!""  ""Together we have fought these battles,"" Garlinghouse told the crowd, ""and together we won.""  Then Garlinghouse gave up the stage to Lenny Kravitz, who performed a show because Hammerstein is a proper concert venue, and this was a Proper Party.  UPDATE 12/5/23: This article has been corrected to show that Garlinghouse is the CEO of Ripple, not a cofounder as originally stated.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/ripple-xrp-brad-garlinghouse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea2f5bd1cb405ebc152296b48a83c15171905f3f-1080x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42391937,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxaVH,1701693984,Sam Altman: The World That Sam Made,"Let's get the obvious out of the way: The last two weeks of Sam Altman drama have made even the herky-jerky cycles of crypto look staid and boring. He's fired! He's back! He's fired! He's at Microsoft! He's back! In the span of 96 hours, it felt like he was in-then-out more times than bitcoin [BTC] has mooned and crashed.  At the time of this writing, Sam Altman is once again the CEO of OpenAI. The particulars are still unknown. Why did the board turn on him? What will an internal inquiry reveal? How will his new reign be different? There are many questions, and it could be a while before we know the answers.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  Click here to view and bid on the NFT created by Shavonne Wong. The auction will begin on Monday, Dec. 4, at 12 p.m. ET (17:00 UTC) and ends 24 hours after the first bid is placed. Holders of a Most Influential NFT will receive a Pro Pass ticket to Consensus 2024 in Austin, Texas. To learn more about Consensus, click here.  But in some ways none of that matters.  Or, more precisely, for the purposes of CoinDesk's Most Influential list for 2023, the recent whiplash is irrelevant.  Even if Altman never works another day in his life, you could make the case that he was not only 2023's most influential person in Web3/crypto, but more broadly the most influential person in the world, period, full stop. Thanks largely to ChatGPT, the genie of AI is out of the bottle and the world will never be the same.  The impact of AI on the Web3 space is sometimes obvious, sometimes subtle. The blindingly obvious: For much of 2023, it seemed like AI was all anyone in the tech world could talk about, dislodging crypto from its cultural perch. (A bear market didn't help.) Weekly AI meet-ups were the new bitcoin meet-ups. Countless blockchain projects ""pivoted to AI."" VCs poured billions of capital into AI startups.  Just look at the Google search trends for Bitcoin (blue) versus AI (red). The lines cross right after Altman released ChatGPT; that picture tells a thousand AI-generated words.  But look closer. While it's tempting to follow a ""crypto versus AI"" narrative, the truth is more complicated and reveals a surprising – and even healthier – relationship. At a recent crypto conference, I served as a judge for a hackathon, and nearly every project involved some form of AI. This doesn't mean they were ""AI projects."" They were Web3 projects with decentralized visions across a range of verticals and use cases, but most of them somehow harnessed AI to make them faster, more efficient and easier to scale. Isn't that one of crypto's fundamental goals?  Think of all the many tasks of a Web3 founder: Coding smart contracts, writing a business plan, launching a website, creating a logo, conducting market research, assessing the competition, hatching a marketing campaign, developing tokenomics, banging out blog posts, checking for errors, networking, and on and on and on. AI can help with all of this.  Meet the artist who created the image for this feature, Shavonne Wong.  As Haseeb Qureshi, Managing Partner of Dragonfly told me earlier this year, thanks to AI, ""productivity will increase dramatically. Smaller startups will be able to do more."" And while it's not quite fair to give Altman every bit of credit (or blame) for the impact of AI, he (via ChatGPT) is clearly the tip of the spear.  And, just as AI breathed life into the stock market, it has also fueled a new category of ""AI meets blockchain"" projects. True, many of these had launched before 2023, ranging from SingularityNET to Fetch.AI, but the eruption of generative AI gave a sudden urgency for new solutions. Could decentralized AI be a way to have our cake and eat it, too?  Worldcoin  Ironically, perhaps the most prominent AI-meets-crypto project comes from none other than Sam Altman himself. And that brings us to Worldcoin [WLD].  ""Introducing Worldcoin, a new cryptocurrency that will be distributed fairly to as many people as possible,"" Altman tweeted in October 2021, unveiling ""The Orb,"" a shiny chrome globe that scans your eyeballs. Once you have proved you are a human (as opposed to an AI-bot), you earn cryptocurrency just for having a pulse, as a type of universal basic income.  The ultimate vision is that super-advanced AI might replace jobs, but this will also create wealth and that largesse should be distributed to all, not just the wealthy tech elites. And the whole eyeball scanning thing? Altman and Worldcoin's parent company, Tools for Humanity, view it as a necessary evil. As AI gets better and better, they suspect the only way to prove we're human will be with biometric data.  Click here to view and bid on the NFT created by Shavonne Wong. The auction will begin on Monday, Dec. 4, at 12 p.m. ET (17:00 UTC) and ends 24 hours after the first bid is placed. Holders of a Most Influential NFT will receive a Pro Pass ticket to Consensus 2024 in Austin, Texas. To learn more about Consensus, click here.  Just before Worldcoin officially launched in July of this year, I traveled to Berlin and used The Orb to scan my eyeballs. I met with Tools for Humanity CEO Alex Blania, I learned all about how The Orb works, and I spoke (via Zoom) with Sam Altman. (I wrote about it here.) He told me that he expects there to still be jobs in a post-AI world – likely better jobs than we have now – but that ""we're going to need some sort of cushion through the transition.""  Altman views Worldcoin as that cushion. In 2019, it was just an idea. As Blania told me in Berlin, it was originally conceived as ""the Bitcoin Project,"" with the goal of giving free bitcoin to everyone on the planet. In 2020, they built prototypes. In 2021 and 2022, they began rolling it out. And, in July of 2023, Worldcoin officially launched. Three days after the launch, Altman posted a video and tweeted that there are ""crazy lines around the world,"" and that ""one person [is] getting verified every 8 seconds now.""  The torrid pace continued. Four months later, Worldcoin already has 2.5 million sign-ups. Whatever your thoughts on the merits of Worldcoin, it must be acknowledged this is a stunning achievement in terms of crypto adoption. For some quick context, there are roughly five million Dogecoin wallets – a beloved cryptocurrency with several viral pushes over a decade. Worldcoin is halfway there in four months.  Even if Altman had no role whatsoever in ChatGPT or OpenAI, the aggressive roll-out of Worldcoin alone could earn him a nod for CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023 list. Bonus? Altman, Blania and the team from Tools for Humanity have effectively created a form of self-sovereign identity, or SSID, long one of crypto's holy grails. It's possible that even if the ""coin"" part of Worldcoin flounders (and the WLD token is still not available in the US for regulatory reasons), the privacy-preserving ""World ID"" will unlock value and use cases across the globe.  Altman knows Worldcoin has its skeptics. But, as he told me earlier this year, he's confident that as people get and use Worldcoin and World ID, that will create a domino effect that will, eventually, address the larger concerns. ""What really works,"" Altman told me, ""is the first million people, the early adopters, the people leaning forward – convince the next 10 million. Then that next 10 million is closer to the normies. And they convince the next 100 million. And those are really the normies that convince the other few billion.""  And meanwhile, these few billion normies will almost certainly – in ways we can't yet predict – be impacted by AI … regardless of where Sam Altman works.",NEUTRAL,BTC | WLD,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | WLD,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/sam-altman-the-world-that-sam-made,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9858662ee81606765c006412c34fa0011ce64c0f-1080x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42391915,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxZ65,1701693961,Brian Armstrong of Coinbase Is Crypto's Last Big Man Standing,"Founders and CEOs come and go in crypto's upper echelons. But is Brian Armstrong forever?  It's a question worth asking after the 40-year-old head of Coinbase has been on the job for more than a decade. In that time, he's outlasted most of his business partners as well as the competition to create the most important exchange serving U.S. crypto traders.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  Navigating the competitive crypto landscape  Now, Coinbase is finding potentially lucrative ways to enter new product markets, including the derivatives trading game. In mere weeks, it might begin custodying BTC for one of the many bitcoin [BTC] exchange traded funds (ETFs) waiting for regulatory approval. After all, Coinbase is the partner of choice for most of the issuers.  As for Armstrong's biggest business foes, well, they've been vanquished by his home country.  Before FTX imploded under the weight of its CEO's massive fraud scheme, Sam Bankman-Fried was planning to rewrite the rules of U.S. futures trading – an arena Coinbase entered just last month. Of course, it didn't end up quite how he envisioned it. SBF started FTX in 2019 and resigned in 2022.  And Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao no longer poses a threat to Armstrong's top-dog stature. In November, Binance's king of crypto stepped down as part of a deal to atone for the wily exchange's past compliance sins. Binance remains the world's largest exchange, and therefore a competitor to Coinbase's global ambitions. But it will go forth without the input of the founder who put it there (Richard Teng, a relative unknown, is the new CEO). CZ started Binance in 2017 and stepped down this year as his company faced multiple investigations from U.S. authorities.  Armstrong, who started Coinbase in 2012, shows no signs of slowing down. Reached by email, he detailed several major accomplishments this year, starting with the launch of Base, Coinbase's popular Layer 2 (CoinDesk's ""Most Influential 2023"" also honors Jesse Pollak, Base's lead architect).  Coinbase also moved aggressively into crypto derivatives this year, with the launch of a new international exchange, and the facilitation of U.S. derivatives trading through its Coinbase Financial Markets service. ""Derivatives make up 75% of global crypto volumes and the industry is in need of a trusted, regulatory compliant exchange like Coinbase to offer safe derivatives products,"" Armstrong told CoinDesk.  Coinbase's political and regulatory strategy  To be sure, Coinbase faces major headwinds, particularly on the regulation front.  This June, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched a major lawsuit against Coinbase, accusing it of operating an illegal securities exchange, broker and clearing agency.  The case is a key one for the whole crypto industry, which, by inference, faces the same accusations of massive securities violations. Coinbase finds itself as a standard bearer for the whole industry in its fight against Gary Gensler's SEC, which seeks to treat all tokens, bar bitcoin, as securities and therefore subject to the SEC's remit.  Against Gensler's depiction of Coinbase as profiting off crypto's wild west is Armstrong's vision of the company as something closer to a local sheriff. After all, Coinbase is one of the world's most tightly regulated crypto exchange companies by virtue of its listing on public markets, which happened in 2021. That moment capped years of compliance concessions that Armstrong says slowed its growth but was well worth it.  ""It's more difficult and expensive to take a compliant approach. You can't launch every product that customers want when it's illegal. But it's the right approach because we believe in rule of law,"" he tweeted on Nov 21, after CZ pleaded guilty.  Now that crypto's ""new chapter"" has arrived, Armstrong is well poised to lead its public-facing front even more than he already has.  The bald-headed CEO has never been one to shy away from controversy. In late 2020, he declared Coinbase would be a ""mission-driven company"" that would not engage with its employees on social activism fronts, as many other Silicon Valley startups were doing at the time. Instead, he wanted employees to focus solely on Coinbase's commitment to crypto. This would be the single political area where Armstrong said Coinbase would engage.  Oh, did it ever.  In 2023, Coinbase and Armstrong pushed back in the perceived ""war against crypto"" with vocal calls to action against the U.S. agencies leading it. Whether it's compelling customers to flood troublesome IRS rules proposals with comments, or criticizing the SEC for regulating by enforcement, Armstrong is seeing his statement through.  The most important entrant to Armstrong's battle may be its non-profit, Stand With Crypto. Launched in mid-2023, the pro-crypto policy group's stated mission is to defend the entire industry from critics in America's halls of power.  The group is modeling its efforts around what's worked for the U.S.'s most influential advocacy outfits. Planned Parenthood and the National Rifle Association both grade politicians based on their commitment to niche political issues – a tactic that helps voters divvy up their donations as well as their votes. Stand With Crypto is doing the same.  ""There's 52 million Americans who use crypto now,"" Armstrong said in a CNBC interview in late September, right after he chaired a Stand With Crypto event in DC. By his actions – if not his words – he was doing what he could to be the voice for this ""major constituency.""  ""Coinbase was proud to help launch an independent movement known as Stand with Crypto that now has more than 100,000 advocates and unique tools that help connect advocates directly with their representatives to make their voices heard,"" Armstrong told CoinDesk via email.  Stand with crypto  It is worth remembering that Stand With Crypto serves Coinbase's business interests. This is a publicly traded company that seeks to grow by onboarding more people into its services, generating more revenue, boosting its share price for its investors. Regulatory clarity and Capitol Hill muscle could clear the field and get it done.  Regardless, it's not engaged (at least not yet) in the narrow kind of rulemaking lobbying that will predominantly serve ITS business interests, as FTX tried to do with commodities rulemaking. The fight that Coinbase and Armstrong are leading would likely pay dividends for the entire industry. It just so happens that Coinbase's number-one position means it stands to benefit the most.  Armstrong's efforts to crowdsource Coinbase's political influence points to the company's subtly shifting strategies. Undoubtedly it's one of the biggest crypto lobbyists in D.C., having spent $2.1 million through the first three quarters of the year.  ""Now that some enforcement actions have landed, we have an opportunity as an industry to turn the page and write the next chapter of crypto adoption. I'm proud that Coinbase has always taken a compliant and trusted approach, and built for the long term, playing by the rules,"" Armstrong writes. ""What keeps me motivated is that I'm passionate about economic freedom, and I can see that the technology underlying crypto is powerful enough that it will help bring this to the world. Crypto isn't going anyway, it's the future of money, and will become a greater share of global GDP over time,"" he said.  ""With Layer 2, ETFs, and the Bitcoin halving next year, I'm optimistic for 2024.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/coinbase-brian-armstrong-crypto-leadership,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bc869ced1c9aa17c6b210ab33ab0663cb636bd67-350x350.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The longtime regulator, former banker and one-time academic is tasked with one of the more difficult jobs in the U.S. crypto-regulatory sphere: He runs the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, an independent federal markets regulatory agency tasked with protecting American investors and enforcing guardrails over U.S. capital markets – of which the $1 trillion crypto sector is only a tiny fraction.  Gensler is a controversial figure within and outside crypto circles. Politicians who disagree with his views and actions have introduced bills to defund parts of his agency and cut his salary.  ""He could withdraw the SEC's lawsuit against Ripple Labs, approve the U.S.' first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and provide clarity for businesses hoping to launch and trade a crypto token compliant with federal law without having to endure the SEC's expensive and time-consuming registration process,"" I wrote in 2021, the first time Gensler was named to CoinDesk's ""Most Influential"" list.  In 2023, the SEC won a partial victory (or suffered a partial loss, depending on how you look at it) in its case against Ripple. A spot bitcoin ETF is still just a dream in the eyes of issuers and exchanges, though hope that one may be approved as soon as next month has never been higher. And while the SEC has been publishing guidance (or at least proposed rules) and sharing hints about how it would enforce securities laws in crypto, it hasn't quite matched industry hopes of a bespoke model that would allow the vast majority of tokens to trade on U.S. platforms (or deem these tokens not securities).  ""I think there's been progress, and I think the lawsuits have been helpful,"" said one employee of a crypto company with business before the regulator (hereafter ""first person."")  CoinDesk spoke to multiple individuals for this article; all have been granted anonymity due to their work before the agency. Two of them pointed out that crypto, as attention-grabbing as it is, likely isn't one of the bigger issues the SEC has to deal with. In 2023 alone, the SEC has published rules or proposed rules addressing the Privacy Act, cybersecurity, conflicts of interest, climate disclosures, swap execution facilities, beneficial ownership and more.  ""Crypto is only one small part of that larger [mandate],"" the first person said. ""How do you balance all of that when industry participants and journalists struggle with keeping up?""  Crypto enforcement  Rules aside, Gensler's vision for how crypto should be regulated seems pretty clear: If you're operating a crypto trading platform – an exchange, in industry parlance – and you've listed certain tokens (basically anything that isn't bitcoin), you need to separate out your brokerage function from your clearinghouse function from your exchange function. Crypto trading in the U.S. should be similar to other securities trading in the U.S.  Settlements with Beaxy and Bittrex, and lawsuits against Coinbase, Binance and Kraken have all angled toward that basic idea.  ""The role of the SEC as a disclosure-based regulator is to protect investors. He has definitely over-indexed on enforcement,"" the first person said. ""I think some of the criticism at him using these enforcement actions as publicity stunts is fair, but that dovetails with I think he has a tough job.""  One of the chief industry complaints about the SEC – under both Gensler and his predecessor Jay Clayton – is the use of enforcement actions in lieu of explicit rulemaking or guidance that companies can use as a bright lines test. This idea that crypto exchanges should partition out these different types of businesses in an industry where it's unclear if doing so is even technologically possible has only further stoked ire against the federal regulatory agency.  The tone coming from the top of the agency ""really matters,"" a second person, an attorney in crypto, told CoinDesk. ""Most of the griping about Gensler is that he has substantive points but the way he [talks to the industry seems gleeful].""  ""He's got a clear policy agenda and that's what he cares about the most and that's to his credit, he cares about it,"" this person said. ""He will be rougher than other heads to get what he wants.""  And it has been a rough year in crypto. Just over a month ago, a former titan of industry was convicted of fraud and conspiracy tied to the collapse of FTX. Before his exchange fell apart, Sam Bankman-Fried was active in Washington, D.C., meeting with Gensler and his Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) counterpart Rostin Behnam, as well as influential lawmakers in both the Senate and House of Representatives. Last month, the world's biggest exchange, Binance, pleaded guilty to violating various anti-money laundering and related laws in cases brought by multiple agencies (though not the SEC).  The industry has also seen billions of dollars stolen from decentralized finance and other crypto projects worldwide over the past 11 months. While SEC regulations perhaps wouldn't protect investors using DEXs outside the U.S., a number of regulators are raising alarm bells over the hacks happening and subsequent laundering of funds.  ""If the industry wants to move forward, there needs to be a mechanism by which to sort of exorcize [violations],"" said a third person, another attorney whose company has business before the SEC.  One of many  Gensler, as the head of the SEC, also bears the brunt of the public outcry against his agency, but that may not be a fair reaction, some of the people CoinDesk spoke to suggested.  ""I think he catches a lot of flack for things that were not in his doing. He didn't bring the Ripple case. I don't think he brought"" the special-purpose broker-dealer rule either, the third attorney told CoinDesk, referring to two of the controversial actions the SEC has engaged in over the past few years.  ""You have a man who gets a lot of attention but we forget a leader is not a leader without a great team,"" the first person said.  The second person took a different view: while Clayton – like Gensler – said repeatedly that ""a lot of"" crypto looks like investment contracts, but Clayton – unlike Gensler – ""also said the way to go forward is to do something that doesn't leave the ecosystem high and dry.""  That path forward, outside what's been shown through the SEC's enforcement actions, remains incredibly unclear.  ""As an industry, it's really important to strike the right balance between calling out professional disagreements that policymakers may not get and also as an industry I think we should. We have a responsibility to help people appreciate this asset class,"" the first person said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/gary-gensler-the-crypto-lightning-rod-who-runs-the-sec,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b3d3ca5142f38ea72548202a00484e6e06e67fd1-350x350.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42391930,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxaAl,1701693812,PayPal's Jose Fernandez da Ponte: Stablecoins for All,"When PayPal announced plans this August to issue its own dollar-backed stablecoin, it felt like a moment to define an era.  Stablecoins are already a bone fide success story in crypto, with a market cap of about $140 billion and thousands of daily users, and here was a company with the acumen, network and regulatory credibility to take the product to a new level.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here. Jose Fernandez da Ponte is a speaker at CoinDesk's Consensus festival in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.  There are sizable companies issuing stablecoins linked to the U.S. dollar today (notably Tether with USDT and Circle with USDC, which dominate the market). But PayPal is in a whole different category, given its size and legitimacy as a long-time fintech powerhouse. Launched in 1998, PayPal helped define e-commerce and was a big part of why companies like eBay became household names. It was fintech before fintech really became a thing in the 2010s.  PayPal's move into stablecoins this year came at an opportune time for an industry weathering the storm of sagging asset prices, regulatory scrutiny and the fallout from FTX and other crises. It was a strong endorsement from Silicon Valley for a technology that many have written off as unreliable, hard-to-use, even pointless.  PayPal has 450 million customers. It's available in 200 countries. And, as a company, it has deep experience in the payments field, with proven user-centric tech and legal compliance in all those jurisdictions. With its Ethereum-based stablecoin (PYUSD), PayPal has an opportunity to mainstream crypto technology for the masses – bringing faster, more useful internet-based payments to a large number of people around the world.  The man behind this announcement was Jose Fernandez da Ponte, a bespectacled, unassuming Spanish-American, who moved to the U.S. 12 years ago. In a recent interview with CoinDesk, Da Ponte explained how PayPal came to make its move and why, and how he sees stablecoins changing the world of payments.  Da Ponte looked at ease as he spoke, happy with life in California with his wife and three boys. Recently, he'd said he'd been watching the Rugby World Cup. I asked him if he read Noam Chomsky, a libertarian socialist philosopher,like Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire. He said he was more of a John Rawls fan, a philosopher of egalitarian liberalism. ""I would love to read more fiction and just can't find the time,"" he said.  Speed, cost, contracts  PayPal was drawn to stablecoins by the promise of superior cost, programmability and speed, Da Ponte said.  ""I'm a payment person more than I'm a crypto person,"" he said. ""When I look at how you can move value around 26 times cheaper than with banking rails, [I take notice]. You think 'OK, the markets and adoption and regulation can defy gravity for a while.' But, if you have a technology that allows you to do things 26 times cheaper, you know there is something here.""  Cost aside, stablecoins also settle in minutes compared to days-long lag times with bank transfers, Da Ponte said. Also, transactions can do more than transfer money; stablecoins can be programmed with smart contracts that settle business transactions (say, that a company has delivered goods as agreed) along with payments.  PayPal could be forgiven for moving more slowly. Following last year's crypto scandals, the industry isn't exactly flavor-of-the-month among policymakers and the public, and the possibility of regulatory interference is high. The U.S. currently lacks specific legislation covering stablecoins, meaning that regulators are arguably empowered to make their own judgments as to whether companies like PayPal are playing within the rules. In early November, PayPal revealed that it received a subpoena earlier this year from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requesting documentation about its USD stablecoin.  PayPal's long game with PYUSD  The question going forward is whether policymakers will go along with PayPal's idea. Arguably, PayPal is doing on a public-facing network (Ethereum) what Facebook wanted to do on a private one with the ill-fated Diem/Libra project. Both projects were stablecoin ventures. Will the U.S. allow a company like PayPal to control a stablecoin if it was generally aghast at Facebook issuing one?  Da Ponte is undeterred by this question. PayPal is playing a long game, he said. It expects the regulatory environment to be clearer in 2024 and for companies with strong compliance and fully attested reserves to win out over time. Stablecoin market leader Tether, which has a market cap of $90 billion, is based offshore and has long been criticized for a lack of transparency in its accounting and reserves management (USD stablecoins, which are designed to maintain their value, are backed by reserves held by their issuers).  ""We think that in the long game, you need to have a strong regulatory structure. You need to have transparency on reserves. You need to have strong on-ramps and off-ramps,"" Da Ponte said.  ""And you need very strong network effects. You see some stablecoins launch that never get to critical mass and you see some stablecoins where adoption is a bit of an S-curve. I think that there are a couple of stablecoins out there that have this curve, but, five years ago, there were no stablecoins at all. I don't think the landscape is defined at all.""  ""My hypothesis is that we will see 10X growth in the asset size of stablecoins in the next five years. We are in such early innings that I don't think that anyone has a position or a market share that is secured.""  Most of the innovation in fintech in the last 20 years has come in the form of better user interfaces and functionality, while the underlying bank-based infrastructure has remained largely unchanged, Da Ponte said. Stablecoins allow individuals and businesses to transmit value directly over the internet without the usual intermediaries. That's a game-changer in locations that lack solid infrastructure and where costs and settlement times are higher than in the U.S. or Europe.  ""I did a lot of work in payments in Latin America before I came to the U.S., so I'm very aware of the pains of things that we take for granted in Europe and the U.S.,"" Da Ponte said. ""I think you will see adoption first in a few places geographically, like Africa and Latin America and Southeast Asia that are already driving that adoption. But also I think that you will see a lot of cross-border flows between the U.S. and the European Union, and these markets.""  Da Ponte said PayPal chose Ethereum because it's already used by other USD stablecoins like USDC and USDT (Tether). It has a healthy community of developers behind it and regulators are used to monitoring flows on that network. But PayPal's blockchain chief sees potential in other blockchains, too.  ""I'm sure that we will go and deploy on other protocols in the future as well,"" he said. ""I think that there is going to be a combination of layer one and layer 2s [in the future]. For us, the most decisive factors are scale and throughput.""  Regardless, PayPal is committed to the ethos of public blockchain infrastructure over the closed networks that carry the world's financial transactions today.  ""One of the reasons that we wanted to go to open-source protocols is that we don't think that there should be a PayPal protocol,"" Da Ponte said.",POSITIVE,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | USDT,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/paypals-jose-fernandez-da-ponte-stablecoins-for-all,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea2a8d7c1ec6cd89d540440ce0d3fa4800cc1ea5-350x350.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42391924,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfxZar,1701693505,Paolo Ardoino: The Hardest Working Man in Crypto,"The “smart take” among the cryptocurrency industry’s educated or otherwise influential elite is that Tether, the maker behind the world’s largest stablecoin, tether, is “unfairly maligned,” but may eventually fail. Not only is USDT the most successful stablecoin, a type of blockchain-based asset designed to hold a stable value, but it could be said to be the most successful crypto product to date. USDT may not have the market cap of bitcoin [BTC] or ether [ETH], the two largest free-floating cryptos, but it crushes them in terms of volumes. And so, if it crashed, as some expect, it would fall hard.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  People use tether. It is used to trade, to hedge, to transfer, to pay, to bridge, to exchange, to value and to take account. In other words, tether is used like money. It is used the same way a U.S. dollar is used. In fact, that is the point — Tether creates tethers to bring dollars on-chain, and now, because dollars are on always-running and globally-accessible blockchains, dollars are available around the world, anytime and anywhere.  So what is the fuss? Ask a so-called Tether Truther, those who would say the company is fairly maligned (and destined to fail), and they might point out the other ways tether is or alleged to be used. Tethers are sometimes used to bribe, to violate sanctions and to launder money. Some say tethers are also used to prop up inflated valuations across the crypto markets. Often, Tether’s skeptics simply repeat the various things Tether itself has said over the years, since the company was founded in 2014, to show inconsistencies.  The claims Tether has made about how tethers will be backed have changed overtime — first by dollars and now by dollar equivalents — raising questions about why and how and what it means. Tether is, in many ways, a simple business to understand: It takes in money and hands out tokens. It operates not unlike a bank or money-market fund in traditional finance. And the biggest worry about the biggest stablecoin is equally simple: if it is really holding the money it is meant to be holding?  See also: Reviewing the Tether Documents  Paolo, promoted  All of these concerns and all of tethers’ vast influence is now the responsibility, primarily, of Paolo Ardoino, who was promoted this year to chief executive officer of Tether. Ardoino is a company man. He has been a public face of the firm for years, which is sometimes criticized for a lack of communication and clear stewardship. Ardoino was chief technology officer of Tether and its sister company, crypto exchange Bitfinex, before rising in rank (he remains CTO of Bitfinex). He’s been at both essentially since inception, starting out as a senior software developer.  There is a convincing argument to make that Ardoino is the hardest working man in crypto. Look at his GitHub; he has 3,275 code contributions this year (2-3 per day is considered average for a full-time engineer), and in 2017 he notched 37,720 commits. In addition to running Tether and coding Bitfinex, which for a time was the largest exchange, Ardoino also founded and serves as chief strategy officer of Holepunch, a peer-to-peer communications platform that he conceived with a friend five years ago.  “I don't have other passions apart from what I am doing,” he said in an interview. He mentioned the martial arts training that keeps him from being logged on all day. “I really don't have other hobbies.”  Some men work to live, and others live to work. Ardoino is deep in the latter camp. Since transitioning to CEO this year, he said he’s been trying to keep his hands and mind active by keeping up with the code. Ardoino leads something of a moonshot division inside Tether, which has about 25-30 engineers building and researching tools he thinks will one day make bank and better the world. The team already has work to show for it, a decentralized video calling application called Keet, which runs on Holepunch.  “Becoming the CEO of Tether has been a process. The transition has been discussed openly with the board and rest of management for several months. I've been considering myself more than a developer for quite some time,” Ardoino said in an emailed statement. “I love managing teams, planning the strategy for the company and products and executing granularly.”  The division does not have a formal name, but could be compared to the company research parks of yesterday, like the telecommunications subsidiary formerly known as Bell Labs (which has housed a number of notable engineers and helped build the modern internet) or Google’s X innovation unit. Only Ardoino envisions his unit not only as a for-profit, but as being profitable. The team has its eyes on Bitcoin node infrastructure and artificial intelligence, among other technologies with potential to commercialize.  ""It's a well-calculated approach that we have,"" he said, mentioning the firm is investing about 10% of its cash in R&D. The projected revenues on Tether's bitcoin mining ""will make money,"" though there is an almost ""philanthropic"" approach to some of Ardoino's other initiatives. ""We are trying to put ourselves in a position where, in the future, we won't be able to be evil because we are building technology that everyone can use,"" he said, referencing Google's now-infamous slogan, ""Don't Be Evil.""  Humble beginnings  Ardoino, who has piercing blue eyes reminiscent of Frank Sinatra, hails from a small rural town in northern Italy. Genoa, specifically, the land of “pesto and focaccia,” he said. He had an early affinity for computers. He remembers his first: an Olivetti 386, circa 1991, which had 4MB of RAM and a 3.5-inch floppy disk port. It ran MS-DOS. “I remember my father telling me the computer cost a couple of months’ salary,” he said. He was told to play with it carefully.  “I was so excited that I told all my friends at school. I remember my math teacher heard me and replied that computers were just a waste of money, time and would never be useful to people,” Ardoino said. He lived far away from his friends and preferred to spend his afternoons on the computer. He got bored of the available applications like Microsoft Word and Paint. He taught himself to code, so he could make his own games.  I don't have other passions apart from what I am doing  He was an early Linux user. He imbibed writings from Linus Torvalds, the founder of that open-source operating system, who posted the software free online and invited people to try to improve it. This was an idea that resonated with Ardoino, it was a game where everyone won. He also read Richard Stallman’s ""GNU Manifesto,"" which remains a foundational document for the free software movement, and Eric Raymond's ""The Cathedral and the Bazaar,"" which makes the case that code should be built bottom-up, in public and be free to enter (like a bazaar) rather than top-down and closed off (like a cathedral). Asimov is his favorite writer.  ""From the outside it can look messy and noisy — it's not poetic at all, but if you are inside, if you look, the bazaar is extremely efficient,"" he said. You can take away parts from a bazaar and it remains what it is, it is flexible and resilient, whereas a cathedral is a ""monolith."" Bitcoin, which came out a decade after Raymond's writing, is bazaar software.  Ardoino stayed close to home when going to college, the University of Genoa. He studied computer science and math as it applied to computer science. He was part of groups for students who wanted to work on Linux, and got more interested in distributed computing, parallel computing and peer-to-peer systems.  “BitTorrent is really dear to me,” he said. He remembers when the software came out, as he remembers the launch of many peer-to-peer applications. He can recall the specs of filing-sharing software from Gnutella to Napster, to BitTorrent, to Kazaa, to Limewire, the way some people recall the kings and queens of England.  Towards the end of his college career, he worked on a three-person research project about “resilient networking” that would allow “people to communicate even in the worst case scenarios.” He loved the work, hated the money. “Being Italian, you weren’t paid much,” he said, saying each researcher earned $800 per month. “So I started looking for other opportunities.”  He taught himself finance and economics, he said. In 2011, he took his first job with a hedge fund, designing and calibrating its trading systems. By 2013, he was in London, the regional finance hub, running his own startup that created trading software products for hedge funds. The company was called Fincluster, according to LinkedIn. “It was a small startup, yet we were doing really well,” he said.  His team  Tether’s leadership is a close-knit bunch. Ardoino met Giancarlo Devasini, a former plastic surgeon, in London in 2014. Devasini, now chief financial officer of Tether, had been running Bitfinex at the time and offered Ardoino a job. Stuart Hoegner, a Canadian who goes by @bitcoinlawyer on Twitter, has been general counsel at Bitfinex since 2014. Former CEO Jean-Louis van der Velde was also there from the start, and remains an advisor as well as CEO of Bitfinex.  This is the team that brought Tether to market, though the idea for the project was initially incubated by the Mastercoin team, led by entrepreneur, aspiring politician and former child actor Brock Pierce, under the name Realcoin. Pierce’s founding team, which included William Quigley, Reeve Collins and Craig Sellars, stepped away from the project early on. In some sense, the original idea for Tether was to be a stopgap solution for many companies in ""Bitcoin 2.0,"" as the crypto industry was known as at the time, that struggled to get access to banking services.  Tether would get banked, and supply private dollar equivalents to users. It initially promised to keep a corresponding amount of fiat in reserves to match the number of tokens in circulation. It is thought many of its early banking relationships were with regional banks in Taiwan, which used correspondent services from Wells Fargo (which Tether entered into litigation with in 2017 after the bank cut off its access). Tether has been accused of falsifying invoices and contracts in order to get and maintain banking relationships, and regulators in New York found the company would use accounts linked to its executives and ""friends of Bitfinex.""  Bitfinex is owned by Ifinex, which is headquartered in Hong Kong, and Tether is owned by DigiFinex, which is domiciled in Singapore. A Tether spokesperson clarified that these are distinct entities that share some mutual shareholders, but operate independently. ""This distinction is essential to provide a transparent and accurate representation of our corporate structure,"" the representative said in an email.  “For us, it was true, we got lucky, we know,” Ardoino said in an interview. “We are simple people and we are making good money with the company.” Though it hasn't always been easy.  Essentially, since the project was founded, Tether has been plagued by concerns about redemptions. In a 2021 episode of “Odd Lots,” convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, who owned the Alameda Research, a hedge fund known to be a major tether user at the time, described the redemption process as straight-forward though with the occasional hiccough.  The company has historically struggled to maintain banking access — at times using Noble Bank, which has connections to Pierce; the Bank of Montreal, where reportedly Hoegner banked; and a ""shadow bank"" known as Crypto Capital Corp. — though its current relationship with Deltec, in the Bahamas, has lasted for several years.  Ardoino said one of the most intense moments of his career was shortly after the collapse of the Terra/LUNA algorithmic stablecoin project founded by Do Kwon. Fir Tree Capital Management, a hedge fund had taken out a massive short against tether, a public bet the company would fail, at the time. The collapse of tether’s decentralized rival, UST, caused contagion elsewhere, and a massive uptick in withdrawals.  “We came out, I think, in great shape,” Ardoino said. The company processed around $7 billion worth withdrawals within 48 hours and over $20 billion over the next 20 days, or about 25% of the firm’s total holdings at the time. “It was quite an interesting moment. I'm quite fond of that moment, actually,” he said, reflectively. “It forced us to prove to the world that we actually were solid.”  Money to spend  Tether, at least this year, has money to spend. With a market cap just under $90 billion, an all-time high, it presumably has nearly $90 billion to hold in yield-earning banks accounts and invest prudently. Today, that means primarily in U.S. Treasuries, which are considered essentially risk-less. But it also invests in slightly riskier asset classes like repo agreements, money market funds and corporate bonds with a greater expected return. This year, it put over 1% of its holdings directly into bitcoin, which is new for the company.  Tether used to invest in commercial paper from companies in China, but stopped.  See also: Tether's Banking Relationships Detailed in Newly Released Docs  “We have a little bit of money to invest,” Ardoino said. In the first quarter of the year, Tether reported $700 million net profit in a voluntary attestation. In Q2: $850 million. In Q3: over $1 billion. With rising interest rates, it has never been more profitable to be in the stablecoin business, Ardoino said.  Tether has never been unseated as the largest stablecoin. However, this time last year, tether was losing market dominance compared to rivals including Circle’s USDC, Binance’s BUSD and, to a lesser extent, MakerDAO’s DAI (though tether was never dominant in DeFi, where dai reigns). This was in part due to regulatory headwinds and a controversial reputation.  In 2021, the New York Attorney General found that Tether was not always consistently “honest” about its reserve assets. Tether paid a $18.5 million fine to settle the charges. That same year, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said much the same, and fined the firm $41 million for making misrepresentations about its backing and bank accounts.  In October, Tether said it had $3.2 billion of excess reserves — that is money in abundance to the amount Tether would have to pay out if every single customer withdrew every single dollar from the platform. Tether also charges fees, $1,000 per withdrawal (with a $100,000 minimum). Ardoino said he takes an active role in deciding how the firm allocates its reserves, and what it invests in.  Funding the base  Under Ardoino’s leadership, Tether is positioning itself as an infrastructure provider. The company has made notable investments in bitcoin mining, as well as to construct hydropower facilities in Uruguay and geothermal facilities in El Salvador, which are intended to power bitcoin mining operations.  His skunkworks team is developing a Bitcoin node communications channel using the P2P protocol Keet, which will help “coordinate and manage miners and containers and energy production,” he said. The system is called Moria (yes, it is a “Lord of the Rings” reference, and, yes, Ardoino is a fan), and is pitched as bitcoin mining meets the “Internet of Things.”  “If you think about the mining side, that is an interesting side, because you have tens of thousands of miners and hundreds of thousands of sensors — temperature sensors, oil temperature sensors, wind sensors, light sensors. Everything is a sensor. Then you have the containers. They all produce data and they contribute to the stability of the system,” he said.  Although Ardoino doesn’t exactly have the time to micromanage the team, he is hands-on when it comes to R&D. He said he coded the first version of Moria himself. “I believe that it is important to showcase to others how you want things, rather than telling them. I like to be first-line, you know. I like to bootstrap and show my experience,” he said.  It’s clear, too, he had many ideas for how this general purpose technology could be applied. Ardoino discussed hypothetically building an alternative to chat apps like Telegram and WhatsApp. Keet, he said, could be a cost-effective way around those companies’ infrastructure and scalability needs. “Every Telegram user costs around 90 cents per year,” he said, doing back-of-the-napkin math of the server costs.  “Even if Keet had 1 billion users … BitTorrent proved that, with the hundreds of millions of users, it will not have any costs,” he said. “It’s peer-to-peer.” Keet does not bring in revenue, yet. But Ardoino seems willing to eat that cost, for now, saying there are only 20 people working on the software, meaning it costs somewhere in the ballpark of $4 million per year, at least for Tether.  Tether AI  Indeed, servers are likely on Ardoino’s mind because Tether recently invested in the E.U. data company Northern Data. Northern Data is a company with a somewhat mixed reputation in the bitcoin mining space. We asked about that, and Ardoino, laughing, said: “We have been the most criticized company in the world, so who am I to judge?”  There were also genuine business concerns driving the decision, including Northern’s deal with Nvidia that makes it poised to “become the biggest AI infrastructure provider in Europe if you remove Google, Amazon and Microsoft,” Ardoino said.  “Northern data will provide services to every single European company,” he said. “Every car manufacturer in Europe is trying to compete with Tesla, every shipping company in Europe is trying to optimize their routes and so on. Everyone is begging for AI infrastructure.”  Tether also has a small unit of less than five employees total doing research into AI, looking to see if there are applications that are useful for the company and whether it could construct its own cost-effective large language model, or LLM (the technology behind the contemporary generation of AI). Bitfinex and Tether together have employees in 60 different countries, Ardoino said, and he’s particularly interested in whether AI can help with the firms’ translation needs.  “We just started this process … We want to understand it really well before we scale up,” Ardoino said. AI infrastructure, of course, is tremendously expensive to operate — and even a company like Tether, which is on track to make over $4 billion this year, could soon find themselves scrounging for pennies (or raising capital from Microsoft).  See also: Tether Aims to Publish Reserve Data in Real-Time Reports  A fan of Azimov, known for his dystopian visions of artificial intelligence, Ardoino said that AI has the potential to create the biggest social unrest that “humanity has faced since the Industrial Revolution,” he said. It can enrich a few corporates at the expense of the many, destroy privacy as a human right and lead to mass layoffs.  Though he has criticisms of the Italian Way-of-Life, Ardoino keeps something of the European humanist mentality close. He said that Tether would resist firing employees just “because AI has made the job more efficient.” People have families, he said, adding “finance is not the only thing that matters.”  Stopping soon?  Ardoino has been at the helm for just a few months, and it doesn’t seem like he has plans to stop anytime soon. However, Tether, more than most companies in crypto, has regulatory headwinds, and it may not be his choice. Several sitting U.S. Senators have singled the company out, calling it a potential threat to national security. The U.S. Treasury hinted it is also eyeing the operation.  Of course, this is not new. Tether has gone through the regulatory wringer before and walked away with two slaps on the wrists. The firm was smaller then, of course, but it also had much more baggage to deal with. It’s true Tether lied to the public when it promised to hold all its reserves in dollars, but now it does not promise that. And, if it ever operated on fractional reserves (i.e. with fewer reserves than its deposits), it likely isn’t anymore.  Ardoino did not answer questions regarding potential regulatory action, or about whether the firm still intended to complete an audit.  “I don't plan to ever stop doing what I do today. Throughout my life, I have been in love with technology and science. I have seen what I can build alone and what wonderful projects I can deliver with a team. I wake up happy, even through challenging times. I feel blessed for the opportunity that I have. It allows me to plan and build so many of the ideas that I keep dreaming about. There is still so much to do,” Ardoino wrote in an email.  Whether or not Tether is stopped, either by market risks or by global regulators, one thing is clear. Ardoino, after nearly a decade without a proper vacation, could likely use a break.  “I never been to Japan. Japan is the country that created the first gaming consoles and videogames. They have an amazing culture. I find exploring and experiencing other cultures one of the most enriching opportunities in life,” he said.

42419051,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDVHB,1701693275,"Lido DAO Democratized ETH Staking, Then Dominated It","Depending on whom you ask, Lido is either Ethereum's best chance at staving off centralization, or accelerating that undesired fate.  On the one hand, Lido, a liquid staking provider on Ethereum, may have done more than any other to expand access to staking – the process that helps keep the second-most-valuable blockchain up and running.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  But it's also become a lightning rod for criticism, with skeptics alleging the group has accomplished the opposite of its stated goal of safeguarding the network’s decentralization, and instead amassed a dangerous amount of power to itself.  Either way, Lido DAO has earned a spot among CoinDesk's Most Influential list for 2023.  Lido’s role in Ethereum staking  User deposits into Lido have climbed precipitously since it launched in December 2020, just as Ethereum was gearing up to abandon its power-hungry crypto mining system in favor of ""staking""– a newer, more energy-efficient method for powering the blockchain.  Ethereum had recently opened up the ability for users to ""stake"" 32 ether – depositing it into an address on the blockchain in exchange for a steady stream of interest. The rewards came in exchange for help ""validating"" the up-and-coming version of the Ethereum chain, which went live in September 2022.  High up-front costs (32 ETH was worth $100,000 at the market's peak) and technical complexity made staking a challenging proposition for many, however. It was also impossible to withdraw staked ETH until an update that didn’t come until this year, so staking in the early days meant locking up a huge sum of ETH for an indeterminate amount of time.  Lido offered a solution. Staking became as easy as handing any sum of ETH to the protocol, which pooled it with funds from users from around the world in order to reach the 32 ETH threshold. Lido's third-party partners handled all the technical nitty-gritty of setting up a ""node"" to earn interest – simplifying the process drastically for end-users.  Lido also allowed users to stay liquid. It gave out a derivative token, ""staked ether"" (stETH), representing funds staked via the protocol. This stETH accrued interest and tended to trade around the price of normal ETH – essentially offering the same benefits of staking in a package that could be bought or sold at any time.  Today, the value of deposits into Lido surpasses $9 billion, and stETH is the largest decentralized finance token by market capitalization. Lido's boosters say the product has helped keep Ethereum staking from falling into the hands of a few large actors.  The future of Lido and decentralized governance  Lido's governance by a DAO – a decentralized autonomous organization of the project's LDO token-holders – means core decisions about how the protocol evolves are determined by community votes, rather than top-down directives from a company. Lido also works to decentralize its infrastructure, divvying up user deposits across dozens of third parties as a bulwark against centralized control.  But Lido has gradually become a victim of its own success, with the DAO attracting criticism as it has grown to dominate Ethereum's staking landscape. Lido currently commands 32% of all ether staked. This puts it just below a critical 33% threshold; if a single entity controls this much staked ETH, it could, theoretically, influence certain elements of how the chain operates.  The DAO has rejected a community proposal to cap the amount of ETH Lido will stake. Its supporters say Ethereum would be worse off if a big company – say, the crypto exchanges Coinbase or Binance – amassed the 33% instead of a community-led protocol that splits its operations between third parties.  However it proceeds, LDO token-holders have tremendous influence over how proof-of-stake blockchains like Ethereum continue to develop, and the group will be looked to by other DAOs as the world of decentralized governance continues to mature.",NEUTRAL,ETH | LDO,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING | LDO,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/lido-dao-democratized-eth-staking-then-dominated-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/21cc9cf55a920b407a8dfa08d502e8a2a35ecf97-350x350.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42419068,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDVXh,1701693244,Jenny Johnson Has 76-Year-Old Franklin Templeton Learning Blockchain Tricks,"The old-school vibe is right there in Franklin Templeton's logo: Benjamin Franklin staring at the viewer from the 18th century. That's not all. BEN is the company's stock ticker symbol. ""Templeton"" is an allusion to Sir John Templeton, the investing legend born in 1912. And a single family has always been in control of the business. Today, Jenny Johnson is at the helm, following her brother, father and grandfather, who founded what's now known as Franklin Templeton in 1947.  It feels like a company rooted in the past, so it's no wonder that when Franklin Templeton asked people how they felt about the brand in 2020, the year Jenny Johnson ascended to CEO, a common response was ""old-fashioned,"" according to The Financial Times.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here.  And, yet, Johnson has pushed this $1.33 trillion asset manager toward the front of Wall Street's embrace of the very modern field of cryptocurrencies – or at least the parts she likes. Franklin Templeton has joined other finance heavyweights like BlackRock and Fidelity in applying to list a bitcoin ETF in the U.S. It offers a money-market fund, a type of investment product that serves as bedrock in conventional investing, that processes transactions and tracks ownership on public blockchains. It lets clients buy crypto. It even has nodes on several proof-of-stake blockchains including Ethereum, Solana and Stellar, meaning this 76-year-old company helps power networks that, in age terms, are at best just starting grade school.  In traditional finance, or TradFi, terms, she's all-in on crypto. However, she is most definitely not into the whole space. Don't hold your breath waiting for a Franklin Templeton Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT Fund; she's even downplayed the original cryptocurrency, bitcoin (BTC).  ""I often say, 'Bitcoin is the greatest distraction from the greatest disruption,'"" Johnson said in an interview released by Morgan Stanley in September 2022. (All direct quotes in this story from Johnson come from this Morgan Stanley interview unless specified otherwise. Johnson was not available for an interview with CoinDesk before this story was written.) Although ""currency"" is part of the word ""cryptocurrency,"" she doesn't think these digital assets will replace conventional currencies. ""Governments will always want to control their currencies, so it'll never get so big to disrupt that,"" she said.  Instead, what excites her is the prospect that the ledger technology, blockchain, that all of crypto is built atop could create new business models in finance.  To understand what that means, it helps to remember the takeover spree she has been on since becoming Franklin Templeton's CEO, including the marquee purchase of Legg Mason. These deals have made her company a player in ""alternative"" investments, industry jargon for hedge funds, private equity, real estate, firms other than banks lending money and more. As of Oct. 31, it had $253.8 billion of assets in that area.  Whereas stocks, U.S. Treasuries and gold are relatively easy for just about anyone to buy, alternatives are an exclusive club. An enticing prospect for any financial institution looking for the next vein to mine for profits would be broadening access. For Johnson, that's where tokenization comes into play. This concept, which is drawing a lot of Wall Street's attention these days, involves representing ownership of real-world assets like, say, a Manhattan apartment building or a privately held company through tokens that can be traded and tracked via a blockchain. (Though U.S. regulators, who famously want to heavily regulate digital assets they deem securities, might have something to say about that.)  Tokenization will be ""a really important part of the democratization of alternatives,"" Johnson said.  Tokenization has quickly become a finance buzzword in 2023, muscling out the word ""crypto."" A trade group for the derivatives business called the Futures Industry Association holds several conferences a year. Crypto was a fairly popular topic at the November 2022 event in Chicago, held days after Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX blew up. ""Crypto"" appeared in the title or description of eight speeches and panels. That dwindled to just one at the Chicago gathering in October 2023, though there was also one on tokenization, so crypto made a stealthy additional appearance.  Hopes are high. Digital asset management firm 21.co recently said that the tokenization of real-world assets could grow to be a $10 trillion market by 2030.  From New Jersey to Silicon Valley  Johnson grew up in New Jersey. Around the age of nine, she moved to California. She got an economics degree from the University of California, Davis. Johnson wanted to pursue a career in financial services. Her father, Charlie Johnson, urged her to begin that career in New York City, the center of finance in the U.S. So, she worked for a year at Drexel Burnham and lived in Jersey City.  Then she joined Franklin Templeton, which is headquartered in the Silicon Valley town of San Mateo, California, in 1988 and never left. She started as executive administrative coordinator to the chief operating officer, a job she describes as: ""I did whatever I was sent to do."" Later, she ran a credit-card business and then an auto-loan division. ""I know more about consumer lending than anything else,"" she said. At one time or another, she ran all the company's major divisions – investment management, distribution, technology, operations and wealth management – before becoming CEO.  This is not, of course, the background of a crypto degen addled by memes, Discord battles and the latest altcoin fad. (That said, Franklin Templeton's venture-capital arm invested in Discord, the chat app popular in the crypto realm.) But TradFi and crypto are intersecting, so the Jenny Johnsons of finance will undoubtedly have to rub shoulders with crypto-natives. Their goals are often different. Go back to the beginning of crypto: Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin white paper in 2008 envisioned creating a peer-to-peer system to convey money ""without going through a financial institution."" In other words, TradFi is joining an ecosystem that sought to undermine it. As those two worlds get closer, friction is inevitable.  But Johnson can sound like an idealist when she talks about what blockchains can do. From the start, Bitcoin aimed to create a financial system in which you didn't need to trust the person you're trading with. You could feel secure doing this on the Bitcoin network because of cryptographic proof, regardless of the trustworthiness of your counterparty.  ""Blockchain is a technology, and it's pretty efficient,"" Johnson said. ""A transaction can happen with embedded trust. There are many roles that people have in financial services that validate, so that if you and I transact, you know you can count on it. A title company helps to ensure that there's property. Investment bankers doing certain things around making sure that the ownership is transferred appropriately. Blockchain allows it to be embedded with a smart contract in the code. And a token is just the code that says, 'When I transact it to you, you can count on a lot of those things being embedded.'""  The main takeaway is this: Here's a prominent TradFi figure hinting that finance stuff can be moved over to blockchains. Yes, people on Wall Street have been dreaming and talking about this kind of thing for the better part of a decade, with little to show for it. Nonetheless, Johnson is a prominent person and her beliefs matter.  She's taking the long view. ""Some of the stuff we're doing in the blockchain space won't be material to the firm for seven to 10 years, but we think it's really important that we're doing it now,"" Johnson said during an episode of the ""Masters in Business"" podcast from July 2023.  Ben Franklin would probably approve. In 1735, he wrote: ""Look before, or you'll find yourself behind.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,Nick Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/12/04/franklin-templeton-jenny-johnson-crypto-innovation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fbfad31152d50e517a089f0b8c83aae9b4a9fced-350x350.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42419054,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDVKH,1701693224,Ryan Selkis Goes to Washington,"In public, Ryan Selkis is one of crypto's loudest gadflies, regularly excoriating U.S. regulators for overreach, especially Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, in social media tirades.  Behind the scenes, the founder and CEO of data and analytics provider Messari has spent the last two years building a political fundraising machine for the industry that's gearing up to sway elections in 2024.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here. Selkis is a speaker at CoinDesk's Consensus 2024 festival, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.  Selkis recently handed off this work to Fairshake, a political action committee (PAC). It wields a war chest of about $15 million, a person close to the situation said. (Numbers won't be disclosed in federal filings until January.) Brian Armstrong, CEO of leading U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, said in October he personally gave Fairshake $1 million and hoped the PAC could raise $50 million or more.  Fairshake has begun putting those funds to work; Politico reported in November that the PAC spent $1.2 million in recent months on television ads for House candidates.  For laying the groundwork for this political blitz, CoinDesk has named Selkis one of the 10 Most Influential people in crypto for 2023.  Time will tell how well the PAC achieves its goals of filling open House and Senate seats with pro-crypto candidates, re-electing crypto-friendly incumbents and unseating hostile ones. But in Selkis' view, his combative public style has already been vindicated.  ""In 2021, it seemed like I was crazy,"" Selkis said in an interview in early November. ""Now it's common sentiment across the industry that [Gensler is] really not a good actor operating in good faith by any stretch.""  It has indeed been a humbling year for Gensler, whose SEC suffered setbacks in its court battles with crypto companies such as Ripple and Grayscale. Gensler has also come under scrutiny for cozy interactions with Sam Bankman-Fried during the heyday of FTX, years before that crypto exchange collapsed and its CEO was convicted on federal fraud charges.  It is also true that in 2021, Selkis did seem a little crazy – or, at least, hotheaded and impolitic.  Declaring 'war'  In September of that year, near the height of the last bull market, Selkis posted on Twitter (now known as X) that he had decided to run for Senate and declared ""war on our out-of-control regulatory state.""  The proximate trigger for his salvo was a subpoena the SEC had served the day before to a crypto executive about to walk onstage at Messari's annual Mainnet conference in New York. (The subpoenaed party was later identified as Do Kwon, founder of the TerraUSD stablecoin that collapsed the following year, whom the SEC eventually charged with fraud, and who is now languishing in a Montenegrin prison while the U.S. and South Korea fight for his extradition.)  ""If you're wondering when I actually decided to run for Senate, it was when these f--kers came to my event, didn't buy a ticket, and served one of the speakers a subpoena,"" Selkis tweeted. ""Enough talk. … Selkis 2024. Time to activate the crypto political machine.""  That evening, I received an anxious text from a crypto industry lawyer.  ""Selkis is really doing damage,"" this attorney, who had previously worked in the more genteel field of banking, told me. ""He has been antagonizing Gensler … He is out of control, fanning fires unnecessarily.""  To Selkis, however, policymakers like Gensler and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) never needed antagonizing; they had it in for crypto from the get-go.  ""This year, we've seen just how one-sided the narrative is, and how punitive some policymakers are,"" Selkis told me in November. ""It's not tinfoil-hat anymore to think that 'they're out to get us' when someone like Elizabeth Warren is literally putting out campaign ads that say she's raising money and building an anti-crypto army.""  The November 2022 collapse of FTX did the industry no favors in the public eye or in Washington, D.C. But Selkis argues last year's crypto crash is not the only reason for a slew of aggressive enforcement actions from the SEC and antagonistic legislation like Warren's bill, which would extend customer-identification requirements to miners and wallet providers.  ""The opposition to crypto is more than just a reaction or overreaction to some of the fraud and bankruptcies from last year,"" he said. ""It's much more philosophical. Crypto is just one issue that that radical anti-tech philosophy is going to impact.""  Selkis never ran for Senate (he told me he seriously considered it but had no shot in any of the states he could credibly run in). He still saw a need for a more muscular crypto presence in Washington than the handful of trade associations and think tanks that have represented the industry for the last decade or so.  ""They'd have productive meetings with policymakers, and then that policymaker would more likely than not look at their watch and say, 'Oh, this has been a great conversation, but I gotta jet early so that I can go to a fundraiser with the bankers' association,'"" Selkis said. ""And that's just kind of the reality of how D.C. operates.""  Most crypto executives, he said, were naive in underestimating the importance of political donations and vehicles like PACs. With one unfortunate exception.  'Chaotic good'  Sam Bankman-Fried was a prolific political donor, showering politicians with tens of millions in campaign contributions before his FTX empire imploded in November 2022. During his heyday, he was often cast as a long-needed diplomat who, disheveled appearance notwithstanding, could hold constructive dialogue with Washington, unlike the anarchists and techbros long associated with crypto.  ""The media and D.C. establishment – not the industry by any stretch – basically anointed him as our representative and it blew up in our face,"" Selkis said.  Now facing decades in prison for misusing FTX customers' funds, the former golden boy has become crypto's greatest embarrassment, a title for which there is no shortage of competition.  For Selkis, the irony is delicious, particularly because Bankman-Fried had been aggressively lobbying for a bill that detractors said would have killed decentralized finance (DeFi) in the U.S. and entrenched centralized platforms like FTX.  ""Some of the very worst folks that we've had to deal with as an industry and some of the folks that have since been sued for fraud, or have now been convicted in Sam's case … they were seen as the 'adults' and it was because, of course, they didn't fight,"" Selkis said.  ""They were trying to basically capture these folks in D.C. that would ultimately give them a pass or a monopoly,"" he went on. ""By currying favor and kissing ass, they were willing to sell basically anyone out, including their customers, in some cases. But they always said the nice things.""  Referring to the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, Selkis said he'd rather be ""the chaotic good than the lawful evil.""  Swing voter's issue?  Tweets aside, Selkis' big splash as an aspiring political kingmaker was appearing on Fox News' Tucker Carlson Tonight in February 2022. Appealing to the populist sensibilities of the host and audience, Selkis cast crypto as a check on Big Government, Big Banks and Big Tech, and contrasted decentralized systems like Bitcoin with the centralized digital currency created by the Chinese Communist Party.  He concluded by telling Carlson he had founded the Digital Freedom Alliance (DFA) to advance pro-crypto policies – and more importantly, to support pro-crypto candidates.  ""This is going to be a swing voter's issue, with 50 million Americans owning crypto, and quite a bit of single-issue voters, myself included, among that cohort,"" Selkis predicted. ""It's a nonpartisan issue too, Tucker,"" he added, just before the segment ended.  (The 50 million figure, which implies one in five U.S. adults own crypto, later appeared in a survey commissioned by Coinbase. Better Markets, an advocacy group, questioned the findings, noting that the 2,202 respondents included an oversample, or deliberate addition, of 500 crypto investors.)  When I spoke to Selkis in November, I asked if there were really enough single-issue crypto voters to make a difference – particularly now, after a brutal bear market. Even if there are 50 million American crypto holders, surely a nontrivial portion of them are underwater on their investments or have been burned by bankrupt exchanges and lenders.  He said the truly significant cohort was a subset of those with portfolios. ""Maybe at best, it's a wash, whether the number of people that own crypto helps or hurts us,"" Selkis acknowledged. ""But when you think about the folks who really have made [crypto] either their livelihood or just philosophically feel very strongly [in favor of it],"" there are enough to tip the balance in key races.  ""Certain states are only won or lost by tens of thousands of votes,"" he said. ""So you don't need to have 50 million people become single-issue voters. You only need a couple hundred thousand in the right areas.""  'Outspent by pipe welders'  Selkis stressed to me he favors ""common-sense regulation"" and comprehensive bipartisan legislation that would promote healthy competition while protecting investors. Pretending crypto will never be regulated is ""childish,"" he said.  The lack of clear guardrails encouraged risk-taking in the last crypto bubble, Selkis argued. For example, the SEC's reluctance to approve an exchange-traded fund (ETF) backed by bitcoin forced investors simply looking for BTC exposure to buy coins on offshore exchanges like FTX and Binance, he said.  By April 2023, Selkis was setting audacious goals for the DFA, tweeting that he would raise $100 million. An article in Barron's noted this would have been more than the powerful National Association of Realtors spent lobbying Congress in 2022.  In October, when he appeared with Coinbase's Armstrong at Mainnet 2023, Selkis sounded humbler in his ambitions, saying crypto first needed to catch up with established industries in political spending.  ""These super PACs in other industries can raise $50 million, $100 million,"" he said. ""I mean, we're getting outspent by like the f**king pipe welders of Ohio right now."" (Not as hyperbolic as it sounds: Building trade union PACs as a group gave $13.5 million to candidates during the 2022 election cycle, according to OpenSecrets.)  Selkis declared from the outset of his campaign that he didn't want to go into politics full-time. Building Messari, the data and analytics company he started in 2018 with head of engineering Diran Li and chief revenue officer Eric Turner, would always be the first priority. A funding round last fall valued the firm at $300 million.  By the time he spoke at Mainnet in October, Selkis had handed over most fundraising work to Michael Carcaise, a political operative whose GMI PAC spent about $12 million in the 2022 election cycle supporting pro-tech candidates in general and has begun to support pro-crypto candidates through Fairshake.  ""Mike and his team did a great job picking the districts, picking the seats, last time around, that they were going to go after and try to support candidates on an early basis,"" Selkis told Armstrong. Of the 23 candidates indirectly backed by Carcaise's GMI (through his Web3 Forward and Crypto Innovation PACs) last year, 19 won general elections and three lost primaries, according to public data compiled by OpenSecrets. (One more fell just short of winning a primary with 49% of the vote, then dropped out of the runoff after an infidelity scandal.)  Although he's handed Carcaise the reins, don't expect Selkis to hold his tongue on policy matters. Another reason he is so outspoken, he said, is that as an information provider, Messari has less to lose than a regulated financial services company living in fear of enforcement actions.

42419060,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDVOP,1701693207,Casey Rodarmor: The Bitcoin Artist,"Casey Rodarmor is not starving, but he is an artist. And like many intellectuals, he cuts a decisive figure. It's not that Rodarmor is looking to anger; he simply found something that he thought needed doing. Unfortunately, many of his contemporaries have simply not caught up.  If you're not up to speed: This year, Rodarmor, a long-time Bitcoiner who has made actual code commits to Bitcoin Core, unveiled what he calls Ordinals Theory. In popular parlance, Ordinals are often referred to as ""NFTs on Bitcoin."" It's a phrase that might make Rodarmor, a California native, with as sunny a disposition as he can be ornery, shudder.  This profile is part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2023. For the full list, click here. Rodarmor is a speaker at CoinDesk's Consensus 2024 festival.

Holders of a Most Influential NFT will receive a Pro Pass ticket to Consensus 2024 in Austin, Texas. To learn more about Consensus, click here.  ""It's one of the worst acronyms I've ever heard,"" Rodarmor said, referring to the initialism for non-fungible tokens, in an interview in early November. ""First of all, it's very financial for something that is, like, actually interesting and artistic. And then you tell them what the acronym stands for and they don't know what it means. Fungible? And then it's a negation. It's just terrible.""  He said he strives to use ""evocative, interesting language"" that ""accurately describes"" what he's talking about. That's why his preferred term for ""Bitcoin NFTs"" is ""digital artifacts."" At times, you might also hear terms like ""inscriptions,"" or ""rare sats"" (short for satoshis, the smallest denomination of BTC) or ""digital art objects.""  I don't mean to be a massive pedantic a--hole.  ""I don't mean to be a massive pedantic a--hole,"" he said. But language matters to the high school dropout. His mother is an author and his father a former editor at PC World Magazine. He grew up with words counting for something and a lot of computers around, though he didn't learn how to code until he mostly taught himself later in life.  ""Personally it kind of irks me, but I can't do anything about it, that people don't distinguish between ordinals and inscriptions,"" he said.  Indeed, what is the difference? It might be best to start at the beginning.  Bitcoin Ordinals vs. inscriptions  First, there was Bitcoin, the distributed computing network that ushered in a private, digital currency called bitcoin into the world. Bitcoin can be sent peer-to-peer, or directly, without an intermediary. It is a protocol and a currency that many users, including Rodarmor, like because there is a finite number of bitcoins (21 million). Altogether, this means Bitcoin is resistant to censorship and inflation.  ""I don't really have a 'hard money' or 'gold bug' background. But I think it would probably be good if we had money that didn't inflate,"" Rodarmor, born in 1983, said. He added that he became politically aware in his 20s, and that he thinks ""the government is incompetent … because they have bad incentives.""  Bitcoiners rejoice. You may not like to hear it, but Rodarmor is one of you.  Indeed, many Bitcoiners this year described Rodarmor as an enemy of Bitcoin, because of the Ordinals Protocol he built that allows people to ""inscribe"" data onto bitcoins. This, Ordinals critics allege, breaks the fungibility of bitcoin (in a similar way that if a coin is badly scratched, some people may not want to cash it), reduces privacy (a marked coin is an identifier) and clutters the chain (NFTs have a reputation for being frivolous junk).  Rodarmor, obviously, disagrees. He used to be far more willing to engage with critics and to try to educate them. For instance, in a Q&A on the Stacker News forum in January, shortly after Ordinals launched, he responded to a question raised about how inscriptions will interfere with bitcoin's exchangeability.  That a marked sat is less fungible ""is probably sort of true,"" he wrote, ""but it's not actually a problem in practice, since everyone can just ignore ordinal numbers and inscriptions."" Ordinals Theory is essentially just a ""lens"" for properly ordering satoshis in order to view inscriptions, that is, should anyone choose to ""inscribe"" a ""digital art object"" onto a satoshi.  ""Satoshis are uninscribed when they come into the world, unstamped metal rounds that can be pressed into a coin,"" Rodarmor said in a podcast in March.  In fact, Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, added a similar feature to Ordinals in one of the protocol's early codebases. Although it was eventually removed, former Bitcoin developer Jeremy Rubin found an ""atoms"" function that would doctor up a random bitcoin once per block, which would make a scarce asset even more scarce.  Bitcoin's Taproot update  Likewise, contrary to popular belief, the Ordinals protocol could have been built for Bitcoin beginning on ""day one,"" Rodarmor said. It has become common wisdom that the ability to ""inscribe"" these assets was only unlocked after the so-called Taproot update last year, which created a new transaction type for the network.  The Taproot upgrade helped, but the Ordinals protocol was always possible, if only someone had the idea.  Meet Rhett Mankind, the artist who created the image of Casey Rodarmor for Most Influential 2023.  Rodarmor's inspiration came from his interest in generative art, work that is created autonomously using prefabricated algorithms, which has taken on a particular life of its own within the NFT scene, and his desire to create his own generative artworks.  Although he was quite taken by some of the artists working on Ethereum, in particular ""Art Blocks"" creator Erick Calderon, when he went to code his own smart contract on the system, he walked away feeling disgusted. ""Terrible usability,"" he said.  So he decided to make his own version on Bitcoin. ""The idea behind this project was like 'Oh, wouldn't it be cool if I can make and sell my own digital art? And so, you know, of course, I got massively sidetracked"" building the protocol, he said. The plan is still to generate art eventually, but at the time of our interview he said he had made ""a grand total of one inscription.""  He said these types of all-consuming projects have happened in the past. About a decade ago, for instance, he started working on a musical instrument that used capacitive sensors and a microcomputer that you could play with your hands, not unlike a theremin.  ""I went through this whole fabrication phase where I was making silicone pads with embedded conductive fabrics and using a laser cutter to get these different shapes of metal and pouring rubber molds to make control surfaces…"" he said. He said he hasn't touched the instrument since.  There was also a phase where he was making visuals for electronic music, programming everything from ""scratch."" Most recently, he's been making pottery.  Rodarmor said he's especially attracted to art that serves a purpose; if something is purely ""conceptual,"" he said it can be boring. At the same time, however, his favorite works are ""large-scale, abstract metal sculpture."" Essentially anything that is austere and geometric.  Though he never said as much, it's clear that coding for Rodarmor is a type of art. Or at least it can be an artistic process. In fact, he described his ""processes"" for creating spinning pottery wheels and coding trance-like visuals in almost the exact same way.  ""It's about sitting there and writing an algorithm and tweaking it over and over and over again until you get something new,"" he said.  Code can obviously be functional, and, in most cases, it is. Software development has essentially been Rodarmor's only job over the years (outside of a stint of odd jobs working at a clothing store call Mr. Rags, as a film projectionist in Berkeley and video game tester around the time the Gameboy Advance came out before he got California's version of a GED). He worked for a stint at Google, and later at Chaincode Labs.  Ordinals, for him, was a labor of love. He had saved up a bit of a nest egg working his previous tech jobs that allowed him to fund development. He told me, and has said in other interviews, he's received tips in bitcoin, but he's not sure if that ""took him out of the red.""  And while Ordinals has been uniquely successful – at time of writing, there have been more than 45 million inscriptions made, generating just under $1 billion in total fees on the Bitcoin network, according to data on Dune Analytics – it can often feel like unappreciated work.  This summer, Rodarmor essentially went dark. After doing months of interviews (including for this publication) and podcasts and reaping the hate of Bitcoiners who despise Ordinals on social media, he felt like he needed to step back. At the time, he said, he wasn't sure if he'd return.  Part of the issue was just the fundamental unseriousness of the conflict. Bitcoin is an open-source project that anyone can adapt, and Ordinals is a protocol that you can choose to use or not. Getting mad at Rodarmor is as pointless as getting mad at BlackRock for ""corrupting"" the ethos of Bitcoin by applying to launch an ETF.  Plus, before Ordinals there was no convincing use for Bitcoin that would generate the fees that will eventually be necessary to pay for the network's ""security"" once the ""subsidy"" runs out. Every ""digital art object"" inscribed on-chain means fees are going into miners' pockets, who pay for the specialized chips and electricity that keep Bitcoin humming.  ""The most interesting thing with ordinals is forcing bitcoin to reckon with the 'is blockspace solely for native transactions' debate,"" Castle Island Venture partner Nic Carter said in a direct message. ""If the NFT community embraces Ordinals as a top-3 NFT system, I could see it being a meaningful share of Bitcoin's long-term block space, say 20% over long periods.""  The 'Mad Max of capitalism'  This is the case whether you view inscriptions as art or junk. But in either case, Bitcoin was created to be a free-for-all, the ""Mad Max of capitalism,"" as Rodarmor said, meaning that if you can pay, you can play and use the blockchain for whatever you want.  This is to say nothing of the legitimate technical advantage the Ordinals Theory represents for NFTs. In almost all cases, on other chains, NFTs are just blockchain signatures appended to media without that media being appended to the blockchain. There have already been cases where an NFT project was lost after the website hosting the content has gone down.  That's partially why a few NFT projects, including the highly influential Bored Apes series by Yuga Labs, have recreated themselves on Bitcoin. OnChainMonkeys went a step further and abandoned its original series that initially launched on Ethereum.  ""Due to their longevity, inscriptions [may] become the first digital form of high art, and the most important form of digital art ever created,"" Rodarmor wrote in the Q&A interview shortly after Ordinals launched.  To be sure, Ordinals are not without their problems. Part of the reason Rodarmor re-emerged from his sabbatical this fall was because a massive flaw with how some ordinals are indexed was uncovered. It was the result of a mistake he made while coding the project, and because Ordinals is immutable it cannot be changed.  Rodarmor calls affected inscriptions ""cursed"" and initially proposed a way to ""bless them"" by renumbering the assets, in the first blog he published upon his return. This idea caused rancor among collectors who bought or created inscriptions specifically for their ""rare"" placement in the Ordinals register.  He and Raphjaph, the developer to whom Rodarmor handed off the ORD protocol, instead decided to address the issue for all inscriptions going forward but not retroactively. The whole process of making a mistake in public code and then working to address the issue by taking on feedback from users is something new for Rodarmor.  It's also been an ""iterative process"" learning to live with the love and hate of launching such an influential and contentious bit of software. Rodarmor said he's an avid attendee of Bitcoin Meetups, and that in person most Bitcoiners either love the idea of Ordinals or are indifferent. It's only online where the scale and anonymity of the feedback can be overwhelming.  ""Casey is the most knowledgeable bitcoiner I've ever met, He literally knows everything about bitcoin and has been obsessed with it for like a decade,"" Erin Redwing, co-host of Rodarmor's podcast ""Hell Money,"" said in a text message. ""He would never self-describe this way, btw. He's very humble.""  Indeed, a BIP, or Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, Rodarmor applied for Ordinals still has not been accepted by Bitcoin Core developers, even though it is not making a formal change to the codebase, just a way to formally document ""what has already happened,"" he said. He laughs about it nowadays.  ""I'm the kind of person that if I'm not working on something, I'm often bored and kind of depressed,"" he said ""So being back working on it makes me happy.""

""Many established Layer 1 (L1) public blockchain networks have encountered significant hurdles; Ethereum faced the DAO hack, Solana experienced network outages, and Bitcoin underwent hard forks,"" said James Wo, founder at crypto fund DFG in a Telegram message to CoinDesk.  ""Despite facing a supposedly fatal blowup event, it didn't undermine the strength of the community and the technology at its core. Terra stands out as a community filled with motivated and skilled individuals. Through strategic realignment and adaptability, they are demonstrating resilience and unwavering belief in the Terra ecosystem. It's a story worth watching,"" Wo added.  Three tokens, Luna Classic [LUNC], terra 2.0 [LUNA] and terraUSD classic [USTC], have jumped as much as 70% in the past 24 hours, extending weekly gains to more than 300%.  Cumulative trading volumes crossed the $2 billion mark, data from CoinGecko shows.  Terra Classic is the original network created by Terraform Labs. It has continued as an independent blockchain rather than Terra 2.0, which is a forked version that was created in the wake of Terra's collapse. Terra 2.0’s LUNA is now actively traded on the market, and so are Terra Classic’s LUNC and USTC, the original tokens.  These pumps came on various catalysts. Last week, Terraform Labs said it had put $15 million towards two projects in the Terra ecosystem to buffer up liquidity, making certain trading pools on those platforms more attractive for on-chain traders.  Last month, Bitcoin-focused payment project Mint Cash said it was working on a USTC revamp plan that would use bitcoin [BTC] to back its intended dollar-pegged stability. The team said it would also have an airdrop plan in place for LUNC and USTC holders.  Meanwhile, crypto exchange Binance continued to a burn scheme that permanently removes LUNC from circulating supply based on transactional fees earned on LUNC trading pairs.  In June, six engineers calling themselves the “Six Samurai” proposed a Terra Classic ecosystem revival plan for the blockchain – such as a terraUSD testnet for testing financial services, an application for generating yield to token holders, and a plan to reward developers for the user activity that their applications generate.

42419059,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDVNN,1701691483,"Asset Manager Abrdn, Crypto Exchange Archax Strive for Pole Position in Race to Tokenize TradFi","Imagine a token that denotes ownership in a money-market fund, works like a yield-bearing stablecoin and can also be posted as collateral for trades. That's where U.K. investment firm abrdn and regulated exchange Archax are in the race to tokenize traditional assets.  Archax, one of the first crypto firms to be regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and abrdn, with $626 billion of assets under management, went live with an institutional-grade money-market fund token back in October. The two are now putting it to use, lining up customers looking for new and flexible ways to allocate capital.  Big financial firms have realized there are a host of operational and cost-saving efficiencies to be had by representing assets on blockchains, but few have gone far beyond the conceptual testing phase.  Clients have to be onboarded, wallets have to be whitelisted, and the token is available only to professional investors, Simon Barnby, Archax’s chief marketing officer, said in an interview. But the tokenized tranche of the abrdn fund, which uses the Hedera Hashgraph ledger, is available for as little as $5,000, potentially opening up the product to a new channel of investors.  “There’s about a $400 million pipeline of customers whose interest has been thoroughly piqued,” Barnby said. “We’re talking to a lot of payment firms, and a lot of people who are perhaps sitting on a stablecoin like USDC or USDT, which doesn’t generate any yield. In previous years, when interest rates were low, treasury functions of businesses were not so worried about where the money was and if it was generating any return. But now they want to put their assets to work.”  The onset of a higher interest-rate environment is changing patterns of innovation. Not only is this accelerating tokenization plans focused on low-hanging fruit like treasury bonds, it’s also garnering a response from decentralized finance (DeFi), trending toward new models of yield-bearing stablecoins.  Early next year, Archax will introduce trading pairs of the abrdn money-market fund (MMF) token and bitcoin [BTC]. In other words, rather than trading BTC against the U.S. dollar or USDC, users can trade bitcoin against U.S. dollar MMF tokens.  The obvious next step (but something the firms have not spoken about publicly until now) is using the MMF ownership token as collateral.  “This is what happens in the DeFi world, where people borrow against assets, lend assets out,” Barnby said. “A token that represents ownership in the money-market fund could be used as collateral in an area like regulated DeFi, which is an area we’re looking at for next year.”  The somewhat diminished DeFi universe is interesting, but it’s just a speck on the landscape compared with the scale of traditional markets.  Abrdn has a long pipeline of financial products to tokenize, the firm’s alternative investments leader Duncan Moir pointed out, but wanted to start out with “something straightforward,” where there's already demand, with the expectation it would be for the crypto native investors.  “The stablecoin replacement was a no-brainer when there’s 5% getting left on the table,” Moir said in an interview.  Following discussions with more and more institutions, it became clear that posting for collateral is potentially a larger use case, Moir added.  “Swap dealers accept money-market funds, so it could be used to post margin on a swap, for example,” Moir said. “Looking ahead, I'll be interested to see if it can be used for settlement of tokenized securities. I can certainly imagine a future where there are other tokenized funds, and this as the cash asset you’re trading against makes a lot of sense.”  UPDATE (Dec. 4, 12:59 UTC): Adds Hedera Hashgraph in fourth paragraph.",POSITIVE,BTC | USDC,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | USDC,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/04/asset-manager-abrdn-crypto-exchange-archax-strive-for-pole-position-in-race-to-tokenize-tradfi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0092b1edf8d46f6e0ed063ac165dfe3a16d5e779-1200x837.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

21040936,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563752,1701691238,"Shiba Inu Price Enters Most Crucial Week In 1.5 Years, Here’s Why","The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price is entering a week that has the potential to be the most important week in 1.5 years. As explained in previous analyses, SHIB has shown conflicting patterns in the weekly chart: a bullish quadruple bottom and a descending triangle. This week, the situation could be resolved and the bullish chart pattern may be validated. At press time, SHIB traded at $0.00000933. Thus, the Shiba Inu price broke above the descending trendline of the triangle pattern. Why SHIB Enters The Most Crucial Week In 1.5 Years The quadruple bottom pattern has formed over the extended period of 1.5 years, with the price touching the support zone between $0.00000715 and $0.000006 four times, creating an ultra-strong base. Over the last 18 months, it suggested a strong level of support, as SHIB has consistently bounced off this price point, indicating a reluctance to move lower. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Ripple: Massive $300 Billion Transfer Sends Crypto Community Into Speculation The descending triangle, characterized by a flat lower-bound support level at $0.00000715 and a down-sloping upper-bound resistance trendline, has acted as strong resistance. The price has been rejected at the resistance line a total of 10 times since last year. As the price pushed above this trendline, a weekly close above this line could signify the commencement of a bullish reversal. Moreover, the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA – orange line) also played a crucial role. On the occasions when SHIB was able to break out above the descending trend line of the triangle (on the lower time frames), it never managed to close the week above this indicator. This week, SHIB bulls have a new chance. While SHIB is already trading above the descending trendline of the triangle, the price still has to close above the 50-week EMA at $0.00000973 next Sunday. If it succeeds, this would mark an unprecedented extremely bullish sign. Finally, a breakout above the psychologically important level of $0.00001 could be the last hurdle for a strong move upward. A breakout of this nature could lead to a shift in market sentiment, with the potential to initiate a significant price surge. Related Reading: Shiba Inu L2 Shibarium Crosses 4 Million Transactions As Burn Rate Explodes Notably, the volume does not show an unusual spike yet, which would typically accompany a breakout, suggesting caution. However, the weekly RSI stands at 57.36, indicating the asset is neither overbought nor oversold and potentially allowing room for upward movement if a breakout is confirmed. Short- And Long-Term Shiba Inu Price Targets Looking at the Fibonacci levels, the upcoming key price targets to watch following a successful breakout would be the 0.382 and 0.5 Fibonacci levels, standing at $0.00001051 and $0.00001190, respectively. These levels would be the short-term targets for SHIB, potentially acting as resistance points in the event of an uptrend. In the mid-term, the next crucial price levels are the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $0.00001329, the 0.786 Fibonacci level at $0.00001527 and the August 2022 swing high at $0.00001780. However, traders can also expect notable resistance at $0.000017 which acted as crucial support and resistance in the past. In the long term, the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level at $0.00002509 and the 2.618 Fibonacci extension level at $0.00003690 are some notable price targets. In conclusion, the weekly close firmly holds the market’s attention. If SHIB’s price sustains above the descending trendline, it would mark a significant technical pivot point, likely catalyzing a bullish wave due to the culmination of the quadruple bottom support hold and the descending triangle breakout.

He believes that the crypto token could rise to as high as $200,000 and even provided a timeframe using technical analysis. When Bitcoin Will Hit $200,000 In a post shared on his X platform, Dave the Wave shared an accompanying chart that put Bitcoin’s price at $200,000 on December 1, 2025. Alongside this, he made known the fact that BTC’s moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator seems very bullish. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Rallies To 4-Month Highs – Can Bulls Take It Above $0.3? The crypto analyst went on to give another scenario on how things could play out in terms of this price projection. According to him, Bitcoin hitting $200,000 could be front-run by a year, meaning that it could happen as soon as December 1, 2024. He noted that this could happen when most people are anticipating this price level. Dave the Wave had also earlier predicted that Bitcoin could hit a new all-time high before the year ran out. Based on the chart he shared then, he hinted that the BTC price could hit $69,000 this year. The crypto analyst doesn’t seem to have given up on that happening, as he recently shared an updated chart suggesting that Bitcoin could still hit that price level before 2024. BTC price clears $41,000 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com BTC Price Above $41,000 The flagship cryptocurrency broke above $41,000 to so much excitement from the crypto community. Bitcoin is on a run right now and many believe that it is only up from here on. The reason for this rally has so far been attributed partly to an imminent approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF. Others believe that it is simply because the Bitcoin Halving is around the corner. Related Reading: XRP Price Set To Explode: Analyst Identifies Trigger For Next Parabolic Move Whatever the reason is, what is most obvious is the significant amount of investors trooping into the crypto market right now, with Bitcoin in particular. Two weeks ago, BTC saw inflows totaling US$312m, bringing its year-to-date inflows to just over US$1.5 billion. Liquidity is also flowing into the ecosystem of other tokens like Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Cardano, and BNB. With Bitcoin above $40,000, Dave the Wave seems more optimistic than ever. In one of his most recent X posts, he mentioned that BTC could go “parabolic” if it breaks the upward channel. From the chart he shared, $44,000 seems to be the next stop for the flagship cryptocurrency. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $41,400, up by over 5% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

On Monday, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surged to a peak of $41,800, reflecting a 6% increase . This surge was driven by traders' growing confidence in the Federal Reserve implementing interest rate cuts sooner than initially anticipated. Coinbase ( NASDAQ: COIN ) witnessed an 8% increase , HIVE ( NASDAQ: HIVE ) surged by 11% , and MicroStrategy ( NASDAQ: MSTR ) experienced a positive market sentiment with a 9% rise . RIOT Platforms ( NASDAQ: RIOT ) stood out with an impressive surge of 13% , while CleanSpark ( NASDAQ: CLSK ), Bakkt Holdings ( NYSE: BKKT ), and Marathon Digital ( NASDAQ: MARA ) significantly contributed to the upward trend, each posting growth of more than 15% . Bitfarms ( NASDAQ: BITF ) secured a 9% increase, and Bit Digital ( NASDAQ: BTBT ) saw an 8% rise amid the broader market enthusiasm. After a prolonged wait of 19 months, Bitcoin rally was further fueled by growing optimism surrounding the imminent approval of ETF applications designed to track the top cryptocurrency's price and trade on exchanges. Bloomberg analysts anticipate the Securities and Exchange Commission approving these ETFs as early as January.

42419064,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDVRV,1701685672,UK Lawmakers Urge Lower Digital Pound Holding Limits,"U.K. House of Commons Treasury Committee lawmakers have published their concerns about the government’s plans for a digital pound.  Among other things, they want lower than proposed limits for individual holdings and for the government to create a digital pound that can bear interest.  The U.K. and European Union’s proposals so far have stated that a central bank digital currency, like cash, shouldn’t earn interest.  Lawmakers in the U.K. are asking the government to consider lowering holding limits for a potential digital pound and make sure its design won’t block the possibility of paying interest.  Both the U.K. and its 27-nation neighbor, the European Union, have said in proposals that retail digital currencies should not be allowed to earn interest as bank deposits do.  In a report published Saturday, U.K. legislators in the Treasury Committee of the House of Commons – the lower chamber of Parliament – expressed their concerns about the U.K.’s plans for a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in a February consultation. The government has said a digital pound was “likely needed” in the future.  Countries around the world are looking into CBDCs as a way to improve payments and make central banks embrace digital finance. While the U.S. is still undecided on whether a digital dollar is worth the fuss, all eyes are on Europe, where the U.K. and the European Union (EU) are proposing actual plans for CBDCs for private retail payments.  The EU’s plans for a digital iteration of the euro have taken some heat from the bloc’s lawmakers. While U.K. lawmakers seem to agree with the EU’s proposals for a lower individual holding limit for the digital euro to prevent customer exodus from banks, they don’t seem to agree with blocking CBDCs from earning interest and thereby treating them like cash.  “We recommend that the Bank of England and Treasury undertake further analysis on the monetary policy impact of paying interest on the digital pound, and in the meantime, ensure that their design work does not preclude the possibility of paying interest on the digital pound,” the U.K. legislators said.  The U.K. Treasury’s plans for a digital pound clearly stated that, like cash “and many current accounts, no interest would be paid on a digital pound. This makes it useful for everyday payments but not designed or intended for savings.""  The lawmakers also cautioned against the proposed 10,000- 20,000 British pound ($12,663 - $25,320) holding limit, and instead proposed a lower limit similar to the 3000 euro cap proposed by the EU’s European Central Bank “to reduce the risk of large-scale outflows from bank deposits into digital pounds… with a view to increasing it over time.""  Somewhat matching the skepticism of EU lawmakers, the U.K. Treasury Committee report also said it’s unclear if the benefits of a digital pound outweigh potential risks and warned that digital pound legislation should not allow the government to gather user data from payments “beyond what is permitted by law enforcement.”  “Nevertheless, we support the Bank of England and Treasury undertaking further consultative work on the design of a digital pound to enable it to be launched if benefits increase and risks to privacy and financial stability are mitigated.""  The committee recommended that the government and Bank of England set out in more detail as soon as possible the criteria that will inform its final decision to issue a digital pound.  Seeing as a decision to issue a CBDC is pending, lawmakers also want to hold the government accountable for the costs of studying and designing a digital pound and want the Bank of England and the country’s Treasury to keep track of these expenses.  “To ensure transparency around the costs incurred, we recommend that the Bank of England reports expenditure on the digital pound as a separate line item in its annual report and accounts from 2024 onwards,” the report said.  The U.K. Treasury is expected to drop its response to the consultation on its proposed model for a digital pound soon. This will be followed by an experimentation and design phase before a decision on whether to issue one is made.

The premium has since shrunk to around 7%, with TRX trading at $0.10561 on Binance and $0.11005 on Poloniex, according to exchange data.  An arbitrage trade involves buying an asset on one venue and simultaneously selling it for a higher price on another. Traders take on an element of counterparty risk as they need to ensure capital can eventually flow between both venues.  Poloniex was hacked for more than $114 million last month, an event that prompted the exchange to temporarily freeze deposits and withdrawals.  Tron founder Justin Sun told CoinDesk on Monday that ""TRX withdrawals are open,"" despite the asset trading at a premium on Poloniex.  The trade-off with scooping up cheap TRX on Binance and selling it at a higher price on Poloniex is that certain assets are still locked from being withdrawn. Poloniex said that it has deployed ""a phased approach"" to withdrawals starting with TRX, which will be followed by bitcoin [BTC], ether [ETH] and tether [USDT] over the coming weeks.

Traders consider the two companies as proxy bets for the crypto markets, given their close ties to the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, which has added 4% in the past 24 hours.  Coinbase is one of the largest crypto bourses by trading volumes and is among the few publicly listed crypto companies in the U.S. The firm, which has historically maintained a regulated stance, is listed as a custodian for several proposed bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) products in the country.  The crypto exchange’s Nasdaq-listed shares had added 4.34% to $139.45 as of 11 a.m. ET (16:00 UTC), their highest level since April 2022.  Business software company MicroStrategy is the largest public holder of bitcoin, with 174,000 BTC, a position it acquired over three years by investing company funds and proceeds from bond sales. The value of the holdings is now equal to over 88% of MicroStrategy’s $8.2 billion stock market capitalization.  MSTR traded at $554.17, up around 5%, also a level last seen in April 2022.  Bitcoin has surged recently amid optimism U.S. regulators will approve exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold BTC, a move some experts believe will prompt a flood of investment into the foremost cryptocurrency.

Ethereum currently trading at $2,244.7 territory on the daily chart: TradingView.com The classic sign of a bull market is a sequence of higher lows and higher highs, which is what we observe when we look at Ethereum’s daily chart. The 50-day and 100-day moving averages served as dynamic resistance, but the price has now overcome both. “On the basis of lower yields, cryptocurrency has been going pleasantly higher, along with Gold,” crypto data firm Amberdata stated in a newsletter on Sunday. In a note, Lucy Hu, Senior Analyst at Metalpha, stated that there is increasing market expectation for a rate reduction in the coming year. Investor optimism on the potential for Bitcoin ETF applications from significant asset management firms is also growing. She states: “This is an official declaration of a bull run, and there may be additional price increases in the upcoming weeks.” Meanwhile, laws may also have an impact on Ethereum’s price in the future; although favorable developments may encourage investment, harsher laws may provide risks. Important factors also include investor sentiment and the state of the economy. It’s unclear if ETH will overtake Bitcoin in market valuation; this will depend on things like adoption rates and network improvements.

During the first three quarters of 2023, institutional traders nearly doubled their holdings of bitcoin [BTC]. As of Setpember, half their assets were denominated in the largest cryptocurrency, driven by positive market sentiment and anticipation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. Their stance contrasts with the lower BTC holdings of retail traders, possibly due to their higher leverage levels, Bybit's research shows.  Institutional traders and whales, or large holders of bitcoin, were skeptical about altcoins, the report says, with the data showing a general decline in altcoin holdings among traders despite a brief rise in May. A notable decrease started in August, particularly among institutions, reflecting a cautious stance towards these more volatile assets.  Ether [ETH] holdings have generally declined since the Ethereum blockchain's Shapella upgrade, data shows, except for a surge among institutional traders in September amid a positive crypto outlook as ETF news excited markets.  The bitcoin price is up about 140% year-to-date, while ether has risen 87%.  In a report from October, K33 Research wrote that it was shifting stance on asset allocation, advising a pivot back to bitcoin due to ether's prolonged slump against BTC since July 2022, and a muted response to the newly launched futures-based ETH ETFs.

6849,http://blokt.com/?p=40538,1701676805,Private Internet Access (PIA) VPN Review: [2023],"Today we’ll talk about PIA (Private Internet Access) , a popular VPN that has been in business for almost 20 years. In the interest of full disclosure be aware that this writer used PIA for several years before switching to ExpressVPN in 2018. Private Internet Access (PIA) VPN review for 2023 To help you decide whether PIA is the best VPN for you, we divide this review into several sections. They include: Device Support Speed Security and Privacy Geographic and Legal Considerations Global Coverage Streaming and Torrenting Additional Considerations Customer Support We’ll also fill you in on a surprising side issue that may or may not influence your decision. Shall we begin? Private Internet Access VPN Source: privateinternetaccess.com Device Support PIA offers client applications for the mainstream operating systems. It also provides browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. Private Internet Access for all your devices – Source: www.privateinternetaccess.com PIA has greatly improved its desktop clients since I last used the service. The company has created a consistent, attractive client interface across its desktop clients, although the mobile apps and browser extensions don’t match them right now. Image courtesy of London Trust Media Once you are logged into the client you have access to a wide range of options not normally seen in VPN clients, including a choice of DNS (including one provided by PIA ), encryption type, even a light or dark theme for the client itself. Note : For those who use iOS, we have also compiled a list of the best VPNs for iPhone . Get Private Internet Access Popular Service Private Internet Access VPN Service Get It Speed Discussing the speed of a VPN Service is always tough since it depends on so many factors. Where you connect from, when you do it, and which ISP you use for the tests are just some of those factors. Fortunately, when it comes to PIA, we have some independent test results we can use to answer the speed question. In 2018, one of PIA’s competitors commissioned a company called AV-TEST GmbH to do some independent testing. It ran a large set of tests on a dozen VPN Services, including PIA . Speed Performance (PIA) – Source: Shutterstock.com The VPN Comparative Test report showed PIA to have better latency ( ping ), streaming, upload, and download speeds than most of the VPNs tested. Given this, it was surprising that PIA was one of the slowest VPNs among those tested. These results imply that under most circumstances, PIA will be fast enough for most users. To find out if it will be fast enough for you, we recommend that you take advantage of its 7-day money-back guarantee to run some speed tests using your devices and your ISP in the locations where you are most likely to be using the VPN. Then compare your test results with the data in this April 5, 2019, Consumer Reports article discussing the download speeds needed to stream different types of multimedia content. A few rounds of testing in typical situations where you would use PIA should give you enough information to decide if this VPN is fast enough for you. Security and Privacy Now we need to talk about security and privacy. While related, they are not the same thing. The differences become particularly important when talking about PIA since it is based in the United States . Security and Privacy(PIA) – Source: Shutterstock.com By the time you finish this section of the article, you will have a good sense of how security and privacy differ, and how the two play out with PIA . Go to PIA PIA Security Security means being able to keep others from messing with your stuff. Locking the doors of your house provides security for you and everything else in the house. Putting money in a vault provides security for your money. VPN security is provided by two technologies: tunneling and encryption . Tunneling Tunneling involves taking each data packet that moves between your computer and the VPN and putting that data packet inside another data packet. This “outer” data packet has a standard format that is used by the VPN. The original packet is hidden inside the VPN formatted data packet. To an outside observer, it simply looks like standardized data packets are passing back and forth between your computer and the VPN . Tunneling(PIA) – Source: Shutterstock.com Putting your data packets inside standardized VPN data packets is called encapsulation. The VPN software on your computer and the software in the VPN server both can encapsulate packets into VPN formatted packets and extract them again. Once extracted, these packets function the same way they would have if there was no VPN involved at all. OpenVPN is widely-respected, open source software that handles encapsulation as well as encryption for the best VPN services. Encryption Encapsulation provides one layer of protection for the messages flowing between your computer and the VPN. But someone with the right software who can intercept the VPN packets flowing back and forth can extract the original data packets. To deal with this problem, VPNs use encryption. Before encapsulating message packets for tunneling, the VPN software on your computer or in the server encrypts the message packets. In theory, only your computer and the VPN can read packets that are encrypted. Encryption(PIA) – Source: Shutterstock.com VPNs employ various encryption techniques. Some are now obsolete in that computers have become powerful enough to quickly crack their encryption. Others are too hard to crack but have weaknesses built into them called backdoors that allow anyone who knows how to use the backdoor to easily decrypt the messages. And others are, as far as we know, uncrackable within any reasonable amount of time and free of backdoors. PIA supports several of the most popular encryption techniques, including AES-256 . This encryption standard is considered “military-grade” as it is used in the most secure military and commercial applications. Go to PIA IP Address Leaks Your IP Address can be used to identify your specific computer or mobile device, making it relatively easy to identify you. You want to be sure that your VPN never exposes that information on the Internet. Without going into too much detail, there are three types of leaks: IP leaks , DNS leaks, and WebRTC leaks . Testing shows that PIA prevents all three of these types of leaks. Another situation that could cause your IP Address to leak is if your connection to the VPN fails for some reason. Typically if the VPN connection fails, your computer will revert to its normal connection to the Internet. That exposes your IP Address to anyone who happens to be looking. IP Address Leaks(PIA) – Source: Shutterstock.com To deal with this problem, the best VPNs include a Kill Switch. The Kill Switch is software that automatically disconnects your computer from the Internet if the VPN fails. PIA comes with a built-in Kill Switch. However, the Kill Switch is not enabled by default. You must enable it manually. There was a bit of controversy about the PIA Kill Switch in 2018 , with some users reporting that the switch failed to reliably disconnect their computer from the Internet under certain circumstances. We haven’t seen any recent complaints about this issue, but if the Kill Switch is important to you, we suggest you contact PIA Support and ask about this before licensing the product. PIA DNS Like industry leader ExpressVPN , PIA provides its own DNS service . Many VPNs encrypt messages passing through their network but use third-party DNS servers to resolve IP Addresses. PIA sets the DNS Server addresses in your operating system to point to its private DNS servers. Directing all DNS requests through the VPN to private PIA DNS servers prevents your IP Address from being exposed as a DNS leak. PIA Privacy Policy & Confirmation of No-Logs Status PIA is a “no-logs” VPN. That means it records no data that could be used to track your activities online or associate you with specific activities. Illustrating how serious it is about this, PIA posted this video by Rick Falvinge. Rick Falvinge founded the Swedish Pirate Party in 2006. Today he is the Head of Privacy at Private Internet Access. In the following video, he explains that PIA does not log and what it would do if the US Government (or anyone else) tried to force it to keep logs. Rick is a prominent member of the bitcoin cash community and is a very ideologically driven individual and very anti-government. Having someone like that to head your privacy is a very good sign that things are working correctly. And PIA’s dedication to the privacy of its users isn’t just talk. It has been demonstrated in two court cases. First, in a 2016 FBI case dealing with a fake bomb threat , and again in a 2018 FBI hacking case , PIA was unable to provide the FBI the information they desired. In both cases, PIA simply did not have the data because it doesn’t keep logs of user activity. It only records the email address you use to sign up for its service. Geographic and Legal Considerations So far, PIA is looking like a very fine VPN service. It is in this section of the article that things get a little muddier. Legal Jurisdiction Since VPNs exist to provide online privacy and security, where they are located can make a big difference. Different countries have different laws about privacy, Internet use, encryption, censorship and so on. For example, some countries require all online services, including VPNs, to keep detailed records of where the users go online and what they do. These records must be made available to local law enforcement or government officials as required by local laws. Legal Jurisdiction – Source: Shutterstock.com Other countries are heavy into censorship, demanding that online services (possibly including local VPNs) block users from visiting sites that the local bureaucrats dislike. The United States takes a different approach. The government doesn’t censor sites. Instead, private businesses like Google and Facebook censor content under pressure from politicians and activist groups. The USA also doesn’t require VPNs based in the USA to record everything users do online. Instead, law enforcement and intelligence agencies can force online services, including VPNs, to secretly record data about specific individuals using their services. What does all this have to do with PIA ? London Trust Media, Inc., the parent company of PIA, is based in Denver, CO. That means that it is under US jurisdiction, and could be subjected to pressure from law enforcement and intelligence agencies to secretly record data about you. London Trust Media, Inc. – Source: londontrustmedia.com Normally servers that are located in other countries are governed by those laws, rather than the laws of the country where the company is based. However, in past disputes, the United States has tried to force companies to comply with US laws even for resources (like VPN servers) that are located outside US territory. While we urge you to avoid doing anything illegal online, and it is highly unlikely that anyone reading this will be targeted for individual attention by the FBI or NSA, there are other high-quality VPNs that are based in more privacy-friendly jurisdictions. The Mt. Gox / PIA Connection If you are into cryptocurrencies you have probably heard of Mt. Gox. This was an early Bitcoin exchange based in Japan . It ended up declaring bankruptcy in 2014 after a lawsuit, seizures of cash by the US Department of Homeland Security, technical problems preventing users from withdrawing money , charges of stolen Bitcoins , amongst other problems. The Mt. Gox / PIA Connection – Source: Shutterstock.com Mt. Gox creditors claimed to have lost over 2 trillion dollars during this mess. The CEO of Mt. Gox was arrested in August 2015 and charged with several offenses including embezzlement and fraud. On March 14, 2019, the Tokyo District Court found the former CEO guilty of falsifying data but acquitted him of embezzlement and other charges. He is currently free of jail on a 4-year suspended sentence. Note: For much more detail on the Mt. Gox case, visit this Wikipedia page . What does the Mt. Gox situation have to do with PIA ? Mark Karpelès is the former CEO of Mt. Gox. He was hired as the CTO of London Trust Media, the parent company of PIA, in April of 2018. His hiring raised doubts about continuing with PIA among some users. The fact that Mr. Karpelès was recently acquitted of most charges is a good sign, although the following passage from a Bloomberg story about his recent court appearance isn’t comforting: “The former Mt. Gox chief executive officer sometimes mixed his personal finances with those of the exchange and fiddled with its accounts, apparently to hide the fact that the platform had lost money to hackers, the Tokyo District Court said on Friday. The court cleared Karpeles of embezzlement charges, concluding that the 33-year-old Frenchman had acted without ill intent.” Mr. Mark Karpelès , Bloomberg.com Physical Distance Messages take a finite amount of time to traverse the connections on the Internet-based on how far they must go. Connecting to a VPN almost always makes messages travel further. But you can minimize this problem by choosing to connect to a VPN server close to your physical location, or physically close to the Internet resource you want to use. PIA has servers in 32 countries. This gives you a reasonably good chance of connecting to a VPN server that is physically close. You might want to check out the PIA Network page to see if it has servers where you need them. Go to PIA Global Coverage As you can see in the screenshot below, as of April 23, 2019, PIA had over 3,300 servers in 52 locations spread across 32 countries. Global Coverage-PIA The PIA network has a good number of servers, but they are located in fewer countries than some of its major competitors like NordVPN and ExpressVPN . Still, unless you need to reach some of the less-popular services in the world, it should suffice. If you want to access a streaming service that only accepts users from a country that is not listed above, you might want to reconsider. There are plenty of other VPN providers who have a better spread of servers in many locations across the world. If you are looking for a list of our top recommendations see our best VPN guide. Streaming and Torrenting For many people, the number one use of a VPN is for streaming multimedia content and/or torrenting (downloading content). In this section, we’ll look into how well PIA serves this audience. We currently rank it number 4 on our best VPNs for torrenting list. Streaming and Torrenting(PIA) – Source: Shutterstock.com Streaming and Torrenting Speed PIA servers are generally fast enough for streaming and torrenting without a lot of annoying drops or delays. And like industry leader ExpressVPN , it also provides a SOCKS5 proxy server that gives you a faster connection. But you have to be careful. Why? We’ll cover that in the next sections. Security While Streaming Most streaming media companies often have contractual and legal requirements to control where in the world their content is available. For example, Netflix has one library of content for the USA , another for the UK , and so on. They use a technique called geo-blocking to prevent people from accessing the “wrong” library. This setup means that you may not be able to access the content you pay for simply because you happen to be in another location when you try to connect. Geo-blocking systems check the IP Address you are using to decide if you are allowed to view the content you are trying to get. You can use a VPN or a proxy to get around this problem. By connecting to the service using a VPN server that is located in an “approved” location, you may be able to evade the geo-blocking system. Security While Streaming(PIA) – Source: Shutterstock.com Standard proxy servers provide the same kind of location-shifting ability as a VPN, but without the encryption. A SOCKS5 proxy server like that provided by PIA provides more protection than a regular proxy server, but less than a VPN. In other words, you have a tradeoff to make : Step 1: You can use the full PIA VPN service when you want to stream content. This is the most secure way to go, but the strong encryption this gives you means you will have a slower connection. Step 2: You can use the SOCKS5 proxy when you want to stream content. This is faster but less secure than using the full PIA VPN. You will need to decide what makes the most sense for you in any given situation. One factor to consider is the acceptability/legality of streaming content. If a streaming service figures out that it is you who is trying to get around its geo-blocking , it may ban you. In some countries, it is actually illegal to stream content by getting around the geo-blocks . What about Netflix? Netflix puts a lot of effort into ensuring that its content only gets streamed where it wants it to be. It uses tools like databases of the IP Addresses of known VPNs to try to prevent anyone from getting around its geo-blocking. And Netflix is good at it. PIA has had some success at getting around these blocks, but this is an ongoing battle, and there are no guarantees. About Netflix(PIA) – Source: Shutterstock.com We haven’t seen any results showing that the SOCKS5 proxy is better than the full PIA VPN for connecting to Netflix or vice versa. If connecting to Netflix is very important to you, you may want to consider ExpressVPN or NordVPN , both of which have good reputations as VPNs for Netflix. Go to PIA Security While Torrenting Being secure while torrenting is an important issue. That’s because, in many, if not most countries, torrenting is illegal . The USA , for example, has the DMCA (Digital Millennium Content Act). Under the DMCA, downloading a copyrighted movie, or even a single 3-minute song can result in up to 5 years in prison and a fine of up to $150,000 per file. Whether or not you consider these penalties wildly out of line with the severity of the “crime,” this is the law. Security While Torrenting(PIA) – Source: Shutterstock.com This law does not just apply to commercial pirates. Here are some cases where these massive penalties have been applied: A college student fined $675,000 for downloading 30 songs. A single mom by the name of Jammie Thomas-Rasset , who was fined over a million dollars for downloading 24 songs. Several other countries have similarly brutal copyright laws. Obviously, the best way to avoid this kind of life-destroying risk is to not download copyrighted content. But if you are one of the tens of millions of people worldwide who intends to torrent multimedia content in spite of such laws, a VPN can provide some protection. Services like PIA hide your IP Address when you are torrenting and don’t keep logs that would allow the authorities to identify you. The question is what happens if your connection to the VPN fails . With some services, your computer simply reverts to communicating without protection, exposing your IP Address to the world. The better VPNs all implement something called a Kill Switch . This is a system that disconnects your computer from the Internet if the connection to the VPN fails . PIA includes a Kill Switch that you must enable manually. We strongly recommend that you turn this on and leave it on. Note that as recently as May of 2018 , there were online complaints that the PIA Kill Switch was not reliable and sometimes exposed a user’s IP Address when it should not have. But we haven’t seen any such complaints since then, implying that PIA has fixed the problem. Additional Considerations Here are additional considerations to take into account when looking at PIA . Additional Considerations(PIA) – Source: Shutterstock.com Connections This is one area where PIA shines . It allows 10 simultaneous connections to its service. That is, you can have 10 devices of whatever type actively using the VPN service at once. This is impressively generous. Most services offer between 3 and 6 simultaneous connections. Connections(PIA) – Source: Shutterstock.com Now it is hard to imagine most people needing more than 10 simultaneous connections, but what can you do if you do need more? PIA can be installed on a router, which means that every device connected to that router automatically gets connected to the PIA VPN network. PIA gives you a couple of ways to set this up: Step 1: You can buy a router that comes with PIA already installed and configured. You can get routers with PIA pre-installed on them from several manufacturers. More information on this option is available under the Plug n’ Play Router Setup heading. Step 2: You can install PIA on your current router. This takes some technical chops , and not every router is supported. To find out which routers are supported, check the Advanced Router Setup heading. Price By this point, you are probably wondering what it would cost you to sign up for PIA. Unlike some of its competitors, PIA makes things simple. Every payment option includes the full-service offering. The only difference is that the price varies depending on the length of the subscription you sign up for. Here are the prices listed at the end of March 2020: Price (PIA) – Source: privateinternetaccess.com Length of Plan Price Total Price Billed Up Front 1-month $9.95 per month $9.95 1-year $5.99 per month (billed once per year) $71.88 2-year $3.49 per month (billed once every 2 years) $83.87 A month-by-month subscription to PIA is about $10 per month, which is pretty typical. As you might expect, if you sign up for a longer-term subscription the monthly price drops. The $3.49 per month price for a 2-year subscription is good, putting PIA in the ranks of less-expensive services. PIA offers a 7-day money-back guarantee in lieu of a free trial. This is okay, but it would be nice if it gave a longer trial period. PIA is creative with its payment methods. It supports all the usual credit cards, PayPal , and a range of cryptocurrencies, as shown here: PIA is creative with their payment methods Beyond this, PIA supports its own gift cards and even allows you to trade in gift cards from various stores to pay for your subscription: Gift cards from various stores to pay for your subscription Customer Support Customer Service was a weak point with PIA when this writer was a subscriber. However, in the last year or so the company has made major strides in this area. As PIA themselves said in 2017: “…we’re putting our money where our mouths are by increasing our customer service budget to better serve you. Additionally, we’ve increased the qualifications required for our customer support agents. We are implementing more stringent and routine quality assessments of our support agents. Support agents that fall below a certain satisfaction rating, as reported by our customers, will be re-trained in hopes to meet our high quality standards. Should improvement not be realized, we will replace team members on an as needed basis.” Customer Service Department , Private Internet Access Customer Support – Source: www.privateinternetaccess.com It seems that this increased emphasis has paid off for the company. These days there are few complaints about PIA’s support visible online. Conclusion PIA is a VPN service that has some strong points and some disappointing negatives. If you need a lot of simultaneous connections at a low price and don’t mind a USA-based service, you should definitely check it out. But if you live in the United States or don’t need lots of connections at a low price, there are other options that would probably serve you better.

42419071,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDVVd,1701673782,"Bitcoin Market-Neutral Bets Offer 10% Return as BTC Tops $41K, Analysts Say","The market-neutral bitcoin ""basis"" trade offers an annualized double-digit return as futures premium rise above 10%.  The strategy could become more attractive with the launch of spot ETFs next year, one analyst said.  Bitcoin [BTC], the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has surged past $41,000 for the first time since April 2022.  While the rally is undoubtedly good news for directional traders, market-neutral traders who intend to make steady returns irrespective of price trends need not feel left behind, as return on such strategies is steadily climbing.  The bitcoin cash and carry arbitrage or the so-called basis trade, a market-neutral strategy seeking to profit from mispricings in the spot and futures market, now offers at least 10% annualized return, data from crypto derivatives exchange Deribit show. The basis is the difference between prices for futures and the spot price of the underlying asset.  The strategy involves taking a long position in the spot market and simultaneously selling futures when futures are trading at a premium to the spot price. Setting opposing positions helps traders collect a fixed return as the premium evaporates over time and converges with the spot price on the futures contract’s expiry date, irrespective of the spot market trend.  Front-month, three-month and longer-dated futures contracts listed on Deribit traded at an annualized premium of 8% to 12% at press time. In other words, a trader setting a cash and carry strategy today can expect an 8% to 12% return (excluding trading costs) from the mispricing in the two markets.  “The cash-carry basis trade, a standout in the 2020/2021 bull market, is hinting at a resurgence. Currently, the futures basis is hovering near YTD highs, around 10%,” crypto quant researcher Samneet Chepal told CoinDesk.  The basis trade now offers a notably higher return compared to the so-called risk-free rate of 4.2% offered by the U.S. 10-year Treasury note. That said, the spread between yields on the basis trade and the 10-year note is nowhere close to what we saw in early 2021 when three-month BTC futures traded at a premium of 40% and the 10-year note yielded around 1.5%. But things could improve, assuming BTC extends the recent bull run.  ""This could be just the beginning. With ETF news expected in early Q1 next year, we might see these numbers climb even higher, potentially surpassing previous cycle highs,"" Chepal added.  All else being equal, futures contracts typically trade at a premium to the spot price, and the premium widens during bull runs. Bitcoin has risen 54% since Oct. 1, for several reasons, including the expected launch of one or more spot-based exchange-traded funds in the U.S.  Deribit attributes this surge to a confluence of factors, including widespread optimism in anticipation of the pending ETF decision, easing concerns following the settlement of Binance’s legal matters, escalating geopolitical tensions, and the steady increase in institutional engagement, the exchange’s Chief Commercial Officer Luuk Strijers told CoinDesk.  “Another supporting sign is the futures basis rising beyond 10%, a strong indicator of current market sentiment,” Strijers said.",POSITIVE,없음,BCH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/04/bitcoin-market-neutral-bets-offer-10-return-as-btc-tops-41k-analysts-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c34d17e5621eb0bae72f096a7886ce819f4b131c-1699x1139.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

21032941,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=563705,1701673237,"Bitcoin Price Blasts Past $41,500: Here Are The Reasons","In a remarkable surge, Bitcoin’s price has soared past the $41,500 mark, fueled by a confluence of factors ranging from market anticipation of a Bitcoin spot ETF to broader financial trends. Here’s a detailed analysis of the key reasons behind this rally: #1 Spot Bitcoin ETF: The Anticipation Game The buzz around the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF remains probably the most significant driver of the recent price surge. Although there hasn’t been a specific update, the market anticipation is palpable, with a FOMO effect kicking in. Last week, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart suggested that a spot ETF is likely to be approved between January 8 and 10, causing the market to react. Renowned Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo mirrored the anticipation with this statement, “It’s very likely we are on the eve of a Bitcoin spot ETF. The first commodity ETF was SPDR Gold Trust. It provided a simple way for investors to access gold in their portfolio. When it launched gold went on to an 8 year rally with no single down year between 2005 – 2012.” #2 Gold’s Meteoric Rise And Its Correlation With BTC The unexpected rise of gold, surging by 3.5% in just 30 minutes to a new all-time high on a Sunday afternoon, may have also had repercussions for Bitcoin. This rapid ascent in gold’s value could signal more than just market fluctuations; it could reflect deeper economic shifts that have direct implications for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Over 80% Of Bitcoin Holders Now In Profit – Report Crypto Analyst @TheFlowHorse remarked, “Unless someone is getting carried out right now after shorting Gold, this is saying something important. Gold doesn’t just arbitrarily rip on a Sunday like this unless it means something.” Tom Crown, founder and CEO of Crown Analysis, added, “Something VERY BIG is coming tomorrow. Gold just BLASTED past all-time highs on a Sunday night. Someone knows something.” #3 Bitcoin Short Squeeze The liquidation of $65.15 million in Bitcoin short positions, according Coinglass data, has further propelled Bitcoin’s price. The short squeeze, combined with strong spot demand, has been a key factor. Crypto analyst Skew noted, “Another big short squeeze pushing price above $40K. Slight perp premium on Binance during the squeeze, indicating spot selling into the short squeeze.” #4 Whales And Institutional Buyers The current surge in Bitcoin’s price has been significantly influenced by whales and institutional buyers. Market analyst Skew pointed out their impact, stating, “Someone is still aggressively chasing price here. More importantly if said large market entity actually allows some bids to get filled or not. IF filled then expected for them to push the price higher. Clearly $40K is the price for institutional players.” Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Bullish Surge Ahead: Deribit Predicts Major Price Leap In Early 2024 Keith Alan, co-founder of Material Indicators, further emphasized the role of these large holders, tweeting, “Bitcoin Whales just blasted through $40k.” His statement underlines the significant influence whales have in driving up Bitcoin’s price. He added, “Locking in some profit here. $42k is a high probability, but definitely not guaranteed.” Additionally, GreeksLive, a trading tools provider, noted the broader market trend, stating, “Bitcoin broke through $41,000, Ethereum broke through $2,200… The giant whale once again showed a sense of smell before the market.” December saw a rise beyond expectations, bitcoin broke through $41,000, ethereum broke through $2,200, and continued to rise almost without retracement.The giant whale once again showed a sense of smell before the market, from last week to re-add positions in the block call,… https://t.co/EO6MddoNXX pic.twitter.com/ekD4LiLExs — Greeks.live (@GreeksLive) December 4, 2023 #5 Liquidity: The Underlying Force The surge in Bitcoin’s price is also significantly influenced by global liquidity conditions, a factor often overlooked but crucial in understanding BTC and cryptocurrency market dynamics. Zerohedge highlighted the scale of this influence in a post: “In November, central banks added $350BN in liquidity, the third-largest increase since March.” This massive injection of liquidity by central banks around the world plays a pivotal role in asset price movements, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. David Marlin, CEO of Marlin Capital, pointed out the significance of this trend in financial conditions, “US Financial Conditions eased 90 bps in November, the largest monthly easing on record (dating back to 1982).” Adding to this narrative, cryptocurrency expert Charles Edwards commented on the historic nature of this easing, saying, “November saw the largest easing in over 40 years!” Such a significant easing of financial conditions suggests a highly conducive environment for investment in assets like Bitcoin, which are seen as hedges against inflation and currency devaluation. Arthur Hayes, founder of BitMEX, summed up the sentiment by stating, “Eye on the prize. RRP balances continue to fall and BTC continues to pump. Yachtzee!!!” At press time, BTC traded at $41,505.

6844,http://blokt.com/?p=50808,1701673203,Best VPNs For Google Chrome [2023],"Chances are, you’re reading this from the world’s most popular web browser, Google Chrome. According to StatCounter, almost 65% of internet users access the web through Chrome or a Chromium-based browser. Chromium open-source software also powers new arrivals to the browser scene, such as Brave, which means that all the VPN extensions we’ll be looking at here are also compatible with any other Chromium based browsers. This guide is also going to be relevant to Google Chromebook users – but with one important distinction. If you’re a Chromebook user, all of the browser extensions below will only encrypt your internet traffic while you’re inside a Chrome browser session. You’ll need to download the Android client for each of these VPN’s to use it on your Chromebook. Why do you need a VPN extension for Chrome? You might think that having a VPN application installed and running from your desktop will give you complete privacy – but you’d be wrong. Although VPN applications reroute your traffic through a private server and mask your IP, there are still certain ways that you can be tracked through your browser session. To show you local recommendations and services, many websites will track your session through HTML5 geolocation , which reveals your approximate location – with greater accuracy if you’re using a GPS enabled device. It’s a little-known way that websites can see your approximate location without tracking your IP, and it’s especially annoying if you’re making an effort not to be served ads, or get tracked as you navigate the web. Most quality VPN extensions for Chrome will spoof your location, which prevents HTML5 geolocation from establishing your location. Traditional location tracking through your IP will use ‘web real-time communication’, or WebRTC, to track you during your session. Most VPNs will block this even through their desktop apps, but you can ensure your session is private through a browser extension. Often, VPN providers will refer to their Chrome extensions as ‘proxy extensions’, because of the extra security they afford their users. Here, we’re going to look at the best VPNs for both the Google Chrome browser, and the Google Chromebook . ExpressVPN ExpressVPN is a service we’ve reviewed extensively in the past, and it’s always been one of our favorite services. Sign up to ExpressVPN Established in 2009, ExpressVPN has been providing military-grade traffic encryption and privacy protection for over a decade, and in May 2019 they launched the latest iteration of their Chrome extension. One of the highest-rated VPN browser extensions on the market, the ExpressVPN Chrome extension offers serious browsing protection for users of all levels. The extension was last updated in March 2020. To install the ExpressVPN Chrome browser extension, you’ll first need to have the desktop app (full client) for Windows, Mac, Android (and also Chromebook), or Linux, and an active ExpressVPN subscription. You can sign up here. The ExpressVPN app for Chrome has a 4.2 star rating from over 650 users, and 800,000 downloads. Users can also download an Android client for ExpressVPN to protect their Chromebook. ExpressVPN for Chrome features ExpressVPN’s Chrome extension provides extra options for privacy protection. There’s a lot of crossover between the ExpressVPN desktop app and their Chrome extension, however there’s a few extra features to keep you safe while browsing, which include: Location spoofing – Prevents HTML5 geolocation code embedded in websites from revealing your true whereabouts. One-click connection – Once you’ve installed the extension, you can turn it off or on in seconds using the icon in the top right corner of your browser. You’ll automatically connect to the last place you connected to on your desktop app. WebRTC blocking – ExpressVPN ensures your location is obfuscated through changing your IP address. HTTPS upgrade – If you connect to a site which doesn’t have HTTPS protection, the ExpressVPN extension will automatically connect you to a more secure version of the site, which helps to protect your personal data. Once you’ve downloaded and installed the extension, it’s added to your Chrome toolbar (in the top right corner next to your user profile by default), and you can open the extension to change settings like server location, HTTPS settings, and more. Is ExpressVPN reliable? As one of the best-established and most trusted VPN services, ExpressVPN has gained a good reputation for providing reliable and safe internet privacy. Over the years, they’ve built a huge network of dedicated servers and infrastructure to provide a stable service to users, which includes: Unlimited bandwidth – Some smaller VPN operators place restrictions on bandwidth, but with ExpressVPN’s network of over 3,000 servers across 94 countries, you can enjoy unlimited use of your VPN. Streaming services – ExpressVPN works hard to keep support open for streaming services, like Netflix and Amazon Prime, allowing users to bypass geo-restrictions. Anonymous browsing – Together with their HTML5 and WebRTC blocking, ExpressVPN uses TrustedServer technology to encrypt browsing data as you surf Chrome. Multi-device support – Whether you’re browsing Chrome from a Windows, Android , Iphone , Mac , or Linux device, you can install ExpressVPN. Chrome extensions are only available to desktop users. Chromebook users are supported via the Android client. Does ExpressVPN support streaming services? ExpressVPN does provide guarantees that it’s users will be able to bypass most major streaming services, for instance if they’re trying to watch American Netflix from Europe. This is known as bypassing ‘georestrictions’, and whilst some VPNs provide this dedicated service, many do not. ExpressVPN is well known for its support of geo-restriction bypassing on all devices, including inside the Chrome browser and Chromebook, and they also offer a 30-day money back guarantee if the service happens not to work for you. How much does ExpressVPN cost? As we mentioned, you’ll need a subscription and the desktop app to use the ExpressVPN browser extension. To download the ExpressVPN client to your desktop, you’ll also need to first have an active subscription, so make sure you’ve visited ExpressVPN’s website and signed-up before you try to add their Chrome extension, because it won’t work otherwise. ExpressVPN is one of the more expensive VPN providers, but we think their reputation, security, and customer service makes up for this somewhat. Subscription costs $12.95 per month billed on a month-by-month basis, reduced to $8.32 per month if you subscribe and pay up front for a year’s service. This will set you back $99.95 in a lump sum, but it’s equivalent to savings of over $55 – which makes the service more affordable. You can pay for ExpressVPN with Bitcoin . Contract Length Monthly Price Monthly $12.95 Yearly $8.32 ExpressVPN Chrome extension verdict Since their update in May 2019, ExpressVPN’s Chrome extension is one of the most downloaded browser extensions of any VPN provider, trusted by almost a million users. Their high rating on the Chrome web store is a good indication of how well the extension performs. We particularly like how easy it is to install and connect to the service. If you’re an ExpressVPN desktop user, it takes literally seconds to install and use the extension – and we really recommend you do. It’s not intrusive either, there’s no annoying notifications or pop-ups while you’re browsing – it simply sits on the toolbar and does its job. Overall, ExpressVPN is a great choice for both Chromebook and Chrome browser users who want an extra layer of protection. Sign up to ExpressVPN NordVPN NordVPN’s Chrome extension isn’t intrusive and provides multiple servers. Another of our regularly featured VPN providers, we’ve previously highly recommended NordVPN for both it’s affordable subscription prices, and consistently reliable service. One of the VPN industries biggest names, NordVPN launched in 2012 out of Panama, and has grown into a behemoth of the VPN space – serving over 12 million users worldwide. Their Chrome extension, first launched in 2017, is a great way to ensure NordVPN’s privacy extension extends to every part of your browsing experience. Downloaded by half a million users, the extension generally has good reviews, with a three-star rating overall. It’s worth mentioning here that NordVPN also has an incredibly useful password manager Chrome extension called NordPass. This is a fairly new service by NordVPN and it offers a single secure place to store passwords and login information. All passwords are encrypted using XChaCha20 – the latest encryption technology. NordVPN’s Chrome extension was recently updated in December 2019, and the team publishes regular updates to the service. Sign up to Nordvpn NordVPN for Chrome features We’ll take a look at some of NordVPNs wider VPN features below, but there’s several unique services included in their Chrome extension which makes it well worth considering: HTTP encryption – All traffic moving through the NordVPN Chrome extension is encrypted using the Transport Layer Security protocol (TLS 1.2), which provides an extra layer of privacy to your web inputs and activity. WebRTC leak protection – Like ExpressVPN, NordVPN’s browser extension prevents WebRTC leaks while you’re inside a browser session, which could reveal your true location even while your desktop VPN application is running. Malware protection – A unique feature we love about NordVPN is their ‘CyberSec’ protection, which actively protects users from intrusive auto-play adverts, pop-ups, and unauthorized downloads while you’re browsing the web. Unique IP’s – It’s well-known that NordVPN has one of the largest ranges of servers of any VPN service, but they also provide access to over 1,100 unique IP addresses in over 60 countries that users can connect to through their Chrome extension. Ranked Num 1 – Ranked our num 1 best VPN overall, as well as the best for torrenting , gaming and much more. Is NordVPN reliable? As one of the most used VPN providers in the world, NordVPN is generally trusted for its reliability and safety. We actually rank NordVPN as the number one VPN in our best VPN guide for 2020. We also have a very detailed 2000+ word Nordvpn review that is worth reading. We previously found that NordVPN consistently ranks near the top, or in leading position, for virtually every category in VPN performance, but here’s a few overall features which make NordVPN a great choice: Special servers – NordVPN have developed a number of special servers which offer added browsing protection, including ‘Onion over VPN’, double VPN connection, and more. These features aren’t available via the Chrome extension, but you can still connect through your desktop app while receiving added security from your extension. Streaming – Slow streaming over VPN is a thing of the past with NordVPN, who use their thousands of servers to provide fast and reliable access to streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu, with unlimited bandwidth and bypassing geo-restrictions. No-log policy – User data, browsing history, and access information are never stored by NordVPN, and they don’t comply with requests for this data. Their no-logs policy is independently verified by third-party auditors. Does NordVPN support streaming services? If you’re watching Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, or any other major streaming service through your Chrome browser, you’ll be pleased to know that you can use NordVPN to bypass geo-location restrictions. The NordVPN team works hard to keep these services available, and their huge network of servers let’s most users slip past restrictions every time. If you’re just watching shows in your Chrome browser, then the NordVPN extension may be all you need to manage your VPN connection – without launching the full client. How much does NordVPN cost? Like most other providers, it’s cheaper to sign-up to NordVPN with a longer subscription than paying monthly – and NordVPN offers some of the largest savings for long-term subscribers of any provider. NordVPN offers a few different pricing plans. From least to most expensive, these are Standard, Plus, and Complete. Each plan provides more features as they get more expensive. For a two year complete subscription, users pay just $134.73 in one lump sum. This may sound like a lot, but this equates to just $5.61 per month – a saving of over $200 compared to paying a monthly subscription at $14.99 per month. That’s three years protection for less than one year’s subscription when paid monthly. This hugely affordable price has definitely contributed to NordVPNs success, and it’s proof that you can get a professional product at good prices. Once you’ve subscribed, you can download the Android client if you’re using a Google Chromebook, then install the Chrome extension – you’ll be logged in automatically, and connected to your last used VPN server. Contract Length Monthly Price Monthly $14.99 Yearly $4.05 Two Years $5.61 NordVPN Chrome extension verdict Sign up to Nordvpn Design wise, the NordVPN Chrome extension is very user friendly, easy to install and use, and doesn’t obstruct your browsing experience. The NordVPN icon sits in your browser’s toolbar, displaying a small green block of text showing the country you’re connected to – a useful feature if you regularly access services in different jurisdictions. CyberSec protection is a really interesting feature by NordVPN , and their inclusion of it in their Chrome extension provides yet another layer of protection against all sorts of malware and attacks, pop-ups, and auto-play adverts. As a result the NordVPN Chrome extension is one of the few VPN extensions that doubles up as a basic ad-blocker and anti-tracker in one, making your browsing experience more pleasant. It does have a lower score on the Chrome web store than ExpressVPN , but we found the functionality quite similar and just as good overall. If you’re looking for an affordable Chromebook VPN with plenty of features, and a well designed browser extension, then NordVPN is a great choice. TunnelBear The only VPN which promises to ‘put a bear in your browser’, TunnelBear is a Canadian VPN provider, owned by cyber-security firm McAfee. The service claims to have 20 million users – more than other leading brands NordVPN and ExpressVPN. There are full Android clients available for Chromebook users, and the Google Chrome extension takes just a few seconds to download. TunnelBear really started coming into their own following their acquisition by McAfee in 2018, but their Chrome extension is already one of the most downloaded on the web store, and has incredible reviews from its users. Of 700,000 users, there are almost 33,000 reviews of the TunnelBear Chrome extension, with an amazing 5-star rating – the highest on our list. The last update of their extension was released in October 2019. Compare this to just the few hundred reviews by users of NordVPN and ExpressVPN, and it’s easy to see that TunnelBear must have something worth shouting about. Let’s find out what it is! TunnelBear for Chrome features TunnelBear puts a bear in your browser! Remember, when you’re using the Chrome extension for TunnelBear , you’re only protected whilst you’re inside that browsing session. We strongly recommend downloading the Android full client to protect your entire traffic. That said, TunnelBear has built a robust VPN Chrome extension which works well as stand-alone protection for lightweight tasks like browsing the web on the go. These include: Tracking protection – If you simply want a VPN service to stop annoying ads being served that track your whereabouts, then the TunnelBear extension works great. It blocks your IP by tunneling through their VPN servers. Avoid regional blocking – If a website is blocked to users from your jurisdiction, the TunnelBear Chrome extension is a really easy way to bypass these restrictions. You can do this without downloading the full client for your device. Public WiFi protection – Connecting to public WiFi without VPN protection is dangerous. It’s easy for attackers to gain access to your device, and lift personal information about your browsing session – such as payment info. If you only use public WiFi occasionally, then TunnelBear’s Chrome extension is an easy way to get basic protection. TunnelBear Blocker The TunnelBear Blocker stops trackers and ads. The TunnelBear Blocker is a standalone extension for Chrome, but it works alongside their VPN service really well. The extension blocks all ads like a traditional ad-blocker, but it also prevents email tracking, browser fingerprinting, and more. Users can also use the TunnelBear Blocker to prevent Adobe Flash applications from running automatically within Chrome, as well as prevent third-party tracking as you navigate between sites. If you’re thinking of installing the TunnelBear VPN extension, we also recommend you use the TunnelBear Blocker, for complete protection. Does TunnelBear support streaming services? Unfortunately, TunnelBear doesn’t currently guarantee users will be able to bypass geo-restrictions that many major streaming services enforce. That’s not to say no streaming services will work while using TunnelBear, and it’s possible that many might, and there could be certain workarounds. However, with their fairly limited range of servers, many TunnelBear VPN connections have already been identified and blocked by streaming services. How much does TunnelBear cost? There’s no extra cost for downloading and using the TunnelBear Chrome extension, and in actual fact, you can even use 500 MB of data over the VPN service for free. However, to use the full client for Android on your Chromebook past your free allowance, you’ll need a subscription. TunnelBear is one of the most affordable VPN services, at just $3.33 per month – with no hidden costs or lengthy subscription services. You can even pay for your subscription in Bitcoin at no extra cost! Contract Length Monthly Price First 500 MB Free Monthly $3.33 TunnelBear for Chrome verdict If you’re a casual user, who simply wants a VPN Chrome extension to limit intrusive adverts, and encrypt your traffic, then you’ll likely love the simplicity and 500MB of free data from TunnelBear. Sign up to TunnelBear However, we can’t recommend only using the TunnelBear browser extension, or free data, if you need a high level of protection. If you need to protect your privacy and encrypt your traffic, for instance doing business work over a public WiFi network, then we recommend you download a full Android client for your Chromebook. TunnelBear is definitely aimed at a more casual range of users than ExpressVPN, NordVPN, or CyberGhost – which we’ll look at below. For instance, there’s no specific access to specialty servers, and the level of protection and server locations are limited compared to competitors. Nevertheless, as a basic VPN for front-line protection on public networks and while bypassing geo-restrictions, TunnelBear’s full client for Chromebook and their Google Chrome extension is a great choice – and a very affordable one too. Private Internet Access Private Internet Access , often abbreviated to ‘PIA’, is a veteran VPN provider who have been in business for almost 20 years, providing its users with exactly what it says on the tin – greater privacy while browsing the web.P Although it’s not as well known as NordVPN or ExpressVPN, PIA has a lot of features to offer, and it’s also compatible with Chromebook – albeit with a little advanced setup that might not be suitable for beginners. PIA does however have a very well designed Google Chrome extension, which provides additional protection while in a Chrome session, and it’s well worth considering. Let’s discover its features. The PIA Chrome extension has over 100,000 downloads and a 4-star user rating. PIA Chrome extension features PIA provides a highly secure Chrome extension. Like other extensions, the PIA Chrome extension sits in the top right corner of your browser, and doesn’t show you unnecessary alerts or pop-ups. Turning it on only takes one click, and there’s a huge range of countries and servers to choose from. We like the red lock icon, which indicates you’re not connected to one of PIA’s VPN servers, so you can tell at a glance whether you’re protected or not. The Chrome extension also includes: WebRTC blocking – Prevent your location data reaching the sites you browse through PIA’s WebRTC blocking, which obfuscates your IP address and stops third-party tracking. Latency priority – A feature we haven’t seen advertised with other services, PIA’s server gateways are sorted by latency – the time it takes to communicate with the server – so you’ll always get the best possible connection, and the best possible browser experience. URL whitelist – Another nice feature that PIA allows is manual whitelisting of websites you regularly visit, or those you don’t mind sharing your personal information with. An example of this may be an email login, or a forum you frequently log in to. P2P supported – PIA also allows peer-to-peer downloading, perfect for sharing or transferring files and using torrent sites. Is PIA secure? As one of the longest serving VPNs in the world, PIA is trusted by millions of users, and recommended by multiple companies including Forbes, Wired, and Business Insider. The VPN provider uses 3,332 servers worldwide, located in 45 different countries, and it also offers users the opportunity to perform a range of privacy tests, such as DNS leak tests, IPv6 leaks, and email leaks via their website. PIA is definitely a secure VPN provider, with a focus on maintaining users rights to privacy online – which they regularly publish thought-leadership on, and donate to a number of internet freedom’s groups. Does PIA support streaming services? PIA does support certain streaming services in some locations, however for the vast majority of streaming services they can’t guarantee access to all users. This is mainly because PIA has focused on providing streaming access to the most popular geolocations, and as a result some users from certain countries have reported difficulty accessing streaming services through PIA. How much does PIA cost? Before we get into cost, let’s have a look at the ways you can pay for your PIA subscription. Being leaders in privacy, PIA let their users pay in Bitcoin, and also a huge range of popular gift cards and store cards – so you don’t have to reveal your payment data or personal information. If you’re really interested in totally preserving your privacy, you could buy a gift card in cash at your local store, and redeem it for your subscription. This is a feature we really like, as it shows PIA go above and beyond in protecting their user’s private data. They’re pricing is attractive too. Their cheapest subscription starts at just $39.95 per year, or the equivalent of $3.33 per month, which puts PIA on par with TunnelBear. If you want to pay monthly, it’s $9.95 per month – so buying a yearly subscription will save you 67%, paying for itself in just four months. Contract Length Monthly Price Monthly $9.95 6 Months $5.99 Yearly $3.33 PIA Chrome extension verdict Overall, PIA can definitely attest to being one of the most secure and privacy conscious VPN services, and their commitment to preserving individual internet freedoms says good things for their approach to keeping user logs and protecting your information. Their Chrome extension is good, it’s got all the features you’d expect including HTTPS upgrade and WebRTC blocking, which is active even when there’s no VPN connection established. We also like the fact that PIA allows users to pay in Bitcoin, or through gift cards bought with cash from many major retailers, which basically enables users to make every single part of their account completely private. However, PIA will probably appeal to the more advanced user, especially for Google Chromebook users, who will have to manually configure some information to connect to a server, rather than simply downloading a full client. Sign up to PIA Nevertheless, if it’s total privacy and anonymity you’re looking for online, look no further than PIA. CyberGhost VPN Established in 2011, CyberGhost has grown to be one of the most popular VPN providers, and have attracted a large and dedicated user base through their commitment to transparency and customer service. We’ve previously reviewed and recommended CyberGhost , and it certainly doesn’t disappoint on features. Sign up to CyberGhost Unfortunately, there’s no full client currently available for Chromebook users. However, CyberGhost do have a totally free Google Chrome extension with limited server options which is worth a look, and there are ways to connect to their servers from a Chromebook if you’re more experienced. CyberGhost’s Chrome extension has 200,000 downloads and a 4.2-star user rating on the Google web store. CyberGhost Chrome extension features CyberGhost provide a free Chrome extension, but with limited features. CyberGhost’s tray icon is a small ghost in the top right hand corner of your browser – but it’s actual browser extension window is the largest and one of the best looking that we’ve reviewed here. With a huge power button to turn the VPN on, and a quick drop-down menu to choose your VPN location, CyberGhost’s Chrome extension is one of the easiest to use and activate. You can connect for free to Germany, the U.S., the Netherlands, and Romania, with unlimited bandwidth – but do bear in mind that it’s only your Chrome session that’s protected, not your entire connection. You don’t need to download a client for your Chromebook to use the CyberGhost Chrome extension, but nevertheless we recommend you configure a separate connection anyway for full protection – although there’s some technical know-how needed for this. Is CyberGhost secure? To ensure the security and stability of its network, CyberGhost has invested in some of the best infrastructure in the world, including: Thousands of servers – CyberGhost has the most servers of any VPN provider we’ve reviewed here, with over 6,400 dedicated VPN servers in 90 countries worldwide, providing stable and uninterrupted service. Military-grade encryption – All traffic passed through CyberGhost’s servers, including that which passes through their Chrome extension, is protected with AES 256-bit encryption, making it impossible to intercept. Bitcoin subscriptions – Like PIA, CyberGhost lets users pay in Bitcoin for their VPN subscription. Using a throw away email to sign-up and paying in Bitcoin provides complete anonymity. The service also has a number of other innovative features, such as NoSpy servers which are controlled completely by the CyberGhost team, no logs policies, and multi-device support. Some of these features are not available through their Chrome extension. Does CyberGhost support streaming services? CyberGhost’s full VPN does support all major streaming services, and they guarantee that their users will be able to access the likes of Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and even regional services like the BBC through their VPN. However, it’s not clear if this same support also extends to their free Chrome extension. It’s unlikely that all streaming services are available through the extension, as there’s only a limited number of servers to choose from. How much does CyberGhost VPN cost? Even though you can access the Google Chrome extension for free, we highly recommend purchasing a subscription for more complete protection and access to premium features. CyberGhost are one of the cheapest VPN providers, with subscriptions from just $2.75 per month – although you’ll need to purchase a three-year plan worth $99 to get this price. Monthly subscriptions cost $12.99, or a 1-year plan is just $71.88, equivalent to $5.99 per month. Contract Length Monthly Price Monthly $12.99 Yearly $5.99 Three Years $2.75 CyberGhost Chrome extension verdict It’s free, but is it any good? It’s certainly a decent service for a freemium product. Naturally, CyberGhost encourages users to subscribe to their service, and as a result their Chrome extension is quite limited. There’s only a few servers to choose from, which might not suit people who put their privacy first, and it’s got a limited choice of country location. For those who aren’t sure if they need a Chrome VPN extension, it’s a good way to get to know how these add-ons work, but it’s certainly not comparable to NordVPN or ExpressVPN’s premium Chrome extensions. Sign up to CyberGhost It’s a shame that CyberGhost doesn’t currently have a full client for Chromebook users, and while this may change in the future, at the moment you’ll need to be a fairly advanced user to set up this VPN on your Chromebook device. What is the best VPN for Chrome in 2020? There’s always a winner in all walks of life – and VPN services for Chrome are no different. Some are definitely better than others, either with more in-browser utility or simply better access to servers. However, all of the VPNs we’ve looked at here have their own unique features, and we would gladly recommend them all for protection while you’re using a Chromebook or navigating the web inside the Chrome browser. But there’s a clear winner that not only offers the most for your money, but also has some of the best technical features of any VPN on the market, and looks great while doing it. NordVPN , a service we’ve previously given great reviews of in the past and it is currently ranked our best VPN overall. It also takes the number one spot for Chromebook and Chrome browser VPN providers. Sign up to Nordvpn It’s Chrome extension makes it easy to see where your most recent connections were and reconnect to them, it’s not intrusive and it doesn’t show unnecessary alerts, and it’s useful to see where you’re currently connected to on their icon. The other feature we like about NordVPN’s Google Chrome extension is that you’re logged in automatically if you have the full client for desktop, which saves time when you open a new Chrome session. NordVPN has a dedicated full client for Android, which is also configured to work with Google Chromebook devices, so you can cover both your device and browsing session if you need to. Despite scoring fairly low in their reviews, NordVPNs latest Google Chrome extension, released just four months ago, has some great new features which we think will push its ratings up. Overall, we highly recommend Google Chromebook owners and Chrome browser users to use NordVPN to protect their privacy while they browse the web!

BTC crossed the $41,000 mark early Monday, extending year-to-date gains to over 152%.  Click here to read CoinDesk's Most Influential list for 2023, a series of 50 profiles of key people, companies and trends in crypto.  Data from CoinGlass show, exchanges have liquidated crypto perpetual futures positions worth $220 million over the weekend. Bullish longs accounted for nearly 85% of the tally.  Over $120 million worth of bitcoin shorts, referring to bets against price rises, have been liquidated since Friday. Elsewhere, open interest grew 6% on Monday as traders increased leveraged positions to bet on further volatility.  Meanwhile, analysts at Coinanlyze told CoinDesk in an X message that open interest on the exchange BitMEX spiked 90% within hours to $420 million from over $200 million on Saturday – indicating a large player had opened massive bets on the platform.  Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.  Such data is beneficial for traders as it serves as a signal of leverage being effectively washed out from popular futures products – acting as a short-term indication of a decline in price volatility.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/04/bitcoins-price-rise-to-41k-buoyed-by-200m-in-weekend-short-liquidations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/880ad81d918806a5a64d28e92cb36ff9e5488daa-7731x5157.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419053,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUDVID,1701648060,Standard Chartered-Backed Zodia Custody Joins Ripple-Owned Metaco’s Global Crypto Storage Network,"Zodia Custody, a cryptocurrency storage provider backed by Standard Chartered (STAN), is joining Ripple-owned custody specialist Metaco's network, which is designed to handle the safekeeping and settlement of digital assets for institutions around the world, the firms said on Monday.  Crypto storage and settlement networks, where the assets remain in custody to remove counterparty risk, are becoming more popular, particularly in the wake of last year’s blow-ups and collapses of firms like FTX.  As this infrastructure component gradually evolves to resemble the way things are done in traditional finance, different types of networks will appear, said Zodia Custody CEO Julian Sawyer. Examples include the Copper Clear Loop system, which recently joined forces with BitGo’s Go network, or the self-custody off-exchange systems created by Fireblocks. Zodia itself offers an Interchange network.  The aim of integrating with Metaco’s network is to offer global sub-custody, banking parlance for when an institution contracts another custodian to hold assets for it, Sawyer said in an interview with CoinDesk.  “I think of this as the third generation of crypto custody, where multiple custodians are linked together,” he said. “For example, a client in Brazil, who is a custodian, may want to store some assets in the UK, and they're not currently in the UK. So they could use us as their sub-custodian and use our regulatory permissions, etc. I think the multiple networks that are out there are really key in terms of linking custodians together, and linking custodians to exchanges and venues in a compliant manner.”  Zodia Custody, which is currently registered in the U.K., Ireland, Luxembourg, recently set up shop in Singapore. While Zodia Markets, which is also backed by Standard Chartered, was recently granted approval in principle to operate as an over-the-counter (OTC) crypto broker-dealer in Abu Dhabi.
