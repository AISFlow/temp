42425103,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHr0nh,1383591651,BTC China beats Mt. Gox and Bitstamp to become the world's No. 1 bitcoin exchange,"BTC China has become the world's biggest digital currency exchange having handled a greater volume of bitcoins in the past week than Mt. Gox and Bitstamp.  More than 109,841 bitcoins have been exchanged on the site in the past seven days, compared with 93,372 on Bitstamp and 76,673 on Mt. Gox, according to data from Bitcoinity.org. In the past 24 hours alone, BTC China has processed 36,104 bitcoins, compared with Mt. Gox's 24,913 and Bitstamp's 23,214.  Bobby Lee, CEO of BTC China, said: ""It's an honor to see that BTC China has been propelled ahead to number one in the worldwide rankings. The real credit goes to the people in China, for having recognized the importance and value of bitcoin.""  He is not sure whether BTC China will be able to maintain its position at the top, asserting that ""nothing is permanent"".  Lee highlighted that, months ago, he predicted October would be a big month for bitcoin in China. ""The people here are really getting it, and it is being spread by both the general media and by word of mouth,"" he said.  Acceptance  More and more people in China are investing in bitcoin, but the opportunities to actually spend it are still limited. CoinDesk reported earlier today that a bar in Beijing is now accepting digital currency, but it is one of the only establishments in the country to do so.  Lee believes bitcoin currently has value not because of the amount of merchants that accept it, but because of its unique characteristics as a scarce, open-source, decentralized and distributed digital asset that has no third party risk.  ""Once people recognize these valuable attributes, then it will be natural for more people to demand it. Once demand goes up, people (and merchants) will be willing to accept it as a form of payment,"" he added.  Lee thinks what is currently happening in China is just the beginning of a worldwide trend and that bitcoins will soon be accepted into society and people's daily lives across the world. ""Since China is the world's most populous country, it's reasonable to see that China is also one of the first countries to really embrace bitcoin.""  Price  Lee said the pick up in interest in China has caused the price of bitcoin to rise. He thinks prices will continue to go up in the coming years, as more and more people worldwide become aware of digital currency.  He said that at the current circulation value of CNY ¥16 billion ($2.6 billion), it is still a small fraction of what it should be for a truly global asset class.  There is plenty of room for the price to increase, however, Lee is certain there will continue to be price bubbles and mini-crashes in the coming months and years.  ""It's only human nature for there to be frenzy buying and panic selling. With this human nature, I expect bitcoin prices to continue to be volatile in the coming years, until it reaches a more stable worldwide price point, which I expect to be much higher than today,"" he concluded.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/04/btc-china-beats-mt-gox-and-bitstamp-to-become-the-worlds-no-1-bitcoin-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90d9192dc98329bd14ec1d3b3d7b862ecb603056-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425119,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHr1Dh,1383582785,Farmers help bitcoin grow organically in Argentina,"Organic farmers in Argentina are finding bitcoin to be a compelling solution when selling their produce through a website called Tierra Buena. The website has been highlighted in a new short film by Jacob Hansen.  The film tells the story of how Nubis Bruno (one of the people behind the exchange site, Conectabitcoin) helped local farmers by creating the website as a means to sell their produce online in exchange for bitcoin or litecoin (and Pesos).  The existence of Tierra Buena doesn’t signal a pending economic revolution in Argentina, or anywhere else. However, it is a great anecdote of how digital currencies can be genuinely helpful.  It is also a way for the public to see how - the admittedly esoteric - digital currencies can have a tangible effect on down-to-earth activities.  In the short documentary, Santiago Zaz (the farmer behind Tierra Buena) describes how using bitcoin gave him the freedom to trade in his own way and not have to get permission from payment handlers for how he runs his business.  He even implies that being bound to a bank influenced the type of fertilizer and seeds he could use.  While the story of Tierra Buena is somewhat isolated, it is an interesting case study of how bitcoin can help stimulate independent and small-scale businesses.  Tierra Buena sells its goods online, which means it would normally have to go through a credit card handler or PayPal. Both charge fees on payments received by the merchant, which reduces their margins.  Furthermore, such payment handling bodies have specific terms of service that a business must adhere to.  Most of the time, such terms of service are there for a good reason, but in some cases they can be unnecessarily restrictive.  For example, Hansen said bank account regulations in his native Denmark are huge and provide a great amount of friction against launching a small business.  Therefore, bitcoin provides a compelling alternative in the face of overwhelming rules and regulations that may cause a chilling effect on businesses.  The other negative, of course, is the operation of illegal (ie black market) businesses. However, those who want to deal in such things will always find a way, and so ordinary people shouldn’t be closed out of something like bitcoin that can open so many positive doors too.  Both Hansen and Bruno told us that the volume of orders with Tierra Buena is still small, and that only 10% of orders are actually paid in bitcoin rather than Pesos (according to Bruno, litecoin orders are negligible).  [post-quote]  Furthermore, Bruno explained that most of that 10% of bitcoin-paying customers are either expats or people from the technology sector.  The fact that Tierra Buena’s customers are such a select group is a telling observation that most people still are either unaware or non-cognisant of bitcoin.  Mainstream acceptance is a huge challenge for bitcoin. To get there, it must gain trust and become far easier to use than it is now.  However, as more small businesses find a genuine place for bitcoin, consumers will be exposed to the digital currency more often – and so an educational effect will gradually take place, as long as businesses find bitcoin to be a worthwhile option.  The recurring theme in Bruno’s and Hansen’s documentary is that of removing middlemen. They have found that payment handlers play an ever stifling role in the operation of small businesses, such as the organic farmers of Tierra Buena.  Since bitcoin is peer to peer and allows money to flow directly from customer to merchant, such middlemen are removed from the equation.  That peer to peer nature also allows a third party to set up the payment channel with no involvement by the merchant.  This is useful in cases such as Tierra Buena where the technical aspects are not well understood by the merchants. Another example of small businesses benefitting from a no middleman model can be found in our article about The Roast Station Project.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | LTC,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2013/11/04/farmers-help-bitcoin-grow-organically-in-argentina,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/28ca61b94013e480fb7efa23262a9378f9381104-1000x664.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425116,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHr1Bh,1383576429,Coinkite and Virtex trial bitcoin debit cards and POS terminals,"Bitcoin debit cards and point of sale terminals are coming to Canada. Two Canadian companies - Coinkite and Virtex - are about to offer them, each taking a different approach.  The biggest problem getting a physical merchant to accept bitcoin is probably the interface. A lot of small business retailers like the black box nature of a point of sale system.  They can buy it and have it installed without having to know much about it. Understanding the nuances of QR codes, exchange rates and confirmation times is beyond many, as is fiddling with phone- and tablet-based wallets and scanners.  Coinkite  wants to bridge the gap between bitcoin and small brick-and-mortar retailers by offering them and their customers a three-part ecosystem: a POS service, debit card, and ‘cryptobanking’ infrastructure.  Why cryptobanking and not banking? Firstly, the Canadian firm doesn’t want to get into hot water with regulators by calling itself a bank, and secondly, it won’t be dealing in fiat currency at all.  “We figured out after talking to a lot of retailers that they want the hard, rugged POS machines,” said Coinkite CEO Rodolfo Novak. The company has experience with iOS development, but he says that retailers find them cumbersome. He added:  “People will start to adopt the tools that they are already used to.""  The firm will provide retailers with a traditional POS terminal, commissioned from a Chinese manufacturer. This will accept a Coinkite debit card, which uses chip and pin technology.  As with conventional fiat chip and pin, the card itself won’t hold any bitcoins. They will be held in a central Coinkite account. Coinkite will host accounts for bitcoin users, and merchants.  When presented with a debit card, the POS will scan the chip to ensure that the pin used is legitimate, and will send details of the transaction to Coinkite, which will authorize the transaction.  The retailer can set the rate, says Novak, and can also set the confirmation time, although there are defaults for those who don’t want to.  The POS also scans conventional QR codes, so that debit cards aren’t necessary.  But the advantage of using the debit card is that Coinkite has both the merchant and the customer’s funds, enabling it to verify that there is enough money in the customer’s account, thereby making instant, zero-confirmation transactions safer, Novak said. These transactions will still be conducted on the block chain.  Coinkite is hoping to sidestep any regulatory problems by avoiding dealing in fiat altogether. It will hold both litecoins and bitcoins, and will offer an API for exchanges, to which customers can then use to transfer their bitcoins.  The firm is already talking to QuickBT, along with Calgary-based exchange Virtex.  Virtex  Virtex is also beta testing its own debit cards, designed to work with ATM and POS terminals in Canada.  The advantage for this company is that it is an exchange with a money services business license, enabling it to deal in both fiat and cryptocurrency.  Its debit card will allow users to translate the bitcoins in their account into Canadian dollars, that can then be withdrawn from the 58,000-machine Canadian Interac ATM network.  It will also allow those converted coins to be used to make purchases at 753,000 Interac-based POS terminals.  The firm is in phase 1 beta with the cards, which requires the cards to be loaded manually by administrative staff.  In phase 2, it will enable automatic, instant loading using an online option on your Virtex account. The firm’s banking partner will offer free online real-time statements.  The fee structures for these cards are different. There will be a $2 ATM cash withdrawal fee from Virtex with the Virtex card, along with an ATM partner withdrawal fee, which averages around $1.50.  Coinkite offers a free account with a 2.47% withdrawal charge, or paid accounts starting at 0.5BTC per year, with free withdrawals.  The first batch of debit cards will arrive from China by mid-November, and the company is now testing the POS unit, said Novak. “We plan on shipping the first batch [of POS units] in Q1”. Cards will ship before then.  If POS systems can be made to work, using either or both of these approaches, then this could be the shot in the arm that bitcoin needs for bricks and mortar merchant adoption.  The Coinkite approach has the advantage that no fiat transfer is needed at all – people can send bitcoins to their Coinkite account from whichever wallet they choose, and spend them directly.  If they are able to trade goods and services in bitcoin, then they could effectively avoid exchange fees altogether, whereas these fees are a part of the Virtex model.  The key will be persuading enough merchants to accept the coin. Novak describes “insane demand” from merchants. Q1 should be a revelatory three months.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/04/coinkite-and-virtex-trial-bitcoin-debit-cards-and-pos-terminals,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/60ecd179ded866afd84d5ef7c2d1f981b7665b42-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425113,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHr13h,1383567041,eBay president John Donahoe: PayPal may accept bitcoin in the future,"The president of eBay has revealed that his company is preparing to expand the range of digital currencies it accepts.  In an interview with the Financial Times, John Donahoe even went as far to say that PayPal could, one day, incorporate bitcoin.  He said digital currency is going to be a ""very powerful thing"", but said the ecommerce group is first going to focus on incorporating reward points from retailer loyalty schemes into its PayPal wallet.  Donahoe said using PayPal as a digital wallet will make it a lot easier for consumers to keep track of their reward points.  When asked specifically about bitcoin, he said eBay was not currently working on expanding its PayPal wallet to include the digital currency, but ""we are watching it"".  This isn't the first time someone at eBay/PayPal has indicated that the company is interested in bitcoin. Back in April, David Marcus, president of PayPal was asked by Bloomberg what his views are on virtual currencies, he said:    ""I've been spending a lot of time looking at it and it's truly fascinating. The way that the currency has been designed and the way inflation is built in to pay for miners and all of that is truly fascinating.      I think for us at PayPal, it's just a question of whether bitcoin will make its way … as a funding instrument or not. We're kind of thinking about it.""    Members of the online forum reddit had varied views on the significance of Marcus' comments.  LyndseySimon said there were only two reasons Marcus would mention bitcoin on such a public platform: ""[PayPal is] either very close to launch and wanting to generate buzz (unlikely), or they're floating the idea to gauge response.""  However, -Mahn responded: ""Maybe so, but nonetheless this was just an interview where the question popped and he spoke his thoughts at the moment. It's great he feels positive about Bitcoin, but we shouldn't read too much into it just yet.""  What do you think about Marcus and Donahoe's comments? How long do you think it will be before PayPal integrates bitcoin?

42425115,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHr19h,1383561047,First bar to accept bitcoin arrives in China,"Bitcoin is slowly but surely spreading through Asia's big cities via the international social scene. Now you can have a good night out in Beijing on digital cash.  The Cafe Bar 2nd Place is a small but funky venue in Beijing's Wudaokou neighbourhood, 10km from the city center and a popular hangout for students at several nearby universities. Last week, it made Chinese history by becoming the first bar known to accept payments in bitcoin.  ""I did it to attract new customers and also for my own self study,"" said 'Rin', 2nd Place's Japanese proprietor. He opened the bar in June 2011, and it caters to the lunch and overnight crowds from Monday to Sunday.  As well as operating the bar, Rin has a business producing original brand bags.  News of bitcoin began to spread mainly through resident expats, with curious locals joining in to help spread the word. The Beijing Bitcoin meetup group has been holding its meetings at 2nd Place since around April 2013.  It was an American living in Beijing, Jake Smith, who convinced Rin of bitcoin's viability as an everyday payment option.  As well as organizing some Beijing Bitcoin meetups, Smith has already managed to convince a couple of other local businesses to accept it as well, such as IJustWannaBuy.com and entrepreneur hangout The Garage Cafe, though 2nd Place is the first bar.  Smith got into bitcoin himself through earlier (and less successful) attempts to mine it himself and buy through Mt. Gox.  He became more serious after buying some coins from a new roommate who was a miner, became hooked, and now works full time for BitFund.pe, a bitcoin-dominated private equity fund.  Smith said 2nd Place is one of his favorite watering holes in Beijing. He has been going there regularly for almost a year and talking to the bartender, Rin, about bitcoin.  ""He was always apprehensive but curious, and as I started doing more and more interesting stuff (traveling for bitcoin related work, and getting a full time job in bitcoin space), I think he started to realize that bitcoin is actually serious business and began asking more and more questions about it.""  He went on to say that, about a week ago, he visited the bar and without even mentioning bitcoin to Rin, he said he would like to start accepting the digital currency.  Rin's current arrangement for transforming his bitcoins into local currency is still a little more informal than other businesses who had to set up transfer procedures through BitPay or similar.  ""Rin is still not a bitcoin user himself; we made an arrangement that he keeps track of the RMB value of the drinks paid for in bitcoin, and then I settle the bill with him and receive the BTC he's collected. But he checks out the BTC price every day now, and it's my hope that sooner rather than later, one day he'll tell me he doesn't want to sell me the BTC and just hold onto it instead.""  Rin himself confessed to not knowing much about bitcoin or what could be done to increase recognition in other parts of China or Asia in general.  ""To be honest I haven't dealt with bitcoin much yet myself so I don't entirely understand it. Some of our local customers are involved in bitcoin businesses. Awareness is increasing sharply around here,"" he said.  He has always been fairly bitcoin-friendly, and as well as hosting the meetups, he let Smith use 2nd Place outside business hours to film an interview with CCTV (China Television).  A local Beijing Reddit user 'wudaokor' is apparently spreading the word further by entering a 'Bitcoin Team' at local pizza restaurant and bar Lush/Pyro's pub quiz. Getting the bar to also start accepting bitcoin was next, wudaokor wrote.  ""The more people that show up, the more oomph there is behind the message that accepting bitcoin can create business, so I'd like to get as many people to go as possible,"" he added.  (NB: the interview with Rin was conducted in Japanese; his responses have been translated into English.)",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | TRADING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/04/first-bar-to-accept-bitcoin-arrives-in-china,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f74868c7e6f724aa0448fe4404a79eb47c87fe21-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
