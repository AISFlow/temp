42429933,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2BZh,1541454334,Crypto Exchange Bitstamp Aims to Get Faster with Tech Upgrade,"Cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp is getting a new matching engine developed by Cinnober, a global provider of exchange and clearing technology whose clients are mostly traditional stock and commodity markets.  Cinnober's TRADExpress Trading System will replace Bitstamp's in-house matching engine, the companies announced Monday.  The new system will drastically increase the exchange's capacity to match orders, which is especially important in periods of high market activity like last December's rally, Bitstamp's CTO David Osojnik told CoinDesk.  Through a representative, Osojnik explained:  ""Our order matching speed is expected to become 1,250 times faster, while throughput will increase by 400 times. The increased throughput will ensure our platform is able to meet any level of demand. Our matching engine was already powerful enough to stay online through the massive rally last winter and this move will ensure trading on our platform remains stable no matter what.""  This speed boost will, in turn, help Bitstamp develop an institutional trading service, Osojnik went on, allowing the exchange ""to add additional order types and trading pairs without a drop in performance and as well as provide a new direct API endpoint.""  The new matching engine will be implemented in a few phases, with the first changes taking place in the first quarter of next year and completion expected by the end of June, Bitstamp said.  Old world meets new  For Bitstamp, which was one of the first crypto exchanges to acquire a payment institution license in the EU back in 2016, the new trading system will be another step to establish itself as a bridge between crypto and traditional finance,CEO Nejc Kodrič said in a press release.  ""Our matching engine will be on par with traditional exchanges in both speed and throughput,"" Kodrič said. ""We chose Cinnober because of their proven track-record in worldwide financial marketplaces.""  Founded in 1998, Stockholm-based Cinnober is known for powering traditional exchanges with its software, among them the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), Brazil's B3, Dubai Gold & Commodities Exchange (DGCX), Japan Exchange Group (JPX), the London Metal Exchange (LME), the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), and others.  Peter Lenardos, CEO of the Cinnober Group, said his company's new system will help Bitstamp provide stable service to its users. ""By upgrading their trading technology to further improve performance and stability as interest from investors and regulators grow, they demonstrate their firm commitment to providing a safe and reliable marketplace,"" he said in the press release.  Bitstamp was founded in 2011 and now has branches in London, Luxembourg, Slovenia and the U.S. As CoinDesk reported in October, a majority ownership stake in Bitstamp has just been bought by NXMH, an investment firm owned by South Korean conglomerate NXC and based in Belgium.

42429932,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2BXh,1541446627,"Musk Impostors Hack Lawmaker, Publisher Accounts in New Crypto Scams","A number of verified Twitter accounts were compromised Monday – including those owned by a U.S. lawmaker, a film company, and a book publisher – all to impersonate SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk.  Each of the compromised accounts engaged in a well-known crypto giveaway scam by promising to send large amounts of bitcoin to any users who sent them small amounts first.  To further reinforce the impression that the compromised accounts were genuinely owned by Musk, the hackers copied over the Tesla founder's profile picture and retweeted some of his tweets. Some accounts also pinned the bitcoin giveaway tweet.  The tweets stated that participants should verify themselves by sending 0.1 - 3 BTC to a particular wallet address and on receipt, they would get anywhere between 1 and 20 BTC.  Several users familiar with the scam attempted to alert the community about these fakes.  One of the most prominent victims was perhaps the Democratic state representative for New Jersey's sixth district, Frank Pallone Jr.  Around mid-day, Pallone's campaign handle, ""@pallonefornj,"" was taken over. Notably, his account comes with an election label specifying that he is a U.S. House candidate for New Jersey, though his other verified handle, ""@FrankPallone,"" remained untouched.  Daily Beast reporter Lachlan Markay reported that sources familiar with the campaign had confirmed the account was compromised and Twitter was investigating.  The tweet about the bitcoin giveaway was identical to the one posted on the Pathe Film account, once again promising 1-20 BTC in exchange for the small verification fee of 0.1-3 BTC. This was once again caught by people in crypto-industry.  https://twitter.com/JonathanVaage/status/1059484895821606912  By press time, the promotional tweet (which are paid for in an effort to reach a wider audience) had been removed, along with the profile image and name on the @pallonefornj account. Some retweets from the real Elon Musk account were still on the page.  Similarly, the official account of English discount clothing and homeware chain Matalan was hacked to display the same fraudulent message, attracting over 700 retweets and over 3,000 likes.  Hackers also took over film production company Pathé Film's Twitter account ""@patheuk"", in order to mimic the account of the Tesla CEO and tweet out spurious bitcoin giveaway links. However, the company later announced that it had regained control of its account.  As reported earlier this month  , this not the first case of multiple ""Musks"" promoting crypto giveaway scams. The issue has become serious enough to prompt the social networking company to take action, and freeze any account that changes its display name to ""Elon Musk.""  The Pallone and Matalan accounts directed users to send some portion of bitcoin to the same address, which has received 326 transactions worth a total of more than 25 bitcoin ($161,380) as of press time, according to data from Blockchain.com.  The Pantheon account directed users to a different address, which saw a further $12,000 in bitcoin over a two-and-a-half-hour period, while the Patheon UK account only received around $2,500.  Both addresses continued to receive bitcoin transactions as of press time, though it's unclear at this time how many transactions are legitimate and which ones are intended to boost the address figures.  Requests for comment to Pallone's campaign team, Matalan, Pantheon, Musk's office and Twitter were not immediately returned.

42429925,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2BLh,1541440839,Swiss Finance Watchdog Tells Banks to Treat Crypto Trading As High Risk,"Switzerland's Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) is giving tough guidance to banks wanting to trade in crypto assets.  According to a report from Swissinfo.ch, FINMA has issued a confidential letter – seen by the news agency – to accountancy organization EXPERTsuisse, stating its stance on how financial institutions should weight crypto assets when calculating loss-absorbing capital buffers.  FINMA said it advises banks and securities dealers to assign a ""flat risk weight of 800% to cover market and credit risks"" against crypto assets. That means, for instance, if the current price of bitcoin is $6,000, institutions would have to value each coin on their books at $48,000 when deciding on an adequate level of buffer.  The guidance is on the high end of the range and on the level of hedge funds, according to the report, meaning FINMA considers crypto assets to be volatile.  Swissinfo.ch reports that FINMA has also set a crypto-trading cap at 4 percent of a bank's total capital, and said they must report to the authority if they reach that upper limit.  While the letter offers insight into the regulator's stance and outreach on this issue, it hasn't yet released official rules for how Swiss banks should deal with cryptocurrencies under the Basel III international banking regulations, according to the report.  Back in February, FINMA did issue official guidance for initial coin offerings (ICOS) after receiving a large number of enquiries on the issue.  The regulator said at the time that it would determine the applicability of regulation to crypto tokens on a case-by-case basis, taking a similar stance to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in its guidance, released last July.  In particular, the agency said it regards ""asset tokens"" as securities, which means that there are securities and civil law requirements for trading such tokens. ""Payment tokens"" and ""utility tokens"" were unlikely to sit in the securities category, FINMA said.

42421064,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXCs3R,1541437230,Deltec Chairman Says Tether Letter on Bank Relationship Is 'Authentic',"The chairman of Deltec Bank & Trust says a widely scrutinized letter about stablecoin issuer Tether's account at the Bahamas-based institution is ""authentic.""  The letter, which Tether published Nov. 1, stated – albeit with a prominent disclaimer – that the company held an account at the bank, and that the account's balance as of Oct. 31 was over $1.8 billion, enough to back all the USDT tokens in circulation 1-for-1. However, as CoinDesk and Bloomberg reported, Deltec would not initially confirm the relationship with Tether.  As she had in previous conversations with CoinDesk, the bank's spokeswoman Melanie Hutcheson said that she could not share information on client relationships due to legal restrictions and the bank's own policies. (The Bahamas' banks and trust companies regulation contains language preventing bank employees and others from disclosing customer information ""without the express or implied consent of the customer concerned."")  The squiggle of signature on the letter, and the absence of an individual employee's name, also made it seemed dubious to some.  Yet in a subsequent conversation on Nov. 1, Deltec chairman Jean Chalopin shared a link to the letter with CoinDesk, saying ""Tether came public with an announcement and I wanted to make sure you saw it.""  While that message appeared to confirm the letter's authenticity, Chalopin did not say so directly – until Saturday, when he sent CoinDesk a subsequent message, writing:  ""The letter published by Tether is authentic.""  Chalopin's confirmation means that for the first time in months, Tether's banking relationship is public knowledge and has been confirmed by the banking partner in question.  In early 2017 Tether and Bitfinex – a cryptocurrency exchange with shareholders and executives in common with Tether – lost access to Taiwanese banks after Wells Fargo cut off correspondent banking services for the Taiwanese banks, due to their relationship with Tether.  A relationship with the Puerto Rico-based Noble Bank reportedly followed, though neither Tether nor Noble (nor Bitfinex) ever publicly confirmed the relationship.  After that fell through in late September or early October, a period of uncertainty followed, during which Bitfinex announced that the firm was ""not insolvent"" and urged customers on its platform to ""keep this [banking] information to yourself"" to avoid damage ""not just to yourself and Bitfinex, but the entire digital token ecosystem.""  Tether's exchange rate, which is designed to hew as close as possible to the U.S. dollar, dropped precipitously in mid-October, owing to the market's lack of confidence in Tether's banking relationships. (According to the Tether white paper, dollar parity is maintained through full fiat currency backing, specifically, bank accounts holding U.S. dollars.)  'An established form of discrimination'  In his most recent message to CoinDesk, Chalopin reiterated that Bahamian law prevented Deltec from divulging information about clients.  ""As I am sure you know,"" he wrote, ""we are restricted by laws and by our policies to comment on any matter related to our clients and even to confirm if we have or not a client.""  Chalopin also stressed that Deltec's compliance with laws and regulations, including anti-money laundering and combatting the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) rules, which have often made banks reluctant to provide services to cryptocurrency issuers and exchanges, as well as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), a U.S. law intended to prevent tax evasion using foreign bank accounts, and the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), an international standard intended to prevent tax evasion  ""Deltec conducts all its affairs and client's matters in a manner that is fully compliant with all applicable banking regulations,"" he wrote, ""and consistent with our internal policies with respect to safety and sound risk management, and we can't break these rules without serious consequence.""  Chalopin suggested that any questions about Deltec's compliance arise from negative stereotypes about the so-called offshore banking industry, telling CoinDesk:  ""The sole fact that we are based in The Bahamas exposed us constantly to an established form of discrimination at the hand of bigger countries and other large financial institutions, under various pretexts, though we have strict and uncompromised AML/CFT policies, are fully compliant with international transparency agreements such as FATCA and CRS, and have risk management and safety financial ratios that are significantly better than most other banks.""  He also appeared to criticize media coverage of the unfolding story around Deltec and Tether, saying: ""we are unfortunately used to deal[ing] with unfair attacks and unfounded statements. We live in a strange world where people can say anything they want about other people without proof or verification.""  Addressing the letter Tether posted to its site, Chalopin explained, ""In the present case, since Tether came public with our letter, the only thing I can do is to confirm that the letter published by Tether is authentic.""  He did not address the letter's specific contents, the most notable of which is of course Tether's bank balance.  The letter itself contains language apparently intended to minimize Deltec's exposure to potential legal challenges: ""This letter is provided without any liability, however arising, on the part of Deltec Bank & Trust Limited, its officers, directors, employees and shareholders, and is solely based on the information currently in our possession.""

42429917,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2BBh,1541434075,SEC Official Says 'Plain English' Guidance On ICOs Is Coming,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to clarify when and how cryptocurrencies may be classified as securities, its director of Corporation Finance said Monday.  Speaking at the D.C. Fintech Week conference, SEC director William Hinman said the regulatory agency intends to release ""plain English"" guidance for developers to refer to when planning token offerings. This guidance will help such developers determine on their own whether any potential token offering may be classified as a security or not, according to Hinman, though it's not clear when the guidance will be published.  Hinman explained at the event:  ""We also will be putting out more guidance, the idea is a plain English instrument that people can look at and they'll bring together sort of my Howey-meets-Gary speech, and that analysis ... We'll elaborate on that in a very plain English way, so 'do I think I have a security offering,' look at that guidance and you should be able to sort things out.""  If developers are still uncertain about whether their token offerings are securities or not, they can get in touch with the SEC's new FinHub, which is aimed at providing rapid feedback on questions about securities and security offerings, he said.  ""Once you determine whether you have a security, we're going to have in that guidance, 'how do I go about registering' and 'how do I go about doing an exempt offering,'"" Hinman added.  The issues the SEC is examining include accounting, custody and token valuation, he went on to explain. Some of the draft registration statements sent to the regulator so far have similarly touched on these concerns.  ""I think we can try to bring that together and share that ... we want to share that a little bit more transparently,"" he said.  The guidance will also address secondary market transactions, as part of an effort to give developers and entrepreneurs clarity on how the SEC might look at tokens post-initial offering.  When asked about how the SEC might classify a token sale as a securities offering, Hinman elaborated by noting that the agency would be looking at factors such as the expectation of a return on investment.  ""If someone's offering an instrument for money or other consideration to a third party, and that third party expects the offerer to generate a return or so something that will increase the value of the coin or token or whatever they want to call it, and there's that expectation of return, we're generally going to see that as a securities offering,"" he said.  Back in July 2017, the SEC published its report on the DAO, the now-defunct, ethereum-based funding vehicle that featured its own token that the agency later said was considered a security. At the time, the SEC notably declared that securities laws could apply to some token sales.  Hinman himself declared in June of this year that, in his view, ether – the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network – isn't a security.  William Hinman image from Yahoo!

The company announced in a press release Monday, that it has been investigating the outflow of funds from Zaif since soon after the hack, in association with Takayuki Sugiura at information-security consultancy L Plus and security experts from a ""capture the flag"" cybersecurity team called TokyoWesterns.  Once some of the stolen funds, in the monacoin cryptocurrency, started being moved late last month, Japan Digital Design said it was able to identify the ""source"" of the attackers.  The team added that it has shared this information with the authorities, saying: ""Since the Monacoin began moving from October 20, we estimated the source of 5 transactions in question and provided information to the authorities concerning the characteristics of the transaction originator.""  While there are few specific details provided and it is also unclear how accurate the data collected is, the release further states (via online translation):  ""In the investigation of the leaked virtual currency, remittance route has been analyzed through static analysis of the block chain, but with this effort, by deploying the virtual currency node on a large scale after the outflow of the virtual currency, we verified whether we can obtain clues such as source IP address etc. We also got useful data to grasp the accuracy of the information and the cost of tracking.""  Zaif, a licensed crypto exchange in Japan, was hacked in September, losing cryptocurrency worth around $60 million at the time, including bitcoin, bitcoin cash and monacoin.  Last month, Japanese financial regulator, the Financial Services Authority (FSA), said it was seeking information from Tech Bureau, the operator of Zaif, including why there was a delay in reporting the hack.  Tech Bureau also revealed in October a plan to compensate users who lost funds in the attack – a move that saw it sign an agreement to transfer the Zaif exchange business to publicly listed investment firm Fisco.

42429926,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2BNh,1541422801,Bitcoin's True Stress Test Is Yet to Come,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      Rekt? You should see the other guy.  For anyone concerned about bitcoin losing another 4 percent in October to post its third straight monthly loss, it's worth comparing that loss to those seen by traditional financial markets.  By standard measures, last month was the worst on Wall Street since the 2008 financial crisis. The Nasdaq lost 9.2 percent, the Dow Jones Industrials, 6.9 percent, and the S&P 500, 5.1 percent. Riskier markets such as tech stocks and emerging markets were hit especially hard.  A 4 percent decline is still hefty. But given its past volatility, the lead cryptocurrency's relative stability amid the angst on the Street is notable.  The general impression produced by last year's wild crypto bubble was that bitcoin and all other such tokens exist at the extreme end of the speculative class of assets. So, if world markets become risk-averse, as they did severely last month, the thinking was that people would dump bitcoin along with every other high-risk asset in their flight to dollars.  Instead, up until Monday, October 30, when bitcoin suffered a $200 drop, it was more or less stable. By crypto standards, it was a boring month.  It might be tempting to conclude that bitcoin is attracting a safe-haven bid, that people are looking to hedge their risks with a stable-yet-liquid asset that's immune from the politics of financial crises. The idea is that bitcoin is starting to assert itself as a new type of uncorrelated reserve asset, a digital gold for the digital age.  But the truth is there is very little of this safe-haven buying going on in bitcoin prices right now. There was no noticeable spike in transactions last month, just more of the very, very gradual increase that has occurred off the low base reached during the post-bubble period of the late winter.  While there are surely some newcomers shifting their assets into bitcoin, especially in places like Venezuela, there's no great wave of people suddenly realizing that this new digital asset might be a hedge against future political and economic turmoil.  Community turnover  So why did this notoriously volatile asset have a relatively quiet October?  One way to think about it is to reflect on the changing nature of the bitcoin investment community, which can be divided into speculators and buy-and-holders – better known as hodlers.  The speculators who dominated the community last year have gone – certainly the newcomers who drove the bitcoin price to its ridiculous peak above $19,000 in December. You know the type: your mother, your cousin or that high school friend you hadn't spoken to for years who asked for tips on what coins to buy.  That leaves the hodlers, the true believers, those in it for the long term. These people are far less likely to care about turmoil in world markets putting their dollar-based wealth at risk. Many don't even measure their risk exposure in dollar terms.  They don't – at least to a point. You see, here's the thing: This remaining community of hodlers may soon be the guinea pigs in a much more important bitcoin stress test.  What if things get ugly?  What happens if, as a number of market prognosticators believe, things get truly nasty economically?  I mean 2008-like nasty, when a financial crisis morphed into a full-blown economic crisis. Will these diehards resist liquidating their bitcoin assets then?  The answer may be a function of their real-world economic profiles. Do most of them comprise developers and entrepreneurs paid in bitcoin and ether whose expenditures are also largely for goods and services remunerated in the same? If they can subsist in the crypto economy, then maybe they'll keep hodling.  If they do hang on, they'll give bitcoin an impressive show of stability. Amid economic chaos, such resilience would look quite impressive to the outside world, potentially drawing another round of newcomers into the mix – not speculative ""too the moon"" lambo-hunters but people who get the idea that this is a valuable hedging asset for the digital economy.  The number of people who live in that crypto-dominant economy is bigger than is recognized by crypto critics, who tend to see every action of this community through the lens of investors marking their profits and losses to market in dollar terms. Still, it's difficult to say whether this group is big enough to offset the many others for whom a serious 2008-like blow to their fiat incomes will drive them to liquidate bitcoin along with other assets.  Complicating matters is the fact that a host of new exchanges, custodial services and trading platforms are coming that could attract large institutions into this market. There might be a sizable amount of Wall Street money coming into bitcoin over the coming year.  Bitcoin speculators hoping to turn their holdings into dollar-based fortunes tend to see this as a positive prospect, assuming the influx of funds will drive up the price. But while that might happen in the short term, the experience of last year, when short-selling accompanied the introduction of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's and Chicago Board Options Exchange's cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts, is that these professional solutions can also invite volatility.  These new institutional tools give the big guys greater capacity to get in, but they also give them the means to get out. Hedge funds are definitely not interested in hodling for holding's sake.  This stability may not last, in other words. It's another matter whether that provides the kind of stress test that bitcoin needs to prove itself as a reserve asset.

42429940,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2Blh,1541415624,Bitcoin Price Eyes Move to $6.8K After Bull Breakout,"Bitcoin could be about to make a move towards $6,800, having witnessed a bullish breakout yesterday.  The leading cryptocurrency, which had been in a narrowing price range, moved upwards to close at $6,423 yesterday, confirming an upside breakout of the symmetrical triangle pattern.  With the move, the bulls look to have come out victorious in a months-long tug-of-war with the bears. However, BTC is struggling to find acceptance above the immediate resistance of the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $6,450.  The EMA hurdle might be crossed in a day or two, though, as the ethereum-bitcoin exchange rate (ETH/BTC) is looking north, marking rising demand for alternative cryptocurrencies.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,400 on Coinbase, having clocked a high of $6,440 earlier today. The cryptocurrency is up 1 percent on a 24-hour basis and is largely unchanged week-on-week.  Daily chart  The symmetrical triangle breakout seen in the above chart indicates scope for a re-test of recent highs above $6,800.  That target looks achievable as the breakout is backed by a bullish crossover on the moving average convergence divergence (MACD). Further, the relative strength index is holding in bullish territory just above 50.00.  ETH/BTC daily chart  The falling channel breakout and a convincing move above the former support-turned-resistance of 0.031994 (Sept. 25 low) indicates a bearish-to-bullish trend change.  The rising MACD histogram is suggesting that further gains could be in the offing. The RSI of 53.00 is biased toward the bulls.  Thus, ETH/BTC looks set to rise in the near future.  View  Both BTC and the ETH/BTC are looking north after the technical breakout.  An increased risk appetite is seen lifting BTC above the 50-day EMA of $6,450. That would open the doors for a sustained rally to $6,810 (Oct. 15 high).  The short-term bullish outlook in BTC would be invalidated if prices see a UTC close below the Oct. 31 low of $6,200.

42429935,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2Bbh,1541410232,Firm Owned by India's Richest Man Turns to Blockchain for Trade Finance,"Oil and gas conglomerate Reliance Industries – owned by India's richest person, Mukesh Ambani – has used blockchain to conduct its first trade finance transaction.  According to a news release from HSBC India shared with CoinDesk on Sunday, Reliance Industries has recently executed a ""live"" blockchain-powered trade finance transaction in collaboration with US-based global chemical distributor Tricon Energy.  The end-to-end transaction was facilitated by banking majors HSBC India and ING Bank, Brussels, and carried out on enterprise consortium R3's Corda blockchain platform, the release adds.  The Corda platform was integrated with a platform provided by U.K.-based trade finance digitization firm Bolero International, and was used to issue and manage an electronic bill of lading.  Using the blockchain platform, a letter of credit was issued by ING Bank for Tricon Energy USA (the importer) with HSBC India as the advising and negotiating bank for Reliance Industries, India (the exporter), the release explains. A letter of credit is a bank guarantee for a buyer's payment to a seller.  HSBC India's head for global banking & markets, Hitendra Dave, said:  ""The use of blockchain is a significant step towards digitising trade. The overall efficiency it brings to trade finance ensures cost effectiveness, quicker turnaround and potentially unlocks liquidity for businesses.""  Currently, importers and exporters use paper-based letters of credit to underpin transactions, with each party sending documents either by post or fax. This manual process not only slows the pace of trade, but also increases the costs.  The blockchain-powered trade finance platform, on the other hand, is aimed to digitize that process, thereby saving time and cost.  ""The use of blockchain offers significant potential to reduce the timelines involved in exchange of export documentation from the extant 7 to 10 days to less than a day,"" said Srikanth Venkatachari, joint chief financial officer at Reliance Industries.

42429936,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2Bdh,1541404800,"No, Bitcoin Isn't Secretly Messing with the Mid-Term Elections","Brian Forde most recently ran for U.S. Congress in California's 45th district and was the founding Director of the Digital Currency Initiative at MIT. Previously, he was a Senior Tech Advisor in the Obama White House.      On the eve of the most important election of our time, we've seen what misinformation gets us. Fear of the unknown, fear of change. In these times, we need to be vigilant about how we examine what's new or different.  Hundreds of articles have been written about campaign contributions made with cryptocurrencies -- and all too often they get it wrong. Many of these articles are riddled with factual errors, but more distressingly engender fear of something new based on a deep misunderstanding.  I know because, during my recent run for Congress, approximately $300,000 of my campaign contributions were donated in cryptocurrency.  I wasn't a fringe candidate who rails against the government. I was a Senior Tech Advisor in President Obama's White House who wrote the White House memo on Bitcoin and briefed the president on the technology.  After leaving the White House, I started the research lab on cryptocurrencies at MIT to help the world better understand this emerging technology and its global impact – and that's what I seek to do in this article.  Here are some of the biggest misconceptions:  First, it's important to understand the scope of campaign contributions made with cryptocurrencies. One article claimed that U.S. Congressional candidates have raised $550,000 in cryptocurrencies since 2014. To put that figure in perspective, the amount is equal to 0.032 percent of the more than $1.7 billion that's been raised by candidates since the 2014 election cycle.While the amount donated in cryptocurrency is a fraction of one-tenth of a percent of total contributions, the author claims that the scope and threat are large because virtual currencies are used by more than 3 billion people. No, nearly 40 percent of the world's population does not use cryptocurrencies.The words virtual currencies, virtual money and cryptocurrencies are incorrectly used interchangeably. As a result, we end up with wildly inaccurate information being given in U.S. Congressional hearings and parroted in articles.Virtual currencies are the most expansive name and include products such as airline miles and Starbucks cards. Star Alliance points are not a threat to the integrity of our elections, nor are cryptocurrency users who likely number in the tens of millions.  Second, some claim cryptocurrencies have been linked to illicit activities including money laundering, without qualifying that the same is true of cash and credit cards. The UK government ranked ways that money was being laundered. Banks were number one and bitcoin was at the bottom of the list.On that basis, the means of payment should not be our litmus test to determine how candidates, or anyone, can or cannot receive money. If it was, we would not be able to use cash, credit cards, or bank accounts. They further assert that foreign state actors have used cryptocurrency to influence U.S. elections without critical clarifying details. Foreign state actors used cryptocurrency to buy internet domain names and pay for server infrastructure – not to donate to Congressional candidates.Technology has always been used for good and bad purposes. Cryptocurrencies are no different. In a free and open society, we don't ban the use of the internet or social media in response to nefarious uses by foreign actors.We work with leaders in the private sector, academia, and policymaking to develop sensible solutions to address the acute problem.  Third, critics also like to claim that unlike cash or checks, cryptocurrencies cannot be inspected easily by the public and that we should publish the wallet addresses of the contributions. Contributions made with cryptocurrencies require the same reporting requirements as contributions made with cash, checks and credits cards -- publishing the donor's full name and address.It's important to note that cash is the most anonymous form of payment in the world -- yet it is accepted by every campaign. The majority of campaign contributions are made with credit cards.The easiest way for a foreign actor to illegally contribute to a campaign is with a prepaid debit card bought with cash at a convenience store -- not cryptocurrencies.It would be a violation of an individual's financial privacy and security to publish their wallet address with their full name and home address. The same is true for publicly disclosing bank account numbers of donors who write checks or credit card numbers for those who contribute online. In fact, for security purposes, most campaigns don't have access to credit card numbers of donors.  Fourth, misguided analysts infer that bitcoin is a ""privacy coin"" and therefore anonymous. Actually, it's neither. It's important to know that the use of cryptocurrencies is highly regulated in the U.S.In fact, every American cryptocurrency wallet company is subject to strict know-your-customer and anti-money laundering laws, overseen by a U.S. Treasury Department agency, that requires wallet companies to know exactly who is using their wallets.  While bitcoin was invented more than 10 years ago, there are still far too many misconceptions about the technology. The misconceptions lead to fear and fear leads to hysteria. It's more important than ever that public officials are guided by facts and not hysteria.  For one, our elected representatives will be asked to regulate this new technology. Second, this technology is being developed for even greater participation.  In 2016, nearly 300,000 overseas voters who requested ballots were not able to return them to their county clerks. I wasn't surprised by this number. I lived abroad while serving in the Peace Corps and sent in my ballots only for them to be infrequently counted during my time in Nicaragua.  Bradley Tusk, a supporter of my campaign, is working with officials in West Virginia to address this by enabling our Americans serving abroad to vote with a mobile application built with the technology powering cryptocurrencies, blockchain. This technology will ensure 19,000 service men and women's votes -- which previously went uncounted -- are counted this midterm election.  So while cryptocurrencies are decidedly not ""messing"" with the mid-terms, the technology powering them could, in fact, make midterms more representative.  This is something worth understanding, and something worth writing about.

42429928,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyM2BPh,1541395289,Ethereum Energy Project Now Powers 700 Households in 10 Cities,"A little-known ethereum project called Lition is quietly helping real German citizens find cheaper energy.  Launched earlier this year, Lition is already a licensed energy supplier in Germany with clients in 12 major cities (including Berlin, Hamburg and Munich) who are now using its decentralized energy market. Built on top of the ethereum blockchain, the Lition market connects consumers directly with energy producers big and small.  In total, more than 700 households across Germany are now using the decentralized platform to buy their energy, according to the company.  In short, Lition is trying to change how global energy works with a concept very familiar to blockchain enthusiasts: ""bypassing unnecessary middlemen,"" saving its users money on energy.  In the case of the households, an energy supplier sells the solar or electric energy (or whatever type they've produced) to an intermediary, often a giant, multinational company. Customers then buy energy from that intermediary.  The problem is, in the eyes of Lition CEO Richard Lohwasser, these multinational intermediaries have too much influence and don't give users enough choice in what type of energy they can buy.  So, Lition's solution is to cut them out completely.  ""Our energy exchange connects customers and producers directly. Producers put their energy on the exchange and then customers can buy it,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""Usually buying directly from producers is limited to energy suppliers that are big corporations. We're bringing the exchange to the consumer, so consumers can pay for the energy they want.""  Cutting out the giants  Slicing out the middlemen also cuts costs – and not by a minuscule amount either. According to Lition, this saves customers an average of 20 percent on their utility bills, and increases power plant revenue by up to 30 percent.  That's even though Lition has a strong emphasis on ""green energy,"" which while better for the environment, is often more expensive. As the app demo shows, Lition users can choose from the categories of wind, solar or biomass, then choose which provider they like the best (which, Lohwasser said is usually just the cheapest option).  Once a user finds the energy they want to buy, they make a payment in euros to Lition. Behind the scenes, an ethereum smart contract detects this payment and automatically sends the customer their energy.  ""Lition's …. blockchain technology simplifies the process of buying energy directly from green producers of any scale by employing transparent smart contracts that allow consumers to circumvent all of the complexity of energy distribution brokers,"" the Lition website explains.  For now, users need to be from Germany, where Lition is licensed to operate. Those who are interested in purchasing energy using Lition's market can query on the Lition website, which also features a price estimator based on the user's postal code.  But Lohwasser sees all this is a proof-of-concept for a bigger goal.  Maybe, one day, anyone will be able to buy energy directly in this decentralized fashion, perhaps even from tiny solar farms set up by hobbyists in a neighborhood nearby.  Blockchain struggles  The bad news is that, like some other companies, they've had problems with ethereum.  ""Ethereum is not a good system,"" Lohwasser put his opinion bluntly.  As much as he appreciates that the platform is open and ""permissionless,"" meaning anyone can use it without filing a permission slip, he rattled off a long list of problems Lition users have faced.  ""It's very slow. It takes 20 to 30 seconds to tell a customer whether they can buy energy or not,"" he said, adding that as a company that's trying to promote renewable energy, they began to feel uneasy about using a system that relies on mining, which is a rather energy-sucking process.  Realizing all the high costs associated with the platform put Lition in a bit of a bind. They started a hunt for something better, but looking at at least a dozen blockchains, they couldn't find one that was both permissionless and scalable.  ""They all have their drawbacks,"" Lohwasser said. He seemed skeptical of private blockchains, different from its public cousin in that not just anyone can participate. ""You might as well not have a blockchain,"" he remarked.  So, they found partnering with one of the world's largest software companies, SAP, to build their own system, a ""hybrid"" blockchain for enterprise, which combines what they believe are the best aspects of private and public blockchains. SAP is working on the smart contract layer, while Litiom tackles the consensus layer.  The company is quick to stress that they managed to create all this technology without funding via an initial coin offering (ICO). The new type of fundraising enabled by blockchain technology is exciting, but has also drawn quite a bit of skepticism, partly because dubious projects have been able to raise millions of dollars in this way.  In order to pursue their private-public blockchain, to be used for more than just energy use cases, Lition plans to launch their own ICO to get it off the ground later this year.

In its financial stability report for 2018, released on Friday, the PBoC said that ""disguised"" initial coin offerings (ICOs) including airdrops continue to grow in number, despite its previous efforts at cracking down on sales of tokens. For instance, it said, some crypto firms are moving their projects overseas and using agents to invest on behalf of investors from China.  Other projects are not issuing tokens in public to directly raise funds, but are rather giving away free tokens while reserving a part of the total supply. These firms then try to use speculation in the secondary market to jack up these tokens' prices in order to reap profits, the bank added.  Giving the statistics, the bank said, there were 65 completed ICOs in China up until July 18, 2017, only five of which were completed prior to 2017. Further, it adds, over 105,000 people participated in the sales, providing total funding of about 2.6 billion yuan ($377.3 million), accounting for more than 20 percent of the sum raised globally in the same period.  The central bank said that it needs to remain highly vigilant and to coordinate with other agencies to monitor the crypto industry in order to educate and protect investors.  The PBoC has been taking measures against to block token fundraising since September 2017, when it outright banned ICOs. In June of this year, a vice governor of the PBoC issued strong statements against ""disguised"" ICOs and restated that crypto asset trading is illegal in the country.
