42405743,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeoPHJ,1611441904,Early CryptoPunk Digital Collectible Sells for $762K in Ether,"Some rudimentary pixel art just sold for 605 ETH, or $761,889 at purchase.      FlamingoDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for investing in digital collectibles, is behind Saturday’s eye-popping CryptoPunk sale. Only nine such “Alien” punks exist in the CryptoPunks universe, which pioneered non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in 2017 and are the “Holy Grail” for an emerging class of Ethereum-based art collectors.      FlamingoDAO community representative Priyanka Desai told CoinDesk it was by far the collective’s most expensive piece to date.      “I showed my mom and she was like, ‘What???’” Desai said in a phone interview.      Flamingo is a fund with roughly 40 members and 4,800 ETH in pooled capital, Desai said. It has “hundreds” of NFTs in its growing collection including rare Autoglyphs, NBA Top Shot cards and land plots in various metaverses.      Flamingo’s decision to act on this rare opportunity “was whipped together within 25 minutes,” mostly via Discord, Desai said. CryptoPunk 2890 was put up for sale by its unknown owner early Saturday morning UTC.      “It’s understandable for folks to be skeptical about NFTs, but in our view, NFTs are the future of not just digital art, but all digital property,” FlamingoDAO said in a statement. “It’s the tip of a very large spear.”      A prominent decentralized finance (DeFi) personality, @0x_b1, was one of the counterbidders who lost out on CryptoPunk 2890. In a tweet, @0x_b1 said they had valued the NFT at roughly $1 million.      The CryptoPunk in question last sold in July 2017 for 8 ETH, or $2,127 at the time. That represents a 75x return on investment in ETH terms (and even greater in U.S. dollars).      “People see it as a collectible that is pretty significant in the history of NFTs,” said Desai.      For the seller, whose wallet holds 301 CryptoPunks in all, there is another offer on the table from the group led by @0x_b1. Though it's not listed for sale, a fellow Alien (CryptoPunk 3100) has a bid for 666 ETH, or roughly $875,000.    Read more: The Inevitable Marriage of Yield Farming and NFTs, Explained    Options for realizing a return on Flamingo’s new investment are still to be determined by DAO members, Desai said. Aside from future appreciation or its possible financialization, “There’s also this notion of Flamingo wanting to build galleries in different metaverses for putting this and other pieces on display,” she said.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | ZRX,Zack Seward,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/01/23/early-cryptopunk-digital-collectible-sells-for-762k-in-ether,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f82d42f335a1b9a7dc97cdc8c4106d49e202207c-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405747,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeoPLF,1611418632,Valkyrie Digital Assets Files for Bitcoin ETF,"Valkyrie Digital Assets filed an application on Friday for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the second such filing in the last 30 days.      The Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund would be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC, would serve as the custodian for the proposed ETF, according to Dallas-registered Valkyrie Investments, the parent of Valkyrie Digital Assets.      Leah Wald, CEO of Valkyrie Investments, told CoinDesk, ""Our executive team has previously launched multiple ETFs, publicly traded funds and ETPs [exchange-traded products], including bitcoin funds.""      Wald said the team behind the ETF includes ""Steven McClurg and John Key, who have collectively worked on over 100 esoteric and novel deals that have passed regulatory scrutiny.""      At the end of December, VanEck re-submitted an application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a VanEck Bitcoin Trust ETF.      While an ETF is seen as advantageous because it trades on the stock market in much the same way as shares in popular companies such as Apple and Microsoft, over the years the SEC has rejected bitcoin ETF proposals due to concerns about market volatility and industry manipulation.      In August 2018, it rejected nine such proposals on the same day.      Read more: The Case for a Bitcoin ETF      Still, there've been signs the SEC is warming to the idea. In October 2020, then-Chairman Jay Clayton, who many saw as lukewarm toward crypto, said the agency was still open to considering ETF proposals.      Now, with a new administration causing a changing of the guard at the SEC, it is widely hoped by crypto advocates that such an ETF will be approved in 2021. Clayton stepped down officially last month and is expected to be replaced by Gary Gensler, who is widely seen as being more pro-crypto than is his predecessor.      Also adding to optimism is this month's departure of Dalia Blass, the director of the SEC's division of investment management. Blass was the author of a 2018 letter within the SEC expressing concerns the bitcoin market was not large enough or liquid enough to be ready for an exchange-traded product.
