42398683,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgMNR,1443132446,World Economic Forum Survey Projects Blockchain 'Tipping Point' by 2023,"The World Economic Forum (WEF) has identified blockchain technology as one of its six mega-trends in a new report broadly aimed at outlining the expected transition to a more digital and connected world.  Compiled by the WEF's Global Agenda Council on the Future of Software and Society, the report included the results of a survey of more than 800 information and communications executives and experts. Perhaps most notable among the poll's findings is that those surveyed believe the ""tipping point"" for government use of the blockchain will occur by 2023.  For purposes of the survey, blockchain technology was broadly defined as ""an emerging technology [that] replaces the need for third-party institutions to provide trust for financial, contract and voting activities"".  In turn, the survey suggested bitcoin and the blockchain would reach a ""tipping point"", or a point at which it becomes broadly adopted, by 2027. Respondents were given a range of potential responses to survey questions, which included the ability to respond with answers such as ""it has already happened"", it will happen in ""20+ years"" or it will ""never"" happen.  Of the respondents, 73.1% reported by that taxes would first be collected using a blockchain by 2025, while 57.9% affirmed they believe 10% of global gross domestic product (GDP) would be stored on a blockchain by this time. By comparison, 91.2% of survey-takers indicated 10% of people would wear clothes connected to the Internet by that year.  The WEF also indicated that, should blockchain technology become mainstream, it would be likely that the traditional role of government and institutions would need to be reimagined, writing:  ""Economic and monetary management will be overhauled by new systems anchored in digital currencies and the blockchain, making traditional pricing mechanisms and exchange rate systems less relevant.""  Founded in 1971, the WEF is a 600-person independent international organization dedicated to improving the world through collaborations between the public and private sector. As part of its mandate, it holds an annual meeting on politics, economics and social issues.  Bitcoin and the blockchain  While 58% of survey-takers expect bitcoin and the blockchain to hit mainstream, accounting for 10% of global GDP, by 2025, WEF forecasted the expected date as 2027.  ""Currently, the total worth of bitcoin in the blockchain is around $20bn, or about 0.025% of global GDP of around $80tn,"" the report read.  The report went on to list the positive benefits of such a transition, which included:  An explosion in tradable assets, as all kinds of value exchange can be hosted on the blockchain  Better property records in emerging markets, and the ability to make everything a tradable asset  Contacts and legal services increasingly tied to code linked to the blockchain, to be used as unbreakable escrow or programmatically designed smart contracts  Disintermediation of financial institutions, as new services and value exchanges are created directly on the blockchain  Increased financial inclusion in emerging markets, as financial services on the blockchain gain critical mass  Increased transparency, as the blockchain is essentially a global ledger storing all transactions.  Smart contracts were further used as an example of the technology, as the report described how the the blockchain can allow two parties to create complex contracts without a middleman.  The process of creating ""self-executing contractual states"", it continued, could eliminate the risk that comes from a reliance on third parties.  Governments and the blockchain  The WEF notably projected that governments would begin leveraging the blockchain sooner than the mainstream public, with this expected transition occurring by 2023.  By 2025, 73% of respondents expected this to occur.  ""The blockchain creates both opportunities and challenges for countries,"" the report read. ""On the one hand, it is unregulated and not overseen by any central bank, meaning less control over monetary policy. On the other hand, it creates the ability for new taxing mechanisms to be built into the blockchain itself (eg a small transaction tax).""  The report suggested there were potential drawbacks to blockchain-based government systems, including an undermining of central bank and monetary policy, corruption, real-time taxation and changes to the role of government.  Of note is that government experiments with blockchain technology are already underway, with the Isle of Man's Department of Economic Development announcing plans for a trial in May.

According to court documents, Arthur Budovsky asked the judge to waive the indictment on multiple grounds in June, raising questions about whether the firm, based in Costa Rica, was required to register as a money services businesses and whether bitcoin qualifies as ""funds"".  US District Judge Denise Cote of the Southern District of New York rejected Budovsky's motion, which will set the stage for Budovsky to head to trial.  Budovsky was arrested in May 2013 and charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmission business and the operation of an unlicensed money transmission business.  Liberty Reserve was a payment network that allowed users to exchange a digital currency called LR. The federal government has said that Liberty Reserve enabled billions of dollars in funds to be transferred worldwide without mandated controls or identification protocols.  The company has since featured prominently in discussions regarding bitcoin regarding, especially by law enforcement officials.  Other former employees of Liberty Reserve, including one of its co-founders and its IT manager, have plead guilty to similar charges.

42398689,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgMSM,1443120932,BitFury Reveals New Details About $100 Million Bitcoin Mine,"BitFury will invest $100m in building a 100MW bitcoin mining data centre in Georgia, according to a new report by local news source Agenda.  To be built in the country's capital city of Tbilisi, the data centre will be the bitcoin transaction processor's second in the Eurasian nation, complementing a 20MW data centre based in Gori.  The data centre was first announced in July, following the news BitFury had raised $20m in venture capital to both build the facility and complete a roll out of its 28nm bitcoin mining ASIC. While construction of the facility began in early August, the company did not specify whether the $100m would be invested wholly in construction or if this figure would also include operational costs.  The data centre will be built on 185,000 square metres of land set aside by the Georgian National Agency of State Property to create a ""special technology zone"" with the goal of attracting international technology firms, the news source said.  In statements, BitFury's official representative in Georgia, Eprem Urumashvili, expanded on the benefits he believes the data centre will provide as part of this effort.  Urumashvili said:  ""Georgia will have three main benefits – a $100m USD investment, to bring modern information technologies into the country and to be added to the innovative technologies world map.""  According to the report, the data centre will house bitcoin miners containing BitFury's 28nm and soon-to-be-released 16nm ASIC chips. BitFury announced in September that it had completed the tape-out for the 16nm chips, which achieve energy efficiency of 0.06 joules per gigahash.  BitFury had previously suggested its 16nm chips could be deployed in a new data centre in North America, though it is not clear if this announcement will impact this potential plan.  However, the move may not be surprising as the company has local ties to Georgia.  Notably, CEO Valery Vavilov has indicated that the head of BitFury's data centre construction department owns his own firm in Georgia. Further, the Georgian Co-Investment Fund, an investment firm dedicated to strategic funding in the region, has also participated in all three of BitFury's $20m venture rounds.  BitFury did not immediately respond to requests for further information.

42398681,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgMLT,1443115049,CFTC Reaches Settlement With Bitcoin Swaps Shop TeraExchange,"The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has settled charges it filed today against New Jersey-based bitcoin swap execution facility (SEF) TeraExchange.  The charges  stem from a non-deliverable forward contract executed on 8th October on TeraExchange, which is provisionally registered as a SEF. The transaction took place under the active guidance of TeraExchange, without any associated trading fees or collateral requirements, the agency said.  According to the CFTC, these actions constitute wash trading and prearranged trading in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act.  The agency defines wash trading as the act of ""entering into, or purporting to enter into, transactions to give the appearance that purchases and sales have been made, without incurring market risk or changing the trader's market position"".  Prearranged trading constitutes an act of ""trading between brokers in accordance with an expressed or implied agreement or understanding"", according to the CFTC.  Press materials from the time indicate that one of the parties was Australian bitcoin mining firm DigitalBTC, whereas the other was an unidentified ""hedging counterparty"".  The exchange facilitated the prearranged transaction and then went on to ""[create] the impression of actual trading interest in the bitcoin swap"" in a 9th October press release,"" according to the CFTC.  ""Neither Tera's press release nor the statements at the Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) meeting indicated that the October 8 transactions were pre-arranged wash sales executed for the purpose of testing Tera’s systems,” the agency said in a press release.  This, the agency said, was different from a situation in which an exchange would openly declare that it was testing its systems, stating in its order:  ""These facts should be distinguished from a situation where a SEF or other designated contract market runs pre-operational test trades to confirm that its systems are technically capable of executing transactions and, to the extent that these simulated transactions become publicly known, makes it clear to the public that the trades do not represent actual liquidity in the subject market.""  The CFTC has ordered TeraExchange to refrain from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. No monetary penalty was levied against the company.  The move comes shortly after the CFTC settled charges against bitcoin options trading platform Coinflip. In that same ruling, the agency stated that, under its interpretation of the law, bitcoin and digital currencies are commodities.  TeraExchange did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  This article has been updated with additional information about the settlement.

42398676,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgMHX,1443095848,Naughty America Reintegrates Bitcoin Payments After Hiatus,"UPDATE (26th September 11:03 BST): Naughty America CEO Andreas Hronopoulos has clarified why bitcoin was reintroduced to the site, citing a boom in demand following its virtual reality products. Read his comments in full here.      Adult entertainment provider Naughty America is once again accepting bitcoin, after the currency vanished from its checkout over a year ago.  The payment option's reappearance was uncovered by Reddit user Logical007 early this morning. The company has so far been quiet on both the return and its timing.  As before, Naughty America – which operates a network of 45 sites – is accepting payment through merchant processor BitPay. However, one month's subscription in the currency is $29.95 – 20% higher than Naughty America's credit card option. Annually, bitcoin users would pay over $48 more than those paying by card.  Killer app?  The currency gained traction early last year with a number of adult entertainment sites, including Playboy Plus, Hustler and Porn.com, adding support for membership and premium access.  ""I think it will become an industry-wide thing within 45 to 60 days ... Naughty America really sets the bar for where the industry heads,"" CEO Andreas Hronopoulos told CoinDesk at the time.  While pundits have suggested porn could be bitcoin's 'killer app', the news comes at a lull in the industry. MindGeek – the company behind some of the adult industry's highest trafficked sites including YouPorn and PornHub – has yet to roll out bitcoin beyond Playboy Plus and a brief trial on IKnowThatGirl.com.  Sales are also slowing, in line with the majority of bitcoin-accepting brands. For example Porn.com said an initial 50% surge in sales had tapered off to 10% by the following month. Bitcoin's tech-savvy demographic might be on board, but it appears mainstream consumers still don't see a compelling reason to use the currency.  MindGeek had not responded to requests for comment at the time of publication.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC,Grace Caffyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/09/24/naughty-america-reintegrates-bitcoin-payments-after-hiatus,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e33dae313b3e5bbacd5bf4cc0d60207ba3cfbbe1-1500x978.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
