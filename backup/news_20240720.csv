31288302,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630749,1721514610,Is $200 Within Reach For Solana Price? Here’s Why This Blockchain Firm Thinks So,"Like the general crypto market, the price of Solana (SOL) witnessed significant growth over the past week. According to the latest on-chain data, this might only be the beginning for SOL’s price, with several indications of further upside potential for the altcoin. What’s Behind Solana’s Recent Price Climb? In a new report, blockchain intelligence firm Santiment offered insight into the recent price of Solana. According to the analytics platform, the price of SOL has swung upward by more than 33% since the 4th of July, rewarding investors who continued to bet big on it despite the sluggish market conditions. Related Reading: Crypto Market Rebounds From Lows, But Why Are Cardano Holders Suffering Losses? Santiment mentioned that this positive run of form displayed by the altcoin over the past two weeks can be linked to investor sentiment. The blockchain firm noted that the price climb was triggered and sustained by crowd doubt. Typically, the cryptocurrency market and asset prices tend to move in the opposite direction of the crowd. Hence, when there is euphoria and excitement amongst investors, assets tend to fall in value. Meanwhile, asset prices are likely to increase when there is crowd disbelief or FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt). Despite the sustained increase in Solana’s value, there is yet to be a shift in investor sentiment — which is currently negative. This on-chain observation is based on Santiment’s weighted sentiment metric, which measures the overall positive and negative sentiment toward a cryptocurrency. Furthermore, with the continued negative sentiment towards Solana, Santiment believes that the token’s price could experience a further rise this weekend. “Until FOMO replaces the FUD, $200 SOL is very much reachable soon,” the on-chain analytics platform revealed. Solana Price To $200? A return to $200 would be a highly exciting move for the Solana price, having faced rejection around the zone back in mid-March and early April. However, it is a feat that would take at least a 20% increase from the current price point. 📈 The Solana faithful have been rewarded for their patience as prices have broken out +33% since the 4th of July. The climb is being fueled by crowd doubt toward SOL. Until FOMO replaces the FUD, $200 SOL is very much reachable soon. pic.twitter.com/hLpf8qZVqb — Santiment (@santimentfeed) July 19, 2024 Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Drops 10% As 5 Trillion SHIB Flood To Exchanges Following WazirX’s Exploit As of this writing, the price of Solana appears to be currently facing resistance around the $170 mark, although it is up by nearly 4% in the last 24 hours.

31283921,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630706,1721507455,Bitcoin Option Traders Are Betting On A Price Breakout Ahead Of US Elections: QCP Capital,"The price of Bitcoin has been on a tear over the past seven days, returning between the $61,000 and $67,000 zone where it spent most of the second quarter. This positive run of form comes despite the FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) due to speculations about Mt. Gox’s customer repayment. Interestingly, recent trading data have led QCP Capital, a prominent trading data, to suggest that Bitcoin might only be warming up for an even bigger price rally. According to the company’s analysts, the premier cryptocurrency looks primed for significant price growth ahead of the United States elections. BTC Price To Reach $100,000 By Year End? Unsurprisingly, the climb of the Bitcoin price from beneath $60,000 to as high as $67,000 in the past week has been one of the hottest topics of discussion amongst investors. Analysts at QCP Capital are amongst the latest set of experts to weigh in on the recent price action of the market leader. Related Reading: Buying ‘Ethereum Beta’ Altcoins Is A Recipe For Disaster, Researcher Finds According to the QCP analysts, the resilient upward movement of the BTC price reflects how the market may have “shaken off” most of its concerns. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency may be preparing to continue its bull run, having spent the better parts of the last quarter in consolidation. The QCP analysts pointed out in the report that the perpetual funding rate is back to a neutral position, signaling a balanced sentiment amongst traders. For context, the funding rate refers to a periodic payment exchanged between buyers and sellers in perpetual futures contracts. What’s more, QCP capital noted that the Bitcoin spot market could persist within the $61,000 – $67,000 range in the short term, especially with traders holding substantial long positions at the July 26 $67,000 strike. Ultimately, investors appear to be betting big on a price upswing ahead of the United States elections. Additionally, there has been steady and significant institutional interest in December $100,000 calls. This suggests an increasing confidence in the potential of a year-end rally for Bitcoin, especially with the rising odds of a Donald Trump victory in the upcoming elections. It is worth mentioning that the price of Bitcoin spiked following the assassination attempt on the former United States president. This price movement was linked to the increased odds of a win for Donald Trump, who has been a vocal supporter of the premier cryptocurrency in recent months. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin continues to hover around $66,660, reflecting an over 5% increase in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, BTC is up by more than 16% in the past week.

31278134,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630709,1721498429,Here’s What To Know On Grayscale Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF Spinoffs – Details,"Prominent asset manager Grayscale Investments is set to launch spinoffs of their Grayscale Ethereum Trust’s (ETHE) and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) exchange-traded funds (ETF). Following inquiries by market spectators and potential investors, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart has provided much insight into the nature and operation of these spinoffs. Grayscale ETF Spinoff Based On 90-10% Sharing Format, Seyffart Says On Friday, James Seyffart published a thread on social media platform X, discussing vital information about Grayscale’s ETF spin-offs Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH) and Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), which are based on the company’s ETHE and GBTC’s funds respectively. Related Reading: BlackRock Overtakes Grayscale To Become The Largest Bitcoin Fund In The World With $20 Billion AUM An ETF spinoff occurs when a portion of an ETF’s holdings is separated into a new, independent ETF. In this process, shareholders of the original ETF, i.e. EHTE and GBTC, automatically receive shares of the new ETF, i.e. ETH and BTC. However, the amount each shareholder receives is proportional to their holdings in the original ETF and the sharing formula of the spinoff. Seyffart explains that Grayscale spinoffs are based on the same mechanics, whereby if you have 1000 shares of ETHE or GBTC, you will receive 1000 shares of ETH or BTC. Nevertheless, in terms of value, Seyffart states that an initial $1000 worth of ETHE or GBTC will decrease to $900, while the shares in the new ETFs accumulate a value of $100, implying that Grayscale is employing a 90-10% sharing formula. Furthermore, the Bloomberg analyst highlighted that the spinoff for ETHE is programmed for July 23, while that of GBTC will occur on July 31. However, to be eligible for share distributions from the new ETFs, investors should have purchased shares in these original funds before or on the record dates for these spin-offs, which are July 18th for ETHE and July 30 for BTC. Thereafter, investors will have to purchase shares of ETH as a separate, independent fund. Seyffart notes the record date for ETHE is already past, stating the low price of the ETF at the start of trading was due to the spinoff process on that day. The analyst warns investors to anticipate a similar fate for GBTC on July 30. Importance Of Grayscale’s ETF Spinoffs Spinoffs are generally conducted for various reasons but with the aim of satisfying a more focused demand. According to Grayscale, their latest spinoffs aim to offer investors the choice of buying a similar product but at lower fees. For context, the proposed ETH spin-off will be accompanied by a sponsor fee of only 0.15% which is quite low in comparison to ETHE’s 2.5% fee.

The analyst has shared several factors that could propel Bitcoin to this lofty price target. Bitcoin To Hit $100,000 In 2024 On July 19, crypto analyst Scott Melker, also known as “The Wolf Of All Streets” on X (formerly Twitter), informed his 958,300 followers that he was extremely bullish on Bitcoin’s potential for a future price increase. The analyst emphasized his long term optimistic stance and investment on Bitcoin, highlighting that this bias keeps him generally bullish on the cryptocurrency’s price outlook. Related Reading: Can Burns Send The Shiba Inu And LUNC Price To $0.01? Expert Chimes In According to Melker, Bitcoin’s current market cycle was uniquely different from others. He revealed that in past cycles, the market was swung between overly pessimistic and overly optimistic narratives. However in the current market conditions, mostly positive and tangible narratives about Bitcoin are coming true. Melker also highlighted several factors that will contribute to Bitcoin’s bullish surge, predicting that BTC will reach $100,000 before the end of 2024. Considering Bitcoin’s price sits at $66,523 as of writing, this will require a 50.34% increase. Although the crypto analyst acknowledged that a rise to $100,000 seems ambitious, he also believes that if the right conditions are met during the later stages of the bull market, Bitcoin could achieve this substantial price increase in the blink of an eye. During his post, Melker urged crypto community members to “think bigger,” possibly suggesting that investors should stay bullish and expect more from Bitcoin in the bull market. Biggest Factors Driving Bitcoin’s Bullish Surge While forecasting Bitcoin’s surge to $100,000 before the year’s end, Melker compiled a long list of some of the biggest factors that could propel Bitcoin higher. The analyst highlighted the possibility for Spot Bitcoin ETFs to fuel a price surge in Bitcoin. He revealed that as more inflows enter into Spot Bitcoin ETFs, it could create a steady stream of upward price pressure for Bitcoin. Melker also revealed that if former United States (US) President, Donald Trump wins the upcoming Presidential elections, it may push wealthy fund managers like Vanguard and Wells Fargo to enter the Spot Bitcoin ETFs market. This shift could result in up to $40 billion in inflows by the end of 2024. Related Reading: Crypto Market Rebounds From Lows, But Why Are Cardano Holders Suffering Losses? The crypto analyst also emphasized that Ethereum Spot ETFs were another major factor that could propel Bitcoin’s price increase. He noted that the appeal of diversifying into an asset class other than Spot Bitcoin ETFs might drive up the price of Ethereum. He also highlighted that Ethereum’s success following the launch of its ETF will determine the pace at which new crypto ETF filings like Solana ETFs will emerge. Furthermore, Melker pointed out that the upcoming Bitcoin conference, the expansion of tokenization and Real World Assets (RWAs) and the evolutionary innovative changes in stablecoins are significant drivers behind Bitcoin’s bullish surge. Melker also noted that if Trump wins the US presidential elections and delivers on his promises, it could ease the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) anti-crypto stance and aggressive enforcement tactics on the industry. This would also ultimately provide more clarity of regulatory frameworks and jurisdictions for the crypto space.

31268860,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630721,1721484014,Solana Sets Sights On $175 Resistance As Bullish Momentum Builds,"Lately, the price of Solana (SOL) has been demonstrating bullish resilience and gaining significant growth above its bearish trendline. Market participants are closely watching this current price action with the $175 resistance acting as a pivotal point, and a break above it could set the stage for a potential rally that might propel the crypto asset towards the $175 mark. As bullish sentiment around SOL continues to build, this article seeks to analyze its current price movements above the bearish trendline and the technical indicators suggesting sustained growth. The goal is to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of SOL’s potential future trajectory. SOL’s price was trading at approximately $169 and was up by 5.12% with a market capitalization of over $78 billion and a trading volume of over $3.5 billion as of the time of writing. In the last 24 hours, the asset’s market cap has increased by 5.21%, while its trading volume has increased by 69.07%. Solana Eyes The $175 Mark On the 4-hour chart, after breaking above the bearish trendline, SOL has continued to maintain its bullish momentum, trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This sustained momentum could potentially set up a move toward the $175 mark. The 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator confirms that SOL could continue its bullish trajectory above the trendline, as both the signal line and the SMA of the indicator are currently trending in the overbought zone. Also, the signal line shows no sign of crossing below the SMA. On the 1-day chart, following the breakthrough, Solana is currently attempting a single candle bullish move toward the $175 resistance mark, trading above the 100-day SMA. This bullish momentum could potentially drive the digital asset to reach the $175 mark. Lastly, it can be observed that the signal line has crossed above the SMA of the indicator and has crossed above the zero line, with both lines attempting to move toward the overbought zone. This formation of the composite trend oscillator suggests that SOL’s price may continue its current bullish move above the trendline toward the $175 resistance. The Implications Of SOL’s Bullish Breakout The current price action suggests that Solana is on the verge of igniting a bullish move above the trendline toward the $175 resistance mark. If the coin achieves this level and breaks above, it could lead to a further climb toward the $188 mark. When this level is breached, the digital asset may experience a price increase toward the $205 resistance level and possibly other levels above. However, if Solana fails to break above the $175 resistance mark, it may start a fresh decline toward the $160 support level. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency could experience additional price drops, potentially challenging the $118 support range and possibly lower levels if this support is breached.

31266623,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4705277-fidelitys-fbtc-the-pick-and-shovel-etf-for-bitcoin-exposure?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1721480400,FBTC: The Pick And Shovel ETF For Bitcoin Exposure,"Summary Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen impressive inflows and institutional investments since launch, with daily inflows majorly outpacing the total daily produced BTC on the Bitcoin network since the halving. Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF stands out with experience in crypto-focused products, self-custody, low expense ratio, and strong infrastructure for Bitcoin investing. FBTC is emerging as a leader in inflows among spot Bitcoin ETFs, as its low fees, decent liquidity and high on-chain BTC balance attract ample investments into the fund. Recent volatility in the Bitcoin market, fueled by the German government sell-off and the Mt. Gox repayments, may impact spot Bitcoin ETFs like FBTC, but the long-term bullish case remains. The spot Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETFs, since their launch on January 10 have so far recorded very impressive inflows. The ETFs have also seen some “bad” weeks with negative net flows. Typically when Bitcoin sees a retrace, the ETFs see more outflows. The spot Bitcoin ETFs have provided a proxy for gaining exposure to Bitcoin without needing to worry about intricacies like custody of Bitcoin and Bitcoin network fees. Among the approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ) is one of my favorite spot Bitcoin ETFs. Reasons include the fund’s experience in launching crypto-focused products (being active in crypto since 2014), its self-custody (unlike other ETFs that opt for a third-party asset custodian), its attractive 0.25% expense ratio, and the six-month initial expense ratio waiver. Fidelity’s all-around infrastructure surrounding Bitcoin and other crypto-assets makes FBTC a potential institutional pick and shovel for Bitcoin investing. Fidelity's robust range of investment, trading, retirement, and wealth management platforms and packages, which includes Fidelity Crypto and Individual Retirement Account (“IRA”) packages, positions the issuer to become a go-to platform for offerings such as including Bitcoin in IRAs, now that a traditional vehicle to access crypto has been approved. While some detractors believe digital assets won't be included in IRAs, I, however, believe that at this stage, it would be ill-advised to bet against BTC. Bitcoin has come a long way as an asset class, from an emerging technology just over a decade ago to becoming mainstream today. Excerpt from my January FBTC article. As FBTC closely tracks Bitcoin’s spot price, the success of FBTC is mostly linked to Bitcoin’s success. This begs the question, where is Bitcoin (and its spot ETFs) likely headed, following the recent volatility? Bitcoin FUD: ETFs Face Volatility Volatility is inherent to the crypto market. Being an open 24/7 market with ubiquitous access and no market open or close times, the crypto market reacts to news on the go (in real-time). Instances like the September 2017 China crypto trade ban , saw BTC drop by around 40% from its monthly $5,000 high. The FUD soon blew over and BTC went on to hit an all-time high price of around $19,000 in December 2017 - just three months after the China ban FUD had driven the price down. Similar FUDs have followed, for which a “Bitcoin obituary” was prematurely declared; Bitcoin, however, has consistently bounced back, breaking a new all-time high price. The top 80 holders of spot ETFs are institutions, according to SEC filings (Bitcoin Magazine) The difference between the past Bitcoin era (like the 2017 scenario I previously described) and the current era is that there is more organic demand for Bitcoin from institutional investors via the spot Bitcoin ETFs. Data show the top 80 holders of the Bitcoin ETFs are institutional investors. Despite the recent FUD fueled by the sale of BTC by the German government (the FUD seems to have waned further since the start of this week), I believe that the post-halving bullish case (new supply reduction) for Bitcoin is still in play. This is evident in the $1.04 billion inflows the spot ETFs recorded last week, which followed the swift rebound Bitcoin witnessed from the over 15% dip and now trading strongly above the $60,000 psychological level. Now that the German government is out of BTC to sell, (according to on-chain data ), Bitcoin investors are speculating a similar selling pressure from the Mt. Gox repayment. For readers who are not familiar with the Mt. Gox story, Mt. Gox, an initialism for ""Magic: The Gathering Online eXchange.” was a Japan-based crypto exchange and the largest crypto exchange in its prime (2011 to 2014). The crypto market was a nascent and fledgling industry at that time, and Mt. Gox faced several security breaches, with one of the most prominent cases of such breach in 2011 when 25,000 BTC were stolen from Mt. Gox users’ accounts. The biggest breach took place in February 2014 during which 850,000 BTC were stolen from the exchange. Forcing the exchange to shut down and file for bankruptcy. 200,000 BTC of Mt. Gox funds were later found in one of the exchange’s old wallets, and that propelled the repayment hopes. A decade later, Mt. Gox is finally set to commence repayments to creditors after a lengthy process between the creditors and the Mt. Gox trustee. Mt. Gox will reimburse 140,000 BTC, currently valued at around $9 billion, to its creditors. Mt. Gox moved 44,526.95 BTC worth about $2.8 billion to a cold wallet on Tuesday (seen in on-chain data ), after initially sending over what appears to be a 0.02 BTC test transaction into the same cold wallet - a precursor to the payouts. The payouts to creditors will be facilitated through major crypto exchanges, including Bitstamp and Kraken. While fears of a sell-off and another price crash linger, one key difference I have noticed between the recent BTC sell-off by the German government and the Mt. Gox payouts is that the former was sudden and occurred without prior public knowledge, while that of Mt. Gox is already anticipated with the market bracing for impact. The market may have absorbed some of the FUD already. Also, the exchanges that will distribute the repayments or creditors have up to 60 to 90 days to plan and distribute the payments. Hence, the repayments would likely not be a case of funds distributed simultaneously and dumped on the market abruptly. However, I'm not ruling out some volatility once the payouts roll out fully. This volatility could spill over to FBTC and other spot Bitcoin ETFs. Risks Volatility risk remains one of the main risks associated with BTC and ETFs like FBTC. I'm, however, confident that the current dust created by the German sell-off and Mt. Gox repayments will settle very quickly. I take this stance mainly because of increased demands for the spot ETFs which have outpaced new BTC creation. Based on the 3.125 BTC block reward since the fourth halving in April and an average block time of 10 minutes, about 450 BTC are created daily on the Bitcoin network. At the current market price of around $65,000, the 450 daily produced BTC is around $29 million. On weeks with healthy inflows, the spot Bitcoin ETFs average over $100 million of daily inflows. This is the main basis for my confidence in Bitcoin beating the FUD and maintaining momentum moving forward. Direct custody of Bitcoin exposes investors to asset loss risks for which the investor will be fully liable. An ETF like FBTC provides some cushion and mitigates this risk by handling asset custody within the fund. This, however, doesn't completely rule out the risk of hacking or theft of the fund's cold wallets. Such an occurrence will adversely affect the ETF's net asset value. Investor Takeaway Many a Bitcoin maxi still downplays the importance or usefulness of the spot ETFs in the Bitcoin ecosystem. They tout the direct ownership and self-custody of Bitcoin as the only viable option. Just like some investors prefer gold ETFs over directly owning physical gold bars or gold mining stocks due to simplicity and liquidity, those interested in Bitcoin may opt for ETFs instead of worrying about the intricacies of cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges. Not every investor is interested in the intricacies and the techy aspects of Bitcoin, so some may prefer ETFs instead. Among the ETFs, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF possesses the stand-out features, in my view, comprising experience in managing crypto-focused products, competitive expense ratio, and healthy inflows and trade volumes. theblock.co At the inception of the ETFs, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) led the inflows. FBTC has since played serious catch-up with IBIT and now leads inflows more often. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) continues to see outflows and a decline in its AuM due to its high 1.5% fee. FBTC's fee, after the initial fee waiver until August 1, remains competitive at 25 bps. This isn't the lowest fee among the spot ETFs - Franklin Templeton Digital Holdings Trust ( EZBC ) has a 0.19% fee, Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ) and VanEck Bitcoin Trust ( HODL ) fees are 0.2%, and Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ) has a 0.21% fee. However, FBTC’s combination of decent and consistent volume and inflows has made it a top pick among the ETFs. GBTC still commands the highest volume but has been plagued by consistent outflows due to its 1.5%. IBIT also commands significant volume. theblock.co theblock.co Where FBTC stands out the most has been in its on-chain BTC holding. Since the launch of the spot ETFs, FBTC's on-chain Bitcoin holding has consistently surpassed its cash holding. Thus FBTC provides the best direct exposure to Bitcoin among the spot ETFs, in my view, evident in its proportionally higher allocation to BTC. The post-halving bullish case for Bitcoin is still in play and demand for BTC is catalyzed by the strong demand for the spot ETFs. Bitcoin is entering a bull market and FBTC’s higher exposure to Bitcoin means that it is in a good position to potentially trade at a higher premium to NAV in a full-blown Bitcoin bull market, among the spot Bitcoin ETFs. FBTC currently trades at a 0.21% premium to NAV, which is 25 basis points lower than IBIT's 0.46% premium. As a long-term crypto investor, Bitcoin is an asset I won't bet against at this point. Bitcoin has become one of the campaign points of the coming U.S. elections, with the Republican Candidate set to give a keynote speech at the upcoming edition of the Bitcoin Conference dubbed Bitcoin 2024. Bitcoin is now mainstream! I have a stronger case to recommend a “buy” for FBTC. I anticipated some “sell the news” sentiment after the ETF creation, coupled with the post-halving volatility; hence, I recommended a “hold” in my previous coverage in January. FBTC is up about 54% since that coverage. There is a strong bullish case for Bitcoin at this point and more upside for FBTC. Long FBTC!

31264290,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630700,1721476829,Stalled USDT Liquidity Threatens Bitcoin Price Further Growth – Here’s Why,"The price of Bitcoin has maintained a recovery trajectory over the last week, gaining by a significant 16.25% to move briefly above the $67,000 price mark. Bitcoin investors are likely hopeful the asset will record more price gains and finally embark on a bull run following the halving event in April. However, Bitcoin’s price future gains are theorized to be tied to multiple factors including the liquidity of the stablecoin market. Why A Stagant USDT Liquidity Is Harmful To Bitcoin? In an X post on Friday, prominent on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant emphasized the importance of stablecoin liquidity to an appreciation in Bitcoin’s price. CryptoQuant stated that for premier cryptocurrency to experience further price increases, there is a need for an equal rise in the stablecoin market shares. Related Reading: Coinbase Analysts Warn: Bitcoin’s Upward Trend Could Hit a Wall — Here’s Why For context, stablecoins refer to a type of cryptocurrency with a fixed value that is usually pegged to a reserve asset, usually the US dollar. These assets are combined valued at $163.56 billion and are critical to digital asset adoption for users with a fear of market volatility. In relation to Bitcoin’s price, CryptoQuant specifically references Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin and third largest cryptocurrency with a market cap value of $113.78 billion, as a major influencing factor. The analytics team explains that USDT’s growth in the last month has been near 0% (1.03%), thus suggesting a slight 3.21% increase in Bitcoin’s price over the same period. In contrast, USDT’s market shares grew by 6.6% in March 2024, the same time in which Bitcoin rose from $61,168 to secure a new all-time high at $73,750. The relationship between both assets could stem from the prominent use of USDT in crypto trading. Thus, a higher level of USDT liquidity could allow traders to increase demand for risky assets, including Bitcoin. According to CryptoQuant, the Bitcoin market, therefore, requires a rapid rise in stablecoin liquidity to maintain its current positive price performance.

Analyst Highlights “Dangerous” BTC Price Level In other news, amidst Bitcoin’s current price rally, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez has warned that Bitcoin must maintain its price above the $66,385 level to avoid a massive liquidation of about $42.67 million. At the time of writing, Bitcoin continues to trade at $66,571 with a notable 4.65% gain in the last day. In a similar fashion, the asset’s daily trading volume is up by 38.08% and valued at $37.2 billion.

CBOE Finalizes Launch Date For Spot Ethereum ETFs On July 19, the CBOE released a new issue notification on its official website concerning the launch of Spot Ethereum ETFs trading. According to the notification, five Spot ETH ETFs will begin trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange on July 23, 2024, pending regulatory effectiveness. Previously, analysts, including Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, had predicted that Spot ETH ETFs could start trading on July 2. However, Balchunas has since revised his forecast, suggesting in another X (formerly Twitter) post that ETH ETFs would likely launch on July 18. Related Reading: Crypto Market Rebounds From Lows, But Why Are Cardano Holders Suffering Losses? Amid the fluctuating timelines for Spot Ethereum’s debut, the CBOE’s confirmation carries significant weight, aligning with the summer launch date projected by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The adjustment to a July 23 launch date is partly due to delays from several Spot Ethereum ETF issuers, who have needed to amend and resubmit their S-1 registration forms to the SEC for review and approval. The five Spot ETH ETFs set to begin trading on July 23 include Fidelity Ethereum ETF Fund (FETH), Ark 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF (CETH), Franklin Ethereum ETF (EZET), VanEck Ethereum ETF (ETHV), and Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF (QETH). The launch of these Spot Ethereum ETFs represents a significant milestone in the crypto market, providing investors the opportunity to gain exposure to ETH without the significant risks of volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, the introduction of Spot Ethereum ETFs is set to bring greater diversification in the crypto market, offering investors a new trading option beyond Spot Bitcoin ETFs. While CBOE’s confirmation of Spot Ethereum ETFs launch is a promising development for the crypto market, the real focus will be on the performance and demand of these ETFs, as their success could set a precedent for more crypto ETF filings in the future. Will ETH ETFs Match Bitcoin ETFs Demand Post Launch? The performance of Ethereum Spot ETFs has been a hot topic in the crypto space, as analysts constantly analyze whether the demand for ETH ETFs could potentially match or even surpass that of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: Can Burns Send The Shiba Inu And LUNC Price To $0.01?

Bitcoin Price Unaffected By Global IT Outage Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike shed light on the cause of the outages, attributing them to a “routine software update” that went wrong. To reassure the public, CrowdStrike emphasized that the incident was not a security breach or cyberattack. The company then quickly issued a new software update that automatically repaired some affected computers. However, some systems required manual reboots and patching, resulting in significant delays. Related Reading: ETH Derivates Volume Have Flatlined Despite Spot Ethereum ETFs Approval, What’s Going On? Microsoft, on its part, announced the recovery of its 365 apps and services late Friday morning, though some individual customers may still experience residual impact. Interestingly, amid the chaos caused by the IT outage, cryptocurrency prices remained unaffected, capturing the attention of US Senator Cynthia Lummis. Known for her pro-crypto and Bitcoin stance, Senator Lummis took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to highlight the resilience of the Bitcoin price amid widespread cyber outages, stating: “Do you know what form of currency hasn’t been affected by widespread cyber outages? Bitcoin. Vires in Numeris.” Meanwhile, speculation surrounding Bitcoin’s potential as a strategic reserve asset for the United States has been intensifying. Anticipation has been further fueled by the upcoming appearance of former US President Donald Trump in Nashville on July 27, who some predict will announce the largest cryptocurrency on the market as a key to the US economy, potentially providing a massive boost to the Bitcoin price. Sell Signal Emerges As the Bitcoin price continues its recovery, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has detected a significant development on the Bitcoin daily chart as the TD Sequential indicator has generated a sell signal. However, the analyst noted that the signal can be invalidated if Bitcoin manages to close above the crucial threshold of $67,500. The cryptocurrency’s current price stands at $66,666, reflecting a 5% increase within the past 24 hours and an impressive surge of over 16% in the past week alone. Sustaining a close above the level identified by Martinez becomes paramount to avoid a potential correction on its path towards the highly anticipated $70,000 milestone.

The Solana-based memecoin flipped Ethereum’s Layer-2 (L2) Arbitrum (ARB) and is currently testing the $2.5 resistance level. However, a crypto analyst has warned investors of a possible retrace for WIF. Related Reading: Injective (INJ) Breaches Key Resistance, Setting Stage For 1,350% Boom — Analyst WIF Puts Its Hat Back On Dogwifhat became the memecoin sensation of 2024’s first quarter (Q1), giving returns of over 2,000% earlier this year. The Solana token reached an all-time high (ATH) of $4.8 in March but has declined 45% since then. Despite this, investors remain bullish on the memecoin, some stating it has shown strength through its sharpest correction. Asad Saddique, Cryptonary’s CTO, highlighted that the token “withstood like 5 or 6 corrections of >70%.” To Saddique, Dogwifhat solidified during the retraces and “challenges” for the dog-themed memecoin throne. Notably, WIF flipped Arbitrum as the 38th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization today with a $2.5 billion market cap. This feat was first achieved on March 31, when WIF reached its ATH and a market cap of $4.57 billion. A month ago, crypto trader Bluntz, who made several bullish forecasts for WIF during Q1, shared a bearish prediction for the memecoin. Per the trader, the Solana token was set to an “inevitable” fall to the $1 range. However, this prediction was based on a previous bullish analysis. Bluntz stated that WIF was headed for a large retrace before the next parabolic run, which could lead to a new ATH. Following the market downturn, the dog-themed memecoin saw a price reduction of over 43%. Earlier this month, WIF dropped from the $2.6 price range to as low as $1.51 on July 11. Nonetheless, it had a remarkable performance this week. The token reclaimed the $2 support zone and exhibits green numbers in several timeframes. Will It Shred Another 40% Soon? WIF surged 8% in the last 24 hours and trades at $2.54, at the time of this writing. This performance represents a 60% and 25% price increase in the weekly and monthly timeframes. The recent price action has seemingly revitalized the bullish sentiment towards the token. Crypto analyst Hornhairs claimed that the memecoin “looks solid.” To the analyst, WIF could retest the $3 resistance level if it holds above the $2.2 price range. However, another market watcher has warned investors about a potential downside for Dogwifhat. CrediBull stated that people are taking most altcoins’ bounces as “a sign of strength, but the reality is, alts and especially memes are just higher beta versions of BTC.” To the analyst, the current bounce is “nice,” but, if Bitcoin (BTC) bounces or falls, Dogwifhat will follow the flagship cryptocurrency’s movement “harder/stronger. Related Reading: FET Surges 12% Ahead Of ASI Token Merger Phase 2, Can It Hit $5? The memecoin “left a triple bottom right below us” after making a lower high on higher timeframes.

31244804,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630596,1721446214,"Crypto Market Rebounds From Lows, But Why Are Cardano Holders Suffering Losses?","Despite the crypto market recovery, a large number of Cardano holders are still nursing losses, leading to speculations as to why this is the case. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that the altcoin is the worst performer in terms of profitability when it comes to the top 10 largest cryptocurrency by market cap, disappointing holders and long-term believers. Cardano Profitability Sits At Only 15% The Cardano profitability has remained low since the market crash of 2022 and even with the market recovery, the majority of investors are still underwater on their investments. This comes as the ADA price has failed to follow the market trend, beaten down at major resistances such as $0.6. and $0.7. Related Reading: Why Did The German Government Sell Off 50,000 Bitcoin In 2 Weeks Currently, IntoTheBlock data shows that only 25% of all Cardano owners are seeing any profit. On the flip side, the vast majority of 66% are currently out of the money, meaning they are in losses. The remaining 9% are sitting at neutral, meaning they are currently at breakeven as the current price is the same as the price the coins were last moved at. With around 4.5 million Cardano holders, this means that only 1.11 million holders are seeing any kind of profit on their holdings. 2.96 million addresses are currently sitting at losses and 397,740 addresses are those sitting at breakeven. From here, if the price were to fall below $0.35 again, another 138,000 addresses will be plunged into losses, further widening the profitability gap. However, if the ADA price successfully moves above $0.47, it will send a fritter 85,590 addresses back into profit. Comparing The Profitability Of Top Cryptocurrencies To show how far behind Cardano is in terms of profitability, we put it up against other top cryptocurrencies for comparison. The largest cryptocurrency in the space, Bitcoin, is currently seeing 89% of all holders in profit with only 7% seeing losses and 5% at breakeven. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is seeing 82% of its holders in profit, 12% in losses, and 5% at breakeven. For Dogecoin, the number is also high, with 75% of all wallets in profit, 23% seeing losses, and 3% at breakeven. Related Reading: Prophet Brandon Briggs Predicts XRP Price Explosion To $10,000 This comparison shows just how badly Cardano is performing compared to its fellow large-cap cryptocurrencies. If the ADA price continues to struggle, the profitability gap could continue to widen from this point, plunging even more Cardano investors into the red. At the time of writing, the ADA price is trending at $0.42, with a 4.4% decline in the last day. However, on the weekly chart, it is holding 5.29% gains after a recovery last week.

Despite recent pressures from substantial Bitcoin liquidations by the Mt. Gox distribution and sales by the German government, Bitcoin’s price remains notably resilient. These developments indicate a strong appetite for big-money cryptocurrency investments, especially from experienced investors looking to profit off potential end-of-year rallies. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Could Be On The Verge Of a 30% Gain, Here’s Why $100,000 Call Options Signals This QCP Capital’s analysis highlights this trend, pointing out the continued confidence among institutions despite the German government’s injection of nearly 50,000 BTC into the market and the distribution of over $6 billion worth of Bitcoin to Mt. Gox creditors. These events have significantly increased the available supply of Bitcoin but have surprisingly not dampened the bullish market sentiment. Instead, they have catalyzed a strategic interest in December call options at the $100,000 strike price, underscoring a strong institutional belief in Bitcoin’s upward potential. This update signals that amid the happenings in the crypto market; institutional traders are not just passively observing but actively positioning themselves for what they believe will be a significant uptick in Bitcoin’s value. The focus on December $100,000 call options is more than speculative; it reflects a calculated bet on Bitcoin’s performance amid forthcoming market catalysts like the US elections. QCP Capital noted: This signals an even stronger conviction of a year-end rally as the odds of a Trump victory increases. Bitcoin Stabilizes in Familiar Trading Range Furthermore, QCP Capital revealed that with the perpetual funding rates stabilizing and volatility tapering, Bitcoin appears to be settling into a predictable trading range. This environment provides a relatively stable backdrop for institutions to place substantial bets. According to QCP Capital, large trades are centered around the $67,000 strike options, suggesting market players anticipate moving towards these levels before the month is out. This indicates that while the year-end may be a focus, these institutional players also see intermediate milestones. Related Reading: Watch Out Bears: Bitcoin’s Rally To This Mark Could Trigger $19 Billion Short Squeeze QCP Capital particularly noted: “Perp funding is back to flat, vols are drifting lower and BTC is back in the familiar range of 61k to 71k where it traded within for the entire of Q2 this year.

The decision has resulted in a notable price recovery for the exchange’s native token, Binance Coin (BNB), pushing it toward the $600 level. Court Grants Relief To Binance BAM Subsidiary A court filing reveals that BAM Trading Services and BAM Management US Holdings, collectively known as BAM, filed a motion seeking relief from a consent order. The court, upon consideration of the motion, granted the requested relief. As a result, Binance’s US subsidiary, BAM, is now authorized to hire third-party investment advisors to manage corporate assets, paving the way for BAM to invest client fiat funds in US Treasury Bills. Related Reading: Market Strategist Says Bitcoin Downtrend Is Finally Over, Here’s Where Price Is Headed Next Under the court-approved arrangement, BAM can invest certain customer fiat funds, currently held at BitGo, in US Treasury bills on a rolling four-week basis. However, to ensure compliance, BAM is prohibited from involving any third parties, including Binance Entities, in these investments. Notably, BAM must maintain sufficient USD liquidity on its platform to honor customer fiat withdrawal requests during the investment period. Additionally, BAM is required to amend its terms of use and provide appropriate notice to customers, aligning with the authorized investment activities. Compliance Journey Continues Interestingly, as part of the court’s decision, BAM is now permitted to custody assets with and transfer assets to wallets provided by non-affiliated third-party custodians located in the United States. To maintain control over customer assets, BAM Trading officers and employees based in the United States will solely direct and manage wallets’ private and administrative keys, as required by the court. All transfers and withdrawals will require approval from both BAM Trading and the respective third-party custodian. Importantly, the Binance Entities will not have possession, custody, or control over any assets held in wallets provided by the third-party custodians. The court approval comes after Binance’s agreement in November to pay a settlement of $4.3 billion to the US government. This settlement included a forfeiture of $2.5 billion and a fine of $1.8 billion. As part of the agreement, the former CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), faced charges of violating the Bank Secrecy Act and agreed to step down from his position. CZ is currently serving a four-month sentence. BNB Price Breaks Above 200-Day EMA Currently trading at $597, BNB’s price has risen over 5% on the news, after dropping as low as $455 on July 5.

31237844,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=630570,1721435459,XRP Adoption & Activity Spike: What This Means For Its Price,"On-chain data shows XRP is observing a spike in its adoption and network activity. Here’s what this could mean for the asset. XRP New Addresses & Active Addresses Have Both Spiked According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, XRP has seen two metrics hit the highest levels since March recently. The first indicator of interest here is the “Network Growth,” which keeps track of the total number of new addresses being created on the network daily. Spikes in the Network Growth can appear for a couple of reasons. The most obvious of the two is fresh adoption, as new investors coming in would naturally create new addresses. The other factor can be existing users creating multiple wallets for a purpose like privacy. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Fill Up Bags As DOGE Price Dips 5% Generally, both are at play whenever the indicator rises, so it can be assumed that some net cryptocurrency adoption is occurring. The second relevant indicator is the “Daily Active Addresses,” which measures the total number of unique addresses participating in some transaction activity on the network daily. The active addresses can be considered the same as the unique number of active users on the chain, so this indicator’s value can tell us about the daily traffic the coin is currently witnessing. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in both of these metrics for XRP over the last couple of months: As the above graph shows, sharp spikes in XRP in the network growth and daily active addresses have recently been observed. This would suggest that the network is observing both an influx of users and activity from existing ones. More specifically, the blockchain saw 1,721 new addresses coming online and 47,363 users interacting at the peak of this spike. This growth for the cryptocurrency has come as its price has surged by more than 18% over the past week. Investors find sharp price actions like rallies exciting, so new users get attracted to the network, and existing ones come alive to make some moves during these periods. As such, these latest spikes in the Network Growth and Daily Active Addresses aren’t unusual. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forming A Signal That’s Usually “Very Bullish,” Analyst Says Spikes like these are essential for any rally to be sustainable, as the increased traffic provides the fuel such a move needs to keep going. Any rallies in the past that have failed to attract attention have ended up dying off before long. Thus, this development may be positive for XRP’s latest recovery run, at least on paper. XRP Price While the on-chain metrics are looking optimistic, the XRP price has still encountered an obstacle, as it has dropped back to $0.55 after breaking above $0.63 just a couple of days back.
