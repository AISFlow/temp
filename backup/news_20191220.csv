42431319,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1jHh,1576882962,SEC Punts Decision on Wilshire Phoenix's Bitcoin ETF Proposal to February,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed making a decision on a bitcoin and U.S. Treasury bond exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposal filed by Wilshire Phoenix.      According to a document published Friday, the SEC will continue evaluating the proposal, which was first filed earlier this summer, setting Feb. 26, 2020 as its next decision date to approve or reject the ETF proposal.      The securities regulator has been loathe to approve any bitcoin ETF, rejecting more than a dozen in the last two years. The agency has pointed to concerns about market manipulation and surveillance sharing as two areas it would like to see bolstered before it would approve an ETF.      Wilshire Phoenix believes it has found a way to address these concerns. In an interview with CoinDesk in November, Wilshire founder and managing partner William Herrmann said the fact that his company's proposal, filed with NYSE Arca, is a multi-asset trust protects it against bitcoin's price volatility.      Should volatility increase, the trust will automatically rebalance itself to decrease its bitcoin exposure and increase its exposure to the Treasury bills. As volatility falls, so too does the Treasury bill exposure.      The company filed a comment letter on Dec. 18 in an attempt to further assuage these concerns. Herrmann told CoinDesk Friday that the letter ""addresses how the [exchange-traded product] is structurally and fundamentally different from prior bitcoin-related ETP applications.""      ""The comment goes on to show how the two markets that are relevant to the Trust – referred to by the Commission as the 'regulated markets of significant size' – are the CME bitcoin futures market and the spot market composed of the five constituent exchanges from which pricing for the CME CF BRR is determined,"" he said.      The five exchanges include Coinbase, Kraken, itBit, Bitstamp and Gemini, and they represent the majority of the bitcoin-U.S. dollar market, he said. The exchanges also have surveillance-sharing agreements with the CME and CF Benchmarks, the reference rate's administrator.      It remains unclear whether the SEC will approve any bitcoin ETF in the near-term. The most recent rejection, when the SEC denied Bitwise Asset Management's latest bid, reiterated the agency's concerns.      The SEC Commissioners are reviewing that rejection, though it is unclear when they might reach a decision.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/20/sec-punts-decision-on-wilshire-phoenixs-bitcoin-etf-proposal-to-february,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/42dd537765c73d67dae5bc8e07bdc5bb7eff2259-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

One patent aims to reduce the time to verify block data, while the other is designed to help participants set a validity period for a transaction in a blockchain network.       Both of the patents were approved by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) this week.       The approvals comes at a time with Ant Financial, the fintech arm of Alibaba, announced the launch of its Ant Open Blockchain Alliance, a consortium that aims to finance small and medium-sized businesses on its blockchain-based platform.       According to the patent filing, when data are added to a node the new technology will determine the update verification value of the node by using just the newly added data, not all the data in the block.       “The application will alleviate a problem in the existing technology, that much time is consumed because a verification value is calculated by using all data in a block,” the filing said.       The other patent will be used to set up a validity period for a transaction, meaning participants of a blockchain network can only process the transaction during a certain period of time via either a physical clock or a logical clock, according to Alibaba’s filing.       For example, the blockchain can be a consortium blockchain consisting of a third-party payment platform server, a domestic bank server, a foreign bank server and several user node devices serving as member devices.       The operator of the blockchain can set up a validity period and deploy online services such as cross-border payment and asset transfers, the filing said.

42403747,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgcW0,1576868414,A Decade of Quantitative Easing Has Paved the Way for the Age of Digital Currency,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Michael J. Casey is CoinDesk’s chief content officer. The views expressed here are his own.      Our social media-constrained attention spans make it hard to focus on anything lasting longer than 24 hours, let alone a decade.      So, we risk missing the big, secular trends that lead to the kinds of paradigm shifts Bridgewater Associates founder and co-chairman Ray Dalio speaks of. Once they’ve occurred, and the world you were used to suddenly disappears, it’s too late.      Thankfully, the Roman calendar periodically offers an excuse to sit back and reflect on longer time frames. We have one of those moments right now: the end of the 2010s.      For most capital market investors, the past 10 years are perhaps best described as the “decade of QE.” And they don’t mean a British monarch or an ocean liner.      Through a radical policy of “quantitative easing” introduced to counter the “zero lower bound” problem in interest rates, the central banks of the U.S., the euro zone, and Japan have added almost $10 trillion in assets to their balance sheets since the end of 2009.      Given that massive surfeit, nothing else mattered much to financial markets. Stocks, bonds and commodities moved in ever closer correlation to one another. Mostly they rose, though sometimes they fell, all in lock-step dependence on monetary policymakers administering the drug of QE.      There are many reasons to believe that this massive intervention has created a giant distortion.      One that gets attention is the fact that, at one point, $17 trillion of dollars in bonds traded at negative yields this year, meaning that investors had too much cash and were willing to pay “safe” creditors for the privilege of taking their money.      But there are other warning signs that the QE-fueled market runup is starkly out of line with the realities of the world. As Bank of America chief strategist Michael Harnett put it in a recent research report, “We enter the next decade with interest rates at 5,000-year lows, the largest asset bubble in history, a planet that is heating up, and a deflationary profile of debt, disruption, and demographics.""      So, while the decade of QE might seem like the ultimate expression of central bank power and influence, the next decade may produce the opposite: a reversal that reveals central bankers’ impotence. The fear is that monetary authorities have spent all their ammunition, leaving nothing for the next crisis.      That would mean a paradigm shift is coming. What would it look like?    Also, the cryptocurrency decade    A new class of investor that emerged this past decade believes it knows the answer. They’d call the past ten years the “decade of cryptocurrency,” and they’d have a strong case.      In the future, when we look back on the emergence of bitcoin, we may well conclude it was the most important financial development of our time. Like nothing else, it changed the way we think about money.      That said, I’m not convinced the post-QE era will be the bitcoin era.      Bitcoin’s daily transaction flow, usually in the low billions of dollars, pales in comparison to the trillions in fiat currencies traded each day in foreign exchange markets. More likely than bitcoin becoming the new global monetary standard, I’d say, is that it becomes digital gold. In other words, that bitcoin will be to the digital era what gold was to the analog era: a safe-haven store of value that’s free from government interference.      Even so, to believe bitcoin is having no impact on the broader world of money is naïve. The biggest, most important developments in finance right now – namely, the digital currency aspirations of central banks such as the People’s Bank of China and the European Central Bank, as well as the Libra project launched by Facebook – trace a direct line to bitcoin and its crypto imitators.      Those fiat-backed prototypes are fundamentally different from decentralized cryptocurrencies in that their record-keeping and monetary policy features are centrally managed. Yet they still borrow heavily from the core breakthroughs that bitcoin established.      The protocols behind these new fiat-backed digital coins will, for example, create digital scarcity, meaning that, like cryptocurrencies, they can function as a de facto form of cash or bearer instrument. That’s quite different from the bank-issued IOUs of our current payments system. Also, they’ll essentially be programmable, which when combined with smart contracts and wallet-enabled internet-of-things (IoT) devices will transform the world’s commerce.      But the biggest, most politically important disruption will be to the dollar- and banking-led world of finance.      If digital fiat currencies become commonplace for payments, they’ll eventually remove banks for that core function of economic exchange, relegating them to longer-term lending functions. That will, in turn, mean that banks are no longer engaged by central banks as the core intermediaries for managing our monetary conditions.      Also, if coin-to-coin atomic swaps and smart contract-based escrow solutions are used in cross-border transactions, the rise of digital fiat might quickly spell the end of the dollar’s dominance of global trade, with profound implications for the United States.      The upshot of all this is that central banks will initially acquire even more direct control over monetary conditions. However, they will do so within a digitized environment in which no single currency enjoys global hegemonic dominance and in which users can more easily move in and out of state, private or decentralized currencies of their choosing. That increased currency competition should, in theory, impose a constraint on each sovereign’s capacity to debase their citizens’ money.      We face a paradigm shift, in other words.      When they come to write about this period, my guess is that historians will look upon the 2010s as the decade that set up that shift. Explaining it, they’ll point to two main developments: that QE exposed the limitations of the existing, bank-centric system and that cryptocurrencies emerged to posit an alternative model.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Michael J.

Announced Friday, CipherTrace has provided ATII with access to its user interface, a tool that will allow the organization to track criminal cryptocurrency transactions and help prevent them from accessing financial services.      ""CipherTrace will be an instrumental partner in helping us promote corporate responsibility within financial institutions such as cryptocurrency exchanges,"" said Aaron Kahler, ATII founder and president. ""As public and private organizations continue to collaborate in the creation of a uniform front within the financial sector to fight human trafficking, we will see a true impact in the recovery of victims and prosecution of traffickers.""      An October update significantly increased the number of cryptocurrencies that CipherTrace's tool was able to track. It can currently cover more than 700 different cryptos, including 87 percent of the top-100 by market cap. It has also made the complete financial transaction histories for top coins like bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin available to its client base, which include several law enforcement agencies.      ATII is a non-profit founded earlier this year to combat the modern-day slave trade through sharing intelligence as well as disrupting operations wherever possible. Pamela Clegg, CipherTrace's director of financial investigations and education, has joined ATII's advisory board to provide guidance and expertise on how the organization can most effectively track cryptocurrency transactions.      ""Human trafficking is modern-day slavery and involves the use of force, fraud or coercion to obtain some type of labor of commercial sex act,"" Clegg said in a statement. ""As with most criminal organizations and activities, following the money is the most effective way to combat this global crime.""      Modern human trafficking, which has claimed more than 40 million victims globally, is an industry worth approximately $150 billion, according to statistics from the International Labour Organization. CipherTrace has already partnered with agencies, including INTERPOL and Lawyers Without Borders, to prevent human traffickers from using cryptocurrencies to sidestep conventional financial controls.      In the past, CipherTrace has been quick to point out instances where cryptocurrency businesses have not complied with financial regulation. The firm's Q3 Cryptocurrency Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Report found that a third of all exchanges had little or no know-your-customer (KYC) verification checks.

According to a letter penned by Representatives Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), Bill Foster (D-Ill.), David Schweikert (R-Ariz.), Darren Soto (D-Fla.), Lance Gooden (R-Texas), French Hill (R-Ark.), Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) latest guidance clarifies some aspects of the tax treatment for cryptocurrencies, but leaves much to be desired.      Several of the congressmen who signed the letter, including Emmer, Soto, Foster and Schweikert, are members of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, a formal group of lawmakers who advocate for blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Friday's letter was first shared by industry think tank Coin Center.      The IRS published guidance around taxing cryptocurrency holdings in October, addressing cost basis and forks, two long-standing questions the crypto community has had.      However, the new guidance raised a number of new questions, particularly around airdrops and unwanted forks. There was also no de minimis exemption for small purchases, such as a cup of coffee.      Friday's letter pointed to these unwanted forks and airdrops as one major area of concern, noting that the current guidance appears to suggest individuals are liable for taxes on any cryptocurrencies they gain as a result of a hard fork or airdrop, regardless of whether or not they're aware they received these cryptocurrencies.      ""This creates potentially unwarranted tax liability and administrative burdens for users of these important new technologies and would create inequitable results,"" the letter said. ""We do not expect this is the intended effect of the guidance, and we urge the IRS to clarify the matter.""      The letter specifically asks:    ""Does the IRS intend to clarify its airdrop and fork hypotheticals to better match the actual nature of these events within the cryptocurrency ecosystem? When does the IRS anticipate issuing that clarification?""  ""Does the IRS intend to clarify its standard for finding dominion and control over forked assets wherein some level of knowledge and actual affirmative steps taken are necessary to find that the taxpayer has dominion and control?""  ""Does the IRS intend to apply the current guidance or any future guidance retroactively, or will the IRS issue proposed guidance that is subject to notice and comment?""    The letter also said the congressmen are ""concerned that the form of the guidance appears to indicate that this is 'established' law.""      The congressmen wrote that they hope the IRS continues to treat crypto as a ""new and developing"" area, and hope the questions listed are answered ""as soon as possible.""      The IRS has been ramping up its efforts in taxing crypto transactions, writing letters to exchange users warning they may need to restate their earnings and adding a question about cryptocurrency in its Form 1040.

42403749,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgcXy,1576863000,Crypto Must Embrace the Fringe to Win Over the Mainstream,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Jeffrey Amico is an attorney at Fluidity, creators of the ethereum-based peer-to-peer trading network AirSwap.      In his seminal book The Innovator’s Dilemma, Clay Christensen explains how “disruptive” innovation occurs. Whereas incumbents are constrained by the needs and desires of their existing customers, new entrants can instead experiment with new technologies and target under-served or “fringe” customers. In the eyes of mainstream users, these new innovations initially look and perform worse than existing offerings. Often times, they start out looking like a toy.      Critically, however, they offer certain distinct attributes or features that are highly valued by the under-served customer segment. Over time, if the product is truly disruptive, the mainstream users will realize that they too want the new features, and will come to demand them as well. Through this progression, disruptive innovations move from the fringe to the mainstream, until they eventually overtake the incumbent’s offerings. Crypto entrepreneurs can follow this same roadmap to achieve mainstream adoption.    The Path Forward    At their core, blockchains are shared computing systems that users can trust to record data and execute code as instructed. Because they sit outside the control of any particular entity or government, blockchains enable things like privacy, transparency and trust-minimization. While it is easy - and perhaps characteristic - for crypto entrepreneurs to assume instant universal demand for a financial system built around these features, there remain significant roadblocks to mainstream adoption. The most notable is that - at least in most developed economies - existing financial markets and products tend to work quite well for most users. It makes little sense for these types of users to switch over to a nascent technology that offers worse performance on the metrics they care about.      A better approach is to think critically about who is actually under-served by the current system, and how the specific attributes of blockchain technology can be leveraged to meet those needs. The use cases within this category are not novel. They are the same ones that have been discussed for years. Private payments. Cross-border remittances. Data sovereignty. Access to credit and other core financial services for the world’s 1.7 billion unbanked. Providing actual utility to users of this sort (as opposed to mere speculative utility) is not easy. It will require the industry to overcome significant technical, legal and political obstacles before these use cases can be realized at scale.      Infrastructure must improve to ensure would-be crypto users can actually access the internet at times when they need it the most. Regulatory clarity (and if possible, relief) must be achieved on issues that stand to undermine crypto’s immense potential, including antiquated money transmission laws. Policymakers must come to understand that crypto is not an illicit tool for criminals and money launderers, but rather a tool to expand access to financial services for underserved individuals. Asset volatility must be reduced before individuals will use crypto for bona fide, non-speculative use cases. These obstacles are real and will take significant work to be overcome.      And yet, there are reasons to be optimistic today.      At the protocol level, Bitcoin continues to grow more resilient and trustworthy with each added block. Developers continue to build “Layer 2” solutions to enhance mainstream useability. Stablecoins and open financial applications continue to develop and gain traction. USDC, for one, has grown to nearly $500 million outstanding in just over a year. Tether, despite its regulatory troubles, has over $4 billion outstanding and facilitates billions of dollars of stable-value transactions every day. Platforms like Maker and Compound have originated nearly $900 million in permissionless loans in less than two years. These are the core building blocks of a more open and accessible financial system, and they are making progress.    From the Fringe to the Mainstream    Ultimately, for crypto to move sustainably into the mainstream, it must provide utility beyond mere speculation. For that to occur, entrepreneurs should lean into the features that make blockchains different - namely, trustless computing - and build products that are uniquely enabled by those features. Doing so will produce truly differentiated products that certain would-be users need and care about, but can’t access today. Once these products gain a foothold among those “fringe” users, mainstream users will eventually take notice and come to want certain of their features (e.g., privacy) as well. This process may take years or even decades of hard work to accomplish. But that is true of any disruptive technology. Crypto will be no different.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jeffrey Amico,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/20/crypto-must-embrace-the-fringe-to-win-over-the-mainstream,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4a9af98b01b68ac015164692d1c55ee06e08e91b-1200x788.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

We take a moment to look at historical adoption over time, and how it might apply to national cryptocurrencies.      No time to listen? Scroll down for the full transcript.      On today's episode:    Markets, international and industry news roundup  Iran wants a ""muslim"" cryptocurrency, and it's not alone  Industrial-scale bitcoin miners are starting to use Wall Street–style hedging instruments         Transcript      Adam B. Levine: On today’s episode, Back to Normal Bitcoin, Nation-State Crypto, and Miner Hedging Strategies.      Adam: It’s Dec. 20, 2019, and you’re listening to Markets Daily. I’m Adam B. Levine, editor of Podcasts here at CoinDesk, along with our senior markets reporter, Brad Keoun, to give you a concise daily briefing on crypto markets and some of the most important news developments in the sector over the past 24 hours.      Brad Keoun: Bitcoin appears to havesettled back into the range where it’s traded for the past month, roughly in a range between $6,500 and $7,800.      This morning the price is down just a touch, on light volume, to about $7,100, right in the middle of that range.      As we head into the final weeks of the year, bitcoin is up 93 percent year to date, though traders are wondering if the price next year could rise back above that June high around $13,880.      Adam: Turning to Europe, the German stock exchange owner Boerse Stuttgart Group is teaming up with Japanese financial giant SBI Group on a joint initiative to expand their digital assets businesses internationally.      SBI will take a stake in the German exchange’s regulated digital assets-trading platform and also might invest in its venture-capital unit.      The partnership aims to develop “a truly global end-to-end ecosystem for digital assets, utilizing blockchain technology.”      In the U.S., Forbes reports that Congressman Paul Gosar, an Arizona Republican, has introduced a draft bill called the Crypto-Currency Act of 2020 to clarify regulation of digital assets.      The bill would create three categories of digital assets: cryptocurrencies, crypto-commodities and crypto-securities.      Brad: And in industry news, the big crypto exchange Binance has invested an undisclosed amount of money in derivatives platform FTX as part of a strategic partnership between the two firms.      According to the announcement, Binance has purchased equity in FTX, but it also purchased positions in FTX’s digital token.      Separately, the venture funds Dragonfly Capital and Paradigm have acquired $27.5 million worth of MakerDAO’s MKR tokens and plan to take part in the network’s governance.      Announced Thursday, the investment will fund the Maker foundation's efforts to promote adoption in China and the broader Asia region of MakerDAO’s dai token.      Dai is a dollar-pegged stablecoin that’s become an increasingly watched part of the fast-emerging emerging landscape of decentralized finance, known as DeFi, essentially distributed networks that some industry participants hope could eventually supplant banks and other big financial companies.      Adam: Bloomberg reports that the big U.S. hedge fund Fortress will renew its efforts to buy creditors' claims from the defunct Mt. Gox cryptocurrency exchange, offering to pay up to 70 cents on the dollar on their account value.      Based in Japan, Mt. Gox was once the world’s biggest Bitcoin exchange, until it closed in early 2014 after losing hundreds of thousands of bitcoins.      Thousands of Bitcoins have since been found, which have, of course, increased more than 10-fold over the past five years.      Brad: And finally, Reggie Fowler, an Arizona businessman who was a minority owner of the National Football League’s Minnesota Vikings, plans to plead guilty to federal allegations that he ran a shadow banking service for cryptocurrency startups.      According to an indictment earlier this year, Fowler and an associate opened bank accounts at various financial institutions to store funds on behalf of cryptocurrency exchanges but told the banks they would process real-estate transactions.      A hearing has been scheduled for January in New York.      SEGMENT 2 - FEATURED STORY (Muslim Cryptocurrency & History's Guide to Fringe Adoption)      Adam: Turning to today's featured story, CoinDesk’s David Pan writes that    Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the Muslim world needs its own cryptocurrency to fight American economic domination in international trade and cut reliance on the dollar.coindesk.com/iran-president-we-need-a-muslim-cryptocurrency-to-fight-the-us-dollar  “The Muslim world should be designing measures to save themselves from the domination of the United States dollar and the American financial regime,"" he said at the Kuala Lumpur Summit in Malaysia on Thursday. coindesk.com/iran-president-we-need-a-muslim-cryptocurrency-to-fight-the-us-dollar  Iran has been hit with severe economic sanctions by the U.S. that limit how the nation’s financial institutions make investments abroad since the dollar is the most common currency in international transactions. The Iranian government has been working on expanding the use of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin to circumvent the U.S. sanctions.coindesk.com/iran-president-we-need-a-muslim-cryptocurrency-to-fight-the-us-dollar    Adam: While there are no functional nation-state or central bank digital currencies yet, if history is any guide this is a temporary thing.      When crypto technology got its start just a little more than 10 years ago it presented a new possibility, but also new risks. The early users who gravitated to bitcoin were pretty much without exception outliers from society at large in some way. In the early days these were libertarians unhappy with the economic order of things and those who wanted to buy something they weren’t allowed to online. For both of these types of users even a very, very early bitcoin offered significant advantages, which is why they used it. And while those demographics have not grown as bitcoin has over time, they did kick-start its demographic explosion by proving what was possible, and making the opportunity obvious to those with less incentives to try something new.  At the nation-state level, we see a similar pattern emerging over the past few years, with the troubled Venezuelan government introducing the “petro” as a way to bypass U.S. sanctions, to reportedly limited deployment and certainly limited effect. Iran falls into this same bucket. It’s been said that bitcoin doesn’t ignore borders, it transcends them as if none exist. That’s an element that’s wildly valuable to any nation finding itself on the wrong end of a U.S. dollar reserve currency denominated financial system as it provides a distributed alternative which can’t be stopped by banks, bombs or bullets.      Beyond the economic outcasts, this last year we’ve heard of less controversial if not more important efforts like the Marshall Islands national digital currency or, perhaps most interesting of all, China’s long-teased move to a digital yuan.      These moves aren’t here yet, but they are tangible, they are important and they are coming. And if it was bitcoin’s early fringe users who led to the vibrant, global cryptocurrency ecosystem we see today, can you imagine, what’ll happen next?      Adam: And now, for today’s spotlight, we’re looking at a new derivatives market in the crypto industry - this one tailored not for bitcoin traders, but for bitcoin miners.      Brad: For today’s spotlight, we’re looking at a growing practice in the cryptocurrency mining business: hedging.      Earlier this week we brought you the news that Canaan, a big Chinese maker of computers for mining bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, was seeing a big drop in its stock price, thanks partly to a sales slump in the industry but also due to price competition from the industry leader, Bitmain.      Well, part of the backstory there is that the big purchases of crypto-mining computers are increasingly coming from large-scale operations that can get their costs down by buying in bulk and also negotiating electricity-supply contracts at cheap wholesale rates.      That’s crucial because some of these so-called mining farms consume the same amount of power as a small town or city, with the computers, known as mining rigs, working to confirm transactions on the blockchain 24 hours a day, seven days a week.      As the business becomes more institutional, the finances of these operations are become more sophisticated as well, with more of an eye on risk-management.      To that end, it’s becoming increasingly common for mining firms to hedge their future output.      Reuters reported earlier this month that crypto miners are now using derivatives not just to hedge price risks, but to hedge against changes in bitcoin’s hashrate, or the total amount of processing power on the network.      The hashrate, which is in some ways akin to the way oil traders analyze the weekly count of drilling rigs, can be quite volatile along with the price.      These derivatives work sort of like business-protection insurance, helping mining firms to avoid losses if the hashrate suddenly changes for the worse.      According to a press release on Thursday, the digital-asset trading firm GSR, which says its leadership team includes former executives from the Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs and Japanese bank Nomura, says it has partnered with Interhash, which is a strategic partner of Canaan’s, to provide a customized suite of derivatives for the mining industry.      The suite will include swaps, collars and more bespoke structured products, according to the press release.      The cost of mining equipment and electricity are constantly in flux, says Cristian Gil, GSR’s co-founder.      The unpredictability of their business models is unprecedented, so it is natural that this segment of the market is exploring ways to better hedge their risk, he says.      The companies estimate that some $3 billion of bitcoin will be mined in 2020 alone, based on current prices.      Richard Rosenblum, GSR’s co-founder, acknowledged that this hedging market in bitcoin remains small compared with traditional commodities.      But this market could grow along with the crypto industry, he says.      The announcement serves as a reminder that, with bitcoin’s price volatility quadrupling during the first half of this year and then tumbling by 50 percent, the mining business can be a dicey proposition, and it’s increasingly turning to Wall Street-style tools to manage the substantial risks.

Instead of quietly infecting and requesting ransom from victims, the so-called Maze team is publicly exposing victims by displaying real files exfiltrated from their hacked servers.      This tactic could be a disaster for crypto companies that may have put private keys or other important financial data into their private archives, should they be breached.      ""Represented here companies don't wish to cooperate with us, and trying to hide our successful attack on their resources. Wait for their databases and private papers here,"" write the hackers on their public website, mazenews.top. ""Follow the news!""      Companies that have already been hit by the group include a grocery chain, Busch's Inc., in Ann Arbor, Mich., and a lawn and garden company, Massey Services, in Florida. We've reached out to the alleged Maze victims; many have already made public information about the hacks on their websites.      Another group, called REvil, promises to release for free or sell vital company information to competitors if its ransom is not paid. The hackers wrote:    Each attack includes a copy of private, commercial information. In case they refuse to pay, the data will either be sold to competitors or posted on open sources. We're interested in seeing how the GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] authorities react. If they do not want to pay us they can pay 10 times more to the government. No problem.Translated by CoinDesk    “For years, ransomware developers and affiliates have been telling victims that they must pay the ransom or stolen data would be publicly released,” said Lawrence Abrams, ransomware researcher at BleepingComputer. “While it has been a well-known secret that ransomware actors snoop through victim’s data, and in many cases steal it before the data [are] encrypted, they never actually carried out their threats of releasing it.”      ""This is especially ghastly news for companies that may already face steep fines and other penalties for failing to report breaches and safeguard their customers’ data. For example, healthcare providers are required to report ransomware incidents to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which often documents breaches involving lost or stolen healthcare data on its own site,"" wrote security researcher Brian Krebs.      A list of invoices is one thing; publicizing the keys to a company's crypto accounts are another thing entirely. Given the amount of data involved, there's no telling what valuable information could be lurking amid a company's paperwork.      One victim was quick to publicly react to a Dec. 9 attack.      ""As early as Tuesday morning [Dec. 10], we began bringing key business systems back online, prioritizing manufacturing and logistics functions that enable us to make and ship quality products to our customers,"" wrote Rich Stinson CEO of manufacturer SouthWire.

42403745,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgcV1,1576859400,"With So Much Debt Around, Investors Need Bitcoin as a Reflation Hedge","This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Ari Paul is CIO and managing partner of BlockTower, an investment firm.      Cryptocurrency has many value propositions, including censorship resistance, seizure resistance, and global coordination without middlemen. Until recently, one value proposition seemed largely hypothetical – depreciation resistance (that is, a store of value immune to inflationary money printing at the whim of central bankers or politicians). While bitcoin fans have long noted how fiat is devalued over time, bitcoin often appeared like a solution in search of a problem in this regard. With minimal inflation in the developed world over the past decade, most people were quite content to hold USD or EUR or JPY. When Argentines sought to escape their severely inflationary peso, they were happy to store their wealth in relatively stable USD. In 2019, we saw the emergence of cryptocurrency as an alternative store of value.      The modern financial system depends on a few critical narratives. One is that prices on capital markets reflect the decisions of rational buyers and sellers. Another is that the central banks can be trusted to manage the supply of leading fiat currencies to achieve, at worst, moderate inflation.      The first narrative broke after the financial crisis. Central banks became the largest buyers of sovereign debt issuances and forced interest rates to artificially low levels. Today, there is $17 trillion worth of sovereign debt in circulation offering negative yields. Investors are literally paying debtors to take their money. Many prominent investors, like Howard Marks of Oaktree, are noting that this is unsustainable and irrational at face value, a symptom of a broken market. As owners of central bank-inflated assets over the past decade, these same investors profited from this dislocation, but now they are publicly shouting warnings.      The second narrative is under attack from multiple angles. The political independence of central banks has long been viewed as sacrosanct, a critical pillar of confidence for markets. In 2019, president Donald Trump repeatedly attacked the Federal Reserve for failing to accommodate his wishes, going so far as to call the Federal Reserve Chairman an enemy of the country. We’ve seen similar political pressure on central banks through both the developed and emerging world.    Like Pavlov’s dogs salivating at the sound of a bell, investors have been well trained to continue betting on disinflation and USD strength.    Back in 2009, I was a young trader at Susquehanna International Group, a market making firm, I followed the financial crisis and subsequent global money printing with wide eyes. By mid 2009, I decided that deflation (or at least disinflation) was likely for the near future, but eventually the colossal expansion of fiat money supply would cause a general decline in fiat purchasing power. This thesis eventually led me to discover and invest in bitcoin.      I certainly wasn’t alone at being alarmed by quantitative easing, but overwhelming disinflationary forces have caused this story to play out in slow motion in traditional markets. Professional investors who tried to bet against central banks in the past decade had to give up that thesis or get fired for poor performance. And so even with increasing warning signs of an imminent regime shift, markets are slow to abandon the old mental models that worked for so long. Like Pavlov’s dogs salivating at the sound of a bell, investors have been well trained to continue betting on disinflation and USD strength.      Why might bitcoin take off as a hedge against currency depreciation? Legendary investor Ray Dalio, the founder of $160 billion AUM asset manager Bridgewater, makes a pithy case in an essay published July 17th, 2019:    “The big question worth pondering at this time is which investments will perform well in a reflationary environment accompanied by large liabilities coming due and with significant internal conflict between capitalists and socialists, as well as external conflicts. It is also a good time to ask what will be the next-best currency or storehold of wealth to have when most reserve currency central bankers want to devalue their currencies in a fiat currency system.”    Dalio answers his question by suggesting gold. He and most other traditional asset managers are not yet convinced that BTC is the answer, or even part of the answer. I think 2020 will be the year that he and other allocators realize that bitcoin is the reflation hedge they are looking for.

In a letter responding to EU lawmakers yesterday, Lagarde said stablecoins addressed many of the problems associated with the existing cross-border payments system. They offered users a cheaper and more efficient payment option that could help foster financial inclusion, she wrote.      But Lagarde highlighted that regulators would have to address concerns surrounding competition in the stablecoin market. Facebook may have an unfair advantage over smaller operators because it can use its social media platform to block out rivals and promote its own cryptocurrency.      ""If the entities that govern stablecoin arrangements control large digital platforms, they could impact the level playing field by promoting the use of their own solutions, with possible lock-in effects, and/or blocking other service providers or payment methods from their platforms,"" Lagarde wrote.      She also highlighted that Facebook could combine users' social media data with their financial data, giving them ""a strong competitive advantage and undermine market contestability.""      Lagarde's letter said stablecoins, such as Libra, should not go into operation until regulators had fully assessed the associated risks. Although efforts are already underway, Libra's cross-border nature means international coordination will be needed to ensure consistency.      Lagarde also said that the name ""stablecoin"" is misleading. Operators may promise holders a stable store of value, but prices depend on governance and the underlying asset. Investors, though, may not be aware that the value of their holdings is not assured.      ""It should be clear to stablecoin users that losses could occur and that they would not be covered by the traditional financial stability net, which includes deposit guarantee schemes and central banks’ role as lenders of last resort,"" Lagarde wrote.      Lagarde became ECB President in October, having previously been chair and managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). She has previously called on central bankers to consider issuing digital currencies and suggested regulators use blockchain technology to catch criminals.      Lagarde said the ECB should be ""ahead of the curve"" when it comes to central bank digital currencies, according to a Reuters report last week.      Other financial regulators have expressed concerns about the Libra project. One U.S. Federal Reserve governor said this week the project had not provided ""clarity"" on how it manages reserves, or the safeguards to protect holders.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission fined or settled with ICOs that had not registered as securities.      Against this backdrop, Facebook announced Libra, which spurred a greater global reaction than anything we’ve seen in the sector to date. The G7 established a working group on Libra and other stablecoins. France and Germany discussed a Libra ban.      The introduction of Libra took the concept of a “sovereign” digital currency mainstream. Although different from a central bank-issued digital currency (CBDC), Libra, if launched as originally conceived, is positioned to become a major alternative payment mechanism to traditional fiat, perhaps more so than cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Facebook has for many years attempted to enter the payments space. By corralling its current properties (including WhatsApp and Instagram), billions of global users as well as its announced consortium partners, Facebook would be able to reach scale in payments and create new revenue streams without officially becoming a bank.    Central banks are under threat from new technologies, just as Netflix disrupted Blockbuster.    Thanks to Facebook, the central banks suddenly took notice of the threat a privately backed digital currency would make to their business model. Central banks use monetary policy to manage their economies via inflation control and credit and, increasingly, cross-border trade. If an independent currency were to gain more use than central bank fiat, central banks’ ability to use monetary policy as a tool would be greatly diminished.      After the Libra announcement, China accelerated development of its own CBDC, even announcing major local partners such as WeChat. The deputy director of the People’s Bank of China said its motivation for launching a digital currency is ”to protect our monetary sovereignty…” Other countries and regions, including the other BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia and India) followed with their own announcements.      The countries’ interest in digital currencies is fueled by two factors. First, they provide central banks with the ability to closely track the currency (cash flows are much harder to track). Second, central banks can cut their reliance on dominant currencies including the US dollar. Alternatives are especially attractive to emerging and developing countries. Since the 2008 recession many countries, including Switzerland, have chafed under the challenges that increased US compliance, coupled with the dollar being used as the global reserve currency, has presented to the banking industry. If countries were to issue digital currencies, they could theoretically settle transactions directly without another (intermediary) currency involved. For instance, I am watching India closely. It has banned banks from banking crypto-related companies but has been public about exploring a digital rupee.      Digital currencies are not always cryptocurrencies. This distinction is important. A digital currency is simply a currency issued by an entity in digital form. In the case of CBDCs, that bank is a central bank. Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, on the other hand, are not issued by a central authority and rely on a network of decentralized miners to issue the currency and verify transactions.      While implementation and proliferation of CBDCs and other digital currencies may ease cross-border transactions and make consumers’ lives easier, they will also facilitate more tracking of transactions and tighter controls. Ironically, the increased global demand for decentralized bitcoin, as well as the interest in decentralized finance that gained steam in 2019, may have woken up central banks to the fact that they are under threat from new technologies, just as Netflix disrupted Blockbuster and Amazon disrupted Barnes and Noble. Next year will be one to watch on this front.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT,Jalak Jobanputra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/12/20/the-central-bank-business-model-is-under-attack,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e9f777539f7a1503faedc8084cc8523a8cbfa88f-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The news was made public by the Russian embassy in Greece, the country in which he has been held since his arrest in July 2017 over allegations he had laundered at least $4 billion through the BTC-e bitcoin exchange.      Vinnik’s extradition has been sought by the governments of the U.S., Russia and France. Vinnik himself had said he wanted to see trial in Russia.      The embassy told state-owned Russian news agency RIA Novosti on Friday it regrets Greece has not granted Russia's requests for the extradition of Vinnik.      ""At the first stage, Vinnik will be extradited to France. We informed Moscow about this. We are sorry to see that the reasonable request from Russia's Prosecutor General about Vinnik’s extradition to his country of citizenship was ignored,"" the embassy representative said.      The Greek minister of justice made the decision to extradite Vinnik to France, according to the embassy.      RIA Novosti also reports Vinnik has now gone on a hunger strike to protest the extradition decision.      He previously went on a hunger strike for 100 days in 2018 over claims his rights were being violated, RIA reported. Vinnik has maintained he is innocent of all charges, claiming he was just an employee at the exchange.      CoinDesk has reached out to Vinnik's attorney but had not received a reply by press time.      The decision to extradite the Russian to France was reportedly made last summer, but Russia has been fighting the move. Russian President Vladimir Putin had even raised he subject with the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras last December, as per another report from RIA Novosti.      France has been seeking Vinnik's extradition over alleged cybercrime, money laundering, membership in a criminal organization and extortion, according to Associated Press.

42403742,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgcS4,1576850488,French Financial Watchdog Approves First ICO Under New 'Visa' Scheme,"France's Financial Markets Authority (AMF) announced Thursday it had approved an initial coin offering (ICO) for the first time.      The successful recipient of the AMF ""ICO visa"" – a cryptocurrency fundraising platform called French-ICO – met the minimum guarantees required by law, including a white paper investors could understand, according to a statement from the regulator.      ICO visas are a means to ensure sales do not bring investors undue risk. Applicants must show the AMF they have provided all relevant information about the sale, as well as the risks involved. Approval is not an endorsement for the company.      The regulator can only approve public offerings for utility tokens, and an applicant must be a registered entity in France. They must also have procedures for securing investor funds and comply with strict anti-money laundering (AML) requirements. Once approved, the ICO must take place within six months.      France passed one of the most comprehensive legal frameworks for cryptocurrencies earlier this year. Known as the PACTE law, it provides companies legal certainty in return for being regulated by the AMF. That includes a guaranteed bank account, as well as the option to host a token sale in the country using the ICO visa.      AMF approval further allows a company to market its sale and engage in promotional activities.      Registration is optional, however. Companies can still host an unregistered ICO in France but they are not allowed to promote the sale to potential investors.      Reuters reported in July that the watchdog was talking to three or four candidates for an ICO visa.      Although the news was announced Thursday, French-ICO received its visa on Tuesday. Scheduled to begin in March, the sale is capped at €1 million ($1.1 million), according to its website. The visa runs out on June 1, 2020.      The AMF has come down hard on crypto companies that have broken French law.

42403756,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgcct,1576849432,Charlie Shrem: What I Still Love About Crypto,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Charlie Shrem is the former founder of BitInstant, co-founder of cryptocurrency intelligence service CryptoIQ and host of Untold Stories.      A central character in the early rise of bitcoin, Charlie Shrem is getting comfortable living in crypto’s slow lane.      Shrem earned his reputation, fortune and rap-sheet as the founder and CEO of one of the first bitcoin exchanges, BitInstant. In his early 20s, Shrem became a crypto celebrity. He travelled the world as a founder of the Bitcoin Foundation, and shored-up his nightlife by investing in EVR, the first bar to accept bitcoin in New York City.      This wild ride as a bitcoin evangelist took a left turn when, at 24, he was implicated in the Department of Justice’s investigation of the Silk Road. Shrem was sentenced for operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, after investigators found he had dealings with one of the darknet site’s market makers. Lionized instead of ostracized, Shrem’s celebrity only grew.      Following a one-year stint in prison, Shrem quickly adapted to the changes in the crypto industry. Though his early success was hard to replicate. His first post-prison venture, Intellisys Capital, a fund that planned to tokenized investments in manufacturing, real estate and sanitary waste firms, closed. At the height of the ICO boom, Shrem sat as an advisor for a number of projects. His own token offering was called off before the public sale, and Shrem returned funds to about a dozen private investors, he said.      Then, in September 2018, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss sued Shrem, alleging he had expropriated 5,000 bitcoins ($32 million at the time) from an earlier deal they made. The legal battle extended into the new year, when the parties decided to settle.      When he was ""young and stupid"" his ego told him he ""could do everything and be the best at everything. My personality prefers when I make my own mistakes to learn lessons, and I definitely learnt from the consequences that came after,"" Shrem said recently, when we spoke to him.      Bruised though not embittered, Shrem has taken a smaller role in the crypto industry. Since moving to Florida, he started two small businesses: CryptoIQ, a crypto advisory, and the Untold Stories podcast, which chronicles the history of the crypto industry. In a phone call, Shrem opened up about his regrets over the years, how the crypto industry has changed since he got his start and why he will never stop loving it.      CHARLIE SHREM: What can I do for you?      COINDESK: The idea is just to get your thoughts on the year. What stuck out for for you?      2019 for me was the year that everyone thought the bull market will come. It was a lot of building infrastructure, growing companies and products and bringing them to market faster than they probably would’ve, in preparation of a rally that never came. That’s why we’re sometimes seeing products flaws. But the bull market didn’t come.      You’ve been in crypto practically since the beginning. Did 2019 remind you of any other year?      I wasn't around in 2015, so I don’t know what it felt like, but the people I spoke to told me it was just a sad year. A bubble burst the first month of 2014, so people thought the bull market would come. There are parallels from this year to 2014. A lot of companies were founded, raised money or grew that year. Ledger, Coinbase. A lot of companies we use today were founded or had exponential growth in 2014.      But then, we had a whole other year of bear market.      So the question is, do we have another year or are we at the cusp of a bull market. I hate to say it, Dan. Can I call you Dan?      You can call me Dan.      Dan, I don't think we’ve seen the last of the bear market. Out of the seven bubbles I’ve been through over the past decade, this would’ve been the easiest one. Compared to how much we went down, how much people suffered. That’s your soundbite.      I think the recent volatility has made things exciting again.      You know why? In the last bull market people actually had to ask if bitcoin or crypto would continue to exist. There was fear. Now, even if bitcoin goes to zero, crypto is here to stay.      Were there any projects that launched this year you were excited about?      The answer is yes, but I have a policy not to name companies because I have sponsors. That’s my bread and butter. I’ll say this, the ones that I am most excited about are the ones that I allow to sponsor Untold Stories. I’ve said no to a lot of companies. I think we don’t give enough credit to companies that have been around a very long time in this space either. CoinDesk included. The longer you’ve been around, the more shit people give you.    I’ve learned that the people in our space are fucking brilliant.    What have you learned about the industry through podcasting?      I’ve learned that the people in our space are fucking brilliant. We attract some of the smartest and coolest people I’ve ever met. At this point, I've interviewed 41 executives from some of the most important companies in the space. They’re all very humble. Do you know how many times when I was interviewing CZ, he told me that it’s his team that does all the work. He’s right to a certain extent. I have a new appreciation for the people leading the industry forward. You’ll laugh, but I’m happy it’s not me anymore. I just turned 30 years old. I’m not in a position to be leading this industry forward. I have 10 more years before I feel like I could be in that situation.      I feel like a lot of the time the industry looks to the super-young to lead the industry. This isn’t exclusive to crypto, and applies to tech in general, but they’re always looking for child prodigies.      Yeah, but child prodigies don’t know how to be CEOs of companies. They’re brilliant, don’t get me wrong. Look at WeWork, the smartest entrepreneurs are the ones that realize they need to bring on real CEOs. Ledger, BitPay. Even CoinDesk. The companies that have brought on seasoned executives are the ones that are successful. That was my big mistake in 2012, when my investors started bringing on potential CEOs for BitInstant. I was 22 years old and my ego told me that I wanted to run this company. In hindsight I should have stepped back. That was one of my biggest regrets – one of the only regrets – I’ve had my whole life.      That’s a significant learning experience.      I was young and stupid. I thought I could do everything and be the best at everything. My personality prefers when I make my own mistakes to learn lessons, and I definitely learned from the consequences that came after. I like starting small, self sustaining businesses and employing people. This gives me a lot of happiness in life. Im proud to say I started two businesses here in Florida that employ almost a dozen people locally.      What still attracts you to crypto?      I don’t know. It’s my thing. Crypto and bitcoin are my life and legacy. I had no career before bitcoin, except an electronics startup I had in high school. The reason I love bitcoin and crypto is the same reason why you love a baby you’ve raised. If that child turns bad, you’ll still love it. I have an unconditional love for this industry. Even recently when I’ve started to get burnt out.      What’s changed most since you got in?      The narratives are changing, for better or worse. If you look at the story told the past 10 years – that exchanges are too centralized we shouldn't keep money on them – that was the narrative. Now all the distributed exchanges are saying to keep your money on exchanges, ‘you’ll earn staking and interest rates. You can borrow and loan money, so long as you let us hold your money.’ I think that’s a dangerous perspective. I think we need to take a step back, we’re only six years past Mt. Gox. I mean what has changed. Just today UpBit got hacked for $50 million dollars. How many times is this going to happen?      Do you feel a certain responsibility now that your publicly-facing in the media?      I’ve always been public facing, and there was a certain responsibility there, especially with transparency. But now that I'm doing the show I say publicly that I am not a journalist, it’s not a gotcha program, it is purely entertainment. But every aspect is highly produced. I don’t just run on the mic and start talking. I sometimes have people making claims that I can’t verify.      I think the title of the program kind gets to the point – Untold Stories.

42403759,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgcfq,1576843811,Bitcoin Price Set to Outshine Gold and Stocks by Big Margin in 2019,"Bitcoin is on track to end 2019 on a positive note and significantly outperform traditional assets like gold and stocks.      The number one cryptocurrency is currently trading at $7,125, representing a 93 percent gain on a year-to-date basis, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      Prices rose from $3,700 to $13,880 in the first six months likely on the back of halving narrative (a supply cut due in May 2020). Facebook’s launch of cryptocurrency Libra in June further boosted buying.      The frenzy, however, ended in the third quarter with fear gripping the market that Libra might fast track stringent regulation for the entire crypto market. The sell-off was accentuated by miners selling their bitcoin rewards in the final quarter, as noted by crypto market analyst Willy Woo.      At press time, bitcoin is reporting a 48 percent loss from the high of $13,880 seen at the end of June. Prices hit seven-month lows below $6,500 earlier this week.      Despite the H2 downturn, bitcoin's full-year performance is positive, as mentioned above, and the cryptocurrency is outperforming gold and S&P 500 in a big way.      Gold, a classic haven asset, is currently trading at $1,477 per ounce – up 15 percent on a year-to-date basis. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index, a benchmark for risk assets across the globe, is currently reporting a 28 percent gain for 2019. That its the biggest yearly gain since 1997.      Both assets likely benefitted from the U.S. Federal Reserve monetary easing. The central bank delivered three 25-basis-point interest rate cuts in the second half and has expanded its balance sheet by more than $300 billion since mid-September.      While bitcoin's 93-percent yearly gain looks staggering when compared to traditional markets, the number looks slightly less impressive if we take into account the cryptocurrency's historical performance.      Bitcoin has printed gains (green candles) in six years between 2011 and 2019.      The cryptocurrency rallied most – by 5,428 percent and 1,336 percent – in 2013 and 2017, respectively. Further, it gained 189 percent in 2012 and 124 percent in 2016.      This year's 93 percent yearly gain is actually the second-lowest on record, with the lowest rise of 34 percent being registered in 2015.      That said, bitcoin could still end 2019 higher, as the short-term charts are signaling scope for a move to resistance at $7,870.    Daily chart    Bitcoin has charted a series of lower highs and lower lows since July. The last lower high at $7,870 was printed on Nov. 29. A UTC close above that level is needed to confirm a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change.      Bitcoin could rise to that level in the next couple of days, as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has diverged in favor of the bulls. A bullish divergence occurs when an indicator prints higher lows, contradicting lower lows on price, and is considered an early warning of an impending corrective bounce.      Additionally, Wednesday’s big bullish engulfing candle is indicating seller exhaustion.

According to a one-page proposal obtained by CoinDesk, Fortressis offering Mt Gox creditors 70 percent of their account value. Based on the current price of bitcoin, the offer is below a previous proposal issued to creditors in July.      Mt Gox filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after losing a total of more than 850,000 BTC, although 200,000 BTC was subsequently found in an old-format wallet. Last year, Japanese courts changed the case from bankruptcy to a civil rehabilitation case, meaning creditors could now receive the missing bitcoin rather than the cash equivalent – approximately $566 – at the time of the exchange's collapse.      Although a trustee has now been tasked with redistributing the remaining bitcoin, it has been delayed by a series of lawsuits brought against the Mt Gox estate. In its letter, Fortress says the lawsuits ""threaten to delay and dilute distributions of your claim."" It could take between one to two years for an initial ruling, and possibly a further two to three years should the litigants decide to appeal, the letter continues.      Fortress calculated its offer price by multiplying the number of bitcoin an owner lost by 15 percent, the amount available for redistribution to creditors, and then multiplying it again by the present bitcoin price. With the cryptocurrency currently trading at $7,188, Fortress is offering approximately $800 per bitcoin lost.      Fortress had offered creditors $900 per bitcoin lost back in July.      According to the letter, Fortress says it can offer creditors prompt payments within three days in bitcoin or in any fiat currency of choice. The offer stands until Dec. 31.      Fortress has long taken an active interest in the cryptocurrency space, buying more than $20 million worth of bitcoin in the same year Mt Gox collapsed, according to public filings. It was acquired by SoftBank in late 2017.      In September, Mt Gox creditors received another offer from Russian law firm ZP Legal, claiming it could recover 200,000 BTC from unnamed Russian nationals. In return, the firm said it would take between 50 percent and 70 percent of the bitcoin recovered, as well as charge an hourly rate of $320 if successful.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/20/investment-giant-fortress-issues-new-lower-buyout-offer-for-mt-gox-creditor-claims,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2f2ef35ea83700b1df643928e1da29e7342223f5-1500x909.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403758,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgcer,1576836000,Blockstream's 'Watchtowers' Will Bring a New Justice System to the Lightning Network,"Watchtowers, a semi-trusted payment channel sheriff, will keep the peace among lightning nodes. The new feature is likely to be implemented in the coming months.      Spearheaded by Blockstream’s c-lightning team, the Watchtowers are part of Eltoo, a community proposed enforcement layer for the lightning network.      “A Watchtower is basically outsourcing the penalizing of your counterparty to somebody. If something happens, here's a loaded shotgun with which you can go hunt the guy who cheated me,” c-lightning developer Christian Decker said in a phone interview.      Currently, lightning uses fraud proofs to extract justice on the network from channels that steal funds. If a payment channel defrauds its peer, the wronged party can “steal” the perpetrator’s channel funds – all of them. With Eltoo, users who are often offline can defer to Watchtowers to protect their funds for them.      Not altogether a novel concept, the feature has been experimented with by lightning groups Electrum and Lightning Labs, though the implementation will be a first for c-lightning.      Watchtowers were first pushed for on c-lightning by developers Sergi Delgado Segura and Patrick McCorry in late November. Blockstream’s Decker said the feature gained traction as developers worked to make it interoperable with other projects.      As a semi-trusted peacekeeper, Watchtowers store local information from subscribing nodes and are purpose-built for nodes that go offline frequently, such as cell phones, which have quickly become a popular way to participate in the lightning network, Decker said.      “Watchtowers are most important when you run stuff on unreliable network connections, so you maybe cannot check back in with the blockchain to react in time or you have devices that are often offline,” Decker said.      Not everything is in dry ink, however. Watchtowers are expensive to maintain as they store lots of local data, Decker said. Who will operate them remains to be seen, particularly as the lightning fee market remains immature.      Furthermore, its approval largely depends on when Taproot, a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) currently under final review, is accepted, Decker said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/12/20/blockstreams-watchtowers-will-bring-a-new-justice-system-to-the-lightning-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b16f6693c9e1a043197d02dd4870bf24f1ad50d5-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403750,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgcYx,1576832400,Meet the Decentralized Fashion House Bringing Overpriced T-Shirts to Ethereum,"""The secrecy/mystery is what makes it cool,"" Uniswap's Ashleigh Schap said via direct message. ""Normally you wouldn't send $200 to random people who are promising to send you a T-shirt.""      And yet people are doing just that for Saint Fame, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that’s part fashion house, part ethereum subculture.      ""Saint Fame is more like a subreddit with money than a traditional fashion house,"" said Matthew Vernon, a designer involved in the project.      Since announcing itself to the world on Nov. 11, Saint Fame has been intentionally somewhat hard to follow. In its first tweet, the DAO described itself as, “The world's first internet-owned fashion house.”      Fashion and aesthetics have a special place in the ethereum world. Slava Kim, one of the people behind the project who works by day as a designer at Coinbase, told CoinDesk, ""We are excited to enable a new paradigm of collective creation on the internet.""      The DAO currently works by selling a token, FAME, that’s redeemable for one T-shirt. FAME’s price is determined using a bonding curve, basically a smart contract that raises the price of each subsequent token sold at a predictable rate.      There isn't documentation to explain the specific parameters of FAME's bonding curve, but in a Monday tweet the project said the first one sold for $8. If all 100 FAME tokens sell, the final one will go for $170,000, though they have to be purchased in ETH or DAI.      In fact, Saint Fame favors all things ethereum.      Its projects and proposals can be made using Aragon, the governance project. Its smart contracts use OpenZeppelin. The tokens are being sold using a custom integration with Uniswap, the protocol built to swap any two coins on ethereum in one user action.    In fact, the FAME token sale is run on a forkhttps://github.com/Saint-Fame/unishop of an experiment Uniswap has been running called Unisocks, where you can use a token to buy a limited-edition pair of actual socks.    Uniswap built it to show how decentralized exchanges ""enable new use cases and make it easier to bootstrap tokenized products and businesses,"" CEO Hayden Adams said in a statement.    The not-so-lowly T-shirt    The first piece of fashion Saint Fame will create is a T-shirt designed by Vernon, aka Dapp Boi.      ""Expect the design to be a somewhat incoherent explosion of weird internet things,"" Vernon told CoinDesk in an email.      Vernon is a designer at Dharma Labs (another ethereum project), but also an occasional freelancer. For the Saint Fame gig, Vernon was compensated by way of his own custom ERC-20 token, BOI, which represents one hour of his time. (Vernon said Saint Fame acquired eight BOI tokens for his contributions to the project.)      Vernon said the potential of DAOs to enable collaboration among disparate internet users was what drew him to participate. He added that Saint Fame could save fashion fans, such as sneakerheads, some of the pain they experience waiting in line for the hot new thing.      ""[FAME] essentially gives you the ability to speculate on the value of the good in an entirely digital manner,"" Vernon said.      In theory, as the project moves forward, owners of the DAO’s token will be able to vote on the direction its fashion house follows – using Saint Fame's governance token, AINT. These votes happen on Aragon.      “Being involved with this launch has been the most fun thing I have done with Aragon DAOs,” Aragon One CEO Jorge Izquierdo tweeted this week. “After 2 years working on this stack, it is so rewarding to see how everything finally clicks and it is used for something incredible.

42403746,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgcU2,1576821600,Alleged 'Dark Overlord' Hacker Gang Member Extradited to US,"A British national has been extradited to the U.S. for his alleged participation in “The Dark Overlord” hacker group that stole data from several Missouri companies and demanded ransom paid in bitcoin.      Nathan Wyatt, appearing in St. Louis’ Federal District Court Wednesday, pleaded not guilty to charges he damaged a protected computer and other counts in his efforts to extort the companies.      He is an alleged member of the international hacker collective known as “The Dark Overlord.” That group came to prominence through brazen attacks on healthcare organizations and insurance companies, including a data dump of 9/11-linked insurance files in late 2018 and early 2019.      In the Missouri case, The Dark Overlord group reportedly stole some 48,000 patient documents – Social Security numbers, dates of birth, names, addresses – from a Farmington medical facility.      The group demanded a ransom; the facility refused to pay, Health IT Security reported. The Dark Overlord proceeded to offer the records for sale on the dark web for $100,000.      Wyatt is alleged to have participated in The Dark Overlord’s Missouri extortions. He is said to have created the email and phone accounts that sent threatening messages to targets, and in some cases their family members.      “Cyber criminals who harm victims in the Eastern District of Missouri cannot hide behind international borders to evade justice,” said U.S. Attorney Jeffrey B. Jensen of the Eastern District of Missouri. “Today’s case demonstrates the United States’ commitment to unmasking criminal hackers and bringing them to justice, no matter where they may be located.”",NEGATIVE,없음,OTHER,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/12/20/alleged-dark-overlord-hacker-gang-member-extradited-to-us,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2745e571d05aa76a62e0c6ba6d3a2d04f2b83121-1000x719.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The companies announced on Friday that a new set of derivatives contracts, including swaps, would help miners manage their risks when running operations in 2020, including the upcoming bitcoin halving (when the amount of bitcoin produced per block mined is cut in half).      The new products are expected to launch next month, though a specific date was not provided.      According to a press release, some $3 billion in bitcoin is expected to be mined next year at current price levels.      Rich Rosenblum, GSR co-founder, told CoinDesk that the companies were specifically offering two products: “a tailored risk management solution for miners,” which provides an average-priced option or swap contract, and a new type of futures contract that trades based on hashrate.      “In a general sense if it’s hashrate-related it can either have physical delivery, delivering your spot hashrate via a proxy, or if it’s a forward market,” he said. “You can deliver bitcoin or you can deliver hashrate.”      Hash rate can be delivered physically by using mining equipment as collateral for the contract, he said as one example. In a follow-up email, a spokesperson added that hashes which correspond to bitcoin-producing blocks could also be delivered, allowing the recipient to claim the mining reward.      GSR would look to third-party data providers to detail what the actual hash rate on the bitcoin network or a difficulty derivative would be.      However, this second type of derivative is not yet ready to be rolled out, he said.      “We already have some of these new products ready but … the second is in a test phase and a work in progress,” he said.      In a statement, GSR co-founder Cristian Gil said the factors miners must consider include price, mining equipment costs, electricity costs and mining difficulty, but at present companies do not hedge “against adverse price action.”      “The unpredictability of their business models is unprecedented, so it is natural that this segment of the market is exploring ways to better hedge their risk,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | MINING | SPONSORED | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/20/gsr-partners-with-canaan-tied-startup-to-offer-crypto-miners-derivatives,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/579e9f1512b3b863c9563825d36058e64e1dd02a-1000x668.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
