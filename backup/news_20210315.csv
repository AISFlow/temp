42433919,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6Xnh,1615851641,BitMEX Founder Ben Delo Surrenders to US Authorities,"One of the founders of the cryptocurrency derivatives exchange BitMEX surrendered to U.S. authorities to face charges of violating the Bank Secrecy Act on Monday.      Ben Delo traveled from the U.K. to the U.S. and appeared before Magistrate Judge Sarah L. Cave in a remote proceeding where he pleaded not guilty, according to public court records.      He was subsequently released on a $20 million bail bond, on Monday, with a status conference set for May, according to court records. Bloomberg further reported that Delo will be allowed to return to the U.K. under the terms of his bail.      Delo, with BitMEX co-founders Arthur Hayes and Samuel Reed, were charged with violating the BSA and conspiracy to violate the BSA last October by the U.S. Department of Justice and Commodity Futures Trading Commission.      BitMEX's first employee, Gregory Dwyer, was also charged.      Under the BSA, financial institutions are required to provide documentation to regulators with transactions above $10,000. Its stated purpose is to prevent criminals from laundering large sums of cash at banks and elsewhere.      “The charges against Ben are unfounded and represent unwarranted overreach by the U.S. authorities,” Rachel Miller, a spokesperson for Delo, told Bloomberg. “Ben intends to defend himself against the charges and clear his name in court.”      See also: BitMEX Founder Arthur Hayes May Surrender to US Law Enforcement Next Month      Earlier this month, Jessica Greenwood, an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said she had been in talks with Hayes' lawyers. Court documents show Greenwood claimed to ""have discussed with counsel how to arrange for a voluntary surrender"" for Hayes and for an agreement to appear remotely or come to New York ""as needed.""      Reed was arrested last year and subsequently released on bond.

42433920,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6Xjh,1615842852,"The Brooklyn Bridge Is Actually for Sale, an NFT of It Anyway","Turns out George C. Parker was simply ahead of his time. One really can buy the Brooklyn Bridge ... or at least a digitized rendering of it.      Parker, a renowned con man, ""sold"" the bridge that links the New York City boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn numerous times to unsuspecting immigrants around the turn of the 20th century. His exploits grew to be so famous that the saying, ""If you believe that, I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you"" is now a standard way of calling someone gullible.      Now, in an apparent homage to Parker, someone is trying to sell the rights to a virtual representation, a so-called non-fungible token (NFT), of that famous bridge. A performance artist known as gcp-nyc (note the initials) has listed on auction site OpenSea an NFT of what appears to be a Google Maps view of the iconic structure.      Parker would likely have been in awe of the concept of NFTs, and the thought that people can make fortunes simply by selling digitized pictures of items or events that anyone can view on the internet for free. That a piece of digital artwork last week sold for $69.3 million would have surely reduced him to tears.      The people Parker duped into ""buying"" the Brooklyn Bridge at least thought they were purchasing the physical structure and all the rights associated with it; indeed, some tried to set up tolls upon it. Meanwhile, anyone buying an NFT is buying bragging rights but little else. The property represented by the NFT doesn't change hands.      ""Know ye that this tokenized object entitles the holder to the representation of the Brooklyn Bridge depicted herein.,"" says the retro listing.      Half the auction proceeds would go to the Brooklyn Public Library, assuming the unspecified minimum is met. While it's unknown whether Parker would have approved of such a charitable allocation, clearly he would have appreciated the chutzpah the sale represents.      Bidding ends April 11. Given that ""Bridge for sale"" was going for 0.015 ether (about USD$26.53) at press time, it's doubtful buying this NFT will require anyone to take out a bridge loan.",NEUTRAL,없음,OTHER,Kevin Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/15/the-brooklyn-bridge-is-actually-for-sale-an-nft-of-it-anyway,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a2f684d4cba9861f5730dedc04f0f7dbca6a6e3d-1000x489.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421777,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXprMz,1615840039,5 Legal Considerations When Dealing in NFTs,"Recently, I’ve been getting a ton of inbound relating to non-fungible tokens, or NFTs.  For those of you living under a rock, an NFT is an object, on a decentralized system such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, designed to be sui generis, i.e., unique. This is in contradistinction to cryptocurrency tokens, where one unit of cryptocurrency is ostensibly no different from any other, much like one U.S. dollar is ostensibly no different from any other.  Preston Byrne, a CoinDesk columnist, is a partner in Anderson Kill's Technology, Media and Distributed Systems Group. He advises software, internet and fintech companies. His biweekly column, “Not Legal Advice,” is a roundup of pertinent legal topics in the crypto space. It is most definitely not legal advice.  When I buy a coffee with bitcoin, the shopkeeper doesn’t inquire about individual UTXOs (at least, not for the moment, although proposals to blacklist stolen coins could change that). All that matters is the coins land in his wallet and rack up a half-dozen confirmations. With NFTs the opposite is true: The provenance of the asset and its chain-of-title matters, and it matters forever.  As a result, legal thinking needs to be applied not only to NFT systems as a whole (much as it has been for the past several years when cryptocurrency developers seek out legal opinions as to the status of their blockchain systems) but also to individual NFT assets and the manner of sale of those assets.  See also: Jeff Wilser - How NFTs Became Art, and Everything Became an NFT  Where early NFT experiments like CryptoKitties simply ignored these formalities and people bought the tokens anyway, new platforms are bringing increasing degrees of commercial, technical and legal sophistication to their products.  Here are five things worth considering. It goes without saying, this is not legal advice and I’m not your lawyer. But these might form a good jumping-off point for discussion with your lawyers as you build your offerings.  NFTs aren’t necessarily securities …  The NFT craze hearkens back to the heady days of the initial coin offering boom in 2017. ICOs allowed blockchain entrepreneurs to pre-sell coins on networks not yet built. Although the theory of these offerings was that the tokens were collectibles or commodities – one prominent project referred to its pre-sold tokens as a “tote bag,” another described its as being akin to “fuel” – the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission took issue with many projects that followed this fundraising template. As the Telegram and Kik cases and the recently announced Ripple Labs enforcement action, make plain, pre-selling cryptocurrency tokens in the United States is not, legally speaking, a good idea.  NFTs, on the other hand, are collectibles. Legally this means they are easier to distinguish from “investment contracts” of the sort that get captured by securities laws.  The reason schemes like Ripple Labs' have been caught within the U.S. SEC’s regulatory perimeter are because they allegedly satisfy the three prongs of the test in SEC v Howey. There is an investment of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits arising from the efforts of a promoter or third party. The reason this rule does not apply to, say, a gold eagle dollar or a Magic: the Gathering card is due to the absence of a common enterprise and the absence of an expectation of profit arising from the efforts of promoters or third parties.  … but NFTs can become securities or other regulated products  Let’s take a royalty contract, for example. Alice the Author wants to sell NFT-signed e-books of her popular young adult literature. She approaches Norman, the NFT platform operator, if he can make one for her. Norman agrees to do so if he can split 50% of the profits of the initial sale and get a 5% cut of all secondary market sales thereafter. Alice and Norman sign a contract and the NFT is sold to Bob, who sells it to Carol.  Without more, there is not an obvious reason that either the royalty contract, the sale to Bob or the sale to Carol should constitute an investment contract (and therefore a security). The royalty contract is a private profit-sharing agreement. The sale to Bob looks a lot like any other consumer transaction. Bob’s sale to Carol, similarly, is a private sale of a consumer good.  See also: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?  Alice could, however, inadvertently turn a non-security into a security if she tries to be too clever about monetization. For example, if Alice fractionalized the NFT and sold fractions of a book or profits from one, that might fall foul of the securities laws.  Similarly, if Alice made an NFT that was the beneficiary of cash flows from other NFTs, that would almost certainly be a security. Also, if Alice represented that the value of the NFT would go up as a result of efforts Alice was planning to undertake to make the NFT useful as part of an online platform yet to be built – in other words the “utility token” argument from 2017 – that also could move Alice’s NFT from unregulated territory into regulated territory.  An NFT that performs the function of a regulated product will be regulated like a regulated product. Changing the name of the thing to “NFT” isn’t enough to not apply financial services laws, any more than changing “IPO” to “ICO” was back in the day.  Know what you’re buying  Purchasers of NFTs should ask sellers what they’re getting in exchange for their money.  Depending on the functionality the NFT promises to deliver those questions will vary, but might include the following: Who is your counterparty? Who is obliged to render performance to you and what are they obliged to do? How do you enforce those rights and in what forum? Are you buying an original artwork, an image of an artwork, a right to make derivatives of an artwork or a right to display an artwork?  Are you buying information, copyrights, bragging rights or none or all of those things? Do you have the documentation to back all of that up?  Lawyers can help you parse what questions need to be asked for particular kinds of tokens. Ignoring these questions could result in significant financial or legal pain down the road, so it’s best not to ignore them today.  Just because securities laws might not apply doesn’t mean other laws won’t  NFTs may be the Wild West of crypto, but this is not a lawless frontier – and failing to structure a consumer product correctly can land entrepreneurs in hot water.  It goes without saying, don’t lie. Don’t engage in deceptive trade practices. Don’t sell goods you don’t have. Don’t sell rights you don’t own. Don’t infringe on third-party intellectual property. Make sure you have the proper documentation to back what you’re selling. Don’t use NFTs to launder money, don’t sell NFTs to North Koreans and don’t sell NFTs that obviously pertain to the commission of, or could facilitate, crime.  Platforms that sell legally enforceable rights are more likely to succeed in the long term  A further problem with current NFT proposals is that in the mad rush to issue the tokens to eager purchasers, legal corners will be cut.  In one recent case, as part of an elaborate troll, an artist selling NFTs on OpenSea swapped out modern artwork for pictures of oriental rugs. The artist’s point was a simple, but important, one: Just because you have an entry on a database doesn’t mean that you have anything more than that. Just because an NFT seller is selling you an NFT that is associated with a painting doesn’t mean that you’re buying rights in that painting.  It is, of course, possible for NFTs to represent ownership in some underlying asset or artwork. It is possible, by contract, to transfer exclusive rights of ownership or to define the terms on which a creative work, whether written, drawn or coded, is licensed to an NFT holder.  Few platforms seem to be doing the legal legwork necessary to convey valuable rights together with their tokens. My suspicion is legally enforceable copyrights and hard-coded, on-chain monetization mechanisms will be a valued feature for NFT platforms, and the platforms with the most effective monetization schemes will attract the most in-demand content creators (and therefore the best content).  Moving up a layer in the stack, hardware devices and ad platforms could then be built to interact with these content networks and automatically pay creators license fees for their work. That way consumers are insulated from liability and creators know they will be paid for their work. Image aggregators like Getty and copyright enforcement law firms stand to lose big.  That’s why the NFT space is interesting to me, and why it should be interesting to you, too.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Preston J.

Sliding 5.30% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $54,790.33-$60,695.91 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades between its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin on Monday suffered its biggest single-day price decline in more than two weeks, after the fizzing of a retail trader-driven rally over the weekend that analysts said was notable for its lack of participation by institutional investors.      At press time, bitcoin’s price was changing hands around $56,671.15 after it tumbled to $54,790.33 during Asian trading hours earlier Monday, down 11% from Saturday's record high at $61,556.59.      Read more: Nearly $40B in US Stimulus Checks May Be Spent on Bitcoin and Stocks: Mizuho Survey      “This sell-off happened right around the start of trading hours in Asian capital markets,” John Willock, chief executive at digital asset exchange Blocktane, said. “So it is likely that traders there repositioned themselves for the start of the week, post run-up.”      According to data from crypto derivatives analytics site Skew, bitcoin futures open interest on major retail platforms reached new all-time highs over the weekend. On the institution-driven CME’s bitcoin futures contract, however, open interest was lower compared with levels at the end of February, when bitcoin’s price pierced $58,000 for the first time.      “The fresh all-time high on Saturday above $60,000, coupled with the closure of traditional markets that has recently kept bitcoin yoked, meant a hopeful chase by retail participants,” Singapore-based quant firm QCP Capital wrote in its weekly market update on March 15. Funding rates on bitcoin perpetual futures – the fees traders pay for the leverage embedded within the trading instruments – rose to 200% on an annualized basis, considered an “unsustainable” level, according to QCP.      The lack of support from institutional investors in the recent rally was also apparent from the so-called Coinbase premium. The indicator, as tracked by the South Korean blockchain data-analysis firm CryptoQuant, measures the spread between Coinbase’s BTC/USD pair and Binance’s BTC/USDT pair. Over the weekend, it went negative, implying weak institutional demand.      Read more: DeFi Projects Cream Finance, PancakeSwap Hit With ‘DNS Hijacks’      That dynamic contrasted with the apparent surge in institutional participation during a rally last month.      After bitcoin broke above key psychological levels at $30,000 in January and $50,000 in February, the Coinbase premium saw huge jumps, showing a strong follow-up demand from institutions, according to Du Jun, co-founder of crypto exchange Huobi.      Trading volume during the rally over the past few days was muted, based on data from eight major spot crypto exchanges tracked by CoinDesk. It was nothing like the surge in volume that came with last month’s price swings.    Ether fails to break $2K as ether-bitcoin ratio drops    Ether (ETH) was down on Monday, trading around $1,789.53 and sliding 4.13% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      The No. 2 cryptocurrency by market capitalization is still largely driven by bitcoin’s price action.      The ether-to-bitcoin ratio dropped to near 0.030 since the weekend, after it rose to 0.046 in the beginning of February, the highest since August 2018.

On the derivatives market, ether futures contracts open interest on major exchanges – although higher to around $6.3 billion – was not nearly as high as the $7.1 billion level during ether’s last big rally to about $2,000.

42433926,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6Xzh,1615839183,"ConsenSys Confidential: Ethereum Builder Is Back in Growth Mode, Document Reveals","Buoyed by a crypto bull market, and with a helping hand from JPMorgan, there’s light at the end of the tunnel for employees and startup builders who were promised share options in ConsenSys, the Brooklyn, N.Y.-based Ethereum hub.      With last year’s restructuring of ConsenSys into two separate entities now done, the part of the business that’s been awaiting inclusion in an equity program – ConsenSys Mesh – is now going to be onboarded, according to documents seen by CoinDesk.      “Now that we have streamlined and restructured the management and operations at Mesh and done an extensive review of our strategy for Mesh equity, we are currently employed with external lawyers and accountants to operationalize the Mesh equity plan as soon as possible,” states the confidential ConsenSys document, dated March 8, 2021.      (Employees related to the other entity created from the business, ConsenSys Software Inc., or CSI, were included in an equity plan after the spinout of the new company last year. The next update for “Meshers” will be at the end of this month, the document adds.)      The cryptocurrency space is exploding right now, whether it’s non-fungible tokens (NFTs) being auctioned for millions, or decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms lending out billions, or the price of bitcoin touching all-time highs above $60,000. ETH is currently trading hands near $1,800.      But all this froth is a far cry from the crypto winter of 2018-19, from which ConsenSys has emerged a good deal leaner and potentially stronger than before. At its peak the company had over 1,200 employees; that figure is about 600 now.    Read more: ConsenSys May Finally Fix Its ‘Chaotic’ Employee Equity Situation    Emulating to some degree the ethos of decentralization, ConsenSys started out as a hub in New York City helmed by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, with projects spread out around the world like spokes branching out from the center of a wheel.      In 2017, ConsenSys granted equity to several dozen employees. There also appears to have been handshake agreements made, and a growing air of uncertainty as to who would get what as ConsenSys grew to become an “incredibly complex, high-burn organization,” according to the document.      Reports about anxious and disgruntled employees seeking their promised share in the company began to emerge in 2019.    Split the difference    The internal ConsenSys document provides an interesting view into the restructuring of the sprawling Ethereum studio.      In 2020, ConsenSys split into two companies. ConsenSys AG (rebranded as ConsenSys Mesh) became a home for all the firm’s investments, incubated projects, ongoing software work, R&D and accelerator activities.      A new Delaware corporation was also created, the aforementioned CSI, focused on infrastructure, developer tools, fintech and enterprise-related services. This is the business that includes MetaMask, the wallet that serves as a gateway for many to the $43 billion DeFi sector.      The complexity of the original company, ConsenSys AG, made it hard to drum up investment. Some investors wanted to invest in the venture side of the business, others wanted to invest in the software business but nobody wanted to invest in both, the document said.      The idea of splitting the company in two was not taken lightly, but was well received by potential investors, the document states. At the time the restructuring was even referred to as ConsenSys 2.0.    Read more: New Layoffs Hit Ethereum Incubator ConsenSys    Amid the onset of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, the wheels of the CSI spin-out were set in motion, and later that year a term sheet was secured from JPMorgan to back the new product and enterprise-focused venture.      JPMorgan led a $50 million capital raise, and the bank itself made a strategic $20 million investment in ConsenSys, according to anonymous sources reported by The Block last year.      A source within ConsenSys told CoinDesk the next installment of that fundraising is soon to be announced, and that the raise is higher than the figure The Block reported.      Quorum, JPMorgan’s privacy-centric fork of Ethereum aimed at banks and financial institutions, became part of CSI in August. In terms of JPMorgan’s percentage share of the ConsenSys entity, this was worked out based on a valuation of Quorum plus the money the bank put in.      JPMorgan declined to comment for this article.      In addition, CSI acquired certain software assets from ConsenSys AG at prices determined and vetted by external valuation experts and relevant local authorities, according to the document.      Through the transaction, Mesh became the second-largest shareholder in CSI (after JPMorgan), “additionally receiving significant non-equity consideration in the transaction in the form of a very material debt cancellation,” the document said.      Asked to elaborate on this part of the transaction, James Beck, director of communications and content at ConsenSys, said the terms are confidential at this point.      “We are working on creating an inverse arrangement between CSI and Mesh to further cement the alignment of these two institutions,” the document said. “As Mesh is a large shareholder in CSI, all Mesh shareholders will share in the success of CSI.”    The Coinbase effect    The evolving value of ConsenSys, and the distribution of that value, provides an interesting contrast with Coinbase, soon to list with a predicted $100 billion price tag.      “We recognize that the value proposition is different at Mesh than it is for traditional Web 2.0 tech companies that hope to [go public] within several years,” the document states.      The rationale in pulling together CSI was to create a unified software stack, spanning public Ethereum and DeFi applications with the permissioned enterprise space, explained Beck.      The missing pieces that have been added are developer tooling suite Truffle, ConsenSys Quorum and decentralized exchange (DEX) AirSwap. With those parts in place, new features were built, such as swaps within MetaMask, the widely used Ethereum wallet.    Read more: MetaMask Gets Into the Decentralized Exchange Aggregation Business With Token Swaps    “Now, MetaMask has a product revenue stream because we take a small percentage on these swaps for providing simplified aggregation of data from applications and liquidity providers,” Beck said in an interview, adding that cumulative volume recently surpassed $1 billion.      As such, ConsenSys is moving from being mainly a consulting and services company towards being one focused on product revenue.      “The product revenue part is important because if you look at the valuation of Coinbase, they have this recurring revenue product, which in their case is fees on trades,” said Beck.      The ConsenSys Mesh side of things now has a manageable balance sheet and a range of investments in blue chip-crypto assets, such as BlockFi, Gnosis, ErisX, 3Box and Compound, said the document.      “Meanwhile, markets have done great,” Beck added. “So all of a sudden, these companies in our portfolio on the Mesh side and all those bets made early on [in] the application side of things like OpenLaw, Treum and Gitcoin, are all flourishing in their own way.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/15/consensys-confidential-ethereum-builder-is-back-in-growth-mode-document-reveals,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5141f97a9d09892a2d443395cc65a53943b52786-1420x946.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433929,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP6Y1h,1615833969,The Node: Crypto Doesn't Pay,"I like the classic definition of money. It makes sense: method of payment, way to store value and unit of account. That all seems pretty smart.      But I also like the way I defined money when I got my first wages at a Southeast Kansas J.C. Penney's department store in the 90s: Money was what my time turned into when I let someone else tell me how to use it.    This article is excerpted from The Node (formerly Blockchain Bites), CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Also known as a paycheck.      This is, in fact, the way I think most everyone I know in fact defines money (as we know, hardly anyone really thinks about it).      So, to me, crypto isn't really money yet because the cryptocurrency industry isn't doing a very good job paying people wages. It's barely even trying.    Buterin’s bootstrapping    In Camila Russo's readable and entertaining book on the origins of Ethereum, ""The Infinite Machine,"" we meet a young Vitalik Buterin before he could even really code. Baby Buterin was fascinated by Bitcoin and the possibility of money native to the internet, and he wanted some.      But he was so young! He didn't have money of his own to speak of and he definitely didn't have access to the fiat on-ramps of the internet, like a credit card. So, Buterin started asking around to see if there was some actual work he could do. It turned out that the best way for Vitalik to earn some BTC was to write useful explanations about the technology. Eventually this work would lead him to founding Bitcoin Magazine.      There's a larger lesson there. It's not really money until people can get it in a paycheck of some kind.      For crypto, wages would create an additional benefit: people could get into its economy and completely sidestep the traditional financial system.    Machine work    A certain kind of crypto denizen will have been reading the last few paragraphs and thinking something along these lines: In its earliest days, turning work into crypto was no problem. A technically adept user could run the Bitcoin software on a PC and earn a steady stream of bitcoin. The same went for Ethereum for a long time, as well.      Those heady days are long past, though.      Others have come along to make similar promises but the facts don't live up to the hype. I recently reported that the forthcoming Chia might be the easiest cryptocurrency for normal people to mine, but that weekend I tried to join the testnet and check out that claim. It went badly.      But honestly, mining is beside the point. Staking and mining are only ""work"" in the most abstract sense, not in the way that real people, people who think in paycheck terms, think about work.      Work – in the minds of enough people that it's not really worth arguing the point – is human time for hire.    Crossing the chasm    If crypto wants to cross the chasm with regular folks, it needs to provide more ways for people to earn it with actual work. I'm not talking about full-on jobs. It's too soon for that. What's missing is a place for side-hustles that earn crypto, like what Vitalik did in writing helpful blog posts via crowdsourced commission.      We saw some hints of that kind of economy in August when one of our contributors presented the story of Filipino grandmas playing Axie Infinity for far too many hours each day. That one was more than a little dystopian, obviously, and not, I'm pretty sure, anything Axie really had in mind when it built the game.      The blogging sites Steem, Hive and Cent have also paid creators for content to some degree, but that's also just one kind of work. More are needed.      There must be ways to connect talented people around the world with people who need work done. Folks with skills like copyediting and design, who have time for a little side work, can earn additional income on marketplaces such as Fiverr, and it's cool to see there is some demand there for a crypto payment option. EthLance and FreelanceforCoins are nice starts down that road.      But it doesn't feel like these are as crypto as they could be.      One idea: What about a crowdsourced meme factory? Imagine: a founder could post a message a company wanted to get across and invite memesters to submit concepts. Each memester would have a reputation score, and everyone who submitted would get paid something for taking part, but those with better reputations would earn slightly more (and the ones with bad track records would earn nothing).      Then a few memes would get voted up by other users, earning more, until the founder picked however many the team wanted to use on Crypto Twitter or wherever, and each of those selected would get the real payday.      Boom.      An actual economy.      Side note: I'm sure everything above raises all kinds of legal and tax issues, particularly in the U.S., whose regulators are determined to keep the online world as dull as possible. No doubt, no doubt. But look, I'm a writer, not an attorney nor a founder, and those issues make me very sleepy. Regardless, the larger point stands.      Until crypto finds ways to get over any and all obstacles to regular people turning time into money, it will remain an industry that exists somewhere down the rabbit hole.",NEGATIVE,BTC,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINING,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/15/the-node-crypto-doesnt-pay,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0cac2cd92f6b9b8e099bc726093afccb05ed79b9-2560x1714.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386185,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBRhGt,1615829119,'Shark Tank' Star: Wall Street Investors Need to Know How Their BTC Is Mined,"Not all bitcoins are created equal in the eyes of institutional investors, according to “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary.      Institutions want greater transparency about where and how bitcoin is mined, raising the prospect that only some of the supply will end up in Wall Street custody, O’Leary said Monday on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover.”      Also known as “Mr Wonderful,” O’Leary has changed his mind about bitcoin as an asset class, now weighting BTC at 3% of his personal portfolio. But he said he doesn’t want to buy bitcoin mined in a way that causes energy waste and environmental damage.      “I want to make sure my coin is mined efficiently,” he said, comparing dirty bitcoin to “blood diamonds” that finance unsavory activities in the developing world. Such desire among investors could preclude buying bitcoin mined in China, for instance, which is known for powering its mining with coal-derived electricity (though also hydroelectric plants during the rainy season).      O’Leary’s comments suggest the recent influx of traditional investors to the bitcoin market could revive an old debate, though for new reasons.      For years, there has been talk of newly mined, “virgin” bitcoins fetching a premium over units that have passed through multiple wallets. Supposedly, buyers wanted to avoid any taint from coins that may have been used in illicit darknet marketplaces.      If true, this would mean bitcoin is not truly fungible, or interchangeable, meaning it lacks one of the fundamental properties of money. However, evidence of virgin bitcoin premium has been largely anecdotal, and many market participants have called the idea dubious.      If O’Leary is right, however, Wall Street’s environmental conscience – or at least, its desire to project one – could lead to a new differentiation between supposedly fungible coins.    Sustainability committees    The founder of a mutual fund company, a venture capital firm and an exchange-traded fund (ETF), O’Leary noted that many institutions have two committees deciding on asset allocations these days: an investment committee and a sustainability committee.      Bitcoin needs to satisfy stakeholders on both before companies are going to jump in, he argued.      “I don’t think the community realizes how big this issue is going to become,” he said.      O’Leary said he plans to be active in the mining space, partnering with miners that want to reduce their carbon footprint.      He predicted that some institutions may want to mine their own BTC so as to assure provenance for their clients.      According to O’Leary, only 10% of people at financial institutions who want to invest in the premier cryptocurrency have done so yet, suggesting big unmet demand and rising future prices.

One Twitter user claims to have lost more than $150,000 worth of NFTs.  Another Twitter user claims to have had his credit card information used to purchase more than $10,000 in NFTs. He also says his pre-purchased NFTs have been stolen.  In its statement Nifty said, “Our analysis is ongoing but our initial assessment indicates that the impact was limited, none of the impacted accounts had 2FA enabled, and access was obtained via valid account credentials.”  Two-factor authentication (2FA) is not currently mandatory on Nifty Gateway, but that may be changing. 2FA is an extra layer of security that forces someone to provide two pieces of evidence proving his or her identity when trying to access an online account. Usually it comes in the form of a password and a unique code for one-time use.  “A few users were targeted and got their passwords compromised,” said Nifty Gateway co-founder Griffin Cock Foster on Twitter. “In the meantime, make sure you have Authy 2fa turned on, it would have prevented this!! We are strongly exploring making Authy 2fa mandatory for anyone who has made a purchase, but no commitments there yet.”  NFTs have exploded in popularity in recent months, with one piece of digital artwork by the artist Beeple selling for $69.3M in ETH on Friday.

At press time, Bybit accounts for $3.53 billion, or 16.1%, of the global bitcoin-futures open interest of $21.2 billion, according to data source Skew. That share of the market puts Bybit just behind No. 1 Binance’s 17.5%.      Bybit, which has offices across Asia, has registered solid growth over the past five months and more so this year. The exchange ranked sixth on the list of biggest bitcoin futures exchanges in October and fifth in early January. Bybit's client profile is about 70% retail and 30% institutional, the exchange's spokesperson told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.      ""We have to recognize the overall bull market as a key factor, and we certainly prepared ourselves well in taking advantage of it by increasing our server capacity and building in redundancy,"" the spokesperson said. ""When large volume came with sudden spikes/volatility, we managed to execute orders as usual while many other exchanges experienced downtime.""      The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), seen as more heavily focused on institutional trading activity, now ranks fourth below OKEx, after holding the top position in late December and January.      The change in the leaderboard suggests institutional activity has cooled in this quarter, while retail participation has picked up. The spot market activity paints a similar picture. According to JPMorgan, retail investors have purchased over 187,000 BTC so far this quarter and institutions have accumulated 173,000 BTC.

In a letter to Sunak, shared on the group's website, CryptoUK Chairman Ian Taylor says the U.K. is ""missing out on a major opportunity” as crypto companies trying to sign up under the new regulatory regime experience an “arduous process” and with most of the group's members having received little or no response from the FCA.      So far, only four out of 200 applications have received a decision, claimed Taylor, adding, ""For some, more than eight months have elapsed without a single response from the regulator.""      With the FCA having become an anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing supervisor of businesses last January, it brought in the MLR scheme requiring crypto-asset businesses to become compliant and to register to continue trading.      In December, the FCA acknowledged a backlog of applications from crypto firms that were already trading, extending the deadline for applications to be approved until July 9, 2021.      “The clock is again ticking as we approach the new July deadline, whereby existing firms legally have to cease trading,"" writes Taylor. ""Additionally, hundreds of new businesses have been waiting for months to progress their applications, with staff and overhead costs mounting, as they cannot start trading and earning revenues until their [applications have] been approved.”      The ongoing situation threatens to benefit larger organizations with the funding to ""wait the process out,"" he wrote, warning that some businesses may either leave the U.K. or cease trading, which would be a blow for the U.K. economy.

42386196,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBRhTT,1615817100,Nigerians Turn to Stablecoins for Protection Against Inflation,"Okeke Leticia Chigozie, a 28-year-old Nigerian logistics worker, dreams of opening her own shoe store in Nigeria. Having no credit history, she does not qualify for a bank loan to fund her enterprise. Instead, she joined a traditional savings group in her community, sometimes called esusu. These savings circles allow those without access to traditional banking services to save money and acquire loans or credit.      The problem is that in inflationary countries like Nigeria and Zimbabwe, the value of savings could plummet. Stablecoins – cryptocurrencies pegged to a strong fiat currency like the U.S. dollar or a basket of assets to keep their prices stable – could be a solution to Leticia’s problem.      “Devaluation is a problem because if you check the last two years, 20,000 naira doesn’t really have a lot of value now,” Leticia said. “What if I can actually invest this money somewhere or probably save it somewhere and the value doesn’t go down? Then I can use it for something better. Why not?”      Dollar stablecoins have become a compelling option for individuals and businesses in markets facing local currency volatility and hyperinflation, according to Josh Hawkins, senior vice president of marketing at Circle. In Argentina, another inflationary economy, people are increasingly turning to DAI, a stablecoin backed by the U.S. dollar, after the government imposed restrictions on the amount of dollars citizens could purchase.      “We've seen growing demand for digital dollars, especially over the past 12 months,” Hawkins told CoinDesk via an email.    Untapped market    Traditional savings groups, large and small, play a vital role in providing savings and credit opportunities to millions of people, not just in Nigeria but across the African continent. In Africa, around 350 million adults do not have bank accounts, according to the World Bank. Globally, the unbanked are disproportionately female and poor, and savings circles are mostly formed and run by women. In 2018, in South Africa alone, 11 million people were part of traditional savings groups (called skovels) and saved around $3 billion.      “I’m a low-income earner. Most of the people who join these African traditional savings groups are low-income earners,” Leticia said.      A small esusu, like the one Leticia joined, is made up of around 12 or more friends, colleagues or neighbors. The members periodically contribute a fixed portion of their earnings to a communal fund. Leticia contributes around 20,000 Nigerian naira ($41) monthly. After collection, the total sum is given to one member of the group on a rotational basis, which means each member of the group has a chance to access the full fund, without interest. To join the group, Leticia didn’t need to have a credit history or a bank account. Someone from the group just had to vouch for her.      Often, the funds that are collected are redistributed as they are, without any value increase. In fact, a 2017 study conducted in Ghana, Malawi and Uganda showed that although community savings groups helped boost the number and longevity of businesses created in villages, they did not increase total household income or food security.    Digitizing savings funds    Aronu Ugochukwu, CEO of fintech firm Xend Finance, said he created a platform that serviced African traditional savings groups because his mother, a professor of medicine, belonged to one. Growing up, every few months his mother would say, “This is my month.”      “And every time she said it's her month, she got a huge sum of money. So that's what she used to buy a car, or maybe pay for a big project,” Ugochukwu said.      Ugochukwu is introducing community cooperatives and credit unions to stablecoins. Through Xend, community savings groups and larger credit unions in Nigeria will have the opportunity to maintain the value of their savings and even earn higher yields by converting their funds to stablecoins like USDC backed by the U.S. dollar, Ugochukwu added.      To create Xend Finance, he partnered with TechFusion, a digital platform that helps credit unions and savings groups to manage their funds. TechFusion is one of many fintech firms coming in to digitize the informal savings sector in Nigeria.      “We're not changing what they are used to doing. We're just improving it, giving them more access to the international money markets,” Ugochukwu told CoinDesk.      But most of these savings funds are informal, he said. For context, Nigeria’s informal “cash” economy accounts for around 64% of its GDP. According to Ugochukwu, many larger informal credit unions use middlemen to manage funds that earn very low yields of around 1%.      “There's a lot of fraud going on there between the source and then the end users. So we've been trying to solve that problem,” Ugochukwu said.      But it’s not just about improving financial inclusion by giving people the technology to access financial services but digging into the root cause of this problem, which is low income, Matthew Okwe, CEO of TechFusion told CoinDesk.      You can always connect people to a bank when you open an account for them but if they don’t have money to put in the bank, that account is useless, he added. In fact, despite Nigeria adding 8.1 million new bank accounts in 2019, there were 45.57 million dormant or inactive accounts, according to local reports.      “What they basically need is to improve on their income opportunities. Once we are able to help them grow their income sustainably then giving them technology to manage, that process makes a lot of sense,” Okwe said.    Enter stablecoins    Leticia hasn’t really heard of many opportunities to increase her savings.      “You know, when you don't have so much you wouldn't really be hearing about or getting a whole lot,” Leticia said.      But if there was an opportunity for her to avoid devaluation and invest her money in something better, she said she’d be open to trying it.      “Because as it is, when it’s your turn and you take your money, you may not really have anything worthy in mind to spend it on or actually invest in, so the money becomes useless and you might end up spending it either way. So if there is a way to invest it in something stable, I’d like it very well,” Leticia said.      Opening aspiring entrepreneurs like Leticia to stablecoin investments is not impossible. According to the World Bank, the major driver of financial inclusion in sub-Saharan Africa has been mobile money accounts, or cash tied to an account on a mobile phone. Vodafone’s M-Pesa, for example, is one of the largest mobile money services in Africa, with around 40 million users across the continent.      Xend Finance, which can be accessed via a mobile phone, will enable groups to directly store their funds in stablecoins like USDC without a middleman while earning interest on the funds.      “Unlike fiat dollars, dollar-backed stablecoins are available instantly to anyone with an internet-connected device, anywhere in the world, with near-zero transaction fees,” Hawkins said.      Xend Finance, backed by Binance, ran a successful pilot in January with 1,500 participants from 75 countries, according to Ugochukwu. The platform is set to officially launch at the end of March.",POSITIVE,USDC,FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | BNB | USDC,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/15/nigerians-turn-to-stablecoins-for-protection-against-inflation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b329b717998af17f8ad2641769ea8290fd122901-1500x952.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ant Group has 2,298 blockchain patents, having added 586 in 2020, a 33% decline from the 880 filed the year before.  A mammoth 1,215 filed in 2020 by Ping An Group saw the Shenzhen-based conglomerate pip Tencent into second place.  The DWPI scores patents based on various metrics such as technical breadth, geographical coverage and average annual citations to build an ""average strength index"" of companies' patents.  These score metrics push IBM, the only non-Chinese company in the top 10, into second place behind Ant Group. IBM came fourth in terms of number of blockchain patents with 647 filings.

Symbol is a proof-of-stake blockchain with its own token (XYM) the NEM Group is marketing as an enterprise blockchain solution for fintech, supply chains and everything in between. On Symbol's public blockchain, PoS validators can stake a supernode with their XYM or stake their tokens in another supernode's pool.

The platform will allow business to launch their own private blockchains, which can interoperate with Symbol’s public chain. Additionally, the NEM team told CoinDesk, Symbol will support “atomic swaps” to transfer data and coins between different blockchains.      Atomic swaps are an old cryptographic trick that originated from Bitcoin which allow two blockchains to transfer data (typically, a coin) without the need for an intermediary to escrow the trade.    Tokens and DeFi applications    NEM’s Symbol can accommodate the hot DeFi applications of Ethereum fame and the rest like securities tokens and NFTs, Minehan said, using tokens called mosaics. She said that one Kentucky whiskey company has used these mosaics to tokenize barrels of whiskey that only approved buyers can purchase.      For something like NFTs, Minehan said that the next step is ""having a digitization of the underlying asset [like a jpeg] embedded in the transaction itself,"" which requires storing a significant amount of data on-chain.

42386197,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBRhUj,1615808947,This Isn't the Revolution I Signed Up For,"In social networks, online chat rooms and blogs, there is an ugly alignment taking shape between disparate, radical groups that hold all sorts of distorted and misinformed views on the issues of the day.      What is emerging as a common thread across all these groups is a belief that they are under siege and blockchain might be able to fix this. Except the problems they describe are not real problems, and the solutions they propose are even worse.    Paul Brody is EY's Global Blockchain leader.    Do you believe unaccountable liberal elites are destroying America's economy with quantitative easing? Bitcoin’s deflationary algorithm is the solution.      Do you believe conservative voices are being silenced by Silicon Valley liberals? Blockchain-based, censorship-resistant decentralized social networks are the answer.      “Nanny state” regulators blocking your meme-driven stock trading? Be your own bank and dive into decentralized finance.      If any of these were real-world problems, blockchain technology could indeed fix them. They aren’t. Even worse, the proposed “fixes” would do little to strengthen democracy and help the economy. The problem statements behind these proposed fixes are tired, recycled and discredited.      See also: Paul Brody - The Future of Everything Is Free      For old time’s sake, let’s revisit them again:      There is no hyperinflation coming. It did not happen in the last great recession, and it is unlikely again this time. Most economists think our economies need a bit more inflation, not less, and the idea of putting the world on a consistently deflationary standard like Bitcoin terrifies many economists. People can argue about whether we may see a bit more inflation or a bit less in coming years, but no one expects a bout of hyperinflation.      Nor are conservative voices being silenced. While highly placed individuals and platforms who have called for political violence, have been disconnected from privately-owned business services, nobody in the United States is in prison for expressing their opinion.      There is also the idea that regulators are preventing individuals from profiting from their expertise and using qualified investor rules and liquidity rules to protect finance executives from the man-on-the-street. That, too, is untrue.      Qualified investor rules exist to protect people who cannot afford to lose money on risky investments. The evidence strongly shows these rules work as intended and that day traders are, on average, very unsuccessful.    If any of these were real-world problems, blockchain technology could indeed fix them.    Indeed, we already tried this in the world of blockchain with terrible results. Does anyone remember the initial coin offering (ICO) boom? That was 2017 and not so long ago.      Back then, enthusiasts argued ICOs were a better path and might even render VCs obsolete. They were wrong. Nearly three-fourths of all ICO-funded companies never delivered any product at all. Overall, the record of ICO funding was substantially worse than venture capital, and that’s a low bar in an industry that already assumes most startups will fail.      While there is no single group or ideology behind these messages, there seems to be a significant overlap among bitcoin, blockchain boosters and right-wing extremists. It is visible in the popularity of white nationalist imagery in blockchain and bitcoin forums, and in the enthusiastic embrace of decentralization technology by white nationalists in social media.      These are not problems I want to help fix. This is not the revolution I signed up for.    Good blockchain    The decentralization offered by blockchain promises a lot of good. The technology offers us the promise of business models that are built on providing services, not monetizing surveillance. From food traceability to carbon offsets, blockchains allow us to build sophisticated digital markets and channel capital to good uses at remarkably low costs.      Blockchains offer us a future where regulatory compliance can be implemented robustly and cheaply, and where we can offer proof of compliance without having to submit data that undermines our privacy. It will allow enterprises to work with each other without becoming cogs in a digital market structure run by a monopolist.      No technology is unambiguously good or bad. Blockchains do not have moral value and it is not possible to stop the work being done to mature and improve this technology. Nor is it possible to create systems that can only be used for good. Censorship-resistant systems will work equally well whether they spread truth or lies.      See also: Crypto Is the Libertarian Cheat Code in the Final Battle Over State Coercion      Furthermore, many of the critiques of our existing economic and policy infrastructure are fair and true. It is reasonable to feel that far too much of the money was spent in fiscal stimulus (in 2008 and again recently), and that too much of the quantitative easing went to the very rich and not the deserving.      There is good academic evidence our know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations are costly and ineffective and prevent people from joining the mainstream financial system. And, there are many parts of the world where there is a compelling need for communications that cannot be censored.      But reasonable critiques are being over-indulged, giving extreme solutions an entry point.    Breaking the cycle    So how are we to avoid a bleak future where this amazing blockchain technology ends up making the internet safe for white nationalists, liars, fraudsters and science deniers, and, in so doing, turns everyone else against it?      I honestly am not sure, but I have some ideas.      First, can we skip the moral panic and the all-or-nothing approach? Banning blockchain will not work unless we are also planning on shutting down the internet as well. The level of surveillance and intrusion required to implement such a ban would be impractical.      Second, we can advance the constructive uses of blockchain and adapt regulatory models to support the growth of this market. Blockchains can be used to help people tell the difference between real news and misinformation by allowing people to validate the source of their information. In finance, smart contracts can be used to make regulatory compliance cheap, fast and simple as well.    There is no hyperinflation coming.    The historical case of music piracy is an excellent example. BitTorrent, the decentralized peer-to-peer system that was responsible for a great deal of illegal content distribution, is still around. However, it no longer poses an imminent danger to the content business because users can now subscribe to reasonably priced streaming services.      Digital Rights Management (DRM) and anti-piracy software still exists, but it is now well enough executed that very few consumers even notice. Given a fair, safe and legal option, most consumers will pay if they can afford to do so.      Finally, society can vocally and publicly distance itself from extremists and their arguments. You can reasonably make the case that Bitcoin is an excellent hedge against inflation, but we do not need to spread extreme and unfounded fears of hyperinflation to make that point. Furthermore, we cannot be politely silent when such nonsense is being repeated, lest our silence be interpreted as agreement.      The technology industry keeps repeating the same pattern. Our enthusiasm to make the world a better place leaves us unable, or unwilling, to think critically about how great new technologies might be misused, or what steps we could take to give the best outcomes the greatest chance of success. With blockchain technology, we get another chance to repeat this pattern, or to break it.

The crypto market leader fell as low as $54,790.33 Monday morning, having reached a record high of $61,556.59 on Saturday, according to CoinDesk 20 data. At press time, a small bounce to $55,786 was seen.      ""The failure to establish a foothold above $60,000 and the decline is likely the result of the flat-to-negative Coinbase premium – a major bellwether for institutional demand,"" according to Ki Young Ju, CEO of blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant.      CryptoQuant's Coinbase premium indicator measures the spread between Coinbase’s BTC/USD pair and Binance’s BTC/USDT pair. A positive spread implies increased demand from high-net-worth investors and institutions, as these entities prefer to trade via regulated exchanges with over-the-counter desks such as Coinbase.      The premium was negative over the weekend when bitcoin broke above $60,000 and remains marginally positive at press time, implying weak institutional demand.      The spread has been significantly higher previously as prices surged above the major psychological levels of $20,000, $30,000, $40,000, and $50,000. Bitcoin has charted a six-fold rally over the past six months mainly on the back of increased institutional participation      ""I think [we'll see bitcoin] short-term bearish or going sideways until there's significant institutional spot inflows in Coinbase,"" Ju said.      ""Whale addresses holding 1,000 or more bitcoin have been selling, this does not mean the bull run is over, it just means that profit taking is happening,"" according to market analyst Lark Davis.      Meanwhile, Patrick Heusser, head of trading at the Swiss-based Crypto Finance AG, says the latest pullback is healthy, as the breakout above $60,000 was mainly driven by leveraged traders.

The bull run is still in its early stages, he said, adding ""things are going to get a lot more heated from here.""      The top cryptocurrency by market value is trading near $57,940 at press time, having hit a record high of $61,556.59 on Saturday, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Prices have rallied by 500% since early October.      According to Byworth, the Federal Reserve's massive money printing program and the devaluation of the dollar is having a ""push effect onto bitcoin."" The top cryptocurrency by market value is further facing a supply crisis due to the miners reward halving in May 2020 (which halved the issuance of new units) and increased institutional participation, he said.      ""We are starting to see institutional adoption to a degree that is so extreme, that you've got four companies – MicroStrategy, Tesla, Square and now recently Meitu – owning 40% of bitcoin's annual supply in just a few months,"" Byworth said.      Also read: The Case for $1M Bitcoin      Speaking about potential risks to the bullish price outlook, Byworth said an early unwinding of stimulus by the U.S. Federal Reserve ""would put a bit of a [damper] on things.""      Markets recently started pricing in a shift in the timing of the first Fed interest rate hike to the end 2022 from 2024. However, according to Byworth, the U.S. central bank has little room to unwind stimulus, as the longer-term technological backdrop is deflationary.      When quizzed about regulators' concerns about the blockchain technology's anonymity factor, Byworth said that ""bitcoin isn't anonymous, and can be tracked very very easily.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/15/diginex-anticipating-bitcoin-rise-to-175k-by-end-of-2021-ceo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/515ddf13f8c4d675098fbe7509d09947bec454fe-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As reported by Reuters on Monday, trading, mining, issuance and possession of cryptocurrencies are expected to be criminalized in India under an upcoming legislative bill.      The official, who was not named, said the legislation is likely to make it through Prime Minister Narendra Modi's majority-controlled parliament.      The official said fines would be issued for breaking the law after a six-month grace period to dispose of crypto assets, according to the report.      The situation is turning out to be terribly confusing for stakeholders in India. On the same day as the Reuters report, the Deccan Herald, an English-language newspaper in India, cited Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs Nirmala Sitharaman as saying the government is not planning to completely bar cryptocurrency use.      ""From our side, we are very clear that we are not shutting all options. We will allow certain windows for people to do experiments on the blockchain, bitcoins or cryptocurrency,"" Sitharaman said. She added the growth of the fintech industry depends on such experiments.      The government has been saying for months it plans to rein in private use of cryptocurrency while providing the legal framework for India's Reserve Bank (RBI) to issue its own central bank digital coin.      Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur said on March 6 that the government was looking into national security risks posed by cryptocurrencies ahead of a decision on whether to ban them.      In March of last year, the country's Supreme Court overturned the RBI's 2018 decision to ban financial institutions under its remit from providing services to cryptocurrency companies.
