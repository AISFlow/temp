According to crypto analyst Mags, the cryptocurrency‚Äôs past history around its halvings gives a timeline on when to expect the next Bitcoin price milestone. Mags made this known in a social media post on X, detailing how Bitcoin surged between 234 and 216 days after the past two halvings to reach new all-time highs. Crypto Analyst‚Äôs Prediction Model Based On Past Halvings Crypto analysts have developed different models in the past year to predict when Bitcoin may reach new all-time highs based on historical trends. However, crypto analyst Mags has gone in the way of Bitcoin halvings, with the next halving fast approaching. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Prediction: Crypto Analysts Reveal Catalyst That Will Drive Price Above $3,500 Mag‚Äôs tweet pointed out that, historically, it took Bitcoin 234 days after its 2016 halving to break over its all-time high. Then, Bitcoin‚Äôs highest price was capped at $1,242 on November 29, 2013. The crypto would then maintain this spectacular bull run to reach $19,783, which would be its all-time high for the next three years. In a similar manner, BitcoinBTCwould then break over the all-time high at this point 216 days after its 2020 halving. The crypto would maintain the bullish momentum throughout the year and into 2021 to reach its current all-time high of $68,789. Bitcoin halvings happen around every four years to reduce the amount of BTC rewards miners get for every block mined on the Bitcoin blockchain. The next schedule is slated to occur 130 days from now and sometime around April 2024, reducing the mining reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. According to Mags, if history repeats itself, we could see another Bitcoin all-time high in 130 days plus 234 days, putting the next timeline in December 2024, 364 days from now.

20971527,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559593,1701542749,Do Kwon: What Happened To The Terra Luna Founder?,"Few names have sparked as much intrigue and controversy as Do Kwon (sometimes called Kwon Do). From the meteoric rise of Terra Luna to its sudden and tumultuous downfall, Do Kwon has become a figure of significant interest and speculation. In this comprehensive exploration, we delve into the journey of Terra Luna‚Äôs Do Kwon, the mastermind behind one of the most talked-about projects in the crypto world. We‚Äôll uncover the latest Do Kwon news that has kept the crypto community on its toes, analyze the Do Kwon net worth, and shed light into the future of Terra Luna without its founder. Who is Do Kwon? Do Kwon, whose full name is Kwon Do-hyung, is a South Korean crypto entrepreneur renowned as the co-founder and CEO of Terraform Labs. Born on September 6, 1991, in Seoul, South Korea, he has become a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency industry. Kwon Do-hyung‚Äôs early education took place at Daewon Foreign Language High School in Seoul, one of South Korea‚Äôs most prestigious private schools. Furthermore, his academic journey led him to Stanford University in the United States, where he pursued a degree in computer science, laying the groundwork for his future endeavors in the tech and crypto industries. Tracing The Origins: The Path To Crypto Fame After graduating from Stanford in 2015, Kwon Do-hyung returned to South Korea in 2016 and founded Anyfi, a connectivity solutions startup. Anyfi, which focused on a peer-to-peer Wi-Fi mesh network, was Do.Kwon‚Äôs initial foray into the tech startup world. However, his interest soon pivoted to the then-nascent crypto market. After identifying a lack of robust crypto payment networks, he co-authored a white paper with Nicholas Platias, advocating for a decentralized payment system powered by a stablecoin to facilitate cryptocurrency payments and provide a medium of exchange with reduced volatility. The Beginnings Of Terra Luna This white paper caught the attention of Daniel Shin (whose full name is Shin Hyun-seung), a seasoned South Korean tech entrepreneur experienced in online payment systems. Afterwards, in 2018, Kwon Do-hyung and Hyun-seung co-founded Terraform Labs, leading to the development of the Terra (LUNA) cryptocurrency. Terraform Labs introduced TerraUSD (UST), an algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, in September 2020. The stability mechanism of UST, backed by the LUNA token, was a novel approach in the crypto world but ultimately led to the collapse of both cryptocurrencies in May 2022. But more on that later. The Rise And Fall Of Terra Luna And Do Kwon The story of Terra Luna and its co-founder Kwon Do-hyung is a tale of rapid ascension and dramatic downfall in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. It‚Äôs a narrative that encapsulates the inherent risks and potential of innovative financial technologies, and the fine line between genius and overreach. Do Kwon Crypto Achievements Do Kwon, as the co-founder of Terraform Labs, significantly impacted the cryptocurrency sector with the introduction of Terra Luna. Terraform Labs, under Kwon Do-hyung‚Äôs leadership, innovated in the realm of stablecoins, aiming to solve the problem of volatility in the crypto market. Terra Luna‚Äôs unique selling point was its dual-token system: the native LUNA token and the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin. UST was designed as an algorithmic stablecoin, an ambitious attempt to maintain a stable value relative to the US dollar without the need for traditional fiat collateral. Do Kwon Luna: Triumphs And Trials Terra Luna‚Äôs ecosystem experienced rapid growth and success, particularly with the popularity of its Anchor Protocol, which promised high yields on UST deposits. This contributed to a significant increase in LUNA‚Äôs value, as the protocol‚Äôs design required LUNA to be burned to mint UST, thereby reducing LUNA‚Äôs supply and increasing its price. However, the success of Terra Luna and its algorithmic stablecoin also brought increased scrutiny and challenges, especially concerning the sustainability and resilience of its stabilization mechanism. Do Kwon Terra‚Äôs Downfall The downfall of Terra Luna began with the destabilization of UST. Unlike traditional stablecoins backed by fiat or physical assets, UST‚Äôs stability was algorithmically linked to LUNA. To bolster confidence and add an additional layer of stability to UST, Terraform Labs amassed a significant reserve of Bitcoin. The idea was that these Bitcoin reserves could be liquidated to defend the UST peg in times of stress. At its peak, the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), established to manage these reserves, held over $3 billion in Bitcoin. However, when UST began to lose its peg due to massive sell-offs in May 2022, this triggered a series of events that led to the liquidation of these Bitcoin reserves. The sale of such a large amount of Bitcoin in a short period contributed to a crash in the crypto market. This strategy of using Bitcoin as a reserve asset for an algorithmic stablecoin was unprecedented and, in this instance, ultimately proved ineffective. The rapid devaluation of UST and LUNA, coupled with the liquidation of Bitcoin reserves, not only led to the collapse of Terra Luna‚Äôs ecosystem but also sent shockwaves through the entire cryptocurrency market, eroding billions in market capitalization and investor confidence. The Terra Luna crisis highlighted the risks of algorithmic stablecoins and the complexities of using volatile assets like Bitcoin as a backing mechanism in times of market stress. Do Kwon Net Worth The financial trajectory of Kwon Do-hyung, marked by both remarkable successes and significant setbacks, paints a complex picture of his net worth. The Wealth Rollercoaster: Do Kwon Net Worth The Do Kwon net worth has been a subject of intense interest, especially in the wake of the Terra Luna collapse. At the peak of Terra Luna‚Äôs success, Do Kwon‚Äôs net worth was speculated to be in the billions, given the high valuation of the LUNA token and the Terra ecosystem. In April 2022, LUNA‚Äôs value soared, and the Terra ecosystem reached a staggering $60 billion valuation, significantly boosting the Do Kwon net worth. However, this fortune was short-lived. Following the dramatic collapse of Terra Luna in May 2022, the Do Kwon net worth plummeted alongside the value of LUNA and UST. By July 2023, estimates placed his net worth at around $135 million, a substantial decrease from his peak wealth. Accordingly, this decline was primarily due to the obliteration of the Terra ecosystem, which significantly eroded the value of his holdings in LUNA and related crypto assets. However, it‚Äôs important to note that the exact extent of Kwon‚Äôs current wealth, especially in liquid assets, remains somewhat opaque. His involvement in other blockchain projects and potential holdings in various cryptocurrencies may contribute to his overall financial portfolio. Do Kwon News: The Latest Developments Do Kwon‚Äôs situation has evolved rapidly, with significant developments unfolding after the Terra Luna collapse. As of the latest updates, Kwon Do-hyung faced legal challenges from multiple jurisdictions, including the United States and South Korea. In September 2022, a South Korean court issued an arrest warrant for Do Kwon, along with other individuals associated with Terra, on charges related to the collapse of the cryptocurrency. Following the issuance of an Interpol Red Notice, Kwon Do-hyung was reported to have moved from Singapore and was believed to be in Serbia, before fleeing to Balkan state Montenegro. South Korean and US authorities continued their pursuit, seeking his extradition to face various charges, including securities fraud. Do Kwon News In 2023 In February 2023, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Kwon and Terraform Labs with securities fraud, alleging the creation of a fraudulent scheme that led to substantial investor losses. Afterwards, Do Kwon‚Äôs legal representatives contested these charges, challenging the SEC‚Äôs claims and its characterization of LUNA and other tokens as securities. Authorities arrested Kwon in Montenegro on March 23, 2023, as he prepared to board a private jet to Dubai with falsified documents. Subsequently, a Montenegrin court sentenced him to four months in jail for document forgery, involving multiple passports and identity cards. This Do Kwon news followed an international search initiated by South Korean authorities, with both South Korea and the US seeking extradition related to Terra Luna‚Äôs collapse. In June 2023, the High Court in Podgorica confirmed that the Terra Luna founder would be held in ‚Äúextradition custody‚Äù for a six-month period pending the review of South Korea‚Äôs extradition request. The Future Outlook For Do Kwon And Terra Luna Uncertainty and complexity shroud the future outlook for Do Kwon and the Terra Luna project. For Kwon, the immediate focus is on the legal challenges he faces. Furthermore, his extradition and the outcomes of the trials will significantly influence his personal and professional future. As for Terra Luna, its future hinges on restoring investor confidence and demonstrating the viability of its revamped ecosystem, Terra 2.0. Furthermore, the effectiveness of Terra 2.0 and its ability to attract new users and developers will be critical in determining the project‚Äôs long-term viability. However, as of November 7, the Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) price was on the verge of a breakout from a multi-month downtrend channel. FAQ What Is The Current Do Kwon Net Worth? As of July 2023, estimates place the Do Kwon net worth at around $135 million, marking a significant decrease from its peak during the height of Terra Luna‚Äôs success. Who Is Do Kwon? Do Kwon (whose full name is Kwon Do-hyung) is a South Korean entrepreneur, the co-founder, and CEO of Terraform Labs, known for creating the Terra Luna cryptocurrency ecosystem. How Has Do Kwon News Affected Terra Luna‚Äôs Stability? The Do Kwon news, especially regarding legal challenges and his arrest, has negatively impacted Terra Luna‚Äôs stability, eroding investor confidence and raising concerns about the project‚Äôs future. What Was Do Kwon Luna‚Äôs Strategy For Crypto? Kwon‚Äôs strategy involved creating a stablecoin ecosystem with an algorithmic approach, aiming to reduce crypto market volatility and promote wider adoption of digital currencies. What Are the Implications Of Do Kwon Stanford Education On His Career? Kwon‚Äôs Stanford education provided a strong foundation in computer science and a network of peers and mentors, instrumental in his foray into the tech and crypto industries. What‚Äôs The Latest Do Kwon News And Terra Luna? The latest Do Kwon news include his arrest in Montenegro in March 2023 for document forgery and ongoing legal proceedings involving his extradition to face charges related to the Terra Luna collapse. What Was Do Kwon‚Äôs Vision For Terra Luna? Kwon envisioned Terra Luna as a blockchain platform that would revolutionize digital finance by offering a stable and scalable cryptocurrency, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional cryptocurrencies.

This time around, he has identified exactly what needs to happen for the crypto token to enjoy a significant rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin A Tad Closer To $40,000 ‚Äì Is $41K The Next Stop In A Few Days? All Eyes On The MACD In a post shared on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, JD highlighted the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) as the trigger for the crypto to enjoy a significant rally. He noted how XRP went ‚Äúparabolic‚Äù the last time the MACD crossed the 0 level. According to him, that hasn‚Äôt happened this time, but the market seems very close to that level. JD shared an accompanying chart to elucidate his point. From the chart, one could see that XRP enjoyed a 650x gain the last time the MACD crossed 0. This significant breakout, which came in 2017, happened after a 4-year trendline that dated back to 2014. This time, the coin has consolidated for a longer period as he highlighted an 8-year trendline that dates back to 2017. He expects the market to instantly become bullish if there can be a breakout from that trendline. For now, JD believes that a bullish cross is still in play despite the fact that the MACD is below 0. In response to his post, another X user stated that ‚Äúit‚Äôs game over‚Äù once XRP crosses the $0.92 price level. JD seemed to agree as he stated that it was going to happen. Meanwhile, the crypto analyst has remained cautious about giving a prediction as to what price level XRP could hit. However, from the chart he shared, XRP could rise to as high as $15, taking a cue from 2017. We break that 0.92 level and it‚Äôs game over. ‚Äî Nick | Crypto Crusader (@NCashOfficial) December 2, 2023 XRP currently trading at $0.61393 territory on the daily chart: TradingView.com Between XRP And Bitcoin Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has also given his view on the future trajectory of XRP in relation to Bitcoin. He spoke about a ‚ÄúHelheim Gate Way‚Äù scenario and how Bitcoin‚Äôs price could affect XRP‚Äôs. He said BTC surging to the 48k-50k range might exert pressure on XRP, causing it to decline against the flagship cryptocurrency.

Instead, these miners seem to be experiencing a downturn in their revenue even as the Bitcoin Halving looms. Related Reading: Bitcoin A Tad Closer To $40,000 ‚Äì Is $41K The Next Stop In A Few Days? Bitcoin Miners‚Äô Revenue Down By Over 30% According to a report by BanklessTimes, the revenue of these miners is down by over 30% in the past six months. Interestingly, these miners had their most profitable month when Bitcoin‚Äôs price was just picking up at the beginning of the year. Their revenue soared to as high as $918.8 million in January. In the months after that, there was a significant decrease in the revenue earned. Things began to pick up again in October, as that month represented their second-highest monthly earnings of 2023. They are reported to have earned $885 million in that period. However, the downward trend resurfaced in November as these miners saw a drop in their revenue once again. The total earned in that month stood at $615.1 million. Commenting on this data, BanklessTimes crypto expert Alice Leetham noted how this has become a cause for concern. This brought about the need to analyze factors that may be contributing to this downward trend. BTC market cap currently at $758 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: Ethereum ATH: Exploring The Possibility Of Ether‚Äôs New Peaks In 2024 Factors Contributing To The Trend The volatile nature of Bitcoin prices has been singled out as the most obvious factor affecting miners‚Äô revenue. Bitcoin‚Äôs failure to meet certain price projections has directly impacted the profitability of mining projections. There is the likelihood that certain miners doubled down on their operations in hopes that the crypto token will hit certain milestones, and that hasn‚Äôt happened. Bitcoin mining difficulty adjustment is said to be another factor for this downward trend. Mining difficulty becomes higher as more miners enter the network. This ultimately leads to a decrease in miners‚Äô revenue as more persons are competing to mine a block. Bitcoin‚Äôs popularity hasn‚Äôt helped in this regard, as the network continues to attract an increasing number of miners. Meanwhile, there is also the Bitcoin Halving event, which will be playing in the minds of these miners. This is when miners‚Äô rewards are cut in half. The next one is scheduled for April 2024. With this downward trend and the halving on the way, it isn‚Äôt surprising that these miners are looking to diversify their operations. BanklessTimes, however, believes that things could start looking up once again for these miners. They highlighted the ongoing advancements and increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as factors that might help ‚Äúcounterbalance these difficulties.‚Äù Featured image from Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-miner-revenue-sees-massive-6-month-crash-whats-going-on/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

20965194,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560109,1701528007,What Are Altcoins? Guide: How To Spot Altcoin Season And How To Buy,"Altcoins, or alternative cryptocurrencies, have become a buzzword in the digital currency landscape, offering a world beyond Bitcoin (BTC). This guide explores the essence of altcoins, answering the pivotal question: What are altcoins? From the historical rise of altcoins to the exciting phenomenon of altcoin season, we delve into the intricacies that define this dynamic market. What Are Altcoins? Understanding The Basics Altcoins, short for ‚Äúalternative coins,‚Äù encompass a diverse range of cryptocurrencies that have emerged following the success of Bitcoin. They are not simply imitations of Bitcoin but represent a broad spectrum of digital currencies with unique attributes, purposes, and technological innovations. Characteristics Of Altcoins Each altcoin is distinguished by its unique blockchain technology and consensus mechanism. For instance, Ethereum, one of the most prominent altcoins, utilizes a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which is less energy-intensive compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs Proof-of-Work (PoW) system. XRP operates on a consensus protocol known as the Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm, designed for high-speed and energy-efficient transactions. Cardano employs the Ouroboros PoS algorithm, acclaimed for its security and scalability. These varying consensus mechanisms reflect the diverse goals and technological advancements of altcoins, ranging from enhancing transaction efficiency to ensuring greater security and sustainability. Altcoins also vary significantly in their market capitalization, liquidity, community support, and real-world applications. For example, Litecoin, often referred to as the silver to Bitcoin‚Äôs gold, offers faster transaction confirmation times, making it suitable for smaller, everyday transactions. Meanwhile, Binance Coin (BNB) is intricately linked to the Binance exchange ecosystem, providing utility within that specific platform. Differences Between Altcoins And Bitcoin One of the stark contrasts between Bitcoin and many altcoins is their development and governance structure. Bitcoin, created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, who has since left the project in December 2010, operates in a decentralized and open-source manner without a central authority. In contrast, many altcoins have identifiable founding teams or organizations overseeing their development. For example, Ethereum is backed by the Ethereum Foundation, Solana is developed by Solana Labs, and Cardano is spearheaded by IOG (Input Output Global). Another key difference lies in their transaction speeds and capabilities. Bitcoin, primarily designed as a digital store of value and medium of exchange, processes transactions approximately every 10 minutes. In contrast, altcoins like Ripple‚Äôs XRP have a much-shorter block time and can process transactions in seconds, making it a preferred choice for cross-border money transfers. Ethereum, with its smart contract functionality, enables a wide range of decentralized applications (dapps) beyond simple monetary transactions. Furthermore, while Bitcoin‚Äôs maximum supply is capped at 21 million coins, altcoins have varied approaches to supply. For example, Ethereum initially had no cap. With the introduction of EIP-1559, Ethereum developers have introduced a mechanism that burns a portion of the supply with each transaction, potentially making its supply deflationary over time. XRP ‚Äì like many other altcoins ‚Äì was premined and has a capped total supply of 100 billion XRP. The Rise Of Altcoins: A History The history of altcoins is a captivating narrative of innovation, market dynamics, and the continuous pursuit of refining digital currency technology. Since the inception of Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency, there has been a surge in the creation of alternative cryptocurrencies, each seeking to address perceived limitations of Bitcoin or to introduce new features and use cases. The First Altcoins Gaining Traction The journey of altcoins began soon after the establishment of Bitcoin, with the creation of Namecoin in April 2011. Namecoin aimed to decentralize domain-name registration, making internet censorship more difficult. Following Namecoin, Litecoin was launched in October 2011, envisioned as the ‚Äúsilver‚Äù to Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äúgold.‚Äù Litecoin offered faster transaction confirmation times and a different hashing algorithm (Scrypt). Following these, another notable early altcoin included Peercoin, introduced in 2012, which was the first to implement a Proof-of-Stake/Proof-of-Work hybrid system. Another significant early player was XRP which was created in 2012. The XRP Ledger was launched in June 2012 by the founders of Ripple Labs, including Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb. Shortly after that, Dogecoin was launched in December 2013, initially created as a light-hearted take on cryptocurrency. Remarkably, not all early altcoins sustained their momentum. Many, like Feathercoin and Terracoin, which gained attention initially, saw their influence wane over the years. These coins, while innovative in their time, couldn‚Äôt keep up with the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market or build a lasting community and development ecosystem. Evolution Of The Altcoin Market The altcoin market has evolved significantly over the years, expanding beyond simple variations of Bitcoin‚Äôs technology. The introduction of Ethereum in 2015 was a watershed moment. Ethereum‚Äôs innovation was not just in creating a new cryptocurrency but in introducing a platform for decentralized applications (dApps) through smart contracts. This breakthrough opened the doors for a new era of blockchain technology, where altcoins could serve various purposes beyond mere currency, from powering decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The market saw an influx of diverse altcoins based on Ethereum, each catering to specific niches and use cases. Key Milestones In Altcoin History Several key milestones mark the history of altcoins. The Initial Coin Offering (ICO) boom in 2017 was one such significant event. ICOs became a popular method for new cryptocurrency projects to raise funds, leading to the launch of thousands of new altcoins. However, this period also saw increased regulatory scrutiny and instances of fraud, leading to a more cautious market approach. Another major development was the rise of DeFi in 2020, where altcoins played a central role in enabling decentralized lending, borrowing, and trading, independent of traditional financial institutions. This era also witnessed the surge in popularity of NFTs, with altcoins like Ethereum being at the forefront of this new digital asset class. These milestones highlight the dynamic nature of the altcoin market, continuously shaped by technological advancements and shifting market sentiments. Top Altcoins To Watch As the crypto market continues to evolve, a number of altcoins have risen to prominence, each offering unique advantages and innovations. This section highlights some of the top altcoins that have captured the market‚Äôs attention due to their technological advancements, community support, and potential for future growth. Overview of Top Altcoins Ethereum (ETH): Often regarded as the leading altcoin, Ethereum is renowned for its smart contract functionality, which has paved the way for decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. Solana (SOL): Solana has gained popularity for its incredibly fast and low-cost transactions, leveraging a unique combination of proof-of-history (PoH) and proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms. XRP: Despite legal challenges in the United States, Ripple has established itself and the XRP token as a significant player, primarily for its use in fast and efficient cross-border money transfers. Binance Coin (BNB): Originally created as a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, BNB has expanded its use cases to include transaction fee discounts, token sales, and more within the Binance ecosystem. Cardano (ADA): Known for its strong focus on sustainability and scientific philosophy, Cardano offers a third-generation blockchain that promises more scalability and security through its unique Ouroboros proof-of-stake algorithm. Polkadot (DOT): Polkadot stands out for its interoperability, enabling different blockchains to transfer messages and value in a trust-free fashion; it‚Äôs also scalable and customizable. These are just a few examples of the numerous altcoins in the market, each contributing to the diverse landscape of cryptocurrency in their unique ways. Features That Make Altcoins Stand Out Altcoins distinguish themselves through various features that cater to specific needs and use cases: Smart Contract Capabilities: Ethereum‚Äôs introduction of smart contracts revolutionized the blockchain space, enabling the creation of complex, programmable transactions and applications. Scalability And Speed: Altcoins like Solana and Cardano have focused on solving scalability issues, offering faster transaction speeds and lower fees compared to older blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Interoperability: Projects like Polkadot and Cosmos address the issue of blockchain interoperability, allowing different networks to communicate and exchange information seamlessly. Niche Applications: Some altcoins target specific sectors or use cases, such as Chainlink‚Äôs focus on providing real-world data to blockchain networks through oracles, or Monero‚Äôs emphasis on privacy and anonymity. What Is Altcoin Season? Altcoin season or ‚Äúaltseason‚Äù is a term that describes a period in the crypto market when altcoins significantly outperform Bitcoin. It‚Äôs a phase where investors‚Äô appetite for riskier assets grows, and capital flows from Bitcoin into altcoins, often resulting in substantial price surges for these alternative coins. Understanding when an altcoin season is on the horizon can be crucial for cryptocurrency traders and investors looking to capitalize on market trends. Indicators Of An Upcoming Altcoin Season A key indicator of an impending altcoin season can be the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) chart, which tracks the percentage of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization contributed by Bitcoin. Technical analysts scrutinize this chart for signs of decreasing dominance, which may suggest that altcoins are starting to take up a larger share of the market. Support and resistance levels on this chart can indicate potential shifts in market dynamics. For instance, a sustained fall below a major support level could signal the beginning of altcoin season. Remarkably, the market often moves in cycles which can be broken down into four distinct phases, as illustrated in the image provided by crypto analyst Ted (@tedtalksmacro): Phase 1: Bitcoin ‚Äì The cycle often starts with Bitcoin‚Äôs price surging as money flows into Bitcoin, causing significant price increases. Phase 2: Ethereum ‚Äì Money begins to flow into Ethereum, which might struggle to keep up initially but then starts to outperform Bitcoin, leading to discussions about ‚Äòthe flippening‚Äô (where Ethereum‚Äôs market cap could surpass Bitcoin‚Äôs). Phase 3: Large Caps ‚Äì As Ethereum starts outperforming Bitcoin, investors begin to venture into large-cap altcoins, which then start to see large buy-ups and price increases. Phase 4: ‚ÄúAltseason‚Äù ‚Äì In this final phase, enthusiasm spreads across the market; large caps have gone full vertical, and attention turns to mid and small-cap altcoins. All categories, regardless of fundamentals, tend to pump around the same time, leading to a parabolic increase in altcoin prices. This phase is marked by high levels of excitement and media attention. How to Buy Altcoins: A Step-by-Step Guide Purchasing altcoins can seem daunting for newcomers to the cryptocurrency space, but by following a clear step-by-step process, it can be straightforward and secure. Here‚Äôs a simplified guide to help you through the process: Research: Before anything else, conduct thorough research to determine which altcoins align with your investment goals and risk tolerance. Choose A Wallet: Select a digital wallet that supports the altcoin you wish to purchase. Wallets can be software-based (like mobile or desktop applications) or hardware-based for added security. Select A Cryptocurrency Exchange: Choose an altcoin exchange that lists the altcoin you‚Äôre interested in and is known for its reliability, security, and ease of use. Register And Secure Your Account: Create an account on the chosen exchange and set up strong authentication measures, including two-factor authentication (2FA). Fund Your Account: Deposit funds into your exchange account. This can often be done via bank transfer, credit card, or by depositing other cryptocurrencies. Place An Order: Navigate to the market or trading pair for your chosen altcoin and place a buy order. You can opt for a market order for an immediate purchase at current prices or a limit order to specify a price at which you‚Äôre willing to buy. Store Your Altcoins Securely: After the purchase, transfer your altcoins to your personal wallet for safekeeping, especially if you‚Äôre planning on holding them for the long term. Where to Buy Altcoins You can purchase altcoins on a variety of platforms, each offering its own set of features, fees, and security measures. Here are some of the most common places where you can buy altcoins: Centralized Exchanges: These are the most common platforms for buying altcoins and include well-known exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. They offer a wide range of altcoins and are typically user-friendly. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): DEXs like Uniswap and SushiSwap allow for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for an intermediary. They offer a higher degree of privacy and direct wallet-to-wallet trades. Cryptocurrency Brokers: Platforms like eToro and Robinhood act as brokers, offering an easy entry point for buying cryptocurrencies. However, they may have a more limited selection of altcoins compared to dedicated exchanges. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Platforms: Websites like OKX P2P or Remitano connect buyers and sellers directly. While they offer flexibility in payment methods, they require a higher degree of trust between parties. When choosing where to buy altcoins, consider factors such as security, fees, the variety of available altcoins, and the user experience of the platform. Always ensure that the platform you choose complies with the regulatory standards in your jurisdiction. Are Altcoins A Good Investment? The question of whether altcoins are a good investment depends on various factors, including market conditions, the specific altcoin‚Äôs potential for growth, and the investor‚Äôs risk tolerance and investment strategy. Pros Of Investing In Altcoins: High Growth Potential: Some altcoins have shown the capacity for high returns on investment, outperforming traditional assets in their best periods. Diversification: Altcoins can diversify an investment portfolio, potentially reducing risk by spreading exposure across different asset classes. Innovation: Investing in altcoins can be a way to support and be part of innovative blockchain projects that may transform various industries. Cons Of Investing In Altcoins: Volatility: Altcoins can be highly volatile, with the potential for significant price swings that can lead to substantial gains or losses. Market Maturity: Compared to more established markets, the cryptocurrency market is relatively young and can be unpredictable. Regulatory Uncertainty: Altcoins face regulatory challenges that can impact their value and legality. Investors considering altcoins should conduct thorough research, understand the risks involved, and consider speaking with a financial advisor. Investment decisions should be based on an individual‚Äôs financial situation, investment objectives, and risk tolerance. Are Altcoins Dead Or Thriving? The altcoin market is a diverse ecosystem with a wide range of projects boasting various levels of innovation, utility, and community support. Similar to the early days of the internet which led to the Dot-Com bubble, the cryptocurrency space is experiencing its own form of natural selection where not all projects will survive in the long term. The Reality Of Altcoin Longevity: Oversaturation: The market has seen an explosion of altcoins, with thousands currently in existence. Many of these coins serve similar functions or aim to solve the same problems, leading to an oversaturated market where only the strongest or most unique can survive. User And Company Adoption: For an altcoin to thrive, it must gain widespread adoption among users and businesses. However, with so many options available, not every altcoin will achieve the necessary adoption rate to sustain its network. Innovation And Continuous Development: The technology underlying altcoins is rapidly evolving. Projects that fail to innovate or adapt to new advancements are likely to fall behind and eventually become obsolete. Survival Of The Fittest: The ‚ÄòAmazon‚Äô Of Altcoins: There will be altcoins that manage to carve out a niche for themselves and become integral to the crypto economy, much like Amazon did for e-commerce. These projects typically have strong fundamentals, clear use cases, active development teams, and robust community support. The ‚ÄòPets.com‚Äô Of Altcoins: Conversely, some altcoins will fade into obscurity, similar to the fate of Pets.com and other failed Dot-Com ventures. Reasons for this include poor management, lack of clear use cases, failure to deliver on promises, or simply the inability to compete with more successful projects. Market Dynamics And Speculation: Speculative Bubbles: The altcoin market is not immune to hype and speculation, which can lead to bubbles. Projects that rise rapidly on speculation rather than solid fundamentals are at risk of crashing just as quickly. Regulatory Challenges: Authorities are still defining the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. Altcoins that fall foul of future regulations or fail to navigate the complex legal environment may face challenges that could impede their growth or lead to their demise. In conclusion, while the altcoin market as a whole shows signs of thriving, with continuous innovation and increasing integration into the broader financial system, it‚Äôs clear that not every altcoin will survive the test of time. Investors should be discerning, focusing on projects with solid fundamentals, active development, and real-world utility to identify those with the potential to succeed in the long term.

Among the myriad of cryptocurrencies, five stand out as prime candidates for a major price explosion. Cardano (ADA), Celestia (TIA), THORchain (RUNE), Terra Classic (LUNC), and the perennial giant Bitcoin (BTC) have captured the attention of investors and analysts alike. With unique features, strong fundamentals, and a buzz of anticipation surrounding them, these top-tier cryptos are positioned to make significant moves in the coming weeks, potentially reshaping the landscape of the crypto market. Related Reading: Ethereum ATH: Exploring The Possibility Of Ether‚Äôs New Peaks In 2024 Top 5 Cryptos Set To Rally This December Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin is moving rapidly in the direction of the $40,000 mark. The potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF by the Securities and Exchange Commission is one of the many variables driving the price of bitcoin. In the 24 hours leading up to early Friday morning, the price of bitcoin increased 3.2%, reaching approximately $38,856, according to statistics provided by price tracker Coingecko. Coincodex has a more bullish prediction for Bitcoin, seeing the crypto hitting $58K in the coming month. Source: Coincodex Analysts such as CryptosRUs anticipate that Bitcoin will soon reach $40,000 and even more, pointing to the impending halving event and possible approvals for ETFs as major catalysts. Cardano (ADA) As November came to an end, Cardano (ADA) saw a 30% increase in price, marking its second consecutive month-over-month gain. Around the present rates, bullish traders have actively placed orders to buy an additional 41.7 million units of the coin, greatly outnumbering sell orders. According to cryptocurrency expert Crypto, ADA can surpass the $0.90 threshold in less than six months. The primary cause is the explosive growth of decentralized banking apps on Cardano, with a $250 million increase in total locked value over the previous year from $50 million. #Cardano sits at a key demand zone between $0.37 and $0.38. Here, 166,470 wallets acquired 4.88 billion $ADA. With minimal resistance ahead and solid support below, remaining above this zone could pave the way for $ADA to climb to new yearly highs. Still, watch out, as losing‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/GDjhspFSVr ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) November 27, 2023 Analyst Ali Martinez projected in November 2023 that ADA would reach annual highs, which would be advantageous for the coin‚Äôs prospects in 2024. Celestia (TIA) Because Celestia (TIA) is the industry‚Äôs first modular blockchain network and has huge future potential, market experts believe it will be a worthwhile investment in 2023. The price behavior of Celestia (TIA) shows a bullish pattern, with local support at $6.20 and resistance at $7.27. Following the breakdown of the resistance, experts predict a possible rally toward $8. Bulls claim that TIA may rise as high as $9.70 by the end of 2023, despite the fact that the Celestia mainnet went live on October 31. As of today, the market cap of cryptocurrencies stood at $1.4 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com Crypto Year-End Rally THORChain (RUNE) The value of THORChain (RUNE) increased from $3.76 last week to $6.35 by the end of November, a 70% increase driven by the rise of THORChain as the second-largest decentralized exchange. Overall, the coin‚Äôs mood is still positive. Forecasts for the end of 2023 indicate that there may be a peak at $10.2, with crucial support levels between $3.4 and $4 being essential to maintaining this development trajectory. The price of THORChain (RUNE), a decentralized liquidity protocol token, is continuing to rise, exhibiting a bullish bias in its trade.

Production costs can serve as a floor for bitcoin's price and help determine if it is undervalued. The valuation of bitcoin is influenced by factors such as real interest rates, money supply growth, and fiscal policy in the US dollar. ‚ÄúOn behalf of the professional investment community, I am respectfully asking any crypto expert to put together some cogent, coherent concept of how to make buy and sell decisions in a cryptocurrency portfolio.‚Äù ‚Äî Franklin J. Parker, CFA, ‚ÄúCrypto‚Äôs Unanswered Question: At What Price?‚Äù Introduction Before diving into the bitcoin valuation task, we must first acknowledge that this is no ordinary undertaking. Unlike traditional assets such as stocks and bonds, bitcoin (BTC-USD) lacks the typical characteristics required for traditional valuation methods. It doesn‚Äôt generate cash flows, pay dividends, or otherwise offer yields, and thus may be more reminiscent of commodities, which are both cyclical in nature and notoriously difficult to value. Nevertheless, there are a number of sensible frameworks through which to view this evolution in money and finance. So, in response to the question posed by Franklin J. Parker, CFA, here are four bitcoin valuation methods that highlight different ways of exploring the cryptocurrency‚Äôs worth and offer insights into this nascent yet powerful technology. 1. Compare It with the Alternatives One way to gauge bitcoin‚Äôs value is to determine what asset classes or securities it competes with and compare their potential value. So, to extend our commodity metaphor, where does bitcoin ‚Äî so-called digital gold ‚Äî stand relative to actual gold? Both are fixed-supply, counterparty-free assets with rare and desirable monetary characteristics and used by investors as long-term safe havens for capital preservation. Today, gold has a market capitalization of roughly $11.5 trillion. If bitcoin reached a similar market capitalization, then the price per coin would exceed $500,000. Bitcoin Valuation: Alternatives Comparison Sources: Glassnode, World Gold Council, Trading Economics, Savills, Visual Capitalist, and Sound Money Of course, bitcoin has something of a technological edge over gold. It is digital, decentralized, and free from government influence. So, if its market capitalization reaches $11.5 trillion, why would it stop there? And is gold its only competition? Couldn‚Äôt bitcoin stand in for other financial collateral and store-of-value assets like global bonds or even residential property? To be sure, definitive answers to these questions are elusive, but trying to find them can enhance our understanding of bitcoin, bitcoin valuation, and the crypto phenomenon more generally. 2. Base It on Production Costs We hear all the time about the electricity and equipment required to mine bitcoin. These associated expenses provide another means of determining the cryptocurrency‚Äôs value. While estimates of these costs are highly variable and inevitably inaccurate, Cambridge University researchers have compiled some of the most reliable data. Bitcoin Production Costs Source: Capriole Investments. Created with Data Wrapper Of course, bitcoin is a store-of-value asset and an alternative monetary technology. But few users are pricing bitcoin based on the latter quality. That‚Äôs why bitcoin production costs serve a purpose similar to those of gold: They set a floor on the price, which can help determine whether the underlying is undervalued. Historically, bitcoin‚Äôs price has tended to bottom out at around its production cost, as in the second half of 2016, the first half of 2019, March 2020, and the second half of 2022. By helping determine whether bitcoin is undervalued, production costs are a critical input to its valuation. But since they can hardly quantify the upside price potential associated with bitcoin‚Äôs monetary premium, they are also a limited input. 3. Look at the US Dollar So, how do we value bitcoin‚Äôs monetary premium? As an alternative monetary technology, bitcoin has to be assessed in the context of the prevailing monetary system: the US dollar. Real interest rates, money supply growth, and fiscal policy, among other factors, all influence bitcoin‚Äôs valuation. Elevated real interest rates and constrained money supply growth are indicators of sound monetary and fiscal policy. They help gauge whether the authorities are protecting the value of the dollar. Such factors should constitute headwinds for bitcoin prices. If policymakers are looking after the existing monetary regime, investors are less likely to look for an alternative. For Bitcoin Valuations, Dollar Policy Prudence Matters Sources: Glassnode, Google Finance, and Sound Money Of course, monetary policymakers often adopt profligate measures that debase the value of the dollar. The quantitative easing (QE) and other monetary stimulus of the last 15 years created low and negative real interest rates and rapid growth in the money supply. These were ideal conditions for bitcoin and fueled the crypto boom. Under tighter macro conditions, bitcoin is less valuable. Under loose conditions, it is more valuable. 4. Measure the Conviction of Bitcoin Holders Taking a more behavioral approach, we can also evaluate the underlying conviction of long-term vs. short-term bitcoin holders for clues to bitcoin‚Äôs value. The share of long-term holders tends to increase during bear markets and decrease during bull markets. Long-Term Bitcoin Holder Percentages Indicate Under/Overvaluation Sources: Glassnode and Sound Money This suggests that bitcoin is overvalued when short-term speculators hold more of the supply and undervalued when long-term holders predominate. Those accustomed to discounted cash flows, price-to-earnings ratios, and other traditional metrics may find bitcoin valuation methods unconventional. But unconventional or not, they offer a way to move forward. The outputs and outcomes may vary, but that is no surprise when it comes to emerging and potentially transformative technologies. Bitcoin‚Äôs many detractors could very well be right. Bitcoin and crypto in general could all end in failure, with an intrinsic value of effectively zero. But crypto advocates could also be on to something when they anticipate bitcoin becoming a global reserve asset. Few assets have ever sparked such divergent opinions. As the financial industry delves deeper into the crypto valuation question, we should remember that the printing press, the steam engine, the internet, and other revolutionary technologies have always been difficult to value, particularly in their early stages. But these innovations eventually transformed the world in ways people did not initially imagine. Crypto may do the same. Or it may not. We‚Äôll just have to see. All posts are the opinion of the author. As such, they should not be construed as investment advice, nor do the opinions expressed necessarily reflect the views of CFA Institute or the author‚Äôs employer.

During this time, the premier cryptocurrency has moved from trading around $37,800 to almost breaching the $39,000 price mark. Following this positive price movement, Bitcoin has recorded some impressive metrics, which could bolster investors‚Äô interest in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Coinbase (COIN) Up By 250% ‚Äì Here‚Äôs Why It‚Äôs Outperforming BTC And ETH Bitcoin Experiences Highest Profitability Level In Two Years Via a Friday post on X, blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock reported that 81.35% of all Bitcoin holders are currently in profit. This marks the highest profitability level experienced by BTC investors since December 2021, when the token was valued at over $50,000. Interestingly, Bitcoin‚Äôs profitability is likely to go higher, with several factors indicating the market leader may soon cross into the $40,000 price zone. Firstly, there is currently a high level of optimism regarding the approval of a Bitcoin Spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On Friday, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart injected much hype into the crypto community as he predicted that this potential approval order would come between January 8 ‚Äì January 10, 2024. Therefore, in anticipation of the massive institutional demand a spot ETF could introduce to the BTC market, investors are likely to start increasing their Bitcoin holdings, which could result in a price boost in the following weeks. Furthermore, the US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has made statements suggesting that there would likely be no more rate hikes in the coming months.¬†This development, if true, paves the way for Bitcoin, alongside other digital assets, to experience more price gains as increases in fed rate hikes are known to discourage investments in high-risk assets such as cryptocurrencies. However, despite these favorable indicators, it is worth stating that the crypto market remains subject to multiple forces, and all investors are advised to conduct proper research before engaging with the market.

With a notable 10% gain over the previous month and more than a doubling of its value over the same period last year, the markets valued Bitcoin (BTC) at over $38,600 on Friday morning. The alpha coin‚Äôs supporters credit its strong success thus far to the excitement around spot Bitcoin ETFs, like the one put up by BlackRock, which might be approved at any time. Related Reading: Ethereum ATH: Exploring The Possibility Of Ether‚Äôs New Peaks In 2024 During European morning hours on Friday, Bitcoin almost reached the coveted $40,000 mark, hitting $38,810 for the first time since May 2022. Expectations of increasing institutional demand have supported the increase, which is a continuation of a solid multi-month run. Data from cryptocurrency market tracker Coingecko indicates that the coin is up approximately 2% on the day, and sustaining a 3% gain in the last seven days. Expert Predictions For Bitcoin: What They Say Experts are becoming increasingly fixated on the ETF, as approval of the product approaches. An important piece of information comes directly from Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, who projects that the clearance date would occur between January 5 and January 10, 2024. This projection follows a string of purposefully extended deadlines, indicating a concerted attempt by the SEC to accept several ETF applications at the same time. Okay the window for potential spot #Bitcoin ETF approval is looking like its gonna be between Jan 5 & Jan 10 2024. I spoke with @thomasg_grizzle & @ScottW_Grizzle this morning and nailed this call. https://t.co/sOU950QlXj pic.twitter.com/y9JYdEpjNH ‚Äî James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 30, 2023 Seyffart‚Äôs analysis focuses on the timelines for Hashdex and Franklin Templeton, suggesting that the timeline to green light all 12 spot Bitcoin ETF applications may coincide between January 5 and 10. The founder and chief market strategist of NorthmanTrader, Sven Henrich, offered his predictions for the present and future of the Bitcoin market. He examined short-term forecasts, the structural soundness of the market, and made comparisons with past market patterns. BTCUSD currently trading at $38,806 on the daily chart: TradingView.com Henrich projected a possible shift to between $41,000 and $43,000, especially as the year came to a finish. He did, however, stress the need for caution because of the cryptocurrency‚Äôs association with more general market trends, particularly in the tech industry. Mike Novogratz, a well-known businessman and cryptocurrency advocate, expressed unrelenting optimism about the trajectory of Bitcoin and attributed his positive perspective to the much anticipated approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Ripple: Massive $300 Billion Transfer Sends Crypto Community Into Speculation Is $41K The Next Stop For Bitcoin? Novogratz thinks that Bitcoin‚Äôs value will go through the roof if big financial entities¬†like BlackRock and Fidelity start to use it, which will cause its price to reach all-time highs. The bitcoin community is growing increasingly optimistic that the price of the cryptocurrency may rise to $41,000 in the next few days as it approaches the $40,000 threshold. Because of the market‚Äôs volatility, traders are constantly on the lookout for the next move. It is unclear if Bitcoin will run into resistance or continue on its current upward trend.

While the recent resurgence experienced by the exchange‚Äôs shares coincides with the climate shift in the general cryptocurrency market, the latest price data reveals that COIN might actually be doing better than the market leaders, Bitcoin and Ethereum, since the turn of the year. Here‚Äôs Why Coinbase (COIN) Is Up By 250% In 2023 A recent report by crypto intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has revealed that COIN is amongst the crypto-related stocks enjoying the overall positive trend in the cryptocurrency space. This positive momentum recently pushed the price of the Nasdaq-listed Coinbase stock to an 18-month high of around $115. According to data from IntoTheBlock, the COIN shares have surged in value by more than 60% in the past three months. A look at the broader price chart shows that the stock has increased by approximately 250% year-to-date (YTD), outperforming Bitcoin‚Äôs and Ether‚Äôs YTD upswing of 130% and 75%, respectively. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Prediction: Crypto Analysts Reveal Catalyst That Will Drive Price Above $3,500 In their report, the crypto analytics firm highlighted that one of the crucial factors behind Coinbase‚Äôs increasing valuation is likely to be its trading volumes. Notably, the company‚Äôs trading volumes in the fourth quarter have already surpassed the figures recorded in the third quarter, even though there is still December to go in the current quarter. Additionally, IntoTheBlock cited the recovering market cap of the USDC stablecoin as one of the potential factors driving Coinbase‚Äôs valuation. The continued adoption of Coinbase-incubated Ethereum layer 2 network Base was also mentioned as another possible reason behind the resurgent COIN price. Meanwhile, Binance‚Äôs troubles in the United States have also somewhat benefited its biggest competitor, Coinbase. Last week, the world‚Äôs largest exchange admitted to being guilty of violating anti-money laundering policies in the US, leading to the payment of $4.3 billion in fines and the resignation of founder Changpeng (CZ) Zhao. As of the close of trading on Friday, December 1, the price of COIN stood at $133.76, marking a 7.25% increase in a single day. Bitcoin And Ethereum Price According to CoinGecko data, the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum currently stand at $38,744 and $2,090, respectively. Ether has not witnessed any significant changes in price over the past week, while Bitcoin swelled by more than 2.5% in the last seven days.

This optimism is rooted in the current Bitcoin put-call options ratio, a critical option market metric. Related Reading: Bitcoin Alert: $137 Million Moved By Long-Sleeping Whale, Market Braces For Impact Deribit‚Äôs Insight: Bitcoin Calls Outpace Puts Signaling Market Confidence Notably, options are financial instruments that give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call options) or sell (put options) an underlying asset at a specified price within a set time frame. The put-call ratio is used in options trading to measure market sentiment. A put option signifies a bet on the price of an asset falling, while a call option represents a wager on its rise. A lower put-call ratio indicates that more traders are betting on the asset‚Äôs price increasing rather than decreasing. Deribit‚Äôs analysis shows an increasing trend in the number of call options outstripping put options in Bitcoin‚Äôs options market. Luuk Strijers, Chief Commercial Officer at Deribit, highlighted that the put-call ratio for Bitcoin has consistently hovered ‚Äúbetween 0.4 and 0.5‚Äù throughout the year. This trend is particularly noticeable for options expiring in March and June 2024, suggesting that investors are increasingly using call options to position for a potential appreciation in Bitcoin‚Äôs value during this period. The put-call options ratio falling below one is a bullish market indicator, as it shows that call volume, or bets on the price increase, surpasses the put volume, which are bets on the price decrease. According to Deribt, Bitcoin‚Äôs put-call ratio currently stands at¬†0.42, as of today. A Surge In Crypto Derivatives Activity Meanwhile, November has seen significant activity in the crypto derivatives market, as noted by Strijers. The Deribit executive attributes this increased market activity to higher levels of ‚Äúimplied volatility (DVOL),‚Äù which have spurred ‚Äúopportunities and overall market volumes.‚Äù The expiration dates of the upcoming options, especially the significant one on December 29, are expected to maintain the heightened interest and activity in the market. With $5.7 billion in Bitcoin options and $2.7 billion in Ethereum options set to expire at the end of December, the market is poised for notable movements. Bitcoin maintains its upward momentum, advancing by 1.8% over the past 24 hours. With Bitcoin currently trading at $38,344, the asset has sustained the gains achieved at the close of the previous month. Related Reading: Bitcoin On The Brink? Analyst Predicts Soaring Open Interest May Signal 20% Price Correction Bitcoin‚Äôs trading volume significantly reflects heightened market activity, suggesting ongoing buying pressure.
