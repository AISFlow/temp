42379277,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82axN,1489012538,How Bitcoin Traders Are Preparing for the SEC's ETF Decision,"The world's bitcoin traders are getting ready for this week's decision by the US Securities and Exchange Commission on an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tied to the digital currency.  The agency is expected to make its decision by Friday. Specifically, the SEC is considering a proposed rule change by the Bats Global Exchange that would clear the way for it to list the bitcoin ETF sought by investors Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.  In the meantime, traders are preparing for what's to come – a process that, according to some in the market, means gearing up for the expected volatility that might follow, regardless of the SEC's choice.  Joe Lee, co-founder of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Magnr, told CoinDesk:  ""We're anticipating a lot of volatility and trading activity around the time of the ETF announcement.""  Investor and entrepreneur Vinny Lingham argued that while there's little indication as to which direction the agency go, the potential for volatility is virtually guaranteed.  ""Volatility is coming back after the decision is made,"" said Lingham.  Preparing for the storm  Lingham certainly wasn't alone in articulating this point of view.  CryptoCompare  founder Charles Hayter told CoinDesk that, from his perspective, overall volume should climb as well.  ""We expect volatility to increase and volumes too across all markets,"" he said.  Magnr's Lee similarly speculated that volumes could climb. He said that trading platform employees are doing what they can on their side to prepare for the decision's impact. Specifically, he said that staff will be on-hand to resolve any potential issues that may result in the expected increase in trade activity.  ""It's mostly business as usual, but with more hands on deck to ensure all of our trades go through as expected,"" he said. ""We'll be monitoring the situation closely either way to ensure our clients get a smooth trading experience.""  Many market analysts have asserted that traders have already priced in the ETF's chance of receiving approval, a development that has coincided with bitcoin's price repeatedly nearing $1,300 in recent sessions. After reaching these lofty levels, some have warned that prices could potentially suffer a pullback if the agency opts to reject this proposed fund.  Prepare for the worst?  While many traders indicated that they have braced themselves for volatility, some revealed they have specific plans in case bitcoin prices plunge following the SEC's decision.  At least one market trader has suggested that they are getting ready for the worst-case scenario: a ""no"" decision, followed by a sharp drop.  Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management, told CoinDesk that his team is planning to react accordingly should the situation play out in that way.  ""We're going to position ourselves to go short, perhaps massively so, if the market looks as if it's going to drop significantly based on a negative SEC decision,"" he explained.  Cryptocurrency fund manager Jacob Eliosoff took a somewhat different point of view, suggesting that he would look for opportunities amidst any possible price decline.  ""I'm waiting to do some buying on any major dip – I don't think we've seen the last of $1,000,"" said Eliosoff.

42379270,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82aoZ,1489008378,Could Smart Contract-Based Bribes Threaten Bitcoin Mining Pools?,"Could bribery payments issued via smart contract undo the bitcoin mining pool model?  A new research paper outlines a kind of attack against pools in which a malicious actor uses smart contracts, or agreements hard-coded onto a blockchain, to pay miners to essentially stymie their own efforts to solve the cryptographic puzzles at the heart of mining. Mining is an energy-intensive – and competitive – process by which parties race to add the next block of transactions to the network.  The paper, entitled ""Smart Contracts Make Bitcoin Mining Pools Vulnerable"", was penned by Yaron Velner of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Jason Teutsch of the University of Alabama and Birmingham; and Loi Luu of the National University of Singapore's School of Computing.  Made available  on 7th March, the research posits that, in the right scenario, someone could use smart contracts to guarantee payments to miners who, in that case, would then withhold information from the pools (or large conglomerations of miners) to which they are connected.  By doing so, the malicious actor effectively increases their share of any profits relative to the pool's total hash rate. Conversely, this attack could be deployed to break up an opposing pool to the benefit of another.  Yet the key is the use of a smart contract, the authors say, who go on to explain:  ""The use of smart contracts is crucial in order for the attack to be successful. Indeed, it is unlikely that miners would collaborate with such an attack unless their payment is guaranteed. Moreover, rewarding via smart contracts makes it possible for the attackers to remain anonymous, and prevent other parties from targeting the attacker (e.g., with a denial of service attack) and shutting him down.""  Why take this route? Those who mine on their own without a significant amount of hashing power run the risk of burning all that electricity with no profits to show for it.  So, miners congregate around pools, which concentrate that hashing power onto one point, splitting the block rewards received (if any) and distributing those bitcoins to the miners miner based upon the hash rate they contribute.  With a block withholding attack, a miner who has a big amount of hashing power divides it between two pools, withholding full proof-of-work solutions from one of them.  Yet according to the authors, it wasn’t until the development of smart contracts that this type of coordinated internal mining attack was possible.  Still, the attack isn't guaranteed, as some miners – particularly those guided by ethical considerations and those who don't want to rely on a smart contract to get paid (given that those contracts have failed due to flaws in the past) – might not want to participate, according to the researchers.

42379281,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82b19,1488996254,Rootstock is Fusing Lightning With On-Chain Scaling – On a Sidechain,"Another unique proposal aimed at increasing bitcoin’s transaction capacity – a core issue at the center of the long-running scaling debate – has been revealed in a new white paper.  The project comes from Rootstock, the startup known for proposing a sidechain aimed to one day port over ethereum’s smart contract functionality to bitcoin without impacting the main blockchain.  Technically, the new proposal combines in one project a number of technologies in development around bitcoin: sidechains, the Lightning Network and other solutions that achieve on-chain scaling.  While sidechain functionality has not been added to bitcoin yet, bitcoin security consultant Sergio Demian Lerner has still been working at building layers on top of Rootstock, including a compatible version of the Lightning Network, known as 'Lumino'.  Through this process, Lerner came up with something called Lumino Transaction Compression Protocol (LTCP), outlined in his white paper.  LTCP boosts transaction capacity by way of 'on-chain scaling', a phrase that seems to mean different things to different people. In this instance, LTCP uses clever compression engineering to allow for more transactions to be settled on the blockchain.  Lerner told CoinDesk:  ""The LTCP protocol allows the Lumino network [to] settle and top up payment channels while consuming very little blockchain space.""  Reaching more users  The idea to scale the bitcoin payment network to support more users is shared by other aspiring projects in the space, such as the Lightning Network, which could one day offer a top-layer to the digital currency, and MimbleWimble, which uses an entirely new transaction structure.  Meanwhile, ‘on-chain' scaling is a type geared specifically toward fitting more data directly into each block on the bitcoin blockchain. Even if bitcoin goes the route of scaling using 'off-chain' protocols, such as Lightning Network (and only settling on the bitcoin blockchain from time to time), on-chain advancements will help build out more room for users to actually settle those transactions, according to Lerner.  ""By increasing the on-chain capacity, we can reach much more people. As simple as that,"" he said. In the paper, he goes as far as to argue that the system could scale to meet the transacting needs of as many as one billion users.  In that light, once Lightning Network rolls around, on-chain capacity could still be an impediment to overall transaction capacity.  ""Because each active user will periodically either top up or settle his payment channels (to extract from or add funds to it), and these operations always require on-chain transactions, the number of active users is limited by the on-chain capacity, not by the off-chain capacity,"" Lerner explained.  Pruning old data  Rather than a UTXO (unspent transaction output) model, as is used in bitcoin, the ethereum-inspired Rootstock uses an account-based model, which is currently incompatible with bitcoin.  To add this functionality as a sidechain requires a soft fork, such as the one Lerner proposed last fall. Lumino, the payment channel network, and LTCP, the data-reducing protocol, are built on top of that.  'Delta compression  ', a way of reducing the amount of data, is LTCP’s main innovation. Compared to a throughput of roughly 2–3 transactions per second on bitcoin, the white paper claims that the protocol allows for something closer to 2,000 transactions per second on the sidechain, and 100 or more on the bitcoin blockchain.  So how does it work?  There is certain data that can be removed over time, as users refill payment channels. Say, to start, a user opens a payment channel with one bitcoin. When it runs out, the user refills it.  Essentially, with each new refill, LTCP looks at transactions that it was previously linked to and prunes signature data associated with those old transactions. It only needs to include the first transaction and the final transaction, while the signatures and other data from the middle links can be removed.  An image from the white paper of an example transaction sketches out the process:  Developers are now probing the limitations of LTCP, however, as revealed in a discussion after Lerner's presentation at the BitDevs meetup in New York City, with the possibility of 'selfish mining' being raised.  Further, one audience member noted that LTCP could cut back user privacy.  Lerner disagreed, countering that the Rootstock sidechain is not any less private than ethereum.  In cryptocurrencies, if users continue to use the same account for each transaction, then others can use a 'block explorer' to trace their transaction history. Typically, privacy-oriented users generate new accounts with each transaction to get around this privacy limitation.  Lerner suggested that users could continue to do this, or use so-called 'tumbling' services to obfuscate the origin of their coins.  However, when asked if this would impact the level of compression, he admitted that if users do generate many accounts, then they are not contributing to on-chain transaction scalability with LTCP.  ""It's a tradeoff,"" said Lerner.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Rootstock.

Dated 9th March, the proposal outlines a ""Commission to Study 13 Using Blockchain Technology in Conjunction with Paper Ballots in Maine Elections"", which would be comprised of nine state lawmakers, as well as representatives for the Maine Secretary of State and the Attorney General.

It’s a use case that has been largely pursued, in practical terms, by a number of stock exchanges worldwide for use in corporate proxy votes. Recent examples include a trial by Nasdaq in Estonia and a service launched by the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange.  In recent days, a South Korean provincial government tapped technology developed by blockchain startup Blocko to conduct a vote focused on community aid projects.

42379282,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82b3f,1488981608,"Bitcoin Startup Align Raises $24 Million, Rebrands as Veem","The company formally known as Align Commerce has raised $24m as part of its plan to simplify global fiat currency payments using the bitcoin blockchain.  Now rebranded as Veem, the company that aims to make bank wire transfers extinct, will first use the new funds to usher in two-way transactions in all of the countries it already does business with.  Then, later this year, the company plans to spend additional resources leveraging an upcoming hiring spree to accelerate the rate it expands into additional markets.  But perhaps the most dramatic change going forward could be the addition of a new blockchain as an additional payments rail on which Veem’s customers can transact.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Veem’s co-founder and CEO Marwan Forzley said that, while his company’s main payments rail continues to be the bitcoin blockchain, they are also able to send payments using Swift’s interbank messaging platform, and given sufficient liquidity, are actively exploring additional blockchains.  According to Forzley:  ""The concept here is to optimize the experience for our users based on what payments rail works best.""  The Series B investment was led by the recently launched National Australia Bank Ventures, with GV (formerly Google Ventures) and SBI Investment Co, also participating. All three investors already back payments platform Ripple.  Existing investors Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers and Silicon Valley Bank also participated in the latest round, which follows a $12.5m Series A in 2015.  Global growth  Founded in 2014, the San Franisco-based Veem has grown to serve 60 countries worldwide. It's service works by holding pools of currencies in accounts around the world and converting payments in fiat currency to bitcoin – which can be sent around the world almost instantly – then converting them to another currency in the receiving country.  But, of the countries it serves, only 35 are what Forzley calls “bi-directional,” meaning a transaction can be made in both directions between various national currencies.  As a result, over the coming months the founder expects that the remaining 25 or so nations will be converted to a two-way exchange, with additional nations being added by the end of the year.  The company is one of the most heavily funded startups using bitcoin to simplify global payments – an industry that is also being disrupted by Swift itself, with the interbank payments messaging service upgrading its own payment services just last month.  Though Veem isn’t currently disclosing the countries it will add next, Forzley hinted that the national headquarters of the investing companies could be seen as an indication of future plans.  In addition to the new countries and possible new blockchains, Forzley says Veem is currently hiring engineers and others to create a series of features aimed at ""substantially"" changing the experience customers are used to at a bank.  ""Bank wire is just not designed for the modern era and modern users,"" he said. ""So there’s an opportunity to team up here and build that for our user base.""  Brand as verb  Accompanying the cash infusion, Align Commerce decided to rebrand as Veem for multiple reasons.  At the time the company was launched three years ago, the original name was chosen to reflect the mission of “aligning” the payment rails provided by the bitcoin blockchain with existing payments options such as Swift and traditional fiat currency.  But as user growth has accelerated ""exponentially"" year over year, according to the CEO, the firm began the process of looking for a brand that not only reflected how customers use a product, but can be used as a verb.  ""Just veem it,"" is a phrase Forzley said he’d like to see become commonplace among his users, the exact number of which he didn’t want to share.  What does ""veem"" mean? Forzley defined the word in conversation with CoinDesk:  ""Veem is the fluidity and simplicity of moving money from one place to another.""

42379267,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82aiH,1488978034,Bitstamp Partners with Banking Giant for Bitcoin Investment On-Ramp,"European bitcoin exchange Bitstamp and French banking giant Crédit Agricole have teamed up to launch a new service aimed to allow bitcoin to be accepted by investment funds.  For its side of the deal, CACEIS, the asset servicing branch of the bank, will provide services covering clearing, depositary and custody of bitcoin bought in through the exchange.  The goal of the partnership is to increase capital inflows to new investment funds by providing an alternative funding method in the form of the digital currency. Fund promoters, working with CACEIS as a transfer agent, can start accepting bitcoin for fund subscriptions as soon as Q2 2017, the firms indicated.  Bitstamp CEO, Nejc Kodrič, sees the partnership as a foothold for bitcoin to be used for mainstream, legitimate investment opportunities,  “Bitstamp’s first partnership with a market-leading, asset-servicing bank like CACEIS means bitcoin investments can now be made within fully licensed and regulated framework,” he said.  As bitcoin gains traction, it's easy to see why some investors are picking up interest. In jurisdictions with capital controls, using bitcoin circumnavigates regulatory headaches and streamlines cross-border payments.  Joe Saliba, CACEIS deputy chief executive officer, said:  “Fund promoters are constantly seeking new sources of investment capital and by interfacing them with a regulated bitcoin exchange we are supporting their business development objectives. “  Bitstamp has been on forefront of digital currency compliance in Europe. In July of last year, the exchange received the green light from regulators to act as the first fully authorized payment institution in Luxembourg.

42379271,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82app,1488974411,Why Bitcoin Remittance Companies Are Still Shrugging Off Swift,"It could be said that Swift is under attack.  In a changing global payments community, Swift – one of the world’s largest financial transaction messaging mediums – has faced new criticisms from those who say it has failed to keep up with the needs of the global financial market.  Specifically, some believe Swift is proving to be inefficient in the settlement of cross-border payments, due to its inability to manage real-time settlement for any transaction amount and its lack of transparency in settlement risk and payment status.  To address this, Swift has introduced its Global Payments Innovation (GPI) Initiative, which – according to Swift – will allow for same-day availability of funds for business-to-business transfers within the same time zone, payment tracking end-to-end, protected remittance information and improved transparency of fees.  The first phase, which went live in January 2017 and is in use with 12 banks – including the Bank of China, Citi, Danske Bank and ING – will focus exclusively on business-to-business payments. Swift has also promised further enhancements to its cross-border payments system, possibly including the incorporation of a distributed ledger technology proof of concept, in future rollouts.  This move to reform its global messaging service, however, may be too little, too late, in its attempt to catch up toward resolving the global payment clearance, settlement and payment bottleneck, particularly for non-bank customers.  One demographic already working on these issues is the current and former bitcoin remitters, startups that are today using various blockchains to move money internationally.  One such firm, Align Commerce, has made an impression in the fintech world due to its $20.25m in funding.  The firm's CEO, Marwan Forzley, said he sees blockchain and distributed ledgers as a ""next generation"" opportunity – a car compared to the old banking horse and buggies.  Forzley told CoinDesk:  ""Our technology is built on bringing the benefits of new tech directly to the consumer as opposed to waiting on the change to happen through global bank adoption.""  The business of small transactions  Cross-border payments have traditionally been the weak link in the global finance chain.  Totalling $26tn in 2014, global payments are equivalent to more than one-third of the global gross domestic product. However, without any consistency or standardization among local infrastructures, most of these funds are locked in the modern-day equivalent of a message-by-bottle system.  To send a payment cross-border, a customer must find and hire a transmitter to handle the transfer, which would have contacts with financial institutions in both the transmitting and recipient countries. Further complicating the process, these banks may have their own intermediaries.  Each of the institutions handling the transfer charges its own fees for the service. The entire process can take up to a week.  While the corporate section of the global market – estimated at $15.7tn in 2014 – can negotiate costs to 1% to 2% of the total amount of the payment, small and middle-sized businesses and person-to-person transactions could see a surcharge of up to 15%.  This series of 'hidden fees' can affect those least capable to deal with it the hardest.  Should a customer hail from an underserved or underbanked community, he or she may not have access to avenues that would otherwise allow for simplified cross-border payments, such as using a transnational bank to transfer the payment using their infrastructure.  This leaves consumers and small businesses prone to international money transmitters, such as Western Union and SwiftPay, whose transaction fees can be both exorbitant and unpredictable.  The emergence of bitcoin remittance companies – which allows consumers to make borderless transactions at a low, controlled cost – has helped to mitigate this issue on a small scale. While Swift has promised to help make cross-border payments more transparent with the GPI, it offers no relief regarding cost for customers that have no access to fee negotiation.  ""The vast majority of the world's remittances are not done via banks, but by cash money transfer shops,"" George Harrap, CEO of Bitspark, told CoinDesk. ""This will not affect how they manage their business or transactions.""  Hong Kong-based Bitspark is one of the largest bitcoin remittance services serving Southeast Asia, and despite the lack of traction, it still feels it has the best long-term hand, if for a separate market.  ""Cost will remain the same as remittance companies batch payments anyway, so – potentially – reductions in wire fees do not affect companies who transfer $10m per transfer and draw down on this balance for small remits,"" he said, adding:  ""The wire fee on $10m is inconsequential.""  A continuing problem  Because of this division, as it is today, the Swift GPI is unlikely to influence bitcoin remittances in a significant way.  Alan Safahi, the CEO of ZipZap, which raised $1.1m in 2014 to fund the expansion of the company’s cash-to-bitcoin service, agrees.  ""ZipZap uses a combination of traditional (Swift) bank payment rails and blockchain technologies to find the least expensive and most efficient transfer option. The Swift GPI is primarily for B2B payments, so it will not impact ZipZap's current business flow,"" he said.  This, however, may change once phase three of the GPI launches.  While Swift intends the product to improve global payment transaction recording for its member institutions, it's feasible that GPI-inspired innovations may show up in other blockchain-enabled fintech applications.  For example, Swift is a member of the HyperLedger Project, whose Fabric project may form the underpinning for future cross-border frameworks.  However, as Swift GPI does not offer real-time processing, but offers real-time reconciliation of its 'nostro' account balances, GPI doesn’t address the needed changes to cross-border payments – particularly, for non-bank customers.  As Ripple stated on its Insight blog, GPI is more of an attempt of a financial giant to stay relevant than a true effort toward modernization.  The company states:  ""Swift's GPII does not address the antiquated infrastructure that makes real-time settlement a constant challenge ... it merely makes a minor adjustment to its current settlement requirements.""

In an email sent today to its mailing list, Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund (GABI), a Jersey-based investment vehicle that buys and sells bitcoin on behalf of investors, said it believes the market is now signaling a potential approval too strongly for its taste.  Ultimately, GABI said it believes ""it does not seem likely"" that investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss will receive approval for the vehicle, which they first filed in 2013.  GABI wrote in an email today:  ""Without the ETF launch, should that be the case after that deadline, and with the aforementioned issues in China, we believe the market will be short of a catalyst and will have trapped some overly optimistic long positions. We will continue to reduce our exposure into the decision date.""  GABI goes on to write that it projects a 25% chance of approval on the decision. Either way, sources tell CoinDesk a decision is likely to happen this week.  ""If it turns out we are wrong, and the ETF does launch, we will certainly miss a spike and will extend this month's underperformance into next,"" the statement continues.  However, even if the ETF does not launch, GABI is optimistic bitcoin's price will head higher – even with continued scrutiny on the market from China's central bank.  ""We think the ‘bull’ case for bitcoin will be considerably strengthened, and as such, we would expect a very protracted rally in which we will quickly seek to participate,"" the email reads.  Elsewhere, the firm discussed the results of trading decisions earlier in the year, highlighting how its performance has been affected by developments in China, and how it has shifted its strategy in response.  Launched in 2014, GABI received regulatory approval for its offering from the Jersey Financial Services Commission (JFSC). Principles for the fund include Jean-Marie Mognetti, Daniel Masters and Russell Newton.
