IOT's decision to go ""behind the grid"" is part of a larger trend within the cryptocurrency sector, according to a company statement.

Stepping back, the move is part of a broader trend where miners are investing more and more computing power in their operations. In order to boost their profit margins, they've also sought out cheaper and cheaper sources of energy. Washington state and Quebec have become choice destinations for mining operations, due to the cheap hydroelectric power each area provides.

The filing, published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), outlines a permissioned blockchain which, if implemented, would securely record and authenticate personal and business data, ensuring only authorized parties can access it. Further, the system would keep a log of everyone who accesses the data, according to the application.  The document proposes using such a blockchain as a way to combine existing data storage platforms into a single secure network, increasing efficiency by reducing the number of storage locations for a user's data.  According to the document, which was first filed in 2016, service providers and private individuals are increasingly using the internet to share personal and business records, primarily through dedicated web portals and email attachments. However, ""there are a number of disadvantages to using this type of electronic record sharing method,"" including having to repeat the process for each company and the risk of data corruption.  Using a blockchain would create a more efficient system, wherein an individual can store all of their records in a single digital ledger. Businesses and service providers would be able to access these records as necessary.  Notably, this would be a permissioned blockchain, the filing notes. It continues:  ""Embodiments of the invention utilize a private blockchain to store various types of records to be conveyed to the service providers. In this way, the individual or entity may securely store on the blockchain all records relevant to service providers, then provide the service providers with secured access to said records such that the providers may access only the specific records for which they are authorized, e.g. a healthcare provider may access only the healthcare records on the blockchain.""

42380545,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gNN7,1523555419,CabbageTech CEO Concedes in CFTC Crypto Fraud Suit,"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission affirmed its ability to regulate cryptocurrencies as commodities, after an alleged scammer gave up a legal fight against the agency on Thursday.  The commodities regulator charged Patrick McDonnell - doing business as CabbageTech and Coin Drop - with fraud and misappropriation of funds earlier this year. According to court documents, McDonnell allegedly marketed himself as a trading expert, accepted customers' bitcoin and litecoin, then absconded with the funds without providing them with trading advice.  On Thursday, McDonnell sent a letter to U.S. District Court chief magistrate Roanne Manne of the Eastern District of New York saying he does not have the resources or the ability to continue fighting the charges brought against him.  In his letter, he wrote:  ""I do not wish to put my burdens on the court and respectfully decline to answer Plaintiff complaint. I understand that the case will be placed into default and am not admitting guilt in any way. My personal finances are 100 percent exhausted which in turn will leave my family destitute if I miss anymore days/time from work.""  In his note Wednesday, the defendant called the allegations against him ""fictitious"" and ""crafted lies.""  The case could set a legal precedent for the treatment of cryptocurrencies. A U.S. District Court judge ruled in March that the CFTC could proceed with the suit, affirming the regulator's stance - first articulated in 2015 - that cryptocurrencies are commodities. Under U.S. law, any good can in principle be treated as a commodity, except for onions.  U.S. federal law treats cryptocurrencies in different ways depending on the context. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats them as property for tax-collecting purposes. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has said that certain tokens marketed through ICOs qualify as securities. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) treats businesses that handle cryptocurrencies as money transmitters, meaning they must comply with know-your-customer and anti-money laundering (KYC/AML) rules.

42380562,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gNfz,1523550654,NY Regulator Argues BitLicense Regulation Boosted Businesses,"The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) is taking steps to defend its much-contested track record as an early regulator of cryptocurrency.  In remarks at this year's Conference of State Bank Supervisors spring meeting Tuesday, NYDFS superintendent Maria Vullo discussed the agency's efforts to police the cryptocurrency space, touting the state's technology-specific licensing regime, the BitLicense, as an example of how her agency has contributed to the maturation of the industry.  Because the agency's role is to protect consumers, cryptocurrencies needed to be regulated, and these regulations, she argued, have benefited the space.  She told attendees:  ""The regulatory structure that we created for virtual currency has helped our licensed companies attract greater interest from customers, investors, and potential financial services partners seeking to pursue further innovation, while protecting market integrity by stringent standards applicable to all law-abiding business enterprises.""  Vullo said her agency held public hearings in early 2014, before she took over the top job, as ""the problems at Mt. Gox - then handling 70 percent of Bitcoin exchanges - continued to spiral out of control."" The regulator drafted rules governing virtual currency businesses and finalized the BitLicense in 2015.  The regulation helped ""insure that the competition among new entrants is not a race to the bottom."" She again cited the example of Mt. Gox, where ""fatal flaws"" caused investors to lose hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin - now billions, due to the higher exchange rate.  Vullo emphasized the agency's focus on consumer welfare and industry compliance, saying:  ""DFS and the states have helped set the standards through our application and examination processes to ensure that customer protection is taken seriously, and cybersecurity and [anti-money laundering] standards are respected.""  Vullo did not address criticism of the BitLicense, which many in the industry see as imposing sweeping, onerous requirements. Only a handful of companies have obtained the license, and New York State assemblyman Ron Kim submitted a bill in February to replace the framework. The bill remains in committee.  Kim told CoinDesk last month that ""one person, the superintendent from one state government agency, has way too much power over the current regulations, without any oversight.""  The Department of Financial Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42380548,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gNQt,1523539847,IT Giant Tech Mahindra Joins India's Early Blockchain 'Bulls',"Is India emerging as a blockchain trendsetter?  Certainly, the sector has been moving in fits and starts in what's becoming the world's fifth-largest economy. Despite a bearish outlook on cryptocurrencies from regulators, progressive Indian states and companies are charging ahead in exploring the applications of blockchain technology.  Now, there are signs that local companies are seeking to integrate blockchain platforms into major businesses. Announced Thursday, Swedish blockchain startup ChromaWay and Indian IT giant Tech Mahindra are joining hands to bring blockchain solutions to the Indian market.  ""This partnership represents an opportunity to leverage our open-source consortium database technology to bring real and measurable improvements to society by empowering individuals, fighting corruption and fostering collaboration,"" Henrik Hjelte, CEO of ChromaWay, said.  The project is also expected to build blockchain solutions for government agencies, a release said.  And this wide-lens approach fits with Tech Mahindra's interests, according to Rachit Batham, head of the company's Blockchain Center of Excellence.  In statements, he sought to portray the company as willing to invest in exploring how blockchain could be applied to existing verticals and new ecosystems, with initial exploration areas including banking, telecom and healthcare, along with public sector opportunities.  Batham told CoinDesk:  ""Tech Mahindra is bullish on blockchain technology, and is making focused investments in building sustainable solutions and platforms.""  Boon for Chromaway  Still, the announcement is a notable one for ChromaWay, which is seeking to position its Postchain technology and its unique combination of SQL database and blockchain technology in a crowded market for enterprise-focused software.  Launched last year, Postchainworks with established enterprise database systems like Oracle and Microsoft, or open-source databases like PostgreSQL, and already, the technology is being used in limited trials as part of a land registry platform in Sweden and India.  Andhra Pradesh announced a partnership with blockchain startup ChromaWay to pilot a land registry ledger last October  Tech Mahindra, too, sees the potential for government partnerships to boost its R&D efforts.  Already, the company claims its in talks with the Department of Industries (and a few other state governments) to discuss potential applications for reducing market friction.  Apart from land registration and real estate, August Botsford, technical director at ChromaWay, told CoinDesk that the potential areas of exploration for his startup include trade finance, supply chain management, logistics, maintenance and part tracking.  Market momentum  All this amounts to early signs that blockchain is gaining momentum in India in both in the government and the private sectors.  For example, the government think tank, NITI Aayog, said recently that it is exploring blockchain applications by developing other proofs-of-concept in sectors including education, health and agriculture. It recently revealed a blockchain solution it is working on, to curb the country's massive counterfeit drugs trade.  State governments such as the government of Maharashtra have also revealed five to six pilot projects to test blockchain technology, as reported by EconomicTimes in February this year.  In this way, Vivek Agarwal, global head of enterprise verticals solutions at Tech Mahindra, stated that blockchain can help address some of the challenges of Indian public sector.  Botsford sees the public sector having huge potential for innovative development in the country.  He concluded:    ""There are strong indications that empowering citizens and public agencies by delegating control over vitally important data to those to whom it is most important can help to significantly reduce fraud and increase efficiency.""

42380564,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gNjl,1523536857,Bitcoin Breakout: Price Jumps $1K in 60 Minutes,"Bitcoin rallied over $1,000 in an hour this morning, having spent a better part of the last two weeks trading sideways in a narrow price range.  The cryptocurrency clocked a two-week high of $8,055 soon before press time and is currently trading at $7,850, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. The move marks a 13 percent gain from the previous day's close of $6,939.  It appears short liquidation or unwinding of short (sell) BTC trades has played a big role in the sudden rally, according to some sources.  The cryptocurrency picked up bids at $6,766 at 07:00 GMT and scaled the $7,000 mark at 11:00 GMT – a move that seems to have triggered stop losses on short trades, as reported by WhaleCalls.  Further, technical buyers may have jumped in as the move above $7,000 also marked an upside break of the falling wedge pattern.  It's worth noting that, while it took two hours to move from $6,766 to $7,000, the next $1,000 jump happened in just 45 minutes.  The speed of the ascent should not come as a surprise as wider the range and the longer the duration of the consolidation zone, the more violent a breakout tends to be.  For now, it appears bitcoin's period of consolidation has ended with a notable bullish breakout. Next, a move to $8,500 cannot be ruled out if the cryptocurrency closes (as per UTC) above $7,510, confirming a bullish double bottom breakout.

42380551,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gNXB,1523534430,Carbon 'Stablecoin' Project Raises $2 Million in Seed Round,"Cryptocurrency startup Carbon has raised $2 million in seed funding, the company revealed to CoinDesk, Thursday.  Investors in the round include General Catalyst, Digital Currency Group, FirstMark Capital, Plug and Play Ventures and The Fund. Carbon did not disclose its valuation.  The investment round brings the project a step closer to launching a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency based on Hedera hashgraph.  So-called ""stablecoins,"" which maintain steady exchange rates with fiat money, have been the object of intense interest as well as scrutiny in recent months.  The most famous example, Tether, has been criticized for its opacity. While the company claims that every tether token is backed by $1 in bank deposits, it has failed to provide convincing evidence and was reportedly subpoenaed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in January.  Tether is ""the elephant in the room,"" said Carbon co-founder Connor Lin, that puts Carbon in a challenging position: ""how do you build up trust?""  Even so, cryptocurrencies' extreme volatility has made the prospect of a reliable stablecoin alluring, allowing the technology to satisfy ""basic economic needs like paying bills and buying coffee, not to mention more complex needs like loans and insurance contracts,"" says Carbon's white paper, In a statement to CoinDesk, the team added cross-border remittances to that list, too.  Trust in code  The problem is how to maintain the peg. Carbon's developers reject Tether's method of backing with fiat currency, opting instead for a kind of algorithmic monetary policy. (Basecoin has also developed a stablecoin without fiat backing.)  Lin told CoinDesk:  ""If we can create a mechanism that the Federal Reserve currently employs, [but] in a decentralized way, we don't have to trust a central authority. We can just trust code.""  This mechanism involves two tokens: carbon stablecoin, which is pegged to a value of $1, and carbon credits, which fluctuate in value in order to absorb changes in demand.  When the stablecoin's value falls below $1, an auction is held, and users willing to give up their stablecoins (thereby reducing the supply and driving up the price) receive carbon credits in exchange.  The next time the stablecoin's price rises too high, its supply increases, and those newly created stablecoins are given to carbon credit holders. The process is governed entirely by algorithms.  Decentral banking  Lin compares Carbon to the U.S. central bank's bond buying. The Federal Reserve uses these asset purchases to influence interbank lending rates and, by extension, the price of the dollar on foreign exchange markets.  For now, says Carbon co-founder Sam Trautwein, the goal is to maintain an exchange rate of $1. Eventually, though, he thinks that ""society can do better than the Federal Reserve"" and other centralized arbiters of monetary policy.  Carbon, in other words, acts as a proof-of-concept for monetary policy through smart contracts.  Lin said:  ""Obviously this is a really experimental, ambitious idea, but we think it's an experiment worth running.""  Carbon has decided to base their stablecoin system on Hedera hashgraph. Hashgraph is a distributed ledger technology similar to blockchain, but it dispenses with the block structure and the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, which requires electricity-intensive mining.  Lin and Trautwein told CoinDesk that the decision to use Hedera's network was based on its high throughput and secure design.  However, since Hedera has not yet launched, Carbon's roadmap is constrained for now.

42380560,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gNej,1523534400,Moody's: Blockchain Could Save US Mortgage Industry $1 Billion,"Blockchain could help cut costs and redundancies in the mortgage process, according to a new report from Moody's.  The firm touched on the technology's promise in a new in-depth report that analyzes the impact of new technologies on the U.S. housing sector. While innovation in the years since the financial crisis has transformed a range of industries, the researchers wrote, housing has been mostly untouched.  That suggests a sizeable opportunity for blockchain applications to ""streamline key mortgage processes, eliminate redundancies and reduce costs,"" the report's authors wrote.  For example, the tech could improve the monitoring of loan performance, the authors argued, while boosting the degree of transparency throughout a mortgage's lifecycle, allowing ""mortgage insurers to transfer discrete mortgage credit risks to reinsurers and other alternative capital providers on a cost-effective basis.""  Some of the most outsized benefits would come in the area of title transactions, according to the report, since blockchain platforms could reduce the number of necessary personnel and cut spending on commissions. A 10–20 percent cut in these expenses, the report estimates, would amount to $840 million–$1.7 billion in annual savings.  The report notes that some projects are underway to incorporate blockchain technology into the housing sector. It also references title registry trials undertaken by officials in Cook County, Illinois, and the city of South Burlington, Vermont.  The Moody's researchers do sound a note of caution, however, about the amount of data that can be processed at a given time through today's existing networks.  ""One of blockchain’s current limitations is the small number of transactions that can be processed within a period of time,"" they write, ""based on the restricted size of the blocks and the high costs of using the technology.""  The reference to block sizes appears to indicate the authors have public networks like bitcoin in mind. These are unlikely to be adopted in the near term, however, not just because of scalability, but because of regulatory concerns, which the Moody's report also highlights.  Regulatory agencies, it says, ""want to ensure that those solutions do not create new risks for individual firms or the industry.""

42380557,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gNZh,1523531427,Santander to Launch Ripple Payment App This Week,"Global banking giant Santander Group is reportedly launching a blockchain-based application for cross-border foreign exchange on Friday.  According to a report by the Financial Times on Thursday, the app, dubbed One Pay FX, is initially to be rolled out for Santander's customers in four countries – Spain, the U.K., Brazil and Poland.  The group said it expects to introduce the service in additional countries for small businesses in the coming months, and may also extend availability of the product to other financial institutions.  Built on distributed ledger technology provided by San Fransisco-based blockchain startup Ripple, the app is launching after two years in development and marks Santander as one of the first banks to offer blockchain-based foreign exchange payments for consumers.  As reported by CoinDesk, the U.K. arm of the Spain-based banking group kicked off the development process in conjunction with Ripple in 2016. At the time, the bank was trialing the application among its staff in the U.K.  The product also comes as a result of a continuing partnership between Ripple and Santander, which, through its venture capital arm InnoVentures previously invested $4 million in Ripple's $32 million series A funding in 2015.  Santander Group has also previously indicated in a presentation that the app is based on Ripple's xCurrent platform, a distributed network designed for instant cross-border transactions. xCurrent does not utlilize XRP, the native cryptocurrency derived from Ripple's blockchain protocol.  According to the FT report, foreign exchange transactions from the four countries initially covered by the app could account for nearly half of the volume of Santander's retail consumers.

42380563,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gNiV,1523529040,$7.5K Ahead? Bitcoin Price Charts Hint at Bull Move,"The stagnant bitcoin charts could spring back to life in the next 24 hours, with a bullish move possibly on the cards.  The cryptocurrency has been moving in a more or less sideways manner for over a week now and – currently trading at $6,848 on Bitfinex – is largely unchanged on a 24-hour basis.  However, the price range continues to narrow on a daily basis (as seen on the chart below) and a breakout appears to be imminent.  Daily chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  Falling wedge, a bullish reversal pattern, meaning an upside break would confirm the tide has turned in favor of the bulls.  Pennant formation, a bearish continuation pattern, characterized by lower price highs and higher price lows. A downside break would indicate resumption of the sell-off from $9,050 (March 24 high).  So, there are conflicting patterns on the daily chart. That said, the failure on the part of the bears to capitalize on the recent bearish outside-day candle could be an indication of an impending rally.  BTC suffered a high volume drop from $7,189 to $6,611 on April 9 (bearish outside-day), engulfing the previous day's price action.  However, the follow-through in the next two trading days has not been encouraging for the bears, given that bitcoin moved back well above $6,611.  The bear's weakness, when viewed against the backdrop of the basing pattern along the ascending 50-week moving average (MA), suggests there is scope for a minor rally.  Weekly chart  The previous two weekly candles show bitcoin's dip below the rising (bullish) 50-week MA was short-lived.  As mentioned, BTC hit a low of $6,611 on April 9 and is now trading above the 50-week MA of $6,791. So, a base may have formed along the key moving average support.  The technical set-up also adds credence to historical evidence that bitcoin tends to put on a good show in April every year.  View  BTC will likely break through $7,100, confirming a falling wedge reversal (bull reversal) and move towards the resistance lined up at $7,510 (April 3 high) in the next 24 hours.  The odds of a bearish revival would rise if the cryptocurrency finds acceptance below $6,600. Such a move would signal downside break of the pennant pattern, thus opening the doors to $6,425.

42380542,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gNLr,1523527207,Blockchain Startup Kadena Raises $12 Million in SAFT Sale,"Blockchain platform provider Kadena has raised $12 million through a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) sale.  Announcing the successful round on Thursday, the startup said that participants included Devonshire Investors, the private investment arm of the owners of Fidelity Investments, as well as SIG, Asimov Investments, Multicoin Capital and SV Angel.  Based on the SAFT framework – a kind of investment contract that acts as promise for the delivery of tokens at a future date – the round was limited to accredited investors, and comes on the heels of a previous $2.25 million SAFT sale that was announced in January.  The funds will go toward the development of the company's Chainweb platform, Kadena co-founder Stuart Popejoy told CoinDesk – specifically, to help build out its technical ecosystem.  The firm's Chainweb protocol aims to use parallel blockchains with shared Merkle roots to tackle scaling and security issues, as previously reported. The different chains can be dedicated to different use cases without congesting the whole network.  However, there are “a bunch of things that have to be in place” before the public protocol will be ready for launch later this year, said Popejoy, who was previously a blockchain developer at JPMorgan Chase.  To that end, Kadena intends to begin releasing tools for the broader community to test, including a formal verification toolkit to help identify bugs, he said.  “Formal verification is something that’s come up at various times in the blockchain discussion, usually after a huge ethereum bug,” he said, noting that smart contracts, in particular, often involve the handling of large sums of money.  Popejoy explained:  “As we can see bugs can have significant impacts. The Parity bug was just a bug … but it allowed people to lose millions of dollars. So what we have is formal verification, and what that does is the computer proves to you mathematically that the network has no bugs.”  Kadena demonstrated a working prototype of the formal verification tool in 2017, but is now preparing to release it to the public for developers to use, Popejoy said.  The Chainweb testnet is set for launch in August, while the full network is slated for release in December, he added.

42380547,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gNPd,1523524234,Police Abruptly Halt Chinese Blockchain Conference,"A blockchain-themed conference in Shanghai was abruptly suspended by police on Thursday.  The one-day event, dubbed the Global Fintech & Blockchain China Summit 2018 and organized by a business conference organizer called PTP International, was originally scheduled for April 12.  Yet around midday (local time) on Thursday, the morning session was halted by police, and all attendees and organizers of the event were removed from the venue. The afternoon session of the event was also cancelled.  According to the summit's website, the event was to feature keynote speeches, panel discussions and exhibits from financial institutions, government and cryptocurrency projects.  While the official reasons that led to the cancelation have not been released, rumors have emerged online and on social media site Weibo that investors had reported the event to the police because an initial coin offering (ICO) project that they had invested in, and allegedly lost large sums of money with, was present.  However, in a media statement addressing the issue, the event organizer denied the rumor and stated that the conference is complying with Chinese laws:  PTP International stated:  ""We are still investigating the reasons of the halt, and so far the explanation offered by the police is due to security risk.

42380550,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gNTP,1523521836,How Far Will Crypto's War On Miners Go?,"Can public cryptocurrencies stay public?  That's the simple question that lies at the heart of a complex debate happening across major cryptocurrencies, where developers from projects as diverse as ethereum, monero and zcash are up in arms over what to do about the arrival of a new form of hardware that could upend the delicate balance of their distributed communities.  Designed specifically to enable operators to earn a greater share of their networks' rewards, ""application specific integrated circuits,” or ASICs, have emerged to mine a handful of cryptocurrencies that were previously only able to be secured by those using GPU hardware.  At stake, however, is the very access and openness of the protocols themselves.  Stepping back, it's important to unpack just what occurs during the ""mining process,"" a somewhat complex phrase that denotes the practice by which anyone can theoretically devote spare computer hardware toward running and securing blockchain networks.  Ethereum, monero and zcash can all be mined today with GPU hardware, graphics cards sold at major computing stores and that are available for only a few hundred dollars. More expensive ASICs, however, are specifically designed for an optimized mining process, and that's at the heart of some of the complaints against the arrival of this new slew of products.  That's because, as bitcoin has proven in the past, GPUs won't be able to co-exist with ASICs, as their arrival is likely to push the hashrate to a level where other types of miners will become unprofitable.  And the threat and opportunity that lies ahead is now splitting cryptocurrency users, many of whom may have invested previously in products that are now effectively obsolete.  A miner going by the handle ""fpbitmine,"" for example, went so far as to accuse zcash creator Zooko Wilcox of not doing enough to support those who have invested in helping the network gain value.  “You are biting the hand that feeds you,” the miner wrote on a zcash forum, adding:  “ASIC mining acceptance would mean that every single miner that has supported the zcash network will be displaced and forced to either switch coins or invest in new hardware.”  The back and forth  As such, many miners are threatening to take their hardware elsewhere or else create alternate versions of the cryptocurrencies they're already mining, something they can freely do by cloning the codebase.  Last week, privacy-centric cryptocurrency monero executed a hard fork, a system-wide software upgrade, to remove the ability for ASICs to be used on the network. But in turn, three groups hard forked to create their own versions – monero classic, monero original and monero zero. (Each new software is compatible with and open to ASIC miners.)  The divergent ideas about whether ASICs are beneficial for, or a threat to, monero mirror the opinions of other cryptocurrency communities as well.  For instance, ethereum developers have spoken out against an emergency hard fork in response to ASICs, with its creator Vitalik Buterin even calling for a “no action” on the issue. Still, in response, one ethereum miner called Buterin's standpoint a “slap in the face.""  He wrote:  “Everyone that thinks they can possibly convince people that the community is against a hard fork to prevent ASICs are sadly mistaken.""  Echoing that sentiment, the vertcoin Twitter handle tweeted how it believes action is needed.  ""We are sad to see news of possible ASICs being created for ethereum. We believe that it is time to take a stand against monopolised mining,"" it said.  And the same head-butting is happening in the zcash community.  While a zcash miner warned on a forum that “there are consequences” for a crypto that fails to keep out ASICs, zcash founder Zooko Wilcox told CoinDesk that he believes forking away from ASICs “could even do more harm than good.”  Adding to that, IC3 researcher Phil Daian has said that anti-ASIC efforts are akin to censorship, and others have argued that such efforts increase the power of the core developer team.  But all these complaints to the anti-ASIC sentiment seem to be on the minority side of the debate.  As a way to measure sentiment, several twitter polls were conducted [1, 2, 3] that show a majority leaning toward anti-ASIC hard forks, a procedure that would require editing a crypto's underlying algorithm.  Do what you want  Yet, those on the other side of the debate aren't particularly fired up; instead, their comments feel like a kind of ""good riddance.""  For instance, speaking to CoinDesk, Rob Stumpf, the moderator of EtherMining, the ethereum mining subreddit, said, ""If a developer believes that he or she can improve upon [ethereum] and wishes to start their own fork, they can do just that.”  And monero core developer “rehrar” said during a recent call that there were “no hard feelings” toward divergent monero groups.  “It’s a mental shift for people, that they’re not used to yet, that the power is in their hands to have the discussions that they want to have,” rehrar said.  One discussion that this chaos has brought back to the forefront is ethereum's interest in scrapping mining by moving from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Buterin told developers at a recent meeting that ASICs would be flushed out with the upgrade so there isn't much to worry about (although there still isn't a date nailed down for that change).  Speaking to ethereum developer's interest in eliminating mining, Stumpf said, “Mining was always doomed from the start; it is just a ticking difficulty bomb waiting to explode.""  And Wilcox echoed this, telling CoinDesk:  “Maybe instead we should work on some other solution, such as switching to proof-of-stake, or getting major hardware companies like Nvidia and Huawei to sell hardware miners to anyone.”  Pseudonymous Monero Research Lab developer Sarang Noether even seemed to think the dip by between 70 percent and 80 percent in hash rate that occurred after the hard fork, was proof that ASICs were secretly being used on the network. And then they were gone.  Monero developer “hyc” told CoinDesk:  “The community is, as always, mixed. Most seem to recognize that the dev team has simply carried out its commitment to egalitarian mining.”  Cracks in screen image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,ETH | MINING | XMR | ZEC | FORKS,Rachel-Rose O'Leary,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/12/how-far-will-cryptos-war-on-miners-go,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a0e32b768376c8e3b10ed18c7d6312c5cb1ad608-1500x994.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a company announcement, starting from April 26, users registering online will not be able to send cryptocurrency assets or withdraw Japanese yen until their identity and address have been confirmed with the receipt of a postal letter from the exchange.  Similarly, paying for goods with bitcoin through bitFlyer will also be disabled until users have received a letter that confirms they have passed the firm's verification process.  The revised rule comes as a response to a report by Japanese media outlet Nikkei earlier on Thursday, which indicated that Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) has raised concerns over what it considers a loosely enforced ID verification process on the bitFlyer platform.  Based on Nikkei's report, the regulator said the cryptocurrency exchange has made it possible for users to start trading immediately after submitting a photocopy of their ID cards, while the platform has yet to fully confirm and verify users' information. As such, the financial watchdog is concerned that the platform could be used for money laundering activities.  Although it denies being careless in complying with know-your-customer rules, the exchange said it is cooperating with the FSA to strengthen its existing anti-money laundering measures.  The move comes at a time when the Japanese regulator has been scrutinizing domestic cryptocurrency exchanges regarding their anti-money laundering and business registration compliance.  Just yesterday, the FSA issued an administrative penalty that ordered Japanese trading platform Blue Dream, which is still in the application process for business registration with the FSA, to suspend its operations until June 10.  The FSA said the firm had violated customer protection measures by soliciting investors for its own token, ""BD Coin,"" while not making it known to investors how the price of the token is determined.  The order came just days after the watchdog issued two other administrative penalties last Friday, similarly barring two exchanges from operation for two months.

42380565,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gNhF,1523505647,Blockchains Alone Won’t Fix the Facebook Problem,"Michael J. Casey is chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor of blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.      Even before the questions began, one early image from Mark Zuckerberg’s Congressional appearance confirmed that the hearing would focus on all the wrong things.  The crush of photographers clamoring for a shot of the Facebook CEO was a reminder that Congressmen would frame their inquiry into the social media platform’s use and abuse of its users’ data around the man himself. We have been hurt, goddam it! We must find the villain and make an example of him.    These people need a consensus mechanism. pic.twitter.com/27LF8Bs60K        — Peter Van Valkenburgh (@valkenburgh) April 10, 2018      I do not wish to position myself as a defender of Zuckerberg here. I think he is responsible for building a truly odious machine, a black-box algorithm that deliberately steered human beings, lemming-like, into echo chambers of like-mindedness.  The platform he oversaw has killed inquisitiveness and open-mindedness, promoted form over substance, undermined the journalistic pursuit of facts and damaged our democracy – all in the interest of gathering and organizing our data so that we could be sold off as packages to platform advertisers.  My point is simply that, if not Zuck, someone else would have made a business out of user data in the same way. And unless we fix the underlying problem, someone else will do it.  What’s more, in calling for the CEO to take certain actions, politicians could do more harm to the core tenets of an open, democratic society, particularly their demands that Facebook up its censorship of hate speech and disinformation.  Zuck as data-lord is bad enough. Zuck as censor-in-chief is downright scary.  We need to tackle the root structural problem of the social media industry: the centralization of control over data and content and the reason why the internet economy has insidiously fostered it.  Here, the decentralizing ideas and trust-minimization principles that underpin blockchain technology offer glimpses of a path forward.  Blockchain's potential, and limits  At CoinDesk and elsewhere, I’ve posited before that blockchain and token technologies could help with massive challenges like “fake news,” the exploitation of user data and a rearrangement of Facebook’s business model to better reward users. Others have pointed to self-sovereign identity as the killer app to solve the Facebook problem.  And it’s not just talk. The tokenized, decentralized social media feed Steemit has been up and running for two years and a variety of decentralized journalism projects are now being launched on the ethereum-based Civil platform.  Their idealized vision is that of ownerless content platforms based on fully open-source software models. They seek to put users in control of their data, reward content providers based on fair, objective metrics of audience engagement and community priorities, and apply reputation tokens or other skin-in-the-game staking mechanisms to foster greater accountability and honesty in information production and distribution.  But let’s be clear: blockchain-based models are nowhere near ready to subvert the entrenched social media industry.  Any truly decentralized blockchain won’t have the on-chain capacity to handle the masses of data and billions of posts that any large-scale system would run. What’s more, on its own, the technology won’t protect us from many of the maladies of the current scenario.  One limitation can be seen with the upvoting model in Steemit, which rewards top voted stories with steem tokens and which invariably results in posts about Steemit itself rising to the top of the trending ranks.  The model, intended as a decentralized, censorship-free way to distribute funds for popular content while allowing advertisers a way to buy more favorable positions in the feed, appears to have created another self-reinforcing echo chamber. It’s not composed of Trump voters or Trump haters but of steem HODLers.  Moreover, as a number of critics of blockchain-for-social media point out, the technology on its own won’t protect the privacy of user data.  Once users place it in an open platform, any outside party can mine their data and do what they want with it. Even if user names are anonymized, artificial intelligence and network graph tools make it easy to uncover real-life identities.  Yet, as with much criticism of blockchain proposals, these objections make the flawed assumption that the technology is static, that innovative ideas aren’t being put to work on solutions, when there’s clearly a massive hive mind of invention underway.  It’s not unreasonable to conclude, for example, that something like a Lightning or Raiden Network will one day resolve scaling challenges, not only for transactions in currencies but also for transactions in data and content.  Meanwhile, projects such as Userfeeds.io, which uses ranking algorithms and reputation-based incentives to give intelligent weighted values to “likes,” “upvotes,” “downvotes,” are working on sophisticated community-led curation systems to deliver the broader content needs of a general user base.  Indeed, Steemit itself is working on solutions to encourage a more realistic, broader array of stories that are less about steem token navel-gazing and more about, well, life.  As for privacy, sophisticated multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs potentially offer an answer.  That’s what the founders of high-tech encryption provider Enigma argued in a recent blog post, entitled “Why Blockchain Alone Can’t Fix Facebook.” They proposed the development of “a complete privacy protocol,” a layered structure that includes both blockchain technology and “secure computation” to keep people’s private information obscured even as the system assures the accuracy of data transactions and currency transfers.  The core problem  Quite apart from these practical considerations, however, much of the debate over decentralized social media solutions misses the core point: the need for business models that are relevant to an online economy in which data is the central currency.  Blindly believing we were getting services for free, we’ve been “paying” the biggest internet companies for years, handing over troves of valuable data and then losing control over it as it disappears out of sight and is transformed by the platforms’ secret, proprietary algorithms.  Until now, the problem has been that, without a consensus mechanism to keep an accurate record of all the “transactions” in this new currency and thus to resolve our inherent mistrust of each other, we’ve been unable to install a decentralized, peer-to-peer economy around the valuation of that data.  That has left us dependent on the big data aggregators as trust intermediaries, allowing them to build that economy in their interests. (Quite apart from their public profile as social media, search or e-commerce companies, the Facebooks, Googles and Amazons of this world are in the business of data aggregation, valuation and repackaging.)  The first step in reducing the power of these internet behemoths, then, must be to use the kind of decentralized trust models that blockchains enable to make their data aggregation monopolies redundant.  Yes, centralization is more efficient than decentralization and, yes, economies of scale tend to foster monopolies in capitalist economies. But if communities of internet users have less need for centralized trust intermediaries, they can start extracting value from peer-to-peer exchanges of data.  That in turn opens the door to new enterprises to compete for those users’ business by offering useful services that let people build meaningful and fulfilling lives online while retaining control of their data.  If we want to solve the Facebook problem, merely pointing blame at a millennial tech mogul isn’t enough. We must build a new online architecture that contends with the fundamental problem of human mistrust in the digital age.
