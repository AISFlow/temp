42423970,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2j3Zh,1604530521,"Blockstream Is Working on Simpler, More Private Multisig Bitcoin Transactions","With Bitcoin’s long-awaited Taproot upgrade on the horizon, the engineers at Blockstream are working on a new scheme to improve multi-signature transactions.  These transactions, which require signatures from more than one private key to authorize spends, will stand to benefit from Taproot. This upgrade implements Schnorr signatures into Bitcoin’s codebase, a cryptographic signature scheme that will make creating and executing smart contracts easier on the network.  In a post-election day blog post, Blockstream engineers Jonas Nick and Tim Ruffing lay out a new multi-signature design that would reduce the technical complexity of multi-signature transactions in a way that still preserves privacy.  Nick and Ruffing, alongside French National Security Agency member Yannick Seurin, published a cryptographic e-journal on this MuSig2 design that is currently undergoing peer review.  Read more: Bitcoin’s Future: Exactly How a Coming Upgrade Could Improve Privacy and Scaling  'Non-interactive signing'  MuSig2 combines the strengths of the two leading multi-signature designs without sacrificing trade-offs.  Bitcoin’s oldest multi-sig trick, the 'CHECKMULTISIG' OP-code, for instance, requires less communication from the signers of a multi-sig transaction but is less private than the MuSig1 multi-signature scheme, which improves user privacy at the expense of adding extra steps to the signing process.  Specifically, MuSig1 requires the parties in a multi-signature transaction to communicate in multiple rounds to approve a transaction.  MuSig2 would retain all the privacy guarantees of MuSig1 while only requiring two rounds of communication between signers to approve a transaction (e.g., Alice generates a 2-of-3 multi-signature transaction she sends to Bob for approval; Bob signs the transaction, sends it back to Alice and the transaction is approved).  Read more: Bitcoin Developers Still Divided on Specifics of Taproot Activation  “It offers the same functionality and security as MuSig1 but makes it possible to eliminate almost all interaction between signers. With MuSig2, signers need only two rounds of communication to create a signature, and crucially, one of these rounds can be preprocessed before signers know the message that they want to be signed,” the blog post explains.  Besides improving general multi-signature wallets, MuSig2 could stand to benefit Lightning Network privacy and improve so-called threshold signatures that are often used by exchanges and custodians for fund storage.  If Taproot is adopted in the coming months, then Blockstream will replace the MuSig1 standard with MuSig2 in a code library for Schnorr signature schemes. The post also hints that Blockstream’s Liquid sidechain may run the Taproot code early to test the multi-signature scheme before it is ready for deployment on Bitcoin’s mainnet.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | TRADING,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/04/blockstream-is-working-on-simpler-more-private-multi-sig-bitcoin-transactions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5e4facfd1d559a519a8df13fd74473cbcf6da40-2560x1828.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405368,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMCoR,1604528594,FTX Looking to List ‘Beacon Chain’ Ether as Deposit Contract Goes Live,"Will an active secondary market emerge for ether (ETH) locked into Ethereum 2.0’s deposit contract?      That’s the question on the tip of most every trader’s tongue Wednesday after the release of the deposit contract by the Ethereum Foundation. As of press time, that contract holds some 5,000 ETH worth $2 million.      Read more: Tokenized Staked ETH Will Replace ETH – And That’s a Good Thing      Launching a derivatives market for beacon chain ether would provide liquidity for investors who can’t move out of staked positions. That’s because the deposit contract is a one-way bridge until at least phase 1 of Eth 2.0, also known as Serenity.      Yet, some exchanges such as FTX are looking at launching markets for “Beacon chain ether” (BETH) or tokenized staked ether, or ether that has been staked in the Eth 2.0 deposit contract. In doing so, a second ether asset could appear.    Beacon chain ether    One-way traffic into Eth 2.0 was a design decision made to stop the formation of a second tradable ether asset, Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake said in a tweet. Indeed, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin questioned who would provide liquidity for a token representing staked ether. “Just moving ETH over to the Eth2 chain has zero profit,” he said.      But that reasoning wouldn't necessarily stop exchanges from, say, spinning up a token functioning as an IOU for staked funds, Coin Metrics co-founder Jacob Franek spelled out in another tweet thread. (The idea has even stronger legs when one considers the decentralized finance (DeFi) token boom this summer.)      He said a secondary market for staked ether tokens would only be as deep as the amount of ether locked in the deposit contract. Its trading quality would also be dependent on whether market makers began actively trading the theorized asset.      The value of the token itself would be tied not only to the underlying inflation rewards stakers receive – between 8% and 15% annually – for depositing ether in the Beacon chain, but also to the inherent risks from trading a product on top of the ever-under-construction Eth 2.0 blockchain.      For example, penalties for failing to validate the new chain affect ether deposits. Those penalties would, at some point, affect how the staked ether token would trade.      Read more: Ethereum 2.0 Countdown Begins With Release of Deposit Contract      “The security concern is the principal agent problem because the people taking the financial risk are no longer the ones making the blocks and the people validating the blocks have no direct financial risk, only indirect,” independent cryptocurrency researcher Hasu told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.      A staked ether secondary market would probably be tied to the amount of ether held at a centralized exchange for staking. That could open up some exchanges to security concerns, Hasu said, who characterized the asset as “staking derivatives or staking securities or securitized stake.”",NEUTRAL,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/04/ftx-looking-to-list-beacon-chain-ether-as-deposit-contract-goes-live,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/78f62c4ef56f9ecf18b72e8f9aaf6b24496fd4dd-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $14,061 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 2.2% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $13,545-$14,232  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price made gains Wednesday, hitting as high as $14,232 around 17:00 UTC (12 p.m. UTC), according to CoinDesk 20 data, after a brief dip in earlier trading.      Read More: Bitcoin Dips as Trump Threatens to Stop Vote Counting      ""Bitcoin has recovered from its post-election drop, crossing the $14,000 level once more,” said John Kramer, a trader at crypto market making firm GSR. “The asset has done a good job of going its own way all year, vastly outperforming stocks.”      Bitcoin is up 90% versus the S&P 500’s comparatively paltry 4.5% performance in 2020.      Stocks are up Wednesday despite the lack of a confirmed winner as yet in the U.S. presidential election. ""Equities are unmoved by the uncertainty, rallying in the face of two possible outcomes,” GSR’s Kramer added.    The Nikkei 225 ended the day in the green 1.7% as positive economic data out of Asia is signaling economic expansion.  Europe’s FTSE 100 closed up 1.6% as tepid manufacturing data from October trounced investors’ concerns about Trump’s premature declaration of election victory.  In the United States the S&P 500 climbed 2.2% as tech stocks made gains despite apprehension over the presidential election.    Jason Lau, chief operating officer for San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin, said he is not convinced that bitcoin’s jump Wednesday has anything to do with the election’s outcome. ""While all eyes are on the election, it's too early to attribute bitcoin's gains to it in terms of the macro policy impact from either candidate,” Lau told CoinDesk.      Cryptocurrency analysts are also keeping an eye on the U.S. Dollar Index, a measure of the greenback’s strength against a basket of other currencies, which is up 0.15% as of press time. “The dollar downtrend is due to resume,” said Bill Noble, Chief Technical Analyst at Token Metrics.      Bitcoiners, as is often the case, remain bullish nevertheless.      “Too many people believe the election can stop the crypto uptrend,” Token Metrics’ Noble said. “A strong desire for economic freedom and the emergence of inflation drives the uptrend in crypto. Those trends are in motion, and they will remain in motion regardless of who occupies the White House.”      “My opinion is BTC will go up regardless of who wins this election in the short- to mid-term,” noted Alessandro Andreotti, an over-the-counter crypto trader.      One signal for bullish sentiment: Overnight, over 6,700 CME bitcoin futures contracts traded (33,500 equivalent BTC), 75% more than what has been observed year to date and more than double the volume observed since launch, according to a representative from CME.    Ethereum gas up, fees down    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Wednesday trading around $400 and climbing 4.6% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

Meanwhile, fees on the Ethereum network, required to conduct transactions and interact with decentralized finance, or DeFi, continue to be lower. On Nov. 1, average transaction fees dipped as low as 0.00229753 ETH.      Ben Chan, vice president of engineering for oracle provider Chainlink, says this data suggests despite the growth in 2020, there is currently less demand on the Ethereum network as interest in DeFi has seemingly waned. “What this could mean is people are less urgent to get transactions in, they're willing to wait longer,” he told CoinDesk.

42405363,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMClU,1604519691,US Prosecutors Seek ‘Substantial’ Prison Sentence for Centra Tech Co-Founder in $25M Fraud Token Sale,"U.S. federal prosecutors are seeking a substantial prison sentence for Robert Farkas, one of the co-founders of crypto project Centra Tech, which garnered multiple celebrity endorsements for its initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017. Farkas later pleaded guilty to fraud.      In a sentencing submission filed with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on Oct. 30, federal prosecutors said that “a substantial sentence of imprisonment would be reasonable and just in this case,” noting Farkas participated in a scheme that directly caused losses of tens of millions of dollars in funds from hundreds of victim investors.      In June, Farkas had pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to commit securities and wire fraud brought in relation to the fraudulent ICO.      As part of the scheme, Farkas, along with the two other founders, Sohrab Sharma and Raymond Trapan, pitched investors on a “Centra Card” crypto debit card purportedly issued by Visa or Mastercard. They also claimed to have 38 state money transmitter licenses and a CEO who, they said, attended Harvard. In a report from June, prosecutors said tnone of those claims were true.      While the sentencing submission notes Frakas has requested home confinement and community service, the prosecutors said in the document this would be insufficient given the nature and seriousness of his crimes.      Endorsed by multiple celebrities including former professional boxer Floyd Mayweather, who later settled charges brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Centra Tech project raised $25 million in its ICO and was one of many such projects that exploited the nascent nature of such offerings for illicit personal gain.      The document also said a “substantial sentence of incarceration is also necessary to serve the sentencing goals of adequately deterring criminal conduct.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TOKEN SALE,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/04/us-prosecutors-seek-substantial-prison-sentence-for-centra-tech-co-founder-in-25m-fraud-token-sale,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d5310bd46bb362e564a6f22f9afe5f9725798a9-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405379,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMCxI,1604519026,4 Charts Showing Why Financial Advisers Should Care About Bitcoin,"The traditional 60/40 portfolio (balancing equities and fixed-income assets) hasn’t been battle-tested for these unprecedented times. Central bank balance sheets are soaring, and interest rates are at record lows. This means investors are reaching far and wide for yield – oftentimes without a reliable hedge.      Advisers should consider talking to their clients about diversification, particularly in bitcoin. The cryptocurrency offers high returns that are uncorrelated with traditional asset classes. This diversification benefit means that bitcoin could be a key hedge against downside risk.    Damanick Dantes, CMT is a macro trader specializing in commodities, equities and crypto. He previously worked on the global asset allocation research team at Fidelity Investments. CoinDesk will host the Bitcoin for Advisors conference on Nov. 9-10 to explore the benefits of digital assets.    We saw this in October, when the VIX (a measure of volatility expectations) shot up 50% and bitcoin held strong, rising almost 25%. How’s that for a modern-day safe haven?      Companies are also using bitcoin to hedge risk. In September, MicroStrategy announced that it will purchase $175 million worth of bitcoin. The Nasdaq-traded company plans to invest up to $250 million over the next 12 months in a mix of assets such as stocks, bonds and bitcoin.      Investors could take a page out of MicroStrategy’s playbook. Even a small allocation to bitcoin could help offset the impact of rising inflation, which will erode the purchasing power of cash – currently yielding close to nothing.      There’s a good chance clients will put more of their cash to work in bitcoin – and they’ll seek help from their advisers: 76% of financial advisers surveyed by Bitwise Asset Management received questions from clients on crypto in 2019. It’s time to treat bitcoin as an asset class.      Here are four charts that illustrate bitcoin’s advantage for investment clients.      1. Bitcoin has risen in tandem with the volume of negative-yielding debt. This means investors of negative-yielding debt lose money when the bond matures. Rising fear has pushed more investors into bonds, causing yields to reach negative territory in some countries. But despite all of this uncertainty, bitcoin has maintained its luster.      2. Bitcoin has a weak correlation with traditional asset classes. Simply put, bitcoin could provide a useful hedge if stocks fall. It can even work as a hedge against commodity and currency risk.      3. Investors are highly compensated for the risk involved in holding bitcoin. The Sharpe ratio is a measure of risk-adjusted returns. So, despite higher volatility, bitcoin was still able to outperform traditional asset classes in recent years.      4. Bitcoin is becoming more popular in developing countries. Consumers across the world are using bitcoin for payment transactions and remittances. This is great for long-term investors holding bitcoin as both an international store of value and medium of exchange.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | RESEARCH,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/04/4-charts-showing-why-financial-advisers-should-care-about-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aa2c50659e67015397fa095febe2497bee1320c6-1420x1133.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405362,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMCkV,1604511466,Blockchain Bites: Ethereum 2.0’s Deposit Contract Goes Live as ETH Miner Revenues Dwindle,"Predictive markets rollicked with U.S. ballot counting. Two more crypto payments cards are expected to market. Nearly $1 billion worth of BTC moved from a long-dormant wallet potentially connected with the shuttered Silk Road exchange.    Top shelf    Staking begins Ethereum 2.0’s deposit contract is now live, as of 15:00 UTC. According to developer Afri Schoedon, the deposit contract (a bridge between the forthcoming proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain and the current proof-of-work (PoW) mainchain) is the first physical implementation of Eth 2.0 for everyday users. On a practical level, Ethereum stakers can now begin depositing the 32 ether (ETH) required to stake on Eth 2.0. Once 16,384 validators have deposited funds equivalent to a total of 524,288 ETH into the contract, the Beacon chain – the spine of Ethereum 2.0’s multiple blockchain design – will kick into action in what is called the ""genesis"" event of Ethereum 2.0. That event is expected within the next few weeks.      On the road again A wallet possibly belonging to early dark net market Silk Road moved almost $1 billion worth of bitcoin early on Wednesday, according to blockchain intelligence firm Elliptic. Nearly 70,000 BTC were transferred to an unknown wallet. This is the first transaction from the address since 2015 when it transferred 101 BTC to BTC-e – a now-shuttered cryptocurrency exchange allegedly favored by money launderers, per the post. ""These funds likely originated from the Silk Road,"" Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic noted in a LinkedIn post, adding that the coins may have been moved by imprisoned Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht or a Silk Road vendor.      Crypto cards ZenGo, a wallet company, will be the latest to join Visa’s Fast Track program, with plans of launching a crypto-integrated payment card for the U.S. in early 2021. Using multi-party computation (MPC), ZenGo’s wallet, and eventual card, will allow users to convert their cryptocurrency into fiat so it can be spent in the Visa network and withdrawn from ATMs – without having to put their cryptographic keys into third-party custody. Visa’s Fast Track program has previously sponsored Bitcoin’s Lightning Network and rewards app Fold. Separately, China’s UnionPay, the world’s biggest credit and debit card company, has teamed up with a Korean payments firm to offer its Paycoin cryptocurrency for an upcoming virtual card offering.      Difficulty drop Bitcoin’s mining difficulty dropped by more than 16% in its latest programmatic adjustment, the largest percentage decrease since the advent of ASIC mining machines in late 2012. Now at its lowest level since June, a drop in difficulty, preceded by the end of China’s rainy season, bitcoin miners are expected to see increased profits. Margins “for efficient miners will significantly widen,” John Lee Quigley, director of research at HASHR8, wrote, adding that less efficient miners will be able to mine profitably again. Mining difficulty is a measure of the amount of resources required to compete for mining fresh bitcoin, which changes roughly every two weeks based on changes to the total estimated hashpower consumed.      Layer1 lawsuit Bitcoin miner Layer1 Technologies is being sued by a co-founder who claims he invested millions of dollars and was then forced out of the firm. In a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in the Western District of Texas Pecos Division, the plaintiff, Jakov Dolic, claims he co-founded Layer1 with its CEO Alexander Liegl, with the assumption the firm would be able to raise $50 million from investors for a bitcoin mining facility. Though the investments never arrived. Dolic said he invested $16.24 million of his own funds to purchase a power substation as well as a further $3.5 million to expand the power facility – and now says the funds should be refunded, per a contractual agreement.

Ethereum users paid $57.49 million in transaction fees in October – down 65% from September's record monthly tally of $166.39 million, according to data source Glassnode. Further, the maximum ""gas"" price declined from 5.18 million gwei to 0.6 million gwei in October, according to data source Bitquery. ""Transaction costs declined as volumes on decentralized exchanges dropped, reducing demand for network's bandwidth,"" Alex Mashinsky, CEO and founder of crypto lender Celsius, told CoinDesk. Trading volume on decentralized exchanges fell by nearly 25% to $19.4 billion in October to register the first monthly decline since April.    At stake    What happens to the prediction markets? With the U.S. presidential election hanging in the balance, one thing has become clear: The primary sources for predictive election analysis – mainstream media and pollsters – will see their worth and trust degrade following a significant miscalculation leading up to Nov. 3.      What was predicted to be a possible blowout election for former Vice President Joseph Biden has turned into a nail-biting count in a few swing states. With clear “paths to victory” giving way to “toss ups,” many in the crypto industry turned their attention to predictive markets instead. The theory hinges on the bet that those with “skin in the game” (re: cold, hard cash) might yield greater insight.      In the lead up to the election, CoinDesk reported that volumes on decentralized crypto prediction markets boomed. Polymarket, a non-custodial platform where users place bets in the dollar-backed stablecoin USDC, saw volumes surge from zero to almost $3 million in a three-week span. Other crypto-based platforms, like YieldWars and Augur also began attracting attention, after long periods of dormancy.      Of course, the interest in trustless betting occurred amid a greater surge in use of centralized platforms like PredictIt. More than $1 billion had been locked into various prediction markets seeking to determine who will enter the Oval Office come January.      In the tumult of state-by-state ballot counts, prediction markets saw many take bets that President Donald Trump would keep his office – reversing a trend that previously favored Biden.      Noted industry venture capitalist Nic Carter tweeted last night that “trump is way overpriced at 68c” on FTX’s in-house prediction market. $TRUMP, a bet that the U.S. president would prevail ultimately crossed $.80 before tanking by press time.      All this is to say, election oddsmakers are just as fickle as the polls, though in different ways. In an election where crypto largely stayed out of the picture – both as a matter of candidate mandates and as a figure of political contributions – betting markets are just another alpha-seeking avenue.      Prediction markets are more entertainment than anything, Carter said over Telegram. “Generally though they are a useful albeit lossy compression of news, especially in volatile situations that are hard to parse (like last night).”      “Betting markets are not great barometers. I went to several PredictIt meet-ups in 2016. The big guns were daytraders who just wanted to day trade more. There is no secret sauce there. Sometimes they're right, sometimes they're wrong, but oracular they are not,” NBC News reporter Ben Collins weighed in.      Even less certain? The future of decentralized prediction markets.      YieldWars’ pseudonymous co-founder, Owl, previously told CoinDesk that the sudden rise in trading volume was to be expected, given the weight of the election. Though it’s unclear if this will last.      “Crypto-based prediction markets should be flourishing on blockchain right now but have failed to deliver up to this point. The election has breathed life into prediction markets but what is going to happen when it ends? Are people going to be as enthusiastic about them?” Owl said.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/04/blockchain-bites-ethereum-20s-deposit-contract-goes-live-as-eth-miner-revenues-dwindle,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aa4b8aa93e6af1496c1f45f95350e295a627228d-2000x1500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Feels good to finally bootstrap Ethereum's long-awaited proof-of-stake consensus.”      Read more: Everything You Need to Know About Ethereum 2.0      On a practical level, Ethereum stakers can now begin depositing the 32 ether (ETH) required to stake on Eth 2.0. Once 16,384 validators have deposited funds equivalent to a total of 524,288 ETH into the contract, the Beacon chain – the spine of Ethereum 2.0’s multiple blockchain design – will kick into action in what is called the “genesis” event of Ethereum 2.0. That event is expected within the next few weeks.      Stakers will begin earning inflation rewards after the genesis event by placing their ether as collateral on Eth 2.0. Staking rewards are reasonably high compared to other investments coming in between 8%–15% annually. And that’s for a good reason: Not only is there software risk, but the deposit contract to Eth 2.0 is a one-way bridge – at least for now.    Ethereum 2.0’s deposit contract launch: The next stage    On a larger level, the deposit contract and soon-to-launch Beacon chain represent a critical step toward a future that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin foresaw some seven years ago: the creation of and need for a generalized, Turing-complete blockchain.      That vision has rolled out in stages, not to mention fits and starts. Buterin and other developers executed a four-part release of Eth 2.0: Frontier, Homestead, Metropolis and Serenity.      Each successive phase added new features for the current mainchain and future PoS blockchain through what are called hard forks, or backwards-incompatible code alterations.      For example, the latest Istanbul hard fork in January 2020 created a bridge for the Eth1.x blockchain to speak with equihash-based blockchains such as Zcash.      Read more: It’s Time to Launch the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain      Serenity, the more formal name for Eth 2.0, is the most ambitious and contentious of the four hard forks. In fact, it's being tackled in multiple parts: Phase 0 with the Beacon chain, phase 1 with sharding, Phase 1.5 with scaling improvements; and, if necessary, a final phase 2 (Although the latter two phases have yet to be entirely worked out).      Developers have conducted limited dry runs of phase 0 over the last year with single-client and multi-client testnets in an effort to nail the final launch, venture studio ConsenSys CEO Joe Lubin told CoinDesk in an email. The final testnet, Medalla, launched in September and has remained relatively stable.      “We’ve hardened Ethereum 2.0 as much as we can with simulated test environments, formal verifications, and audits. We are incredibly excited to see the community galvanize around the first phase of Eth2, now with real value at stake,” Lubin said.      But now all eyes rest on the mainnet deposit contract and Beacon chain, ConsenSys Eth 2.0 developer Ben Edgington told CoinDesk in a message.      “Deployment of the deposit contract is the point of no return for Eth2. We have no choice now but to see this thing through right to the end. After 2.5 years working on this, I am incredibly excited about where we are, and what's yet to come,” Edgington said.

42405376,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMCyH,1604502616,"First Mover: Just Another Day for Bitcoin as US Election Slides Into Discord, Division","Bitcoin (BTC) was lower, searching for direction as uncertainty over U.S. election results hung over global markets. Prices were down about 2.2% to about $13,700, staying roughly in their range over the past week.      With major states yet to be called in the U.S. presidential race and Republican incumbent Donald Trump accusing Democrats of trying to ""STEAL"" the election, the early read is that bitcoin prices are reflecting an increased likelihood of prolonged uncertainty or political gridlock that might hamper a quick economic recovery.      In traditional markets, yields on U.S. Treasury bonds fell by 0.11 percentage point, the most since April, signaling a shift toward risk aversion, or maybe a tempered expectation of outsize U.S. government borrowing. U.S. stock futures swung between gains and losses. The U.S. dollar was higher in foreign exchange markets. Gold weakened 0.7% to $1,895 an ounce.      ""With millions of votes in battleground states still being counted, it’s clear that the election is turning out to be messier and more drawn-out than Wall Street had hoped,"" according to Bloomberg News.    Market moves    The U.S. presidential election is still in flux the morning after and might be for several days.      In some ways, the prolonged uncertainty might have been entirely expected given how contentious the campaign has been, with a U.S. electorate that looks as divided as ever though apparently quite evenly split. But in other ways, the result was a short-term surprise for markets given investor expectations in recent weeks for a ""blue wave"" of Democratic victories that clearly did not materialize.      What's known is that the lack of a clear verdict represents what many investors feared would be a worst-case scenario for global markets.      Here are a few takeaways for what it means for bitcoin traders:      1) Crypto traders playing in prediction markets appear to see Democratic challenger and former Vice President Joe Biden heading for a win:      2) The ""reflation trade"" – where investors expected a quick economic recovery with ample government stimulus – now appears less likely. Democrats held the U.S. House of Representatives and Republicans are expected to hold the U.S. Senate, which could lead to disagreement over the size of a multitrillion-dollar coronavirus stimulus package whoever wins the presidency. That might be bad for bitcoin, since many investors see the cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at the forecasting firm Pantheon, told clients in an email early Wednesday: ""With Republicans still in charge in the Senate, we’d be surprised to see a stimulus bill early next year much in excess of $500B, far less than the $2T we expected if Democrats had won.""      3) In some ways, the status of the presidential race appears in line with what many investors viewed as the worst-case scenario: an uncertain outcome with the potential to drag on. Trump says he wants the vote counting to stop, possibly seen as an admission that he suspects the final tally might reveal him to be a loser, and says he's going to take the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court. Given Trump's known combativeness and willingness to press for every advantage no matter how dubious, it could get ugly. That might mean markets trade for a while in a risk-off mood. In March, bitcoin prices tanked along with traditional markets when the initial coronavirus spread led investors to hunker down.      4) Based on election night trading, it appears that crypto traders see a Biden win as more favorable for bitcoin than a Trump win. That might be due to the expectation that Trump's protectionist trade policies and antagonism toward China would, all things being equal, lead to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the short term. ""There appeared to be an inverse relationship between Trump’s winning odds and bitcoin’s price,"" wrote the cryptocurrency-analysis firm IntoTheBlock.      5) Market watchers may now start looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's regularly scheduled meeting on Thursday. No action is expected, but Chair Jerome Powell might use the occasion to stress his readiness to intervene in markets if the election uncertainty causes investors to lose nerve. That could mean more stimulus, in a year when the Fed has already expanded its balance sheet by three-quarters to more than $7T. And investor expectations that the stimulus will eventually lead to inflation has helped bitcoin prices to almost double this year.      6) As chronicled by CoinDesk's Nikhilesh De in an election-night live blog, several key crypto-friendly or at least crypto-familiar candidates won election to U.S. legislative seats. They included Senators Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Mark Warner of Virginia, as well as Representative Darren Soto of Florida. The races could have implications for crypto laws and regulations over the next several years as the industry matures. De's primer on races to watch is here.    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin fell Wednesday alongside traditional markets after President Trump alleged “fraud” in the presidential election and pledged to stop vote counting.      The fall reversed a rally to $14,000 seen late on Tuesday, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      The cryptocurrency had begun losing ground during the early Asian trading hours after media reports projected a victory for Trump in key states such as Florida, dashing hopes for a Democratic sweep and a bigger fiscal stimulus package under Biden's leadership.      But the latest assessment is that Biden likely wins if he carries two of the five states still too close to be called: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia and North Carolina, and prediction markets are giving him the nod.       Bitcoin's price sell-off accelerated as Trump's threat to stop vote counting ramped up political uncertainty and sent a tremor through traditional markets. ""We want the voting to stop,"" Trump said without evidence. ""This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country.""      That last statement might be one that all voters could agree on.      - Omkar Godbole    What's hot    DeFi sell-off continues as index futures retrace to June levels (CoinDesk)      Ethereum fees plumeted 65% in October, following DeFi volumes back to Earth (CoinDesk)      Binance crypto exchange recovers $344K from scam DeFi project that launched on its platform (CoinDesk)      Nearly $1B in bitcoin moves from wallet linked to Silk Road (CoinDesk)    Analogs  The latest on the economy and traditional finance    Cruise-industry group extends suspension of U.S. operations through Dec. 31 (Reuters)      Copper miner Freeport-McMoran, based in Phoenix, Arizona, considers getting rid of headquarters, arguing that staff are ""showing we can get the work done remotely"" (WSJ)      Chinese President Xi Jinping says in high-profile speech to Communist Party's Central Committee that country's economy can double in size over next 15 years (Bloomberg)    Tweet of the Day",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/11/04/first-mover-just-another-day-for-bitcoin-as-us-election-slides-into-discord-division,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/141fb1a6cc3a58ffb86fffae6edf61d29dcd734f-1350x913.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Of the current decentralized options, Chainlink has surged in popularity in recent months, with Decrpyt reporting this week that 29 projects integrated with Chainlink oracles last month alone.      “The oracle is arguably the most important piece of any DeFi application,” he said. “More importantly, the oracle needs to be fully permissionless to be secure.”      But is there room to compete with Chainlink in the current market?      “There are so many different types of attacks on oracles we have to take into account and that’s the scary part,” Huilgolkar said. “For example, Chainlink got attacked a couple of months back and the validators lost a quarter-million dollars. We have to make sure that doesn’t happen and everyone is protected.”      Read more: Chainlink Up Nearly 1,000% Since ‘Black Thursday’ Crash      Huilgolkar said the Razor team is building towards a “truly decentralized oracle solution” with the new funding. He added that Razor developers have designed a dispute-resolution mechanism so that in the case of an attack, the attacker is sure to lose in the dispute round. This, he says, solves for the trade-off between speed and security of a fully decentralized system.      Razor Network is set to launch in 2021 for developers to create “state-of-the-art dapps,” the firm said in a press release.

In an announcement provided to CoinDesk on Thursday, Binance said it has gained custody of an estimated 99.9% of $345,000 worth of cryptocurrency stolen by purported automated market maker Wine Swap in October.  Having raised the funds at launch on Binance Smart Chain in October, the operator fled with users' cryptocurrency ""within an hour,"" Binance said.  The so-called exit scam was executed by moving the 19 different cryptocurrencies held in Wine Swap's address ""0xa1eaB5F255DD77fED0D8ea81748422ca7ab0eDc4"" to a personal address belonging to the bad actor: ""0x4BA023aA9196a354C008aD595F67e268420b7005"".  The various coins were moved via cross-chain transfers from Binance Smart Chain to Binance Chain and then to Ethereum, according to Binance.  A small portion of the funds was moved to two exchanges, as well as Binance Bridge, a service that provides access to inter-blockchain liquidity for decentralized applications on Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain.  The Binance said its security team closely followed the transactions and managed to identify the malicious actor. By then, the scammer had nearly converted all of the funds into stablecoins, as well as Binance coin (BNB), ether (ETH) and Chainlink's LINK token.  After being contacted by Binance, the scammer returned the funds to the exchange.  ""Analysis of the transfers to and from Wine Swap allowed us to identify which addresses fell victim to the scam and calculate exactly how much was owed to them,"" the exchange said.  Binance now plans to refund the victims' addresses ""within the next several days.""  Binance had seen some criticism over the fact that the scam project was launched on its platform.  CoinDesk asked the exchange if it had reported the scammer to law enforcement, but a reply hadn't been received by press time.

42433048,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2t5h,1604487415,Nearly $1B in Bitcoin Moves From Wallet Linked to Silk Road,"A wallet possibly belonging to early dark net market Silk Road moved almost $1 billion worth of bitcoin early on Wednesday, according to blockchain intelligence firm Elliptic.    Bitcoin address ""1HQ3Go3ggs8pFnXuHVHRytPCq5fGG8Hbhx"" transferred 69,369 BTC to an unknown wallet. The transaction was also noted by Twitter bot @Whale_alert 11 hours ago.  ""These funds likely originated from the Silk Road,"" Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic noted in a LinkedIn post, adding the coins may have been moved by imprisoned Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht or a Silk Road vendor.  This is the first transaction from the address since 2015 when it transferred 101 BTC to BTC-e – a now-shuttered cryptocurrency exchange allegedly favored by money launderers, per the post.  Ulbricht – who operated under the pseudonym Dread Pirate Roberts – operated the dark net market website Silk Road from 2011 until his arrest in 2013 and is currently serving a life sentence.  As such, it's highly unlikely Ulbricht executed the transaction.  The bitcoin trove left Silk Road’s wallet back on May 6, 2012, but may have been moved to stay up to date with changes to the Bitcoin network.  Robinson said in the post that an encrypted file containing what are claimed to be the cryptographic keys to the coins has been circulating on hacker forums.  If the password has been cracked, then a hacker may have moved the stash or its owner moved them to avoid this happening.  Silk Road, which combined two privacy-preserving technologies – bitcoin and Tor – to enable anonymous trade of illicit goods and services likely earned around 614,000 BTC in commissions.  Of these, 174,000 BTC were seized from Ulbricht by the FBI when he was arrested in 2013.  Robinson believes the remaining 440,000 bitcoins, now worth some $6 billion, may have been used by Ulbricht to fund expenses associated with running the marketplace.  Big on-chain transactions related to malicious entities often raise concerns in the market. While bitcoin is down over 2% on the day at press time, those losses look to have been fueled by uncertainty around the U.S. election.

(CNN currently has the tally at 205 for former Vice President Joe Biden to 114 for incumbent President Donald Trump.) Bitcoin's price has remained fairly stable over the past few hours, though at $13,900 it's still up close to 3.5% over the past 24 hours. We're going to call it a wrap for the night and get back to it tomorrow. Thanks for hanging around. For CoinDesk, this is Nikhilesh De, Bradley Keoun, Sebastian Sinclair and Sandali Handagama.      BK (23:53): Fox News calls Texas for Trump.      BK (23:44): Fox News calls Ohio for Trump.

Both markets heavily favor Trump to win the presidential race.      BK (23:21 ET): Fox News calls Arizona for Biden; that's a flip of 11 electoral votes won by Trump in 2016 and every other Republican since Bill Clinton's win in 1996.      BK (23:16 ET): Republicans flip Alabama U.S. Senate seat from Democrats.      ND (23:15 ET): Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), the former Bakkt CEO appointed to the U.S. Senate late last year, will head to a runoff, likely in January, after no candidate in Georgia's special election secured enough of the vote to declare victory. Doug Collins, a former Republican representative also running for the seat, conceded late Tuesday and will support Loeffler as she runs against Democrat Raphael Warnock.

SS (20:40 ET): Crypto predictions platform Polymarket is beginning to flash some interesting results. According to the platform, there is now a 93% chance Trump takes Florida, with predictions paying $0.93 to the Republicans and $0.70 for the Democrats.      ""Two stand outs: Pennsylvania is leaning to the Democrats while Texas is leaning heavily to Republicans with 85%,"" said Shayne Coplan, founder and CEO of Polymarket.      Other crypto predictions markets are struggling to keep pace as predictit.org and electionbettingodds.com have gone dark. Another interesting prediction is ""will Donald Trump tweet announcing that he won the election before November 5th 2020?"" Currently 55% of respondent are betting that is unlikely, though the margins are close.      ND (20:40 ET): So far, Rep. Darren Soto (D-Fla.) and Senators Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.) have won re-election, to no surprise. Soto is perhaps the most enthusiastic about blockchain of the three, introducing a number of bills aimed at integrating blockchain with government efforts. Warner is more of a Libra skeptic, while Cotton believes the U.S. should create a central bank digital currency to prevent China from displacing the dollar as the world reserve currency.      ND (20:35 ET): PredictIt is still down.      ND: Hello CoinDesk readers and welcome to our live coverage of the 2020 election results. Today Nikhilesh De, Bradley Keoun, Sandali Handagama and Sebastian Sinclair will be bringing you real-time updates as the elections are called for lawmakers important to our industry, as well as keeping you up to speed on what the prediction and futures markets are saying.      We’ll be tracking the price of bitcoin through the night to see if traders are also watching this election or if any particular outcomes have an impact on movement.      Bitcoin’s price did not react at all to the 2016 election, rising a scant 1.8% in the 24-hour trading period. Given the crypto industry’s overall lack of engagement in this election, there’s no reason to believe this might change in 2020.      Of course, it is worth noting bitcoin embarked on the famous 2017 bull run just months after the election, rising to all-time highs close to $20,000 within a year and giving birth to an initial coin offering boom that regulators are still investigating and conducting enforcement actions against nearly three years later. At the moment, bitcoin is slowly rising, hitting a nearly two-year high of $14,000 just the other day. And since the last election, its price has grown 19-fold.      Still, comparing the crypto industry now to the industry in 2016 would be foolish at best. The market has matured in many ways, with the U.S. space at least seeing the introduction of futures contracts and a greater number of regulated entities. Regulators have likewise gained a better understanding of the space, introducing new regulations or clarifying how cryptocurrencies fit into existing frameworks – to an extent.      The winners of this year’s election will get to decide how regulators are to proceed and whether new legislation is passed. CoinDesk will be here providing updates to watch it all unfold.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,"Nikhilesh De, Bradley Keoun, Sebastian Sinclair, Sandali Handagama",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/11/04/commentary-coindesk-covers-the-2020-us-election-and-crypto-impact,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
