34467875,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646886,1728430250,"Bitcoin Failed Attempt To Break $64,000 Could Lead To A Disaster – Analyst","After weeks of massive volatility, Bitcoin faces heightened risk after failing to break above a key resistance level of around $64,000. Following the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates, many investors and traders anticipated a full-blown rally throughout October. However, it appears that the expected surge may not materialize just yet. Related Reading: Dogecoin Analyst Expects A ‘Multi-Year Bullish Breakout’ – 200% Surge Potential Top crypto analyst Carl Runefelt has shared his insights on the current situation, emphasizing the significance of the $64,000 resistance. Breaking past this crucial level is critical for Bitcoin to regain bullish momentum and fuel a rally into Q4 2024. Bitcoin could struggle to sustain upward momentum without this breakout, leaving the market vulnerable to further downside. The next few days will be critical for Bitcoin’s price action as traders and analysts closely watch how the market responds. With Q4 underway, Bitcoin’s performance could set the tone for the broader crypto market. As investors brace for the market’s next move, the outcome of Bitcoin’s battle with the $64,000 level will likely determine whether the rally continues or stalls. Bitcoin Analyst Predicts Sub-$60K Dip After Bitcoin’s recent failed breakout attempt, the cryptocurrency is trading at a critical juncture at around $62,000. This level will likely determine whether BTC can reclaim momentum and push past local highs of $66,000 or drop further to $60,000 or even lower. Analysts and investors are growing increasingly uncertain as the bullish sentiment that dominated the past few weeks is beginning to fade. Now, fear and hesitation are creeping back into the market. Top crypto analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X, highlighting the precarious situation Bitcoin finds itself in. According to Runefelt, Bitcoin’s price structure has become fragile after two failed attempts to break through the key resistance level. He notes that BTC’s price dropped below important support levels after each failure, which could lead to further downsides. In his analysis, Runefelt sets a price target of $60,000, marking a 5% dip from current levels if Bitcoin cannot reclaim its previous momentum. He warns that if Bitcoin fails to hold critical support at $60,000, it could signal the beginning of a deeper correction. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Path To New Highs: Analyst Eyes $160 As Critical Breakpoint As market sentiment shifts from bullish to fearful, the next few days will determine whether Bitcoin can regain its strength or face a prolonged decline. Investors are watching closely, preparing for the market’s next move. BTC Price Action: Key Levels To Watch Bitcoin is trading at $62,421 after failing to break above the daily 200 moving average (MA) at $63,538. The price recently surged 25%, only to experience a sharp 10% dip, putting BTC at a critical juncture. Bitcoin faces serious risk in the coming weeks if it does not break past local supply levels around $66,000. The daily 200 MA has been a critical resistance level, and without reclaiming it soon, bearish momentum could take hold. If Bitcoin cannot recover and break through this level, analysts expect a deeper correction down to $57,500. This area is considered a crucial demand zone that could provide support, but a failure to hold above current levels would signal a more significant retracement.

34466231,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647059,1728426623,"Only 43 Tokens Have Outperformed Bitcoin This Year, Most Of Them Memecoins","In a year marked by significant volatility in the cryptocurrency market, memecoins have emerged as key players, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) and the rest of the largest cryptocurrencies in the ecosystem. This trend was underlined by recent insights from market expert Miles Deutscher, who highlighted a presentation by memecoin analyst Murad at the TOKEN2049 conference in Singapore. Memecoins Challenge Traditional Cryptocurrencies According to Murad, only 43 tokens have surpassed Bitcoin’s performance in 2024, with 13 of those being memecoins. Notably, eight of the top ten performers in the market this year are also memecoins. Murad emphasized that this cycle is distinct from previous ones, asserting, “The memecoin cycle is not a prediction; it has already begun—memecoins are dominating by virtually every metric.” Related Reading: TON Recovery Stalls: Another Price Decline Hinders Bullish Efforts The rise of memecoins can be attributed to several factors, particularly their ability to resonate with retail investors seeking community, identity, and excitement, rather than merely potential financial gains. As Murad puts it, “Memecoins are a superior version of altcoins.” The appeal of memecoins extends beyond speculation; it is alleged that they have cultivated a culture that fosters community and “emotional connection” among investors. Murad noted that these tokens enable users to engage in a shared experience, bringing real value through stories that “create trends and spark movements”. Success stories of significant gains—such as those seen with tokens like dogwifhat (WIF) and Pepecoin (PEPE)—propagate quickly, fueling interest and excitement in the memecoin space over the past year. According to Deutscher, the most successful cryptocurrencies have developed strong communities, often resembling “cult-like followings.” Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin have thrived on this dynamic, and memecoins are fully embracing it. SPX And GIGA Capture Retail Attention Murad further explained that the recent performance of altcoins on platforms like Binance has further fueled the memecoin narrative. Almost every altcoin listed this year is trading below its listing price, with only two exceptions: WIF, a memecoin, and JUP, which facilitates memecoin trading. Murad further alleges that retail investors prioritize making money (70%), having fun (20%), and feeling a sense of belonging (10%). Murad argues that memecoins embody this speculative nature, akin to the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) boom of 2017, but in a new form. Instead of initial coin offerings, Murad sees that memecoins are allowing early-stage investments at lower valuations, which contrasts sharply with altcoins, where most upside is captured in private markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Turns Green In October Once Again, Is The Bull Run Here? Deutscher also praised that as the memecoin phenomenon continues to grow, Murad’s insights have already influenced market dynamics, sparking one of the strongest memecoin rallies of the year. Tokens dubbed “Murad coins,” such as SPX and GIGA, have seen substantial gains, resonating with retail investors who are drawn to the excitement of potential profits. At the time of writing, the SPX is trading at $0.575, up a remarkable 35% in the 24 hour time frame, showing the impact of Murad’s participation in the TOKEN2049 in early September this year.

Bitcoin {{BTC}} continued to tread water slightly above $62,000, with each drop below that price level quickly reversing but otherwise trading aimlessly. It was down 1.2% over the past 24 hours, in-line with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index's performance. Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} was nearly flat during the same period, while layer-1 blockchain Aptos's native token {{APT}} stood out with a 6% gain.  Memecoins, perhaps the riskiest corner of the crypto space, sold off as traders took some profits off the table after the past few days' surge. Large-cap meme tokens pepe {{PEPE}}, dogwifhat {{WIF}} and popcat declined roughly 5% during the day.  That's a lackluster showing on a day when U.S. stocks rallied, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbing 1.5%. Traditional risk-off haven gold sold off 1.5%, with crude oil and silver both tumbling 4% after their run over the past few weeks. The cause behind the risk of action might be easing concerns about spiraling escalation in the Middle East after a Hezbollah leader reportedly supported efforts for a potential ceasefire with Israel.  ""It feels like there is less mental bandwidth for traditional finance players to think about crypto given the preponderance of macro narratives and tradable opportunities around Israel/Iran, China stimulus, the Fed cuts, and Trump election odds,"" Joshua Lim, co-founder of crypto trading firm Arbelos Markets, said in a Telegram message.  ""Crypto volumes and volatility have languished while the crypto-native community itself has increasingly rotated into short-lived memecoin narratives and away from majors,"" he added.  Crypto investors who overwhelmingly anticipated October to be a bullish month have been disappointed with prices down to flat for the month so far.  Zooming out to a longer timeframe, bitcoin is just consolidating below its all-time record, building a launchpad to much higher prices next year, well-followed trader Bob Loukas said.  ""An 8 month base has been built, sentiment reset, and rates are easing,"" Loukas said in an X post. ""Bitcoin closes the second year of the four-year cycle next month, entering the third and historically explosive year.""

42390215,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbtXuj,1728423253,Former Bitcoin Dev Peter Todd Denies He's Satoshi Hours Before HBO Documentary Airs,"Peter Todd, an early Bitcoin developer, denied to CoinDesk that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of the original cryptocurrency.  Todd commented hours before the debut of an HBO documentary that suggests Todd is Satoshi.  Clips from HBO's Satoshi Nakamoto documentary, which leaked hours before the firm premiered Tuesday night, seemed to finger former Bitcoin developer Peter Todd as the cryptocurrency's creator – but Todd denied it.  In an email to CoinDesk, Todd said filmmaker Cullen Hoback, best known for identifying the person behind the QAnon conspiracy theory in an earlier series for HBO, was ""grasping at straws"" if he's identifying Todd as Satoshi.  ""Yes, that interview did happen and I believe that specific shot isn't deepfaked,"" he confirmed, though he added he had not yet seen the documentary.  ""Of course, I'm not Satoshi,"" Todd said. ""It's ironic that a director who is also known for a documentary on QAnon has resorted to QAnon style coincidence-based conspiracy thinking here too.""  Even in the clips circulating on social media, Todd called the theory that he is Satoshi ""ludicrous.""  On Tuesday afternoon in New York, hours before the scheduled premiere of ""Money Electric: the Bitcoin Mystery,"" the odds on Polymarket's bet over whom the film will identify as Satoshi overwhelmingly favored ""Other/Multiple."" At the time of the Polymarket bet's creation, Todd was not listed as a possibility, so anyone who wanted to bet on him being the film's ""reveal"" would have to choose ""Other/Multiple.""  Previously, cypherpunk Len Sassaman and then computer programmer Nick Szabo held the lead on Polymarket's list of possible HBO-toshi's.  Read more: Peter Todd Wants to Fix Satoshi's Bitcoin Bugs  No firm evidence  The documentary, which lasted about 100 minutes, delved into the history of both Bitcoin and other crypto projects, but did not present any firm evidence supporting the idea that Todd was Satoshi.  There was some circumstantial evidence, including Todd's interest in cryptography from a young age, his relationship with Adam Back (who emailed with Satoshi), his technical ability and Satoshi's use of British/Canadian spellings juxtaposed with the fact that Todd is from Canada. The film's most tangible evidence hinged on a 2010 public forum post in which Todd responded to one of Satoshi's posts. Hoback argued Todd's post was a continuation of Satoshi's post, but accidentally sent from an account with Todd's name on it instead of Satoshi's.  However, the documentary did not definitively conclude that Todd was indeed Satoshi. Even the final confrontation between Hoback and Todd – the clip that was earlier leaked on social media – was speculative.  Hoback followed up by citing another blog post where Todd said he was ""probably the world's leading expert"" on how to sacrifice bitcoin, though even the filmmaker acknowledges this was a tenuous confirmation at best.  ""It was hard not to read this as an admission, like Peter wanted his inner circle to trust that he had, in fact, sacrificed the bitcoins and destroyed all access,"" he said. ""But this wasn't proof.""  Bitcoin that Satoshi mined has never moved from its wallet, leading to speculation Satoshi is either dead or purposefully prevented themselves from touching the coins.  The confrontation  In the documentary, Hoback confronts Todd, laying out his theory of how and why Todd hid his supposed involvement in the invention of Bitcoin. Todd shakes his head and laughs at Hoback's assertions.  ""I will admit you're pretty creative. You come up with some crazy theories. It's ludicrous,"" Todd said in the film. ""But I'll say, yeah, of course I'm Satoshi. And I'm Craig Wright.""  Read more: After Court Order, Craig Wright Updates Website With Admission He Is Not Bitcoin Creator Satoshi  This is clearly a joke, not a confession: Todd has previously made similar cracks that he ""is Satoshi,"" telling ""What Bitcoin Did"" podcast host Peter McCormack in a 2019 interview: ""I am Satoshi, as is everyone else.""  Todd, still laughing, warns Hoback that he's drawn an incorrect conclusion.  ""This is going to be very funny when you put this into the documentary and a bunch of bitcoiners watch it,"" Todd said. ""I suspect a lot of them will be very happy if you go this route because it's yet another example of journalists really missing the point in a way that's very funny.""  (PubKey, a bitcoin bar in New York City, showed the documentary Tuesday night. Viewers there laughed at the suggestion Todd is Satoshi. Someone said: ""They left enough plausible deniability that you [a random person] could be Satoshi."")  Hoback responds by asking what the point is.  ""The point is to make bitcoin the global currency,"" Todd responds.  Back, the CEO of Bitcoin development firm Blockstream who is standing next to Todd in the confrontation scene, did not respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk.  Though an early Bitcoin developer and someone deeply involved in the early years of Bitcoin, Todd has never been a prime suspect in journalists' years-long hunt for Satoshi. Figures like Hal Finney, Nick Szabo and Back are most frequently suggested to be Bitcoin's creator, though all have denied it.  During the McCormack podcast, Todd said that he bought his first bitcoin when the price per coin was 20 cents (which would mean he made the purchase around October 2010, two years after the bitcoin white paper was released).  Back posted on X Monday that, ""for people betting, they are betting on what the documentary concluded. Which is probably not going to be true, because no one knows who Satoshi is. So they should keep that in mind.""  Previous attempts by the media to unveil Satoshi's true identity have failed, with outlets incorrectly naming figures like programmer Dorian Nakamoto and known-pretender Craig Wright as Satoshi.

According to Cantonese Cat, SHIB is now flashing a strong buy signal based on the L3 Banker Fund Flow Trend Oscillator, a relatively lesser-known indicator. In a detailed breakdown shared via a YouTube video, Cantonese Cat explored SHIB’s recent price action in conjunction with this oscillator, revealing that it is ready for at least a 5x move to its all-time high, up until a bigger 2430% increase to a target of $0.00047. Shiba Inu Flashes Buy Signal Cantonese Cat’s latest analysis on Shiba Inu offers an interesting angle to the meme coin’s price action alongside other altcoins. The video in which he shared his analysis covers the current SHIB movement in relation to the larger altcoin market. As such, the analyst notes that Shiba Inu is one of ten cryptocurrencies among Optimism, Avalanche, Cardano, Chainlink, Boba Network, COTI, Amp, Cartesi, and Injective, which are all flashing a buy signal with the L3 Banker Fund Flow Trend Oscillator. Related Reading: Solana-Based MYRO Next In Line For $1 Billion? Why A 200% Surge To $0.2 Is Possible The L3 Banker Fund Flow Trend Oscillator is a technical indicator used to analyze the flow of capital in and out of cryptocurrencies among large market participants. A detailed analysis of SHIB’s price action with this indicator shows that this buy signal is extremely rare. The last time it flashed a buy signal for SHIB was in July 2023. At that time, SHIB was trading below $0.000008. What’s more interesting is that even though the buy signal appeared then, SHIB’s price continued to consolidate for another six months before finally experiencing a strong rally in February 2024 during the broader crypto market upturn. Fast forward to October 2024, and SHIB is now showing another sign of a bullish rally with the L3 Banker Fund Flow Trend Oscillator. SHIB Price Targets To Expect Although the buy signal is derived from the banker fund oscillator, the analyst uses Fibonacci levels to predict potential targets when the breakout eventually occurs. The first target is the 1 Fibonacci extension level, which aligns with SHIB’s current all-time high of $0.0000884. He also noted an ultimate “crazy target” for those anticipating a bigger surge. This ultimate target is at the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level, which aligns with $0.00047. Related Reading: Here’s Where We Are In The Bitcoin Bull Cycle According To The Wall Street Cheat Sheet Reaching this price would require SHIB to break through multiple resistance levels, both before and after surpassing its all-time high. Achieving this “crazy target” would represent a 2,430% increase or approximately a 30x jump from the current price level. Cantonese Cat suggests that this target could be achieved by August or September 2025, although he admits this is a highly ambitious target. According to him, a more feasible target is a 10x run from the current SHIB price. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00001733 and is down by 6% in 24 hours.

42390226,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbtYUd,1728418680,Bitcoin Protocol Babylon Pulls in $1.5B of Staking Deposits as Cap Lifted,"Bitcoin protocol Babylon completed its second staking round on Tuesday, increasing deposits to about 24,000 BTC ($1.5 billion) from about 1,000 BTC previously.  The staking round was ""duration-based,"" meaning it lasted for 10 Bitcoin blocks.  Babylon, a Bitcoin staking platform billed as a new way of providing the original blockchain's security to new protocols and decentralized applications, pulled in about $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin on Tuesday after briefly opening to additional deposits.  The uptake could show robust demand for a growing decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem atop the 15-year-old Bitcoin blockchain, previously confined to alternative networks like Ethereum and Solana.  The incoming deposits should be enough to instantly vault Babylon to the top of the industry leaderboard for Bitcoin DeFi projects, with the Lightning Network a distant second at $321 million of collateral, based on DeFi Llama data. That's still well below the overall DeFi projects, such as the Ethereum-based liquid staking platform Lido, with $23.7 billion of collateral, or EigenLayer, a retaking project on Ethereum, at $10.9 billion.  David Tse, Babylon's co-founder, who also has an appointment as an engineering professor at Stanford University, told CoinDesk in an emailed statement that the inflows were ""way beyond our expectations.""  According to Babylon staking dashboard, some 18,601 BTC had already been staked as of 20:03 UTC (4:03 p.m. ET), with an additional 5,419 BTC pending in the staking queue.  The cap was lifted for about 10 Bitcoin blocks over the course of one hour and 23 minutes, with the only restriction being that users could only stake up to 500 BTC per transaction. (Many transactions are typically included in each block.)  Because of that structure, the round of new staking deposits was described as ""duration-based,"" in a departure from the initial opening in August, where the cap was set at a fixed 1,000 BTC and filled up in an hour and 14 minutes.  Babylon's aim is to allow proof-of-stake chains to acquire capital from the deep reserves stored in BTC.  It is one of a large number of initiatives aimed at introducing utility to Bitcoin – commonplace on networks such as Ethereum but historically largely absent from the world's first blockchain.  The project turned heads in May this year when it completed a $70 million funding round, following an $18 million round the previous December.

34462304,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646918,1728417633,TON Recovery Stalls: Another Price Decline Hinders Bullish Efforts,"TON is facing renewed selling pressure as its price takes another dip, putting its recovery efforts in jeopardy. Despite previous attempts to regain bullish momentum, the cryptocurrency now struggles to hold its ground as it slips further below key support levels. With bears seemingly regaining control, the market is closely watching whether the current support levels can hold. As TON struggles to maintain its ground, the outlook becomes increasingly uncertain, with more downside risks looming. This piece aims to explore TON’s ongoing struggle to regain a bullish trajectory as a fresh price drop threatens its recovery. By delving into recent market shifts, support levels, and technical indicators, we’ll assess the likelihood of a rebound or further declines and provide insights into what could be next for TON and whether the bulls can regain control. Indicators Point To Further Weakness TON has recently entered bearish territory on the 4-hour chart, dipping just below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and approaching the crucial $4.6 support level. This drop below the 100-day SMA indicates weakening strength, and with sellers taking control, the cryptocurrency faces the potential for more losses. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the signal line has dropped to 40%, following a brief rise to the 50% threshold, suggesting that buying pressure is waning as the RSI moves deeper into bearish territory. Typically, an RSI reading below 50% implies that sellers are gaining control, which could lead to downward pressure on the price. Related Reading: Toncoin (TON) Price Action Signals 30% Crash After Losing A Key Level Additionally, TON has exhibited strong bearish momentum on the daily chart, struggling to overcome resistance at $6, as highlighted by the formation of a negative candlestick. With sellers firmly in control and the failure to break above this key level, along with continued trading below the 100-day SMA, there is potential for further downside. Without significant buying interest to counteract the selling pressure, the digital asset may face deeper declines. A closer examination of the RSI on the 1-day chart reveals that the RSI signal line is currently sitting at 40%, having dropped below the crucial 50% threshold. With the RSI trending at this level, it signals that selling pressure is increasing, potentially paving the way for more drops unless the bulls can step in to reverse the market’s trajectory. Potential Scenarios: Will TON Rebound Or Slide Deeper? TON is currently heading toward the $4.6 support level, where a potential rebound could occur if buyers manage to regain control. A successful recovery from this level may drive the price higher, with the $6 resistance level acting as the next target, potentially reigniting the asset’s recovery momentum. Related Reading: Toncoin Tumbles To $4.6 As Bears Eye Further Decline, Will Support Hold? However, failure to maintain the current support level could result in further declines, with TON possibly dropping toward the $2 price target and even lower levels beyond that.

42390212,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbtXkT,1728417361,Crypto’s Token Lockup Orthodoxy Is a Scam,"The dominant model of token distribution in the crypto space these days is the so-called “low-float, high FDV” launch. In this model, projects launch with a low fraction of the total supply in circulation, where most of the supply is locked, typically unlocking gradually after a year. This low circulation is often coupled with, and perhaps even explicitly designed to encourage, a high fully-diluted valuation. According to research by CoinGecko, today nearly a quarter of the industry’s top tokens are low float. Notable recent launches which used this model include Starknet, Aptos, Arbitrum, Optimism, Celestia, and Worldcoin (where an astonishing 95.7% of supply remains locked as of this writing).  This model is fundamentally broken. Restricting the movement of tokens distorts the market signal and misleads both actual and potential network participants who rely on that signal to make decisions. “Low-float, high FDV” results in a world where most of the upside potential of new launches is captured by private investors and little is available to the public markets at all. Ultimately, this pattern of launching tokens inflates short-term metrics at the cost of long-term sustainability and the public trust.  The fallacy of crypto vesting  What we call “vesting” in crypto has little resemblance to the actual functionality of vesting mechanisms in the traditional finance world, where vesting is used to align incentives and ensure stakeholder obligations are met. In particular, vesting in traditional corporations (e.g. RSUs) comes with specific performance expectations and the ability to revoke further ownership stake if those expectations are not met. Vesting lockups in crypto networks have no such mechanism – rather, tokens are simply locked up for a fixed period of time, and unlocked after.  These kinds of lockups – which don’t deserve the name “vesting” at all – typically distort the market signal by giving the false impression of much higher demand than there actually is. If we understand price signals as the clearing point between supply and demand for an asset, the value of those signals to the market depends on the supply and demand sides having freedom to express their preferences (e.g. sell if they want to sell, and buy if they want to buy). Lockups prevent one side of the market from expressing their preferences, and thus degrade the signal quality. This may provide some temporary benefit in market cap ranking or other metrics, but it makes the overall market quality worse because the price signals carry less information.  Worse, in practice, these lockups just screw the public. Token holders who join a project after launch are disadvantaged by gradual unlocks that present them with an inaccurate price signal which doesn’t reflect actual market sentiment. Sophisticated holders of locked tokens with access to non-public markets and information have an unfair advantage and often sell locked tokens off-market anyways. To get a sense of the true market signal, you have to analyze exactly who might want to sell but is unable to and speculate on what deals are taking place in back rooms. This analysis is too complex and time-intensive for most public market participants to do.  Market pressure inevitability  Lockups don’t prevent people from selling, they merely delay the inevitable. Vesting terms eventually expire, and those who want to sell eventually do so, putting continual downward pressure on the market and often leading to an artificial ‘slow bleed’ in market capitalization. Personally, I would be hesitant to hold an asset or participate in a network where many holders of that asset might want to exit, but are unable to. It’s also a problem for participants like validators, who require accurate price signals to sustainably predict income and operational costs.  If one goal of the crypto space is to produce meaningful products that provide real, long-term value, practices designed to artificially inflate short-term metrics will not help get us there. To accurately evaluate the potential of any particular project, you need the ability to evaluate whether people are actually committed to that project. You can’t do that if you don’t know whether people hold tokens because they truly believe in the project or because they’re prohibited from selling.  Criticism of the low-float, FDV orthodoxy has been accompanied by calls for new, ‘fair launch’ approaches to token distribution. However, many of these proposals merely call for a higher percentage of circulating supply at launch and do not call into question the legitimacy of “vesting” lockups per se.  This doesn’t go far enough. Any form of artificial manipulation of market signals is still artificial manipulation of market signals. We need to break crypto’s vesting Overton window with a variety of new experiments.  The free-market launch  This approach, which we’ve been calling the “free-market launch,” has the great advantage that it allows everyone to freely express their preferences. If you want to sell, you can sell. If you want to buy, you can buy. Best of all, you’ll be able to do so with the confidence that the price signal is meaningful, because everyone is able to express their preferences here and now, transparently and in real-time.  The long-term benefits of creating a sustainable community of stakeholders who truly believe in the project outweigh the short-term risks of providing an early exit opportunity for those who don’t. We need projects that provide real utility to the world and have real staying power, and it’s become clear that the current vesting orthodoxy is not delivering enough (or really any) of them.  The free-market approach has typically been limited to meme coins, contributing to the perception that it’s unsuitable for “serious” projects. However, it’s reasonable to argue that part of meme coins’ overwhelming success, aside from their memetic appeal, is due to the market recognizing that, over the long run, this model is more beneficial for token holders and often creates more vibrant, organic communities.  We should be trying new things, even if they are risky, and I hope that the free-market launch will open discussion on new ways forward. Groupthink – doing the same things everyone else does not because we have some specific idea of why we’re doing them, but because everyone else did them and they seemed to kind of work according to short-sighted metrics – is pernicious in crypto today. Following the herd may be a reasonable approach if you plan to launch a project and go away in a year or two, but it’s not a good strategy if you want to bring real value to the world. It’s time for new experiments.

While many are eager to uncover the individual behind this pseudonym, one expert warns that the documentary could lead to significant price manipulation in the Bitcoin market before its release. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), market analyst OxNobler cautioned that while the focus may be on Nakamoto’s identity, the real issue lies in the potential “market manipulation” allegedly orchestrated by HBO’s parent company, Warner Bros. HBO Prepares To Unveil Satoshi Nakamoto’s Identity The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto has long puzzled the cryptocurrency community, with various theories emerging over the past decade. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast: This Week’s Trends And Historical Patterns For Q4 As recently reported by Bitcoinist, one prominent candidate is Len Sassaman, a developer known for his work on remailer technology, a precursor to Bitcoin. Proponents of this theory point to several key facts, such as technical contributions, collaboration with Hal Finney, the first recipient of a BTC transaction, and a memorial to Sassaman encoded in the blockchain. While many previously believed that Hal Finney was the man behind the Nakamoto pseudonym, new evidence has surfaced, prompting an ongoing re-examination of the mystery. However, OxNobler warns that the current media push to reveal Nakamoto’s identity may have another purpose. Bitcoin Manipulation Linked To HBO’s Documentary? The expert highlights the documentary’s release date, which coincides with key financial events, including the US Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate cut on September 18, the upcoming US elections and the confirmed $16 billion payout by FTX to creditors affected by its collapse in 2022. These factors, combined with potential changes to China’s cryptocurrency regulations, suggest that the revelation of Nakamoto’s identity could have far-reaching implications beyond mere price fluctuations, according to OxNobler. The expert emphasizes the involvement of large institutional investors such as asset managers BlackRock, Vanguard and Fidelity, major players in the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) space and Warner Bros. According to OxNobler’s analysis, these entities significantly impact the market, often initiating bull runs or selling off at the peak of excitement, with the upcoming documentary event perhaps having the same results for the Bitcoin price. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Be Preparing For Next Big Rally, Analyst Explains Ultimately, OxNobler speculates that HBO may adopt one of two bullish approaches in the documentary. In a “moderate scenario,” the film could present several candidates as possible identities for Satoshi Nakamoto without definitively naming one. Alternatively, in an “all-in scenario,” the expert suggests that the HBO documentary might explicitly name the individual behind the Nakamoto alias and reveal that they passed away long ago. The expert believes this revelation would mean that no one would have access to Nakamoto’s substantial holdings, potentially removing over 5% of the total Bitcoin supply from circulation and having a bullish effect on prices. At the time of writing, BTC has managed to consolidate at $62,350 after the volatility at the end of last week saw the largest cryptocurrency on the market retreat to $59,500.

42390216,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbtXzr,1728412256,"Solana Is 'Richly Valued' Versus Ether, but Could Still Outperform If Trump Gets Elected: Standard Chartered","Solana {{SOL}} looks overvalued compared to Ethereum {{ETH}} based on several metrics, but each token's relative performance to each other and bitcoin {{BTC}} depends heavily on who will be the next president of the U.S., a Tuesday report by Standard Chartered Bank said.  Led by Geoff Kendrick, the global head of digital assets research, the bank's analysts expect more accommodating crypto regulations and higher chances of approval for spot-based solana ETFs if Donald Trump gets elected, while a Kamala Harris-led administration could weigh on smaller, riskier cryptocurrencies.  That being said, the team forecasts SOL to be the top performer of the three in a Trump administration, followed by ether and then bitcoin {{BTC}}. Under Harris expect the opposite, said StanChart, with bitcoin leading ETH and SOL bringing up the rear.  The bank's analysts, however, remain bullish on crypto no matter who wins the November election, seeing ETH rallying to $7,000 by the end of 2025 under Harris and $10,000 under Trump. The bank previously had a year-end 2025 ETH price target of $14,000.  Bitcoin could surge to $200,000 during the same period, regardless of who gets elected, the report said.  Solana overvalued versus ETH  Ethereum has been the dominant layer-1 network for blockchain applications, but Solana's increasing blockchain activity and SOL's rapid price surge convinced many crypto observers that a change in leadership is due.  While crypto valuations aren't standardized as in traditional assets, Standard Chartered analysts noted several metrics that showed SOL being overvalued compared to ETH.  SOL's ratio of market capitalization versus network fee revenues is 250, more than double than ETH's 121. Solana's supply grows around 5.5% annually, while ETH's token inflation rate stands around 0.5% a year, they added. Higher inflation means that SOL's real staking yield is 1%, compared to ETH's 2.3%. Meanwhile, 38% of all established developers in the blockchain industry work on the Ethereum ecosystem, with Solana claiming a 9% share.  ""SOL valuation metrics suggest the market is pricing in a very bright growth future for Solana, with a 100-400x increase in throughput expected,"" said Kendrick. ""Such valuations would be easier to justify under a Trump administration than a Harris one,"" he added.  In order to uphold its current valuation, Solana will need to claim dominance in multiple crypto sectors with high traffic such as finance, consumer and decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) and activate the Firedancer client that allows increased efficiency, the report said.

34459973,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646884,1728412208,Will SUI Surpass Solana? Expert Analysis Reveals Key Insights,"Layer-1 chain Sui (SUI) has been capturing significant attention lately. As of this writing, SUI has surged by 125% over the past 30 days and has skyrocketed 345% from its yearly low of $0.46 on August 5. These impressive figures position SUI among the top performers in the crypto market over the last two months and as one of the few altcoins which reached their all-time high. SUI Vs. Solana Yesterday, the buzz intensified when several accounts on X shared charts suggesting that SUI had overtaken Solana in daily transactions for the first time. Enthusiasts quickly touted SUI as the next “Layer-1 killer,” poised to surpass Solana, which has been a leading contender among Layer-1 blockchains behind Ethereum. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Path To New Highs: Analyst Eyes $160 As Critical Breakpoint However, this claim faced scrutiny from industry experts. Developer João Mendonça took to X to rebut the assertions, stating: “SUI did not surpass Solana in daily transactions — there’s no free lunch. On the left = a deceptive chart where each instruction of each transaction is counted as a transaction on SUI. On the right = Artemis’s genuine read of daily transactions.” Mendonça referenced a detailed explanation by analytics firm Artemis from May. The firm highlighted that in traditional Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) architectures, users submit transactions that execute a set of instructions. In contrast, on the SUI blockchain, users submit a transaction block containing multiple transactions that update objects in the global state. Therefore, comparing transaction counts directly between SUI and other chains like Solana can be deceptive. They explained: “Artemis decided to count Sui transaction blocks instead of transactions when comparing activity with Ethereum and other chains. This decision was based on the fact that Sui has a different architecture than the EVM, and counting transaction blocks gives a more accurate picture of user interactions.” Prominent crypto analyst VirtualBacon also weighed in on the discourse, analyzing the SUI/SOL price chart. He remarked: “SUI vs SOL ratio almost at resistance. One must question the upside potential of this ‘new killer L1’. For this to keep running another month, it either completely takes over the market share of Solana, or we rotate back to the proven chain.” Expressing skepticism about SUI’s ability to maintain its momentum against Solana’s price, he added: “Somehow people in comments believe they’re still early to $SUI at ATH and 20B FDV. It’s nowhere close to Solana level adoption imo.” Related Reading: Solana ‘In Serious Danger’ If $137 Support Breaks – Analyst Shares Targets Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe also casted doubts that the SUI price can run above the all-time high immediately. Via X, he wrote today: “SUI did run away and printed a new all-time high. The first one! Didn’t allow me to enter, but it might be topped for now. Looking at the same region or $1.85 for entry zones. Massive runner.” Despite the debates, SUI has undeniably been gaining traction. In September, Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor and RealVision, lauded SUI as a “groundbreaking ultra-fast L1, super efficient, full blockchain ecosystem”. He emphasized that SUI, developed from the remnants of Meta’s Diem project, is designed to scale for billions of users transitioning from Web2 to Web3 technologies. Pal’s endorsement amplified interest in SUI within the crypto community. Adding to its growing ecosystem, Circle—the company behind USDC, the world’s second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization—announced in September that the Sui network would support USDC. This integration is expected to enhance liquidity and utility on the Sui blockchain, potentially attracting more developers and users. Most recently, on Monday, crypto exchange Bybit announced support for SUI on its Launchpool platform. This move makes SUI only the second chain available on the service after Mantle (MNT), providing users with new opportunities to earn rewards and participate in the Sui ecosystem. At press time, SUI traded at $2.01.

34457628,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646891,1728406821,"Bitcoin Price Turns Green In October Once Again, Is The Bull Run Here?","The Bitcoin price started out the month of October on a rather bearish note with a notable 10% drop in price from $66,000 back down to $60,000. This put a damper on the “Uptober” sentiment as selling pressure mounted. However, the weekend turned out to be bullish for the Bitcoin price and the pioneer cryptocurrency has moved into the green once again. This is good news for the price not just in the short term, but in the long term as well. Has BTC Marked Its October Bottom? Crypto trade @0xjaypeg on X has taken to the social media platform to explain the movement of the Bitcoin price in the month of October. According to his analysis, the initial decline suffered by the Bitcoin price at the start of the month was not necessarily bad. This is because BTC has historically made a low in the first few days of October. Related Reading: Solana-Based MYRO Next In Line For $1 Billion? Why A 200% Surge To $0.2 Is Possible Jay explains that on average, the BTC price usually takes 3-4 days to bottom this month, especially with months of positive return. The most recent Bitcoin recovery seems to be following this trend as the price stabilized toward the 6th day of the month. Taking this into account, it could mean that the month has turned bullish for the cryptocurrency once again. If this is the case, then the Bitcoin price could be looking at an average +31.72% return this month. In the case of a positive October return, the trader outlines a possible 36.62% return. The implication of such high returns is that the Bitcoin price could be reaching a new all-time high if it does play out as expected. A 30% increase from the current price level would send the BTC price toward $80,000, or higher if the bulls maintain control. However, on the flip side of this, while the month of October has been historically bullish for the Bitcoin price, there are times when the month has ended in the red. Jay forecasts an average drawdown of -8.10%, or a -6.37% return if October moves positive. Related Reading: Optimism, Aptos, And Taiko Face $169.66 Million In Token Unlocks, Should You Buy Or Sell? What Bitcoin Price Turning Green Means The Bitcoin price turning green once again is bullish for the price, especially if the month ends in the green. More often than not, months when October have ended in the green have seen the last two months of the year follow suit, data from Coinglass shows. Over the last 13 years, five years total have ended Q4 with Bitcoin price rallies and each one began with October finishing strong. If this trend repeats here as October turns green once again, it is a good omen that November and December will likely end in the green as well.

42390219,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbtYKN,1728406116,"Crypto Investors Mostly DCA Into Their Coins, Finds Kraken","For the vast majority of crypto investors, dollar-cost averaging (DCA) appears to be a must.  That’s according to a recent survey by US crypto exchange Kraken, which found that 83% of crypto investors have used dollar-cost averaging in the past to acquire their coins, with 59% of respondents stating it was their primary investment strategy.  ""Dollar-cost averaging has survived as a strategy for the 75 years since the idea was first popularized, and I'd argue that's for good reason,” Mark Greenberg, global head of asset growth and management at Kraken, told CoinDesk.  “As participants in the survey noted, dollar-cost averaging can help remove emotion from decisions and focus on long-term outlooks,” Greenberg said. “That's especially critical in rapidly evolving technologies and markets like cryptocurrencies.""  Often called DCA for short, dollar-cost averaging is an investment strategy that entails acquiring exposure to an asset over a period of time across multiple purchases, instead of buying everything at once.  Hedging against volatility  The survey, conducted with 1,109 crypto investors and published on October 7, found that crypto investors privileged dollar-cost averaging for a variety of reasons.  Forty-six percent of respondents said the strategy helped them hedge against market volatility, while 24% of them said it encouraged consistent investment habits and 12% said it removed emotions from their decision-making process.  Perspective on the matter changes depending on one’s income: investors making less than $50,000 a year said the most significant benefit of dollar-cost averaging was the encouragement of consistent investment habits, but those making over $50,000 had more interest in reducing the impacts of market volatility.  “This difference might indicate that lower-income investors need more support with investment decisions, including maintaining regular contributions and sticking to a trading decision without emotional influence,” the report said.  “Lower-income investors most often choose riskier strategies like trying to time the market,” the report added, noting that respondents making less than $75,000 tend to prefer that strategy instead of dollar-cost averaging, whereas the vast majority of respondents making more than $150,000 privileged the more cautious route.  Higher income individuals also usually double-down on dollar-cost averaging when the market drops, whereas lower-income investors can just as likely stop trading for a while, or cut losses and sell.  Almost 74% of crypto investors keep a closer eye on markets than traditional investors usually do, the survey found. Surprisingly, that tends to be especially true of older investors — 66% of those between the ages of 45 and 60 reported checking crypto significantly more frequently than traditional markets, whereas only 33% of investors in their twenties said the same.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/08/crypto-investors-mostly-dca-into-their-coins-finds-kraken,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/08eb7e04fb7a0d7ae11f45943b9622a6fbefa156-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The staking round is ""duration-based,"" meaning it will be last for 10 Bitcoin blocks, lasting around one hour and 40 minutes, assuming an average block time of 10 minutes.  Babylon, a Bitcoin protocol which completed a staking round capped at 1,000 BTC ($62.4 million) in August, will open for business again on Tuesday with a new ""duration-based"" round.  The round, known as ""Cap-2,"" will kick off at some time around 18:30 UTC (2:30 p.m. ET).  Users will be able to stake up to 500 BTC per transaction over 10 Bitcoin blocks, commencing when the network reaches block 864,790 and closing at 864,799. That would take about one hour and 40 minutes thereafter, assuming an average block time of 10 minutes.  The first staking round in August hit its cap of 1,000 BTC within six blocks and lasted a mere hour and 14 minutes, offering a demonstration of the demand for bitcoin staking and the interest that Cap-2 could draw.  Babylon's aim is to allow proof-of-stake chains to acquire capital from the deep reserves stored in BTC.  It is one of a large number of initiatives aimed at introducing utility to Bitcoin – commonplace on networks such as Ethereum but historically largely absent from the world's first blockchain.  The project turned heads in May this year when it completed a $70 million funding round, following an $18 million round the previous December.

In this context, whale activity is peaking for big investors buying millions of tokens. As the market buzz grows, many people are asking what the future holds for this whimsical cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Analyst Foresees 90% Cardano Price Drop in Next 6 Months Whale Activity Generates Interest Popcat has recently gained attention due to major purchases made by whales. One investor made news by purchasing 2.36 million tokens for approximately $1.75 million, at an average price of $0.68. This investor had previously liquidated their shares but chose to re-enter the market with a large purchase. Another whale has gone on a purchasing binge, collecting 5.67 million tokens worth almost $3 million in just three days. These trades have resulted in a remarkable 25% increase in Popcat’s daily trading volume, which is now $151 million. As these whales stock up on POPCAT, the token has risen 20%, reaching approximately $0.067 earlier today. Popcat is now one of the top gainers among memecoins, fueling investor optimism. Positive Outlook And Market Sentiment According to CoinCodex, Popcat’s current price projection indicates a potential 220% increase, with a rise to roughly $4.26 by November 7, 2024. Technical indications point to a bullish market attitude, but the Fear & Greed Index is at 49, indicating a neutral investor stance. Popcat has performed well on 20 of the last 30 days, resulting in a strong 67% success rate. The considerable price volatility of 23%, in conjunction with the persistent upward trend, suggests that investors are in an opportunistic trading environment. The current market atmosphere and Popcat’s exceptional past performance make it a favorable time to contemplate purchasing, according to market analysts. Navigating Volatility The future of Popcat looks good, although experts advise to tread carefully as the token is very volatile. The price movements are fast, and among the very important supports set around the levels of $0.50 and $0.40-0.45; a bounce from those levels could be an indication that the bullish momentum is still intact. Related Reading: Starknet: Long Positions Liquidated Lead To 16% Losses Many believe Popcat is well-positioned for growth despite some risks, given its leadership role in the current “Cat Season,” the colloquialism for growing popularity in cat-themed cryptocurrencies. The meme coin also has exhibited a solid 6-month result with an increase of 17% in the given timeframe. This still sounds rather optimistic when talking about Popcat, given the whale activity and positive predictions. The investor needs to be watchful of market volatility here. Therefore, entry points have to be carefully assessed and a balanced approach has to be maintained. Any investment in the cryptocurrency space, especially memecoins, like Popcat, does call for tempering enthusiasm with prudence and serious research before any commitment is made.

42390209,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbtXV5,1728399495,"Binance, FalconX and the Curious Case of 1.35M Missing Solana Tokens","CORRECTION (Oct. 8, 2024, 18:42 UTC): An earlier version of this story asserted that FalconX lost track of who the 1.35 million solana tokens belonged to. FalconX said it never knew who sent the SOL, because no identifying information was tied to the transaction.  Crypto brokerage FalconX had 1.35 million solana (SOL) in its possession since 2021, but didn't know who they belonged to.  Now worth around $190 million, the tokens turned out to be Binance's, and they were recently returned to Binance.  Three years ago, 1.35 million solana {{SOL}} tokens appeared in crypto prime brokerage FalconX's wallet.  According to FalconX, there was no record attached to the transaction identifying who sent the money. At the time, SOL fetched around $20 to $30 – making this a not-insubstantial sum that mysteriously landed in the company's lap.  No one immediately emerged to claim the solana.  After FTX collapsed in late 2022, solana cratered below $10. But then it massively rebounded, and today those tokens are worth $190 million.  Recently, Binance, the largest crypto exchange and a key liquidity partner of FalconX, finally came forward as the rightful owner and asked for its SOL back. FalconX turned it over.  It's unclear exactly how this apparent mistake was made. The situation raises questions about accounting systems and controls – though even at the newly elevated SOL prices, the misplaced tokens are chump change to Binance, which has over $110 billion of assets in reserve and services over 90 million customers worldwide.  A FalconX spokesperson, when contacted by CoinDesk, confirmed that there had been ""a reconciliation anomaly"" involving solana tokens and said there was no identifying information tied to the original transaction that brought the SOL into the broker's life.  Binance, when contacted by CoinDesk, said its customers were never at risk of losing money as a result of the situation. Binance would've simply absorbed the loss itself if the 1.35 million tokens had never been found. A spokesperson said he couldn't immediately comment on whether the transaction that sent 1.35 million SOL tokens to FalconX lacked identifying info.  In a joint statement to CoinDesk, the companies said the assets in question were being returned to Binance and that the matter was now fully resolved. ""Binance and FalconX continue to operate business as usual,"" according to the statement.  Mysterious transactions and reconciliation head-scratchers happen in traditional finance, too, but crypto could be uniquely prone to a situation of this sort, where assets go unclaimed for years, inflating hugely in value in that time. Of course, crypto is a new area of finance, running on rapidly evolving infrastructure, which is home to highly volatile assets.  Speaking broadly, big auditing firms like PwC agree the relatively young crypto space is potentially susceptible to such reconciliation issues.

34454294,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24281,1728397663,"Bitfinex Alpha 125 | Bitcoin hạ nhiệt tí thôi, nhưng chưa rõ xu hướng","Tải Full Alpha Bitcoin vừa có cú lao dốc 10% trong tuần, chủ yếu do bị bán tháo trên thị trường giao ngay và làn sóng “xả hàng” các vị thế đòn bẩy. Sau khi chạm đỉnh 66.587 đô vào ngày 27/9, Bitcoin “rơi tự do”, nhất là sau khi mất mốc quan trọng 65.200 đô, kích hoạt loạt lệnh thanh lý dồn dập. Kết quả là Bitcoin hạ cánh xuống 60.000 đô la, đúng như dự đoán 5-10% giảm nhẹ của Bitfinex Alpha tuần trước , do mức độ khối lượng mở (OI) cao ngất ngưởng và thiếu vắng lực mua trên thị trường giao ngay. Thực tế, việc bán tháo trên thị trường giao ngay càng thêm nóng bởi căng thẳng địa chính trị leo thang giữa Iran và Israel, khiến nhà đầu tư tháo chạy khỏi rủi ro và dẫn đến 450 triệu đô la bị thanh lý vào ngày 1/10. Bitcoin trải qua chuỗi 4 ngày “đỏ lửa” liên tiếp đầu tiên kể từ đầu tháng 8, thị trường cũng “hạ nhiệt” khi OI giảm từ mức “nóng bỏng” trên 35 tỷ đô la xuống 31,8 tỷ đô la. Điều này cho thấy thị trường đã ổn định hơn, giảm nguy cơ biến động giá đột ngột. Bitcoin đã hồi sinh lên 62.500 đô la vào ngày 4/10 nhờ dữ liệu thị trường lao động tích cực, và thậm chí vươn lên 64.027 đô la vào đầu ngày 7/10 khi lực mua giao ngay nhỏ giọt quay trở lại. Tuy nhiên, vẫn còn quá sớm để phán về hướng đi ngắn hạn của thị trường. Một số altcoin cũng “ nhảy múa tưng bừng “, với những “ông lớn” như XRP và APT biến động 15-20%. Thị trường vẫn đang “nhạy cảm” với tin tức, nên có lẽ phải chờ xem diễn biến đầu tuần, đặc biệt là ở Mỹ, mới đoán được hướng đi tiếp theo của Bitcoin và thị trường nói chung. Dữ liệu thị trường lao động cứu cánh cho thấy tháng 9 có mức tăng trưởng việc làm mạnh nhất trong 6 tháng, với tỷ lệ thất nghiệp giảm từ 4,2% xuống 4,1%, cho thấy nền kinh tế vẫn bền bỉ. Tuy nhiên, trong khi thị trường lao động vẫn “khỏe re”, các lĩnh vực khác vẫn chưa “thấm” được chính sách tiền tệ nới lỏng. Fed được mong đợi sẽ tiếp tục hạ lãi suất vào tháng 11, nhưng lĩnh vực sản xuất vẫn “ngấm đòn” lãi suất cao và nhu cầu giảm so với năm ngoái. Dù sản xuất gặp khó khăn, lĩnh vực dịch vụ Mỹ lại “lên hương” với lượng đơn đặt hàng mới tăng mạnh trong tháng 9, đạt mức cao nhất trong 18 tháng. Điều này cho thấy nền kinh tế vẫn tăng trưởng tốt trong quý 3/2024, dù mỗi lĩnh vực lại có “nỗi khổ” riêng. Tuần qua, Quỹ Tiền tệ Quốc tế (IMF) đã “khuyên bảo” El Salvador giảm bớt “độ nghiện” Bitcoin, đề nghị điều chỉnh luật Bitcoin và tăng cường giám sát để giảm thiểu sự tham gia của khu vực công. Những cuộc thảo luận này là một phần trong nỗ lực ổn định kinh tế đất nước. Dù việc áp dụng Bitcoin trong nước còn chậm chạp, Tổng thống Bukele vẫn tin rằng Bitcoin sẽ có lợi cho tăng trưởng dài hạn của El Salvador. Metaplanet Inc. vừa bỏ túi 1,46 triệu đô la nhờ bán quyền chọn Bitcoin, củng cố thêm kho dự trữ Bitcoin của mình. Với 530,717 BTC đang nắm giữ, CEO Simon Gerovich nhấn mạnh rằng sự biến động của Bitcoin tạo cơ hội sinh lời, bổ sung cho việc nắm giữ trực tiếp. Trong một diễn biến khác, David Carmona, người sáng lập IcomTech, đã bị “bóc lịch” gần 10 năm vì điều hành mô hình Ponzi lừa đảo liên quan đến tiền điện tử. Sự sụp đổ của công ty vào năm 2019 đã khiến nhà đầu tư mất trắng. Và đó là Alpha 125. Chúc bạn một tuần giao dịch “cá kiếm” nhé!

In a blog post, the team said that the SCR token would be the first step in its roadmap to decentralization.  “SCR will be used as a primary governance mechanism of the protocol and progress to being a protocol utility token as Scroll becomes more decentralized,” the team wrote. After the governance has made progress in decentralization, the token will also be used to support decentralization of Scroll’s prover and sequencer.  The team shared that 15% of its total token supply will go towards airdrops, with this first one, happening on Oct. 22, having 7% of the share. There will be a total of 1 billion SCR tokens.  Some 17% will be allocated to investors, and 10% will go towards the Scroll Foundation. The rest will be split up for the Scroll ecosystem as well as Scroll contributors.  The token will be launched via Binance Launchpool, which will receive a 5.5% token allocation in rewards.  “We are ready for the next chapter of Scroll – to build scalable, secure infrastructure and drive towards real-world adoption with global distribution,” the Scroll team wrote in a blog post.

42390218,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbtYA7,1728397217,Satoshi’s Identity Won’t Be Revealed and That’s a Good Thing,"An upcoming HBO documentary claims it has solved the mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin. But does it really matter?  For years, journalists, bloggers, and filmmakers have tried to uncover Satoshi's identity, with the latest attempt coming from HBO’s Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery (scheduled to air 9 p.m. ET October 8). So far, none have succeeded. Yet the adoption of bitcoin around the world has continued unabated. Bitcoin was always meant to be bigger than one person. The fact that its creator had gone to great lengths to hide his or her identity was always meant to reinforce its decentralized ethos.  Bitcoin's enigmatic origin is a fundamental part of its allure and value. The idea that an anonymous developer could create a revolutionary form of money that no one controls is a narrative that resonates deeply for a generation shaped by financial crises, widespread mistrust in governments, and the desire for greater economic autonomy over the last 20 years.  Money is a major factor in the constant speculation around Satoshi Nakamoto's identity. Satoshi is estimated to have as much as 1 million bitcoin, currently valued at about $63 billion. Any sign that those coins are getting cashed out would undoubtedly spook investors, sending bitcoin’s price tumbling.  But Satoshi Nakamoto has purposely remained anonymous since the very beginning. His intent all along was to address the fact that “the root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work,” as he said in 2009. By remaining anonymous, Satoshi removed any personal bias or centralized control from the equation, ensuring bitcoin could organically grow as a community. At this point, only cryptographic proof will ever be able to prove Satoshi's identity.  Satoshi shared little about himself, but here’s what we know. We know he wrote the Bitcoin whitepaper and distributed it to the Cryptography Mailing List on October 31, 2008. We know he uploaded early source code to SourceForge. We know he registered bitcoin.org. We know he mined the first block (“Genesis Block”). We know he posted as “satoshi” on the BitcoinTalk forum. And we know that in 2011, Satoshi said in his last known communication that he had moved on to other things, handing the future of bitcoin to the world.  Researchers estimate Satoshi owns between 800,000 and 1 million bitcoin, but Satoshi’s desire for anonymity makes it difficult to know for certain. Those coins are spread across thousands of wallets, and there are only a handful of transactions and blocks that we’re certain were sent or mined by Satoshi. Sergio Lerner’s famous Patoshi Pattern is widely seen as the best theory uncovering which coins were mined by Satoshi himself.  To definitively prove his identity, Satoshi needs to sign a message with keys known to be his, or move coins on-chain that are known to belong to him. Anything less will never suffice. That won’t happen Tuesday night. This documentary won’t solve the riddle. And it shouldn’t! Satoshi’s anonymity is among the most important features of Bitcoin’s origin and a key differentiator between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  More importantly, those intent on unmasking Satoshi should consider the destructive consequences of doxing. The lives of those wrongly unveiled have been wrecked — whether it was Dorian Nakamoto, who endured a media storm, or Hal Finney’s family, who suffered the aftermath of reckless speculation.  If anyone truly respects Satoshi’s legacy, they’d protect what he valued most: Anonymity.  UPDATE 10/8/24, 14:58 UTC: This post was corrected to show that Satoshi's statement ""the root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work” was made in a P2P Foundation post, not in the whitepaper.

34453036,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646854,1728396028,"Bitcoin ETF Options Set To Supercharge Price Volatility, Expert Warns","The Bitcoin price volatility is likely to surge in both directions following the recent approval of options for spot Bitcoin ETFs, according to Jeff Park, head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Investments. In an interview with Anthony Pompliano, Park explained how these newly available options differ from existing crypto derivatives and why they could significantly impact the Bitcoin market dynamics. Why Bitcoin ETF Options Are A Game Changer Park outlined a comprehensive thesis in the interview, noting, “Volatility is not just a static measure of past performance; it reflects the distribution of potential outcomes and the severity of those outcomes.” He emphasized that the introduction of Bitcoin ETF options will bring new dimensions to how traders interact with Bitcoin, potentially amplifying both price rises and falls. This volatility, he argued, stems from the unique characteristics of options as financial instruments. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Puell Multiple Signals A Bullish Surge: Could A New ATH Be Near? While Bitcoin options are not entirely new—offshore platforms like Deribit and LedgerX already offer similar instruments—ETF options introduce a regulated market overseen by US authorities like the CFTC and SEC. This makes a profound difference, according to Park, because “removal of counterparty risk is something that crypto has not fully solved offshore.” He noted that the clearing mechanisms provided by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) bring added security to these trades, which institutional investors have long demanded. More importantly, Park highlighted the advantage of cross-collateralization, which is not available on existing platforms that cater exclusively to crypto. “Cross-collateralization allows traders to use non-correlated assets, such as gold ETFs, as collateral in Bitcoin trades,” he explained. This flexibility increases liquidity and efficiency in the market. “You can’t do this on Deribit or any purely crypto-focused platform,” Park emphasized, calling it a “huge unlock” for the Bitcoin derivatives market. Park anticipates that the introduction of these options will magnify Bitcoin’s price swings. “For any well-functioning and liquid market, you need organic buyers and sellers to create natural demand and supply,” he explained. However, the real impact comes from how dealers hedge their positions, especially when they are “short gamma,” a condition where their hedging activities can intensify price movements. In practical terms, Park said, “Dealers who are short gamma must buy more Bitcoin as prices rise and sell more as prices fall, thereby adding to the volatility.” This dynamic is crucial to understanding how ETF options could push Bitcoin’s price to extremes in both directions. He also pointed out that, historically, most Bitcoin options activity has been driven by speculation, rather than risk management strategies like covered calls, which tend to reduce volatility. Related Reading: Here’s Where We Are In The Bitcoin Bull Cycle According To The Wall Street Cheat Sheet One of Park’s key points was the dramatic growth potential for Bitcoin’s derivatives market. In traditional markets like equities, the derivatives market is often 10 times larger than the underlying spot market. In contrast, Bitcoin’s open interest in derivatives currently represents just 3% of its spot market value, according to Park’s figures. “The introduction of ETF options could lead to a 300x increase in Bitcoin’s derivatives market size,” Park predicted. This growth would bring substantial new liquidity but would likely also drive volatility higher, due to the larger volume of speculative trades and the structural leverage introduced by options. “That’s an astronomical number for which there’s going to be new flows and liquidity coming into this market which will likely therefore add volatility,” Park stated. “In the global economy, derivatives markets are far larger than the spot markets,” he added, pointing to the fact that in traditional asset classes like equities and commodities, derivatives play a critical role in risk management and speculation. “Bitcoin is moving toward a similar structure, and that’s where we’ll see the most significant price movements and liquidity,” Park concluded. At press time, BTC traded at $62,334.

42390211,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbtXfL,1728394814,"Crypto.com Sues SEC, Chair Gary Gensler After Receiving Wells Notice","Crypto.com has sued the SEC after receiving a Wells Notice from the U.S. regulator.  The notice, a warning the agency is considering bringing charges against the crypto exchange, was sent on Aug. 22.  CEO Kris Marszalek said it brought the case to limit the SEC's ""unauthorized overreach and unlawful rulemaking"" and ""protect the future of crypto in the U.S.""  Cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com said it sued the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Chair Gary Gensler and its four commissioners after the regulator sent a Wells Notice – a warning that an enforcement action might be coming – to the company.  The court filing was made ""to protect the future of crypto in the U.S.,"" CEO Kris Marszalek said in a posting on X. The suit is ""a warranted response to the SEC's regulation by enforcement regime which has hurt more than 50 million American crypto holders.""  The Wells Notice was sent to Crypto.com on Aug. 22, the filing revealed. Such notices are preliminary warnings stating charges the SEC may bring. They usually lead to enforcement actions.  The SEC has been regulating the crypto sector through a series of enforcement activities, an approach that Crypto.com and others in the industry, including Binance, Ripple and Coinbase, are fighting. In August, OpenSea received a Wells Notice alleging non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on its platform were securities. OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer said at the time the company was ""shocked"" but ready to ""stand up and fight."" In April, decentralized crypto exchange Uniswap also received one, which it urged the SEC to withdraw.  Crypto.com ""seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') from unlawfully expanding its jurisdiction to cover secondary-market sales of certain network tokens sold on the company's platform,"" the suit said. The suit was filed by Foris DAX Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware and operates under the business name of Crypto.com.  The filing said the SEC determined network tokens, except for bitcoin {{BTC}} and Ethereum's ether {{ETH}}, as securities and thus issued the notice to Crypto.com, which offers trading of other cryptocurrencies, ""for operating as an unregistered broker-dealer and securities clearing agency under the federal securities laws.""  Separately, Crypto.com filed a petition the SEC and the other primary U.S. markets regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, ""to confirm via joint interpretation that certain cryptocurrency derivative products are solely regulated by the CFTC.""     The SEC does not comment on the existence of a possible investigation, an agency spokesperson told Bloomberg. The agency did not immediately respond to a CoinDesk request for comment.  Crypto.com's filing revealed that the SEC had been investigating the company for more than two years, with a formal investigation initiated on March 28, 2023.  Crypto.com's case  Crypto.com argues that the SEC is defining ""every network token in existence"" as a security and ""arbitrarily exempting only bitcoin and ether from its scope despite substantial similarities.""  The regulator has not said which tokens traded on the company's platform it considers as securities, according to the filing. Crypto.com is seeking a ruling that none are securities and that it ""does not operate as an unregistered securities broker-dealer or securities clearing agency.""  The industry has been calling for the U.S. to create bespoke rules for the sector to provide clarify for participants. In May, the House of Representatives approved a wide-ranging crypto bill, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which has yet to be considered by the Senate.  Cronos (CRO), the native token of the Cronos blockchain that Crypto.com introduced, fell as much as 4.7% after Marszalek's posting on X and was recently trading 2.4% lower.

This means that Midas removed the $100,000 minimum investment requirement and investor accreditation process for its mTBILL and mBASIS tokens, and has also steamlined the process for investing in the tokens to make them available with as little as ""one-click."" The tokens are accessible globally excluding the U.S. and sanctioned countries, the company said.  The issuance of the products received regulatory approval from Liechtenstein's Financial Market Authority, and will be passported across Germany and Europe, co-founder Dennis Dinkelmeyer said in an email interview with CoinDesk. Passporting allows financial institutions to access all countries in the European Economic Area by acquiring regulatory approval in one of the member states.  ""We will be the only RWA issuer with a regulatory compliant offering that has no minimum thresholds and investor accreditation process and full DeFi composability of a permissionless token,"" Dinkelmeyer told CoinDesk.  Tokenized versions of real-world assets such as U.S. government bonds are increasingly in vogue among crypto investors to park their stablecoins and earn steady yield without leaving blockchains rails. The tokenized T-bill market tripled in a year to $2.3 billion with new entrants like asset management giant BlackRock entering the competition, rwa.xyz data shows. Midas's mTBILL is backed by BlackRock's short-term Treasury bill exchange-traded fund (ETF), and gathered nearly $5 million of deposits.  Along with the success of T-bill tokens, new types of yield-bearing tokenized products emerged such as Ethena's USDe ""synthetic dollar,"" which generates yield from market neutral trading positions also known as the ""basis"" trade.

42407465,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZHqqw,1728390811,Bitcoin Miners at a Crossroads: Gain Market Share or Go All-In on AI?,"Investors continue to pay a premium for miners diversifying into AI and HPC data centers, despite pure-play miners gaining market share.  Marathon, Riot and CleanSpark all saw higher production numbers in September than August.  Marathon produced more bitcoin in September than in any other month since the April halving.  Disclosure: The author of this story owns shares of the following bitcoin miners: IREN (IREN), MARA Holdings (MARA), Cipher Mining (CIFR), Bitfarms (BITF), Riot Platforms (RIOT) and CleanSpark (CLSK).  Bitcoin {{BTC}} miners are facing the strangest sort of existential threat in this era of scant profits: They can pivot to powering artificial intelligence (AI) or high-performance computing (HPC) and watch their stocks soar, or they can stick around and dominate their original turf, but see a languishing stock price.  That was the tale of mining in September, anyway, in terms of equity returns.  Miners with the largest market capitalizations – MARA Holdings (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT) and CleanSpark (CLSK) – all increased their share of the total amount of bitcoin mined last month versus August. These companies have much stronger balance sheets and larger mining operations, which is helping them navigate the reduction in mining profitability spurred by the bitcoin halving in April.  However, investors aren't paying a premium for their stocks, as they continued to underperform in September. Meanwhile, miners putting focus on AI and HPC computing, such as Core Scientific (CORZ), TerraWulf (WULF) and IREN (IREN), beat bitcoin in September.  The shift in investor sentiment isn't surprising, as the halving in April – which cut by 50% the reward for mining BTC – has made mining more competitive with narrower profit margins. Adding to the negative sentiment, the recent approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. has reduced investors' appetite for mining stocks.  Instead, investors are rewarding miners that now use part of their data centers to host AI- and HPC-related machines to diversify their revenue. AI and HPC computing require a large amount of power, which bitcoin miners have already secured, making them an attractive resource for AI and HPC companies that want to quickly ramp up their businesses.  Read more: Private Equity Giants Are Circling Bitcoin Miners on AI Allure  In fact, looking at the share prices of publicly traded miners in September, stocks of miners with larger market caps rose between 4% and 9%. Miners with links to AI and HPC saw gains as large as 25% for the month. Bitcoin's price rose about 7%, while the CoinDesk 20, a broad crypto market benchmark, climbed about 12%.  Miners are already surging in October, too, despite bitcoin trading relatively flat. Riot is up 12% and Cipher Mining (CIFR) is up 8%. October is also historically one of the strongest months for bitcoin, earning it the nickname ""Uptober.""  September's takeaway  Mining economics are tough after the halving.  The hashrate of the Bitcoin network, on a seven-day moving average, rose to an all-time high of 693 exahashes per second, or EH/s, while maintaining an average hash rate of 630 EH/s. Hashrate, a proxy for how competitive mining is, measures how much computing power is online on the network.  September also saw bitcoin difficulty – a measure of how hard it is to mine a new block in the network – hit an all-time high. Bitcoin's difficulty is a measure of how hard it is to mine a new block in the network, which adjusts every 2,016 blocks based on the computational power, ensuring the blocks are consistently mined every 10 minutes. Meanwhile, the hashprice, a measure of miners' profitability, hit a one-month high at $48.0 PH/s, according to Glassnode, despite remaining near all-time lows.  Drilling down into the individual miners' monthly data, it seems MARA – the largest publicly traded miner with a market cap of $4.8 billion, and the company formerly known as Marathon Digital – had a successful September, increasing their energized hash rate by 5% in September to 36.9 EH/s. MARA also mined 705 BTC, a 5% increase from the previous month and the most mined in a single month since the halving in April. The firm also increased its BTC holdings to 26,842, the second-largest bitcoin stockpile among publicly traded companies, trailing only MicroStrategy. At the same time, it remained on track to reach 50 EH/s by the end of 2024.  The third-largest miner by market cap, Riot Platforms, also increased its mined bitcoin by 28% during September, as the company increased computing power across its facilities. Riot estimates to hit a hashrate of 36.3 EH/s in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 56.6 EH/s by the second half of 2025. Riot currently holds 10,427 BTC in its balance sheet.  Hurricane Helene, selling BTC for land  Among other trends that stood out during September include impact from Hurricane Helene. CleanSpark, the fourth-largest miner by market cap, was among that were affected. The company said it didn't see any material losses to its infrastructures but had to shut down some operations due to the storm.  With tough capital markets for bitcoin miners, the companies started to use creative means of raising funds to grow their operations. One, Cipher Mining, stood out in September by mining 155 BTC for the month and selling 923 bitcoin to buy a 300MW mining site, which will be used for HPC hosting.

34450873,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646647,1728390659,"Dogecoin Could Be Preparing For Next Big Rally, Analyst Explains","An analyst has explained how Dogecoin could currently be gearing up for the next bull run if historical pattern is anything to go by. Dogecoin Has Recently Shown Similar Trend To Past Cycles In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about how Dogecoin has been forming a familiar pattern in its monthly price recently. Below is the chart shared by the analyst, which depicts the pattern in question. As is visible in the graph, Dogecoin had been stuck inside a long Descending Triangle between 2021 and 2024. The “Descending Triangle” here refers to a technical analysis (TA) pattern that, as its name suggests, looks like a triangle slopped downwards. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Selloff Is Calming Down: Green Sign For Rally To Continue? In this pattern, the price of the asset consolidates between two lines: a bottom level parallel to the time-axis and an upper level converging towards the bottom level. Like other TA patterns, the upper level is probable to act as resistance, while the bottom one as support. Also, a break out of either of these lines can imply a continuation of trend in that direction. From the chart, it’s visible that Dogecoin managed to find a break above its multi-year Descending Triangle this year and as the pattern foreshadowed, the surge above the upper level led to a sharp rally, in which the memecoin’s price saw an appreciation of almost 208%. Since the top of the run, though, the asset has witnessed a peak retracement of around 65% so far. This development, however, may not actually be bad, as the analyst has pointed out that the chain of events that Dogecoin has gone through in recent years is in fact similar to what happened on two other occasions in the past. In both of these instances, DOGE broke out of a multi-year Descending Triangle to observe a sharp rally, followed by a retracement of a similar scale as the one witnessed recently. The memecoin then went on to observe full-blown bull runs in both of these cases. Based on this historical pattern, Martinez notes, “after a recent 65% pullback, DOGE could be gearing up for the next big rally!” It now remains to be seen how the asset’s price develops from here and whether any similar rally would follow this time as well or not. Related Reading: XRP Crashes 14% As Whales Send Deposits To Exchanges In some other news, whales have shown rising activity on the Dogecoin network recently, as the analyst has pointed out in another X post.

Gold's relatively higher risk-adjusted returns explains its safe haven appeal.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} has surged over 40% this year, outshining major equity indices, fixed-income securities, gold and even oil, which recently rose on the back of geopolitical tensions.  However, according to data tracked by Goldman Sachs, its stellar performance in absolute terms is not sufficient to compensate for its volatility.  Bitcoin's year-to-date return to volatility ratio is under 2%, significantly lower than gold's industry-leading risk-adjusted return of around 3%. The ratio gauges the return an investment generates per unit of risk/volatility. The yellow metal has gained 28% in absolute terms.  In fact, Ethereum's native token ether, Japan's TOPIX index, and the S&P GSCI Energy Index are the only non-fixed income growth-sensitive investments with return to volatility ratios lower than bitcoin, the chart from Goldman's Oct. 7 note titled ""Oil on the boil"" shows.  That relatively low risk-adjusted performance validates crypto skeptics' long-held view that bitcoin is too volatile to become a safe haven like gold.  It also helps explain why gold rose and bitcoin tumbled alongside equity markets last week after Iran launched missiles at Israel, ratcheting up tensions in the Middle East.

42407456,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZHqdi,1728388840,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Drops as China's Stimulus Plans Disappoint,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,929.84 -0.85% Bitcoin (BTC): $62,503.74 -0.55% Ether (ETH): $2,433.31 -0.78% S&P 500: 5,695.94 -0.96% Gold: $2,646.96 +0.14% Nikkei 225: 38,937.54 -1%  Top Stories  Bitcoin pulled back after China's stimulus plans fell short of expectations. Risk assets such as BTC have been buoyed over the last week by the prospect of a massive stimulus package from the People's Bank of China stirring some life into the country's economy. However the National Development and Reform Commission's (NDRC) briefing seemed to lack urgency or specifics, denting market sentiment. Bitcoin traded at around $62,500, about 0.5% lower in the last 24 hours. The broader digital asset market fell about 0.8%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index.  Ether ETFs in the U.S. saw no money flow in or out on Monday for only the second time since their listing in July. Bitcoin ETFs, meanwhile, enjoyed their highest inflows since Sept. 27, adding a net $235.2 million. Fidelity's FBTC led the gains with $103.7 million while BlackRock's IBIT garnered $97.9 million. In contrast, the nine ether ETFs registered zero flows in either direction. The only other time this occurred was Aug. 30. The figures underline the differing fortunes of BTC and ETH products in the U.S. Bitcoin ETFs have seen inflows of nearly $18.75 billion since they listed in January, while their ether equivalents are $500 million in the red since becoming available in July.  Consensus among Polymarket bettors is divided over who will be identified as Satoshi Nakamoto on Tuesday's HBO documentary, ""Money Electric: the Bitcoin Mystery."" Odds climbed as high as 55% that the late Len Sassaman would be revealed as Bitcoin's elusive creator, but these have sunk to 7.5% following an interview with his widow in which she said he was not Satoshi. The overwhelming favorite choice on Polymarket is now ""Other/Multiple"", which carries 65% support. The leading individual candidate is Nick Szabo with 12.5%. The program will be screened at 02:00 UTC on Wednesday (9 p.m. Tuesday ET).  Chart of the Day  The chart shows privacy-focused cryptocurrency monero's (XMR) weekly candlestick price chart since mid-2021.  Prices have again turned lower from the long-held resistance at $180, extending its prolonged range play.  Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken recently said that it will delist XMR/USD and XMR/EUR pairs on Oct. 31, aligning with regulatory and compliance obligations.

34448572,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646798,1728385252,Experts Discuss What Made Solana Memecoins The Cycle’s Top Narrative,"During this cycle, Memecoins, especially Solana-based ones, became the leading narrative of the crypto market. These tokens have eclipsed investors’ attention and overshadowed the performance of many large-cap altcoins. Some experts weighed in on the market’s performance over the last year, discussing what made meme-based tokens the cycle’s top-leading narrative, and what could be next for the industry. Related Reading: FET Gears Up for Gains: Bullish Momentum Eyes $1.8 Breakout The Value Of Solana ‘Interjective Culture Coins’ Qiao Wang, co-founder of Alliance DAO, shared his thoughts on the market dynamics that led to each cycle’s top narrative. In the X post, he noted how there’s “an opportunity for retail to outperform professionals” every cycle. The alpha is for retail to get involved at a time when there’s too much career risk for professionals to get involved. Retail investors outperformed professionals during the first cycle with “simply” Bitcoin, Wang explained. In the second cycle, investors took advantage of Ethereum’s narrative, while Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) became the leading retail opportunities during the third one. Solana and the “intersubjective culture coins,” as Wang called memecoins, have dominated the ongoing cycle. The meme-based tokens’ popularity has often been criticized for a lack of utility and “substance,” frequently resulting in a “quick buck” for their creators and a few early buyers. Nonetheless, Wang seemingly suggests that these tokens’ value relies on the shared culture behind them, an argument that experts and industry figures have discussed before. As reported by NewsBTC, crypto traders Ansem and Kel debated the value of memecoins in the Unchained podcast. In the interview, the traders explained there’s value in memes and culture on the internet, which makes a comparison with other altcoins “pointless.” They added that the crypto community is “very internet-centered” as its members understand the financial aspect and are very knowledgeable about online culture. As such, crypto investors realized there’s an opportunity to “financialize” meme virality in the industry. Additionally, they pointed out that the “shared experience of relating” is another crucial factor driving the craze of meme-based tokens, as seen with the communities of Solana-based memecoins like dogwifhat (WIF) and Popcat (POPCAT). Memecoins ‘Absorbed’ The Market’s Energy On Sunday, Chris Burniske, the co-founder of Placeholder, also took X to weigh in on the memecoins frenzy. To him, “Memecoins’ tendency to trigger is all you need to observe to know they’ll be bigger than we expect in the expansion ahead.” In the post, Burniske revealed that he considers the “trend is clear” as the cultural relevance NFT collections had in 2021 will be surpassed by some of the memecoin sensations of this cycle. It is worth noting that, on October 7, the total market capitalization of Solana memecoins surpassed $10 billion, as SolanaFloor reported. Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko replied to Burniske, sharing his theory for why memecoins became the leading narrative. Yakovenko considers that the previous cycles “were also 90% memes and 10% products.” Related Reading: XRP Takes A 16% Hit In SEC Lawsuit Drama, But Analysts See Hope However, he suggests that today, the sector has monopolized the energy that propelled different narratives during other cycles: “My theory is that memecoins today have completely absorbed the meme energy that drove other cycles, like DeFi summer,” Solana’s co-founder noted. Based on it, Yakovenko believes that products must “make it purely on value” now, which could be a positive thing for the broader industry. As of this writing, Solana (SOL) is trading at $151, a 4% surge in the last 24 hours.

34447476,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24271,1728381600,Bitfinex to List NYM Token,"ROAD TOWN, Tortola, British Virgin Islands – 8th, October 2024 – Bitfinex ( https://www.bitfinex.com ), a leading digital asset trading platform, announces the listing of NYM (mainnet), the native token of Nym technologies . Nym claims to be a ‘Noise Generating Mixnet’ (NGM) infrastructure that secures the privacy and integrity of all online traffic, protecting against traffic pattern analysis and metadata surveillance. The NGM is designed to integrate with any app or chain. The Swiss-based company behind the NGM is launching NymVPN , a full-stack consumer facing app to access the network later this year. The NYM token plays a vital role in the Nym mixnet and Appchain. It grants users access to the network, enables the payment of transaction fees, and supports the system’s privacy infrastructure. The use of the mixnet , NYM claims, is that it can route network traffic in a way that makes it untraceable, even for global internet monitoring systems. The NYM token is available on two blockchain standards: ERC-20 as well as the native NYM on the Cosmos chain, which allows users to delegate tokens and engage with the Nym ecosystem. Bitfinex will list the NYM mainnet token on Cosmos, and will also provide a facility for any customer who wishes to deposit the ERC-20 token, allowing individuals to convert it to the mainnet token to trade, using the Bitfinex currency conversion tool. “We’re pleased to offer NYM to our customers and to support Nym Technologies in their efforts to enhance privacy and security in the digital space,” said Henry Child, Head of Tokens at Bitfinex. “NYM’s listing on Bitfinex will allow users to participate in a growing network designed to protect data privacy on a global scale.” NYM deposits will be opened at approximately 12:00 PM UTC on 8 October, 2024, subject to network conditions. Trading is planned to commence at approximately 10:00 AM on 10 October, 2024, contingent upon liquidity requirements being met. NYM will be tradable against US Dollars (NYM/USD) and Tether tokens (NYM/USDt).

MSTY has generally performed in line with MSTR shares, though shareholder upside is capped due to the call strategy of the fund. The distribution rate is enormous at 84.2%. Though, income investors seeking stable returns over time should likely steer clear of this Bitcoin-adjacent derivative play. In a recent article for Seeking Alpha, I covered the YieldMax Universe Fund of Option Income ETFs ( YMAX ). One of the reasons why I wanted to weigh in on that fund was because of its place in the Top 25 new ETFs of 2024 so far by flow. This is the table below showing the rest of that list: ETF Popularity (Nate Geraci via X) The fact that so many of the top funds by YTD flow are crypto-themed products should not be lost on investors. Interestingly, YMAX is not the most successful fund that YieldMax has brought to market this year; that honor goes to the Yieldmax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ). In this article, we'll get into the fund details for MSTY, the performance for the shares so far, and assess whether or not the shares are suitable for income investors. Fund Details Similar to the overwhelming majority of funds offered by YieldMax, MSTY is a single-stock option income fund. As astute readers have probably already deduced, MSTY generates income exclusively from selling options in MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) shares. I've covered MicroStrategy for Seeking Alpha in the past. For those interested in my views on the company itself, I liked MSTR quite a bit in December , and I was a bit less inclined to buy them more recently in July . But my fundamental view of MSTR matters less than the objective and performance of MSTY. Fund Info MSTY Gross Expense Ratio 0.99% AUM $592m Distribution Rate 84.2% Inception 2/21/24 Source: YieldMax, as of 10/4/24 The objective of the fund is to generate income for shareholders. As an actively managed fund, capital is never directly invested in MSTR shares. Rather, income is generated from writing calls. Thus, the 1% annual fee is higher than what a more passive ETF might cost shareholders. The options strategy utilizes call writing, which caps potential gains if shares of MSTR rally significantly. It's a fairly straightforward fund, in my opinion. The question is: Does the strategy work? Performance In my view, finding the right benchmark from which to judge MSTY is a bit tricky. On one hand, it's advertised as an income product and should theoretically be compared to other income ETFs. On the other hand, MSTY is essentially a derivative of MSTR, which itself is a derivative of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), and should probably be judged more similarly to crypto-themed investment products. Personally, I'm choosing the latter: Data by YCharts In the chart above, we're looking at MSTY against MSTR, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF ( FBTC ), and the Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITX ) since the inception of MSTY. At a 114% total return, anyone who has held MSTY since the day the product launched has done quite well. While the fund is behind MSTR shares, MSTY is beating both FBTC and BITX from a total return standpoint. Now, it's important to keep in mind that a significant portion of that total return has come from distributions: Data by YCharts For instance, if a MSTY shareholder purchased the fund on Day 1 at $20.60 per share, that shareholder has a little over $6 in paper gains and $15.80 in distributions through September payout. This buyer is just a few months from house money territory, assuming payouts remain in the $1.50 to $2 range. But what if, rather than buying the late-February launch, the MSTY shareholder instead bought in March at the share price highs for MSTR and MSTY? Data by YCharts This is where things get interesting because MSTY has provided a total return of just 5.7% since March 28th. Admittedly, MSTY has performed better than MSTR, FBTC, and BITX over that period of time. What if we change our barometer to the August 5th lows in MSTR? Data by YCharts Again, we see MSTY holding up very well relative to FBTC and BITX, but slightly behind MSTR when buying from short-term price lows in MSTR. Of course, there is another possible scenario that prospective MSTY shareholders should be mindful of, and that's allocating a position just as MSTR starts going down. Consider the total return from the late-March highs to the May lows: Data by YCharts Here we see MSTY holds up better than MSTR, but even with the fund's distributions in April, MSTY shareholders still see a 30% negative total return in a matter of just a few weeks. I suspect such a large draw-down is a non-starter for most income investors. Thus, timing the entry and exit of the MSTY fund is just as important as timing long positions in MSTR. Risks So far, I think it is fair to say MSTY generally performs with MSTR in both directions, but with less upside when MSTR is in a price move higher and slightly less pain to the downside when MSTR is moving lower. From where I sit, MSTY behaves far more like a risky crypto-themed equity than an income product. The fund has only been available in the market for a few months. Because of that, I'm hesitant to call the product a 'sell' outright, due to the possibility that it could theoretically outperform MSTR over time. I'm not sure that's the most likely outcome, personally, but I'll concede that it's possible. I suspect the fund will under-perform MSTR over the long haul due to the capped upside from the fund's call writing strategy. Final Takeaways MSTY is an odd product. I don't personally think it's suitable for income investors seeking stable returns. Similar products from YieldMax that cover other stocks have shown that the long-term trend in distributions is downward. Despite the popularity of the fund as one of the top new ETFs in 2024, I suspect the best returns have already been made for those who bought fund shares shortly after it launched. To be fair, MSTY is likely a safer product than leveraged ETFs like BITX, in my view. But I keep coming back to shareholder objectives and expectations. Longer term, I think income investors will be able to sleep much better at night through exposure to more predictable returns. For me, there isn't much of a reason to buy a synthetic long option strategy fund that under-performs the stock to the upside and still declines when the underlying goes down. Thus, I view MSTY as a risky derivative masquerading as an income ETF.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4725555-msty-risk-masquerading-as-income?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/34446738.jpeg

It also warned scammers are diversifying into new tactics and making use of new technologies such as AI.  The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime called on Southeast Asian nations to make operating a money service business or virtual asset service provider (VASP) without a license a criminal offense.  Some VASPs – including those with links to known criminals – are facilitating transactions for fraud outfits and high-risk gambling sites, the agency said in a report published Monday.  One unidentified entity engaged in “at least hundreds of millions of dollars” in transactions with criminal operations, according to the report. Among them were groups connected to or directly involved in large-scale drug trafficking, human trafficking, cybercrime and child sexual abuse material, as well as entities sanctioned by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and wallets linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group.  “It is more critical than ever for governments to recognize the severity, scale and reach of this truly global threat, and to prioritize solutions that address the rapidly evolving criminal ecosystem in the region,” Masood Karimipour, UNODC's regional representative, said in a statement.  The agency also recommended greater monitoring of organized crime involvement in casinos, junkets, cyber fraud operations and other businesses linked to scam operations, as well as better training for authorities in online gambling operations and money laundering methods enabled by sophisticated technologies, particularly cryptocurrencies.  While not all the scams run out of the region involve crypto, it is a popular payment choice with scammers “due to the ease with which rapid cross border transactions can take place, widespread misinformation and low levels of understanding about how cryptocurrency functions, and, in some cases, the breakdown of cross-border law enforcement cooperation, investigation, case intake, and asset recovery,” the report said.  Run out of unassuming office blocks or casino complexes, online fraud has mushroomed into a huge industry in the region, though scammers and victims are usually from elsewhere. A previous UN report estimated that around 220,000 people work in scam centers in Cambodia and Myanmar alone, some against their will after having been lured to the countries under the pretense of a legitimate job.  Among the scams is pig butchering, a type of romance scam where the operators befriend unsuspecting victims online before coaxing them to invest in fraudulent platforms.  The report found that scammers are diversifying, adding approaches including impersonation scams, job or task scams, asset-recovery scams and targeted approval phishing scams. It also found an increase in the use of new technology such as AI and deep fakes to help run their operations.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Callan Quinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/08/un-agency-recommends-criminalization-of-unlicensed-vasps-in-southeast-asia-to-counter-cyber-fraud,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dc366513b737f1a0ffc0b20f21c85addfafbc2bb-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34446271,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646805,1728379852,Bitcoin Price Forecast: This Week’s Trends And Historical Patterns For Q4,"Last week, Bitcoin (BTC) experienced considerable volatility, climbing to a two-month high of $66,500 before falling back to a low of $59,500 at the end of the week. However, the leading cryptocurrency has resumed its upward trajectory, hitting $64,500 on Monday. Higher Highs And Bullish Trends Crypto analyst Doctor Profit recently released a report commenting on the recent price movements, noting that Bitcoin has successfully printed a new higher high for the first time since reaching its all-time high (ATH). According to the analyst, this development challenges the bearish narrative that had suggested Bitcoin would continue to decline, based on a theory of higher highs and lower lows. “Their own theory has given them a slap right in the face,” he remarked, suggesting that the recent price action should serve as a wake-up call for some skeptics. Related Reading: FET Gears Up for Gains: Bullish Momentum Eyes $1.8 Breakout Doctor Profit also noted that the higher high/lower low pattern tends to break down during strong sideways movement, particularly when key moving averages are involved. The analyst highlighted Bitcoin’s recent retest of the 50-day moving average (MA50), placed at the $60,000 level met with strong bullish momentum, reinforcing his view that Bitcoin remains bullish. Doctor Profit plans to establish new long positions around the $60,400 level, should the market revisit that area. In terms of short-term targets, Doctor Profit sees $66,000 as a clear objective, expressing confidence in the potential for Bitcoin to reach this level soon. He also noted the significance of upcoming economic data, with crucial Producer Price Index (PPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation reports scheduled for release this Thursday and Friday. Bitcoin Consolidation Phase Nearing End? Adding to the optimistic outlook for the BTC market, another analyst, TedPillows, recently indicated that Bitcoin’s current consolidation phase may be nearing its end after nearly six months of trading below the $70,000 level. He compared previous market cycles and noted that BTC consolidated for 161 days after the 2016 halving and 175 days after the 2020 halving. Related Reading: Solana-Based MYRO Next In Line For $1 Billion? Why A 200% Surge To $0.2 Is Possible With the current consolidation phase ongoing for 168 days, Pillows suggests that Bitcoin is either on the verge of exiting this phase or is already at its conclusion. This analysis hints at the possibility of Bitcoin achieving a new all-time high above the previous record of $73,700 reached in March of this year. When writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is trading at $63,835, up 2% in the last 24 hours and maintaining its 17% gain for the month.

The consensus amongst Polymarket bettors is that it's someone not on the list.  The odds of the late Len Sassaman being revealed as the elusive pseudonymous founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, in an HBO documentary slumped to 14% after his wife, Meredith L. Patterson, said he was not and that the company had not approached her when making the documentary.  A Polymarket contract asking bettors who the documentary would name saw the odds on Sassaman, who died in 2011, as high as 55% over the weekend. They dropped sharply after DLNews published an interview with Patterson. The program will be screened at 02:00 UTC on Wednesday (9 p.m. Tuesday ET).  “I kind of wonder whether I’m screwing with the prediction markets by answering honestly when people ask me questions, but long story short, f*ck em,” Patterson told DL News.  <  The early speculation on Sassaman led to a number of memecoins named after him, and some even after his cat, trending on social media and within crypto circles focused on various blockchains. Some people contacted Patterson for confirmation and received an address on the Solana blockchain for token donations in return.  Patterson was not the only contender. Bitcoin proponent and businessman Samsow Mow said Blockstream CEO and early Bitcoin developer Adam Back would be unveiled as Nakamoto. Another, smart-contracts pioneer Nick Szabo, briefly led odds on Polymarket in the late U.S. hours Monday, before Sassaman retook the flag.  Back refuted Mow's assertion, calling it a joke and tweeting a denial, saying he doesn’t know who Satoshi is. Mow is expected to appear in the documentary.  Despite no conclusive leak of the reveal, the deluge of rumors and speculaton was enough to move millions of dollars among various candidates on Polymarket in the past 24 hours.  As of Tuesday afternoon Hong Kong time, “Other/Multiple” has over 56%, with Sassaman taking 13%, ahead of Back who has just over 11%, with over $13 million bet on the question.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | SOL,"Sam Reynolds, Shaurya Malwa",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/08/polymarket-bettors-shuffle-odds-of-bitcoins-creator-reveal-ahead-of-hbo-documentary,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/398f2923eb10acc175310d33458f72634c249d24-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a CryptoQuant analyst, who goes by the pseudonym ‘IT Tech,’ BTC’s recent price fluctuations have led to short-term holders (STHs), labeled as “weak hands,” exiting the market, potentially passing their holdings to long-term investors or “strong hands.” Related Reading: Is The Worst Over For Bitcoin? Analyst Suggests Local Bottom May Be Here Short-Term Holders Exit Equals Market Opportunities The analyst’s post, “Weak Hands & Bitcoin Dips: Uncovering Short-Term Holders’ Behaviour During Price Drops,” outlined how Bitcoin’s price movements are closely tied to STH behavior. The analyst explained that when Bitcoin faces a dip, these short-term holders typically panic and sell off their assets, often at a loss. This pattern is represented by increased purple bars in the chart shared by the analyst, signalling a heightened sell-off during market downturns. As STHs exit their positions, these sell-offs often transfer Bitcoin to stronger hands—long-term holders more likely to accumulate and hold through market volatility. The CryptoQuant analyst reveals that as these STHs continue to sell their holdings in reaction to market dips, their overall supply is reducing, resulting in reduced selling pressure, potentially stabilizing Bitcoin’s market price. IT Tech emphasized that understanding the behavior of these short-term holders can be pivotal in identifying “market bottoms.” The theory is that as STHs exit the market during downturns, it signal the possibility of accumulation opportunities. In simpler terms, the analyst explained that as Bitcoin moves to holders less likely to sell at short-term price drops, the market is more likely to find a “price floor,” possibly setting the stage for future bullish momentum.

42407457,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZHqDG,1728369925,"U.S. Election 2024: Bitcoin and S&P 500 Options Diverge, Hinting at Major Market Moves","Short-term BTC options show a bias for calls, indicating positive outlook around the U.S. election, due Nov. 4.  The S&P 500 options suggest otherwise, according to data tracked by Block Scholes, and some crypto traders have been selling volatility.  The idea that bitcoin {{BTC}} typically moves in lockstep with the S&P 500 is generally accepted by now. The positive correlation, however, may be tested in the lead-up to the U.S. elections as options market pricing points to diverging trends.  On Monday, bitcoin options listed on dominant crypto exchange Deribit exhibited a noticeable skew (bias) for short-term calls relative to puts, capturing the U.S. election and its result, due Nov. 8, according to data tracked by analytics platform Block Scholes.  Meanwhile, short-term options tied to Wall Street's benchmark equity index, the S&P 500, showed a bias for put options.  The relatively stronger demand for bitcoin calls is a sign of traders anticipating upside volatility or higher price movements around election time. A call option gives the buyer an asymmetric upside, allowing the entity to hedge against or profit from a price rally.  The bias for the S&P 500 puts suggests fears of downside volatility because a put option offers protection from price losses. Note that it's common for the index options skew to show a bias for puts due to several reasons, including tail risk hedging by portfolio managers.  Still, the divergence between bitcoin and S&P 500 options is ""setting the stage for something big,"" according to Block Scholes CEO and founder Eamonn Gashier.  ""Either the strong positive correlation between BTC and the S&P 500 is about to break and flip negative, or one of these markets is mispriced. The excitement lies in the uncertainty -- are we on the brink of seeing Bitcoin decouple from equities, or are traders in one market about to get caught off-guard?,"" Gashier told CoinDesk.  Some crypto traders ""sell volatility""  It may seem counterintuitive to bet on a dull price action or volatility drop ahead of a binary event like the U.S. election, but some traders have been doing just that.  The implied volatility (IV) for the Nov. 8 election expiry options trading on Deribit has declined from an annualized 62% to 55%, according to data tracked by crypto liquidity provider Wintermute. That's a sign of traders setting up volatility-bearish strategies. The IV is influenced by the demand for options.  ""Traders have sold volatility here via strangles and straddles and volatility spreads. Most of this positioning is around the $65,000 strike,"" Jake Ostrovskis, OTC Trader at Wintermute, told CoinDesk.  ""All of these trades benefit from reduced volatility – thus betting realized trades under implied as these events have done in recent history,"" Ostrovskis added.  Selling straddles and strangles means selling both call and put options in a bet that the underlying asset's price will remain largely rangebound. The seller collects the premium, which is retained if the price stays in a narrow range till expiry. However, it's a risky strategy that is better suited to savvy traders with ample capital supply because if the volatility spikes, losses can quickly mount, far exceeding the premium received.  According to FT, the tight presidential race has the S&P 500 and the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, traders betting on a volatility boom through the VIX call options.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/08/us-election-2024-bitcoin-and-sp-500-options-show-divergent-trends,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac2fe10f3475415836ac30def7147147eb284495-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Right In The Balance Right Now The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment among the traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. This index determines the sentiment by accounting for the data of the following five factors: trading volume, volatility, market cap dominance, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. To represent the calculated sentiment, the indicator uses a scale that runs from zero to hundred. When the metric’s value is greater than 53, it means the investors are sharing a sentiment of greed right now. On the other hand, the indicator being under 47 suggests the dominance of fear in the sector. Naturally, the region in-between these cutoffs corresponds to a neutral mentality. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Scoop Up 1 Billion DOGE: Time For Rally To Return? Now, here is how the latest value of the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has been like: As is visible above, the indicator has a value of 50, which implies that the market sentiment is exactly in the balance at the moment. It’s also not just today that the metric has been in this zone, as it had in fact signaled a neutral market during the weekend as well. The below chart shows how the index’s value has changed over the past month. From the graph, it’s apparent that the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index had slipped into the fear region during the starting few days of this month, a result of the bearish action that the market as a whole had witnessed. The traders hadn’t become too fearful in this drop, though, as the indicator had only reached a low of 37. With the price recovery that has followed since then, the sentiment has improved to the current 50 level. Interestingly, however, despite the month of October being popularly dubbed ‘Uptober,’ a result of BTC historically performing well in this period, the market is yet to embrace greed. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Selloff Is Calming Down: Green Sign For Rally To Continue? The fact that the investors are still neutral despite a bullish wave seemingly starting with the recovery would suggest the investors are currently hesitant about getting excited over the prospect of a run. Historically, Bitcoin has tended to move opposite to the expectations of the majority, so a highly bullish sentiment has usually been a bad sign for things to come. In this view, the fact that the investors are currently not displaying hype could actually turn out to be a boon for the coin’s rally. BTC Price Bitcoin had broken beyond the $64,000 level earlier in the day, but the asset appears to have seen a pullback since then as it’s back at $63,600.

42407453,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZHqTn,1728367077,Bullish Bitcoin Hopes Dented as China Eases Stimulus Plans,"BTC is down 1.5% as the market was underwhelmed by stimulus measures announced by Beijing.  Crypto traders are looking to an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting for clues on where BTC might move next.  A September rally in Chinese stocks fizzled Tuesday as traders returned to the market following a weeklong holiday, with bitcoin {{BTC}} sliding in early Asian hours as broader market investors reacted.  Bitcoin dropped as low as $62,000 in late U.S. hours Monday before rising to $62,700 in early Asian hours to pare nearly all gains over a seven-day period. Major tokens Solana's SOL {{SOL}}, ether {{ETH}}, XRP {{XRP}} and BNB {{BNB}} fell up to 4%, paring Monday's gains.  The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid fund tracking the largest tokens by market capitalization, lost 2.18%.  Investors widely expected the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) to outline more stimulus measures in a Tuesday briefing after the Chinese Golden Week holiday, adding to the government’s September plans of rate cuts and liquidity support for the market to rile up a slowing economy.  There were expectations of a big rally when Chinese markets re-opened on Tuesday, part of which could spill over to crypto markets.  However, the briefing’s general lack of urgency and specifics, and no plans for further stimulus underwhelmed investors - denting market sentiment as concerns around conflicts in the Middle East remain. At the same time, many felt an urge to take profit from the rally.  China’s premier index, the Shanghai Composite, jumped 4% after opening but fell through the day as investors digested new comments. Hong Kong’s tech-heavy Hang Seng fell nearly 7%, reversing gains from Monday and Friday.  Some analysts previously warned of a late September rally having legs to keep the momentum going, as the latest stimulus appeared sanguine compared to the 2015 cycle, which buoyed asset prices for a longer period.  As such, NDRC Chairman Zheng Shanjie described China’s economy as “stable” and showing “progress,” saying fundamentals are unchanged and there’s confidence in meeting its economic growth target of around 5%, per Bloomberg.  Meanwhile, crypto traders continue to look to Federal Reserve meetings scheduled for later this week for clues on further positioning.

42407454,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZHqX6,1728364785,Hong Kong Gearing Up to Approve More Cryptocurrency Exchange Licenses by Year-End: SFC,"SFC CEO Julia Leung said 11 applicants had undergone an on-site review.  HKVAX received regulatory approval last week, the third exchange in Hong Kong to do so.  The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) plans to approve more cryptocurrency exchanges to operate in Hong Kong by the end of the year, according to its CEO Julia Leung.  Speaking on Oct. 6 with local outlet HK01, Leung said that 11 of the platforms that have applied for a license have now undergone on-site reviews. She expects further progress in their applications by the end of the year.  Her comments came following the approval of local exchange HKVAX’s application last week. The company, which aims to launch its platform in Q4 this year, is the third exchange in the city to receive regulatory approval.  HashKey and OSL also have operating licenses, which were upgraded from licenses they already held under the previous regulatory regime.  Bullish, the parent company of CoinDesk, has also applied for a license.  The SFC did not respond to a request for clarification about how many platforms have applied. One page on its website lists 11 applicants for the licensing regime, while another lists 16.  The promise of future approvals comes after criticism that Hong Kong’s current regime is too strict, potentially damaging the city’s goal of becoming a crypto and web3 hub.  In August, a report suggested the regulator had found “unsatisfactory practices” at some exchanges. In particular, it stated that ""some of the crypto firms are overly reliant on a handful of executives to oversee the custody of client assets, while others aren’t properly guarding against cybercrime risks.""  After failing to secure applications from big names like Coinbase – despite the exchange being personally invited to set up in Hong Kong by Legislative Council member Johnny Ng – other international companies have withdrawn their applications. (One exception is Crypto.com, which remains on the applicant list.)  Among those who withdrew are OKX and Bybit, both of which canceled their applications in May and did not disclose the reasons for doing so. The South China Morning Post reported that one major factor may have been an SFC notice that they must prevent mainland Chinese residents from accessing their services.  In an opinion piece in the Hong Kong Economic Journal shortly after OKX withdrew its application, lawmaker Duncan Chiu warned that the approval conditions borrowed concepts from traditional finance that he believed were too strict to apply to web3. He added that the remaining applicants were “small in scale.”  At the same time, lawmakers have argued that the SFC also bears the brunt of criticism when scam exchanges exploit Hongkongers. It came under fire last year for the collapse of JPEX, a rogue exchange that has left over 2,600 Hongkongers some $200 million out of pocket. Over 70 people have been arrested as part of a police investigation into the exchange but to date nobody has been charged.  JPEX’s shutdown led to changes in how the SFC shares information about exchanges with the public. Among these changes, it started publishing lists of which companies had applied for licenses – something they had previously declined to reveal – and listing suspicious platforms on its website.  Along with JPEX, several chains of OTC crypto trading storefronts linked to it were raided and shut down by the police, prompting calls to regulate OTC trading. Leung said the SFC has also been seeking industry opinion on licensing for cryptocurrency OTC and custody services.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Callan Quinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/08/hong-kong-gearing-up-to-approve-more-cryptocurrency-exchange-licenses-by-year-end-sfc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b30be3a161c429ee2e82f4fc273cf7a493c77858-4816x2709.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34439454,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646752,1728363628,Ethereum Proposal EIP-7781 Promises Network Performance Boost – Here’s What To Expect,"Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 7781 aims to reduce Ethereum network slot times, expand blob capacity, enhance decentralized exchange (DEX) performance, and lower gas fees. What Is Ethereum Improvement Proposal – 7781? EIP-7781 has garnered attention from the Ethereum (ETH) community due to its potential impact on the smart contract platform. Proposed by Ben Adams, co-founder of Illyriad Games, the new EIP promises several benefits, including reducing network slot times from 12 seconds to eight seconds, resulting in a 33% increase in transaction throughput without a corresponding rise in data blob counts. Related Reading: Vitalik Buterin Proposes A Privacy Fix for Ethereum For the uninitiated, data blob counts in Ethereum refer to the number of chunks of data included in a block for future use by rollups or layer-2 scaling solutions. These blobs help offload data storage and processing from the base Ethereum network, reducing congestion and improving scalability. EIP-7781 also aims to distribute network bandwidth more evenly, effectively lowering peak bandwidth requirements without sacrificing network efficiency. In his proposal, Adams explains: This would be equivalent to increasing blob count from 6 to 8 or gas limit from 30M to 40M; however this approach does not increase peak bandwidth. Commenting on the proposal, Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake said he supports reducing slot times to eight seconds. Drake added that the proposal would help DEXes like Uniswap v3 become 1.22 times more efficient, saving approximately $100 million in CEX-DEX arbitrage annually, resulting in better user trade execution. Similarly, Pseudonymous developer Cygaar shared their thoughts on EIP-7781, saying, if approved, the proposal can increase Ethereum’s throughput by as much as 50%. The developer also confirmed that the proposal would help lower Ethereum gas fees. However, Cygaar cautioned that reducing slot times should not come at the expense of significantly increasing hardware requirements for solo validators. To clarify this concern, shorter block times could cause the Ethereum blockchain’s data to grow more rapidly, requiring stronger hardware and faster internet to keep up with the quicker updates. This could present challenges for solo stakers and node operators. EIP-7781 Raises Concern For Solo Stakers While EIP-7781 promises to address several of the current challenges on the Ethereum network, there are concerns about its impact on solo stakers. Related Reading: Ethereum Inflation Surge Casts Doubt On “Ultrasound Money” Claim: Report For instance, Cinnehaim Ventures partner Adam Cochran noted that the proposal “seems reasonable in terms of bandwidth on solo stakers” as long as the gas limit per block remains unchanged. Cochran added: Would want to see some tests on I/O hardware and staker return ping times to make sure it doesn’t cut off some home stakers but, it seems like it should be within range for most. It should be recalled that recently, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin advocated lowering the ETH requirement for solo stakers from 32 ETH to 16 or 24 ETH. Buterin stressed the importance of solo stakers in securing the Ethereum network, suggesting that an increased proportion of solo stakers could provide an extra layer of protection against network attacks. At press time, ETH trades at $2,469, up 1.7% in the last 24 hours.

The price must clear the $0.5450 and $0.5500 resistance levels to start a decent increase. XRP price is still consolidating above the $0.5080 support. The price is now trading near $0.5250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $0.5380 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.5450 and $0.5500 resistance levels. XRP Price Eyes Upside Break XRP price remained well-bid above the $0.5080 support level, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price started a slow upward move above the $0.5220 and $0.5320 resistance levels. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $0.5380 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. However, the bears were active near the $0.5450 resistance level. They protected the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.6640 swing high to the $0.5070 low. The price is now trading near $0.5250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is another increase, the price might face resistance near the $0.5350 level. The first major resistance is near the $0.5450 level. The next key resistance could be $0.5500. A clear move above the $0.5500 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5850 resistance. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.6640 swing high to the $0.5070 low. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.6000 resistance or even $0.6050 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.6250. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5450 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5220 level. The next major support is near the $0.5150 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5150 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5050 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.5000 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level.

Amid this maintenance above the $60,000 price level, analysts have continued to speculate on BTC’s future trajectory especially when the asset would make the play out of the long-anticipated rally to a major highs. One such analyst, CryptoBullet on X, has brought attention to a particular indicator— the Puell Multiple— suggesting that Bitcoin may be on the cusp of reaching a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Skyrocket To $118,000 By Year-End: Here’s Why Understanding The Puell Multiple According to CryptoBullet, the behavior of the Puell Multiple indicator often correlates with Bitcoin’s market cycles, potentially offering a clue into where the asset is headed next. The Puell Multiple, calculated by dividing the daily issuance of Bitcoin in USD by the 365-day moving average of the daily issuance, is used as a measure to understand the miners’ profitability and their potential influence on Bitcoin’s price. Historically, when the Puell Multiple entered its “Green Zone,” it indicated that Bitcoin may have reached a market bottom, which often preludes a significant upward trend. CryptoBullet points out that this phase of the cycle often sees Bitcoin bottoming out before starting its ascent toward a new ATH. #BTC Puell Multiple indicator 💡 This is why I think $BTC is not done yet and we’ll get a new ATH soon According to this chart, #Bitcoin Bear Markets end (#BTC finds the bottom) when Puell Multiple reaches the Green Zone Then Puell Multiple bounces as $BTC price prints the… pic.twitter.com/pL1ShFxcwE — CryptoBullet (@CryptoBullet1) October 6, 2024 Bitcoin Puell Multiple Hints At Potential New All-Time High CryptoBullet’s analysis shows how the Puell Multiple has behaved across different market cycles. Specifically, he noted that Bitcoin’s bear markets tend to end when the Puell Multiple hits the Green Zone, when Bitcoin finds a bottom. Once this bottom is established, the Puell Multiple begins to bounce, indicating the first significant upward leg in Bitcoin’s price movement. The significance of the Puell Multiple, according to CryptoBullet, lies in its pattern of “higher lows” and “higher highs.” After reaching the Green Zone, Bitcoin’s price often experiences a mid-term correction that corresponds with the Puell Multiple creating a higher low. From this point, both the price of Bitcoin and the Puell Multiple tend to rally upwards, often reaching new highs. Related Reading: Is The Worst Over For Bitcoin? Analyst Suggests Local Bottom May Be Here Currently, CryptoBullet believes that Bitcoin is in the early stages of its next significant leg up. The higher lows and a potential for higher highs in the Puell Multiple may signal that both Bitcoin’s price and its market momentum are aligning for another rally. In the context of Bitcoin’s current trajectory, this suggests that a potential breakout to a new ATH could be imminent.

There was a move below the $64,000 and $63,500 levels. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $61,723 swing low to the $64,41 high. Besides, there was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $63,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin price is now trading above $62,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. The bulls are also protecting the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $61,723 swing low to the $64,41 high. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $63,000 level. The first key resistance is near the $63,200 level. A clear move above the $63,200 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $64,000.

Immediate support on the downside is near the $62,500 level. The first major support is near the $61,750 level. The next support is now near the $61,200 zone.

34434860,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646720,1728352849,BlackRock Declares Bitcoin The New ‘Gold Alternative’ – Here’s Why,"BlackRock’s stance on cryptocurrencies—especially Bitcoin and Ethereum—has lately made headlines. While Ethereum is considered as a “technology bet,” the investment behemoth sees Bitcoin as a “gold alternative.” This point of view captures a major change in the way conventional finance is starting to welcome digital assets. Related Reading: Bittensor (TAO) Soars 130% – What’s Behind The Altcoin’s Recent Surge? The company’s findings show that people are becoming more and more sure that Bitcoin can protect against inflation, just like gold has in the past. BlackRock’s Chief Investment Officer, Rick Rieder, recently said that Bitcoin is appealing to investors who want to protect their wealth in uncertain economic times because there is a limited quantity. Many investors who are growingly concerned about market volatility and inflation will find resonance in this mindset. Bitcoin: The Modern Gold? For those looking for stability in the realm of finance, gold has traditionally been the preferred asset. BlackRock contends, though, that Bitcoin is filling in this function. As the company points out, Bitcoin’s limited supply and spread-out nature could make it a more interesting purchase than gold. Central banks around the world are printing money at rates that have never been seen before. This makes Bitcoin an even better way to save money. “More institutional investors entering the market will only speed up the acceptance of Bitcoin at an incredible rate,” says Rieder. With this new money coming in, demand will grow even faster, making Bitcoin even more of a digital gold standard. Additionally, BlackRock believes that with increased realization of worth and scarcity, the price of the blockchain will keep moving upwards. BlackRock considers Bitcoin a “risk-off” asset like gold. At a recent conference, BlackRock’s Robbie Mitchnick argued that Bitcoin might hedge against fiat currencies and government trust. Mitchnick said Bitcoin is a safe shelter for investors, especially during economic turmoil. As inflation, monetary devaluation, and banking crises develop, Bitcoin’s potential as a worldwide monetary alternative makes it important for financial security. Ethereum: A Technological Transformation Although Ethereum is seen via another perspective, Bitcoin attracts attention as a store of value. BlackRock sees Ethereum as a platform for innovation as much as a cryptocurrency. With its smart contract capability, developers may create decentralized apps (dApps), therefore transforming many sectors, including gaming and banking. Ethereum has great future potential. Ethereum demand may explode as more companies investigate blockchain technology. The analysts of BlackRock are positive about Ethereum’s future and indicate that its core technology might cause rapid increase in the coming years.

34432532,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=646688,1728347440,First Polkadot Core Sells For 69 DOT: Will Prices Move?,"Polkadot, an interoperable blockchain, continues to build. Less than a month after launching Agile Coretime, the first core was bought for 69 DOT over the weekend. This purchase is a significant milestone for the modern blockchain that’s been pushing to attract more users and developers on its rail by making block space accessibility easier and more flexible. Polkadot Coretime Purchased For 69 DOT According to on-chain data from the Coretime Hub, one core was bought for 69 DOT out of the five available for sale. The purchased amount was burned, a move that helps reduce inflation in the long term. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Could Hit $100,000 Before The End Of The Year Agile Coretime, which went live in September, is a massive boost for Polkadot. Under this framework, Polkadot seeks to allocate network resources more efficiently while offering greater accessibility and flexibility for new startups and developers planning to build. A core aspect of this framework is introducing a market-driven approach to block space data. In this model, it becomes easier for projects to purchase core, on-demand, or bulk, depending on their needs. Accordingly, projects can prudently use their resources, and the resulting flexibility is empowering. Polkadot developers also said Agile Coretime will enable developers to optimize for network performance. Beyond these advantages, since coretime can be traded as NFTs, it can create fresh avenues for monetization for smart traders. Reducing Inflation, Will Prices Recover? Even with this purchase, whether DOT’s inflation will rapidly fall in the coming months remains to be seen. Currently, the network’s inflation is at around 10%. However, the community has already voted and approved Referendum 1139, which seeks to reduce inflation from 10% to 8%. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst: Why Memecoins Are Still The Next 100x Opportunity Over time, developers will aim to further reduce inflation, even below 5%, depending on network growth, and a big part of Coretime purchases. The more users buy Coretime, the more DOT will be burnt and removed, reducing inflation. For now, even after the purchase of the first core DOT, it remains under immense selling pressure, mirroring the general performance across the board. Although DOT is still in the top 20, the coin is down nearly 70% from March highs. Any dump below $3.8 could accelerate the sell-off, pushing DOT to fresh 2024 lows.
