42377285,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70ACD,1400885911,BitPesa Launches Beta Testing for Kenyan Remittance Service,"Bitcoin remittance provider BitPesa has officially launched its beta test.  The Kenya-based company offers a 3% cut-rate fee, and is aiming to target the country's expats abroad who send $1.17bn home annually, according to The Wall Street Journal.  Users send their bitcoin to BitPesa, which then converts the amount into the local Kenyan currency and sends it on to the recipient. The service promises same-day delivery and no hidden fees.  BitPesa aims to disrupt a traditional remittance market that often imposes high costs on those wishing to use remittance services.  For example, the cost of sending money to Kenya by other means can be as much as 9.2% of the value being transferred by services like Western Union and MoneyGram, and 19.8% by banks, reports have found.  Disrupting the remittance market  Many have spoken to bitcoin’s potential in the remittance market, as cross-border money transfers otherwise come with weighty fees. The digital currency faces an uphill battle in that business though, mostly due to the costs of compliance and regulation.  Lawmakers’ attitudes toward bitcoin and digital currencies differ in each country – the kind of uncertainty that will become increasingly problematic as bitcoin gains popularity.  But BitPesa claims ""end-to-end regulatory compliance and KYC protocol"", helping to ""eliminate fraud, increase the growth of bank balances"" and gain back ""the trust of valued diaspora clients"", its website says.  Western Union currently accounts for about 31% of the total market, and MoneyGram 6%. Commercial banks account for 50%  BitPesa's competition  Still, while BitPesa is closer to reaching the market, it's not the only operator trying to use the power of the Bitcoin protocol to improve the global remittance process.  Coincove entered the bitcoin remittance market last year for Latin American expats from Argentina, Mexico, Spain and Chile, and BuyBitcoin.ph did the same one month later for Filipino expats.  Notably, Coincove saw its formal launch earlier this week, and though it offers and exchange and wallet service, it still sees a big opportunity in the remittance space.

42377298,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70ANX,1400881564,"All Things Alt: Vertcoin Gets Hot, a Bitcoin-Backed Coin and a Crypto Confession","This week, we've seen new coins come, old ones go and, in between, a pump and dump or two.  Ups and downs aside, like every other week in alternative digital currency, it was a week that produced some interesting news. Read on for just a slice of the never-ending surprises coming out of the alt world today.  A mineable alt backed by bitcoin mining  Digital currencies backed up by some sort of asset aren't necessarily new. There are several altcoins that are pegged to the value of gold, silver or other precious metals. Others buttress the market price through multipool arrangements — this is most commonly seen among proof-of-stake coins.  Virtualminingcoin  goes straight to the source, leveraging gigahashes (GH/s) purchased on the mining commodities exchange CEX.io to generate bitcoin that is subsequently used to buy virtualminingcoins.  The Scrypt-N Adaptive coin debuted with an IPO, the proceeds from which were used to fund the initial GH/s investment on CEX.io. The virtualminingcoin team intends to reinvest in additional hashing power based on the future value of the coin and the overall profitability of mining BTC.  At press time, the virtualminingcoin team has purchased 1.6 Th/s in mining power, according to its website.  Vertcoin gets cooking  Looking to add a little zest to your next meal? Have some vertcoins sitting in your wallet?  If so, you're in luck thanks to VTCal Sauce, a new offering from Pex Peppers, a purveyor of chili seeds, sauces and jellies based in Pennsylvania.  VTCal Sauce  is billed as a way to ""ignite all your tacos aflame"".  The sauce features jalapeno chilies, garlic, cumin and a dash of lime juice. Pex Peppers gives it a four-out-of-10 on the hot scale, meaning that you won't singe your tongue to badly with this crypto-centered hot sauce.  The owner of Pex Peppers told CoinDesk that VTCal is designed to be an all-around great hot sauce reflecting the strengths behind digital currency technology, saying:  ""The flavors are perfectly balanced, just like the block chain.""  VTCal isn't Pex Pepper's first crypto-themed sauce. It also sells a To The Moon Shibe Sauce, which the company dubs ""every shibe's dream sauce"".  The pump and dump blues  It sort of goes without saying that the alt world has seen its fair share of pumps and dumps. In the past week alone, riches have been made and many a bitcoin have been lost by traders chasing gains in some of the busiest markets.  Pump-and-dump events, for better or for worse, have driven interest and buying power around certain alts.  While these events don't necessarily speak to the broader strengths and weaknesses of a particular altcoin, there's no doubt that such a circumstance can lead to a deterioration in the perception — and long-term price health — of a coin.  Altcoin pump-and-dumps go wrong when well-meaning buyers find themselves holding a supply of coins that are far less valuable than they may have been several hours before. Traders who acquire a large amount of coins in relatively illiquid markets have the power to literally move markets. Once they exit, those left ""holding the bag"" face a great degree of difficulty in recouping the original value of the coins they bought.  For example, libertycoin (sign: XLB) had an impressive run this week on the MintPal digital currency exchange.  Just 24 hours before press time, the price of a single libertycoin hovered around 0.00005 BTC. Within hours, the price surged to a peak of 0.00018999 BTC, constituting more than 1,500 BTC in volume. Within two hours of the peak, the price declined to 0.0001 BTC before climbing slightly.  At press time, the price of a single libertycoin is roughly 0.00011 BTC.  Strange alt of the week  Feeling guilty about selling some coins? Wish you hadn't spent all that money on a GPU?  If so, you can now confess to your sins - and pay for them - with a new altcoin.  Confessioncoin is built on the premise that users can submit their recent wrongdoings and then use the new proof-of-work scrypt coin to absolve themselves of their sin.  A new website, which has yet to be launched, is designed to interpret admissions of guilt and then decide how many confessioncoins need to be spent before the user is forgiven.  For creating a platform of guilt absolution and a currency to facilitate this forgiveness within a blockchain, confessioncoin has won this week's Strange Alt of the Week award.  With a 70 million max supply limit, 45-second block time and 10-coin block reward, confessioncoin is pitched to those who want to wipe away their sins.  The developer wrote on the Bitcoin Talk forum:  ""Peace of mind is surely worth the small price! In exchange for your penance, your confession will be stored anonymously in the block chain, immortalized forever.""  Confessioncoin is set for a 26th May launch. Whether or not this concept takes off remains to be seen, but in the words of one Bitcoin Talk user, the project is certainly interesting in that each confession will be ""a secret only the blockchain knows"".

42377283,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70A9h,1400879424,Falcon Global Capital Hires Lobbyists to Promote Bitcoin in Washington,"Falcon Global Capital has filed to register lobbyists on Capitol Hill in an effort to further “education and understanding of bitcoin and other crypto-graphic based currencies”.  Greater bitcoin discussion in Congress should give lawmakers more familiarity and comfort with the concept, currently misrepresented by its scandals and its volatility.  Co-founder Brett Stapper said:  ""In our discussions and debates we have realized that those who oppose bitcoin don't really oppose it, they simply don't understand it.""  Though more US politicians are taking an active interest in the technology, awareness remains low, leading many to worry that the US government could seek to implement unfavorable or restrictive policies for the industry.  Fighting back  Falcon’s move follows that of government relations group Peck Madigan Jones, who last month pressured Capitol Hill by putting “bitcoin and mobile payments” on its lobbying agenda.  Clients of PMJ include Deloitte, Wells Fargo Securities, US Chamber of Commerce and MasterCard, among others. Given these notable names, the development caused widespread concern in the bitcoin community.  As bitcoin’s popularity increases, so does the need for representation in Congress, especially if well-established companies in the banking and finance industries use their weight in Washington to obstruct the digital currency’s growth.  Having government support is one of the most critical issues the bitcoin community faces, Stapper said.  ""Our main concern is that our elected officials will pass regulations without being fully educated on the topic which could have a negative impact on the bitcoin ecosystem.""      Investment funding rising    The San Diego-based bitcoin investment fund aims to give investors greater exposure to bitcoin by purchasing large amounts for them – between $25,000 to $10,000,000 – and storing them in a digital vault, providing clients “an easy entry and exit point”, its website states.  However, it's far from the only player. California-based bitcoin-only venture fund Pantera launched an investment fund this March, amid new enthusiasm that Wall Street investors will look to support the bitcoin movement in 2014 and beyond.

42377288,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70AEj,1400878227,How True Anonymity Made Darkcoin King of the Altcoins,"If you’re looking to conduct truly anonymous transactions, bitcoin isn't the perfect digital currency to use.  While personal identities are not shared via the bitcoin network, it is still possible to identify wallet addresses and follow transactions through the block chain.  For a real anonymous coin, you’ll need to turn to darkcoin, a digital currency launched in January that is storming the cryptocurrency scene with its pioneering energy-efficient mining algorithm and multifaceted, identity-protecting features.  Enthusiasm for the digital currency has been fueled by darkcoin’s price gains in recent weeks, as the coin has seemingly successfully appealed to many buyers who once turned to bitcoin for its supposed anonymity.  At press time, the price of one DRK is roughly $13 per coin, exceeding the price of litecoin and nearly all other major altcoins on CoinMarketCap.com.  Darkcoin's risky rise  What’s fueling this dramatic growth?  CoinDesk spoke with darkcoin developer Evan Duffield, who explained that the digital currency aims to bring true anonymity to online transactions, saying:  “The whole goal of [darkcoin] was to be a privacy-centered cryptocurrency.”  Darkcoin's facilitation of anonymous transactions seemingly confirms fears among regulators and law enforcement agencies that digital currencies propagate transactions that are untraceable.  In practice, the coin's technological aspects act to conceal identities through several different approaches.  DarkSend facilitates network anonymity  One of the major components of darkcoin is DarkSend, a peer-to-peer framework that bundles small transactions into larger anonymous ones.  DarkSend is based on the CoinJoin concept created by bitcoin developer Gregory Maxwell, which acts as a transaction bundler. In the case of darkcoin, this merger makes it far more difficult for someone to ascertain the source and destination of payments within the network.  DarkSend also incorporates an infrastructure of masternodes that handle the transactions in a decentralized manner. Functioning in what Duffield calls a ""proof-of-service"" system, masternodes act as the transaction bundlers and receive 10% of the block reward for doing so.  There is a masternode election system that randomly assigns which masternode will process a bundle of darkcoin transactions. According to Duffield, masternodes effectively receive dividends that even out across the network over time.  Notably, it costs 1,000 DRK to set up a masternode. This, Duffield explains, ensures that only those who get involved in running the network have a vested interest in participating, as well as prevent bad actors from spying on the transactions taking place in the darkcoin network.  He said:  ""There has to be costs associated, so you don’t capture all of the traffic and reassemble the block chain.""  A more detailed explanation of the masternode framework and election system can be found in the original darkcoin whitepaper written by Duffield and developer Kyle Hagan.  An energy-efficient mining algorithm  Duffield told CoinDesk that, in part, darkcoin also seeks to solve some of the problems associated with proof-of-work mining, namely energy costs.  The X11 mining algorithm  , since deployed in several new digital currencies, delivers notable benefits including a closer parity between GPU- and CPU-based mining rigs.  Duffield said that, from the beginning, he sought a new kind of mining algorithm. Interestingly, X11 was developed to be slightly less efficient than other alternatives. While this may seem counterintuitive to the mining process, with miners seeking greater efficiency to deliver more hashing power, Duffield explained that several key advantages came as a result of this development path.  First, CPU-based miners and GPU-based miners perform at similar rates. This widens the appeal of the algorithm, enabling more people to get involved in the mining process without having to invest in more hardware.  Additionally, X11 allows for more energy-efficient mining. Duffield said that most mining rigs run about 30% cooler than those running on alternative proof-of-work algorithms. This factor, Duffield suggested, has lent itself to the greatly expanded hashing power in the darkcoin network and provided a boon to hobby miners who can’t afford large-scale cooling infrastructure.  Ultimately, Duffield pointed out, the development team sought do something new within the digital currency world, saying:  ""I wanted to implement [darkcoin] so we could have a completely new algorithm and follow the same path that bitcoin follows.""  By doing so, he said, the community at-large would innovate from the ground up.  A solution to bitcoin's mining issues  Bitcoin, like most digital currencies, features scheduled reward halvings that reduce the amount of coins produced in each block. This poses a potential issue for the mining community, according to the darkcoin white paper:  ""One problem with this approach is the abrupt reward halving that happens every four years. This could eventually cause large distortions in the mining network when the profitability of mining changes drastically overnight.""  To solve this problem, darkcoin utilizes a reward curve based on the mining difficult at the given time. With a range of five to 25, the new reward structure puts in place an inflationary dynamic that delivers approximately 1m new DRK to the network each year.  Additionally, darkcoin addresses a problem associated with the multipool ecosystem, by which large mining pools disrupt a coin network by dramatically expanding the overall hashrate. DarkGravityWave adjusts the difficulty using multipole exponential moving averages a simple moving average.  This, according to the white paper, limits the multipool impact on the network and eliminates certain exploits possible through Kimoto’s Gravity Well, a per-block difficult adjustment scheme that is widely used in the altcoin community.  Looking ahead  If the price of darkcoin is any indication, the digital currency is set for a potentially bright future, at least in terms of user popularity.  Duffield told CoinDesk that the development team is working on several new initiatives that would greatly expand the possibility of a truly anonymous transaction network.  Notably, Duffield is seeking to implement a system for building services on the darkcoin network. For example, someone could host a cloud wallet service that takes advantage of the speed and anonymity provided by the network.  ""Its part of this proof-of-service concept. [Masternodes] can actually host other services for the network, and they will be super-fast because of that, because they’re dedicated just for darkcoin.""  Duffield expects the number of masternodes to expand overtime, of which he said roughly 100 exist. Because the creation of a masternode involves takes 1,000 DRK out of the coin supply, more nodes could actually support the natural value of the coin. He added that, in the end, as many as 400 nodes could be created to facilitate transactions in the network.  Ultimately, darkcoin is taking the idea of anonymous financial transactions pioneered by bitcoin and pushing it to the next level. However, it's possible regulators could have a final say as to its ultimate success.

42377280,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70A8R,1400872356,Former US Mint Chief: Bitcoin a Serious Challenge to Government Money,"Edmund C. Moy, the former director of the US Mint — the government body responsible for producing the country's physical coins, made waves in the bitcoin community this week when he took to Twitter to voice his enthusiasm for digital currencies.  Moy's comments were issued in response to the most recent $2.6bn Credit Suisse settlement, in which the Switzerland-based banking giant pleaded guilty to helping clients evade taxes.  In light of this news, the 38th Director of the US Mint went so far as to suggest that digital currency could provide the answer to current problems in the financial system, writing:    $2.6B fine 'won't do much damage': Credit Suisse CEO. It's time banks got competition. Time for cryptocurrencies. http://t.co/OT3dBTDlrq      — Edmund Moy (@EdmundCMoy) May 22, 2014    However, Moy didn't stop there. The former member of the Department of Homeland Security took to his blog on 23rd May to issue an entire post on how bitcoin is leading to ""a revolution in payment systems"".  Moy wrote:  ""Bitcoin, and the ideas behind it, will be a disruptor to the traditional notions of currency. In the end, currency will be better for it.""  The full post lightheartedly addressed bitcoin and its strengths and weaknesses, with Moy offering a perhaps surprisingly optimistic assessment of how the technology will impact the global financial marketplace.  Bitcoin removes government monopolies  Perhaps most notably, Moy suggested that digital currencies can even help prevent some of the more severe drawbacks associated with fiat currencies. In particular, he predicts it will eliminate what he views as the government monopoly on money, writing:  ""It has a low risk of collapse unlike a sovereign government’s currency (just ask the Greeks or more broadly, the European Union).""  Moy acknowledged this as a positive, even if he realized the innovation would likely threaten his former employer.  He added: ""You can mine your own bitcoins. No mint needed!""  Bitcoin an innovative means of exchange  Moy was also enthusiastic about bitcoin's potential to offer a new way for global consumers to transact, stating:  ""As a medium of exchange, bitcoin offers several unique innovations to currency: global nature, infinite divisibility and easy to carry.""  Calling today's transaction systems ""archaic"", he argued that bitcoin's ability to divide effortlessly would allow for new methods of monetization via micropayments, and that it could eliminate existing barriers to global markets.  Bitcoin will be a safe store of value  Moy was equally positive about bitcoin as a store of value, saying that he believes bitcoin's price will become more stable as it's adopted by mainstream consumers.  However, he took aim at critics of the idea who believe that government-backed alternatives are perhaps more secure, saying that the US dollar is driven mostly by market demand.  As an added benefit, he theorized bitcoin could even allow governments the ability to dedicate more time to monetary policy that could positively impact their economies should it reach its full potential.

42377281,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70A7B,1400869874,German Bitcoin Tax Proposal Would Sting Merchants Twice,"Germany's Federal Ministry of Finance, the Bundesministerium der Finanzen (BMF), has published a new document suggesting that the commercial sale of bitcoins should be taxed, a development local sources say has the potential to greatly impact the use of the digital currency as a payment method.  The document  , issued in response to a parliamentary question submitted by Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party member Dr Tim Ostermann, states that the commercial sale of bitcoin is a ""miscellaneous service"", and thus, needs to be taxed under German law.  As a result of the potential decision, retailers who accept bitcoin would be taxed twice during transactions – firstly, on the sale of goods and, secondly, when they seek to sell bitcoins they accept in purchases.  The news follows the decision by the UK, one of the only countries in Europe to have imposed a value-added tax (VAT) on bitcoin transactions, to drop this policy amid pressure from local enthusiasts and interest groups.  Staunch resistance  Perhaps unsurprisingly, the decision was met with resistance by local trade group Bundesverband Bitcoinhttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/05/20/willkommen-germany-welkom-netherlands/, one of the newest additions to the Bitcoin Foundation's international affiliate programme.  In a lengthy response, the group denounced the idea as one that would discourage the use of bitcoin by traders and online merchants, writing:  ""If this kind of taxation stands, it will [hinder] decentralized payment systems [...] in Germany.""  Bundesverband Bitcoin said it will seek the support of German retailers to lobby against the proposal by the BMF, potentially looking for intervention from the European Court of Justice, an EU organisation that seeks to establish common laws throughout member states.  Loopholes possible  While a potential issue for small merchants, Bundesverband Bitcoin board member and legal expert Oliver Flaskämper suggested that many German businesses would be unaffected by the proposal, should it be formalised, telling CoinDesk:  ""Since over 90% of all dealers in Germany work together with payment service providers of the US like BitPay and Coinbase, these transactions are not liable to VAT.""  However, Flaskämper is optimistic that the precedent set by the UK would be enough to resolve the matter, adding: ""We assume that the opinion of Great Britain will prevail in this matter ultimately"".  Fighting for innovation  Though international services could stem the damage of the decision, Mark Preuss, editor and founder of local bitcoin news and information service BTC-Echo, suggested that the law would most importantly impact innovation in Germany:  ""This law would only weaken the German high-tech industry. [...] People will use payment processors abroad, and gains will be made by countries that embrace technical innovation.""  He concluded by stating that, while the BMF should follow its interpretations of existing law, he hopes the agency puts its responsibility to society and German businesses first.

42377277,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70A4f,1400867439,Up Close With the New MultiBit HD Bitcoin Wallet,"MultBit has been quietly dropping scraps of information about its new MultBit HD wallet for months now. At the recent Bitcoin2014 conference, Jim Burton and Gary Rowe of MultiBit gave CoinDesk a hands-on preview of the new software.  One of the most popular wallets out there  , MultiBit gets around 4,500 downloads every day. Since its launch in 2011, MultiBit has been downloaded 1.8 million times.  That’s a lot of users and a great deal of pressure when it comes to producing a product that will last. Rowe said:  “We wanted [to build] software that could scale up to tens of millions of people.”  The new wallet is less of a redesign and more of a reimagination of their wallet; it has been totally rebuilt from the ground up.  On the surface, the changes are obvious. In the current version of MultiBit – known as MultiBit Classic in anticipation of the new wallet – the technical aspects of bitcoin are clearly on show. Your address is shown in its raw form, for example.  MultiBit HD hides all of that away behind a clean design that’s heavy on accessibility. Large buttons make navigating the interface intuitive and it now includes a more refined contacts list, creating the sense that you're sending money to a person instead of a string of letters and numbers.  ""This is the kind of wallet you can give your mum,"" says Rowe.  Exacting standards  Under the hood, the software incorporates the standards that the most demanding bitcoin users would expect. MultiBit HD will be compatible with the Trezor hardware wallet and the HD label refers to the fact that it will be a ""hierarchical deterministic"" wallet, meaning that you will be able to regain access to addresses created by MultiBit HD with a single 'seed' passphrase.  Additionally, Burton and Rowe are working on integrating multisig functionality, which means that you can protect addresses by requiring several different private keys before transactions can be authorized, and Tor, adding an extra level of privacy for users.  More cutting-edge privacy features such as CoinJoin and stealth addresses, both of which are used in Dark Wallet, are ""lower on our priority list"" says Rowe:  ""We strongly support technologies that improve our user's privacy and security. Due to our popularity and limited resources for development we have to be conservative about adding new technology until it has proven itself in the bitcoin ecosystem.""  The software is now in early, private beta with a maximum audience of around 1,000 people.  Those who are interested in helping its development should contact MultiBit via its website. Burton says the company wants to make sure all the kinks are ironed out before it goes out to a wider audience.  ""People want bulletproof, high-quality software,"" says Burton.

It also includes its own digital currency, known as 'safecoins', to facilitate the transactions necessary to use the network. Users allowing their machines to be SAFE network nodes can earn safecoins, and more passive users must spend them to gain access.  Developers who build services for the SAFE network will also earn safecoins. MaidSafe calls this funding mechanism ""the first open-source business model that works"".  Developers can code their safecoin wallet addresses into their apps and be paid by the network according to popularity.  MaidSafe says its platform removes risks that developers and startups often face by giving them complete freedom to innovate and control over their data. The network's peer-to-peer nature means that even authentication credentials are not managed by any central authority, and the exact physical location of data is never known.  The same benefits would apply to everyday users, who could store files and interact freely without third-party involvement.  Company background  MaidSafe has been around since 2006, longer than bitcoin, and has attracted its fair share of controversy in that time.  The recent, slightly convoluted, crowd sale of 'MaidSafeCoins' (a prototypical currency to be exchanged 1:1 later for safecoins) offered an exchange rate favouring mastercoin, allowing mastercoin holders to dominate the sale and shut out many bitcoin-holding buyers. Organizers had to step in and plead for order.  The company has also faced questions over whether the authorities would ever allow such a system to function properly, especially given the concerns often raised about existing networks that allow anonymous Internet use, like Tor.  Some popular websites block Tor users and there are questions over whether node operators can be liable for the anonymous traffic that flows through their systems.  Freedom is key  MaidSafe says locating individual files is impossible due to shredding and encryption, and that judging the ways users might abuse its technology is not within its purview:  ""Just like Linus Torvalds isn't responsible for anybody who might be storing illegal files on a Linux OS hard drive, or just like Satoshi Nakamoto wasn't responsible for every drug purchased on Silk Road (or the links to child porn embedded in the block chain),"" a project representative said.  New technology is bound to create new legal territory in any case.  ""We're confident that when such mass adoption takes place, the law will adapt in a way that protects blameless parties.""  ""At least in principle, it wouldn't be much different than having one's machine compromised and used to power an illegal botnet,"" he concluded.

42377289,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70AFz,1400855016,Coinbase Adds Bitcoin Payment Protocol For Safer Transactions,"Bitcoin payments processor Coinbase has added support for the bitcoin payment protocol.  Called BIP 70, the protocol allows communication between a merchant and its customers when transactions are made, and was designed to provide additional security and improve the customer experience.  Coinbase says BIP 70 will offer improved protection against man-in-the-middle attacks on the payment process.  Safer transactions  Addition of the protocol brings new features that should come in useful for many merchants:  Human-readable, secure payment destinations – customers will be asked to authorize payment to a payment processor identified as “example.com” (or “Example, Inc.” if an extended validation certificate is used) instead of an inscrutable, 34-character bitcoin address.  Secure proof of payment, which the customer can use in case of a dispute with the merchant.  Resistance from man-in-the-middle attacks that replace a merchant’s bitcoin address with an attacker’s address before a transaction is authorized with a hardware wallet.  'Payment received' messages, so the customer knows immediately that the merchant has received, and has processed (or is processing) their payment.  Refund addresses, automatically given to the merchant by the customer’s wallet software, so merchants do not have to contact customers before refunding overpayments or orders that cannot be fulfilled for some reason.  The protocol will be automatically enabled for all merchants, but Coinbase says the protocol is supported on all of its wallets.  Both merchants and the company's regular users can benefit from BIP 70, however, it is not enabled for regular users by default. For that, they need to access the advanced user settings.  BIP 70 in action  Coinbase has posted a simple demo on its blog, showing the protocol in action, in a simple transaction between two Coinbase users, while the full BIP 70 specification is available on Github.  The bitcoin payment protocol was also adopted by BitPay earlier this year, and provides a similar demo here, along with additional information on BIP 70 and its real life applications.

Perhaps more interestingly for bitcoin, the announcement indicated that digital currencies could be treated as cash, not commodities, for the purposes of taxation.  Watching bitcoin  According to a report on RTVE.es, the statement was made in response to the Socialist Treasury spokesman in Congress, Pedro Saura, who had requested clarification of the rules applying to the acquisition and use of digital currencies, such as bitcoin.  He had further asked whether the government had any plans to bring in specific legislation to prevent tax evasion through these emerging payment methods.  In his response, the government confirmed that the AEAT's National Bureau of Fraud Investigation will ""monitor developments"" within digital currencies to see if they ""would jeopardize tax controls or be used in money laundering schemes or for other illicit purposes"".  It was also pointed out that digital currencies are still a very young technology and their use is extremely restricted in Spain.  Cash not commodity?  Intriguingly, the government spokesperson seemed to indicate that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could be considered by the authorities to be forms of money and not commodities – unlike the US, which has taken the opposite stance and considers bitcoin to be property for the purposes of taxation.  The government spokesperson pointed out an existing regulation (article 34.2 of law 10/2010), which means that cash transactions, in which any of the parties is acting as either an employer or a professional, are not permitted in amounts greater than 2,500 euros or the equivalent in foreign currency .  This law is aimed to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing, they said, and includes payments by ""any other physical means, including electronic, designed to be used as payment to the carrier.""  The spokesperson indicated that if the monetary and financial authorities consider that bitcoin is a form of monetary payment, the same limitations would apply as with cash.  Community reactions  Speaking to CoinDesk, local bitcoin enthusiast Axel Roffi said the announcement could be ""good news"", adding:  ""The thing is that the Spanish political class has absolutely no clue of what is happening and what bitcoin is all about. [...] I really think that bitcoin [should] have regulations at the European Union level.""  Bitcoin being considered money would be welcomed by Spanish businesses and users, he continued, ""but what would be a lot better is that bitcoin had more exposure in the news and more bitcoin evangelists that would go knock on the doors of small and medium businesses and expose the [advantages] of using bitcoin"".  Amuda Goueli, CEO of Spain's first bitcoin-accepting travel agency Destinia, was more guarded about the news and confirmed that the status of bitcoin is still a grey area, saying:  ""The Spanish government has yet to determine if bitcoin payments should be treated like cash payments, in which case there is a 2,500 euro limit for transactions within Spain. Since we don't know whether to apply this law or not, we have decided to play on the safe side.""  ""There has been no real change in the ambiguous legal status of bitcoins in Spain,"" he said. ""The government has simply stated that they are 'watching' the flow of bitcoins to make sure that they are not used for money laundering and other crimes.""  It is, however, good news the authorities have realised that bitcoins exist, Goueli indicated, explaining:  ""When we asked one government department about bitcoins a few months ago, they didn't even know what they were!""

42377290,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70AIV,1400848216,HashFast is Just One Hearing Away From Involuntary Bankruptcy,"Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer HashFast is just one hearing away from being forced into involuntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  The company is currently entangled in a number of disputes with customers demanding shipment of various bitcoin miners, including mining company Liquidbits.  Liquidbits is taking action over the company’s failure to fulfil a $6m order and has petitioned a San Francisco court to appoint a Chapter 7 bankruptcy trustee. As a result, the court has agreed to hold an emergency hearing today.  If the petition is granted, HashFast could be forced into involuntary bankruptcy and the trustee will proceed to liquidate the company’s assets.  Bankruptcy denial  In addition to Liquidbits, another group of customers has filed a similar petition, claiming that their orders, totalling $330,000, have not been fulfilled.  Ars Technica spoke to HashFast CEO Eduardo deCastro who said the company is as “poor as a church mouse”, admitting that HashFast was forced to practically empty its bank accounts in order to pay out refunds.  Prior to interview, HashFast announced that it laid off 50% of its staff, but claimed it is not headed into bankruptcy.  HashFast representative Joe Russel told CoinDesk that the company is looking to become more transparent and more effective at communicating with its customers.  Blame game  In the candid talk with Ars Technica a few weeks ago, the company admitted a number of big mistakes, such as hiring an unsatisfactory printed circuit board design and having to halt sales as a result last December. DeCastro added:  “We just hired a contractor we shouldn't have hired.”  LiquidBits pulled out of the deal because HashFast was not able to fulfil the the contract and the following shortfall in income forced the manufacturer to revise its accounts.  “Our whole financial plan was [consequently] based on how the money was going to come in,” HashFast CTO Simon Barber said.  Barber insisted the company wants to do all it can to fulfil orders and refund its customers. He said HashFast has “lots of chips on hand” and that it can deliver more hashing power than initially promised.  The companies tried to salvage the deal and renegotiated to convert LiquidBits' order for 2,500 Sierra miners into 30,000 Golden Nonce ASICs. Liquidbits has claimed it took delivery of only 2,000 chips in April.  Liquidbits CEO Gregory Bacharach said he then “engaged in efforts” to obtain either the remaining 28,000 chips or a refund for the amount paid for the undelivered chips, adding:  “Each time I was told by HashFast personnel that HashFast was not in a position to refund the money.”  HashFast is facing similar legal challenges from Koi Systems, DigiMex and individual miners.  Furthermore Bacharach alleged that HashFast is trying to sell off remaining inventory abroad, in violation of a binding arbitration order that forbids the company from doing so.

42395326,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaLbT,1400841654,Stolen eBay Database On Sale for Bitcoin is Fake,"Earlier this week it was revealed that e-commerce giant eBay fell victim to a sophisticated cyber attack and that its use database had been breached.  In the days following the attack a curious Pastebin posting appeared online, offering to sell eBay’s breached database for 1.45BTC. However, eBay insists the database on sale is not authentic.  The hack  The security breach has been described as one of the biggest cyber attacks of its kind in history.  More than 230 million buyers and sellers have an account with eBay and the company is asking all of them to change their passwords. The number of active accounts is much lower, but at 128 million it is still very high indeed. As many as 145 million accounts were affected by the breach.  Luckily PayPal accounts were not compromised. Although eBay owns the popular payments processor, the two systems are not interconnected and PayPal was not affected by the attack. However, there is a chance that some users chose to use the same credentials on both services.  The stolen eBay data was hashed, so it might take the attackers quite a bit of time before they decrypt the database. The problem is that the attack took place a couple of months ago, but it was not detected or reported.  Indecent proposal  The Pastebin offer included a 3,000-row extract from the database, listing users in the Asia Pacific region.  The extract allowed eBay to deduce that the offer was just a ploy to get free bitcoins from those who fell for it. An eBay representative told The Guardian that the published lists were checked for authenticity and eBay quickly concluded they were not authentic.  The company says there is no evidence that the passwords were decrypted. The database was hashed and salted.  — Ask eBay (@AskeBay) May 22, 2014  Although the 1.45BTC offer is bogus and there is no evidence to suggest any of the passwords was decrypted, all eBay users are advised to change their passwords as a precaution.  Historically, similar attacks have been used as fodder by some bitcoin proponents, as they expose the inherent vulnerability of centralised systems.  For its part, eBay hasn't shut the door on the cryptocurrency entirely. Last month CEO John Donahoe said digital currency will play an important role in the future and confirmed that the company is considering enabling bitcoin payments via PayPal.
