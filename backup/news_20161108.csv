42399487,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjFFd,1478641371,Gemini Expands Bitcoin and Ether Exchange to New Asian Markets,"Digital currency exchange Gemini announced yesterday that it is opening its services to traders in South Korea and Japan.  The move  comes just over a year after Gemini first opened its doors in New York. The exchange, which had been in the works since early 2015, came online following its successful bid for a bank charter. Yet the exchange struggled to find traders following its launch, and may be looking past US shores in a bid to attract more activity.  Customers in both countries will have access to bitcoin and ether trading, both markets of which will trade against the US dollar. South Korean and Japanese customers will also have access to Gemini's daily bitcoin auction.  The company said:  ""These dynamic East Asian economies have long embraced the growth of bitcoin and other digital assets, and our expansion to Japan and South Korea represents another milestone in Gemini’s pursuit of building a global next generation digital asset exchange.""  Gemini's launch in the two Asian countries comes during a dynamic period for them both. Some of South Korea's biggest payment companies are moving to integrate the technology underlying bitcoin, while several of its bank look to launch next-generation remittance solutions.  Conditions in Japan – home of the now-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox – are perhaps more ripe for expansion. Last month, local sources reported that Japan's government is moving to drop a sales tax on bitcoin after classifying it under domestic law as a kind of prepaid payment instrument.

42399483,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjFEe,1478632867,Inspector General: IRS Needs to Overhaul Bitcoin Tax Strategy,"The US Internal Revenue Service needs to overhaul its strategy for bitcoin and other digital currencies, the agency's inspector general (IG) warned in a report released today.  Originally prepared by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) in September, the report casts a gloomy portrait of the US tax agency’s efforts to oversee and tax digital currency transactions.  According to the TIGTA, there is ""little evidence"" that US tax officials have moved to create a broader, more cohesive strategy in the two-and-a-half years since the agency declared its intention to tax bitcoin as a kind of property. Other issues include a lack of controls for third-party tools used to report transactions.  A continued failure to address the concerns means that the IRS is at risk of missing taxpayer violations, the report warned.  The IG wrote:  ""The IRS needs to ensure that it develops a strategic plan that includes management oversight as well as adequate internal controls for its virtual currency programs. Until a comprehensive virtual currency strategy is developed, the IRS is open to the risk that undetected noncompliance of virtual currency taxable transactions will result in an increase to the Tax Gap.""  Compounding the current state of affairs, the report goes on to outline, is the fact that the agency failed to respond to or otherwise adopt proposals made via public comment after the 2014 policy release.  The IRS has faced criticism in the past from tax professionals, who argued that the agency hadn’t provided consumers with enough information regarding the taxation of bitcoin and other digital currencies. In its report, the IG acknowledged that the 2014 policy release was problematic regarding some of the reporting mandates, particularly relating to documentation.  “Due to the potential complexity of reporting otherwise simple retail purchase transactions related to virtual currencies, further guidance is needed to help taxpayers voluntarily comply with their tax obligations,” the IG said.  Yet the agency is committed to change. In the report, the IG said that the IRS had agreed to improve its existing bitcoin tax practices, with an eye to potentially rework how its reporting documents are structured.  In total, the TIGTA issued three recommendations, and in all cases, the IRS agreed with the findings.

Unveiled  late last month, the updated dashboard helps bridge the two main parts of Coinbase's business – a bitcoin storage tool and exchange. Coinbase launched the new user experience today, a move that takes it out of an early beta trial.  The redesign follows a busy year for Coinbase. So far, the bitcoin startup has embraced ethereum (despite criticism from some quarters of the community) and raised $10.5m in new funding from sources including the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ.  The company even launched trading for litecoin this summer.  In sum, those events signaled Coinbase’s shift from serving primarily as a bitcoin wallet to an exchange for digital currencies and assets – an evolution the startup actively invoked when unveiling the new dashboard.  ""This launch is an early but significant step in our transformation from a wallet to a digital asset platform,"" the company said in a blog post.

42399476,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjF8k,1478620505,"In 2016 US Election, Bitcoin and Blockchain Were Blips on Campaign Radar","As the US election ramped up last summer, the CoinDesk editorial team began to wonder: Given the mistrust in banks and financial firms, would bitcoin and blockchain become an election issue?  The answer, it turned out, was a resounding no, as neither major party candidate weighed in substantively on the issue.  CoinDesk spent much of the past year and a half attempting to engage with the campaigns of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump to no avail. Phone calls to their respective headquarters in Brooklyn and Manhattan went unanswered.  We saw Clinton's campaign pay lip service to the tech in a broad policy statement, only to learn months later that her senior campaign officials saw the digital currency as ""too Libertarian"" to accept. In one case, spokeswoman Hope Hicks declined comment by email – a degree of responsiveness the Clinton campaign would fail to achieve.  We thought we might get lucky. In the end, to quote Donald Trump, we were wrong. Nor did the campaigns of early hopefuls like Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders engage with us either (though there was a promising start in the latter case).  Ultimately, none of the major candidates would go on the record with any publication about the tech or the sweeping changes it promises to bring to industries and consumers.  Yet, this isn’t to say the election didn’t have its moments.  Kentucky Senator Rand Paul spoke openly about bitcoin, as did Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson, both of whom accepted donations in the digital currency. (We also asked the campaign for Green Party candidate Jill Stein what they thought, but our calls went unreturned).  Minor progress  Still, in the midst of it all, we saw Congress push for broad action on the tech (in as legally nonbinding a way as possible). One proposal even sought to potentially rethink how we manage health care for veterans using blockchain.  We also saw the start of a process at the top US elections watchdog to perhaps reclassify what a bitcoin donation is exactly. Along the way, some would speculate that particular winners might push bitcoin markets this way or that.  So, there was movement, albeit in a piecemeal fashion.  One could even argue that the stage was set for 2020 to be the presidential election year that bitcoin and blockchain become a campaign issue or even gets asked about in a presidential debate (our attempts to get a bitcoin question into the Democratic Party and GOP debates in New Hampshire were unsuccessful).  With Congressional action on the tech likely to happen over the next four years, there might soon be change. Here’s hoping.

42399470,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjDPV,1478614514,"As Argentina Embraces Blockchain, Emphasis on Politics Remains","Argentineans may be best known for their love crush on bitcoin, but the country's interest in its underlying technology, the blockchain, is growing.  That, at least, was the message of participants at the Latin American Bitcoin Conference (LaBitConf), which took place in Argentina this week.  Overall, downtown Buenos Aires provided a curious and action-packed backdrop for LaBitConf and its 450 attendees, as the venue was only few blocks away from several anti-government protests that underscored the social value many entrepreneurs still see in the technology.  For most attending the conference, the takeaway was that the local community is now more mature than it was in 2013, and that bitcoin and blockchain are now starting to be used more in ""real life"".  Indeed, blockchain technology is inspiring Argentinean entrepreneurs to use the technology in ways that are lined up with bitcoin's original ethos, such as lowering the levels of corruption of the country and creating solutions to mitigate economic instability.  Ruben Altman, member of RootStock, an open-source smart contract platform, expressed his optimism that future blockchain initiatives would bring about real change.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The blockchain is useful if you want to build a society with different contract models than those that already exist today.""  There's also a sense that blockchain technology can be used more broadly, in areas like law, that would not have been impacted by money alone.  Altman added: ""You are very limited by what the law says in each country. With intelligent contracts, you can find more options. It will take you only 10 lines of code to write.""  Seeing value  But it remains early for the local industry.  Marco Carnut, a Brazilian who works at blockchain provider Tempest Security Intelligence, said that while most bitcoiners think the digital currency is headed ""to the moon"", it is really in its early stages of adoption.  He compared blockchain to the Internet – not a small thing to say, but it was echoed by others.  ""When the Internet began to exist many people did not understand what it was, few understood what the 'at symbol' was. The same is true today when we talk about bitcoin and blockchain…. People ask 'What is this?'"" he said.  Carnut agreed with Altman that Latin Americans understand what a shaky economy is like, and perhaps better understand bitcoin's value. This has led to confidence here that Latin America can help lead the revolution.  Augusto Lemble, a local student, said he thinks that startups based in Argentina could be more disruptive than those based abroad.  ""Maybe because we are much more familiar with economic problems that makes us adapt more quickly than others,"" he said.  Database applications  Just as important, though, may be navigating industry changes.  Another participant, Francisco Gómez Salaverri, co-founder of CrowdJury, said he believes that it is equally important that the community understands how blockchain can be used as a database.  The comments come as Latin American banks begin to show an interest in blockchain, joining groups like R3CEV.  ""We are able to transfer all kinds of files anonymously. We can see our transfers but at the same time safeguard our privacy,"" Salaverri said.  But CrowdJury's Juan Cruz Dimaio didn't see this as a change that would hurt blockchain's potential. He noted that issues with the government (in his startup's case, the judicial system), are also becoming the heart of many other local projects.  He concluded:  ""[The blockchain] ensures that the evidence that you upload will be there, with far less manipulation of what is currently happening in Argentina.""

42399457,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjDGe,1478612105,Trumpchain Revealed: The Man Behind the Blockchain Parody,"Social media is no stranger to bitcoin and blockchain parody accounts, but given the state of recent debates, none was perhaps a better industry barometer than Trumpchain.  A mysterious parody account that used the likeness of the presidential candidate (and his signature Twitter tactics), Trumpchain emerged this year as a short-lived Startup L Jackson for the blockchain industry, one ready to dispense wisdom on everything from bitcoin's block size debate to ethereum's hard fork with the candidate's usual bombast.  Trumpchain seemed to be at its best in Tweets that amplified the already outsized drama in the space, drawing comparisons between Iran's use of nuclear weapons with the hostility many have aimed at the big banks, and always ready to build a wall around whatever was unpopular.  Indeed, at points, even the tech-generated Tweets (often nonsensical word soups of terms) seemed to poke fun at the state of the industry's increasingly complex nomenclature.  But one complexity is now coming to a close, as CoinDesk can reveal that Trumpchain's curator is none other than former Square engineer and the newest employee for blockchain startup Chain, Tony Arcieri.  In interview, Arcieri said that, while notable for the blockchain Twitterarti, he feels the handle may have ultimately made a bigger point about the US election.  Arcieri told CoinDesk:  ""I think with the polarization, it definitely made something of a statement about that. In the tweets, he ended up having inconsistent views, like Trump himself.""  Arcieri noted also that he will be voting for Trump's rival, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton today, and that he is hoping for a Trump loss.  Asked whether he will shut down the account following the election, Arcieri was less clear, noting that, like many things, this may be determined by today's results.  Yet, if tomorrow does mark the end, it doesn't have to be goodbye forever.  CoinDesk has curated a few of our favorite tweets below:    It can happen. Our blockchain has tremendous potential.

42399467,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjDOW,1478606198,Bitcoin Traders Believe Trump Win Could Trigger Price Boost,"Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?  While America may be undecided, there's a widespread belief among bitcoin investors and analysts that a Trump presidency would provide a limited, but impactful, boost to bitcoin prices.  Such commentary follows on the heels of the UK's decision to leave the European Union in June, a development that many analysts credited with spurring uncertainty and causing a $100 increase in the price of bitcoin over just one trading session.  Analysts noted that while the digital currency markets might not see any significant change from Clinton's election, Trump could offer a marked contrast due to how his election is likely to impact global investors. Previously put forward by independent research, traders appear now to largely agree Trump would be a boon for bitcoin business.  Cryptocurrency hedge fund manager Jacob Eliosoff told CoinDesk:  ""I think a Trump presidency would be great for bitcoin, much like nuclear war would be great for bitcoin. It would be an epic disaster in a bunch of respects – economic, geopolitical, democratic – and in the fear and chaos bitcoin would be a defensive asset people could turn to.”  Elsewhere, analysts took a less alarming tone to the potential results, stating a Trump win could provide a small but notable boost for the digital currency.  If Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton wins, it will have “little or no"" effect on bitcoin prices, said another cryptocurrency hedge fund manager, Tim Enneking.  If anything, the digital currency might ""fall a bit,"" he said.  Certain political observers have predicted that if Clinton wins, her policy stances could result in her term largely being a continuation of President Obama's. Amid perceptions like these, many expect that her ascension to the Oval Office would come with limited uncertainty.  Others have suggested Clinton could be a boon for the public blockchain markets given her open embrace of the tech as part of her innovation platform. However, her policy to all parts of the ecosystem, including bitcoin, arguably aren't yet clear.  The Trump effect  While Trump hasn't put the digital currency on his agenda, he has cast himself as a Washington outsider, something that traders believe could stoke uncertainty (and with it a move toward alternative assets).  This could create only a temporary jump in bitcoin prices, predicted Enneking, but he suggested it would have little lasting effect.  ""[Trump] would certainly increase uncertainty domestically and, to some extent, globally, and that would provide a short-term, upward push to bitcoin prices,"" he said.  Petar Zivkovski, director of operations for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, provided similar input, emphasizing the uncertainty that would surround a Trump victory would create a “short-lived” impact on bitcoin prices.  He added:  ""I don't see large institutions pouring smart money into bitcoin due to a potential Trump presidency.""  Even those who did not offer an opinion on which candidate would boost the markets were ready for increased trading.  Mark Lamb, CEO of UK-based Coinfloor, for instance, noted he expects increased volumes as a result of the US election.  Non-traditional assets  Still, there was a sense that any boost to bitcoin would further cement its status as one of the newer and more unconventional ""safe haven"" assets in times of financial crisis.  ARK Invest's Chris Burniske, for example, emphasized that bitcoin can prove helpful for those looking to diversify their portfolios in unpredictable times, and said the election could add evidence to this claim.  ""The way in which its price movement is uncorrelated from other capital market assets may be a desirable characteristic for many investors in the face of uncertainty,"" he said. ""Depending on how people feel about the election, they may choose to hedge themselves from the more traditional markets by using bitcoin.""  Bobby Lee, CEO of China-based bitcoin exchange BTCC, was less concerned about the election, asserting that bitcoin will enjoy adoption as a financial tool no matter the outcome.  Lee told CoinDesk:  ""Regardless of who wins the elections in November, an increasing number of people will invest in bitcoin because of its limited issuance, decentralized nature and immunity from the whims of economic planners.""
