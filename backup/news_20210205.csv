42422926,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qoRh,1612562881,Binance Suspends Deposits in Nigeria Following Central Bank Directive,"Binance has temporarily suspended deposits in Nigerian naira – the country’s local fiat currency – in response to a Friday letter from Nigeria’s central bank (CBN) instructing local banks to identify and close all accounts tied to cryptocurrency platforms or operations.  The CBN letter told local banking institutions that dealing in cryptocurrencies or facilitating payments for cryptocurrency exchanges is prohibited under a 2017 circular stating bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies are not legal tender in the country. While the move might impact fiat on- and off-ramps, most of the nation’s crypto trading occurs on peer-to-peer platforms and remains unaffected, according to sources in Nigeria.  In a statement, Binance announced its Nigerian naira payment partners suspended deposit services until further notice, starting from 7 p.m. local time (GMT+1) as of Friday, adding that it is monitoring the situation closely.  “Withdrawal services remain normal and will continue to be processed but might take slightly longer time than usual,” the statement said.  Central bank ban  The CBN directive comes just months after protesters in Nigeria used bitcoin to raise funds after authorities reportedly shuttered bank accounts associated with the movement.  Since the letter started making rounds on the internet, Nigerian crypto users tweeted the hashtag #WeWantOurCryptoBack over 26,000 times, according to data obtained from SproutSocial.  But professionals in the crypto space do not believe the panic will last, or it will have any impact on crypto adoption.  Nigeria-based software and blockchain engineer Tosin Olugbenga told CoinDesk the CBN may have issued the directive because of the bitcoin price run of 2020 and growing interest in cryptocurrencies worldwide is causing Nigerians to convert their earnings to crypto.  “They’re moving money from naira to crypto. That is what the CBN sees and has taken issue with. It is not banning crypto trading. It’s just telling financial institutions not to allow their platforms to be used to buy or sell crypto on exchanges like binance,” Olugbenga said.  Olugbenga added that most crypto transactions in Nigeria happen on peer-to-peer exchanges, so once the panic dies down trading will continue as usual.  “The news has caused a panic in the crypto space, especially for new crypto investors, but the true essence of crypto is decentralization. [The] majority of crypto trades that occur in Nigeria are peer-to-peer,” Aronu Ugochukwu, chief executive officer of DeFi platform Xend Finance, told CoinDesk via an email.  So far, the CBN has not provided an official reason for the sudden order that is sending panic through social media.  Nigeria is the latest government to take an interest in regulating the space: India is once again considering a ban on private cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, said bitcoin facilitates questionable transactions and should be regulated on a global scale.

42433508,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOz4Nh,1612562116,"If Whales Move the Market, UniWhales Is the Whale Whisperer","When Elon Musk changed his Twitter bio to ""#bitcoin"" last week it moved the market, but not just for bitcoin itself.      Users of UniWhales could see big holders making moves in real time. Matt Aaron, the CEO of UniWhales, sent CoinDesk screenshots showing three big moves of liquidity providers exiting USDC/ETH and USDT/ETH positions on Uniswap. In 11 minutes, $47 million worth of liquidity had exited the Uniswap system right after Musk told the world:      ""Our thesis is that whales control the market,"" Aaron told CoinDesk in a phone call. ""People with more money tend to have better information.""      UniWhales started in September as a simple Telegram channel with a bot that flagged large buys on Uniswap. That's why it's called UniWhales. It started analyzing the moves of big holders (whales) on Uniswap, the leading automated market maker on Ethereum.      Santiago Roel of ParaFi Capital told CoinDesk via email that he has been using the product for a while.      ""Their subscription model offers a glimpse into how SaaS could be brought on chain, which will be an emerging theme as a new monetization model,"" he wrote.      Initiated by a pseudonymous developer called Timur, Aaron, a crypto alum, was an early adopter. ""I was addicted to this channel, just like as a fan,"" he said.      The approach took off quickly and the two decided to turn it into a business together.    In a pickle    Liquidity moves are telling but it all started with big buys.      For example, on Jan. 26, the price of the Ethereum token PICKLE shot up 40% (from just under $11 to almost $14), and members of the UniWhales community watched it happen in real time.      The UniWhales Telegram bot was flagging $1.6 million worth of PICKLE getting picked up in a short span of time on Uniswap. That was 75% of the daily trade volume all at once. Spotting this kind of movement is the heart of what PICKLE is all about.      Traders need alerts to know if something big is happening with a token they have a position in or if it means they should take a position. Some traders will simply follow momentum but others use UniWhales as an alert to see if they need to start looking at Twitter or Telegram to see what just happened.      Correlation is not causation, but Aaron showed CoinDesk a tweet that seemed to correspond nicely with the moves:      As ever, the name of Andre Cronje is powerful out there among the decentralized finance (DeFi) degens. The news that Yearn's founder had finalized his plan to make those who got the short end of the stick in the exploit somewhat whole was bullish, for at least some bag holders.      Pickle started as a publicly minded Weird DeFi project aimed at helping stablecoins hold their peg. Before long, the anon-led endeavor evolved into something like an imitation of Yearn Finance, the leading robo-adviser for yield. Like other anon-led projects before it, Pickle got exploited.      Yearn, in turn, absorbed it, in its quest to be the powerhouse of decentralized finance.      Eventually Timur and Aaron developed the UWL token, which enables access to the app, exclusive webinars and to premium Telegram channels. Like any startup, UniWhales is still working on its business model, but its focus is on building a strong analytics community for DeFi.    How it works    UniWhales describes itself as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) but only in the loosest sense.      By holding UWL, users can express their opinions to Aaron and Timur about what's needed.      ""We are definitely benevolent dictators,"" Aaron said, though he noted they have an ""open dialogue with everyone in their community.""      If, for example, they ever have any doubt about which direction to go, they have a gang in Telegram 16 hours a day that always has an opinion on any particular direction.      To access the community's private channels, a user needs to hold 5,000 UWL. UniWhales uses Mintgate and CollabLand to verify token holdings and allow premium access.      The basic membership provides access to the app and channels with bots that flag things like big buys on Uniswap or SushiSwap, new or unknown tokens and (like in the example up top) big moves into or out of liquidity pools.      For 16,000 UWL, users get access to the power channel, which shows moves by wallets known to be tied to major players in crypto, such as big funds or well-known investors.      The total supply is 10 million UWL. Of that, 35% was sold in a public and private sale and 25% was set aside for the liquidity supply. The sales happened in November and the team raised a total of 400 ETH.      All the funds were put into liquidity pools on automated market makers, and those LP tokens were locked up for six months. The team allocation of 15% is also locked up for six months.      Aaron said that's to ""signal to the community that we are trying to build it for the long term.""      Right now, the only recurring revenue the team has are the underlying LP fees on Uniswap and SushiSwap and any liquidity mining benefit either might proffer. Aaron said they are looking into other ways they might make the project more sustainable, though if fees get introduced anywhere he said they will accrue value to all token holders, not just the company.      ""We want to make sure the token holders are rewarded for participating in our project,"" Aaron said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | UNI | YFI,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/05/if-whales-move-the-market-uniwhales-is-the-whale-whisperer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/63061ee66ec2c2bc39e7e4fd559c2fc1146f80fb-1500x996.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $37,751 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 0.32% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $36,637-$38,332 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC below the 10-hour but above the 50-hour moving average on the hourly chart, a sideways signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin is now in the fourth day of an upward trend, going as high as $38,332 at 14:00 UTC (9 a.m. ET) before losing some steam heading into the weekend. It was down to $37,751 as of press time.      “Similar to the last bull run, we are seeing bitcoin initially steal the attention as retail adoption pours in through mainstream attention,” said Michael Gord, chief executive officer for trading firm Global Digital Asset.      However, Gord told CoinDesk traders are rotating out of bitcoin to high-flying digital assets. “Bitcoin then cools off and profits generated from bitcoin find themselves first in ether, then in other high market-cap digital assets,” Gord said.      Read More: Dalio to Offer Alt-Cash Fund, Says ‘Bitcoin Won’t Escape Our Scrutiny’      Nevertheless, fresh interest such as from Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates, which manages $150 billion in investor money, has some including quantitative trading firm QCP Capital highly bullish on bitcoin.      “Bridgewater’s piece out last week had a sensitivity analysis which showed their estimates of BTC price, should private holders of gold switch to BTC,” states QCP’s weekly investor note Friday. “They forecasted that should 50% of capital in gold move into BTC, that would result in a price of $85,000 per 1 BTC.”      Investors are certainly looking to crypto as an asset class, but bitcoin is still quite volatile; its 30-day volatility from Thursday’s close is at 102.9% on an annualized basis whereas gold is at 16%.      Yet, crypto advocates see bitcoin and ether (ETH) similar to different asset classes, according to Joel Edgerton, chief operating officer of cryptocurrency exchange BitFlyer USA. “My guess is that BTC is like gold and priced by the value it stores, a scarce commodity in price discovery,” Edgerton said. “ETH is more like a stock and priced by the value it delivers (ETH 2.0, network effects, basis for DeFi)."" He said he thinks of ether as an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for decentralized finance.      While bitcoin has performed well so far in 2021 – it’s up 29% – ether’s returns have more than quadrupled, gaining 129%.      “Ether is surging largely on the back of the growth in decentralized finance projects that rely on ERC-20 tokens to operate,” Guy Hirsch, managing director of U.S. for eToro. “Since ETH has not previously traded this high, it’s hard to tell what kind of support there is but, should DeFi projects continue to grow at the rate they are, it would be hard for ETH to not also continue setting new records.”      One thing to watch during a heated ether market is the ETH/BTC trading pair. A rise in this market signals traders are selling their bitcoin for ether; it has appreciated over 75% in 2021.      “While bitcoin consolidates and trends back towards all-time highs, much of the price action has focused on the ETH and DeFi space,” said Jason Lau, chief operating officer of San Francisco-based crypto exchange OKCoin. “ETH/BTC has almost doubled in the last month.”    Ether dominance up ahead of CME launch    Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Friday, trading around $1,714 and climbing 3.3% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET). It hit a brand-new price high Friday, at $1,761, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      Read More: Ether Tops $1.7K, Setting New Record as CME Futures Launch Nears      The dominance of ether, a measure of the asset to the larger $1.1 trillion market cap of cryptocurrencies overall, is now at over 17%. That’s a more than 50% increase since the beginning of 2021, according to metrics calculated by charting software TradingView.      Chad Steinglass, head of trading at CrossTower Capital, told CoinDesk that crypto traders have been scooping up ETH ahead of institutional-friendly CME launching ether futures Feb. 8. “I think that many traders are building positions ahead of the launch,” he said.      “The availability of CME-listed ETH futures could be a significant positive catalyst,” said Steinglass. “The addition of CME futures will open the door to many potential investors who want to have exposure, but have yet to take any positions due to logistical hurdles.”      “With decentralized exchange trading surging yet again, and yield farming showing no sign of easing, growing interest in leveraged farming products is driving demand for ETH ever so higher and shows the market is only going to grow further,” noted Denis Vinokourov, head of research at crypto brokerage Bequant.

The final payment was made in January and the line of credit opened by Tether back in 2018 has been cancelled, according to Bitfinex’s website.      As of April 30, 2019, the USDT stablecoin was only about 74% backed by fiat equivalents, according to Tether’s general counsel, Stuart Hoegner, because of the loan and a credit line Tether opened for Bitfinex to cover the lost funds. Hoegner is also the general counsel to Bitfinex.      But Tether’s Bahamas-based bank, Deltec, said late last month that the tether stablecoin is fully backed by reserves and the reserve “is more than what is in circulation.” The bank has not produced an attestation or audit from a neutral third part auditor to verify the claim.

42385927,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOxnX,1612557862,Why a Chinese New Year Sell-Off May Not Happen This Year,"The lunar Chinese New Year this year is on Feb. 12, right around the corner. But unlike in previous years, some analysts and traders say the “Chinese New Year Dump,” a belief bitcoin’s (BTC) price would drop around the holiday period, will not take place this year. Why? The impact of retail traders in China has been reduced.      Some argue the “Chinese New Year dump” will not happen this year because institutional investors in the U.S. and Europe have been the main drivers of the current bull run. That is in contrast to 2017’s bull market, which was heavily powered by retail investors in Asia.      Meanwhile, many on Chinese-language social media platforms are discussing whether the current bitcoin bull market would be forced to pause during the holiday season.      Concern about the Chinese New Year’s effect is compounded by data showing at least a handful of miners in China sold their bitcoin in January. Some speculate the selling was triggered by bearish sentiment ahead of the new year.    Cash is king, especially during holiday season    “Chinese traders tend to withdraw their crypto assets and cash out,” Alex Zuo, vice president of China-based crypto wallet Cobo, told CoinDesk. “It is just like how people in the U.S. would take profit from stock holdings before Christmas.”      “There’s a decades-old tradition of giving out money, or ‘red packets,’ to family and friends and special people of interest [in China] during Chinese new year,” explained Felix Wang, managing director and partner of investment research firm Hedgeye Risk’s China business. “They need cash so they need to liquidate some of their financial holdings, and that could lead to a little bit of pressure in some of the financial markets.”      Liquidity is another concern. Most businesses are closed during the week of the Chinese New Year, including over-the-counter service and crypto trading desks because people in the Greater China region take at least five days off to reunite with their families and celebrate the holiday.      Data compiled by CoinDesk Research shows the trading volumes on Binance, Huobi and OKEx – the most popular crypto exchanges catering to customers in China – were down during the Chinese New Year period in the past two years. The same decreased trading volumes also appeared during the month October each year, when the Golden Holiday in China takes place.      Decreased liquidity and increased withdrawal activities exposed the market to higher price volatility risks. Trading data from TradingView on Binance’s bitcoin/USDT (tether) pair shows that in each of the past three years, bitcoin’s price went down before the Chinese New Year.      By examining the 14-day price movement up to the day of Chinese New Year over the past three years, per CoinDesk’s BPI data, bitcoin’s price fell as people started taking days off to prepare for the holiday. In 2018, bitcoin’s price dropped to $5,947.40, down 37.2% from a high point at $9,471.46 during the 14-day period. In 2019, for the same period, bitcoin’s price fell to $3,346.14, down 8.3% from an earlier high at $3,648.50. For 2020, the drop was 10.5%, from $9,181.97 to $8,220.87.    Why 2021 might be different    As fate would have it, the year of 2021 will be the year of the ox on the Chinese lunar calendar, a bullish omen. While some may have sold their bitcoin, a large number of traders and investors in China, betting on a long-lasting positive market trend, appear to be holding their BTC into the new year.      Cynthia Wu, head of business development and sales at Hong Kong-based crypto trading service firm Matrixport, told CoinDesk she has not noticed any significant uptick in bitcoin selling from her company’s miner clients, other than a minor increase as the holidays approach.      Mining companies ""need to pay annual bonuses to their employees"" around Chinese New Year, Wu said. “It is just simply a seasonal behavior.”      Lei Tong, managing director of financial services at Hong Kong-based crypto lender Babel, told CoinDesk the company has been paid back by few China mining companies, an indication these miners have not sold a large amount of their bitcoin holdings yet. Babel allows bitcoin mining firms to use their machines as loan collateral, as CoinDesk reported previously.      At crypto exchange OKEx, Robbie Liu, market analyst at OKEx’s research arm OKEx Insights, told CoinDesk there have been no “unusual fluctuations'' in the exchange's USDT/Chinese yuan rate recently, and there have not been any liquidity problems this year so far.      As of press time, Binance and Huobi have not responded to CoinDesk’s requests for comments.      “This year’s market has been very different from the past years’ and we are seeing very limited impact from [Chinese] retail traders’ behaviors"" such as cashing out, mining pool F2Pool’s co-founder, Shixing “Discus Fish"" Mao, told CoinDesk. “The current market is driven by institutional money and it moves with the emotions of these Western institutions. We cannot simply come to any conclusions on [bitcoin’s] price’s trend based on retailers’ behaviors.”    An added factor: China’s crackdown on OTC desks    China’s crackdown on the over-the-counter (OTC) service is another potential reason fewer people are cashing out ahead of New Year's, said people who are familiar with the matter.      As CoinDesk reported previously, Chinese crypto investors using OTC merchants have faced challenges liquidating their crypto holdings for cash because Chinese police have been freezing OTC-related bank accounts and cards amid the Chinese government’s crackdown on money laundering via cryptocurrencies.      Unregulated digital currency outflows, worth a total of $17.5 billion in 2020, were up 51% from 2019, according to an anti-money laundering report published on Feb. 5 by China-based blockchain analysis firm PeckShield.      A representative from PeckShield told CoinDesk that some crypto users on major crypto exchanges could have found their bank accounts frozen because their OTC transactions may have accidentally participated in money laundering activities without realizing it.      “These accounts were ‘contaminated’ and, therefore, they were eventually temporarily frozen by the Chinese authorities,” the representative said.      The crackdown on OTC-related money laundering activities and so-called “card freeze” action have continued into 2021, according to PeckShield. China’s central bank and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange issued a new notice recently to further guide banks on how to operate their cross-border businesses, tightening the clampdown on money laundering and terrorist financing.      Notebly, at least one key Huobi executive is still in custody in China due to investigations related to Huobi’s OTC trading business.      “It was so easy to sell your cryptocurrencies via OTC desks and change them to Chinese yuan immediately,” said a source to CoinDesk, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. “It’s highly likely to have your bank accounts frozen this year when the transactions involve those OTC merchants.”    COVID-19 remains a wild card    Even though the coronavirus pandemic is being treated as if it were well under control in China compared with most Western countries, a new number of cases in the past month has led the Chinese government to put more restrictions on traveling around the holiday time in the country.      Some say the uncertainty around the COVID-19 restrictions during the holiday season could have an impact on the crypto market.      Hedgeye’s Wang, whose research work concentrates on the Chinese equities markets, sees new and strong retail interest in Chinese financial market since December due to an eagerness to invest in China and a “flurry” of IPOs from Chinese companies.      Data from a December report by the China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation shows there are more than 1.6 million newly registered individual stock investors in China in December alone, nearly double the number of the previous year.      Because people cannot travel and the stock market is closed during the holiday week, according to Wang, there could be some negative impact on the crypto market.      Wang notes an that stock market prices Chinese mainland-based stock exchanges have been found to move in the opposite direction of Macau’s gambling revenues and visitation.      “Sometimes there's an inverse correlation [between stock price and Macau’s casino business],” Wang said. “Because if you can’t bet on the stock market, you go gamble your money in casinos.”      One possible sign of things to come may have been what just happened in the U.S., where retail stock traders rushed to crypto when they were frustrated by the restrictions on their stock buying on online platforms such as Robinhood.      Whether that means more people in China may turn to crypto trading during the holiday season remains unclear.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/05/why-a-chinese-new-year-sell-off-may-not-happen-this-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2d97fa1a39584f235331e964fe30e088c07f8bd4-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385918,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOxdT,1612553854,Fundamental Investing Is Alive and Well in Crypto,"Following the recent moves in GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC) stocks, and DOGE and XRP tokens, investors across the globe are rightfully questioning fundamental investment analysis. While cryptocurrencies are often heralded as a gambler’s playground, the irony is that digital assets might be one of the few asset classes left for true fundamental investment analysis.    Jeff Dorman, a CoinDesk columnist, is chief investment officer at Arca, where he leads the investment committee and is responsible for portfolio sizing and risk management.    Ideas are a dime a dozen. What separates good investments from bad investments is how you express those ideas to maximize upside and minimize downside. For example, in 2011-2012, many very smart investors looked for ways to express the same idea: that there was going to be a double-dip recession and inflation was going to be rampant after unprecedented monetary policy interjections (of course, the 2009 stimulus was child’s play compared to the reckless government spending today, but 10 years ago, stimulus was a big deal).      What tools did most investors use to express this view?    Shorting U.S. equities (into a 10-year bull run)  Shorting Spanish, Italian and Greek government bonds (yields are now at or below 0% after the European Central Bank essentially nationalized these countries’ debts over the past decade)  Buying gold (which traded straight down and then sideways for seven years before catching a renewed bid post-COVID)  Moving teams of distressed analysts to Europe to buy European bank debt that should in theory be offered by these distressed banks at pennies on the dollar (this didn’t work, as the banks simply kept this debt at par value on their balance sheet, and never ended up selling)    As you can probably imagine, none of these investments worked, even though the idea was sound. In fact, one of the best investments to take advantage of the monetary policy and recession theme turned out to be buying bitcoin. Unfortunately for most investors, this instrument wasn’t in their playbook yet.      Most uninformed investors still believe all digital assets are a copycat version of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency, but the reality is today’s digital assets investable universe is very diverse, unique and idiosyncratic. As such, the playbook has expanded, and so have the investable themes that an investor can express. For example, if you wanted to express that the Coinbase initial public offering (IPO) is going to go up 100% upon listing, there are a variety of ways in which you can express that view:    Buy private Coinbase shares in the secondary market  Buy shares of similar publicly traded companies (Galaxy, Voyageur, etc.) which should benefit from relative value  Buy tokens of other exchanges (BNB, FTT, VGX, etc.) which should reprice after the Coinbase S-1 gives details as to how the company generates revenue  Buy bitcoin or ethereum as a market proxy to represent renewed interest in digital assets.    Not all of these investments will necessarily work. But the point is, coming up with the idea itself is less important than finding the best way to express that view. Paul Tudor Jones’ bitcoin investment thesis back in 2Q 2020 is a good example of this thought process, as it wasn’t a bitcoin investment thesis at all. It was an inflation thesis. Bitcoin was just one of four ways Tudor chose to express this view (the others being a) long the Nasdaq 100, b) long gold and c) buying a 2s/10s Treasury steepener.      Another good example is the recent MicroStrategy (MSTR) convertible bond offering. Given a high cash balance and no other debt in the capital structure, this bond has a very low likelihood of default or impairment. If you bought this convertible note at par, you were effectively being paid 0.75% per year in interest to own a long-dated bitcoin call option. If you were bullish on bitcoin, this was a very cheap and low risk way to express that view.      At Arca, we do fundamental research on the digital assets space. That means, we create an overall top-down view of higher-level theses and macro themes that should create long-term growth, then canvass the universe for investable assets that best express these views and then do a bottoms-up analysis on each individual token, stock or bond to ensure that it will accrue value if we are right.      See also: Jeff Dorman - What This Digital Asset Investment Firm Missed and Capitalized On in 2020      Each investment will have different risk/reward setups, different timeframes to measure success/failure and different total return outcomes. An investment that has just 10% upside but carries only 2% downside may be a better investment from a risk/reward standpoint than an investment that has 1000% upside but also carries 50% of downside risk. The goal is to find the most upside potential per unit of potential downside risk.      While perhaps surprising to many, digital assets offer a variety of ways to structure these investment setups, where fundamental analysis can be used to estimate both downside floors and upside potential. The digital assets ecosystem has evolved into a complex asset class and has become perhaps the perfect asset class for fundamental analysis and low-risk, high-reward investing. In addition to simply finding growth assets, there are now great risk/reward setups that often materialize organically. For example:    Are you interested in expressing a view on the growth of digital assets?    If so, there are protocols that are growing volumes and revenues over 100% quarter over quarter, while also spitting off hundreds of millions of dollars of free cash flow. Uniswap (UNI) and Sushiswap (SUSHI) are the clear market leaders in decentralized exchange (DEX) trading, with annualized revenues of over $500 million and $200mm, respectively. While the UNI and SUSHI tokens have uncertain fates in terms of how value from these cash flows will accrue to the tokens, you can still make a strong fundamental argument. For example, the price-to-sales ratio based on forward revenues is under 5x, which is incredibly cheap relative to equity prices of traditional exchanges, which trade on average between 10-20x, and don’t have the same exponential growth potential. It’s not often that you can invest in a blue chip growth asset that is also a value asset at the same time.    Are you interested in buying ethereum with a very cheap perpetual call option on the growth of DeFi attached?    Because that’s exactly what the wrapped nexus mutual (WNXM) token offers. The NXM token is an asset-backed token, backed by the ETH in the capital pool that is used to pay out potential insurance claims. Based on the amount of ETH currently in the capital pool, the net market cap of nexus mutual (in excess of the assets backing it) is only $43 million, and WNXM trades at only 1.2x book value, even though nexus mutual is a cash flow producing entity with very strong growth metrics. Comparable insurance companies in the public equity market trade at 2-5x book value, with high-growth companies like Lemonade and Root trading closer to 50x book value. At one point, you could even have owned WNXM below book value! Owning WNXM is one cheap way to invest in the growth of the Ethereum blockchain and DeFi.    Would you be interested in buying bitcoin at a 47% discount to current trading levels?    While this one has a lot more hair on it and it will take longer to extract the value, buying EOS might be the cheapest way to buy bitcoin right now. The company behind EOS has at least 140,000 BTC ($5 billion) on its balance sheet, while EOS trades at under $3 billion in market cap. This means buying EOS is like buying bitcoin at a 47% discount if you’re able to extract this value.      The list goes on and on but the point is fundamental investment analysis can and is being utilized in this growing asset class. Cash-flow analysis and book value analysis are just a few tools we use to analyze and value these instruments. Much like fixed income, every digital asset is unique and has different properties and attributes that create value. Our job as fundamental analysts is to find and extract this value, and to do so in the least risky way possible. In our view, finding upside is not nearly as important as limiting the expected downside.      See also: Jeff Dorman - Digital Assets Are More Recession-Proof Than You Might Think      We often find that today’s digital assets investors are impatient or have a singular view. In a world of common 50%-100% weekly returns, many want and expect immediate results and gratification. Therefore, anything that doesn’t go up right away must be wrong or must carry too high of an opportunity cost to warrant an investment. We find that to be very short-sighted. Every investor, and every investment, has a different mandate and certain investment setups fit different buckets. We approach investing in digital assets from a value lens, and we believe there is a lot of value in this space when you look beyond charts and volatility.

42385919,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOxhF,1612553322,Corporate Treasuries Are Figuring Out Bitcoin on the Balance Sheet,"Digital assets, in one form or another, are making their way into big business.      The headline-grabbing version of this is straight-up BTC on the balance sheet, a renegade charge being led by MicroStrategy (MSYTR) CEO Michael Saylor, who is known for warning corporates that capital in fiat is being debased.      Saylor’s MicroStrategy event this week included a playbook, going into the nuts and bolts of things like qualified custodians, hot and cold wallets and so on. Square (SQ) provided a similar guide in October.      It’s worth stepping back and remembering what unlikely bedfellows mainstream corporate treasury management and bitcoin really are – and how unthinkable this would have been a couple of years back.      That said, MicroStrategy is not alone when it comes to fielding these sorts of discussions. At the end of last month, an event hosted by the Association of Corporate Treasurers (ACT) featured London-based crypto custodian Copper in discussion with IKEA’s treasury group.      It’s a conversation corporate treasurers should be having, said Naresh Aggarwal, associate director at the ACT, even if the reality of getting into this new asset class remains some way off for many.      “Through experience and from our qualifications, most treasurers are familiar with applying security, liquidity and yield when it comes to investing. In that order,” Aggarwal told CoinDesk in an interview. “Ultimately, if a board decides it wants to ride the coat-tails of a market that is potentially continuing to go up, that's a choice that should be based on the risk appetite of the company – informed, of course, by their treasurer.”    Read more: Saylor, MicroStrategy Offer Playbook for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption at Annual Summit    Aggarwal agreed the discussion around whether crypto is a hedge against inflation is an interesting one, but pointed out that countries like the U.K. are not running into an inflationary environment.      “Most G20 countries are not experiencing high levels of inflation and in the U.K., I think inflation recently ticked up to 0.8%,” Aggarwal said. “I can't see us returning to the days of inflation rates of 8% or 9% any time soon. If you're in Venezuela, for example, then that's a very different situation.”      While corporate treasurers wait and see what happens to Saylor’s capital reserves, many players understand the inevitability of digital and crypto-enhanced forms of payment and tokenized asset plays. Last year’s regulatory recommendations from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) only served to confirm this.    Ledgermatic for the people    Making its first immaculately timed outing this week, Ledgermatic, a startup helmed by former PwC, IBM and BTC.com executives, is offering a range of tools to future-proof corporate treasury management in light of the coming digital-asset economy.      Ledgermatic CEO Luke Sully says the likes of Michael Saylor and Jack Dorsey must be recognized as the first corporate evangelists for this use case.      “This will be an interesting test case for the BTC on the balance sheet,” Sully said in an interview. “It would appear that theirs are a long-term approach and not for short-term gains. I expect CFOs and treasury teams will be watching and scratching their heads, thinking of the other questions this raises and exactly how to manage this particular asset and get the benefit while reducing exposure to its price volatility.”    Read more: Square Puts 1% of Total Assets in Bitcoin in Surprise $50M Investment    Corporates have to account for crypto differently than investment funds do, Sully pointed out, adding that most CFOs and finance teams just don't have the tools available to them to manage and integrate digital-asset workflows.      “There are some procedures we have gamed out for anyone thinking of adding crypto to their balance sheet,” he said.      It’s also worth remembering that Square is a payments company that is naturally involved in fintech, while software is native to MicroStrategy. Even some insurance companies that are said to be looking at crypto, may well have been through a process of tire-kicking with custody providers that are looking for cover.      Speaking at the Copper/ACT webinar, Michael Aandahl, IKEA Group’s head of digital treasury, said the “early birds” moving towards digital assets are often already close to this area in terms of their core business.      “You can imagine, as you get further away from your core business, you would ask more questions like, ‘Should we really be doing this?’” Aandahl said. “Well, I think the point here is some companies are starting to do this because they see it as an enabler for their core business.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/02/05/corporate-treasuries-are-figuring-out-bitcoin-on-the-balance-sheet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8dbc7104935fb2697007f0983697e6d2b6611ade-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42385920,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOxej,1612549293,"Hackers Are Trying to Mine Crypto Using Russian Government Servers, Expert Says","Hackers are increasingly attacking Russia's government IT infrastructure to mine crypto, a law enforcement-affiliated expert said in a conference on Thursday.      According to Nikolai Murashov, deputy director of the National Coordination Center for Computer Incidents, hackers have been actively exploiting the IT infrastructure of Russia's government bodies, defense contractors, medical entities and research institutes to mine cryptocurrencies. He said this during his speech at the Infoforum conference in Moscow, though he didn't provide specific details about these attacks, the TASS news agency reported.      At the same time, researchers at the Group-IB cybersecurity firm say that crypto mining is actually one of the least popular ways for hackers to raise funds, both globally and in Russia in particular. According to Group-IB's ""Hi-Tech Crime Trends 2020–2021"" report, published past November, the main cybersecurity threat for companies is encrypting malware.      ""Even those hacker groups that previously attacked banks to pull money out via card processing, ATMs and SWIFT are now using encrypting malware,"" Group-IB spokesperson Pavel Sedakov told CoinDesk. Demanding a big chunk of money right away appears to be a more attractive tactic than waiting until the mining software accumulates enough crypto, he said. Plus, now the attackers are demanding that a victims pays twice: both for decrypting the data and for not publishing it online.      Sometimes, governments employees themselves abuse access to computers at work to mine crypto. In December 2019, Murashov said two Russian nationals were prosecuted for using the government IT infrastructure, including a municipal water utility company, for mining. Also in 2019, several employees of the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics in Sarov were sentenced to fines and prison time for mining on computers in a nuclear research lab.

42385922,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOxjl,1612546776,Blockchain Bites: The Weird and Wonderful in Crypto This Week,"Three stories    The big news of today, in context.      1. The crypto-bank connection is strengthening. Seattle-based Protego Trust Bank has received conditional approval for a trust charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to custody digital assets.    Protego is the second applicant to receive conditional approval from the OCC following Anchorage. It follows several other digital asset companies that have received bank charters, including crypto exchange Kraken and Avanti, which both received state charters in Wyoming.  Meanwhile, crypto payments platform Metal Pay has filed to become a national bank in the U.S. CEO Marshal Hayner told CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson the start-up seeks “full” banking licensure, including for cash deposits that would be insured by the FDIC.    2. Ethereum is pumping. The crypto surged past $1,700, notching gains of at least 30% this week. Analysts are pointing to ETH’s coming futures listing on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, due to start Feb. 8.    “Ether’s recent rally looks similar to bitcoin‘s (BTC) staggering rise from nearly $6,200 to $19,783 seen in weeks leading up to the CME futures launch on Dec. 17, 2017,” CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole notes. “The bull market ended following the futures launch and prices fell as low as $3,200 by December 2018.”  A rally is happening across plenty of assets that rely on Ethereum’s base infrastructure, including so-called DeFi tokens. In the past 24 hours, DeFi-linked coins such as COMP, AAVE, KNC and ZRX have all leapt to fresh lifetime highs, Godbole reports.    3. In a reminder of the power regulators can wield, Nigeria’s central bank has ordered banks to close any accounts found to have a history of ""dealing in cryptocurrencies or facilitating payments for cryptocurrency exchanges.”    The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has ordered banks in the country to ""identify persons and/or entities"" transacting with cryptocurrency or operating crypto exchanges on their platforms and ""ensure that such accounts are closed immediately.""  India, too, is exploring a strict regulatory framework to handle digital assets, while the U.S. Treasury’s own controversial rule – while not an outright ban, it would change the face of the industry – is still snaking its way through the system.  At stake  The weird and wonderful in crypto today    Here’s a roundup of all the stories from the strange world of crypto and blockchain that didn’t find a home in Blockchain Bites this week.      Bitcoin billionaire and former presidential candidate Brock Pierce is looking to convert a defunct New York City church into a 21st-century rental residence. The New York Post reports Pierce is also transforming a 17th-century former Puerto Rican monastery into a private club.      “It’s the oldest monastery in the Americas,” Pierce reportedly said.      German authorities “seized” a wallet containing over 1,700 bitcoin (~$64.7 million), but can’t access it. The funds came from a convicted hacker who refuses to share the password.      “We asked him but he didn’t say,” prosecutor Sebastian Murer told Reuters. “Perhaps he doesn’t know.”      Maybe they should call “Dave Bitcoin,” a modern-day repair man who helps people access password-protected wallets when they have forgotten the password. Wallet Recovery Services, Dave’s business, is booming in the bull run.      “These days, because of the price rise and just the increased interest, we get around 50 to 70 requests daily,” he told CoinDesk’s Ben Powers. (The decoders take 20% off the top, if resuscitation is possible.)      With all that bitcoin trapped in unmovable addresses and garbage pits, Coin Metrics finally offers a new accounting of the real circulating BTC supply. TL;DR: A good estimate for bitcoin float is 14.5 million, (meaning about 4 million BTC have been lost to the sands of time.)      All this for what Australia’s central bank said is “not even really money.” Speaking to a legislative committee, Reserve Bank of Australia Assistant Governor Michelle Bullock mocked the “fuss” made around bitcoin (and stablecoins) as an asset.      “[Bitcoin] is a risk to investors but it's not a financial stability risk,” Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe echoed.      The risks are real enough for a Malaysian pair of alleged scammers, who might be canned under state law, for reportedly defrauding three women of more than 150,000 Malaysian ringgits (around $37,000). They also face fines and jail time, if convicted.      It’s not just novel punishments, but the scams themselves that are evolving in this bull market. Industry publication Protos notes that were once scammers would pretend to be Elon Musk, they are now impersonating Social Capital’s Chamath Palihapitiya, among other tech influencers.      One Palihapitiya scam raised approximately $60,000 in 16 transactions, when they went to press. It looks like the scam is still up.      In the worst segue in this series yet, Vanity Fair profiled BitMEX founder and outspoken bitcoin bull Arthur Hayes, who remains at large after the U.S. government levied crimes against him for… well… it’s a little complicated, but it involves something that looks like fraud. The more you dig in, the odder the story appears.      “‘You can look at the history of anti-money-laundering prosecutions over the last 10 years, and you just aren’t going to see very many individual defendants named,” attorney and crypto expert [Laurel Loomis Rimon] expounded. ""Certainly not when you’re talking about program violations as opposed to evidence of actual money laundering. So that is unusual.’”      Hayes is known for his expensive tastes. And now, thanks to Swiss-regulated digital asset firm Sygnum, he can be sure he’s popping the right cork. Sygnum Bank teamed up with Fine Wine Capital AG to tokenize a range of “investible fine wines,” issuing tokens representing the alcoholic assets on a distributed ledger.      Elsewhere in the world of tokens, Jehan Chu, a Hong Kong-based crypto investor, reportedly bought “.nft” (a top level domain, like .com or .xyz) from decentralized naming service Handshake for the low, low price of 680,000 HNS tokens (about $84,000), Decrypt covered. Handshake lets anyone auction essentially any domain, including those made out of emojis.      Memes mean money, Michael Casey once wrote. Indeed, “a demonic digital artwork on the Ethereum blockchain” sold for 420 ETH on Wednesday. The digital painting – which the buyer compared to a Basquiat – was part of the Hashmask collection of 16,384 non-fungible tokens created by about 70 artists.      “Knowing that I’m an early investor while also providing liquidity to artists and projects is incredibly rewarding,” the buyer told CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair.      One dogecoin address apparently holds 27% of the entire coin’s entire supply, Decrypt reports. With about 34.9 billion DOGE, this unknown person/persons crossed into billionaire territory in the latest pump. (Though perhaps, as Decrypt considers, perhaps the owner was already a well-known, meme-loving billionaire.) Hot dog!      One of “DeFi Summer’s” first memetic fascinations, Yearn, was “exploited” yesterday, draining some $11 million worth of tokens from one of the project’s “vaults.” The v1 DAI vault, a smart contract that performs an investment strategy for investors, was hit with what’s becoming a classic “flash loan” attack.      ""That's a well-known issue (one could have it with Uniswap, too, however, Uniswap is not so popular for yield farming),” Curve CEO Michael Egorov told CoinDesk’s Ethereum whisperers Brady Dale and Will Foxley. “I've expressed my thoughts to Yearn team how this could have been prevented (and similar vulnerabilities, too). But honestly, didn't expect them to have such a mistake in the code, that was a surprise to me.""      Obviously it’s not just crypto that’s susceptible to meme-driven mania. After whatever happened with GameStop, anything seems possible. Though, a GameStop-style, Reddit-driven anti-Wall Street rally is unlikely to happen in China, any time soon, CoinDesk’s David Pan reports.      “The Chinese financial regulators are closely monitoring who are trading what in the Chinese stock market. Retail investors involved in large-scale malicious shorting could be put in jail,” said Jason Wu, CEO of crypto-lending firm DeFiner.      Yes, regulators have a long tail of influence. Protos reports a cannabis stablecoin pilot has been “blessed” by the U.S. state of Nevada but is unlikely to fly high. Multichain Ventures pitched a Solana-based tokenized dollars scheme, with deposits reportedly sitting in a federal bank, finally allowing the cannabis industry to transact electronically. (Banks have been unwilling to touch the industry, meaning Navadans are strictly buying weed with cash.)      Seems like a libertarian fever dream, which as CoinDesk’s Brady Dale notes is the true foundation for what some see as a larger decentralization revolution. According to Dale’s sources, “the state” is still the final boss in terms of achieving freedom, with crypto serving as a convenient “cheat code.” A picture of the sovereign individual, according to author Robert Heinlein:      ""A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.""      Finally, Jack Dorsey has set up his own node. That’s right, the bearded executive of two publicly traded companies playing a hand in remaking media and finance has downloaded the open-source bitcoin codebase and hit play. Sovereignty in action.      Alright, thanks for reading. See ya next week.      Feel free to reach out with the weird and wonderful things in crypto at daniel@coindesk.com.

42385923,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBOxl1,1612546704,Money Reimagined: Enterprise Blockchain Isn't Dead,"Welcome to Money Reimagined.      A snowy week has left New Yorkers chilly. But ether investors must be feeling cosy. Ethereum’s native token has risen more than 25% on the week to clock new record highs and far outpace bitcoin’s gain, while Ethereum-centric decentralized finance (DeFi) data showed new records for total value locked in DeFi. The numbers speak volumes about the symbiotic relationship between DeFi and ether but also show how much pressure is on developers to execute on the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. The congested network is grappling with sky-high transaction fees (as I discuss below).      From the vibrant trading in ETH, DeFi tokens and other crypto assets to another wild market story: the WallStreetBets/GameStop episode that we (and pretty much every other media outlet in finance) has been obsessed with these past two weeks. The political, social, economic and technological fallout from that affair was the topic of conversation in this week’s “Money Reimagined” podcast. In it, Sheila Warren and I engage in an edgy, far-ranging conversation with “Hidden Forces” podcast host Demetri Kofinas that ties the WSB/GameStop phenomenon into everything from FDR to Occupy Wall Street to surveillance capitalism.      Don’t miss it. Oh, but read the newsletter below first.    Enterprise blockchain’s not dead. It just needs crypto    The headline for CoinDesk reporter Ian Allison’s big story this week highlighted a major failure for the most influential enterprise IT company in history: “IBM Blockchain Is a Shell of Its Former Self After Revenue Misses, Job Cuts.”      But there’s a bigger issue here than Big Blue’s struggle to turn blockchain advisory services into an engine for cloud service revenues. It’s that this story will be viewed by Bitcoin maximalists and crypto skeptics alike as proof that “enterprise blockchain” is dead. There are no viable business applications for blockchain technology, these people will tell you, beyond supporting native cryptocurrencies for payments or as a store of value.      I think that’s patently wrong. There’s still plenty of innovation going on in blockchain-founded and blockchain-inspired multi-party computing solutions. Real progress is being made to overcome some of the sticking points that initially slowed the technology’s real-world deployment – in trusted computing, in internet-of-things integrations and in digital identities.      Meanwhile, in supply-chain applications, in public health and in credentialing systems, blockchain technologies are already operating in the real world, though they are very much in the background as a low-key element inside otherwise multifaceted solutions. Worldwide, blockchain has been incorporated into a variety of active information management systems – for example, to trace diamonds and other products in mining supply chains, for private key management in digital identity systems and to enable the right mix of public data and privacy in COVID-19 contact tracing apps. Many of those use IBM technology. That there’s no hyperbolic “blockchain fixes this” fanfare attached to these backend implementations doesn’t make them less relevant.      The problem of “corporate adoption” revolves more around how businesses approach the technology, a flawed mindset that IBM has (perhaps unintentionally) promoted. It’s not the technology’s fault but one of a deep misunderstanding within C-suites of what it offers to their business environment.      The road to success first requires recognition that blockchain technology is not an internal tool but an external one. Its main purpose is to allow non-trusting entities within a particular business ecosystem to share information that’s valuable to all participants without relying on a middleman.      That structure means the blockchain-based data-sharing system must be equally supported by a firm’s competitors and business partners. It requires boldness: a willingness to cede control and to bear the cost of disruption that blockchain-based approaches will impose. Only then can it be used to unlock the rich, systemwide data needed to achieve efficiency around resource management and forge sustainable economic systems that serve both business and society.    ‘We technology’    Big-name consultancies selling “blockchain-as-a-service” (BAAS) have fostered the misguided idea that “blockchain” is akin to a proprietary ERP software product that, once plugged into the IT system, will start boosting efficiency and increasing the bottom line.      But this is not plug-and-play technology. In fact, it’s hard stuff.      To make a blockchain solution work across a supply chain or an electricity grid (for example) requires each player to contribute to the greater good, in code development, in computing resources, in sharing data. To quote a cheesy line I used in presentations during my own time consulting in a pre-CoinDesk life, “Blockchain is a we technology, not a me technology.” It only works when multiple, competing, non-trusting entities agree to use it and share in the gains and headaches.      By extension, a working blockchain involves sharing resources with competitors, including with startups developing disruptive innovations that challenge the incumbent’s core business. It requires an open, collaborative, come-what-may approach to participation that’s anathema to business models built around trade secrets and protecting competitive advantages. For many businessmen, eager to protect people’s bonuses and jobs, it seems like a non-starter.      Yet, history tells us that doing nothing in the face of disruption can have even greater cost, including the collapse of entire firms. The reality is that first-mover companies bold enough to embrace disruptive technologies will gain a competitive advantage over those that can’t take the leap. This innovator’s dilemma is front-and-center for would-be blockchain participants and it’s not properly acknowledged.      To be sure, enterprise blockchain advocates typically understand some aspect of the “me” versus “we” challenge. That’s why there was a rush to form industry blockchain consortia between 2016 and 2018. But as Allison also reported early on in the formation of the TradeLens consortium founded by shipping giant Maersk, those groups are hard to manage precisely because competitors, as well as business partners, will mistrust the motives of the founding institution.      Also, partly because of companies’ unwillingness to cede control, and partly because of regulatory and other constraints, these consortia almost always default to private blockchains with fixed membership. They create walled-garden, closed-loop environments that inevitably innovate less well than open-source communities where ideas from anyone are welcomed and shared.    Embracing the radicals    The hard truth is that for blockchain business consortia to succeed they must accept outsiders, with all the disruptive threats they pose. They must embrace the notion of open-access permissionless innovation that’s at the heart of public blockchain-based crypto communities.      There’s even a role for Big Blue in all this. Leave IBM’s consulting division and you find that open-minded approaches to blockchain still thrive. In those cases, the focus is about what can be built and developed on top of this open distributed ledger architecture, rather than on selling cloud services.      In IBM research, for example, Nitin Gaur, Director of the IBM WW Digital Assets Lab, is doing groundbreaking research into how banks and traditional financial participants might engage with the dynamic, open-source world of decentralized finance (DeFi), perhaps the epitome of freewheeling, public blockchain innovation. (Perhaps only EY blockchain lead Paul Brody is on par in the consulting world for embracing DeFi’s potential.)      Meanwhile, the health sciences team has developed an IBM Digital Health Pass, which provides an innovative, privacy-preserving solution to managing shared COVID-19 health records. You wouldn’t know from the app that it’s powered by a blockchain, but it is.      While its sales pitch on blockchain may not have reflected it, IBM’s history is one of (eventually) shifting with the times and addressing disruption. The reason it has survived, despite massive waste over the years, is that, when push comes to shove, it embraces change. You see it in Big Blue’s journey from mainframe computers to PCs to software development to consultant services.      If it can get away from offering blockchain as some magical solution and instead incorporate it as a back-end element to useful new applications, IBM can help drive real change in business practices around this technology.    Bitcoin Slightly Less ‘Dominant’ Vs. Ethereum    Ethereum’s ether has been on a tear this past week, hitting a new all-time high of $1,740 at the time of writing. Bitcoin also had a good week, just not as crazy good as ether. So it made sense to look at how the metric of “bitcoin dominance” is playing out in the crypto universe, particularly as it compares to the boom period for ether of January 2018.      In this case, CoinDesk’s Shuai Hao used the market cap measurements at the end of January for bitcoin, ether, and for the other 18 digital assets listed in the CoinDesk 20, as the foundation. Then he ran the numbers back to 2017. Sure enough, this is the second-highest proportion of total crypto market cap that ether represents after 2018.      Sustainable? Who knows? For answers, watch how DeFi and the new Ethereum 2.0 project play out.    The Conversation: The fees are too damn high    One reason it was a big week for Ethereum was because it was another big week for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications built on top of it. The amount of total locked value in DeFi has continued to reach new all-time highs on a weekly basis, but its new record – at around $33.45 billion as of Friday morning – was impressive for the speed with which it jumped from $27.31 billion on Jan. 29.      Of course, with growth comes problems, especially because Ethereum hasn’t yet migrated to what is supposed to be a more scalable Ethereum 2.0 blockchain. As such, the congestion of transaction orders pushed up fees paid to miners for clearing transactions. As of early Thursday morning, so-called Ethereum “gas” fees were at record highs.      This prompted Maya Zehavi to point out both the challenges and the opportunities for DeFi innovators, highlighting the gas fee sticker shock and the prospect for layer 2 DeFi solutions that don’t require costly on-chain transaction processing, which would in theory lower transaction costs.      Meanwhile, someone with the Twitter handle @youngtilopa compared Google searches for “DeFi” and one equity stock that’s been in the news recently.      So maybe a sober view is needed. DeFi still has a long road to travel. Whether layer 2 will help it scale and open opportunities for lower-cost transactions remains to be seen.    Relevant Reads: Divergent global regulation    Approaches to cryptocurrency regulation and development continue to vary among the governments of the world. The one consistency is a wariness of crypto; the big difference is how proactively each government is itself acting to innovate with the technology.    Early in the week, we got news India would ban private cryptocurrencies under proposed legislation, fostering a firestorm of criticism for what many said would be the death knell for fintech innovation in the world’s second most populous nation.

""We view 0x Labs as a holistic investment in the DEX space,"" 0x’s Clay Robbins told CoinDesk in a phone call.      Additional participants in the round included Jump Capital, Blockchain Ventures, Coinbase Ventures and others.      The new round comes off the successful launching of 0x’s DEX router, Matcha, which came out in June and has processed $2.7 billion in orders. ""The key thing we're focused on is expansion of Matcha globally,"" Robbins said.      Read more: DeFi’s ‘Agricultural Revolution’ Has Ethereum Users Turning to Decentralized Exchanges      The funds will also be used to further build out 0x Labs’ trading desk business, Periscope Trading; the professional-grade aggregation service, 0x API (which underlies offerings from companies such as ShapeShift, MetaMask and Zapper); and furthering its work on the underlying open-source protocol.    Which way did he go?    0x Labs offers its products without fees because they drive usage of the underlying 0x protocol and its ZRX token. Since version 3.0 of the 0x protocol, the ZRX token has become something market makers can stake in order to earn liquidity rewards. Overall, the protocol has seen $15 billion in trading volume, according to the company.      ""In aggregate since the launch of these mechanics a little over a million dollars has been remitted to these holders. That currently represents about a 10% APY [annual percentage yield],"" Robbins said.      As trading now drives value to the ZRX token, that remains 0x Labs core business model. As the creators of the 0x initial coin offering (ICO), the company remains a significant holder of ZRX.    Read more: How Decentralized Finance Became Ethereum's Top Dog    ZRX was last noteworthy in decentralized finance (DeFi) circles in the early days of COMP liquidity mining, when it was a big gainer for staking and borrowing on Compound's money market. So much so that governance moved to actually change the rules around how COMP returns were disbursed.      The token seems to be coming into its own, though. ZRX, like many other DeFi tokens, has seen outsize gains in recent weeks. Su Zhu of Three Arrows Capital has argued this is because the market is realizing that these tokens represent real value being added in the market:    Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match    Routing DeFi transactions is a tricky thing, like deciding which route to take through a busy city. You have to make a choice but there's no way to know you made the right one.      0x attempted to give users confidence that its proprietary routing software is worthy of their trust by running a lot of transactions across different routing protocols to compare results. A 0x Labs report from October contends that 0x's routing architecture delivered the best overall price seven times out of 10.      The one thing Robbins said that 0x is not working on with this new round is a new token. It is not going to do an airdrop of a Matcha token to past users, like its competitor 1inch did in December, or launch a liquidity mining program to attract customers.

The London-based accounting firm will provide BSN’s Ethereum users in China with two compliance products – EY OpsChain and EY Blockchain Analyzer – according to a press statement shared with CoinDesk.      EY OpsChain will integrate procurement and traceability functions into BSN, where its users on Ethereum can run procurement activities using tokens and smart contracts. The EY Blockchain Analyzer will offer blockchain analytics and financial statement audits to the users.      The new compliance services could further boost China’s efforts in the blockchain race against the U.S. More BSN’s users will be able to build and run blockchain projects in the network without worrying about compliance issues.      “China is one of the largest markets for blockchain technology in the world, and, while EY teams have been operating there for several years, this is the EY organization’s first big step in deploying the EY blockchain platform in a scalable manner,” Paul Brody, global blockchain head at EY, said in the statement.      BSN was co-founded by state-owned telecom giant China Mobile, UnionPay and fintech startup Red Date in April 2020. The project aims to provide cloud services and a standardized development environment for blockchain developers.      BSN is split into two versions: a domestic version, where only permissioned blockchains are available, and a global version, which allows developers around the world to build or run decentralized applications (dapps) on public chains adapted to its development environment. BSN “localized” Ethereum in its domestic version by making it an open permissioned blockchain, which could be controlled by an enterprise.    Read more: China Aims to Be the World’s Dominant Blockchain Power – With Help From Google, Amazon and Microsoft    “Initial availability will focus on the planned open permissioned version of Ethereum in China with a future extension to a controlled access version of the Ethereum network across the globe when it becomes available,” the statement said.      The move came after New York-based Ethereum hub ConsenSys teamed up with BSN in January. That partnership aims to bring ConsenSys’ enterprise ledger, Quorum, to China’s nationwide blockchain project.      BSN was co-founded by state-owned telecom giant China Mobile, UnionPay and fintech startup Red Date in April 2020. The project aims to provide cloud services and a standardized development environment for blockchain developers.

""The BOE wants to have its cake and eat it, too: recognize that negative interest rates as a possible tool, which may help keep rates down without delivering what would appear to be a disruptive move,"" Marc Chandler, a former head currency strategist for foreign-exchange giants Brown Brothers Harriman and HSBC, wrote Thursday on SeekingAlpha.      Negative interest rates have always been a head-scratcher, given the prospect that borrowers in the country may at some point find themselves getting to take out loans, rather than forking over interest payments to their lenders. Or that savers might end up paying banks to hold their money, instead of receiving income on deposits.      Bitcoin's validation? The announcement – made via a published letter that was sent to bankers, with a subsequent news conference held by Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey – offers the latest validation of the economic scenario many bitcoin bulls are betting on: that despite the ongoing rollout of coronavirus vaccines, the world's monetary authorities aren't likely to stop stoking global financial markets with easy money anytime soon.      More money printing: Economists are reading the tea leaves and coming to the conclusion the Bank of England may also opt to increase its £895 billion (US$1.3 trillion) target for asset purchases, a form of stimulus pioneered by the U.S. Federal Reserve in which central banks essentially pump new money into financial markets. Pantheon, the forecasting firm, predicted Thursday the U.K. central bank will increase the target by £50 billion later this year.      The Federal Reserve, for what it's worth, is currently buying $120 billion of assets a month, and Chair Jerome Powell has said there's no need to cut interest rates to negative levels; currently, the key U.S. short-term rate is set at just above zero. But pressure might build on the Fed to experiment with more unconventional monetary policies if the world's other major central banks keep moving in that direction.    Bitcoin Watch    The path of least resistance for bitcoin appears to be to the upside, writes CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole, as demand continues to outstrip supply.    The cryptocurrency has broken out of a descending channel on the daily chart, indicating scope for a re-test of record highs above $41,900, Godbole wrote Friday. The market focus may shift back to bitcoin if the cryptocurrency charts a quick move upwards. (See chart above.)  Stimulus plan moves forward: The U.S. Senate narrowly voted early Friday to adopt a budget blueprint for President Joe Biden's $1.9 billion coronavirus relief package, a legislative track that's being closely watched by bitcoin bulls betting the cryptocurrency can serve as an inflation hedge during an era of outsize government and monetary stimulus.  Dollar strength: The U.S. dollar is on track for its strongest weekly gain since October on investor optimism for a faster economic recovery. The greenback's strength makes bitcoin's 14% gain since Sunday look more impressive because the cryptocurrency's price is denominated in dollars.  Token Watch    DEFI TOKENS MOON: In the past 24 hours, DeFi-linked tokens such as COMP, AAVE, KNC and ZRX leapt to fresh all-time highs. Compound’s governance token COMP clocked a new record of $500, taking the month-to-date gain to above 40%. Oracle provider Chainlink’s LINK token is also benefitting from the broad-based rally across DeFi. AAVE, the token of the DeFi lending protocol Aave, rose 21% to a record. ZRX, from the Ethereum-based decentralized exchange 0x, is up 60% in the past 24 hours.      ETHER GAS PRICE FALLOUT: Japan cryptocurrency exchange Liquid temporarily halted ether (ETH) withdrawals as gas fees hit new highs.      COMPOUND VS. AAVE: Aave has a ""fighting chance"" to the take the crown from Compound as ""DeFi's most popular lending protocol,"" according to The Defiant.    Celebrity Watch    Who ISN'T investing in crypto these days? LL Cool J, the Queens, N.Y.-born rapper and entrepreneur, is among a glitzy roster of limited partners backing North Island Ventures' newly revealed $72 million fund, CoinDesk's Zack Seward reported Thursday. Paul Tudor Jones II, the legendary hedge fund manager who last year was among the first big institutional investors to espouse bitcoin as an inflation hedge, is also involved. North Island Ventures is chaired by Glenn Hutchins, a co-founder of the technology-investment firm Silver Lake and until recently a board member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.      Jack Dorsey has set up his own bitcoin node. The Twitter and Square CEO, who has used his posts to promote the cryptocurrency, shared an image Friday ""showing the node in the action of synchronizing with the bitcoin blockchain,"" CoinDesk's Tanzeel Akhtar reported. In the latest post he wrote simply, “Running #bitcoin.”    What Else    $90M hedge fund deceit: Cryptocurrency hedge fund founder Stefan Qin pleaded guilty in New York Thursday to deceiving investors out of more than $90 million. According to a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday, Qin, a 24-year-old Australian national and founder of Virgil Capital, had been charged with a single count of securities fraud in Manhattan’s federal court.      Arcane stock goes live: Shares in the Norwegian cryptocurrency analysis firm Arcane Crypto started trading Friday under the ticker ARCANE on Nasdaq First North Growth Market, after completion of reverse takeover. According to this, the stock has a market capitalization of about 1.7 billion Swedish krona ($200 million).      Move over, GameStop: Brokerage firms report boom in online bond trading, including corporate debt and mortgage-backed securities.    Was anything wrong with the GameStop saga, or just markets being markets?    U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigators are combing social-media and message-board posts for signs that fraud played a role in the recent GameStop (GME) stock-price pump, Bloomberg News reported. Regulators in Massachusetts are also looking into the case.      Prosecutors reaching: The story shows how pressed the official overseers of traditional markets are to bring a solid case over the move, which appeared to be coordinated by retail stock traders on the Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets. The basic defense is that they were just sharing their opinions publicly, perhaps less suspicious than the type of private information sharing and insider access that's prized on Wall Street.      What's the big deal? Cryptocurrency analysts have noted the similarities between the GameStop saga and the type of anything-goes trading that happens every day in 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week, international digital-asset markets, where no single exchange or country dominates the action and regulations seem to be constantly catching up to the industry's fast-evolving growth. Coordination on social media? Check. Triple-digit percentage moves? Check. A sometimes complete lack of news to explain price pumps or price dumps? Check.      So it's perhaps not surprising some crypto-industry executives are using the opportunity to tee off on everything that's wrong with the traditional financial system. Or maybe what's wrong with believing there's a right way to think about a trade and a wrong way.      William Quigley, managing director of Magnetic, a blockchain and cryptocurrency investment and incubation firm, said in emailed comments Thursday that ""at its core, investing all about convincing someone else of the merits of buying a stock or other asset – or the opposite.""      Even in traditional markets, there are all sorts of reasons for getting in and out of the market – including ""programmatic trading that pays no heed at all to underlying fundamentals.""      ""The notion that WallStreetBets is somehow illegitimate because it is encouraging going long GME without solid fundamentals to back it up there is irrelevant,"" Quigley said.      The ""pure speculation"" in dogecoin recently is no different, he added.      Dogecoin, for those who haven't followed the thread, is a ""meme token,"" symbolized by the Japanese dog breed Shina Inu, was launched in 2013 as a joke. Elon Musk, the electric-vehicle and private-spaceflight entrepreneur who's reportedly the world's richest man, likes to tweet about it. People are talking about it on the Reddit forum r/SatoshiStreetBets.      ""It has no fundamental value drivers,"" Quigley said. ""People buy dogecoin for one reason: pure speculation. They hope other people will buy it and pay a higher price.”      Quigley is giving his opinion.

According to a German prosecutor cited by Reuters Friday, the convicted criminal is refusing to share the password that would allow the authorities to access the bitcoin.  The hacker was sentenced to an over two-year prison term for installing software on other people’s computers without permission in order to mine cryptocurrency.  He has now served the sentence and has consistently refused hand over the wallet password, despite multiple requests.  “We asked him but he didn’t say,” prosecutor Sebastian Murer told Reuters. “Perhaps he doesn’t know.”  Prosecutors have made sure the man cannot access the bitcoin trove after release, Reuters said without providing any further detail.

42405841,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeovHm,1612527860,"DeFi Season? LINK, AAVE, ZRX and COMP Hit Record Price Highs, Outperforming Bitcoin","Investors look to be temporarily shifting focus away from bitcoin and toward crypto tokens associated with decentralized finance (DeFi).      In the past 24 hours, DeFi-linked coins such as COMP, AAVE, KNC and ZRX have all leapt to fresh lifetime highs.      Compound's governance token COMP clocked a new record of $500, taking the month-to-date gain to above 40%. The token jumped 130% last month and has risen by 20% in the past 24 hours, according to data provider CryptoCompare.      Oracle provider Chainlink's LINK token is also benefitting from the broad-based rally across DeFi. The token printed a lifetime high of $26.98 during the Asian hours, toppling the previous peak of $25.81 reached on Jan. 25, CoinDesk 20 data shows.      AAVE, the token of the DeFi lending protocol of the same name, also rose 21% to reach record price of $545 and is now trading around $491, per CryptoCompare.      Lastly, the ZRX token from Ethereum-based decentralized exchange 0x, set a lifetime high of $2.50 earlier on Friday and was last seen changing hands near $1.66, representing an 102% gain on a 24-hour basis.      The token has more than doubled in value since Wednesday, surpassing the 2020 peak price of $0.96, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      Notably, ZRX's 24-hour volume of $1.59 billion is bigger than its market capitalization of $1.38 billion, which is quite unusual. The breakout to new highs looks to have revved up traders' interest in the token.      Most of these coins have chalked up notable gains in recent days in a potential sign that investors are realizing the revenue potential of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and other DeFi solutions, according to Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based prime brokerage Bequant.      The DeFi coins look undervalued if we compare bitcoin's (BTC) valuation to Uniswap, the biggest DEX by trading volume.      ""While Uniswap has a market cap of $6 billion and an annualized revenue of $1.1 billion, bitcoin's market cap or valuation of $700 billion is significantly higher than the annualized [miner] revenue of $1.5 billion,"" Vinokourov told CoinDesk.      Therefore, the DeFi tokens look to have significant upside potential. William Noble, a chief market technician at Token Metrics, expects such coins to mimic bitcoin's 2017 bull run this year.      Alongside the rally across DeFi, bitcoin remains mostly flat near $37,450 Friday.    Bitcoin looking north    However, the path of least resistance for bitcoin appears to be on the higher side, as demand continues to outstrip supply, as discussed earlier this week. Technical studies are aligned with fundamentals.      The cryptocurrency has broken out of a descending channel on the daily chart, indicating scope for a re-test of record highs above $41,900. The market focus may shift back to bitcoin if the cryptocurrency charts a quick move upwards.

According to a report by the Australian Financial Review on Friday, the central bank's assistant governor for financial systems, Michelle Bullock, said there's ""a lot of fuss over bitcoin.""      The comments were a response to Queensland Liberal National Party member Julian Simmonds, who'd asked the assistant governor if the bank viewed bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a financial risk.      ""[Bitcoin] is not a payment instrument and it's not even really money,"" said Bullock. “I think there is a lot of fuss about it as a potential asset.""      Bullock said she didn't see bitcoin volatility as a risk to the market – a view that was echoed by Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe.      “[Bitcoin] is a risk to investors but its not a financial stability risk,” Lowe said.      Bullock noted that issues being broadcasted more prominently revolved around stablecoin regulation.      ""Facebook is putting out diem [formerly libra], there is a lot of discussion about this. We are engaged with other regulators about this,” said Bullock in the report.

42405837,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeovFo,1612519419,Credit Card Companies Should Offer Stablecoin Payments or Be Left Behind: Gartner,"Centralized payment companies such as Visa, Mastercard and PayPal will need to adapt if they are to survive the potential demand for blockchain-based stablecoin payments, according to research firm Gartner.      In a Thursday blog post, Gartner notes that, while new bitcoin (BTC) offerings from such firms are helping to prepare the transition to a future payment infrastructure, their revenue is based on charging transaction fees for clearing and settlement.      The fee strategy, which sit at odds with blockchain's peer-to-peer model, could be the very thing that sees these firms fall behind the competition from stablecoin payment networks, per the post penned by Avivah Litan, distinguished VP analyst at Gartner.      Litan described such firms as ""centralized decentralized finance"" (CeDeFi) – in which centralized, mainstream firms with big bitcoin holdings bring innovation to the DeFi space and, conversely, adopt DeFi's biggest apps.      But Litan points out that customers of these types of services are likely wondering if they will be obliged to pay centralized service fees for moving their cryptocurrency along the blockchain in the near future, defeating the technology's initial promise.      ""Companies we speak to are justifiably skeptical of these services,"" Litan wrote. ""After all, the revolution of blockchain payments is that they execute peer-to-peer and eliminate central intermediaries and associated bank fees.""      However, the author added Gartner has yet to see a range of offerings from the crypto space for viable stablecoin payments, pointing to a lack of easily accessible applications and fees lower than are currently on offer from card networks or firms like Square and PayPal.      Litan said there's potential for card firms to provide a range of as-yet-unseen offerings, such as transparent real-time stablecoin payments on the blockchain tied to underlying information regarding a given transaction, and protections for funds backing stablecoin sitting in partner bank accounts.      Card companies could provide the gateways for payors and payees and add functionality, according to the post.      ""The card brands could still earn revenues from on and off ramp value-added services, and from interest on the reserves underlying the stablecoins,"" Litan said.      By 2022, CeDeFi could be ready for enterprise adoption if the regulatory guidance is present, the research analyst predicted.      See also: Visa May Add Cryptocurrencies to Its Payments Network, Says CEO      But, should the legacy payment companies fail to keep pace with the likes of fiat on/off ramps, such as fast-moving cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Gemini, other firms are going to step forward.      ""Will these centralized financial services companies go forward in line with the spirit of blockchain peer to peer payments at the risk of cannibalizing their existing central-clearing house based-revenue streams?"" Litan asked. ""The answer will depend on whether or not these firms have any practical choice.""",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | RESEARCH,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/05/credit-card-companies-should-offer-stablecoin-payments-or-be-left-behind-gartner,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d6bc4b804b8e8eb6e8950bc4433d8557d8b40c9c-1500x1257.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday, Qin, a 24-year-old Australian national and founder of Virgil Capital, had been charged with a single count of securities fraud in Manhattan's (N.Y.) federal court.      Between 2017 and 2020, Qin operated two funds, Virgil Sigma Fund LP of New York and VQR Multistrategy Fund LP of the Cayman Islands. During that time Qin lied to investors and siphoned off the roughly $90 million from Sigma to fund a lavish lifestyle, per the release.      He further lied about the performance of the Sigma fund and the whereabouts of investors' money, as well as attempting to cover his fraud by paying back Sigma investors by dipping into VQR funds.      The Securities and Exchange Commission accused Qin of the fraud in December, saying the man had “fabricated records,” failed to allow investors redeem $3.5 million and tried to withdraw $1.7 million in investor funds to pay off Chinese loan sharks.
