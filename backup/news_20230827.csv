16646789,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549051,1693173659,BONE Coin Surges 11% On Weekly Chart Amid Crypto Turbulence – What’s Next?,"In the aftermath of the crypto market sell-off, BONE/USD currently trades at $1.31 in the last 24 hours, with a trading volume of $8.8 billion. This marks an over 11% price increase in the last seven days. If the Bone Shiba swap continues following the current market trends, the coin will soon hike to 20% next week. A significant recent event that has piqued the interest of investors and enthusiasts is the relaunch of Shibarium, the decentralized exchange tied to BONEUSD. This relaunch has breathed new life into the BONE ecosystem, contributing to a surge in transaction volumes and a positive trajectory in its price. This development underscores the importance of ecosystem expansion and community engagement in driving cryptocurrency value. Technical Analysis: Decoding The Trends In the case of BONEUSD, most technical indicators are bullish on BONEUSD; the 50-day moving average (MA) is pivotal in assessing the mid-term trend. Currently trading above this MA, BONEUSD indicates positive momentum. Notably, the short-term 20-day MA has crossed over the 50-day MA, a potential harbinger of a bullish trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers around 46.63 in the neutral zone, signaling that the market can go either way. RSI values exceeding 70 imply overbought conditions, while those below 30 suggest oversold conditions. The current RSI level indicates a balanced market sentiment. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram is in positive territory, hinting at the potential continuation of an upward trajectory. The signal line positioning above the MACD line also bolsters the case for potential price gains. Drawing insights from technical indicators and recent market performance, BONEUSD is poised in a promising position. The alignment of moving averages points to a possible bullish trend, while the RSI reinforces a balanced sentiment. The positive MACD histogram amplifies the argument for potential price appreciation. This convergence of indicators underscores the optimistic prospects for BONEUSD. Immediate support for BONEUSD is discernible at $1.13 and $1.070, while resistance levels are present at $2.06 and $1.7640. These markers serve as indispensable guides for traders aiming to optimize their entry and exit points, enhancing their potential gains. The Ecosystem And Community Factor: Catalysts For Growth BONEUSD’s recent surge in transaction volumes and the Shibarium relaunch engender confidence in the coin’s momentum. Moreover, the strong involvement of the Shiba Inu community and the increasing trend of meme-inspired tokens like BONE have the potential to breathe new life into its upward momentum. It’s important to consider the impact of community excitement and advancements in the ecosystem, as these factors can significantly shape the path of a cryptocurrency’s progression. It’s essential to remember the crypto market is notorious for its volatility. Despite favorable indicators and promising developments, external factors can substantially influence prices. As with any investment, conducting thorough research before making any financial commitments is always advisable. In conclusion, Bone ShibaSwap (BONEUSD) has recently exhibited positive price movements, buoyed by encouraging technical indicators and heightened transaction volumes. While historical performance doesn’t guarantee future results, the prevailing market sentiment and community engagement could contribute to BONEUSD’s continued upswing in the near term.

He was the former CEO of one of Thailand's largest real estate developers and has a cryptocurrency background. Thailand recently elected its new Prime Minister – Srettha Thavisin. Thavisin was the president and CEO of Sansiri, one of the country's largest real estate developers and an active investor in Thailand's digital asset industry. Pheu Thai Party Plans to Reintroduce Digital Wallet Programme On August 22, Thavisin was elected as Thailand's next prime minister after receiving 482 out of a possible 747 votes in parliament. The former real estate tycoon was the only candidate the Pheu Thai Party nominated. Thavisin will become prime minister after receiving approval from the King of Thailand – King Maha Vajiralongkorn. Thailand's next prime minister resigned from his post at Sansiri in April after speculation arose that he would become Prime Minister. Thavisin also sold his 4.4% stake in Sansiri. Sansiri participated in a $225 million capital raise for a crypto-friendly investment management firm, XSpring Capital, in 2021. Since the fundraiser, XSpring launched a crypto trading platform and aims to become a top-three company in the crypto exchange market as soon as 2025. The Bangkok Post recently reported that one of Srettha's campaign promises was to reintroduce a national ""airdrop"" where each Thai citizen over the age of 16 will receive 10,000 Thai baht ($300). According to a spokesperson for the Pheu Thai Party, the 10,000 Thai baht can only be spent within a four-kilometre range of their homes. The Bangkok Post further reports that the airdrop will use a form of national token, not an existing digital asset or crypto. Business owners can convert the national token to cash at designated banks. Thavisin's government will assume office by the end of September. The country's next prime minister took to Twitter days before the vote to assure Thai citizens that he aims to ""improve the country and the economy."" He said: ""My enemies are poverty and the inequality of the people. My goal is the well-being of all Thai people.""

16611274,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549041,1693122286,Worldcoin Meltdown: 50% Crash Caused By Mounting Data Privacy Paranoia,"The Worldcoin cryptocurrency project, led by Sam Altman, the brains behind ChatGPT, is facing increased scrutiny from regulators worldwide. The project’s use of eye-ball scanning orbs for user enrollment has raised concerns about potential violations of data protection laws. The unique method of collecting biometric data without clear consent has prompted discussions on legality and ethics. Regulatory bodies are closely examining the project’s compliance with privacy regulations, highlighting the challenges of balancing innovation with legal and ethical standards. The value of biometric investments made through Worldcoin’s crypto-based “free money” promise has decreased by half since its launch. This decline can be attributed to the growing concerns about the project’s data collection and the unease it caused regulators. Why Is Worldcoin Token Crumbling? Based on information provided by CoinMarketCap, the current trading value of the WLD token stands at $1.28, at the time of writing. This figure signifies a substantial decline of 53% from its initial peak price of $2.71 on the day of the project’s launch. The day after WLD’s Binance listing, on July 25, it traded for $2.456. As of Friday morning, the token’s price had decreased from that time to $1.317. Given that several altcoins and cryptocurrencies recently had market crashes followed by recoveries within a few weeks, this is a big decrease for a token. WLDUSDT trading at $1.286 on the weekend chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: Tron Reverses August Slump As TRX Open Interest Climbs According to data from CoinGecko, the price of WLD has decreased from slightly under $2.50 at the start of August to roughly $1.31 as of August 25. That represents a 44% decline in the previous 30 days, and if it keeps going in the wrong direction, WLD’s price will go to single digits in the next 30 days. Ongoing investigations by authorities in various countries around the world have dealt a heavy blow to the price of the WLD token. The project’s goal of establishing decentralized user identities has raised alarm bells because of its eye-ball scanning and biometric data collection. This process potentially breaches national data protection laws, leading to investigations in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. The Euphoria Quickly Faded Worldcoin reported 2 million sign-ups for World ID and distributed 43 WLD tokens during its launch. Altman promoted iris scanning, but the initial excitement waned. Early scanners received 25 WLD valued at $60, now reduced to around $30. Early investors could have lost half their investment, while short sellers profited from Worldcoin’s decline. Meanwhile, in the last 30 days, WLD’s social volume and social dominance have decreased by a whopping 95% and 74%, respectively, according to on-chain data source Santiment. This denotes a sharp decline in the project’s hype. Source: Santiment Related Reading: Shiba Inu Nears Make-Or-Break Resistance Barrier – What Awaits Traders?

This increase has ignited renewed interest in cryptocurrency and sparked inquiries regarding the coin’s potential for sustained growth in the foreseeable future. At the time of writing, Toncoin (TON) boasts an impressive price of $1.46, securing its position as the 14th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, around $5 billion USD. Related Reading: This Ethereum Metric Has Sparked Centralization Concerns Over ETH Ownership Toncoin Technical Analysis Taking a technical perspective, Toncoin’s price chart reveals several interesting developments worth noting. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 58.29, suggesting a balanced interaction between buying and selling pressures. This indicates that the market is in a relatively neutral state. However, the RSI’s upward trend over the past week suggests that bullish sentiment among traders is strengthening. The MACD Level (12, 26) at 0.0287 further supports the bullish sentiment with a buy indication. Additionally, the Momentum (10) at 0.0417 reinforces the positive momentum, indicating an opportunity for further upward movement. From a short-term perspective, the moving averages paint an encouraging picture. The crossover of the 50-day moving average (MA) above the 200-day MA suggests a shift in momentum from bearish to bullish. This crossover is generally considered a positive signal, adding to the optimistic outlook for Toncoin. Examining Toncoin’s performance over the past months reveals a nuanced story. While the cryptocurrency has shown resilience, recording a gain of 8.83% in the last week and 8% over the past month, it’s crucial to acknowledge its previous downward trend. Toncoin experienced a significant decline of 25.90% in the last three months and an even more pronounced drop of 40.74% in the last six months. These figures underscore the inherent volatility associated with Toncoin’s market movements. More Gains Ahead? In light of prevailing market sentiment and recent price actions, investors are presented with multiple potential scenarios. The bullish momentum witnessed in the short term may persist, particularly if the bullish crossover of the MACD indicator gains additional strength. However, a prudent approach is warranted, given the cryptocurrency’s history of significant downturns. It is advisable for traders to meticulously monitor critical support and resistance levels to make well-informed decisions. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Community Burn Sees Another 350 Million Meme Coins Incinerated Based on the current technical analysis, Toncoin (TON) is experiencing a positive phase, with indicators such as RSI, Stochastic, CCI, and moving averages reflecting a neutral to bullish stance.
