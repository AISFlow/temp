The same was the case with Ethereum, whose market cap grew to the hundreds of billions. However, the growth that these digital assets have already seen over the years, it has put a hamper on how much they can still grow over the coming years. This is why investors are looking elsewhere for larger gains. Bitcoin, Ethereum Gains Are Lower Over the last bull market, it became apparent that bitcoin and Ethereum will no longer be able to give the kind of returns that early investors had gotten. During the previous cycle low, bitcoin had dropped to as low as $6,000 but had reached $69,000 during its peak. This was a 10x growth for the digital asset.

42411367,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNIth,1664575682,I Made an NFT Collection to Represent My Student Loan Debt,"Talk of mass student loan forgiveness will hopefully help students, but it can also shame them.  Many people regard it as yet another expense we can't handle as a country while also refusing to acknowledge the societal expectation put upon young adults that they need to go to college to succeed. Additionally, loans for student borrowers are higher than almost any business loan and even most mortgage rates dating back to the 1980s.  Alex Hluch is a producer, writer and comedian residing in Los Angeles. This article is part of CoinDesk's ""Education Week.""  This nexus of forces, combined with the fact that financial literacy is not taught in the public education system, causes shame and regret among student borrowers. I wanted to create something to comment on this unique experience, as I have a significant amount of debt across multiple institutions.  See also: Best Universities for Blockchain 2022  “College Admission” is a performance art piece. I traveled to each of the nine institutions I attended as a student and took a photo on campus with either my diploma or my transcript. The price of each photo is equivalent to the amount of debt I have from each university, and the non-fungible tokens (NFT) representing the schools where I don’t have any debt are up for auction starting at 1 USDC each.  This collection seeks to showcase the vast economic disparity between public and private academic institutions as well as the chasm between graduate and undergraduate education.  My goal with this project is to devillify those with student loan debt, the pursuit of higher education and financial regret. I want to take a truly critical lens to an American institution that has become culturally de rigueur.  I chose NFTs as a medium because I believe in blockchain as the future of education. And if I'm truly being honest, I find it hilarious that someone can obtain roughly as much as I obtained for some of these degrees. (In my case, a piece of paper. In the buyer's case, a well-thought-out photo of that piece of paper.)  I ruminated on this project for months before starting and I quickly realized that not only is the stigma behind having student loan debt building on a principal shame of not having enough money to support one's self during college, but there's also added shame in disclosing just how much you've spent, and on what degree. Culturally, $100,000 on a JD is far different than $100,000 on an MFA.  I know. I have two MFAs.  See also: NFT Artist Brian Frye Wants You to Steal This Article  Over the course of my far-too-extended academic career, I attended nine institutions: community colleges, public universities, graduate programs, an early-enrollment program and one private university. I attended this many institutions because I truly loved education and academia, and I craved the security that comes with “having a graduate education.” My experience showed me every different realm of higher education and gave me insight into their variables.  None of my debt comes from an institution I attended for undergrad – I only have debt at the three institutions I attended for my graduate education. And yet, I have over $180,000 in student loan debt across these three institutions. Over half of the debt ($110,000) comes from the one private institution (Loyola Marymount) while the rest (less than half) comes from the other two institutions, which are public.  This entire project was an exercise in shame and vulnerability. The largest current problem with amassing great amounts of student loan debt (other than the crippling financial burden that keeps you from accumulating any positive station in life) is the stigma the country has lumped on student borrowers.  See also: Why Rankings – Including University Rankings – Are Crap | Opinion  We have spent generations telling everyone that they need to go to college or they won’t be safe in the country’s economic landscape. America treats college like a golden ticket while simultaneously shaming and scaring anyone out of any alternative life path. Additionally, predatory lending practices (anything over 3% is predatory when student borrowers have little to no financial acumen, as I did at 21) have catapulted an entire generation into a debt crisis that makes saving for retirement much more difficult.  To be clear, I'm a staunch advocate of civilizations advancing knowledge and critical thinking, but we need to look at the predatory lending practices around federal (and especially private) student loans. (Do we honestly think giving kids a loan at 6% interest when they've just turned 18 is a sound economic idea?) We need to redirect the focus from how taxpayers are shouldering the burden to how the federal government publicly exploits young people who want to better themselves, all while saving money on state-subsidized public education.  With this NFT collection I hope to make others feel less guilty for seeking to obtain something they were told to want. I hope to make others reassess that the villain isn't the pursuit of higher education, but the political benefactors and banks that have made wild profits off of this endeavor.

The coin could slowly attempt to trade near its next resistance mark, and with growing demand, it could get past that price mark. The support zone for that price rested between $0.43 and $0.39, respectively. It is important for XRP to get back up to $0.51, which has been acting as a rigid price ceiling for the coin. Once XRP moves up beyond $0.51, the coin will strengthen its bullish move. The technical indicator of the coin has signalled an increased bullish momentum.

42393944,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brdDTL,1664574485,Crypto and the ‘Law of the Horse’,"In the mid-1990s, around the time that former Grateful Dead lyricist John Perry Barlow was toying around with the idea that cyberspace could be a place independent of any nation, lawyers were growing concerned that this emerging technology would put them out of a job.  The world wide web was collapsing boundaries between people, between countries and allowing for the wide dissemination of all information. Could copyrights, for instance, survive online? Or would there need to be an entirely new category of law, applicable to and designed for this new digital age?  Judge Frank H. Easterbrook, of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School, was tapped to discuss just this issue at a legal conference. His non-binding ruling? There is no such thing as “internet law” or “computer law,” just as there is no legal code constituting “horse law.”  This article is part of CoinDesk’s “Education Week.”  “Only by putting the law of the horse in the context of broader rules about commercial endeavors could one really understand the law about horses,” Easterbrook said in his memorable speech, ”Cyberspace and the Law of the Horse.”  Today, many of the same questions that were asked about the legal circumstances of the internet are being raised again by cryptocurrencies. It’s not uncommon to hear from users, builders or salespeople of crypto projects that the legal picture remains uncertain. Or that there’s a lack of clarity.  Despite not being a unified theory, “crypto law” has steadily emerged as an area of professional focus. There are in-house lawyers at decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), litigators who know the ins and outs of decentralized finance (DeFi) and a growing number of consumer advocates.  See also: Best Universities for Blockchain 2022  Universities, too, looking to differentiate themselves or appeal to their students’ interests are adding courses, modules or tracks dedicated to blockchain law. Students are eager to build their expertise in a rapidly growing sector, and professors are struggling about what to say about a field where so many legal questions remain unanswered.  “A lot of law schools are trying to find ways to make their programs stand out from the crowd, and are hiring people that can teach in this unique focused area,” Christa Laser, an assistant professor of law at Cleveland State University, said in an interview. “They’re learning to teach in a way that can keep students engaged and [prepared] for jobs with higher income potential.”  Crypto, like the world of Big Tech that came before it, often offers young lawyers greater opportunity and higher paychecks than they would otherwise have access to. ""Intellectual property and tech jobs in law have higher income potential,"" Laser said, adding, ""knowing about crypto, as well as other new technologies like AI as they arise, will help new lawyers earn good job prospects.""  It is a point echoed by Brian Frye, an artist and lawyer who has taught courses touching on crypto at a number of universities over the years.  “You're always training people for the market,” Frye, now at the University of Kentucky, said in an interview. And the market is always changing. For most of the 20th century, law students were primarily prepped to either go into individual practice or work for major legal firms.  That started shifting with the advent of the internet and rise of the tech industry, where it became more common for major firms to hire legal experts and keep them in-house. “A lot of these people essentially created the jobs for themselves,” Frye said, mentioning corporations like Google and Coinbase that have robust legal teams.  This trend has continued in crypto. Kraken, the U.S.-based crypto exchange, has, for instance built a robust legal operation led by crypto lawyer Marco Santori, the firm’s incoming CEO, Dave Ripley, said in a recent CoinDesk TV interview.  “We’ve also built out a policy team recently [and] this group works out the forward-looking engagement with both regulators and lawmakers and that team is now 10+. Marco’s team overall is 50+,” Ripley said. He added Kraken has another 300 legal experts working “in and around compliance.”  “The key thing is to approach [crypto law] entrepreneurially,” Frye said. “Engage in the job that they want to have, figure out who's offering that position and explain to a company why they need to hire you specifically.”  Laser struck a more conciliatory note, noting that a few people could likely build a career practicing a niche area of law, but the field could quickly become oversaturated.  “I would say it's helpful for law schools to add a course on crypto because it's sexy to students,” she said. “But in terms of whether it actually would help those students in the long run …  “It's going to depend upon how big of an industry it becomes. At this point, we just don't know how much of an impact crypto is going to have on day-to-day business in high revenue industries,” she added, mentioning consumer electronics and banking as examples.  Chris Odinet, a professor of law at University of Iowa, also had his doubts about “crypto law” as a legal profession or topic of study.  “Transactions involving crypto companies and crypto assets intersect with and are involved and impacted by lots of different areas of the law – but there's no ‘crypto law’ per se,” Odinet said. “There's property law, contract law, securities law, commercial law, but there's no such thing as crypto law. It's not its own self-contained thing.”  There’s no law of the horse.  Some people in crypto today, like Barlow before, even go so far as saying that code is law. Or that smart contracts (applications that run blockchain-based programs) obviate the need for human contracts.  Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Gary Gensler has pushed back on this concept. In a recent spate of media engagements, Gensler has argued that there is no need for bespoke regulations for the cryptocurrency industry. The vast majority of cryptocurrencies and tokens, he said, are clearly securities according to existing standards.  See also: Crypto Goes to College  But even Easterbrook realized that the law is not always “optimal.” Further, he said, the arrival of new technologies or practices could be a change to update the legal code. “Why seventeen years for patents, a lifetime plus some for copyrights, and forever for trademarks?” he asked.  Even if there is no unified “crypto law,” could these new tools that offer new ways of owning and sharing digital property push the U.S. legal system forward?  Frye said non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in particular are raising interesting questions about copyright. “Freedom of speech and copyright have always been in tension,” he said. “We pretend [copyright] is just about economics, and not about policing the content of speech,” but what happens when a new tool like [non-fungible tokens] comes around and allows people to monetize other people’s speech.  Whether a term like “crypto law” makes sense, or whether it’s a fit subject to study in school, is almost besides the point. As long as there are unanswered legal questions, lawyers will be needed.

There are, however, 36% more NFT traders now than there were a year ago, according to a report by DappRadar. “NFT volumes are way down across the board, but interest is still high,” Krogsgard said. “We're still super excited about the future of NFTs.”  Flip, launched amid the NFT winter in April 2022 by Krogsgard and co-founders Sam Hotchkiss and Jennifer Jacobs, helps customers navigate the actual – not fantasy – NFT market, enabling trading on multiple marketplaces and providing portfolio and wallet tracking.

42394715,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASV1wX,1664572212,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Holds Strong Above $19.5K as Investors Chew Over Latest Price Data,"Price Action  Bitcoin (BTC) was recently trading at about $19,500, up about 0.3% over the past 24 hours in choppy trading. Prices jumped sharply during the 14:00 UTC (10:00 a.m. ET) time frame and even cracked the $20,000 threshold shortly after a speech on global financial stability by U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard. BTC then retreated to a range between $19,500 and $20,000 in the subsequent hours but experienced a sudden sell-off right before the U.S. equity market close.  Brainard reiterated the Federal Reserve’s commitment to taming inflation, even at the expense of a hard economic landing. “Inflation is very high in the United States and abroad, and the risk of additional inflationary shocks cannot be ruled out,” she said at an event in New York.  Ether’s (ETH) price recently rose to about $1,340, a 0.4% gain from the same time the previous day. The trading volume of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was down 2.3%. Its return on investment (ROI) has fallen 13% in the past 30 days as equity markets wrapped up the third quarter.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures performance across a basket of cryptocurrencies, rose 0.76%.  “It's been a very choppy week in bitcoin, which has failed to make a sustainable run in either direction despite attempts at both,” Oanda Senior Analyst Craig Erlam wrote in an email, although he noted that bitcoin seemed to be forming a floor “a little shy of the early summer lows around $17,500.”  “I keep using the word resilience when discussing bitcoin and that has very much remained the case,” he wrote, adding: “Perhaps a period of stability is what it needs.”  Economic calendar  The core personal consumption expenditure (PCE), the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of U.S. inflation, was hotter than expected in August, rising 4.9% on a year-over-year basis after increasing 4.7% in July.  Looking ahead, the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for September issued in the U.S. and the U.K. will be released on Monday. The indexes will offer the latest evidence of manufacturing activity in both countries and the direction of their economies, which now seem to point to a sharper economic slowdown than their central banks had been hoping.  U.S. equities  U.S. equities slogged through a dreary day, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq, the S&P 500 (which has a heft technology component) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) declining 0.8%, 0.9% and 1.2%, respectively. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index results for August, released Friday, spooked investors already fretting about high inflation.  The PCE, which excludes energy costs, is a widely watched measure of price trends. Stocks have fallen steadily downward this year, with the DJIA this week becoming the latest index to fall into bear market territory, meaning it has fallen at least 20% from its previous high.  Commodities  Gold ticked down a fraction of a percentage point, continuing a recent trend. The traditional safe-haven investment has been swept up with riskier assets and is trading at about $1,661, a more than 14% drop over the past six months.  Brent crude oil, a widely watched measure of energy markets, was selling at about 85% per barrel, up slightly, although investors remain nervous about energy prices amid threatening remarks by Russian President Vladimir Putin and the possible widening of Russian military aggression beyond Ukraine.

Technical Take  Quant Network Token Leads Weekly Gainers  By Lyllah Ledesma  The token, QNT, of Quant Network, a multi-faceted blockchain platform that facilitates the development of central bank digital currencies among its users, was the top-gaining cryptocurrency over the past week. QNT was recently trading at about $143, a roughly 27% increase over the past seven days.  The increase comes as U.S. and foreign agencies wrestle with a vast array of cryptocurrency regulatory issues, including stablecoins and central bank digital currencies.  Last week, as CoinDesk reported, U.S. House Democrats hashing out the details of this year's stablecoin regulation bill pushed for a provision directing the Federal Reserve to move forward on a digital dollar, but the negotiations settled instead on another Fed study. Even that compromise is on uncertain ground as the legislation hasn't yet been issued publicly.  The draft of the House bill, which is now circulating among lawmakers and the industry, won’t yet represent the authorization Fed officials have said they are waiting for from Congress before they decide to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The federal government has been inching closer to such an approval, with the U.S. Treasury Department recommending in a recent report that work on a digital dollar should continue while the executive branch also comes to a decision.  Noting Quant’s CDBC business, Crypto Finance AG sales trader David Scheuermann wrote in a note that “it's no secret that governments are pushing to crack down on current stablecoins, and exploring their own digital currencies, CBDCs.”  He added: “These recent political developments have sparked rumors of central banks adopting Quant Network’s overledger technology for CBDC developments,” said Scheuermann.

The world&apos;s largest digital token by market cap (BTC-USD) inched up 0.8% in Q3, changing hands at $19.45K as of shortly before 4:30 p.m. ET.

The Washington, D.C., company recently won a Defense Department contract to look into crypto security risks.  “There’s a wide acknowledgement that while there are national security issues, it is a national security imperative in the U.S. to foster [crypto] innovation here [and] to have startups in the U.S. and not leaving to go overseas,” said Adam Zarazinski, Inca Digital’s CEO, on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Friday.  According to a press release, the Defense Department's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) awarded Inca Digital's government contracting division, Inca Digital Federal, a Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract to research advanced methods for analyzing activity related to financial applications of distributed ledgers, in a project called ""Mapping the Impact of Digital Financial Assets.""  Inca will provide technology that can be “used to identify risks to U.S. national security globally,” Zarazinski said.  Read more: DARPA to Research Risks of Crypto to National Security in Partnership With Inca Digital  “The technological development that we’re doing is ultimately to foster innovation here in the United States,” Zarazinski added.  Inca is trying to identify how crypto may influence traditional financial systems, he said. U.S. government agencies are concerned with the economic impact of crypto and its blockchain-based use case as it relates to illicit activities such as money laundering, hacks and sanction evasion.  Not only do those factors have “wide-ranging implications” for U.S. national security, but they can also affect “an individual’s belief [in] crypto,” Zarazinski said.  Read more: National Security at Stake With Biden's Crypto Executive Order / Opinion  He added that so far Inca has connected to an estimated “350 trading venues globally,” including “centralized exchanges, indexes and peer-to-peer networks.” The software company also collects data from social media sites, including Twitter, Reddit, Telegram and Discord, said Zarazinski.  “We collect blockchain data and run our nodes, similar to that of forensics companies, but we also have a heavy emphasis on collecting market data,” he said. “We bring that data into our system, and then basically try to connect crypto to the real world, [to] analyze markets and ensure market integrity,” he added.  Addressing privacy concerns, Zarazinski said U.S. government agencies aren’t making “some play on surveilling Americans and what they’re doing with crypto.” Rather, “this is looking at what’s going to happen with crypto and global markets in the next 10 years and what role can the U.S economy play within that.”  Read more: The NSC Labels Blockchain a National Security Issue / Opinion",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/30/data-firm-inca-digital-ceo-crypto-innovation-is-a-matter-of-national-security,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dadc321c7c65be736c4b3748b06a307f689b4812-6646x4430.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In an objection filed Friday, attorneys for the U.S. Trustee Program argued the motions should be denied at least until the independent examiner’s report has been filed. Shoba Pillay, a Chicago-based partner of law firm Jenner & Block, was appointed examiner on Thursday.  Pillay’s examination of Celsius’ holdings and operations will dig into where and how the company is holding customer funds, whether accounts were commingle and why Celsius changed its account offerings for some customers beginning in April from the its Earn program to custody service.  The company's motion to reopen withdrawals would apply only to customers holding “pure custody assets,” which Celsius has failed to define. The objection claims that distributing funds to a limited group of customers without a full understanding of the company’s crypto holdings, its debts and the transfers between its various accounts and subsidiaries could “inadvertently impact or limit distributions to other creditors.”  The trustee’s office made a similar argument against a Celsius plan to sell off its stablecoin holdings. Celsius’ motion, filed Sept. 16, said the money generated from the sale would primarily go to pay for the firm’s operations during the bankruptcy proceedings.  State regulators from Texas and Vermont have already opposed the stablecoin motion, claiming that Celsius is asking for “troublingly broad permission to sell assets insufficiently defined for purposes that are also insufficiently defined.”  “At this juncture, there are too many questions regarding the debtors’ cryptocurrency holdings to approve any withdrawals or sales,” attorneys for the Trustee’s office wrote in the objection. “Those questions arise both from the debtors’ lack of transparency … [and] the Debtors’ failure to file schedules and statements of financial affairs.”  A hearing to discuss the motions is slated for Oct. 6.",NEGATIVE,없음,REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/30/crypto-lender-celsius-shouldnt-reopen-custody-withdrawals-us-trustee-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e51ae7eb62a69b087893c6b225fac088ea8e11e7-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a complaint filed in the Southern District of Florida on Friday, Todd is accused of using various corporate entities – including Digitex LLC, Digitex Ltd., Digitex Software Ltd. and Blockster Holdings Ltd. Corp., – to run an illegal crypto derivatives trading platform.  The CFTC’s enforcement action against Todd is one in a recent string of crypto-related lawsuits brought by the agency, which appears to be cracking down on lawbreakers in the digital-assets industry.  Read more: CFTC’s Ooki DAO Action Shatters Illusion of a Regulator-Proof Protocol  Michael Selig, a crypto attorney at the law firm of Willkie Farr & Gallagher, said that while the CFTC’s action against Todd and Digitex is the regulator’s first against a decentralized-finance (DeFi) platform for failing to register as an exchange, it’s not a surprise to anyone paying attention to what the regulator has been saying about DeFi platforms.  “Former CFTC Commissioner Dan Berkovitz foreshadowed this action in a June 2021 speech where he stated that ‘not only do I think that unlicensed DeFi markets for derivative instruments are a bad idea, I also do not see how they are legal under the CEA,;'” Selig said. “The Digitex action demonstrates that the CFTC is focused on both intermediaries that offer margin and financing to retail crypto-asset traders as well as the platforms.”  Because Todd and the Digitex platforms were never registered with the CFTC as futures commission merchants, the operation was a violation of the CEA, according to the complaint. Todd and the entities are further accused of failing to implement proper know-your-customer practices as required by the Bank Secrecy Act – a violation that can land rulebreakers in prison for up to five years.  Todd is also accused by the CFTC of attempting to manipulate Digitex’s native token, DGTX, using noneconomic trading to “pump” its price higher.

The result of this has been investors seeking refuge in tokens that do not see a lot of volatility, and Ethereum whales have not been left out of this flight to safety. Stablecoins Gain Favor Over the last 24 hours, the trade activity of the top Ethereum whales has shown a big shift towards stablecoins. These whales, who have usually been known to trade across a number of digital assets regardless of their volatility, are taking less risk during this time. The USDT stablecoin has been the number 1 token by trade volume for these top Ethereum whales. The average volume transacted by the whales came out to $267,328, even higher than the volume for ETH, which was the second-highest by trading volume.

42394510,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw978h,1664555253,GameStop NFT Marketplace: A Beginner’s Guide,"On July 11, the world’s largest video game retailer, GameStop, launched a public beta version of its NFT (non-fungible token) marketplace. The gaming-focused decentralized marketplace is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and uses the layer 2 scaling product Loopring to process transactions.  The initial launch was a success and resulted in over $5,000 ETH (around $7.2 million at the time) in trading volume within the first week – more than double Coinbase’s all-time volume.  The platform officially launched on October 31 in partnership with Immutable X, a layer 2 scaling system on the Ethereum blockchain that focuses on Web3 gaming.  The marketplace currently allows users to trade artwork and collectibles that were minted on the platform. In addition to NFTs, GameStop also launched a non-custodial crypto wallet browser extension for Google Chrome and Brave web browsers to allow users to buy Ethereum-based tokens and store their NFTs.  Here’s how to buy and sell digital assets on the GameStop NFT marketplace and use its crypto wallet.  What is the GameStop NFT marketplace?  After struggling to sustain sales as a brick-and-mortar retailer, GameStop began its crypto integration in February 2022 by announcing a partnership with Immutable X. The partnership also established a grant for NFT creators of up to $100 million in Immutable X’s IMX tokens. GameStop initially said that it planned for its marketplace to include “billions of low-cost, in-game assets,” including digital real estate and in-game skins.  Read more: What Are Layer 2s and Why Are They Important?  “The GameStop mission is literally power to the players, and that is exactly what we're trying to do here,” Robbie Ferguson, co-founder of Immutable, told CoinDesk in an interview in February.  In May 2022, the company launched a non-custodial crypto wallet where users could store, send and receive crypto and NFTs. The extension works as a companion to GameStop’s NFT marketplace. Other non-custodial wallets, including WalletConnect and MetaMask, are also compatible with the marketplace.  GameStop chose Loopring, a companion system to the Ethereum network, to power its NFT marketplace because of its scalability and cheaper transaction fees, which typically cost less than a cent. It accomplishes this through zero-knowledge (zk) rollups, which process transactions privately and then roll up several transactions into a single transaction block on a base layer blockchain like Ethereum.  Read more: How Blocks Are Added to a Blockchain, Explained Simply  In addition, GameStop also takes a marketplace fee of 2.25% per transaction and takes a creator royalty fee, which is set by the NFT creator and can range between zero and 10%. Creators receive a royalty fee whenever their NFT is traded on the platform.  Currently, only approved creators can mint NFTs on the platform. The platform also says it is working to support NFTs that originated off-platform on blockchains that it supports.  How to use GameStop NFT marketplace  Step 1: Connect or create a wallet  As a new user, you will need to create a wallet or connect an existing wallet to the platform.  One option is to create a GameStop Wallet by visiting the GameStop Wallet site. Users can begin by clicking “Download Now.”  Once downloaded, click on “Create New Wallet,” where you’ll be prompted to read and agree to the Term and Conditions. You’ll also need to securely save the 12-word Secret Recovery Phrase, or seed phrase, which is essentially your crypto wallet recovery password if you lose access to your account.  Read more: What Is a Seed Phrase?  You will then be prompted to set a password, which you will use to access your GameStop Wallet.  To connect a wallet, visit the login page of the GameStop NFT website, where you will be prompted to choose your preferred wallet and connect.  As of September 2022, GameStop NFT also connects to WalletConnect and MetaMask.  The company says that support for additional wallet providers is “on the way.”  Step 2: Funding the wallet  If the connected wallet already has existing funds, then you can skip this step. New wallets, however, will need to be funded with ether (ETH) before performing any transactions. Funds will then need to be added to the Loopring network in order to be used in the marketplace.  To start, click on your avatar at the top right corner, then “Add funds to L2.” This will give you three options to deposit funds into your Loopring account – buy ETH with a card, deposit ETH from another wallet or request a deposit from another ETH user.  For debit or credit card funds, users can purchase ETH via payment services Ramp or Wyre, both of which have low transaction fees. You can then select either one and input the amount you wish to deposit. Note: These services are not available in all U.S. states and other jurisdictions.  Users can also transfer existing ETH from their connected wallet to GameStop NFT’s layer 2 network. To do so, click on “Deposit ETH from your wallet” and input the amount you wish to deposit. Because this method of deposit is transacted through the layer 1 Ethereum mainnet, users will incur a gas fee, though transactions on the layer 2 network after that will not.  The platform also features a way for users to ask their friends to send them ETH on Loopring using a QR code.  Step 3: Buying an NFT  Once all the above is completed, you can now purchase an NFT on the platform. Start searching for NFT collections by clicking “Explore” on the homepage’s top navigation bar. This will bring you to either a list of NFTs or collections by creators on the platform. At the time of writing, there are over 92,700 NFTs on the platform.  To purchase, select the “Buy now” button, which will open a checkout window to confirm the transaction. Make sure to check all the details before clicking “Confirm payment.""  After the purchase is confirmed and successful, you can view your NFTs by clicking on your profile at the top right corner and selecting the wallet used to purchase the NFT.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | LRC | MX,Marcus Chan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/gamestop-nft-marketplace-a-beginners-guide,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c5823b1c33fe3a585f8b198bf7ff06536bfe5ae-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to the complaint, the two firms falsely claimed between May 2018 and January 2019 that Arbitrade had acquired and received title to $10 billion in gold bullion, and that the company planned to back each DIG token issued and sold to investors with $1 worth of this gold.

42411365,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNIgT,1664554200,The Dollar Can Be a Protocol for the Future of Money,"This week in San Francisco I attended Circle Internet Financial’s star-studded Converge conference and was struck by the wide array of projects working with its USDC stablecoin.  Participants included Latin America-based payments company Ripio, which is seeing surging demand for USDC transfers in Brazil and Argentina, or the Web3 service provider Recur, which solely accepts the stablecoin from users of its various metaverse worlds, including Star Trek Continuum.  It seems USDC, the second most-traded stablecoin, is developing its own “ecosystem,” a word (perhaps overused) that open-source advocates apply to networks of third-party developers and providers that build on a tech platform. Below I’ll get to a lesson I see here for U.S. lawmakers contemplating what digital form the dollar should take. But let’s first reflect on these ecosystem ideas as they pertain to a stablecoin like USDC. It’s not an obvious concept, though its implications are profound.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Let’s compare Converge to NEARCon, the annual conference sponsored by the Near Foundation I attended two weeks ago in Lisbon. It’s easier to understand that event as an “ecosystem conference.” Like other such gatherings – Ethereum’s Devcon being a prime example – Near uses it to bring together and energize the far-flung community of developers and companies building dapps and other services with smart contracts that run on its protocol.  USDC isn’t a smart contract protocol for dapps. It’s primarily a payment vehicle, conceived of by most people as a “coin.” It is a tokenized expression of dollar-based value that happens to be more fluid than non-digital dollars, one that can be exchanged peer-to-peer over public blockchains. (Circle’s launch on Wednesday of a new cross-chain transfer protocol brings USDC a little closer to a more common definition of a crypto protocol, but it’s not why all those third-party, USDC-tied providers attended the event.)  Yet, as I see it, USDC is developing the mother of all protocols.  Money as protocol  When Fortune’s Jeff John Roberts asked Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire at a press conference on Wednesday to clarify what he meant by USDC as a “platform,” his two-part answer was instructive.  The first part focused on USDC’s application programming interface (API), which provides outside programmers open access to coding tools and data to ingest into their programs. That was consistent with the classic idea of a tech platform/protocol that encourages outside software development to grow overall value.  But then Allaire turned to the dollar itself, describing it as the established value “standard” for the internet. His idea was that the U.S. currency, now expressed in “programmable” form via USDC and other dollar-based stablecoins, can become its own “extensible platform.”  Read more: Circle Expands USDC Stablecoin to Five New Chains, Unveils Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol  This got me thinking about the wider notion of “protocol” beyond its software-specific meaning. At their core, protocols are agreed sets of rules by which independent parties engage with each other. They provide a standardizing function vital to commerce and society generally. They are integral to civilization and come in many forms.  A language, for example, is a protocol. When two people converse using the English protocol, they tacitly agree that the objects they’re sitting on are “chairs.” But if they switch to Spanish, the seats are “sillas.” Neither word is right or wrong in a natural sense. They are made up. But by agreeing to commonly use the rule, we enable communication. (It’s no coincidence software code can be written in different “languages.”)  Money is also a made up concept. It’s an agreed reference for measuring and referencing a benchmark of value. In this sense, it is a protocol.  The dollar is the most successful value exchange protocol in history. And if, as Allaire says, that standard can flourish in an open-source, permissionless software environment, it will foster an explosion of new ideas and applications, along with massive value creation, just as the internet’s permissionless, global extensible platform did.  Read more: How Does USDC Work?  Yes, but …  Count me in as sold. I think this thesis is correct.  And it’s one U.S. lawmakers should seriously consider. When weighing competing proposals for regulating stablecoins, they must recognize that if they leave the development of digital dollars up to government, via a central bank digital currency (CBDC), they will get nowhere near the innovation and value creation that a global community of open-source developers will unleash with stablecoins. With the U.S. worried about losing a digital arms race to a Chinese-Russian alliance, it can spread U.S. interests by encouraging such an ecosystem.  But something that’s in the U.S. government’s interests is not necessarily in the world’s interest.  For one, as the activist and author Brett Scott reminded me during a fireside chat at NEARCon, the global expansion of dollars equates to a loss of sovereignty in other places. Foreign local populations will lose control over their money supply, with credit conditions instead determined by Washington. One could argue that a hyper-dollarized financial internet is a form of U.S. digital colonialism.  And, while I agree with Allaire’s analysis of how to align U.S. interests with the latest financial innovations, we must be careful of putting too much power in the hands of a few private corporations like Circle. We made that mistake once with Web2.  Circle talks a good game in its lobbying efforts, encouraging open stablecoin competition, and I think we can take that, for now at least, in going ood faith. But as we’ve seen from how Google, Amazon, Facebook, et al. have doubled down on their extractive, privacy-abusing business models, despite a growing public outcry, any successful stablecoin company will face relentless profit-maximizing pressure from shareholders to carve out anti-competitive positions.  I think both of those problems can be addressed if U.S. lawmakers apply both an international approach and competition-promoting principles. Is there a model, for example, that allows communities outside the U.S. – be they national or local – to forge new tokenized expressions of value that give them agency over their resources and economic futures? (I’m particularly interested in nature-backed digital currencies such as those created by Single Earth to incentivize the protection of biodiversity and carbon sinks in developing countries.)  Also, to truly unleash the power of platform innovation with digital dollars, we must loosen the access constraints created by Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules and reduce U.S. banks’ transaction surveillance powers. Create freer access to dollars among the world’s financially excluded and amazing things will happen.  Circle’s vision contains the possibility of a radically redefined global financial system, overcoming the abuses of an incumbent one that’s increasingly proving to be broken. But that vision must be framed within thoughtful, inclusive and human-first principles.",POSITIVE,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | USDC,Michael J.

42394712,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASV1ta,1664552508,"Don’t Penalize Crypto in Banking Rules, Futures Industry Group Says","Plans to cap banks' holdings of bitcoin (BTC) could undermine the goal of financial reforms aimed a preventing a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, an influential group representing the futures industry intends to tell the international standard-setters at the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.  The Futures Industry Association (FIA), whose members include financial giants such as Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, said it was protesting to the committee about the likely impact of those plans.  The Basel committee, which sets requirements to ensure banks don't take on more risk than they can afford, set out its ideas in a consultation paper published in June. The proposals could prove crucial to the take-up of crypto by traditional financial institutions.  “Without clarification the proposed framework would undermine consensus post-crisis reforms and discourage banks from facilitating the central clearing of crypto-asset linked derivatives,” the group said in a statement published on its website Friday.  The result would be to “limit the risk-reducing effect” provided by using central clearinghouses for derivatives trades. It would also limit banks' ability to mitigate risks using financial instruments in a practice known as hedging, the statement added.  When contacted by CoinDesk, a representative of the FIA said the statement had been posted in error, and that no submission has yet been sent to the Basel Committee. At the time of writing the statement still appeared on the FIA’s website.  An original June 2021 plan from the Basel Committee, which told banks to issue $1 in capital for each $1 of crypto they hold, drew a volley of criticism for being too conservative, effectively ruling out any incentive to get into crypto markets. A later iteration, published one year later, gave some ground to crypto fans by recognizing the impact of hedging, but also imposed a cap on total exposure to unbacked crypto assets like bitcoin.  In a separate document also posted on the FIA website Friday, the European Principal Traders’ Association (EPTA) said the cap, set at 1% of a banks' core capital, “will prevent many institutions from entering the market for crypto assets at all,” suggesting that the limit be withdrawn, significantly increased, or disapplied for its members. EPTA is an FIA affiliate representing market participants who buy and sell securities on their own account.  The FIA is also working with other industry associations to argue that bringing crypto – and the distributed ledger technology it’s based on – into traditional finance will aid stability, allowing bank clients to benefit from greater efficiency and transparency, it said.  A study published by the Basel Commitee earlier Friday suggest that banks' crypto holdings are as little as 0.01% of their total risk exposure, focused on client services like custody and clearing.

Eco recently notified users of the planned move in a message and said new terms for conversion must be accepted by Oct. 24. Account features will be suspended if users don't agree to the terms.  Eco’s USDC trials date back to 2020 when the company was in beta mode and Andy Bromberg took over the reins at the company. In July of last year, Eco raised $60 million to propel its high-yield USDC savings app.  That round was led by private equity firm L Catterton and Activant Capital, Bromberg told CoinDesk at the time. Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Lightspeed Venture Partners, LionTree Partners and Valor Equity Partners also chipped in.

42394716,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASV1xW,1664546993,"First Mover Americas: Bitcoin to Post Sixth Straight September Loss, but LINK and UNI Manage Gains","Price Point: September has been a historically bad month for bitcoin, which posted losses for the last five years. Is October's record better?  Market Moves: Bitcoin's bullish seasonality might be muddled by the continued slide in the USD Liquidity Index.  Chart of the Day: Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase's stock (COIN) debuted on Nasdaq in April 2021. Since then, the share price has been in a steady downtrend.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was trading flat on the day after a choppy week of price movement. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value has traded in a range of $18,500-$20,380 over the week. After a painful week for both equities and government bonds, both markets posted modest gains.  Historically, September has been a bad month for bitcoin, with the crypto showing negative returns in each of the last five years. The string continued in 2022, with bitcoin lower by 2.95% for the month at press time. October, however, has a better historical record, with bitcoin posting gains in seven of the last nine years.  Ether (ETH) was also trading flat on Friday at around $1,337 and has lost 13% over the month.  Managing gains in September were the token of decentralized oracle network Chainlink (LINK), which advanced 17%, and Uniswap’s UNI which was up 6%.  “For Chainlink, the narrative that’s driving price performance is the partnership with SWIFT on a cross-chain interoperability protocol,” said Nauman Sheikh, head of treasury management and derivatives at Wave Financial, in an interview with CoinDesk.  “For UNI, it’s the continued growth in market share and volume along with being regarded as a long-term deep value play,” said Sheikh.  Caution is warranted, though, suggested Sheikh. “Given the macro environment, we can expect these outperforming tokens to quickly succumb to profit-taking, especially if bitcoin and ethereum begin to sell off more aggressively,” he said.  CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported XRP and MKR, (the governance token of the peer-to-peer lending platform Maker), are rallying in an otherwise quiet crypto sector as markets await the release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of U.S. inflation: the core personal consumption expenditure index (PCE).  In other news, Spain’s largest telecom company, Telefónica, invested in local crypto exchange Bit2Me and will begin accepting crypto for payments.  Meanwhile, a study by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision finds the world's largest banks are exposed to about 9.4 billion euros (US$9 billion) of crypto assets.

The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is a broad-based index designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of the digital asset market subject to minimum trading and exchange eligibility requirements.  Market Moves  Bitcoin's Bullish Seasonality Muddled by Continued Slide in 'USD Liquidity Index'  By Omkar Godbole  October has been a good month for bitcoin (BTC) and traders may be looking forward to capitalizing on the bullish seasonality, having seen the cryptocurrency hold steady through recent traditional market turmoil.  Bitcoin has put in a positive performance in October in eight out of the past 12 years, with an average return of around 30% according to historical data sourced from charting platform TradingView. In other words, October has generated positive returns 66% of the time.  However, one indicator tracking the U.S. dollar liquidity calls for caution on the part of the bulls.  The so-called USD Liquidity Condition Index has slipped to a 19-month low of $5.7 trillion, according to chart provided by TradingView.  ""The Fed net [dollar] liquidity is falling off a cliff, a clear headwind for crypto asset prices,"" Lewis Harland, a researcher at Decentral Park Capital, said in a daily market update.  The index assesses the degree of dollar liquidity based on the interaction of three factors – the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, the Treasury General Account (TGA) and the reverse repo balance held at the New York Fed.  The liquidity declines when the Fed's balance sheet contracts, the TGA and repo balances rise. On the contrary, an expansion of the Fed's balance sheet and a decline in the TGA and repo balances indicates an uptick in the dollar liquidity.  Read the full story here.  Chart of the Day  COIN Raises a Bear Flag  By Omkar Godbole  Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase's stock (COIN) debuted on Nasdaq in April 2021. Since then the share price has been in a steady downtrend.  Recently, a bear flag has emerged on COIN's daily price chart, hinting at a potential move lower.  ""We remain cautious of the bear flag in COIN,"" Rob Ginsberg, senior analyst at Wolfe Research, said in a technical analysis note to clients. ""A breakdown through channel support seems more than likely.""

The new rules set out by the National Agency of Perspective Projects (NAPP), the Ministry of Finance and the State Tax Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan are already in force. How much a firm will have to pay each month depends on the type of service it provides as well as a base figure set for crypto companies at the time the monthly payment is to be made, the document says.  Crypto exchanges have to pay 120 million Uzbekistani soums ($11,000) an NAPP spokesperson told CoinDesk. The document also lays out proportionally smaller payments required from cryptocurrency stores, custodial services, mining pools as well as individual miners.  The central Asian country is cracking down on the local crypto industry. A crypto regulation framework published in April mandated crypto exchanges, custodians and mining pools operating in the country to register with regulators. In August, the country moved to block crypto exchanges like Binance, Huobi, FTX and Bybit, saying local regulations did not allow citizens to trade crypto on foreign platforms.  According to the new rules, 80% of the monthly fees paid by crypto users and companies will go to the country's budget, while the rest will go to the treasury of the NAPP.  Companies that fail to pay the new fee will face penalties including the suspension of their licenses, Forklog said.

Blowfish will allow wallet providers and custodians to offer users real-time warnings and human-readable transaction context, according to an announcement shared with CoinDesk.  Fraud in crypto and the broader Web3 environment not only hurts the confidence of investors but also makes it harder to attain support from the mainstream financial world, such as institutions and regulators. As such, firms offering services that can prevent fraud should be able to attract healthy capital from investors. Earlier this month, fraud-prevention startup Sardine raised $51.5 million in Series B funding led by venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).  Blowfish, which is already available on the Solana, Ethereum and Polygon blockchains, plans to use the funding to expand to new systems and upgrade its fraud-detection engine. Web3 refers to a version of the internet that's based around decentralized platforms, blockchain technology and digital currencies.  One of Blowfish's clients is Solana-based wallet provider Phantom, with whom it has been working since April.  Phantom was one of wallet providers targeted during a hack that drained nearly $6 million from over 9,000 wallets in the Solana ecosystem last month. Following a weeklong investigation, Phantom said that it had found no vulnerabilities in its systems. Solana developers said it was likely that a bug in the code of closed-sourced wallet Slope may have been responsible.

42394717,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASV1vY,1664537136,"Cryptocurrencies XRP, MKR Shine as BTC, ETH Hold Steady Ahead of US Inflation Data","Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP and MKR, the governance token of the peer-to-peer lending platform Maker, are rallying in an otherwise moribund crypto market awaiting the release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of U.S. inflation: core personal consumption expenditure (PCE).  XRP traded recently at around 50 cents, representing an 11% gain over 24 hours, and MKR changed hands at $775, up 7%, according to CoinDesk data. Market leaders bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) traded little changed near $19,500 and $1,340, respectively.  XRP has been a ""court case play"" this month, outperforming the broader market in hopes that the long-drawn-out legal tussle between Ripple Labs, a San Francisco-based company with close ties with the cryptocurrency, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, will be resolved soon.  On Sept. 29, a U.S. District Court Judge ordered the release of documents about a 2018 speech by the then-Director of the SEC's division of corporation finance, William Hinman, bringing cheer to the XRP community.  In that speech, Himnan said ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, was not a security – a comment Ripple Labs seeks to use as a defense against the SEC's charge that Ripple violated securities law by raising $1.3 billion through XRP sales to investors between 2013 to 2020. Ripple plans to argue that if the regulator didn't consider ether as a security back then, how can it subject XRP to securities law? The SEC filed the suit against Ripple in December 2020.  XRP moved above a multimonth bear-market trendline early this month and was trading above its 200-day moving average at press time.  MKR's move to a three-week high comes a day after Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of crypto exchange Gemini and a longtime crypto investor, submitted a proposal on the Maker forum to boost the adoption of the Gemini dollar (GUSD) stablecoin in the latter’s ecosystem.  Winklevoss proposed a three-month marketing incentive plan, under which Gemini would pay a fixed annual interest of 1.25% on the total GUSD balance in MakerDAO's vault.  Focus on core PCE  The Core PCE released by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis gauges the average amount of money consumers spend on goods and services each month. It excludes volatile components like food and energy, and is considered to provide a better understanding of the underlying demand-pull inflation than other figures, like the consumer price index.  The Core PCE for August, scheduled for release at 12:30 UTC, is likely to show a 0.5% month-on-month rise, taking the year-on-year rate up to 4.7% from July's 4.6%, according to Reuters estimates sourced from FXStreet.  A higher-than-expected reading would imply stickier price pressures and a more challenging inflation fight for the Fed, weakening the case for a meaningful bounce in the battered risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  ""Remember that, according to the Fed's quarterly economic projections, the central bank expects this inflation measure to drop to 4.5% by the end of this year. Even that drop to 4.5% will require Fed Funds being taken into the 4.25-4.50% range, according to the Fed,"" ING's global head of markets Chris Turner, wrote in a note to clients. The Fed's target range is currently 3%-3.25%.

42394704,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASV1li,1664536689,Elon Musk Was Mulling Creating a Blockchain-Based Social Media Firm Before Offering to Buy Twitter,"""I think a new social media company is needed that is based on a blockchain and includes payments,"" Elon Musk said in a text message just days before he offered to buy Twitter (TWTR) for $43 billion back in April.  The controversial acquisition, which has since fallen through, prompted Twitter to file suit against the Tesla (TSLA) CEO in an attempt to force his hand. Musk is due to face a deposition in October, but a series of texts sent and received by the billionaire released on Friday shed some light on what was going on leading up to the offer and what may have led to him scrapping the deal.  The text messages spanned 40 pages and the six months between January and June. The messages involve a number of public figures and entrepreneurs – from angel investor Jason Calacanis and American television personality Gayle King to controversial podcast host Joe Rogan – hyping the acquisition offer and gushing over the billionaire's plans for the social media platform.  Musk offered to buy the social media platform because he believed it failed to protect free speech and therefore threatened democracy. Text message exchanges in the days leading up to the acquisition announcement reveal Musk envisioned blockchain as a potential solution to Twitter's free speech problem.  ""I have an idea for a blockchain social media system that does both payments and short messages/links like [T]witter. You have to pay a tiny amount to register your message on the chain, which will cut out the vast majority of spam and bots. There is no throat to choke, so free speech is guaranteed,"" Musk said in a text message to his entrepreneur brother Kimbal Musk on April 9.  Read more: Musk Sees Logic for Twitter as a Crypto Payments Platform  Twitter on a blockchain  In March, before Musk's own blockchain musings, he received a text message from philosopher and author William MacAskill, who said tech entrepreneur and founder of crypto exchange FTX Sam Bankman-Fried was also ""potentially interested in purchasing"" Twitter to make it ""better for the world."" MacAskill then shares SBF's number should Musk be interested in discussing a ""joint effort in that direction.""  Musk replied: ""Does he have huge amounts of money?""  The text messages that followed indicate SBF may have spoken with Musk in early April before Musk expressed interest in incorporating blockchain to a social media platform to his brother Kimbal Musk.  On April 9, Kimbal replied saying he has ""dug deep on Web3"" and its ""voting powers are amazing and verified."" Voting rights could ""crowdsource"" kicking scammers out, Kimbal said, referring to another reason why Musk wanted to buy the social media platform – to rid it of bots and scammers.  ""Blockchain prevents people from deleting tweets. Pros and cons, but the let the games begin!"" Kimbal said to Musk who had also called for Twitter to allow messages to be edited after being posted.  Kimbal also suggests exploring a native digital token for Twitter that users will have to hold in a wallet to be able to post messages. The token ""doesn't have to be expensive,"" Kimbal said, adding ""it will grow over time in value.""  Read more: SEC Calls 9 Cryptos 'Securities' in Insider Trading Case  The deal dies  On April 9, on the same day that Elon Musk was mulling a blockchain social media network, he texted Bret Taylor, chairman of Twitter's board of directors, telling him to expect an offer to take the company private. He messaged Taylor after Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal asked Musk to stop tweeting.  Although Twitter founder Jack Dorsey appeared to be supportive of Musk's takeover offer, things quickly soured between Musk and Agrawal. Through April, Dorsey attempts to smooth things over, even saying he wants to make sure Agrawal does ""everything possible to build towards"" Musk's goals until the deal is closed. But by the end of the month, things appeared to have worsened.  ""At least it became clear that you can't work together. That was clarifying,"" Dorsey said to Musk on April 26, referring to Agrawal, to which Musk replied, ""Yeah.""

The international standard-setter is considering new rules for the capital that lenders must hold against innovative assets.  The exposure, mainly client services involving bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), represents 0.14% of the total exposure to risk from the 19 banks who sent in data, or just 0.01% across all banks, and the survey – the first of its kind – is set to have a clear impact on policy.  “The template [sent to banks] was specifically designed to support the Committee’s two consultative documents on the prudential treatment of banks’ crypto asset exposures, which were published on 10 June 2021 and 30 June 2022,” the study, penned by Renzo Corrias of the Committee’s Secretariat, said.  Corrias was referring to two documents in which the Basel Committee – a grouping of national regulators that sets safety norms for banks designed to avoid 2008-style financial crises – tentatively set out tough rules that would govern how banks can get into crypto.  The plans set a tough capital requirement for unbacked currencies like bitcoin and ether as well as algorithmic stablecoins. The planned regulations could restrict lending and mean that, in practice, banks don’t have as much incentive to get into those markets. Lighter rules would apply to hedged exposures and other kinds of asset-pegged stablecoin.  Read more: Banks’ Bitcoin Holdings Should Be Capped, Basel Committee Proposes  The great majority of exposures are bitcoin and ether or instruments based on those two currencies, the study said. The figures are dominated by services banks provide for others, such as custody, clearing, and market making. Only a handful of banks are fully involved in directly holding or lending crypto.  But with only a small number of banks replying and assets heavily concentrated in a couple of those institutions, the results may not provide an accurate picture, Corrias warns.  “While they are helpful in providing a broad indication of banks’ crypto asset activity, they should interpreted with a degree of caution,” the study said.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/30/banks-crypto-asset-holdings-may-be-just-001-of-total-risk-exposure-basel-study-finds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/415a7bdef7400b32782f32ba34cb6d6a8e0771d7-8256x5504.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

GUSD in MakerDAO PSM Tyler Winklevoss, the co-founder of Gemini, presented the plan on Thursday and included a three-month marketing incentives schedule. Dune Analytics dashboard states that the initiative intends to boost the quantity of the Gemini dollar sum in the MakerDAO PSM (Peg Stability Module), which is now at approximately $24 million. By exchanging any MakerDAO-accepted collateral, users can mint DAI using the peg stability module. The PSM helps preserve DAI&apos;s peg to the dollar. The plan indicates that Gemini would pay a fixed interest annually of 1.25% on the whole amount of Gemini dollar maintained in the PSM vault as part of the program. The annual fixed charge would be assessed and charged monthly. The average GUSD value in the vault must be over $100 million on the last day of the month for the payment to be executed. Users are depositing GUSD to mint DAI, as evidenced by the GUSD volume in the vault reaching $100 million. Know-Your-Customer (KYC) Verification According to the plan, Gemini would pay MakerDAO in GUSD every month for three months. Maker would have to establish a new organization for this incentive.

42394736,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASV3tY,1664527658,Bitcoin's Bullish Seasonality Muddled by Continued Slide in 'USD Liquidity Index',"October has been a good month for bitcoin (BTC) and traders may be looking forward to capitalizing on the bullish seasonality, having seen the cryptocurrency hold steady through recent traditional market turmoil.  Bitcoin has put in a positive performance in October in eight out of the past 12 years, with an average return of around 30%, according to historical data sourced from charting platform TradingView. In other words, October has generated positive returns 66% of the time.  However, one indicator tracking the U.S. dollar liquidity calls for caution on the part of the bulls.  The so-called USD Liquidity Condition Index has slipped to a 19-month low of $5.7 trillion, according to chart provided by TradingView.  ""The Fed net [dollar] liquidity is falling off a cliff, a clear headwind for crypto asset prices,"" Lewis Harland, a researcher at Decentral Park Capital, said in a daily market update.  The index assesses the degree of dollar liquidity based on the interaction of three factors – the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, the Treasury General Account (TGA) and the reverse repo balance held at the New York Fed.  The liquidity declines when the Fed's balance sheet contracts, the TGA and repo balances rise. On the contrary, an expansion of the Fed's balance sheet and a decline in the TGA and repo balances indicates an uptick in the dollar liquidity.  The Fed kicked off its tightening cycle in March early this year and has raised borrowing costs by 300 basis points since then. The central bank is likely to hike further, taking the benchmark interest rate to 4.7% in the coming months. Further, the bank is reducing its balance sheet size at a monthly pace of $90 billion.  Since 2021, major bitcoin price tops and bottoms have coincided with local peaks and troughs in the dollar liquidity index, as Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of crypto spot and derivatives exchange BitMEX, detailed in the Aug. 23 blog post while calling bitcoin, ""a high powered measure of USD liquidity.""  With the dollar liquidity index slipping to a new year-to-date low, the odds appear stacked against bitcoin chalking out gains in the seasonally bullish month of October.  ""It may be a final straw that broke the camel's back,"" Harland wrote, referring to a possibility of a final capitulation slide in bitcoin in the wake of a continued tightening of the dollar liquidity.  Bitcoin changed hands at $19,630 at press time. Since Sept. 21, buyers and sellers have been unwilling to lead the price action, leaving the cryptocurrency rangebound between $18,000 and $20,000.

Mashinsky said Celsius is still owed $439 million from Equities First.  The creditors are seeking information regarding the loan agreements between Celsius and Equities First, any transfer of cash or crypto between Celsius and the lender, and also the reason behind Equities First's inability to pay back the $439 million collateral to Celsius.  Celsius was one of the crypto firms to collapse due to the market downturn earlier this year and has been struggling to pay back its creditors. The lending firm was looking at a number of ways to payback its debt, including IOU (“I Owe You”) tokens and selling off its stablecoin holdings.  On Thursday, Texas state agencies raised objections to Celsius' plan to sell off the stablecoin holdings. The potential stablecoin sale is scheduled for a hearing on Oct. 6 in New York.

Over the last 24 hours, Algorand has gained 2%, which means that ALGO is stuck in consolidation. In the past week, ALGO moved up by 3%. This also signalled that the altcoin hasn&apos;t made significant upward movement on the chart. The technical indicator of the altcoin showed that the bulls were still in control. The buyers were still more than sellers, but the technical outlook also pointed out that the bulls would soon fizzle out in the market. The demand for ALGO had slowed down, indicating that sellers would soon take control, bringing the price of the altcoin down to its next support level. The support zone for the altcoin stood between $0.33 and $0.27 respectively. The demand for the altcoin has been dropping, which means that the coin will move near the $0.31 price mark. Algorand Price: One Day Chart ALGO was trading for $0.34 at the time of writing. The coin was trading in a descending channel from which it broke out, but it was unable to add further fuel to its price owing to lower demand. The immediate resistance for the coin stands at $0.40 and a push above that could help the bulls to stick around for longer. On the other hand, the local support for the coin stood at $0.31. A fall from the $0.31 level will bring ALGO down to $0.27.
