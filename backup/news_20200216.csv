While the number of Bison Trails users is, according to Bunin, headed ""up and to the right,"" he addressed concerns with Libra and the recent drop-out of major banking and business players.      In short? He's not worried.      We spoke to Bunin at ETHDenver where he described the company's view on Libra.      ""I mean, honestly, I don't know about specific companies or individuals,"" he said. ""But I think one thing that I can say is that Libra was always very ambitious and it's very hard. It's not right for everyone all the time. And I think that I have the utmost respect for everybody that joined and everybody that left. I just see people doing what was right for them.""      He added: ""We really believe in the vision. Honestly.""      Bunin described Bison Trails' philosophy as very grounded and mindful. To that end, he said the company didn't jump into Libra just because of Facebook.      ""When we joined the Libra Association, it wasn't like, 'Oh, hey, Facebook is doing something, let's join.' It's really about what difference we're making in the world. This is going to be hard. This is going to be potentially scary for us because we're a younger company.

42404000,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhBeI,1581858944,Privacy Laws Are Only as Effective as the Companies Implementing Them,"Privacy is a hot topic for legislators all over the world.      Democractic presidential candidates have privacy laws and regulations in their campaign platforms. Amy Klobuchar discussed a tax on companies who share user data. Elizabeth Warren has introduced legislation that considers the idea of jail time for CEOs over privacy failures. Before he dropped out of the race, John Delaney proposed the U.S. adopt a law similar to the California Consumer Privacy Act, which gives greater agency to consumers when it comes to limiting companies collecting of their data.      Voters are demanding action. A recent poll from Morning Consult found 79 percent of registered voters said Congress should pursue a bill to better protect the online data of consumers, while 65 percent called data privacy one of the biggest issues facing society.      The European Union, 27 member states with the loss of the UK, enacted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), enshrining the idea that people have control over personal data. California recently enacted its own privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which goes into effect January 1. The law empowers California consumers to know when private companies collect, share or sell their data and to stop that sale if necessary. It applies to companies with annual gross revenue of more than $25 million or that possess information on 50,000 or more consumers.      But laws can have unintended consequences. Sometimes the very laws meant to enforce privacy can result in companies nevertheless sharing it. GDPR opens up a way for crooks to impersonate people and get their data from companies.      A year after GDPR went into effect, researchers in the EU showed how it’s easy to access personal data from companies.      “This isn’t a problem with the law itself, but instead with the companies and organizations implementing it,” Mariano Di Martino, one of the researchers, who is a PhD student as Hasselt University in Belgium, told CoinDesk in an interview. “This may be because of budgetary constraints or maybe it’s because they don’t understand the risks of this data.”      One group used publicly available information, such as names, emails and phone numbers, in addition to more complicated methods to request information on their research partners from 55 companies under GDPR. One of these complex methods for obtaining the data included replacing the name, birth date and photo on the image of an ID to reflect the person whose information the researchers wanted. Of those 55 companies, 15 companies gave up sensitive personal information to the researchers. Four companies never responded to their data requests, in clear violation of GDPR.    This isn’t a problem with the law itself, but instead with the companies and organizations implementing it.    The information they gathered included financial companies giving up details such as ID card numbers, a list of timestamped financial transactions, customer IDs, telephone numbers and place of birth, and transportation and logistic companies releasing locations people visited in the past as well as routes they’d saved.      Another team of researchers in the EU found similar issues when one requested information on his research partner and the research partner’s wife using a spoofed email account that was a variation on the name of the wife. About a quarter of the 150 companies and organizations they contacted gave up sensitive personal information without verifying the identity of the requester. The information given to him included everything from her social security number to her high school grades and various account passwords.      As the CCPA goes into effect, it’s possible we may see similar issues. The GDPR research illustrates that privacy laws may only be as good as the companies affected by them. Which is scary. These leaks have real-world implications.      “Say I was trying to stalk someone and I want to learn more about them,” says Di Martino. “I might send a data request to a company that provides taxi or bus services and try to get all the routes or GPS locations where this person has been. And it could work.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/02/16/privacy-laws-are-only-as-effective-as-the-companies-implementing-them,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a4dc4ee688fa884f6ec627d717f2ceba03fcdfbc-1500x977.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404008,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhBmA,1581844807,Mind the Gap: Why ETH Price and DeFi Adoption Aren't in Sync,"In his 1991 book, ""Crossing the Chasm,"" management consultant Geoffrey Moore defined a crucial gap between the early adopters of a new technology and the larger populations of users that come later. Decentralized finance (DeFi) may now be approaching a gap of its own.      This article focuses on DeFi services that allow deposits of ether (ETH), ethereum’s native asset, as collateral for loans issued in a dollar-pegged stablecoin, DAI. Lending is decentralized to the extent it is managed by an open network of participants, governed by rules and incentives established in a computer program. Borrowers may deposit these stablecoins to earn income, convert them to cash or use them to make leveraged investments in ETH and other crypto assets.      DeFi lending’s gains are impressive, but their relationship to the ETH price bears watching.      Demand for DeFi lending services built on ethereum shows a pattern of inverse relationship to the price of ETH. When ether prices are falling, the amount of ETH locked in DeFi tends to rise. Most recent data indicate the relationship operates the other way, too. (Data is from DeFi Pulse via Concourse Open.)      If this apparent relationship persists, it may indicate a circular user adoption of DeFi lending that could be limited to a small percentage of the number of existing ETH holders. That is, existing DeFi lending offerings may not be sufficiently attractive to cross the chasm and draw new users into ethereum.      The early adopter in this analysis is the long-term holder of ETH, motivated by conviction that ETH’s value will increase in the future. For such investors, DeFi lending offers a way to earn income or free up capital, as outlined above.      Some of these uses, such as income-earning deposits and cash conversions, may accelerate during dips in price, explaining the apparent inverse pattern between ETH price and ETH locked in DeFi lending. A declining price increases the cost of selling under duress.      Leveraged buying is a possible exception, and proponents of DeFi lending point this way. “What DeFi is creating is a virtuous cycle where investors who have higher risk tolerance are locking up ETH to generate Dai and leverage long ETH,” Mariano Conti, head of smart contracts at MakerDAO, told CoinDesk Research.      Currently, Maker, the largest DeFi lending operation by ETH deposits, has a minimum collateralization ratio of 150 percent, meaning $150 worth of ether is required as collateral to borrow $100 worth of DAI. The leverage implied by this ratio is 1.67X.      Liquid derivatives markets like BitMEX, Huobi and OKEx offer up to 100x leverage on crypto assets including ETH. With these options before them, how many long-ETH investors are likely to choose DeFi lending as a means to leveraged trading?      It’s also difficult to envision adoption among a wider market of borrowers not yet initiated into crypto investing. Would a Main Street borrower purchase ETH in order to obtain a cash loan worth less than said ETH? Perhaps, if DeFi lenders could accept non-crypto collateral. This would not be a trivial development.      “I see lots of startups playing with identity type solutions to reduce collateral requirements, but I think these are a long ways out from meaningfully impacting the market,” Kyle Samani, managing partner of Multicoin Capital, told CoinDesk Research. “There are a lot of hard, intertwined problems to make this work.”      (CoinDesk discussed the issue with Samani and Jordan Clifford of Scalar Capital in a live webinar on crypto lending, held in December. You can sign up to view it here.)      As for that inverse relationship between ETH price and ETH deposits in DeFi lending, if it persists it may indicate the category is approaching an adoption limit. If the inverse relationship is broken or reversed, that may signal DeFi lending has indeed found a set of use cases capable of bringing it, and ethereum, to a wider market.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | MKR | TRADING,Galen Moore,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/16/mind-the-gap-why-eth-price-and-defi-adoption-arent-in-sync,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c5fb7b25e999bc218dfe8635c0c32ef928a25e81-1502x902.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
