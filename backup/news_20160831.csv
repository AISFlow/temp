42427064,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJysVh,1472667028,Deloitte Spin-Off Nuco Partners on Blockchain IoT Project,"Distributed ledger startup Nuco has inked its first formal partnership since being spun out from Deloitte's FinTech team earlier this year.  The deal with Terepac Corporation has resulted in what the companies are calling the ""Terepac Blockchain"", a distributed ledger designed to allow manufacturers to follow the entire life-cycle of their products, as part of what is known as the Internet of Things (IoT).  While Nuco continues with its original goal of building products designed to make it easier to launch industry-wide blockchain consortia, the partnership provides the first evidence of where that effort might eventually lead.  Nuco co-founder Kesem Frank told CoinDesk:  ""The Internet-of-Things is actually a great example because it’s less about the velocity of transactions and it is much more about volume. To actually establish a platform according to different skills, you need to apply different thinking to the system level.""  By tailoring different functionality based on corporate and industry-wide demands, Nuco believes it can further optimize the benefits of a distributed ledger.  In this first partnership, Terepac describes its blockchain, as ""an immutable, tamper-proof, record of all device interactions"". The blockchain is designed to record object-specific data about the past and present states of a wide range of products.  Founded in 2016, Nuco was originally a component of Deloitte's Rubix blockchain offering, but was moved outside the firm in order to scale its operations more quickly.  Blockchain and IoT  In addition to being a step for Nuco, however, the partnership is also the latest sign the IoT industry is beginning to explore blockchain more seriously.  Cisco, for example, published a report projecting in June of this year that machine-to-machine (M2M) connections that comprise the IoT will grow from 4.9bn in 2015 to 12.2bn by 2020, representing nearly half (46%) of total connected devices.  To provide increased customer service to the owners and manufacturers of those objects, Terepac Corporation was founded in 2005. But with increased attention being given to blockchain tech, the company's potential services have changed, according to Terepac’s founder and CEO, Ric Asselstine,  In interview with CoinDesk, Asselstine said that he initially only wanted to create a more efficient way for the manufacturers of objects to service those goods long after they were purchased.  But as he's been working with Nuco his vision has changed.  Asselstine said:  ""We don’t know all the relationships and or value that can be formed from deploying blockchain technology. While I didn’t originally foresee this as an opportunity to be that charismatic leader in the space, the potential of the Terepac Blockchain is absolutely there.""

42427062,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJysTh,1472661022,Bank of Canada Paper: Bitcoin Adoption Could Stabilize Price,"The central bank of Canada has published a new working paper that suggests its researchers believe digital currency exchange rates will become less volatile should adoption increase.  Penned by researchers Wilko Bolt (of the central bank of The Netherlands) and Maarten RC van Oordt (of the Bank of Canada’s Financial Stability Department), the paper offers a possible ""economic framework"" for exchange rate analysis. Published on 18th August, it further represents the latest work from a major central bank, following growing interest from this segment of the financial community in recent months.  The authors explore factors influencing digital currency exchange rates, which they write include existing demand for payments, the day-to-day moves of market speculators and the belief among some buyers about future mainstream adoption.  Ultimately, they conclude major price swings brought on by traders could subside if digital currencies see broader use for payments.  The authors note:  ""Our model predicts that, as a virtual currency becomes more established, the exchange rate will become less sensitive to the impact of shocks to speculators’ beliefs and their inflow into and outflow from the virtual currency market. This prediction undermines the notion that the current high volatility of the exchange rates of virtual currencies will prohibit their widespread usage in the long run.""  Later in the piece, the researchers assert that digital currencies with a ""fixed supply"" are likely to behave more like commodities than currencies, and that current exchange rates are potentially ""a symptom of early development"" – one that could potentially go away depending on how usage evolves.  ""The future will show how much volatility will drop,"" they conclude.  Work continues  The paper represents another step in the Bank of Canada's work with the technology, which has seen it comment on issues surrounding digital currencies over the past two years while at the same time exploring blockchain applications.  Earlier this summer, the Bank of Canada drew headlines when it unveiled a pilot project for a central bank-issued digital currency – an initiative that mirrors other work being undertaken at institutions like the Bank of England.  The bank has explored the impact of the technology in the past, with one senior official speculating in a speech last November that bitcoin could lead to ""a new dynamic in the global monetary order"" in which central banks ""struggle"" to carry out policy initiatives.

42427073,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJysph,1472651581,Japan Exchange Group: Distributed Ledgers 'Better' With Third Parties,"A new report from financial giant Japan Exchange Group (JPX) contends that distributed ledgers will work ""better"" when applied to capital markets if third parties are involved.  The finding comes from a 27-page working paper, released yesterday, in which JPX offered insights into its proof-of-concept efforts, as well as the key takeaways from its experiments. For JPX, the report is the latest product of its deepening interest in blockchain, following a partnership with IBM announced in February.  Given that the bitcoin blockchain was designed to remove third parties from online transactions, the proposition that derivative technologies will be more effective without this feature is likely to emerge as a controversial one.  Still, JPX’s report argues that it's necessary for financial institutions to pursue this architecture as a means of guarding against the risk that blockchain data is accessible to other financial institutions who might be using a shared ledger.  The report reads:  ""Considering these concerns or business requirements, it is preferable that all stored data is only accessible by related parties. Since this will lose the feature of ownership certification by public trust, nobody can validate his/her claim of securities ownership. Therefore, full data access privilege needs to be given to a trusted third party who is responsible for the ownership certification.""  JPX revealed that during its proofs-of-concept, central securities depositories played the role of a certification authority, a system that it believes will be as secure as the decentralized version employed by the bitcoin blockchain at scale.  Other entities that could come to facilitate blockchain transactions include regulators and IT vendors, it said.  The authors go on to assert that having a third party will also mitigate the risk of settlement failures, arguing it could mediate situations between buyers and sellers in which gridlock emerges due to the lack of a promised delivery.  The statements are the latest that find major financial institutions grappling with the question of how to gain the speed and efficiencies of shared ledgers without offering full transaction history to all participants.  As noted by leading analysts, this issue, whether real or perceived, has emerged as a pressing question that may be holding back larger adoption of distributed ledger tech.  Replicating bitcoin  Yet even as the paper finds JPX offering a more narrow definition of a distributed ledger for enterprise firms, it was effusive in its praise for how the bitcoin blockchain has applied advances in cryptography to finance.  For example, the authors said that while the bitcoin blockchain featured what they referred to as ""well-defined parameters"", they noted that DLT is not yet a comparable technology in terms of its development stage.  Still, the report went so far as to label distributed ledger technology as ""extremely attractive"" for infrastructure uses, citing its immutability and resistance to system failure, as well as its ability to enable a shared ownership registry.  ""On top of these technological features, redesigning the business process by exploring DLT would bring industry-wide efficiencies including financial service innovation or broader cost reduction,"" the report reads.  The report evaluates six aspects of DLT including its applicability to capital markets, throughput, consensus process, data privacy, availability and cost.  JPX sees clearing and settlement as the layer it considered ""the most important use case"", as it could make existing workflows ""more efficient"", while the firm said it believes other use cases, such as trading or reconciliation, would be more problematic.  Call to action  Elsewhere, JPX sought to indicate that it remains committed to investigating and expanding its support for distributed ledger applications despite challenges ahead.  One of the primary reasons, according to the report, will be the cost savings it believes financial institutions can achieve by changing the existing business processes with DLT. The report asserts that DLT could come to reduce hardware, software and maintenance costs.  The paper uses this observation as a call to action, with JPX voicing its commitment to participate in more technology trials as an infrastructure operator.  The authors concluded:  ""Unlike bitcoin, which has been operating since 2009, DLT application in capital market infrastructures has rarely been investigated and needs further experiment and enhancement until it matures to be a fundamental technology of capital markets.""

42427042,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJylDh,1472646667,Insurance Giant MetLife Joins R3 Blockchain Consortium,"In the latest sign that the insurance industry is embracing blockchain and distributed ledgers, MetLife has announced it will join banking consortium R3CEV.  With the news, MetLife follows life insurance firm AIA and China's Ping An Insurance as notable members of its industry to join the initiative, launched in September of last year. Other major insurers that have expressed interest in the technology more generally include John Hancock and Allianz France.  In statements, MetLife voiced its enthusiasm for joining the initiative, which has in the past conducted trials with groups of major financial institutions, including those focused on trade finance and commercial paper trading.  ""R3's work has proven how blockchain technology can disrupt how business is done today,"" Marty Lippert, executive vice president and head of MetLife's global technology and operations organization, said.

42427058,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJyljh,1472645184,What Will Be Bitcoin's Next Big Price Event?,"For the price of bitcoin, the summer was anything but smooth.  Markets boomed on news of 'the Brexit', tapered off through the long-awaited halving and tumbled on the news yet another exchange had been hacked. Since then, the price has fluctuated between $550 and $600, returning to the ""relative"" calm observed earlier in the year.  But given bitcoin's historical volatility, analysts are already beginning to question what may trigger bitcoin's next big price swing.  As we head into the fall and winter months, a diverse set of theories are beginning to emerge about conditions that could either boost the price, or see it return to its 2015 lows.  Institutional approval  Among the potential triggers cited by analysts, the emergence of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), an investment vehicle that generally tracks a basket of stocks or commodities, was perhaps the most often discussed.  Many market observers have been watching the status of two proposed ETFs with great interest, but for a while, there wasn't any reason to hope for developments. However, excitement for a potential market first has grown in recent weeks following the July announcement of the SolidX Bitcoin Trust and amid new filings by the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust.  The approval of either could represent a milestone for the bitcoin community, analysts say, as the ETFs would enable authorized participants to issues shares tied to real bitcoin holdings, which could be a catalyst for new liquidity.  Daniel Masters, director of Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund (GABI), noted recently that many commodities have enjoyed sharp increases in price and more robust trading activity once ETFs based on the underlying assets hit the market.  He wrote in an August blog post:  ""From the early 2000s onward, there was a proliferation of ETFs covering all manner of commodity interests. In each and every case – for gold, silver, oil, natural gas, platinum, copper and even indices – the advent of the ETFs led to higher prices, more trading volume of futures and cash exchanges and higher levels of commodity futures open interest.""  Should either ETF receive approval, bitcoin could enjoy a notable increase in liquidity. It was this variable that Du Jun, co-founder of Chinese exchange Huobi, singled out as potentially driving the digital currency's price higher.  ""Bitcoin's liquidity depends on the future of bitcoin's value and investors' expectation to a large extent,"" Du said.  Technical improvements  Yet another potential boost for the bitcoin price could come in the form of a long-awaited resolution to the ""scaling"" debate.  Currently, blocks of transactions on the bitcoin blockchain have a storage size of just 1MB. As this puts a limitation on the number of transactions the network can process (and therefore, some argue, adoption), there has been a sometimes messy and contentious drive in the community to change it.  But due to the tricky specifics of how a change to this hard-coded limit would need to be enacted, no consensus has yet been reached. Still, that doesn't mean solutions aren't on the way, the most notable of which is Segregated Witness (SegWit), an upgrade that recently saw a preliminary code release.  While promising for the network, though, analysts seemed less enthusiastic about SegWit’s potential impact on bitcoin prices.  Cryptocurrency investment fund manager Jacob Eliosoff, for example, said investors have likely already priced in the coming change as it was announced in December and originally expected to be deployed in April.  ""SegWit's release seems too gradual and widely expected (not to say overdue) to really bump the price,"" Eliosoff said.  Tim Enneking, chairman of investment manager EAM, struck a similar tone, adding:  ""I don’t think SegWit will have anything more than an incremental and marginal impact on BTC prices, at least in the short term.""  Post-Halving pressures  In one of the more unique claims, investor and entrepreneur Vinny Lingham singled out the halving of rewards on the bitcoin network as a potential influence.  The prediction may be surprising given that a planned technical change the reduced the mining reward from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC took place earlier this summer, largely without fanfare.  But while bitcoin prices experienced little change this July, Lingham asserts its true impact has not yet been felt. In the next two-to-four weeks, forces resulting from the shift could cause the digital currency to surge, he said.  As detailed in a recent post, miners who aren't turning enough profit, he contends, may soon be forced to buy bitcoin from exchanges, an event he said was likely to trigger a ""short squeeze"", or a sharp increase in the price based on the lack of available supply.  He wrote in May:  ""It’s the same as selling crops in the futures market and then being hit by a storm that wipes out half of your fields. The only way, technically, that this doesn’t happen, is if the price doubles on halving day (it won’t).""  Financial (in)stability  Finally, some predicted bitcoin's next major price event would be dependent on the stability of the global financial system.  Traders have repeatedly flocked to the digital currency in times of crisis, leading many market observers to label it a risk-off asset or even a ""digital gold"" that appeals during times of economic stress.  In the past, bitcoin has benefitted from situations such as the 'Brexit', as well as during periods of economic volatility in Greece and Cyprus.  It remains debatable how much of these increases is based on real capital flight, but there is still widespread belief that such events could come to be a powerful influencer going forward.  Huobi's Du spoke to this matter, telling CoinDesk that when the global financial system experiences volatility, investors will ""look for more safe-haven investments"" like bitcoin.  Another variable remains government responses to the digital currency. If major countries accept bitcoin, analysts said, it will affect both the currency's trading activity and value.
