42416606,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulVoNj,1646090959,First Mover Asia: The Petroyuan Is No Russia Sanctions Buster; Bitcoin 15% Gain Is Largest in a Year as Investors See Opportunity for Crypto,"Good morning. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening:  Markets: Bitcoin, ether and other major cryptos rise, even as the U.S. looked to hamstring Russian from using crypto to evade sanctions.  Insights: CBDCs won't help Russia evade economic sanctions.  Technician's take: BTC's 11% price jump reflects short-term bullish activity, although upside appears limited.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $43,040 +14.9%  Ether (ETH): $2,902 +12.1%  Top Gainers  ` Asset Ticker Returns Sector Internet Computer ICP +17.0% Computing Solana SOL +16.3% Smart Contract Platform Cosmos ATOM +14.7% Smart Contract Platform`  Top Losers  There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Bitcoin soared more than 15% at one point, even as Russia escalated its war against Ukraine, pounding the country's capital Kyiv and its second-largest city, Kharkiv, with rocket fire. The gain was bitcoin's largest single-day increase in a year. Ether rose over 12% and other major cryptos were firmly in the green.  Observers of the conflict initiated by Russian President Vladimir Putin fear the nearly 200,000-strong invading force that was bloodied by surprisingly strong Ukraine resistance last week will resort to more brutal tactics. Russia and Ukraine delegations adjourned their initial peace talks on the Belarus border without resolution to report back to their governments as European and U.S. sanctions began to bite into the Russian economy.  Earlier in the day, Ukraine Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov asked ""all major crypto exchanges to block addresses of Russian users."" Europe and the U.S. have banned certain Russian banks from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), the messaging network supporting global financial transactions. The move has blocked these institutions from conducting any interbank transactions with non-Russian entities. Russia has viewed crypto as a way to circumvent this sanction and others meant to isolate them from the global financial system.  Oanda Americas Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya wrote in an email that investors on Monday viewed the move and counter-move as ""bolstering the argument for blockchain products that will compete with the SWIFT network. Bitcoin and all the top altcoins are rallying today as investors realize the likelihood of massive investments into [decentralized finance] following the latest round of Russian sanctions.""  At the time of publication, bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading at just above $43,000, its highest level since mid-February. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was trading at about $2,900 and following a similar pattern.  In a phone interview with CoinDesk, Moya added: ""No one is saying DeFi hasn't been around for a while. This might help accelerate more people focusing on it. Whenever there's a significant military conflict historically it's a risk-off opportunity. Investors are asking 'where else can I put my money.' This is looking like one those smart bets. This (DeFi) could take off faster than expected.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,373 -0.2%  DJIA: 33,892 -0.4%  Nasdaq: 13,751 +0.4%  Gold: $1,909 +1.1%  Insights  CBDCs will not help Russia evade sanctions  Banks worldwide have committed to freezing Russia out of SWIFT. The U.S. Treasury Department slaps a prohibition on U.S. entities interacting with Russia‚Äôs central bank. Foreigners are barred from the Moscow stock market for fears of sell-offs. Russia‚Äôs ruble tanks.  The headlines came fast and furiously Monday as sanctions placed on Russia by Western powers started to bite the country‚Äôs economy hard.  Predictably this also led to many hot takes on how this was the first sign of U.S. dollar hegemony cracking with central bank digital currencies (CBDC) being used to break the sanctions blockade.  Some observers of the Russian invasion predicted the rise of the petroyuan as an alternative currency for crude oil transactions. They see Russia transacting in renminbi to avoid sanctions.  Problem: The yuan isn‚Äôt freely convertible. China's central bank maintains strict capital controls over the currency capping overseas transfers at the equivalent of $50,000 per annum. The strictness of compliance checks has only increased since former U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs trade war put a chill on China‚Äôs economy.  And it‚Äôs not that the People‚Äôs Bank of China wants the yuan to be freely convertible anyway. China‚Äôs currency trades within a controlled band, which its extensive foreign reserves support, making banks assume more reserves to cool a rallying yuan, or burn through them to support the band when times are tough. (Taiwan does something similar, but is sneakier about it.)  So a rapidly internationalizing yuan is something that China doesn‚Äôt want, politically. While Beijing might begin to discuss loosening control of the currency in the future, the yuan isn‚Äôt set up for complete liberalization of the capital account.  The policy behind the digital yuan (eCNY) reflects as much.  ‚ÄúThe internationalization of a currency is a natural result of market selection. The international status of a country‚Äôs currency depends on its economic fundamentals and the depth, efficiency, and openness of its financial markets,‚Äù reads the project‚Äôs white paper.  The U.S. dollar isn‚Äôt under threat because there isn‚Äôt a versatile alternative that has its liquidity. Other nations also don‚Äôt want their currencies to be internationalized because their economies aren‚Äôt big enough to support such a move, and these nations do not want to cede control to outsiders.  In a post Sunday, Bloomberg columnist Andy Mukherjee theorizes how the eCNY could be used to help Russia break through sanctions and dislodge the dollar, suggesting the eCNY could be traded for stablecoins.  Yet, such a scenario wouldn‚Äôt work because the People's Bank of China (PBoC) has not indicated that it would allow the eCNY to exist offshore. But the proposal is also amusing because it replicates something that already exists: the digital currency used for international transactions including between Russia and China, isn‚Äôt the yuan but dollar-denominated stablecoins.  As it's been said before, the best thing for continued dollar hegemony is crypto. There isn‚Äôt a viable alternative, which makes it an effective weapon for sanctions.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Rises Past $40K; Resistance at $43K and $46K  Bitcoin (BTC) broke above the $40,000 price level on intraday charts, indicating short-term bullish activity. The cryptocurrency was up about 11% over the past 24 hours, although immediate resistance around current levels could stall the upswing.  The two-week long downtrend registered a downside exhaustion signal on Feb. 24, per the DeMARK indicators, which typically precedes brief price rallies. Still, long-term momentum indicators are negative, pointing to limited upside around the $43,000-$46,000 resistance zone.  For now, BTC will need to remain above the 100-day moving average on the four-hour chart, currently near $40,000, to confirm upside targets. Lower support is seen at $37,000, which could stabilize pullbacks into the Asia trading day.

It saw the hash rate from the region which was once termed the mining capital of the world crumble to almost zero as miners had to shut down their operations. The reason for this from the Chinese government boiled down to concerns about electricity consumption and environmental impact. As the miners exited China, they had to set up business elsewhere and procure electricity for their mining farms, which can be quite energy-intensive. According to a new report, these new energy sources have been mainly from non-renewable sources compared to what the miners used in China. This means that the energy impact of bitcoin mining has gone up in recent months. Bitcoin Mining Carbon Footprint Now Worse It has been less than a year since China placed a ban on bitcoin mining and the effects are already being felt energy-wise. The general school of thought following the ban had been that miners would focus on more renewable energy sources so as to avoid a repeat of the issues in the region. However, a new study has shown that this is not so. Rather, the environmental impact of bitcoin mining has only gotten worse.

Biden will unveil a new four-pronged strategy to combat rising costs, which have dragged down his support ratings. As consumer frustration hits back at the White House, Democrats are terrified about losing their legislative majorities in this fall&apos;s midterm elections. The four-point plan includes producing more goods in America and strengthening supply chains, lowering the cost of everyday expenses and reducing the deficit, promoting fair competition to lower prices, assisting small businesses and protecting consumers, and removing barriers to well-paying jobs, according to officials.

The ministry is reaching out to Coinbase, Binance, Huobi, KuCoin, Bybit, Gate.io and Whitebit, along with Ukrainian exchange Kuna, according to a list shared with CoinDesk.  The letters are being sent after Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's vice prime minister and minister of digital transformation, on Sunday night asked all major crypto exchanges to block addresses of Russian users.  Global crypto exchange Binance told CoinDesk that it had no plans to unilaterally ban Russian users from the platform.  ""However, we are taking the steps necessary to ensure we take action against those that have had sanctions levied against them while minimizing impact to innocent users. Should the international community widen those sanctions further, we will apply those aggressively as well,‚Äù a Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk.  The U.S. Treasury on Monday morning moved to add regulations to thwart the evasion of sanctions by Russians as the country continues its aggression toward Ukraine. The new regulations prohibit the ""deceptive or structured transactions or dealings to circumvent any United States sanctions, including through the use of digital currencies or assets or the use of physical assets.""

Coinbase said its ""mission is to increase economic freedom ... A unilateral and total ban would punish ordinary Russian citizens.""

Talks between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators could continue over the next few days, although some officials said so far no deal on a cease-fire has been reached, according to the Wall Street Journal  Meanwhile, the U.S. and several European nations have imposed more sanctions on Russia. For example, on Monday, the U.S. Treasury Department prohibited transactions with the Central Bank of Russia and placed sanctions on a key Russian sovereign wealth fund.  In crypto markets, trading volumes between the Russian ruble and bitcoin increased to a nine-month high, according to data tracked by Kaiko. The rise in ruble-denominated bitcoin volume prompted a backlash from one Ukrainian official.  ""I'm asking all major crypto exchanges to block addresses of Russian users,"" Mykhailo Fedorov, vice prime minister of Ukraine and minister of the country's digital transformation, tweeted on Sunday. ""It's crucial to freeze not only the addresses linked to Russian and Belarusian politicians, but also to sabotage ordinary users.""  Bitcoin's trading volume across major exchanges has declined after the Feb. 24 spike, and selling pressure is starting to fade.  Further, data from Glassnode shows a large portion of BTC held by investors at around the $60,000 price level has found new buyers at the $35,000-$38,000 price range.

Bitcoin has been in a downtrend since its all-time high in November of nearly $69,000, well before the Russia-Ukraine conflict. That means other factors such as global monetary tightening, regulatory uncertainty and lower crypto demand from China have weighed on prices.  Still, cyclical downturns in bitcoin eventually phase out given the cryptocurrency's long-term uptrend.  On average, the S&P 500 takes about 47 days to recover from geopolitical-driven sell-offs, according to data from Swissblock Technologies, a crypto analytics firm. Other studies show that equities continued to advance in three to six months after geopolitical-driven sell-offs. BTC could follow a similar recovery pattern given its rising correlation with the S&P 500.  The chart below shows bitcoin's market-value-to-realized value ratio (MVRV), standardized to show extreme upside and downside moves. Simply put, the ratio provides an estimate of bitcoin's deviation from ""fair value.""  The MVRV entered overvalued territory at around BTC's November all-time price high, but wasn't as extreme relative to the 2018 peak. That suggests the current down cycle won't be as severe as the previous bear market's 80% peak-to-trough decline.  Still, geopolitical events are highly uncertain, and the MVRV hasn't reached undervalued territory. That could point to additional price volatility over the short term.

What The Current Global Situation Tells Us,"Bitcoin has felt the consequences of war, just like the rest of the world. The current geopolitical situation generates uncertainty for both households and markets. The question of a million dollars for bitcoin seems to be whether it can still work as a hedge against inflation or has February proven the opposite.

42416602,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulVoE6,1646081188,Russia Sanctions Present ‚ÄòDramatic Testing Moment‚Äô for Crypto Exchanges,"The sanctions placed on Russia following the Ukraine invasion present a ‚Äúdramatic testing moment‚Äù for governments and the cryptocurrency industry to prevent misuse of the technology, a compliance expert said.  ‚ÄúGeopolitically, crypto is now center stage in the conversation,‚Äù said Liat Shetret, director of regulatory affairs and compliance policy at Solidus Labs, a compliance software vendor. ‚ÄúThat has not been the case before.‚Äù  The situation thus presents ‚Äúa test for crypto that‚Äôs really going to affect future growth.‚Äù Shetret said Monday in an appearance on CoinDesk TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúFirst Mover.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a dramatic testing moment.‚Äù  The worry is that Russian oligarchs will try to use cryptocurrency to get around the sanctions. But the exchanges belonging to the Crypto Market Integrity Coalition, formed by Solidus and others earlier this month, stand ‚Äúwilling and able‚Äù to prevent such actors from cashing out their crypto, Shetret said.  ‚ÄúThis is really the pressure point,‚Äù she said, since sanctioned individuals and entities would usually need to convert crypto to fiat currency in order to spend it.  Crypto exchanges are actively monitoring their transactions using blockchain tracing and market surveillance, she said. And in doing so, they are trying to assess and create an evidence trail for potential illicit transactions.  Shetret's comments come as the U.S. Treasury Department formally warned crypto exchanges not to facilitate transactions for individuals and entities newly added to its sanctions list.  That said, Shetret did not sound overly concerned about Russia using crypto as an alternative to SWIFT if the West kicks Russian banks off the interbank messaging system as announced. ‚ÄúCrypto infrastructure is not yet as mature as we‚Äôd like it to be for it to take on the bulk of the Russian economy,‚Äù she said. Russia‚Äôs central bank digital currency (CBDC) is ‚Äúnot quite there‚Äù as a sanctions-evasion tool either, she said (the Bank of Russia just started testing the digital ruble this month).  See also: Humans Are the Last-Mile Problem of Bitcoin Crowdfunding | Opinion  Eswar Prasad, Tolani Senior Professor of Trade Policy at Cornell University, gave a similar assessment. He acknowledged that cryptocurrencies offer some benefits in a crisis, such as a better option than a plunging domestic currency or as a conduit for capital flight, but said risks linger. ‚ÄúThe reality is that they do not provide a reliable and scalable workaround for a national government to bypass the international monetary system,‚Äù he said by email.  Echoing Shetret, Prasad said the need to ultimately convert cryptocurrencies into more widely accepted global currencies to make international payments means that they have limited traction in evading financial sanctions.  While cryptocurrencies are garnering support at unprecedented times, Prasad said, ‚Äúthey cannot in any significant way prevent a country's currency from collapsing in value relative to major reserve currencies since those values are determined in formal financial markets.‚Äù  Crowdfunding warfare  Cryptocurrency‚Äôs prominent role in the Ukraine crisis is also a wake-up call for governments around the world to learn and regulate the technology, Shetret said.  Following Russia‚Äôs invasion, the Ukrainian government and private actors ‚Äì including a distributed autonomous organization, or DAO ‚Äì have raised millions of dollars‚Äô worth of aid in crypto, with at least some of that paying for military equipment.  ""This is something new: bringing in crypto actors, non-state actors, to crowdfund warfare,‚Äù Shetret said. ‚ÄúThis is a new form of geopolitical complexity that we just haven't seen before.‚Äù  When asked about the long-term implications of this new form of financing war, Shetret acknowledged that ‚Äúit could turn ugly.‚Äù However, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm opting to see it as an opportunity for governments to really step into the light on crypto.‚Äù  ""Governments at this point in time really have no choice but to wrap their minds around crypto, to have clear policies, clear enforcement capabilities,‚Äù she said. ""There's simply no way for governments to bury their heads in the sand.""  And if they engage, they will find crypto firms cooperative, Shetret said. ‚ÄúThe industry is ready to work with governments to make sure that policies are crisp, clear and compliant to achieve the goals of financial integrity.""  On the bright side, Ukraine and its supporters asking for funding in bitcoin and ether means the funds can be traced on a public ledger, she said. ‚ÄúThat makes life easier because you can see how the funds will be used, where they‚Äôre going and where they‚Äôre going to get cashed out.‚Äù  Daniel Kuhn contributed reporting.",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/28/russia-sanctions-present-dramatic-testing-moment-for-crypto-exchanges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e166e16f8df38e7546eddbedf92102fd5c0cf4ca-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In another Discord announcement, the pseudonymous Syber said he was a 21-year-old male named Martin.

42417134,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS6fVd,1646079614,How Tax Protesters Set Off the Bitcoin Revolution,"Lord, the revenue man is ridin', boy, you'd better look out  ‚ÄúWhen I get a new piece of certified mail from the IRS, my heart skips a beat,‚Äù admits Lincoln Rice. ‚ÄúEven though intellectually I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs probably no big deal, that fear is so ingrained in us.‚Äù  That‚Äôs a big admission for Rice, whose job is, essentially, to help more people get angry letters from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. He‚Äôs the coordinator (‚ÄúIf we were a normal nonprofit, my title would be something like Director‚Äù) of the National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee, a group that shares resources for Americans who don‚Äôt want their tax dollars to support the military or warmaking.  This piece is part of CoinDesk's Tax Week.  ‚ÄúA lot of [early] war tax resisters ‚Ä¶ were conscientious objectors to the Vietnam War, and were either recognized as such by the federal government, or did stints in prison,‚Äù says Rice. After the war, ‚Äúmany of them started thinking, ‚ÄòI might not be asked any longer to participate in war with my body, but I don‚Äôt want to pay for it, either.‚Äô‚Äù  Some are willing to go so far as to break the law to withhold their support from the U.S. war machine. ‚ÄúSome folks do an illegal form of tax resistance,‚Äù Rice says, ‚ÄúWhere they ‚Ä¶ refuse to pay all of their federal income tax and redirect it to more life-sustaining purposes.‚Äù  The group is following in a proud American tradition of tax-based political activism. The Boston Tea Party, which helped spark the American Revolution, was a violent protest against ‚Äútaxation without representation,‚Äù following the British imposition of unfair taxes on paper and tea. Samuel Adams, considered one of America‚Äôs Founding Fathers, was active in tea smuggling intended to evade the hated duties. In 1846, Henry David Thoreau was thrown in jail for refusing to pay taxes, partly out of opposition to the Mexican-American War. The experience spurred him to write ‚ÄúCivil Disobedience,‚Äù a key text in the evolution of American (and later global) activism.  In contemporary America, groups have continued to advocate for various forms of tax resistance or tax protest, with different rationales and approaches. Rich individuals and corporations bob and weave their way through the tax code to make sure they‚Äôre paying the least they can legally get away with. Also working within the law, modern mainstream conservatism supports low-tax policy, embodied for decades by the ‚Äúno new taxes‚Äù pledge that conservative activist Grover Norquist pushed on Republican candidates who didn‚Äôt want to face a primary challenge from his allies. For decades, far-right precursors to the so-called ‚Äúsovereign citizen‚Äù movement have used (often questionable) legalistic reasoning to argue that the U.S. income tax is already illegal or unenforceable.  Then there are the libertarians. Libertarian tax resistance is often philosophically radical and can manifest as a refusal of the ideas of citizenship, collective action and even ‚Äúsociety‚Äù itself. Libertarians often equate taxation with theft or worse, arguing the private sector can and should provide most of the services the government does today.  Those anti-tax and anti-government attitudes were a major factor in perhaps the single most important moment in the brief history of cryptocurrency. As early as 2011, a small group of libertarians associated with the New Hampshire-based Free State Project began to wonder if cryptocurrency, which is very hard to seize and was at the time hard to trace, could provide a technological means for protecting their wealth from involuntary government seizure.  That seems less plausible than it did a decade ago. But in the meantime, Free Staters helped kick-start awareness of bitcoin, arguably more than any other single group. They‚Äôve taken major hits for it, including a recent wave of bitcoin-related arrests of hardline libertarians. They have been the conduit for crucial figures including Roger Ver and Eric Voorhees ‚Äì though also for the considerably less laudable Craig Wright.  With tax time fast approaching, many American cryptocurrency investors and traders are bracing themselves for the onerous task of calculating how much they owe the IRS ‚Äì then the equally burdensome act of paying it. More than a few will find themselves pondering a dangerous question:  What if I just don‚Äôt pay the IRS?  Read More: Avoid Crypto Tax Headaches: What You Need to Know if You Bought or Sold Crypto in 2021  How common is tax resistance?  The tax landscape in America is essentially unique among developed democracies, in two seemingly contradictory ways. On the one hand, the American tax system relies more than others on self-reporting and voluntary compliance.  ‚ÄúU.S. war tax resisters are envied by resisters in other places like Canada or Europe,‚Äù says Rice. ‚ÄúWe get to fill out the W-4 [tax withholding form] to tell our employer how much to withhold from our paycheck and send to the IRS ‚Äì no other western country allows that.‚Äù Most other Western countries determine withholding for citizens, and often essentially prepare taxes for them. This means Americans have much more ability to refuse or otherwise avoid taxes.  Strangely, America‚Äôs second unique feature is that its citizens voluntarily pay their taxes at a higher rate than any other country on Earth. About 83% of Yanks pay their taxes voluntarily and on time, according to the IRS. That makes Americans almost shockingly compliant compared to some places: One 2012 study by the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies found only about 62% of Italians comply with personal income tax laws voluntarily. Even more stunning, only about 68% of Germans do.  Rice said compliance is largely thanks to fear of the IRS. But Americans on the whole also seem surprisingly happy to pay taxes. Starting in the late 1990s, the percentage of Americans who feel they personally pay too much in taxes has declined dramatically. One 2017 study found that 76% of young Americans believed ‚Äúeveryone or almost everyone‚Äù should pay taxes.  Alejandro Zentner, an economist who studies taxation at the University of Texas at Dallas, offers an explanation that‚Äôs both sensible and shocking: Despite decades of growing distrust, Americans still have much higher than average faith in the honesty of government.  ‚ÄúIn the United States, when people protest their taxes, they do it because they don‚Äôt like the actions of the government,‚Äù such as fighting wars, says Zentner. But ‚Äúa lot of people in [countries like] Argentina argue for not paying their taxes because of corruption. Which is kind of a different driver. They feel that the government is collecting this money and organizing parties.‚Äù  Bitcoin and taxes  Cryptocurrency, for better or for worse, is inextricably and forever bound with tax resistance. Taxes weren‚Äôt a major focus for Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto ‚Äì the word ‚Äútax‚Äù does not appear in the Bitcoin white paper, and Satoshi‚Äôs various writings were generally more focused on Bitcoin as a way to address currency debasement (or inflation) and banking-driven credit bubbles.  Read More: US Crypto Tax Year 2022: Inflation-Based Changes to Know  But a small cadre of hard-line, U.S.-based libertarians ‚Äì including Roger Ver, the first person to ever invest in a Bitcoin startup ‚Äì saw the huge potential of the technology before anyone else outside a small group of cypherpunks. This group played a role in articulating libertarian politics to Bitcoin technology, laying some of the most important conceptual foundations for the cryptocurrency explosion we‚Äôre living through today. This group of early Bitcoin adopters included at least a few outright ‚Äútax protesters,‚Äù who not only opposed taxation in principle, but actively and very publicly refused to pay their own taxes.  Ver first learned about Bitcoin when then-lead maintainer Gavin Andresen appeared on a podcast called ""Free Talk Live."" Ver was a longtime listener of the show, which was (and still is) produced by fellow travelers of the Free State Project, an initiative to establish a kind of laboratory for a libertarian social order in New Hampshire.  That single podcast episode (which isn‚Äôt easy to find online these days) triggered a Cambrian Explosion for Bitcoin evangelism and adoption. On the ground, bitcoin became widely used by members of the Free State Project, and in major Free Stater clusters such as Keene, NH. These events also led longtime libertarian Eric Voorhees to Bitcoin. He went on to found important early projects and companies like Satoshi Dice and ShapeShift.  Roger Ver took a more zealous approach, earning him the nickname ‚ÄúBitcoin Jesus‚Äù until the Block Size Wars left him somewhat marginalized. According to a number of Free Staters interviewed by Reason Magazine, Ver‚Äôs early advice helped make them millionaires. The impact even went beyond bitcoin ‚Äì Vitalik Buterin wrote exhaustively about the Free State Project for Bitcoin magazine, years before conceiving Ethereum.  Libertarians are broadly opposed to taxation and the state, in nearly all forms. But the Free State group has included folks who took the principles of anti-tax politics and put them into vigorous, even theatrical practice. Ian Freeman, the founder of ""Free Talk Live,"" recently claimed to New York magazine that he hasn‚Äôt paid federal income tax since 2004. That claim doesn‚Äôt necessarily imply lawbreaking given Freeman‚Äôs reportedly minimalist lifestyle ‚Äì some tax resisters intentionally live on incomes too low to tax. Freeman is currently under house arrest for bitcoin-related allegations that Free State allies, including Voorhees and Ver, have claimed are trumped up and politically motivated.  Also key to this early Bitcoin cluster was a woman named Michele Seven, who was an active tax protester before Bitcoin even launched. Seven spoke publicly as early as 2009 about her refusal to pay more than half a million dollars in back taxes and fines claimed by the IRS. Seven would go on to a position of substantial influence in the Bitcoin community; she proselytized Bitcoin for many years under the handle Bitcoin Belle.  Read More: The 7 Types of Crypto Tax Nightmares  Why Bitcoin?  The idea that Bitcoin‚Äôs pseudonymity could be used to hide wealth and avoid taxes was more realistic a decade ago than it appears today. The Free Staters pursued that goal with some tactical nuance, striving to build an ecosystem of bitcoin-accepting retailers to help isolate the system from the U.S. dollar and protect users‚Äô identities.  As libertarian magazine Reason recently pointed out, some who collected substantial bitcoin hoards early on have gone very quiet as their tokens became fortunes. This may be the surest form of tax avoidance available to crypto users: Once they‚Äôve mined or otherwise acquired tokens without linking them to a real-world identity, some users simply pretend the tokens don‚Äôt exist. Hence the ‚Äútragic boating accident‚Äù meme that continues circulating: If you‚Äôve ‚Äò‚Äòlost‚Äò‚Äô your coins, you certainly can‚Äôt be taxed on their rising value.  A second notional pillar of anti-tax enthusiasm for Bitcoin was the idea that bitcoin was currency, and therefore less legally taxable than conventional financial returns like capital gains in stocks. That concept was never particularly airtight, and was put to rest in 2014 when the IRS officially declared that it considered bitcoin property, not currency.  At a higher level, though, Bitcoin opens up dramatic new possibilities for shrinking the footprint of the state. Libertarianism (not alone among political ideologies) has always grappled with a degree of incoherence at its heart: while private property stands as its alpha and omega, a state has been historically necessary to protect private property rights through police and military force. These are the entities moderate libertarian thinkers like Robert Nozick generally have in mind when they leave space for a ‚Äúminimal state.‚Äù  Critics like Stephen Holmes and Cass Sunstein, though, claim this carveout also ‚Äúreveals the statist preconditions of laissez-faire, the authority that underwrites liberty.‚Äù And it gets worse. In a world with more and more intangible assets like stocks and patents, the state apparatus required to secure property rights grows. Suddenly you need not just the police, but intellectual property (IP) courts and securities oversight. By extension, you then need state taxation to pay for them.  Bitcoin, and blockchain more generally, present a chance to break that bind ‚Äì a completely non-state mechanism for securing intangible property. This is the driving ideological force behind systems like tZero, a now somewhat moribund early attempt to put corporate equity on the blockchain. TZero was built with the backing of Overstock.com and Patrick Byrne, a once-stalwart libertarian increasingly entangled in Trumpism.  ‚Äé‚ÄéThe implications for taxation were just one element of Bitcoin's appeal to libertarians, though. Its uncensorability, then on display on the Silk Road market, was arguably more magnetic for the Free Staters. And the biggest draw was and remains simply that bitcoin was non-state money. Libertarian icon F.A. Hayek argued in 1976‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Denationalization of Money‚Äù that separating money creation from the state could make all money better thanks to competitive dynamics ‚Äì an argument now common not just among bitcoiners, but across crypto. Libertarians circa 2011 were uniquely positioned to realize that bitcoin represented the first genuinely tenable non-state money thanks to its technological innovations.  Tax protest: A very convenient truthiness  ‚ÄúThey are not to blame; it‚Äôs their husband‚Äôs/wife‚Äôs, ex-wife‚Äôs/ex-husband‚Äôs, partner‚Äôs/ex-partner‚Äôs fault. Sometimes it‚Äôs their children‚Äôs fault. Most of the time it‚Äôs our fault, or Congress‚Äôs fault, or the President‚Äôs fault. Somebody, somewhere, is definitely to blame.‚Äù  In the early 2010s, Michele Seven was an occasional co-host of the ""Free Talk Live"" podcast, and reportedly played a role in turning Roger Ver and Eric Voorhees on to bitcoin. Extremely well-spoken and personable, Seven was by all accounts quite influential and well-connected in the early Bitcoin scene, and likely deserves a bigger share of credit for the system‚Äôs growth than she gets today. That is reportedly in part because of damage to her reputation over her role in introducing Craig Wright to influential bitcoiners.  But before making her huge impact on bitcoin, Seven was declaring her refusal to pay a large tax bill, saying she owed nothing because she was ‚Äúnot a slave.‚Äù Given Seven‚Äôs central role in a community widely seen as strongly principled, one part of her story is jarring: By her own telling, she did not refuse to pay taxes on principle, only articulating her politics to her unpaid taxes after what she herself describes as an oversight. Moreover, this seems to be a very common trajectory among individual tax protestors.  In an interview published in 2009 by the YouTube channel Motorhome Diaries, Seven describes having ‚Äúrecently received a notice that the IRS intended to place a levy‚Äù on her property, to collect a tax debt of over $637,000 incurred in 2006. Seven described that year as a hectic and trying time thanks to serious family illnesses.  ‚ÄúInitially, I didn‚Äôt file simply because I didn‚Äôt have time. It slipped my mind. And although I traded in the [stock] market, I realized that I hadn‚Äôt actually made enough money to have a tax consequence if it came down to it. I did not make the $1.5 million that the IRS is claiming I made that year, but rather $60,000.‚Äù  You may have guessed Seven‚Äôs mistake: She was an active day trader in stocks without a good tax strategy. Each of her winning trades incurred a tax obligation, but she instead kept that money and used it to trade more, with apparently modest success. Though seemingly unaware of this at the time, she was essentially using leverage provided by other Americans to trade stocks. And when leverage goes the wrong way, you can wind up, as she did, deeply in the hole to your lender.  Seven and other Free Staters come across by and large as clear-eyed and principled, genuinely willing to suffer serious consequences in service to their deep political commitments. But most tax protestors ‚Äì the term used by the IRS for those who dispute the government‚Äôs legal authority to tax ‚Äì follow a much less sophisticated version of Seven‚Äôs path. Declaring themselves philosophical tax protestors or sovereign citizens is often a post-facto rationalization of not paying tax debts they‚Äôve already incurred for entirely non-ideological reasons.  ‚ÄúThe vast majority of [tax protestors] are middle- to lower-class tradesmen with little or no college education,‚Äù former tax collector Richard Yancey wrote in his memoir about life as a ‚Äúrevenuer.‚Äù ‚ÄúMost protestors are merely gullible saps who have fallen on hard times and are conned by unscrupulous promoters into parting with money they don‚Äôt have for a ‚Äòproduct‚Äô that doesn‚Äôt work.‚Äù  Yancey was a tax collector mostly in the 1990s, and the ‚Äòproduct‚Äô he‚Äôs referring to is a relic of the pre-internet age. Grifters would target individuals who had already been hit with tax liens, trying to sell them ‚Äúsecret‚Äù methods to erase their tax debts. These usually included form letters purporting to eliminate taxes by invoking made-up legal principles, often some variant of the ‚Äúadmiralty law‚Äù conspiracy theory or specious ‚Äúsovereign citizen‚Äù logic. They didn‚Äôt work, and still don‚Äôt.  Rice at NWTRCC marks this as one major distinction between war tax resisters and legalistic ‚Äútax protesters‚Äù: ‚ÄúWe do view our actions as illegal, and as a form of civil disobedience,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd in our group there‚Äôs a large emphasis on redirection. It‚Äôs not so much an emphasis on, this is money that I earned and it should stay with my person. There is a sense of communal responsibility.‚Äù  Tax resistance and the burden of history  Though forms of tax protest and tax resistance have recurred throughout American history, contemporary small-government and tax-protest movements have been shaped by a specific context: the end of slavery and the struggles to integrate U.S. society. To a substantial degree, tax protest, elite tax evasion and anti-tax politics have been embraced by factions seeking to deny equal citizenship to African-Americans.  ‚ÄúYou can see these tax resistance policies overlapping with anxieties about the end of slavery,‚Äù says Camille Walsh, who studies conflicts over taxation and school funding. ‚ÄúDefense of the institution of slavery goes along with preventing the federal and state governments from having the power‚Äù to protect the rights of former slaves.  That story is long and tangled. But modern right-wing tax protest can be seen in part as a response to the limits of earlier attempts to equate ‚Äútaxpayers‚Äù with ‚Äúwhite people.‚Äù Walsh found that this rhetoric was widespread, for instance, in discussions of school integration in the 1950s. White opponents of integration often argued they had the ‚Äúright‚Äù to send their children to whites-only schools because their taxes paid for them.  When those bids for control did not entirely succeed in exerting white control of schools, growing numbers of white Americans simply turned their back on the social contract and the taxation that underpinned it. Activist and historian Heather McGhee has convincingly argued in her book ‚ÄúThe Sum of Us‚Äù that white Americans have been willing to give up tax-funded public goods simply to prevent them from being used by Black citizens. This included, most famously, allowing dozens of publicly funded municipal swimming pools across the American South to be closed and filled with concrete.  This racialized perception of taxation echoed as recently as 2012, when Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney was castigated for the racial undertones of his comments on Americans who don‚Äôt pay income tax. The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish organization, describes contemporary tax protest movements as still having ‚Äúsome white supremacist elements.‚Äù  The IRS in repose  If fear of the IRS has helped make Americans the world‚Äôs most dutiful taxpayers, that fear‚Äôs name might as well be William Culpepper. Culpepper is the pseudonymous, obsessive IRS revenue officer whose presence looms over Richard Yancey‚Äôs memoir ‚ÄúConfessions of a Tax Collector.‚Äù It is Culpepper who tries to teach Yancey, then a rookie IRS revenue officer, the merciless doggedness of the ‚Äúrevenuer,‚Äù a philosophy heavy on property seizure and light on human empathy.  ‚ÄúWe nullify,‚Äù Culpepper intones to Yancey. ‚ÄúWe confiscate. We obliterate. We take a bunch of numbers and make them go away ‚Ä¶ Your job is the black hole of occupations.‚Äù The nihilistic, even malevolent Culpepper is a mix of Agent Smith and The Terminator, but instead of a cyborg with a gun, he‚Äôs a sharp-dressed man with lien documents and the full power of the U.S. government behind him.  That image may still haunt many Americans ‚Äì but it‚Äôs largely a thing of the past. That‚Äôs thanks mostly to the 1998 IRS Restructuring and Reform Act, passed partly in response to allegations that taxpayers were being harassed by revenue officers a la Culpepper. The Act placed more oversight on revenuers and raised the bar for aggressive enforcement.  IRS funding and staffing have also been consistently constrained since the Act‚Äôs passage. According to Yancey, the IRS had 9,000 revenue officers when he was hired in 1991. By 2004, just a few years after the RRA, that number had already plummeted to fewer than 3,500. Between 2010 and 2020, overall IRS staffing levels dropped a further 20%. The Act and these staffing reductions had the predictable effect of dramatically reducing enforcement action, including property seizures ‚Äì even for those vocally declaring their refusal to pay taxes.  Read More: 4 Crypto Tax Myths You Need to Know  ‚ÄúNot only was there a change in funding, but a change in philosophy for the IRS,‚Äù said Rice. ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt be uncommon for people practicing illegal forms of war tax resistance in the 1970s or 1980s to have their car repossessed, to have their wages garnished. During the 1990s there were people who had their homes repossessed and put them up for auction. That has largely ended.‚Äù  The Act also included an interesting provision preventing the IRS from using the term ‚Äúillegal tax protestor.‚Äù As described by Yancey, tax protestors (particularly those of the sovereign citizen stripe) were often made examples of by the pre-reform IRS, singled out for particularly harsh enforcement to scare off imitators. Removing the term from the IRS lexicon was intended to change that, though the thinking still reportedly persists within the IRS.  Rice agrees that legalistic ‚Äútax protestors‚Äù are still subject to more aggressive enforcement than war tax resisters engaging in open civil disobedience. ‚ÄúI think the IRS feels they‚Äôll have a better image if they‚Äôre going after a tax protestor, who they can say has just been [avoiding taxes] for their own selfish needs.‚Äù  But those fine distinctions seem less important than the overall relaxation of enforcement. In addition to declining enforcement against delinquent taxes, the likelihood of any taxpayer being audited dropped by more than half between 2010 and 2020. Many believe that this decline has gone too far, and proposals to restore missing IRS funding have been floated in Congress, including recently as part of U.S. President Joe Biden‚Äôs now-dead Build Back Better package.  But until such changes become reality, it leaves a huge window for those who oppose taxation on principle, of whatever sort.  ‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt a better time‚Äù to resist or protest taxes, says Rice. ‚ÄúThis is probably the least effective the IRS has ever been.‚Äù  Further reading from CoinDesk's Tax Week  Lender Beware: The Potential DeFi Tax Trap  Uncle Sam may collect tax on every loan and repayment of cryptocurrency, which may catch users by surprise, creating a tax trap that could impair the rapidly emerging DeFi industry.

42416600,e264UAkMOkEShzxWulVo7g,1646075566,Why MOBI‚Äôs Blockchain ESG Tests Matter,"At first glance, the partnership of MOBI, a technology provider for internet-connected vehicles, with cloud computing trade group MEF, might look like just another big-ticket blockchain consortium play.  After all, MOBI, which stands for the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative, has been focused on building infrastructure for vehicles and internet-of-things (IoT) commerce for several years now, and it already accounts for a large slice of the global gross domestic product in terms of its automotive industry membership; MEF (originally known as the Metro Ethernet Forum) has been around since 2001 and includes most of the world‚Äôs large telecommunications firms.  But scaling up and standardizing MOBI‚Äôs so-called Integrated Trust Network (ITN) ‚Äì a combination of blockchain-based trust anchors, decentralized identity verification and digital twins of vehicles and components ‚Äì is yielding breakthroughs with the most compelling use case of all: saving the planet.  An example from MOBI‚Äôs stable of environmental, social and governance (ESG)-friendly use cases is the tracking of the tailpipe emissions from more than 280 million registered vehicles, carried out in a joint pilot program with the European Commission. (The Commission is soon to release a report on the trial.)  Measuring carbon emissions in the atmosphere accurately is notoriously tricky and has even been called the ‚ÄúParis Conundrum,‚Äù in reference to the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. The important takeaway from MOBI, which started out building on Hyperledger but is now ‚Äúblockchain agnostic,‚Äù is its demonstration that tailpipe emissions can be accurately measured on a suitably grand scale.  ‚ÄúIn most of the developed world, mobility is the largest source of carbon emissions,‚Äù MOBI co-director Chris Ballinger said in an interview. ‚ÄúAnd yet, nobody focuses on it, because it‚Äôs so dispersed. There‚Äôs no way to measure it accurately. The MEF brings the connectivity and the ability to message, transact, exchange. We‚Äôre bringing the ability to locate things in space and time with identifiers for decentralized objects and IoT.‚Äù  Digital twins  Its first standard, the MOBI VID, or decentralized identifier (DID), is a digital twin of a vehicle. DIDs enable verifiable digital identity in a manner that‚Äôs decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers and certificate authorities.  Read more: Microsoft‚Äôs Decentralized Identity Head Leaves to Join Square  A plethora of standards now exist for carbon accounting, usually developed in a siloed and non-cohesive way, explained MOBI co-director Tram Vo. Blockchain technology with its essential characteristics of consensus, immutability and track-and-trace, combined with digital identity standards, offers a solid foundation.  ‚ÄúSo essentially, for Web 3 commerce, everything needs a digital twin,‚Äù Vo said in an interview. ‚ÄúBut for that digital twin to be trusted, it has to be connected to a DID and then the whole ecosystem of verified credentials, and then you can do business.‚Äù  The MOBI system also features two channels where data is shared and broadcast, including a public channel that shows a digital twin anchored to the ITN and a private communication channel, dubbed Citopia, where smart contract-enabled business automation can happen.  Pay as you go  The trustless Citopia layer will explore the use of verifiable credentials to incentivize greener behavior, said Vo, including a pay-as-you-go approach to pollution, road congestion and so on.  This means that in addition to tackling the environmental component of ESG, MOBI is looking at ways to address the ‚ÄúG‚Äù or governance part of the equation, Ballinger said. It‚Äôs now possible to have the location of a vehicle tied to its identity as well as to a host of other data ‚Äì like whether it‚Äôs an electric vehicle or internal combustion, what its weight is, whether it‚Äôs traveling at a congested time, whether it‚Äôs a carpool, etc.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs $27 trillion of road infrastructure and no good way to finance it,‚Äù Ballinger said. ‚ÄúPay-as-you-go opens up a totally new source of public infrastructure finance that I‚Äôm convinced will be replacing the gas tax. Everybody‚Äôs looking at how to charge for roads and solve the infrastructure deficit. This is such a perfect solution.‚Äù",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/28/why-mobi-networks-blockchain-esg-tests-matter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f5d03d6f9437122072e1f131c09cdb9fd7cffd4-3000x2000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The &apos;all exchanges reserve&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin present on wallets of all exchanges. When the value of this indicator goes up, it means the supply on exchanges is rising as investors deposit their coins. Such a trend is usually bearish for the price of the crypto as holders usually transfer to exchanges for selling purposes. On the other hand, the reserve&apos;s value decreasing would imply that investors have been withdrawing a net amount of Bitcoin recently. This trend can prove to be bullish for the coin as it may be an indication of accumulation behavior.

42394280,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbCob,1646074224,Crypto Donations Are About More Than Censorship-Resistance,"In light of Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, humanitarian and military-adjacent organizations have received millions of dollars in charitable contributions from overseas ‚Äì a massive outpouring of international support for Ukraine‚Äôs resistance.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  And while (in most cases) fiat money remains a viable way to support Ukraine, a decent amount of the donations has come in the form of cryptocurrency:  The Ukrainian government has been soliciting crypto donations from its official Twitter account in the form of bitcoin, ether and the dollar-denominated stablecoin tether, according to the founder of Kuna, the Ukrainian exchange reportedly facilitating the donations. That money is being used to support evacuees and ‚Äúlocal military personnel‚Äù with drones, heat-vision goggles and gas. The blockchain analytics firm Elliptic reported that the Ukrainian government has raised around $14 million in crypto, so far.  A community-led fundraising effort called UkraineDAO has followed suit, organizing a non-fungible token (NFT) auction on behalf of a Ukrainian non-government organization called Come Back Alive, which was kicked off Patreon for violating the network‚Äôs terms of service. The crowdfunding platform said the organization was ‚Äúfinanc[ing] and train[ing] military personnel,‚Äù and Come Back Alive‚Äôs website promotes training programs for snipers. The NFT auction is ongoing, and has already raised over $3.5 million in ETH.  A brand new organization called RELI3F, spearheaded by prominent crypto influencers like Andrew Wang, raised over $1 million in ETH from a hastily assembled NFT collection. On Twitter, the group said it‚Äôs split about half of that money among Come Back Alive, ""local Ukrainian media vetted by [a local English-language news organization called The Kyiv Independent]"" and the Hospitallers medical battalion.  Individual investors and influencers have jumped in, too: Crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried gave $250,000 in tether, and Chain.com CEO Deepak Thapliyal donated 100 ETH, or about $277,000. Bankman-Fried also said his company, FTX, was giving $25 to every Ukrainian user.  Murat Pak, an NFT artist who recently said that politics ‚Äúbores‚Äù him, and that ‚Äúnone of [his] moves are political,‚Äù nonetheless claims to have donated $1.8 million in ETH ‚Äúto human rights‚Äù in Ukraine.  As always with crypto, shills and opportunists abound. Gavin Wood, founder of the cryptocurrency polkadot (DOT), suggested he would donate $5 million if the government promoted the token by ‚Äúpost[ing] a DOT address.‚Äù In other words, he would donate if the government would accept his token. A few days ago, Vice spotlighted a deeply tasteless but also probably well-meaning meme depicting a Bored Ape NFT expressing support for the people of Ukraine.  Apes aside, the question remains: Why crypto? It‚Äôs not as if there aren‚Äôt other ways to donate ‚Äì the Ukraine Twitter account posted information about direct money transfers with fiat currency, and Come Back Alive accepts contributions via the SWIFT-linked international banking system.  Ukraine, unlike Russia, has the support of the vast majority of the world. It‚Äôs Russia that‚Äôs lost some access to SWIFT, and it‚Äôs Russia whose banks and corporate sector are being aggressively sanctioned by Western governments (with notable exceptions being made for its oil conglomerates). Ordinary Russians, the vast majority of whom have nothing to do with this war, are now facing down potential bank runs as the ruble collapses.  See also: Ukraine's Quest to Become a Crypto Jurisdiction of Choice  You would think crypto would be more useful to Russians than to Ukrainians, except that, of course, digital currencies are often traceable and can be just as censorable as other currencies, depending on how they‚Äôre used, thanks to regulations on fiat on- and off-ramps.  My sense is that the reason for all the donations in ETH has to do with the broader buzz around crypto, and the habits already developed by investors and entrepreneurs in this sector. Fundraiser DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) are good at raising huge amounts of money extremely quickly. It‚Äôs not about ‚Äúcensorship-resistance‚Äù and instant transfers as much as it‚Äôs about keeping money in the system. If you‚Äôre already dealing with crypto on a regular basis, it makes sense to send your charitable contributions in crypto, too.  It‚Äôs problematic for a few reasons, one of which has to do with Ethereum‚Äôs ludicrously high gas fees ‚Äì you‚Äôre getting far less bang for your buck, when you donate with Ethereum than when you donate with fiat money.  There‚Äôs also the issue of wishy-washy middlemen: Why attempt a group auction via a DAO, or pick up an NFT, rather than make a direct donation to the organization of your choice? All it‚Äôs doing, really, is putting a mediator in charge of your money (sort of ironic, for an industry premised on doing away with mediators).  A strange caveat with UkraineDAO is that donors to the group bidding party will eventually receive $LOVE tokens, apportioned pro rata according to what they put in (donate 1% of the ETH in the pool, and you‚Äôll get 1% of the $LOVE tokens). The official website for UkraineDAO insists that these tokens ‚Äúhave NO utility nor value, but are a beautiful testament and reminder of your contribution to a noble cause,‚Äù but methinks the DAO doth protest too much. $LOVE tokens are just ERC-20s, bespoke cryptocurrencies on the Ethereum network. They can trade on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, if they‚Äôre liquid enough; speculators could eventually swoop in and pump the price of $LOVE, generating a market outside of the DAO‚Äôs control.  None of this is exactly predatory, but these kinds of theatrics might confuse some prospective donors. If you want to give money, you can just give money ‚Äì direct donations are very much still on the table.",POSITIVE,DOT | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | DOT | ETH | FIAT,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/02/28/crypto-donations-are-about-more-than-censorship-resistance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5dffa4daf9b9b4a82dbf12c1761b691922af7468-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, this approach - to attempt to create a digital metaverse that will somehow upgrade or replace our time spent online is an odd one.

The new miner will reach 135 terahash/second (TH/s), a measure of computing power, at an electricity efficiency of 26 joules/terahash (J/TH). This makes it more efficient than Bitmain's latest model, the Antminer S19 Pro+ Hyd., which delivers hashrate of 198 TH/s with an efficiency of 27.5 J/TH. The miner is also more efficient than MicroBT's Whatsminer M30S++, which brings 112 TH/s at an efficiency of 31 J/TH.  The second-gen Intel miner doesn't beat out Bitmain's Antminer S19j XP, however, which can be as efficient as 21.5 J/TH, reaching 140 TH/s of hashrate. Power efficiency is crucial for bitcoin miners, as energy is one of their biggest operational expenses.  It is unclear whether Intel will be selling exactly the same mining rigs to all of its customers. Its supply agreement with Griid includes design materials, which indicates that the miners' rigs could be tailor-made for or by the clients using Intel's mining chips. Jack Dorsey, whose company Block, formerly known as Square, is also buying Intel chips, has said they are designing an open source mining system based on ""custom"" silicon.  The new miner is half the price of an Antminer S19 Pro, while being 15% more efficient, improving gross profits by 130%, Griid's presentation said.  The presentation doesn't specifically identify the miner as Intel's, but Griid is known to be working with Intel based on a previously published supply agreement and Intel's own statements.  Intel revealed the details of the first generation of its mining chip at a semiconductor conference earlier in February. But it is the second generation that will be shipped to Griid, Argo Blockchain and Block later this year.  The chip giant's entrance into the mining rig game is expected to break a supply side dominated by a few companies.

But the question, which was made during a bail hearing in a criminal case, might not be answered.  In an oral question, Supreme Court Justice Surya Kant asked Additional Solicitor General of India Aishwarya Bhati to explain the government's stance after the finance minister announced proposals in February that include a 30% tax on crypto trading, raising confusion as to the legal status of cryptocurrencies.  In response, the government lawyer said ""we will do that,"" according to Live Law, a legal news website. He went on to explain that although the case involved cryptocurrencies, their legality was not a central issue, implying that the government did not need to respond. A court order did not mention that it would expect a response, and it's not clear the court will expect a response at the next hearing.  ""It was a casual remark,"" said Deepak Prakash, the defense lawyer. ""It was not the main issue concerning the court,"" he added.  The court was hearing a request to cancel the bail of Ajay Bhardwaj related to the GainBitcoin case in which the perpetrators are alleged to have offered a return of 10% on bitcoin for 18 months. It is alleged that the scammers collected a total 80,000 bitcoins with a value of $2.7 billion from thousands of people.  The government's legal team feels the court was satisfied with its explanation that the case was not relevant to the legality of crypto, and believes that's why it did not persist on that line of questioning, and thus the government has no need respond to the question in the next hearing, according to people familiar with the team's thinking.",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | REGULATION | TRADING,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/28/indias-top-court-queries-government-on-crypto-but-may-not-expect-a-response,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22941208e58885ab285c14e161ebd1773f8f9680-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Today's show will feature guests:  Kapil Rathi, co-founder and CEO, CrossTower  Alona Shevchenko, founder, UkraineDAO  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin posted moderate gains early Monday while traditional risk assets tanked on concerns that the West's stricter punitive sanctions on Russia will push the global economy into stagflation ‚Äì a situation in which an economy experiences a simultaneous increase in price pressures and stagnation in growth.  The top cryptocurrency moved above $38,000, partially erasing Sunday's 3% drop. Meanwhile, Asian and European stocks tanked, and Dow futures fell 800 points before regaining some poise.  The Russian ruble crashed 40% in Moscow, hitting a record low of 118 per U.S. dollar. The greenback gained ground across the board, with the money market showing signs of dollar funding stress.  The leading cryptocurrency remained resilient, perhaps having priced the escalation over the weekend. Crypto markets are open 24/7, contrary to traditional markets, which are available to trade five days a week.

Per James Pethokoukis, a columnist and an economic policy analyst, strategists at Goldman Sachs now expect four additional rates hikes in 2023 in addition to seven rate hikes this year. The investment banking giant previously anticipated three hikes next year.  However, the bitcoin market is showing no signs of panic yet, as evident from the blockchain data and derivatives market activity.  Data provided by blockchain analytics firm Glassnode show that the seven-day average of the number of coins held on centralized exchanges hovers near multi-year lows reached in the final quarter of 2021. That's a sign of solid holding sentiment.  Investors typically move their coins to exchanges when intending to liquidate their holdings.  The put-call skews show demand for put options or downside protection has slightly weakened despite the escalation of the crisis over the weekend. According to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew, the one-week put-call skew stood at 12% at press time versus 18% on Thursday.  Put-call skews measure the cost of puts or bearish bets relative to calls or bullish bets.  The crypto community doesn't seem worried about prospects of central banks resorting to faster rate hikes to avoid stagflation. Perhaps, investors are anticipating dovish talk from major central banks, given the money markets are exhibiting signs of stress in the dollar funding markets.  Early today, the gap between the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and Fed rates for one-month contracts widened the most since March 2020, according to Bloomberg. The widening of the spread represents tighter liquidity for the dollar, the global reserve currency.  Focus on the bitcoin-gold ratio  The bitcoin-gold ratio traded at under the 21-month exponential moving average support of 20.50 at press time.

The study claimed that criminal whales still hold $25 billion in crypto assets despite substantial law enforcement seizures last year. Cryptocurrency had a solid year in 2021, reaching a value of over $3 trillion in November, while bitcoin, which accounts for around a third of all cryptocurrency, also achieved a high until plummeting by more than 40% last week. Criminals who stole bitcoin were among the biggest winners from rising prices, as the number of cryptocurrencies linked to illegal operations more than quadrupled since last year. The Dark Web comes in second, providing $448 million in illegal cryptocurrency. Scams rank third with $192 million, Fraud Shops in fourth with $66 million, and Ransomware is at last row with $30 million.

American entities and citizens are prohibited from engaging in transactions with the Central Bank of Russia, the National Wealth Fund of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, the Treasury's OFAC announced Monday.  Furthermore, the OFAC has sanctioned the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which has exposure to the U.S. financial system, and its CEO Kirill Dmitriev, ""a known Putin ally.""  ""Russian President Vladimir Putin and his inner circle of cronies have long relied on RDIF and Dmitriev to raise funds abroad, including in the United States,"" according to the statement.  The announcement is the latest of a wave of economic sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine last week. The moves helped send the ruble tumbling 40% earlier today, forcing the Russian central bank to try and defend the currency by hiking its benchmark interest rate to 20% from 9.5%.  There have also been calls for crypto exchanges to block addresses of Russian users, but the exchanges ‚Äì notably Binance and Kraken ‚Äì have pointedly declined to do so.

42420991,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXAqdR,1646047915,Ukraine Government Is Using Crypto Aid to Purchase Critical Supplies,"The Ukrainian government is purchasing critical supplies, including gas, food and military equipment, using cryptocurrencies donated as the country stands against a Russian invasion. Around $10 million has already been spent.  The donations are being distributed from the government‚Äôs digital wallets, set up by Kyiv-based crypto exchange Kuna, to other digital wallets before being spent, blockchain data show. By Monday morning, around $6.5 million worth of ether had been moved out of a government wallet to the exchange.  ""We are evacuating people so we are sending money to buy petrol, to buy food and water for the people who are evacuating. We are sending some money to the local military personnel who can buy some supplies locally,‚Äù Kuna founder Michael Chobanian told CoinDesk. The government is also buying drones, heat vision goggles and petrol, he said.  CoinDesk has been tracking the inflow of more than $16 million of cryptocurrencies into three digital wallets associated with Ukraine‚Äôs defense against the Russian invasion. One wallet, set up by a local nonprofit, had raised over $7 million in bitcoin at publication time. The two others (one bitcoin and another ether) set up by Kuna on behalf of the Ukrainian government on Friday, had raised more than $8 million by Sunday.  Chobanian shared a report on his Twitter account on Monday showing the total crypto support for the government of Ukraine through a variety of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins has surpassed $12 million. Elliptic, which helps track transactions on blockchains, said Monday that government and nongovernmental organizations had reached $20 million.  The funds were collected as Russia closed in on Ukraine‚Äôs capital, Kyiv. On Saturday, Western nations agreed to impose tougher financial sanctions on Russia in an effort to deter the conflict. On Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed to start peace talks just as Russian President Vladimir Putin put the country's nuclear deterrence force on high alert.  Bitcoin donations raised by the government are being distributed quite quickly, blockchain data shows. Almost all of the bitcoin collected, amounting to about $4 million, have already been sent to various wallets.  ‚ÄúWe're managing to buy all of this stuff in Europe using crypto. A lot of my friends in the crypto industry are helping out. We're sending them crypto, they're paying for [things] in euros,‚Äù Chobanian said.  Chobanian said on Sunday that a majority of the outgoing bitcoin is for small transactions and that the government is saving funds for some larger purchases. At first, bitcoin was sent out of the government wallet in small amounts (typically under $100). On Sunday, around $26,000 worth of bitcoin left the wallet in one transaction. By publication time on Monday, only around $66,000 of ether remained in the government‚Äôs wallet, according to transaction data on Etherscan.  Chobanian says vendors are stepping up to accept crypto in exchange for supplies and crypto is proving to be more efficient than traditional payment methods.  ‚ÄúIt's really difficult to [send money] using traditional methods. First of all, it takes a lot of time. Secondly, it's a lot of bureaucracy and so on. Here, we are really fast. So we receive money and we spend it almost immediately,‚Äù Chobanian said.  On Sunday, Chobanian said the government is also planning to spend the funds on some larger purchases, though he didn't specify what those would be. Judging from the substantial draining of funds from the Ethereum wallet on Monday, larger purchases are being made.  ‚ÄúWe are just like a crypto bank for the government at the moment,‚Äù he said.  Not everyone‚Äôs having an easy time with spending. Almost $7 million in bitcoin is sitting in a wallet associated with a Ukrainian nonprofit named ‚ÄúCome Back Alive.‚Äù Almost all the funds were raised in a matter of days, specifically to aid Ukraine‚Äôs military. Only $1.6 million worth of bitcoin have left the wallet. In other words, even at a moment of crisis, millions of dollars remain unmoved. The charity didn't respond to requests for comment by publication time.  Meanwhile, Ukraine‚Äôs central bank has suspended the country‚Äôs currency market and limited cash withdrawals. Chobanian says there are efforts to remove these restrictions to improve the efficient redistribution of money.  All crypto exchanges operating in Ukraine are doing pretty much the same thing, Chobanian said.  ‚ÄúWe're united, We understand that if we don't do it right now, that's it. We don't have any future for our country,‚Äù he said.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/28/ukraine-government-is-using-crypto-aid-to-purchase-critical-supplies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/73b30dd12c3dfa4264974673609fa6c6b71cec00-1024x682.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the suspension of operations at the Minsk embassy and authorized staff to depart from Moscow, the Associated Press reported, citing a statement from the U.S. State Department.  The embassy closure comes as the world looked toward the peace talks in Belarus and the financial markets sought signs of a possible end to the conflict.

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine last week, Russia has been hit with economic sanctions that have now seen the ruble tumble as much as 29%, leading to the Russian central bank raising its main interest rate to 20% on Monday.  As with mainstream financial markets, cryptocurrency has felt the ripples of the hostilities in Eastern Europe, with bitcoin falling to a low of $34,636 last Thursday, a drop of more than 11% from the previous day.

However, more than half of active vehicles in the region are inefficient 2-stroke petrol-powered motorcycles, mostly used in taxi and delivery services that drive hundreds of kilometers per day. The fuel that they burn is costly for drivers, and produces toxic CO2 and fine particulate emissions in large volumes. Recognizing the need for cheaper and more efficient transportation solutions, Bob Eco Ltd., a rapidly-growing electric vehicle and clean energy company, entered the African markets with a line of orange-clad electric two and three-wheelers designed for the needs of taxi and delivery drivers. Since the first one hit the road in October of 2020, Bob Eco&apos;s bikes have created a total of 2.6 jobs per bike, and saved 5 tons of CO2 emissions from being released into the atmosphere every year. Able to save on fuel costs, drivers that make the switch to one of Bob Eco&apos;s vehicles nearly quadruple their take-home pay on average - enabling them to support their families and equip their homes with basic necessities like running water. Further, Bob Eco provides its bikes on a lease-to-own basis, giving drivers the chance to accumulate wealth once they pay off their rides.

Even the most significant self-custody platforms, such as OpenSea, are vulnerable to malicious behavior and attacks. Read on to find out why security should be your number one priority, and learn from a recent, serious phishing attempt on OpenSea. What does self-custody mean? Essentially, self-custody in crypto refers to holders&apos; sole responsibility to handle and store their information data such as private keys. Consequently, a self-custody platform does not keep any kind of record of private keys, and thus delegates the task of safeguarding them to key owners. About the OpenSea phishing attack Phishing is a type of malicious activity that manipulates the victim into sharing confidential credentials or information, mostly by fake communication. Phishing is a serious threat even today, and it&apos;s also one of the hardest attacks to discover, as it&apos;s disguised as ordinary messaging. To demonstrate how real this issue is, here&apos;s the recent case of OpenSea, one of the most important Non-Fungible Token (NFT) marketplaces of its time. According to official sources, the phishing attack influenced 32 platform users, who actually suffered damages to their holdings because of the event.

Some DeFi platforms (like AAVE) support a newer type of loan, the flash loan. When a loanee takes out a flash loan, no collateral is required. This is achievable because flash loans are repaid within the same transaction that they are taken out - a smart contract is used to rapidly perform a series of transactions that result with the loanee ultimately repaying the loan. Flash loans are atomic, meaning that they are only processed if all included transactions are executed. If they are not, they are rolled back. This enables individuals to borrow massive sums with almost no risk. It is common for borrowers to withdraw tens of thousands, millions, or even tens of millions of dollars at once, albeit for a brief period. What Are Flash Loans Used For? Flash loans have three primary uses: trading arbitrage, collateral swapping, and self-liquidation. Here&apos;s an explanation of each: Trading Arbitrage: Different exchanges may charge different prices for certain assets, opening opportunities to purchase and sell the same assets on different exchanges for a profit. This process is called &apos;trading arbitrage&apos;.

Non-Fungible Tokens(NFTs) and cryptocurrencies allow for Play-to-Earn mechanics that let players earn revenue through in-game activity, turning the traditional Pay-to-Play model on its head. The King is dead, long live the King! Play-to-Earn games are one type of blockchain game in which players earn unique NFTs through in-game advancement. In blockchain gaming, players have complete control over their digital assets. In traditional games, the player may lose access to their collectible items if the server is shut down.

Popular games such as Axie Infinity, owned by the Vietnam based company Sky Mavis, boast 2.5 million daily active users.

Fedorov tweeted his request, explaining that ""it's crucial to freeze not only the addresses linked to Russian and Belarusian politicians, but also to sabotage ordinary users.""  Binance, one of the world's leading cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volume, said it has no plan to freeze user accounts in Russia.  ""We are not going to unilaterally freeze millions of innocent users' accounts. Crypto is meant to provide greater financial freedom for people across the globe. To unilaterally decide to ban people's access to their crypto would fly in the face of the reason why crypto exists. However, we are taking the steps necessary to ensure we take action against those that have had sanctions levied against them while minimizing impact to innocent users. Should the international community widen those sanctions further, we will apply those aggressively as well,‚Äù a Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk.  The crypto exchange's stance was first reported by Reuters.  DMarket, a Ukrainian-born digital assets company that works as an exchange to trade virtual items from any game on any platform connecting the entertainment industry with the global metaverse, has accepted the request.  The company tweeted to say ""Ukrainian-born startup DMarket cuts all relationships with Russia and Belarus due to the invasion of Ukraine.

Vlad Panchenko, CEO and founder of DMarket had previously convinced his board to fly more than 100 of his employees and their families from Kyiv to Montenegro three weeks ago when Russia was threatening an invasion, according to Axios.  In response to the move by DMarket, Fedorov tweeted that ""funds from these [frozen] accounts could be donated to the war effort. Nowadays Robin Hoods. Bravo.""  However, Jesse Powell, founder of crypto excahnge Kraken, retweeted Fedorov's tweet to announce and explain why his company won't freeze accounts.

Ministers will soon publish a white paper proposing reforms to the Companies House, the U.K.'s registrar where all businesses must submit financial statements and other information.  The reforms will insist that applicants registering new companies should provide more details of their identities.  These proposals are being brought forward in conjunction with another economic crime bill introducing a register of overseas entities, requiring foreign owners of companies to reveal their identities to prevent criminals from concealing funds behind shell companies.

However, the resilience to the escalating Ukraine-Russia crisis may prove fleeting as demand for the U.S. dollar, the global reserve currency and one of the most liquid asset globally, is rising.  At 08:23 UTC, the cryptocurrency was changing hands near $38,350, representing a 1.7% gain on the day. Prices fell over 3% on Sunday, providing negative cues to traditional markets.  Oil is trading 4% higher on both sides of the Atlantic, extending its recent exponential rally. Russia and Ukraine-linked agricultural commodities like wheat and corn are up 4% and 3%, respectively, according to data from investing.com.  ""The range of near-term price outcomes for commodities has become extreme, given the concern of further military escalation, energy sanctions or potential for a cease-fire,"" Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients on Sunday, according to Reuters.  The Russian ruble plunged 40% during early Russian trading hours and hit a record low of 118 per U.S. dollar as the Western countries stepped up punitive sanctions on Moscow, intending to isolate the country from the global financial system.  The Bank of Russia raised rates from 9.5% to 20% and ordered companies to sell 80% of their foreign currency revenue to counter ruble depreciation risks and higher inflation, according to Reuters.  Prospects of higher price pressures and fiat currency crash have strengthened the case for holding assets with a store-of-value appeal, such as bitcoin.  The sustainability of bitcoin's gains is under question, as the escalating Russia-Ukraine crisis has led to stress in the dollar funding markets.  The gap between the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and Fed rates contracts or the so-called FRA/OIS spread, has widened the most since March 2020, according to Bloomberg.  The spread measures how expensive or cheap it is for banks to borrow liquidity (dollars) from other banks. A widening spread indicates credit crunch, the likes of which were last seen during the coronavirus-induced crash of March 2020. In such situations, investors usually prefer to hold cash, mainly the U.S. dollar.  The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against majors, is trading at 97.15 at press time, up 0.66% on the day.",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/28/bitcoin-resilient-as-commodity-prices-inflate-dollar-strength-may-hurt,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/980548c19131f73659616dcf9944fb5607bec1fc-1642x826.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Past Performance of FTM The lower price rejection from $1.20 promoted the underlying bullish trend momentum growth, resulting in an engulfing candlestick as a follow-through. The short but sharp recovery of 17% in FTM prices surpassed the 200-day EMA but failed to close above it. Leading to a higher price rejection, the rejection drove the prices down by 10% within a day.

Hence, the increased bearish momentum indicates a downfall to the $1.2 mark if the prices give closing below the $1.5 mark. Downfall in the Fantom coin price brings the crucial EMAs- 50 and 100 giving a bearish crossover.

In fact, transactions on the Ethereum network are now 80% less expensive than it was around 48 days ago on January 10. Ethereum Gas Fees Continue to Drop As of Feb. 28, the average transaction fees on the Ethereum (ETH) network have been down to 0.0044 ETH or $11.44 per transfer. The last time Ethereum network fees were this low was six months ago, back in August 2021. With the average fees at $11.44 per transfer, it&apos;s 80.26% cheaper than it was transferring ETH on January 10, 2022. At that time, the average transaction fee was $52 per transaction. Meanwhile, the median-sized gas fee was $29 in ether 48 days ago on January 10. Today it&apos;s down 84.31% lower at 0.0019 ETH or $4.95 per transfer. L2 transactions are also cheaper than on-chain transactions on the Ethereum network. Currently, the lowest L2 fee to send ETH is by leveraging Loopring for $0.08 per transfer. To swap tokens with Loopring, the gas price cost $0.65 per swap at the time of writing. What Could Be the Reason? According to a report, a possible reason for the drop in gas price could be an increase in layer 2 activity or users moving to other networks.

42375228,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw6c1R,1646029706,Ruble-Denominated Bitcoin Volume Surges to 9-Month High,"Trading volumes between the Russian ruble and bitcoin increased to a nine-month high as the country's fiat currency plunged to record lows due to the fallout from the invasion of Ukraine.  Data tracked by Kaiko, a Paris-based cryptocurrency research provider, shows that ruble (RUB)-denominated bitcoin volume surged to nearly 1.5 billion RUB on Thursday, hitting its highest level since May.  ""The activity was concentrated on Binance,"" Kaiko research analyst Clara Medalie told CoinDesk in an email. ""Bitcoin-Ukrainian hryvnia volume has also spiked, but not as high as October levels. BTC-UAH only trades on 2 exchanges ‚Äì Binance and LocalBitcoin.""  Similar trends were observed in tether-ruble and tether-hryvnia trading volumes, Medalie added. Tether (USDT), the world's largest stablecoin by market value, offers price stability in the often volatile world of cryptocurrencies by maintaining a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar.  Kaiko data shows USDT/RUB trading volume also rose to an eight-month high of 1.3 billion RUB on Thursday.  The spike in the ruble-based crypto trading volumes came as investors scrambled to move out of the ruble, fearing stricter sanctions from the West.  The Russian currency plunged over 8% to 90 per U.S. dollar last week and extended the slide by another 28% early today, reaching a record low of 118 per dollar, according to Bloomberg data. Gold, U.S. Treasurys, the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc have been the beneficiaries of the flight to safety.  Over the weekend, the U.S. and its allies stepped up punitive measures against Russia, intending to stop its banks from accessing SWIFT, the messaging network underpinning global financial transactions.

Buyers have kept the critical range of $0.6. However, we cannot assure that buyers won due to the great interest in IOTA. Trading volumes during the last 3 trading weeks were extremely small. The weekly candle from 21 February has every chance to close the pin bar. This means that the probability of the IOTA price rebounding to the first target is $1.

Sellers managed to suppress the aggression of buyers and continue the local fall wave from December 2021. https://www.tradingview.com/x/vAyGqDPK/ However, the final target of potential price growth in the near future is $1.2. This mark is a global trend line that sellers have been confidently keeping since April 2021. If buyers fail to control the $1.2 mark, we will expect a prolonged consolidation in the IOTA market. Loss of control of $0.6 by buyers will lead to a complete collapse of the IOTA market.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening:  Weekend Prices: Bitcoin and other cryptos fell significantly as the war in Ukraine escalated.  Technician's take: Investors are likely to remain active trading between $30,000 and $46,000.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $37,721 -3.2%  Ether (ETH): $2,628 -5.1%  After largely holding their own through the early part of the weekend, bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies plummeted on Sunday as the war in Ukraine intensified.  Satellite images showed columns of Russian troops heading toward the Ukraine capital, Kyiv. On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin placed his nuclear forces on alert in response to sanctions and other measures that the U.S. and its Western European allies have taken to punish Russia and support Ukraine. Later in the day, Ukraine announced it had agreed to hold peace talks with Russia to end the invasion.  At the time of publication, bitcoin was trading under $37,800, down over 3%. Ether was changing hands at about $2,600, down over 5%. The second largest crypto by market cap started the weekend at over $2,700. Almost all major altcoins had dropped significantly. Terra's luna and avalanche were off about 7% and 8.5%, respectively.  Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of fund manager BitBull Capital, said that bitcoin had returned to the same $37,000 support line it faced last Monday. But he added that only ""a broader sell-off on risk-on assets,"" stemming from larger economic pressures could keep bitcoin under $37,000 or force it much lower in the days ahead.  DiPasquale said that bitcoin's pricing late Sunday was important for ""setting the tone ahead."" ""Because crypto trades 24/7, it is sometimes seen as an early indicator where equities markets may go on Monday's opening.""  If bitcoin dips, he said that the next support line would appear at $35,000. But he also struck an optimistic note, saying that his firm has been ""hearing that $35K has been a major buy-in point for larger buyers, including corporate treasuries this year.""

Late Thursday U.S. time, BitMEX founders Arthur Hayes and Benjamin Delo pleaded guilty to violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).  ‚ÄúAs a result of its willful failure to implement [anti-money laundering] and [know-your-customer] programs, BitMEX was in effect a money laundering platform. For example, in May 2018, Hayes was notified of allegations that BitMEX was being used to launder the proceeds of a cryptocurrency hack,‚Äù the U.S. Department of Justice said in a press release Thursday.  The plea followed a $100 million settlement in August to resolve charges against the company (entirely separate from those against its executives) as the exchange‚Äôs new leadership ‚Äì the original founders Arthur Hayes, Ben Delo, Samuel Reed and Gregory Dwyer had left the company ‚Äì wanted to signal that this was a new chapter.  Remember: BitMEX is incorporated in the Seychelles, with its main offices in Hong Kong and Singapore. Hayes and Delo resided offshore.  But these settlements mean the prosecution‚Äôs case against BitMEX, and the separate one against Hayes and Delo, will never be tested in court. (Reed and Dwyer haven‚Äôt signaled their intent to settle.) Certainly, those accused of a crime have the right to enter a plea deal to settle their case; court proceedings are drawn out, stressful affairs. However, this agreement still means that the ambiguity around the case will endure and we‚Äôll never know the strength of the DOJ‚Äôs argument.  Remember, BitMEX has never accepted fiat currency, unlike other exchanges. It only traded in bitcoin (BTC) until recently. Only in November it added tether (USDT) to the list of accepted crypto.  So if an institution doesn‚Äôt actually accept fiat currency or provide an off-ramp for it, can it be charged under the Bank Secrecy Act?  The case introduced a new area of jurisprudence for the BSA, Ross Feingold, a Taipei-based lawyer and political risk consultant, said during the case‚Äôs early days.  Feingold, who had formerly served as in-house counsel for Royal Bank of Scotland, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan in Hong Kong, highlighted that this would have been a precedent-setting case for the BSA as it would have been one of the first uses of the Secrecy Act against a non-bank financial institution.  Prior to BitMEX, the Secrecy Act was used in 2018 against a firm called Central States Capital Markets, which had similar gaps in its KYC/AML regime like BitMEX. But that case ended with a deferred prosecution agreement where CSCM agreed to change its procedures in exchange for no charges.  Braden Perry, a former Commodity Futures Trading Commission enforcement attorney and now a partner at Kennyhertz Perry, said at the time that this was ""dangerous territory for the CFTC.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe CFTC‚Äôs increasingly expanded view of their jurisdiction will likely be challenged, especially against offshore exchanges and participants that have limited ties to the United States,‚Äù he said at the time.  But all of this was never tested in court. Could the Bank Secrecy Act apply when the institution in question isn‚Äôt a bank and didn‚Äôt even deal with currency? Can the CFTC regulate a market that is based offshore and doesn‚Äôt specifically target U.S. residents? (While there were concerns over BitMEX‚Äôs leaky IP blocking regime, it also didn‚Äôt advertise.)  We won‚Äôt know how the court would rule as the case against BitMEX and the separate ones with Hayes and Delo have been settled. The prosecution‚Äôs evidence won‚Äôt be tested in the adversarial nature of a court proceeding. Some of these questions might be answered in the upcoming case involving the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Terraform Labs.  Terraform Labs is claiming the agency did not have jurisdiction over CEO Do Kwon when he was served with a subpoena during a conference in New York because neither the company nor Kwon are U.S. residents. Terraform Labs‚Äô lawyers are arguing that just because U.S. residents accessed the company‚Äôs services doesn‚Äôt mean there was ‚Äúpurposeful availment.‚Äù The lawyers cited prior case law (Royalty Network Inc. v. Dishant.com) that to claim that because a website is available in a market doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúpurposeful attempt to take advantage of the ‚Ä¶ market.‚Äù  That Hayes, et al. didn‚Äôt have their day in court is a shame. Under intense scrutiny, the government‚Äôs case against them might not have been as strong as it seemed.  Yes, Hayes taunted U.S. authorities: The initial indictment quoted comments he made at the Tangle in Taipei saying that Seychellian authorities could be ‚Äúbribed with coconuts‚Äù and equated dealing with New York regulators to forced sodomy.  Eventually, this part of the submission was blocked by a judge and rightfully so as anyone in the audience could see it was a joke directed towards New York University professor Nouriel Roubini, his cantankerous debate opponent onstage.  But the fact this comment was highlighted by prosecutors shows that it might be Hayes‚Äô ego that bothered them. Having an ego is certainly no crime.  Technician's take  Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a sharp reversal on Thursday, and extended gains into Friday. For now, selling pressure has faded, which means buyers could remain active between the $30,000 and $46,000 range.  BTC returned above $38,000 and is up 6% over the past 24 hours. On Friday, the cryptocurrency was down 2% over the previous week, which meant the recent bounce had not shifted the short-term downtrend. On Sunday, bitcoin had dropped below $37,500 as the war in Ukraine intensified.  Thursday‚Äôs price action triggered initial downside exhaustion signals, per the DeMARK indicators, similar to what occurred on Jan. 24, which preceded a 30% upswing in price. Still, in bear markets, counter-trend signals can be brief or invalid depending on the status of long-term momentum readings. Currently, momentum remains negative on the weekly and monthly charts.  Immediate resistance is seen at $40,000, which could stall the current price bounce. There is stronger resistance at $46,700, which capped upside moves earlier this month.
