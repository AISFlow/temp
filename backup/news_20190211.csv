42430172,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMooXh,1549926616,Cory Johnson Out As Ripple's Chief Market Strategist,"Cory Johnson is out at distributed ledger startup Ripple as its chief market strategist, CoinDesk has learned.  Tom Channick, a Ripple spokesperson, confirmed the move to CoinDesk after it emerged on social media that references to Ripple and Johnson's role at the company appeared to have been scrubbed from his Twitter account.  Channick sent the following statement to CoinDesk:  ""Cory’s last year at Ripple was a success in representing the company to investors, press and regulators. Cory helped Ripple with strategy internally and overall industry education. But due to changes in market conditions, we’ve chosen to eliminate the role of Chief Market Strategist.”  Joining Ripple in early 2018 after eight years at Bloomberg TV, Johnson explained at the time to CNBC that his role would be ""to try and explain, listen and set strategies to make it easy for Wall Street and the world of finance to understand what we're doing."" Indeed, Johnson served as a key spokesperson for the company, making appearances on mainstream media platforms and evangelizing Ripple's offerings.  At the World Blockchain Forum on November, Johnson participated in a fireside chat with CoinDesk. When asked about Brad Garlinghouse's prediction earlier in 2018 that ""dozens"" of banks would be on Ripple before 2019 began, Johnson put some of the blame on major banks' failure to provide a custody solution.  That said, he argued that the sense for crypto in the business community was changing.  ""I sat with a bunch of people, a major customer, yesterday and there were 10 people in the room they had a lot of questions,"" he said at the time. ""But I'll also tell you when there's 10 people in the room there no deal getting signed. So there's still some exploration happening and I don't know where our customer count is going to be.""  Johnson could not be immediately reached for comment.

42430176,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMoohh,1549915236,Ripple Offered Multimillion-Dollar XRP Bonuses to Lure Top Tech Talent,"UPDATE (12th February 2019 16:15 UTC): Ripple originally declined to comment on bonus packages, including whether they are still being offered in 2019. Following the publication of this article, a Ripple spokesperson offered the following statement:  “Ripple does not offer engineering compensation packages that include XRP bonuses. In late 2018, we found out that a contracted recruiter was incorrectly suggesting to prospective employees that such packages were available. That individual has not worked on our behalf in months.""  __________________________________________________________________________________  Silicon Valley fintech startup Ripple goes out of its way to say it didn't create the cryptocurrency XRP. But that doesn't mean the company doesn't rely on its vast reserves of the token when courting prospective hires.  One engineer who asked to remain anonymous showed CoinDesk a recruiting email from late 2018 that promised an XRP package from Ripple of worth up to $3 million, in addition to a generous salary offer.  According to the company’s LinkedIn, Ripple is looking to hire more than a dozen engineers and technical experts, including a new head of engineering for its xCurrent project, which aims to rival the legacy messaging network SWIFT at the center of the current global payments infrastructure.  Salaries may vary according to seniority, but based on conversations with two prospective recruits, XRP bonuses for engineers generally range in value from $1 million to $6 million, according to the company’s own evaluation. As of press time, XRP is trading at roughly $0.30 per token.  (Ripple declined to comment on bonus packages, including whether they are still being offered in 2019.)  One former Ripple employee, who asked to stay anonymous for fear of legal retribution, told CoinDesk he never heard of such XRP bonus packages before 2017. However, he also noted generous equity deals are standard in Silicon Valley.  In September 2018, one prospective engineering recruit, who asked to remain anonymous because he works at a company that might someday collaborate with Ripple, told CoinDesk that he also received an email from a recruiter working on Ripple's behalf that stood out because it offered lucrative XRP packages, supposedly worth $3 million to $6 million. Both engineers currently work at top-tier tech companies in Silicon Valley, albeit the second programmer at a crypto company (thus the higher offer).  Additionally, the email claimed the global market cap of “its [Ripple’s] coin” was worth $48 billion. According to CoinMarketCap, on the day the email was sent XRP’s global market cap was closer to $13.3 billion. The prospective engineer recruit told CoinDesk he found this discrepancy alarming.  Speaking to the unusual bonus offering that caught his eye, the anonymous engineer said Ripple is “a very unpopular entity in the crypto sphere among technologists,” so he believes the company is “forced to go above and beyond to attract engineers” during the bear market.  Bear recruiting  A Ripple representative told CoinDesk the company currently employs roughly 90 engineers and technology experts, with plans to hire “aggressively” in order to expand its software as a service offering plus support RippleNet mobile wallets and payout processes.  This is part of an ongoing hiring spree. The company representative said that Ripple added 100 new employees across the company in 2018, adding:  “We move fast to acquire the best talent out there – especially considering the highly competitive nature of other startups who want to hire similar candidates.”  Former Ripple community liaison Jon Holmquist told CoinDesk that developer salaries and compensation are ballooning across Silicon Valley. As such, Holmquist said any hiring challenges might be related to the broader market downturn, not Ripple in particular.  “No one wants to join crypto for the first time during a bear market. I think that’s more of an industry-wide problem,” Holmquist said. “There’s always a shortage of talent.”  The anonymous engineer disagreed, considering the other types of recruiting emails he routinely receives.  “This is for a devops role, which is generally harder to find, but these are really big numbers,” the anonymous engineer said, referring to both the salary and XRP bonus package. “It comes across a little bit desperate.”  Serial entrepreneur Dave Schukin tweeted last June that the company offered him more than $175,000 as a base salary, which appears consistent with the other offer shared with CoinDesk.  In terms of what Ripple is looking for, the company representative said they are recruiting software experts with Java or C++ language expertise and an ample dose of teachability.  “We are not necessarily looking for blockchain experts – we can always teach domain-specific expertise,” she said. “We also think it's important that our engineers carry themselves with humility and are able to think creatively about how to solve hard problems.”  Ripple image via Shutterstock  Update (Feb. 11, 21:00 UTC): This article has been updated to clarify that the recruiting emails came from an external recruiter working on Ripple's behalf.",NEUTRAL,XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | XRP,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/02/11/ripple-offered-multimillion-dollar-xrp-bonuses-to-lure-top-tech-talent,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/94e80edab451900f88e7f0d4bca78fcd8858b001-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At press time, BNB is trading at 0.002619 BTC ($9.60) but previously reached 0.002688 at 10:00 UTC Monday – the cryptocurrency's highest price in its entire one and half year history, according to data from Binance.  Binance first listed BNB for trading on July 14, 2017, and the token has achieved a nearly 9,600 percent return on investment from its December 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) price of $0.10.  At the same time, BNB still has a ways to go before approaching it's all-time high in USD value. Current figures represent a decline of 58 percent from BNB’s USD high of $22.48 achieved on Jan. 12, 2018, data from OnchainFX further reveals.  BNB’s BTC-tied high came after a period of strong performance that played out over the past several weeks.  As can be seen in the table below, BNB has significantly outperformed the market leader and world’s largest cryptocurrency bitcoin over the past 90-days, including a 35 percent increase in the past seven days alone when bitcoin rose just 5 percent.  BNB’s recent growth has catapulted it to become the world’s 10th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which now registers $1.33 billion, according to data from Coinmarketcap.com.  While BNB may be the only well-known cryptocurrency to hit a new record of sorts, it has not been the best performer.  Data from OnchainFX reveals three cryptocurrencies have outshined BNB in the past seven days including ARK, Dentacoin, and Theta Token who have printed gains of 35 percent, 43 percent and 43 percent, respectively, against the US dollar.

42430174,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMoojh,1549905001,New Proposed ETF Would Mix Bitcoin Futures With Sovereign Debt,"UPDATE (Feb. 14, 2019): Reality Shares withdrew its proposal the next day.      A new proposed exchange-traded fund (ETF) would invest in bitcoin futures – though only as part of a larger set of more conservative investments.  Reality Shares ETF Trust, a branch of Blockforce Capital, which already launched one ETF with blockchain products, filed a Form N1-A with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Monday in partnership with NYSE Arca, looking to launch the Reality Shares Blockforce Global Currency Strategy ETF.  If approved, the fund would invest in a portfolio which includes ""high-quality, short-term sovereign debt instruments listed for trading on U.S. exchanges and denominated in U.S. dollar, euro, British pounds sterling, Japanese yen and Swiss francs,"" as well as bitcoin futures, money market mutual funds and/or other cash equivalents, according to the filing.  The fund would invest in cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts, rather than physically settled. In other words, when the contract expires, the investor would receive the cash equivalent of its value, rather than actual bitcoins. According to the filing, ""the fund will not invest directly in bitcoin.""  The proposal explains:  ""The Adviser initially constructs the Fund’s portfolio by investing approximately (i) an equal-weight of 15 [percent] of the Fund’s net assets in Fixed Income Securities denominated in each Fiat Significant Global Currency; (ii) 15 [percent] of the Fund’s net assets representing notional exposure in Bitcoin Futures and (iii) 10 [percent] of the Fund’s net assets in Money Market Instruments for margin and/or cash management purposes, each as measured at the time of purchase (the 'Target Portfolio').""  Reality Shares' filing goes on to add that ""the Adviser seeks to reallocate the Fund’s assets approximately to the Target Portfolio on the business day following the date that one or more of the Significant Global Currencies moves by more than 20 [percent] up or down from its original 15 [percent] portfolio equal-weight, calculated as a percentage of the Fund’s net assets.""  Initially, Reality Shares plans to invest in the bitcoin futures offered by the major Chicago futures exchanges, Cboe and CME, though it might look for other bitcoin futures products in the future.  Bitcoin ETFs  Reality Shares' proposal comes on the heels of two bitcoin-specific ETF filings made by Bitwise Asset Management and VanEck/SolidX last month. While Bitwise's proposal was also filed by NYSE Arca, VanEck and SolidX are working with Cboe BZX Exchange.  The VanEck/SolidX proposal is famously identical to an earlier proposal that many hoped would be the first bitcoin ETF approved. However, the companies pulled the previous version after the prolonged U.S. government shutdown, saying at the time that they were unable to continue discussions about the proposal with the SEC.  Both of these bitcoin ETFs differ from Monday's filing in that they do not include sovereign debt instruments.  Editor's note: This article has been updated.

Finablr, which owns the two brands, announced Sunday that “real-time” cross-border remittances using RippleNet are now live, starting with payments for its international customers to Thailand. Other destination countries are expected to be added going forward.  The service was launched in partnership with Thailand’s Siam Commercial Bank, the firm said.  Finablr director and CEO Promoth Manghat commented:  “The adoption of blockchain opens up considerable potential to streamline remittances and provide a frictionless, fast and secure payments experience.”  Aside from UAE Exchange and Unimoni, Finablr also owns brands such as Travelex, Xpress Money, Remit2India Ditto and Swych, and is looking to deploy blockchain technology across some of their services too, according to the announcement.  UAE Exchange first partnered with Ripple in February 2018, aiming to reduce the costs and frictions associated with cross-border transactions. In December, Manghat revealed that the firm was planning to launch Ripple-based payments to Asia by the first quarter of this year.  At least 200 banks and financial firms around the world have now tapped Ripple for blockchain-based payments.  Back in December, National Bank of Kuwait (NBK) launched a new remittance service, dubbed NBK Direct Remit, using Ripple's technology. Malaysian banking group CIMB, South Korean crypto exchange Coinone and U.S. banking giant PNC have also joined RippleNet in recent months.

Security firm ESET published a blog post on Friday, saying that the malware, known as a “clipper,” intercepts the content of the clipboard and, if it finds the addresses of online cryptocurrency wallets, can replace them with addresses owned by the attacker.  The malware-laden app, discovered by ESET, impersonates a service called MetaMask that provides access to ethereum decentralized applications, or dapps. The malware's main purpose is to steal MetaMask users' credentials and private keys to be able to access their ethereum funds. However, it can also intercept bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) wallet address copied to the clipboard.  MetaMask does not currently offer an app product for mobile devices.  The fake app's description can be seen below:  The app was removed from the Play Store after ESET reported it to Google's security team.  In response to the malware's discovery, MetaMask tweeted:  ""We would appreciate if @GooglePlayDev would reserve trademarked names for apps, especially repeat phishing targets like us.”  This isn't MetaMask's first issue with Google. Back in July, the firm's browser extension was erroneously removed from Google's Chrome Web Store for about five hours before being restored.  To stay safe from such mobile malware, ESET advised users to keep devices updated and double-check every step in all crypto transactions, including wallet addresses copied on a clipboard.  Earlier this month, another form of malware was discovered by cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks that steals browser cookies and other information on victims’ Apple Mac computers to steal cryptocurrencies.

42430168,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMooVh,1549890059,IBM Blockchain Assists Groundwater Pilot in Drought-Prone California,"IBM and two other organizations will marry blockchain and IoT to help manage groundwater usage in an ""at-risk"" Californian aquifer.  Aimed to improve sustainable use of the key water resource, IBM announced Friday that California's Sacramento San Joaquin River Delta will be tracked in “real-time” through a joint effort between the Freshwater Trust, a U.S-based nonprofit working to preserve and restore freshwater ecosystems, and SweetSense, a provider of internet of things (IoT) sensors for the development sector.  The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta covers 1,100 square miles and provides water to the San Francisco Bay Area and coastal and southern California.  The project is being jointly funded by the Water Foundation and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and will also receive research support from the University of Colorado Boulder, IBM said.  For the effort, IoT sensors will transmit water extraction data to satellites, after which it will be recorded on the IBM Blockchain Platform hosted in the IBM Cloud. It also uses smart contracts to automatically execute transactions when certain conditions are met.  “Through a web-based dashboard, water consumers, including farmers; financers and regulators will all be able to monitor and track the use of groundwater to demonstrate how sustainable pumping levels can be achieved through the trading of groundwater use shares in the State of California,” IBM explained.  For example, if a farmer was not planning on watering their land for a season, they could trade or sell water credits on the blockchain to another farmer.  SweetSense is already monitoring the groundwater supplies for “over a million” people in Kenya and Ethiopia through IoT sensors and will be mirroring the same system in California, its CEO Evan Thomas said.  According to Dr. Solomon Assefa, vice president for emerging market solutions and director at IBM Research – Africa:  “With the addition of the blockchain we can bridge critical trust and transparency gaps making it possible to build a robust, scalable and cost-efficient platform for managing precious groundwater supplies anywhere in the world.""  IBM added that the pilot project comes as the result of California’s Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), which was signed into law in 2014. The act mandated creating agencies and groups to ensure a plan is in place to make local groundwater usage sustainable.

42430210,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMooxh,1549882819,Bitcoin Eyes $3.8K After High-Volume Price Breakout,"View  Bitcoin gained 7.8 percent on Friday, confirming a falling wedge breakout on the daily chart. The bearish-to-bullish trend change was backed by a jump in trading volumes to levels last seen in mid-November.  Prices could soon cross the 50-day moving average resistance at $3,642 and test resistance levels lined up at $3,800 and $4,000 in the next few days.  A break below the Jan. 29 low of $3,322 would invalidate the bullish setup. That looks unlikely, though, as the high-volume wedge breakout has confirmed bearish exhaustion signaled by falling volumes on the weekly chart.  Bitcoin (BTC) saw a high-volume bullish move Friday that may have opened the doors for a rally above $3,800.  The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization jumped to $3,711 on Feb. 8 – the highest level since Jan. 19 – and ended the day with a 7.8 percent gain, according to Bitstamp data. That's the biggest single-day rise since Dec. 28  The rally to three-week highs confirmed an upside break of the falling wedge – a bullish reversal pattern carved out in the last five weeks.  Notably, trading volumes jumped 54.6 percent to $7.73 billion on Friday, according to CoinMarketCap data. The rise represents the first time volume has passed $7 billion since Dec. 24 and the highest reading in nearly three months. Further, the three-day average of 24-hour trading volumes has jumped well above $6 billion for the first time since Dec. 25.  The bullish breakout, therefore, looks to have legs and prices could soon crack the 50-day moving average (MA), which has has been serving as a strong resistance since Friday.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,595 on Bitstamp, representing an 8.2 percent gain on the January low of $3,322. The 50-day MA is currently located at $3,642.  Daily chart        BTC's jump to highs above $3,700 confirmed a falling wedge breakout, but failed to close above the 50-day MA, as per the daily chart.  While that average hurdle, currently at $3,642, has capped upside in the last 48 hours, the strong volumes suggest it could be passed soon.  Further, the 5- and 10-day MAs are trending north, having produced a bullish crossover over the weekend and the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is also reporting bullish conditions with an above-50 reading.  As a result, BTC could soon rise toward $3,800 (Jan. 19 high) and possibly to the psychological resistance of $4,000.  6-hour chart  A convincing break above the 50-candle MA on the 6-hour chart also supports the bullish reversal seen on the daily chart. Acting as resistance, the MA had blocked several attempted corrective rallies over the last three weeks.  Weekly chart  BTC rose by 6.9 percent last week – the biggest weekly rise since mid-December – amid bearish exhaustion signaled by the slide in volumes in the last 10 weeks.  The cryptocurrency closed last week above the 10-week MA, neutralizing the immediate bearish view. Further, the 5- and 10-week MAs have shed bearish bias (are flatlined).

42430171,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMoodh,1549879811,SEC Commissioner Peirce Confirms Guidance on Crypto Tokens Is Coming,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to clarify when securities laws might apply to crypto token sales, an official said Friday.  In a speech at the University of Missouri School of Law, Hester Peirce, one of the SEC's commissioners, said that the agency's staff are working on “supplemental guidance” to help projects determine “whether their crypto-fundraising efforts fall under the securities laws.”  While the Howey test – the U.S. standard for determining whether something is a security – generally provides clarity, she said, there is a “need to tread carefully” as token offerings do not always resemble traditional securities offering.  For instance, capital raised from decentralized token offerings could mean it is not truly owned or controlled by a company or person, unlike with traditional securities which are controlled by issuers or promoters, Peirce explained, citing a report from Coin Center.  The application of Howey test can also be “overly broad,” the commissioner added. She did not provide an idea as to when the guidance might be issued.  In November 2018, William Hinman, SEC director of corporation finance, also said that the regulator intends to release “plain English” guidance for developers on when and how crypto tokens may be classified as securities.  On the subject of cryptocurrency regulations, Peirce continued to say, “ambiguity is not all bad,” and that the delays in bringing regulatory clarity may, in fact, allow “more freedom” for blockchain technology to grow and projects to mature.  The commissioner further said that the SEC is also mulling whether new rules need to be put in place to regulate the crypto space, adding:  “If we act appropriately, we can enable innovation on this new frontier to proceed without compromising the objectives of our securities laws – protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and ensuring fair, orderly, and efficient markets.”  Peirce argued that the SEC sometimes can be “impulsive” in dealing with crypto project and offerings. ""We owe it to investors to be careful, but we also owe it to them not to define their investment universe with our preferences,” she said.

42381517,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9n4Dz,1549875638,NYSE Parent ICE Anticipates Over $20 Million Spend on Bakkt This Year,"Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, estimates it will spend more than $20 million this year building Bakkt, its bitcoin futures trading and custody platform.  In an earnings call for Q4, 2018, on Feb. 7, Scott Hill, ICE's chief financial officer, said the firm's investment in Bakkt will result in $20 million to $25 million of its estimated expenses for the fiscal year 2019.  The estimation comes just six weeks after Bakkt announced a massive $182 million fundraise for its bid to roll out the trading platform with regulatory approval. However, the platform's live launch has been postponed two times, a situation exacerbated by the recent U.S. government shutdown, as it works to get the green light from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  In the earnings call, ICE CEO Jeff Sprecher said the company's investment in Bakkt is ""a bit of a moonshot bet"" and is not a typical ICE product. The platform's infrastructure, though, has attracted some ""very, very interesting"" companies for investment such as Microsoft's venture fund and Starbucks.  Sprecher went on to say he expects Bakkt to do other rounds of financing in the future. Currently, Bakkt is a separate company with ICE as the majority investor, but it may be fully spun off at a later stage, he said.  The CEO was once more vague about Bakkt's launch timeline, however, and only said users could expect to see it live ""later this year.""  With market anticipation of Bakkt's launch building, last week fraudsters made an attempt to use the Bakkt brand to con users out of their bitcoin.  The impersonators sent out emails claiming Bakkt will be launched on March 12 and would hold another round of financing to raise $50 million. They asked prospective investors to register and send crypto to a fake Bakkt website that CoinDesk confirmed has no official association with the platform.

42381526,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9n4PJ,1549872350,The Fallacy That Blockchain Is Stuck in One Place,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.    ___________    One of the biggest rhetorical challenges blockchain advocates confront is something I’ll call “stasism:” their critics’ false assumption that the technology is in stasis, that it will never reach its potential because, in its current state, it’s too cumbersome, expensive or inefficient.  This, I believe, is one of two flaws in a widely circulated anti-blockchain screed by Bruce Schneier, who made no reference to the ongoing work of engineers, regulators, and business leaders who are constantly improving this new value exchange system so it can eventually work at scale in the real world. (The other flaw is that in attacking the myth of a “trustless” world where “math is law,” he created a straw man, since only the most naïve proponents of this technology share that nightmare vision of a system devoid of human authority.)  But the purpose of this column is not to pick a fight with Schneier, one of the smartest, most respected minds in IT security. That strikes me as a risky undertaking.  Instead, I want to point out a few breakthroughs from the past couple of weeks that have reinforced my belief in the ongoing inventiveness of the people working in this industry and, by extension, in the technology’s vast potential. This is not, by any means, an industry in stasis.  There are no doubt countless other new ideas and breakthroughs worthy of attention that won’t get a mention here. (I’m quite certain my Twitter mentions will again fill up with people accusing me of bias for not including their favorite new coin project.) So treat these merely as examples of a much wider creative process.  What I can say is that these ones stood out to me because they come from outside the box. This is how challenges faced by new technologies are always solved: by looking at the problem differently.  Decentralized settlement  Consider Abra’s new product offering  : a non-custodial wallet that uses the bitcoin blockchain to allow investors to get fractionalized exposure to the price movements of real-world capital market assets such as stocks, bonds and ETFs, all with as little as $5 down.  The service combines smart contracts, price feeds, and automated, on-chain execution to allow short-term price bets to be rolled over or settled in bitcoin without Abra taking custody of private keys or assets, according to the company. The model opens a host of new possibilities for disintermediated investment markets.  We’ll have to see how regulators react if this product takes off, but for now it looks as if Abra’s design has done an ingenious runaround of existing commodity and swaps trading rules. Abra is working under legal guidance that, because contracts created using its app will be rolled over or settled with “physical” delivery of bitcoin, and because the company has no role in that clearing process or in the custody of a customers’ keys, it is exempt from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's registration requirements.  Why this idea most matters, I believe, is that it leverages the power of bitcoin, not as a currency per se, but as an immutable, decentralized settlement system. The bearer instrument aspect of bitcoin is integral to the design, as it becomes the “commodity” being delivered, but it’s the prospect of decentralized, smart contract-executed settlement that contains the real power of this idea.  All the legal, regulatory and intermediation costs that go into protecting people’s rights in existing derivatives contracts, with multiple middlemen, lawyers and compliance officers taking their cut, are absorbed instead by the consensus-driven decentralized network running the blockchain.  It’s an outside-the-box model that opens up many possibilities.  The combination of the Internet of Things and non-fungible tokens means that a wider array of assets, whether physical goods or digital products, will soon be given tradable digital representation. Abra-style contracts could allow efficient hedging mechanisms and synthetic investment strategies to evolve around what is an almost endless array of assets.  Custody-free exchanges  What you still need, of course, are exchanges that match buyers and sellers of the underlying assets so that they enjoy efficient and effective price discovery (the price signal upon which Abra’s model depends). In essence, markets need a “place” for investors to meet and trade and a trustworthy means of broadcasting the price they agree to.  The problem is that investors have until now had to trust retail exchanges with custody of their crypto assets. These have been frequently hacked or subject to double-spends, creating a security hole that Schneier cited as a core reason people can’t trust public blockchains. This risk was also spectacularly brought home by the stunning story of QuadrigaCX’s failure following the reported death of its CEO.  So, what if investors could tap an exchange’s much-needed capacity for “matching” but retain full custody of their assets until they’re transferred to a buyer? That’s what Arwen, formerly known as Commonwealth Crypto, is aiming to achieve with the testnet release of its technology, now being used in beta form by crypto exchange KuCoin.  Arwen’s tech offers further validation for the development of “Layer 2” solutions that revolve around the combination of smart contracts, multi-signature lock-ups of assets, and “atomic swaps.” Other ideas for decentralized asset trading are being developed on top the Lightning Network and by projects such as the Komodo Platform.  Add to these advances the work on security token offerings, or STOs, by the likes of Polymath, Swarm and Securrency and we can start to imagine a future in which fractionalized claims of any size on mainstream, real-world assets are traded in a peer-to-peer manner and settled in real-time with very low risk.  Momentum  Yes, there’s a lot of work that needs to go into all these projects to make them viable. And, yes, we still need to achieve scalability of the underlying functionality of blockchains, which involves some trade-offs. And, yes, there is a tendency among some crypto zealots to hype the ideas spawned by this technology in utopian terms.  But the people who will change the world are focused on building, not hyping. And they’re working on top of mostly open-source software that lets them collaborate, iterate, test and constantly improve their ideas.  Those are the people making progress in scaling challenges, with both on- and off-chain solutions, and they are the people who are thinking outside the box to build exciting new trading applications such those highlighted here.  If such work weren’t being done, well, sure, you could dismiss this field as an over-hyped, impractical solution in search of a problem.  But, just as it would have been wrong to assume that the Internet’s usability would forever be confined by the snail pace of 14.4 kbps dial-up modems, so too is it misguided to assume that blockchain technology is stuck in one place.

42381536,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9n4bt,1549861205,Most Crypto Hedge Funds Aren’t Really Hedge Funds,"Sina Nader is the founder of CryptoLux Capital, a private asset management firm. Daniel Cawrey is CEO of Pactum Capital, a crypto hedge fund, market maker and liquidity provider.    ------------------    If it walks like a VC, talks like a VC and acts like a VC, it’s probably not a hedge fund. And yet numerous crypto fund managers who’ve launched in the last few years have opted for the hedge fund model. Many of them probably should have gone with a venture capital structure.  Traditionally, hedge funds are measured on their performance over short, discrete periods of time. Months, quarters and years. This makes sense for established markets such as stocks. Price discovery is immediate – one can look up the price of Apple or Netflix pretty quickly.  This could also work for crypto funds, but only if they invest in assets that can be priced immediately (e.g., BTC, ETH, etc.). Otherwise, they may have been better off with a venture capital fund structure.  A Bad Setup  There is evidence that many crypto funds launched with a less-than-ideal structure: prominent crypto hedge funds are now launching venture funds. Some are doing this while blocking investors from pulling capital from the original hedge funds.  In addition, several funds are now using something called side pockets. A mechanism to make long-term, illiquid investments, side pockets cannot be properly valued by a market because there generally isn’t one. Many funds invest in project tokens or take equity stakes in crypto companies. However, these are investments in assets that cannot be valued precisely.  This is because most of these early crypto projects don’t trade freely on an open market. And so, a crypto hedge fund starts to look and feel more like a venture capital fund.  The issue with many crypto hedge funds is a natural preference that skews toward venture-style rather than hedge fund-style investment. They are more comfortable making long-term investments. And this is a fundamental flaw when you try to wrap it in a hedge fund structure that is short-term focused.  It creates a situation where the hedge fund manager may actually be right, but get penalized for it. They may invest in some crypto asset that becomes widely used for distributed file storage, for example. However, the investment gets destroyed on a yearly performance basis. This is because before the investment thesis was confirmed, the crypto asset fell off a cliff several times on its way to the top.  The Curious Case of 'Crypto Hedge Fund' Performance  Let’s take the case of ABC Crypto Fund (not its real name).  ABC is run by a team of highly accomplished technologists hailing from Ivy League schools. ABC finished 2018 down over 70 percent. The managers of ABC do not have any professional money management experience. It appears they have not entertained the possibility that their love for the tech they selected may not be aligned with current market sentiment. Otherwise, perhaps their current outcome would be different.  Or consider XYZ Crypto Fund (again, not its real name). XYZ is run by vocal technologists who publish their views with a tone and conviction so fervent that it would embarrass a religious extremist. Reading their thought pieces, one might think they had achieved union with the sacred energy permeating the universe. It feels like they are granting mere mortals a peek behind the curtain to see the inner workings of the cosmos, expressed in crypto terminology.  So what happened with XYZ? Lost about half of their investors’ money in 2018. The irony is that they even tout their fund’s similarity to VC funds— but alas, they elected to organize themselves as a hedge fund.  We wish managers like ABC and XYZ well and hope that they ultimately succeed. We are long-term believers in crypto and digital assets. But we also have to call a spade a spade.  In fairness, it may have been difficult to predict what the optimal structure should have been for crypto funds. Hindsight is 20/20. If we look at things dispassionately, we see many fund managers who espouse a venture-style view, attempting to hold investments in a hedge fund vehicle.  Said another way, they have a 5- or 10-year horizon (like a VC), but they’ve packaged their funds in a short-term delivery vehicle (like a hedge fund manager). Perhaps this is why, when asked about their 2018 performance, they often say that they’re “investing for the long term.” Also that the technological promise is so great, that being “distracted by returns in the short term” is a mistake.  In certain situations, a hedge fund model does make sense for crypto. Some of the best performing crypto funds of 2018 were structured as hedge funds. Rightly so—they employed specific strategies that make sense for a hedge fund structure. Suffice it to say the hedge model can work well. Some funds finished 2018 with double-digit positive returns even as some of the most prominent funds were slaughtered.  Rose-Colored Enthusiasm  Market forces will eventually sort things out after a requisite period of fairly intense pain. In the meantime, the time is right to bring a more realistic view to the crypto investment space.  Hope and enthusiasm for technology are great. But certain principles of finance have persisted throughout the centuries for good reason. Technology may well change the world for the better. However, economics and market forces cannot be out-coded and should certainly not be over-engineered.  The problem is one cannot have both. No one investing in tokens can reasonably say it is for the long term. If they truly had a long-term focus, these investors might as well invest in regular seed/series A rounds.  So, if you want to get into the game of picking the winning technologies in crypto, do yourself and your investors a favor. Call yourself by your proper name: A venture capitalist.
