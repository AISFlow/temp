42430145,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMTU9h,1548973143,Crypto Exchange QuadrigaCX Files for Creditor Protection,"Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX is filing for protection from creditors, a step taken to avoid bankruptcy.  In a statement posted to its website nearly a week after the portal became inaccessible, the exchange announced that it had filed ""an application for creditor protection in accordance with the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act,"" as part of a move to ""address"" financial issues.  In its application, QuadrigaCX is asking the Nova Scotia Supreme Court to appoint professional services firm Ernst & Young to act as independent third party to oversee its proceedings.  The act, according to PwC, allows ""financially troubled"" companies a chance to ""restructure their affairs."" Filing an application is generally done to try and avoid bankruptcy under Canadian law, as well as provide creditors to ""receive some form of payment.""  Details of QuadrigaCX's filing were not immediately available.  The statement continued:  ""For the past weeks, we have worked extensively to address our liquidity issues, which include attempting to locate and secure our very significant cryptocurrency reserves held in cold wallets, and that are required to satisfy customer cryptocurrency balances on deposit, as well as sourcing a financial institution to accept the bank drafts that are to be transferred to us.""  ""Unfortunately, these efforts have not been successful,"" it said.  The company plans to release further updates after a hearing, which it is hoping will occur on Feb. 5.  Withdrawal delays  The exchange has been facing issues for some time now, with customers complaining about withdrawal problems with both fiat and cryptocurrencies on social media.  The exchange's problems with fiat withdrawals stemmed – at least in part – with a now-concluded legal battle against the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which froze much of QuadrigaCX's funds last year.  A court ultimately ruled that QuadrigaCX should get the funds back, minus a portion, but its payment processor, Billerfy, told CoinDesk that it could not find a banking partner to endorse the drafts, meaning it was unable to send any fiat currencies to the exchange and therefore the exchange could not process withdrawals.  In an email to customers earlier this month, interim QuadrigaCX CEO Aaron Matthews said the exchange was hoping to process customer withdrawals ""within the next two weeks.""  It was unclear why customers encountered delays with crypto withdrawals, although Thursday's statement suggests that the exchange is not currently in possession of its cold wallets or keys.  QuadrigaCX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42413903,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAmcqL,1548962285,Cboe Resubmits the VanEck/SolidX Bitcoin ETF Proposal for SEC Approval,"The race is back on to launch the first U.S. bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), after Cboe resubmitted its joint proposal with VanEck and SolidX.  Announced Thursday by VanEck digital asset strategy lead Gabor Gurbacs, the Jan. 30 filing would, if approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), allow the Cboe BZX Exchange to list shares of a bitcoin ETF trust. Many proponents of a bitcoin ETF believe that the fund will help bring fresh money into the space, creating a more liquid market.  The proposal was withdrawn from consideration earlier this month due to the U.S. government shutdown. At the time, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck explained that the companies filing the rule change proposal had been in talks with the SEC, but these talks ended when the shutdown began. To avoid a probable rejection due to the closure, the proposal was withdrawn.  Prior to that, the VanEck/SolidX filing was facing a final decision date of Feb. 27, after the SEC extended its examination period a number of times.  The rule change proposal has not yet been published in the Federal Register, meaning the clock has not yet begun for the SEC to make a decision. Once the proposal is published, the SEC will have a maximum of 240 days to decide whether to approve or reject the proposal.  Cboe's filing comes weeks after NYSE Arca filed its own proposal with Bitwise Asset Management. Like Cboe's filing, the NYSE Arca proposal has not yet been published in the Federal Register, meaning it too, is not facing any deadlines yet.  However, January 31's copy of the Federal Register did include news Cboe's previous withdrawal, dated January 23.

42430158,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMTUTh,1548961217,Prime Trust Undercuts Rivals in Crypto Custody Race,"Prime Trust won't charge its clients to custody digital assets any longer.  The Nevada trust company announced Thursday that, effective immediately, it had lowered its fee for storing cryptocurrencies and tokens to $0, in line with what it charges to custody stocks and bonds.  Prime Trust began to custody crypto assets last year, when it offered cold storage services for bitcoin. It later expanded its custody offerings to include ether, ERC-20 tokens and Stellar lumens.  Crypto custodians typically charge custody fees ranging from 4 to 10 basis points per month, Prime Trust said Thursday. Dropping this charge makes it cheaper and faster for Prime Trust's clientele – which includes crowdfunding portals, exchanges, broker-dealers and stablecoin platforms – to conduct operations.  Explaining the move in an email, Prime Trust CEO and chief trust officer Scott Purcell noted that in the traditional finance world, ""no qualified custodian"" charges fees for safekeeping stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), mutual funds or real estate, citing examples such as Etrade, Robinhood, Northern Trust and JPMorgan (though Prime Trust does charge a $350 annual custody fee for real estate, according to its fee schedule).  As such, charging a custody fee just because the asset is a crypto token did not make sense, he added. The move aims to ""conform to standard practice"" in the financial industry, although he claimed Prime Trust was the first in crypto to nix custody fees.  No free lunch  Purcell told CoinDesk that Prime Trust has other sources of revenue to make up for the removal of custody fees, explaining:  ""We make money just as Robinhood, Northern Trust and other traditional custodians do. The costs of custody are offset by other services.""  For example, he said, customers who store crypto with Prime Trust also often park their fiat there, and the institution can earn interest on the latter.  According to The Clearing House, a banking association and payments firm, at traditional custodians, these other services can include fund administration, securities brokerage, payments, lending, performance data and asset servicing, all of which typically carry their own specific fee. Interest income from reinvested client funds also typically make up ""an important component"" of custodians' revenue, TCH's white paper on custodial services said.  When asked if Prime Trust could lend out digital assets the way traditional custodians lend customers' securities, Purcell said, ""we're exploring that.""  Prime Trust does charge a $50 disbursement fee for processing crypto assets, as well as any additional costs that may be incurred such as gas prices on the ether network.

Cottonwood Vending LLC was granted one of the virtual currency licenses Thursday, the New York Department of Financial Services announced on Twitter, joining a select group of fewer than 20 crypto companies to receive regulatory approval to operate within the Empire State.  The agency has been ramping up its awarding of its virtual currency licenses recently, with three awarded in January 2019 alone, compared to only one granted both in 2015 and 2016, and two in 2017.  Coinsource  was the first bitcoin ATM operator to receive the license, which was awarded in November 2017 after a three-year application process. LibertyX joined it earlier this month, announcing that it would allow individuals to purchase bitcoin using debit cards at traditional ATMs.  Automated kiosks for buying bitcoin in the U.S. are becoming increasingly popular, with money changer Coinstar announcing earlier this month that it would enable such purchases in a number of states. While at launch, customers can only purchase bitcoin at specific stores in California, Texas and Washington, however, the company plans to expand to other parts of the country going forward.  In an email, Cottonwood CEO and founder Aniello Zampella told CoinDesk that the general public can purchase bitcoin using cash at any of the company's machines. Select machines will also allow customers to sell bitcoin for physical cash.  ""We are delighted to continue to offer the opportunity of trading bitcoin at our many locations to all those who sign up with us,"" Zampella said, adding:  ""It is a monumental personal achievement of mine, and also acknowledges all the hard work and tireless efforts of my support & compliance staff over the years to maintain a 24/7 safe, secure, and reliable financial service.

After a year in development, the firm announced Thursday, the Bison app is now available on iOS 9+ and Android 4.4+ devices in Germany, and will allow users to trade in bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), litecoin (LTC) and XRP and fund their accounts with euros.  The app launches with zero trading fees and also provides a built-in wallet for storing tokens, Boerse Stuttgart said. Users can currently only trade between 6 a.m. and midnight CET (05:00 and 23:00 UTC), though that is expected to expand later. The app will derive its profits from the spread between the buying and selling prices offered.  For the Bison product, the group is partnering with its financial services subsidiary EUWAX AG, which will actually conduct the trades. Another subsidiary, Blocknox GmbH, is handling custody of the cryptocurrencies, according to the announcement.  Germany’s SolarisBank AG is acting as external banking partner for payments processing and custody of customers’ cash deposits, which are protected under the country's statutory deposit guarantee, the firm said. Meanwhile, Sowa Labs, a subsidiary of Boerse Stuttgart Digital Ventures, developed the app.  Sowa CEO Ulli Spankowski said that additional features will be added to Bison over the next year, including extending trading to 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and adding support for more cryptocurrencies.  Bison is also planned to expand to other European countries later this year.  Boerse Stuttgart Group has previously said it plans to launch an initial coin offering (ICO) platform, which is currently under development. The platform would allow token issuers to conduct token sales with “standardized and transparent processes,” it said in August 2018, as well as a “multilateral trading venue for cryptocurrencies"" and custody solutions.

42430161,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMTUXh,1548948089,A New Test Network Just Activated and Ethereum 2.0 Will Be Using It,"A highly anticipated upgrade to ethereum is gearing up for its first dry run, and the test network of choice will be an unfamiliar name to many.  Launched today, the Görli blockchain will be the proving ground for Prysm, software created by Prysmatic Labs that will feature the first of three phases of deployment of the upgrade, often referred to as ethereum 2.0 or Serenity. As such, Görli represents a small step on the long road to solving ethereum's well-known scaling challenges.  Görli is described on the official website as ""the first proof-of-authority cross-client testnet, synching Parity Ethereum, Geth, Nethermind, Pantheon, and EthereumJS."" The website adds that the testnet ""is a community-based project, completely open-source"" that has been in the works since September.  As developer Afri Schoedon, the release manager of the Parity Ethereum client, told CoinDesk:  ""The vision of the Görli testnet is to enable developers for building applications on a reliable, high available testing network without restricting them in the tools they can use.""  And though the community-driven ethos surrounding the creation of Görli is important, Preston Van Loon, co-founder and technical lead of Prysmatic Labs, admitted that there is a different reason why it decided to launch Prysm on this particular test network.  Creating a formal Github request about two weeks prior to Görli's launch, developers at Prysmatic Labs jumped at the opportunity to secure a fixed amount of GöETH – the native currency of the Görli network.  “Using Görli is beneficial because they haven’t started yet so we can ask for a really large amount of tokens in their genesis file. I've asked them for 10 million which is representative of what we might actually need to start ethereum 2.0,” said Van Loon. ""It's like the initial value for launching the test network ... We'll start at block zero with this amount and move on from there.""  Adding that it would be exceedingly difficult to secure this amount of tokens on a test network mid-chain, Van Loon elaborated:  ""I wanted to get enough that we can get a realistic simulation .... and it will be really hard to do this later – to ask for that amount – [after] they launch.""  Still, even in the blockchain space, nothing is achieved without a little give-and-take.  In talks with members of the Görli team about this initial deposit of GöETH, Van Loon said that in exchange, Prysmatic Labs has agreed to run a node that will connect to and support validation of the Görli testnet.  “We've volunteered to run a node for them in exchange for this and so we're helping each other out in that sense and we're totally happy to do that ... The talks have been so far [about] can we work together, can we support you and you'll support us kind of thing,” said Van Loon.  The road map  Stepping back, Prysm itself will not launch on the new testnet until February or March, Van Loon said.  As explained by ethereum core developer Justin Drake during an “Ask Me Anything” Reddit forum last week, the full Serenity upgrade is envisioned to be rolled out piecemeal onto the main ethereum blockchain.  Phase zero – the one that will be tested by Prysmatic Labs – will include, among other features, a beacon chain, or a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain functioning as the ""heartbeat"" of the new ethereum network, as ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin put it on a Reddit thread.  As a caveat, Van Loon told CoinDesk the release would not be ""a 100 percent complete phase zero implementation,"" explaining that validators do not stand to lose their staked ether if they misbehave.  He said:  “When our test net launches, it’s going to be making assumptions that everybody is honest. So the penalty system I don’t think will be there on the day we launch but that's not the point yet. That’s going to come later. The point is do these have connectivity and does the chain advance over longer periods of time.""  The other test network  In fact, Prysm will be operating on two test networks.  By staking a set amount of GöETH, users of the Görli network will be able to participate on a separate Prysm test network as “validators.”  As Van Loon explained, these validators are basically the new miners of ethereum 2.0. In phase zero of Serenity, they will either “produce a block as a block producer or attest to newly produced blocks [as] valid and it exists.”  As such, Görli will actually function as the test network to initiate new validators, while a separate test network engineered by Prysmatic Labs and featuring beacon chain technology will monitor the activity and ""work"" of these transaction validators.  On the latter system, developers will make sure the on-boarding process for new validators, in which they must stake a certain amount of GöETH before being assigned roles to perform, goes smoothly.  The big picture  While this is a partial “phase zero implementation” excluding key elements of ethereum 2.0 such as sharding which comes in later phases, Van Loon adds that the testnet launch will be useful for a number of other reasons.  For example, he told CoinDesk:  “The purpose of the testnet is to explore connectivity between other [software] clients, so we’re hoping that we’ll launch ours and then another team will launch their test network and we can have ours talking to each other and start finding problems sooner rather than later.""  But perhaps the most important reason Van Loon highlighted is that up until this point ethereum 2.0 had only materialized into proofs-of-concept and demos. A prototype, he said, while ""it looks cool and it's exciting, doesn't really mean much.""  ""We want to give someone who's interested in this something to play with because when you download a demo you're talking to yourself ... Having this actual representation of a blockchain network is going to be important,"" Van Loon said.  Speaking to this though during a developer call about Serenity, ethereum core developer Danny Ryan warned client teams like Prysmatic Labs to first target “your client to speak to other versions of your client.""  “I think demonstrating internal networks within a singular client is more sane,"" said Ryan in the call. ""And just going to keep you from, one, having to keep the [specifications] from having to harden entirely and, two, there could be a lot of time wasted until we iron out some of these bugs … I would imagine the release today has critical bugs.  Looking ahead, Van Loon added that in terms of continued research and development on ethereum 2.0, ethereum researchers are actually ahead of implementors like Prysmatic Labs and other client teams.

42430146,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMTUBh,1548943257,"Pantera, Coinbase Join $4.5 Million Round for Staking-as-a-Service Startup","Blockchain investment firm Pantera Capital is leading a $4.5 million seed round in Staked, a startup that provides institutional investors with the technical infrastructure for non-custodial staking services.  Other participants in the round include Coinbase Ventures, Global Brain, Digital Currency Group, Winklevoss Capital, Fabric Ventures and Blocktree Capital.  ""You've got $25 billion of stake-able crypto that's coming online in the next 15 months,"" Staked CEO and co-founder Tim Ogilvie told CoinDesk, describing what he sees as a large opportunity. The idea behind Staked is that investors can compound their crypto by participating in the validation process of proof-of-stake blockchains.  “Pantera invests in many leading proof-of-stake projects, so we knew we needed a staking solution,” Pantera partner Paul Veradittakit said in a press release. Pantera first approached Staked as a customer before deciding to invest. (Last November, Veradittakit spoke about opportunities for earning through staking from the main stage of CoinDesk's Consensus: Invest.)  ""Our cap table is all people who have stake or can influence stake,"" Ogilvie said of his investors. ""Everybody is basically a customer or potential partner.""  Ogilvie started Staked last March alongside Seth Riney and Jonathan Marcus, working with Multicoin Capital as an early client. Ogilvie said he started talking to customers more broadly in May and started to see traction in the fall.  Staked lets its customers determine the protocols it builds infrastructure for. Ogilvie explained that if Staked provides services for a given token, that's because someone with significant holdings came to them looking for a solution.  Right now, the startup supports Tezos, Dash, Decred, Livepeer, Factom and EOS. The latter two, it should be noted, don't provide a return for staking (EOS potentially can, but the technical hurdle is considerable); nevertheless, investors want to be able to participate in these networks fully.  More cryptocurrencies will be added, Ogilvie said, projecting that 20 coins will come online in 2019.  Handling the details  Anyone who digs into staking knows that there's a lot of variation between protocols. Staking on Tezos, for example, is fixed. A user stakes and they are likely to earn money proportionally at a steady rate.  On the other hand, Decred uses a more intermittent staking approach where users buy tickets on an open market that pay out less predictably.  Staked allows holders to turn these complexities over to a team that will sort out optimizing them and handle a lot of the ongoing issues like updates and upgrades.  Staked's basic business model gives it a maximum of 10 percent of the earnings of its customers' staked tokens. There is a caveat, though: Staked only gets the full 10 percent if it hits 100 percent uptime. Its earnings shrink proportionally with the amount of time it goes offline.  Beyond institutional investors, Staked also provides a white label version that can be used by consumer-facing companies, such as exchanges and wallets. So an exchange could use Staked to set up a way for its customers to delegate their XTZ to a baker without taking them off the exchange.  Up next: lending  ""Passive yield is a big opportunity,"" Ogilvie said.  To expand customer options, Staked will also build ways for token holders to put their assets into platforms that allow them to lend their holdings out, such as dy/dx, Dharma and Compound.  ""We're going to build a smart contract that allows you to get the best rate from all the best options that exist out there,"" Ogilvie said.  For his part, this is going precisely to Compund founder Robert Leshner's plan: ""Compound was designed for other applications and businesses to be built on top of the protocol,"" he told CoinDesk. ""Long-term, we hope they take over the user experience, and we can retire our web interface completely.""  Staked is open now to anyone for any of its supported protocols.  ""We're one size fits all. You can delegate to us,"" Ogilvie said. ""If you were to go to the yield page on our site, and click on Livepeer or Tezos, we'll give you the details on how to delegate to us.""  That said, Staked is really designed with the large-scale user in mind – funds, wallets, exchanges and the like.  Those large holders are looking now for any way to take some of the sting out of a bear market, Ogilvie said:  ""If your coins are going up 100x in a few months you probably don't care as much about a 10 to 15 percent yield. Nowadays, people are probably looking for an edge wherever they can get it.""

42430148,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMTUDh,1548936020,Binance Users Can Now Pay for Crypto With Credit Cards,"Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by adjusted trading volume, has just made it easier for users to buy cryptocurrencies.  The exchange announced Thursday that it has partnered with Israel-based payments processing firm Simplex to enable purchases with Visa and MasterCard credit cards.  At launch, the exchange is supporting credit card purchase for bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC) and XRP. These can then be traded against up to 151 other tokens offered by the exchange.  “The crypto industry is still in its early stages and most of the world’s money is still in fiat, "" said Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. ""Building fiat gateways is what we need now to grow the ecosystem, increase adoption and introduce crypto to more users.""  According to Binance's terms and conditions pages, some countries are excluded from the service, including Iraq, Cuba Afghanistan and Libya. In the U.S., six states are also not supported, New York, Connecticut, Hawaii, Georgia, New Mexico and Washington.  Regarding fees, Simplex charges 3.5 percent of a transaction with a $10 minimum (flat fee). The daily limit is $20,000 per user, while the monthly max is $50,000 per user.  The firm adds: ""Simplex payment processing is subject to local bank policies. Some issuer banks may decline charges on their own terms, regardless if users reside in a supported jurisdiction.""  Founded in 2014, Simplex raised $7 million in a Series A funding round in February 2016. The investors included mining firms Bitmain and Cumberland Mining, crowdfunding platform FundersClub (which previously invested in Coinbase), among others. Back in November, the payments firm partnered with Singapore-based crypto exchange KuCoin to enable traders purchase bitcoin, ether and litecoin through credit and debit cards payments.  Binance earlier this month launched a new fiat-to-crypto exchange on the island of Jersey, a British self-governing dependency, enabling users to trade bitcoin and ethereum against the British pound and the euro. It also opened shop in Uganda last October , allowing crypto trading against the country's fiat currency, the Ugandan shilling.

42430163,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMTUfh,1548933305,"February Is Often Good for Bitcoin Prices, Will History Repeat in 2019?","View  The probability of bitcoin ending its four-year February winning streak in 2019 is high, as the primary trend is bearish for the first time in the last three years. Further, BTC's failure to capitalize on a bullish pattern on the 3-day chart indicates bearish sentiment is still quite strong.  BTC risks falling to December lows near $3,100 in the next few days.  The odds of BTC ending February in the green would rise sharply if prices see a strong bounce from the crucial 200-week moving average at $3,298.  Bitcoin could end its four-year February winning streak unless prices see a strong bounce from key support.  The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization gained 16, 18, 23.5 and 1.6 percent in the second month of 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  BTC generally posts losses in January before putting on a good show in February. The January losing streak looks certain to extend to the fifth year running with a close tonight in the negative.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,414, representing a 7 percent drop from the monthly opening price of $3,693.  if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""]={},window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-SXOv6""),window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""SXOv6""==b)window.datawrapper[""SXOv6""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""});  As seen above, BTC has posted gains in February in five out of the last seven years.  January was a good month for the cryptocurrency during the three year period of 2012–2014.  BTC is reporting losses in January for the fifth consecutive year.  However, the odds of bitcoin posting gains in February for the fifth year straight are quite low, as the recent drop to six-week lows has put the bears back in a commanding position.  The bearish setup, however, would weaken if the crucial 200-week moving average support, currently at $3,298, holds ground for the second time in two months. That could yield a sustained rally to $4,000.  Monthly chart  The above chart shows the 5- and 10-month MAs are trending south and BTC is trading well below these averages for the first time since 2015.  Put simply, the primary trend heading into February is bearish, while bullish conditions prevailed in the previous three years. Hence, BTC may have a hard time posting sustainable gains in the next four weeks.  3-day chart  BTC jumped above $4,000 in mid-December, confirming a bullish divergence of the RSI – a strong indicator of a bearish-to-bullish trend change.  The follow-through to that trend reversal, however, has been anything but bullish. Moreover, prices fell to six-week lows earlier this week.  BTC’s inability to produce significant gains despite the RSI divergence indicates the bearish sentiment is still quite strong.  Weekly chart  On the weekly chart, BTC has carved out a bearish-lower high above $4,000, reinforcing the negative view put forward by the downward sloping 10-week MA.  The cryptocurrency, therefore, could soon revisit December lows near $3,100. A violation there would establish fresh lower low and open the doors for a deeper drop below $3,000.  The probability of BTC posting gains in February would improve if the 200-week MA, currently at $3,298, again serves as strong support. That average had put brakes on the sell-off in December and was followed by a corrective bounce to levels above $4,000.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

The FSC decision was informed by the results of a survey conducted by the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), indicating that some ICOs purportedly conducted abroad had also illegally raised money from Korean investors.  From September 2018, the FSS sent the survey questionnaire 22 local firms that conducted ICOs in foreign countries, of which 13 responded. The companies had held the ICOs since the second half of 2017, raising a combined total of about 566.4 billion won ($509 million).  The research found that firms had been setting up paper companies in Singapore to circumvent the ICO ban, yet still raised money from Koreans – as evidenced by Korean language white papers and marketing materials.  Some ICO projects also did not disclose important information for investors such as company profile and financial statements, and in some cases provided false information, the survey found. The risk for investors was also deemed high because the value of the projects' tokens had fallen by an average of 67.7 percent since launch.  The South Korean government had previously said it would make a decision in November on whether it would again allow initial coin offerings (ICOs) again in the country.  Hong Nam-ki, head of the office for government policy coordination, said in October that regulators in the country have been reviewing the topic in recent months and that the FSC survey would guide decision-making for the policy.

IOTA co-founder and board co-chairman Dominik Schiener told Reuters that the funds are currently being held as evidence in a police investigation.  As reported on Jan. 24, a Europol-coordinated effort involving British and German law enforcement agencies arrested a 36-year old man suspected of stealing $11.4 million in iota from at least 85 victims worldwide since last January.  The investigation found that the thefts took place by targeting users of a now-defunct website that created 81-digit security seeds for iota wallets. The alleged hacker managed to retrieve the seeds stored on the website to gain access to users' iota wallets and drain the funds.  Iota had been assisting the police investigation for several months, Schiener said, adding that what they'd thought was an organized hacker group turned out to be one individual “who had a normal job and is well-educated.”  ""Just a small amount"" of the stolen cryptocurrency has not yet been found, he told Reuters, adding: ""The exchanges have blocked the hacker’s accounts.

42430152,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMTULh,1548903620,"NEM Foundation, Nearly Broke, Plans Layoffs and Pivot","The NEM Foundation, a community-funded nonprofit established to promote the NEM blockchain, is planning layoffs across its entire 150-person staff in the wake of severe budget cuts and ahead of an imminent restructuring, CoinDesk has learned.  The newly elected president of the NEM Foundation, Alex Tinsman, told CoinDesk Wednesday the Singapore-based NEM Foundation now intends to submit a funding request to the NEM community fund for 160 million tokens (worth roughly $7.5 million), money that would be used to rescue the organization.  NEM tokens are listed under the XEM ticker with a circulating supply of 9 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. At press time, XEM is the world’s 18th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  “Basically we realized we had a month to operate, due to the mismanagement of the previous governance council,” Tinsman, who took over the non-profit in January, said in an interview.  As a result, the foundation’s 202 members – people who undergo identity checks and pay an annual $50 membership fee – will be asked to vote on the funding request in February after it's published on Thursday. The number of layoffs will be determined by how much funding the community approves, Tinsman said.  NEM's XEM token launched in 2015 under the guidance of former foundation president Lon Wong. The cryptocurrency is primarily used for transaction and service fees on the NEM blockchain. The full launch of the platform’s native engine software, called Catapult, is scheduled for later this year. In the meantime, NEM pilot projects have often focused on use cases such as voting.  Indeed, Tinsman herself was elected in a process that used NEM’s platform.  Tinsman said the foundation spent roughly 80 million XEM between December 2017 and January 2019, primarily on marketing. (Wong did not respond to requests for comment about the foundation's spending.)  “We’ve reduced marketing activities because it doesn’t make sense to market a product [Catapult] that isn’t out yet,” Tinsman said.  According to a longtime NEM user, a developer who asked to stay anonymous because he worked directly with departed leadership, Wong faltered when he used his visibility at the foundation to promote “sketchy” initial coin offerings such as Ecobit and ProximaX.  The ProximaX token sale reportedly raised more than $33 million in 2018 and the company’s website lists Wong as the CEO. The anonymous developer said “the community felt this was a breach of faith,” adding there is still a great deal of work to be done in order to encourage developers like himself to actually use the blockchain.  “There’s not a whole lot of people working on this platform. Even though it's easy, the community isn’t really there unless you go to Japan,” the developer said. “We need more developer traction on this platform.”  Tinsman, a former communications executive at the foundation before 148 registered members elected her to lead the nonprofit, is embarking on a much more disciplined roadmap for 2019.  She said teams will be given specific budgets and required to perform more open-source documentation of their progress making tools for the NEM ecosystem.  “The community will also be voting on these [funding requests] and which ones we should be moving forward with,” she said.  Tinsman further plans to monetize the foundation’s activities in 2019, including enterprise training and affiliate marketing, to reduce the nonprofit’s reliance on community grants.  She described the restructuring as a “positive step,” adding:  “It’s really exciting to me that NEM has a strong suite of tools and a community that is moving forward to change the future. And now we can support them in meaningful ways.”  NEM conference booth image via the NEM Foundation.

The project was first unveiled in October as a joint initiative between decentralized exchange startups Kyber Network and Republic Protocol, as well as cryptocurrency custody company BitGo.  As stated on the project's website, the aim of WBTC is to bring “greater liquidity to the ethereum ecosystem including decentralized exchanges and financial applications.”  At the time, BitGo CTO Benedict Chan described WBTC as possessing both “the stability of bitcoin and the flexibility of ethereum,” likening the new crypto asset to traditional bank notes (the kind that were once redeemable for gold). While volatile compared to the U.S. dollar, bitcoin is the most liquid and stable of cryptocurrencies, he noted.  Now listed on cryptocurrency market data site CoinMarketCap, as of early Wednesday evening there was a reported 72.4214 WBTC on the ethereum network, slightly over-collateralized with 72.4216 BTC (roughly $250,000) locked in custody on the bitcoin blockchain.  Leveraging a technology known as “atomic swaps” to facilitate cross-chain cryptocurrency trades, users on ethereum can request WBTC from certified ""merchants"" after undergoing necessary anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer (AML/KYC) identification procedures.  Playing a key role in the exchange and liquidation of new WBTC tokens, merchants are defined in the technology's white paper as ""the institution or party to which wrapped tokens will be minted to and burnt from.""  According to the WBTC team, there are presently eight merchants to facilitate conversion between WBTC and BTC. These include: AirSwap, Dharma, ETHfinex, GOPAX, Kyber Network, Prycto, Ren and Set Protocol.  Traded on exchanges  In addition, a number of cryptocurrency exchanges have already procured part of the initial WBTC inventory and will be able to support its live supply directly on their respective platforms, according to a WBTC press release.  As well, several financially-focussed decentralized applications on ethereum, including bZx, Compound and dYdX, will allow “immediate usage” of the new token.  As such, despite the concern expressed by the creator of ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, on Twitter over the centralized nature of this token swap system, the press release states:  “The fundamental design of WBTC and the continuing commitment of all member to openness will form the essential building blocks for a transparent process framework and governance structure … WBTC will remain a firmly community-led initiative.”  A $5 National Gold Bank Note issued by the First National Gold Bank of San Francisco, California, image via Wikimedia Commons.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | KNC | SPONSORED,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/01/31/a-bitcoin-backed-stablecoin-has-launched-on-the-ethereum-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d9c462482407fce47efffa8276625974436d1034-1500x651.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
