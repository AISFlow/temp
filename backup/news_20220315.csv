42411489,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOOJ3,1647384640,Joe Biden’s Crypto Executive Order Is a Symbol,"The federal government is coordinating its approach to digital assets, with different agencies and departments tasked with writing reports.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  ‘Whole-of-government’  The narrative  U.S. President Joe Biden announced a “whole-of-government” approach to regulating digital assets in a sweeping executive order directing various government agencies and departments to answer specific questions about cryptocurrencies and blockchain.  Why it matters  This was perhaps the biggest story in the U.S. cryptocurrency world last week. The White House ordered the government to get to work on understanding these magical internet beans. If last year’s infrastructure bill wasn’t enough evidence that crypto is no longer a niche area, last week’s order should put any further doubts to rest.  Breaking it down  President Biden unveiled his executive order on digital assets last Wednesday. Allow me to show you what my inbox looked like after:  Well, folks, it’s finally here: A sitting U.S. president signed an executive order addressing the cryptocurrency industry. And no one hated it?  Seriously, as far as I can tell, this thing’s received near-universal praise. The critiques are along the lines of “it didn’t go far enough” or that it doesn’t actually answer any of the major outstanding questions. But by and large the reception has been pretty positive.  You can read the text of the order here (and my write-up with color from administration officials here); industry reactions here; government official comments here; non-U.S. reactions here; implications for crypto miners here; and central bank digital currency implications here.  I don’t want to get political, but it is worth marveling for a moment at the fact that we went from a president who once tweeted he wasn’t a “fan of bitcoin” to one who signed a formal document saying the crypto industry is growing, it must be monitored, guidelines should be put in place and the U.S. should be a leader in responsible innovation within the digital asset sector.  The real question is whether this actually means anything.  On a practical level, the executive order is more or less telling agencies to keep doing what they’re doing. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen basically said as much (“This work will complement ongoing efforts by Treasury.”) in a statement published to accompany the order.  The order also more explicitly defines the roles of the Commerce Department and National Security Agency in crypto regulation. There are a number of reports (some of which are not referred to as reports) that the various departments will have to produce over the next six months or so.  This isn’t explicitly stated, but it seems to me that one of the main goals is to do away with the state/federal bifurcation of crypto regulation (for those of you who don’t follow this regularly: crypto exchanges are by and large regulated at the state level as money services businesses/money transmitters, while derivatives and tokens that might be seen as securities are regulated at the federal level. There's more to it than that but this is a quick tl;dr).  The key here, I think, will be seeing how these reports are used. Regulatory agencies and government wings like the Treasury Department have already announced guidance or sought specific legislation. The Federal Reserve, for example, has said on numerous occasions that it wants Congress to pass a law authorizing the creation of a central bank digital currency before it will consider issuing a digital dollar.  More reports may lead to more specific recommendations, but that will depend entirely on Congress or the executive branch departments and how they utilize these recommendations. It’s as likely that we’ll continue with the current status quo as it is that we’ll see changes at this moment in time.  Basically, I think it’s too early to have any idea what sort of real impact this might have on a practical level. We might see some consolidation of regulation and a move away from the state/federal split, or we might not. Both seem equally likely at this time.  Because of this, the argument that the directive doesn’t mean a lot makes a certain amount of sense.  On a symbolic level, though, this executive order seems massive.  “The United States must maintain technological leadership in this rapidly growing space, supporting innovation while mitigating the risks for consumers, businesses, the broader financial system and the climate. And, it must play a leading role in international engagement and global governance of digital assets consistent with democratic values and U.S. global competitiveness,” a White House fact sheet announcing the directive said.  The order also addresses concerns we’ve heard about digital assets – that they might lead to financial instability or harm consumers. Once again, the order directs agencies to study these issues.  At no point does the order specify the regulations the administration wants these departments to take.  Next steps: Watching for the reports to roll in.  Banning proof-of-work  I took a few days off and apparently missed a Whole Thing in Europe.  The headline is that Europe’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework is one step closer to adoption. As a quick refresher, this years-in-the-making proposal would create a common regulatory framework for crypto companies trying to conduct business in any of the European Union’s 27 member nations. My colleague Sandali Handagama has a more in-depth explanation here.  Yesterday, the European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee voted to advance a draft of this legislation, which includes provisions for blocking market manipulation and illicit activities, as well as creating a license that a company could seek in one country which would be applicable in the other EU nations.  This seems a pretty significant step, but one could be forgiven for thinking this is the MiCA news that dominated headlines.  Guess not.  Sandali again: “The latest draft of the European Union's (EU) proposed legislative framework for governing virtual currencies, Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), still contains a provision that could limit the use of proof-of-work cryptocurrencies.”  Different drafts of the MiCA legislation included different provisions to limit the impact proof-of-work cryptocurrencies would have on the bloc’s energy usage.  Now, to be clear, the energy concerns have been and continue to be pretty real. Europe in particular is probably grappling with questions around how it might be able to source energy should the EU or U.S. try and implement sanctions on Russian oil, a key source of oil and gas across Europe.  Blocking cryptocurrencies deemed to be “wasting” energy is pretty low-hanging fruit as far as Things They Can Do go.  Sandali reported the vote was too close to call on Sunday, and on Monday the provision was struck from the bill.  The legislation will now go to other EU groups for further negotiations and debate.  Studying blockchain  U.S. President Joe Biden signed a $1.5 trillion omnibus spending bill including, among other things, additional support for Ukraine.  Buried in the legislation were two interesting provisions. One would require companies to report crypto ransomware payments. This stems from last year’s prominent ransomware attacks, which impacted several critical services, including oil pipelines and meat processors.  Another provision apparently orders the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to brief Congress on cryptocurrencies and blockchain.  According to text of the bill:  (a) BRIEFING.—Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Director of National Intelligence shall provide to the congressional intelligence committees a briefing on the feasibility and benefits of providing training described in subsection (b).  As far as I can tell, this is the version of the bill signed by the president. So we should see this training happen sometime in June. I have no other details at this time – including who included this provision – but I’ll keep an eye on it.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  Securities and Exchange Commission Commissioner Allison Herren Lee will depart the securities regulator once her successor is confirmed. Her term expires this year but she can keep serving until the Senate votes to approve her replacement. The New York Times’ DealBook first reported the departure.  Sarah Bloom Raskin, one of U.S. President Joe Biden’s nominees to the Federal Reserve board, withdrew her name from consideration earlier today. The Senate Banking Committee’s GOP members had been blocking a vote to advance all of the Fed nominees due to Bloom Raskin’s role with Reserve Trust and/or her climate views, depending on whom you ask. Finally sinking her nomination, Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) - not a committee member - said he would not vote in her favor for the latter reason.

Bitcoin's price rose to over $39,000 early Tuesday and was up over 1% over the previous 24 hours. Ether was circling above $2,600 and was up about 2% over the same period. Most major cryptos were in the green. Bitcoin trading remained light as investors continued to process the volatile macroeconomic climate.  ""We expect that a lot of people are saying, 'maybe we should take a wait-and-see approach,"" Michael Safai, managing partner at quantitative trading firm Dexterity Capital, told CoinDesk TV's First Mover program.  Crypto prices dovetailed with major equities markets. The tech-focused Nasdaq was up 2.8%, while the S&P 500 rose more than 2%.  CoinDesk Senior Markets Reporter Omkar Godbole wrote that $1.2 billion in bitcoin had left the exchange Coinbase (COIN), which seemed to reflect institutional investors interest in the asset. ""While bitcoin's four-month bearish price action appears to have scared away retail leverage traders, institutions focused on longer-term horizons seem unperturbed,"" Godbole wrote.  Russia continued to pound the Ukraine capital Kyiv and other major cities, which faced humanitarian crises the likes of which have not been seen in Europe for decades. On Tuesday, the U.K. removed Russia from its most favored trade status. Most favored trade status, a principle established by the World Trade Organization, guarantees equal tariff and regulatory treatment among members of the group. Russia now faces a 35% increase above the usual tariffs on goods. On Monday, an employee of Russia's state TV ran onto a live newscast holding a poster protesting the war. Her whereabouts are currently unknown.  The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to increase interest rates by 25 basis points in its effort to reign in inflation that is likely to worsen with the continuation of the conflict in Ukraine. The price of Brent crude fell below $100 a barrel a week after rising to $130, but still remains higher than a year ago.  But Safai said that ""the Fed markets rate isn't something that crypto"" would respond to ""because they usually price it in at the beginning.""  ""We've known this rate was coming for a long time,"" he said. ""Crypto traders are smart."" He added: ""I don't think we're going to see a lot of changes in crypto markets.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,262 +2.1%  DJIA: 33,554 +1.8%  Nasdaq: 12,948 +2.8%  Gold: $1,917 -1.8%  Insights  China's stocks fall amid global tensions  The global economy is potentially on the precipice of disaster.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine, a European breadbasket, is likely to cause spikes in food prices due to interrupted harvests while a rise in COVID-19 cases has already led to lockdowns in China’s electronics manufacturing hub of Shenzhen, potentially disrupting production. High oil prices could cripple consumer spending.  In addition, U.S. regulators have continued to press American-listed Chinese firms for audits with the threat of delisting if they don’t comply. Chinese firms maintain the information sought are confidential state secrets and can’t be disclosed.  “Wall Street and Chinese-American funds are familiar with [Securities and Exchange Commission] rules, and they vigorously cooperate to sell short, and Chinese stocks naturally plummet,” Tony Ling, a Hangzhou-based partner at Bizantine Capital, told CoinDesk.  Ling pointed to JPMorgan’s downgrades of 28 Chinese stocks listed in the U.S. and Hong Kong, as well as the bank’s comments that Chinese tech stocks are “uninvestable” for six to 12 months as fuel for the industry-wide sell-off in those shares.  “The recent industry-wide sell-off is likely to continue in the absence of valuation support,” he said.  All this has hurt Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index, which is a hub for China-listed shares that are accessible to the outside world. Investors have priced in the threat of delisting and accelerating hostilities – and Hong Kong’s own out-of-control COVID-19 situation to top things off – giving the market its worst days since 2008.  Yet, bitcoin has marched on. It has been a fairly boring week for the world’s largest digital asset because it has been bouncing around plus or minus 2% all week. Yes, in some ways this is what it is designed to do by acting as a safe haven for capital. However, we’ve seen in recent months that bitcoin has begun to trade like a risk asset rather than an inflation hedge, making bitcoin’s absence in this market skirmish curious.  Is it because capital is headed back to the U.S. where it sees opportunity and is not necessarily fleeing? Or could it be a planned de-coupling? “The plummeting of Chinese concept stocks is no longer the normal operation of stocks but something that incites Western funds to decouple from Chinese concept stocks, causing chaos in the Chinese economy,” Bizantine’s Ling said.  More likely the only thing on crypto’s mind now is the Federal Reserve meeting and the announcement expected afterwards. Inflation and interest rates are on the top of the agenda, and crypto is certainly going to once again come up on the minutes.  It might be that the crypto market is still ""centralized"" around the Fed as the preeminent driver of macroeconomic policy, making it not much different than TradFi.  The minutes for the latest Fed Meeting are expected to be released soon. Unless U.S.-China equities spills over and Hong Kong’s market contagion spreads, which doesn’t look very likely, it will once again be the Fed that drives crypto prices.  Is that a case for further decentralization?     Technician's take  Bitcoin Approaching $40K Resistance Zone; Support at $37K  Bitcoin (BTC) is recovering after multiple setbacks from the $40,000 resistance zone. Technical indicators are mostly neutral and trading volume is low, suggesting a breakout or breakdown is likely this week.  So far, buyers have maintained a strong support base around $37,000, which could limit pullbacks over the short term. The significant loss of downside momentum on the weekly chart could also encourage buying activity, especially if a breakout above $40,000 occurs.  On the monthly chart, however, momentum signals are negative, which means upside could be limited toward the $46,700 resistance level.

Cosmos was established in order to overcome some of the problems that modern blockchains have. Scalability, governance, and usability are among these concerns. Blockchains can be separated into three conceptual layers from architecture: Application layer: It updates the state of blockchain based on the execution of transactions. Networking Layer: It is in charge of ensuring that transactions and consensus-related messages are propagated. Consensus Layer: It allows nodes to agree on the system&apos;s present state. The Cosmos is a decentralized network of autonomous, scalable, and interoperable blockchains powered by the Tendermint Core Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm. Cosmos is all about the multi-chain world, seamlessly communicating data and tokens between numerous sovereign blockchains.

The news broke on International Women’s Day, and Bain earned some online backlash for a photo of the all-male Bain Capital Crypto (BCC) team.  Those demographics changed on Tuesday with the announcement that Lydia Hylton is joining the team as a partner.  “I’ve gotten to know the BCC team over the last few months and have been blown away by their culture, intellectual rigor and investment judgment. We’ve pontificated at length about protocol defensibility, reflexivity and value accrual in the infrastructure stack. I’m excited to explore some of these topics working with an exceptional team,” Hylton wrote in an announcement post.  Hylton previously worked for Redpoint Ventures, a generalist venture capital firm that invests in seed, early and growth-stage projects. She shared a byline on the firm’s post announcing an investment in crypto infrastructure firm Alchemy in October.  At Bain, Hylton wrote that she will focus on decentralized finance (DeFi), consumer Web 3 and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO).  Bain Capital Ventures exec Stefan Cohen had posted the all-male team photo on March 8, sparking a backlash. He later deleted the tweet and apologized, writing that the firm was “committed to hiring women, investing in women-led projects and being a driving force in the industry for sponsoring the creativity and genius of women, non-binary people and people of color.”  Bain had followed Sequoia in launching a crypto-specific fund and was followed by a $250 million capital commitment from Bessemer Venture Partners toward crypto projects.  The trifecta of fund launches was widely seen as a signal that traditional finance firms are moving further into the nearly $2 trillion cryptocurrency sector.

Analysts expect the Fed to raise interest rates by 25 basis points, which could tighten financial conditions that have supported the rally in speculative assets over the past year. The Fed is also expected to announce a plan to reduce its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet.  Meanwhile, a fourth round of talks between Russian and Ukrainian diplomats continued on Monday, although there was no agreement on a ceasefire.  In crypto markets, bitcoin lagged alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) on Tuesday, which could reflect a greater appetite for risk among traders. BTC was up about 2% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 5% gain in ether (ETH) and a 20% rally in The Graph's GRT token.  Still, there is still a high degree of uncertainty in the market. ""Funding rates (the cost of holding long positions in the perpetual futures listed on major exchanges) on BTC perpetual futures contracts remain in limbo, unable to hold positive or negative for an extended period,"" Fundstrat Global Advisors wrote in a Tuesday email. ""This indicates that traders are unwilling to make significant bets one way or another.""

Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Room for a reprieve?  Some analysts expect selling pressure to wane across speculative assets, including equities and cryptos.  ""Key capital market indicators show that a significant slowdown in global growth is already discounted,"" MRB Partners, an investment strategy firm, wrote in a recent report. Once geopolitical tensions ease, global equities could have meaningful upside, according to MRB. That could be positive for crypto given the rising correlation between bitcoin and stocks.  Further, market participants have already positioned themselves for seven Fed rate hikes this year, in addition to the 25 basis point hike that is expected Wednesday, according to swaps data. Over time, barring any policy missteps or surprises, the market's reaction to rate hikes could be less volatile.  For crypto markets, extreme bearish sentiment could point to an eventual unwinding of short positions if prices move higher.  The charts below show peak-to-trough declines in bitcoin and global equities. Recent sell-offs have been severe, albeit above prior extremes (except Chinese internet stocks).  Charts below were created using Koyfin, a financial data platform.s  Crypto fund outflows  Digital asset investment products saw $110 million in outflows last week after reaching the highest inflows in three months the week before. That could reflect a cautious tone among crypto investors amid macroeconomic and geopolitical risks.  Dispersion across assets: $69.9 million exited bitcoin funds, $50.6 million exited ether funds and flows for other cryptos were modestly positive.  Still some appetite for crypto: Despite outflows in digital asset funds that directly invest in cryptocurrencies, investment products focusing on blockchain-related stocks remained very popular, according to a CoinShares report, with inflows of $4 million last week.

13220622,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=486040,1647374745,Will Ethereum Give In To Bears?,"In 2022, ethereum has been in a bearish trend. It has dropped 40% year to date, far more than the average cryptocurrency. ETH has a long history of being one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies. Since its introduction in 2016, it has largely outperformed Bitcoin, resulting in a narrowing of the market capitalization gap between the two coins. However, this year has deviated significantly from the long-term tendency. A key incentive to buy Ether has been removed from the market due to the waning of the NFT craze. ETH is now mostly used by traders, and demand for the cryptocurrency is far lower than it was late last year. Ethereum Price Swings The market has seen no apparent direction in the last 24 hours, as a consolidation between $2,500 support and $2,600 resistance continues. As a result, we can expect a follow-up push to either side after ETH/USD breaks to either side. As a result, the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain continues to undergo significant changes. Santiment, an on-chain data source, revealed that the Ethereum (ETH) price has dropped to an eight-month low, which is welcome news for ETH investors. According to Santiment: Ethereum is bouncing rapidly around the $2,560 level currently. In addition to the extremely tight #SP500 correlation it has right now (even more than Bitcoin), it&apos;s also seeing 8-month low fees right now. $ETH last had fees below $4.10 in mid-July.

The core Zebec payroll product allows workers to be paid by the second in USDC and other stablecoins.  The $21 million private sale investors included Circle, Coinbase, Solana Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Alameda Research. The $7 million public sale in partnership with Republic was priced at the same $0.021 price per token as the public sale.  “A public sale is not a capital-generating event,” Zebec founder Sam Thapaliya told CoinDesk in an interview, explaining the equal pricing. “Public sales should not be a way for private investors to have these unrealized gains. Rather, it should be more of a community-generating event. Crypto is all about being able to give access to the public, the same access that private investors are able to get.”  Read more: Zebec Protocol Launches on Solana Offering Flexible Payroll  The ZBC tokens were released instantly to buyers and available to trade on various exchanges.

Holders who stake ZBC will soon be able to list the tokens on a Solana-based Zebec debit card.  “[The token sale] allows us to give some form of governance to the community.

However, they are stable on the last trading week, capped below $550—an immediate resistance level. Past Performance The Illuvium price is stable on the last trading day but is down 78 percent from H2 2021 peaks. As per the formation in the daily chart, the ILV price is bearish, and every high may offer entries for aggressive traders. Even so, ILV has strong support at $470, flashing with 2022 lows. Illuvium Technical Analysis Illuvium sellers are in command at spot rates, reflecting the general state of the crypto market for the past few months. Despite the sharp sell-off, the stabilization of ILV prices is a net positive. Therefore, based on the formation in the daily chart, traders may wait for a close above $550—in a bull trend resumption—or a dump below $475 before placing trades. Thus far, there are higher highs relative to the lower BB, which signals bears&apos; strength and possibly exhaustion. Still, this depends on how prices edge past the immediate reaction point. A close below $470 would easily see ILV slide to $400, reversing all gains made in H2 2021. Conversely, a pullback above the resistance trend line and $550 may be the basis for a rally towards $600 and $740 in the medium term. What to Expect of Illuvium?

42420987,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXAqaL,1647369967,EU’s ‘Bitcoin Ban’ Fell Short but Experts Still Have Ideas for Fixing Crypto’s Carbon Costs,"Much ink has been spilled on cryptocurrency’s carbon footprint, as Monday’s deliberations in the European Parliament on proof-of-work (PoW) mining demonstrated. While the “EU bitcoin ban” did not come to pass, the energy discussion is not going away.  Experts in the field of renewable energy see two ways crypto can convincingly address its power consumption critics. Firstly, by creating demand for more renewable energy sources; secondly, by using blockchain technology itself to interact transparently with power grids in a measurable and auditable manner.  This two-pronged approach could make bitcoin revolutionary in a way that most people are only just waking up to, according to Doug Miller, co-founder of the recently launched Zero Labs.  “There are two roles for the cryptocurrency industry,” said Miller in an interview with CoinDesk. “One is being a buyer in clean energy markets. The other is providing new technologies for these markets. I think all bitcoin miners and those who hold bitcoin should pursue this, because relative to the value of bitcoin, it’s negligible. It’s a way to actually deliver on all of this promise that bitcoin claims to offer in terms of solving society’s problems.”  It’s well-known that bitcoin’s (BTC) PoW consensus mechanism burns through a lot of electricity, and looking beyond the largest cryptocurrency, there have recently been estimates at how many trees would have to be planted to offset the energy demands involved in minting and storing the growing collection of non-fungible tokens (NFT) on Ethereum, which is also a PoW chain (for now).  Speaking on CoinDesk TV this week, “Shark Tank” co-host Kevin O’Leary framed bitcoin’s environmental, social and governance (ESG) problem in terms of auditability.  “The biggest problem bitcoin miners have is when they say, ‘We’re 50% or 60% compliant with ESG mandates,’ they have to survive an audit,” O’Leary told “First Mover” host Christine Lee. “There’s not a single audit firm that will sign that because they know the tracking error on carbon credits is so large it’s unauditable.”  Getting RECs  The focus here isn’t on carbon offsetting via tree planting and the like (although that can also benefit from blockchain-based tracking), but rather the well-established market for companies and organizations that want to buy clean power because they feel policy makers are not moving fast enough towards greener grids.  This process involves what are often referred to as renewable energy certificates (REC), an instrument for confirming a company has opted to buy clean power from solar, wind or hydro facilities. The power grid tracks how much energy comes from renewable facilities, which earn additional revenue from those certificates on top of the electricity sale.  This private-sector voluntary market has created demand for tons of new capacity, especially in solar and wind over the past decade or so. This has also had the side effect of creating greater political capital for clean energy regulation and policy, said Miller, pointing to a “huge opportunity” to create new demand for clean electricity through the crypto sector.  “If crypto miners, exchanges, networks and investors purchase clean energy based on their measured or estimated energy use and then cancel those certificates in their names to make a public clean energy claim, that would create significant demand in clean energy markets,” Miller said. “It would also be a way for the industry to show leadership.”  Read more: Filecoin Might Have a Way for Bitcoin to Fight Its Energy Critics (if Miners Use It)  As well as driving a lot of demand for clean energy, crypto’s blockchain technology, which was designed to share a catalog of transactions so coins can’t be spent twice, can digitize and streamline clean energy markets. This involves assigning digital identities to clean energy facilities, for example, and creating digital representations of the certificates that are received, sold and ultimately canceled.  “The way clean energy markets currently work is kind of old-fashioned,” said Miller. “There are a lot of manual processes and cross-referencing to make sure a particular company bought or sold or canceled a certain renewable energy certificate. With blockchain technology, we can have really granular transparency around the full lifecycle of every single certificate.”  The Filecoin effect  There are now a number of nascent efforts working hard to change the way “normies” think about crypto’s energy consumption. Last year, Energy Web, a blockchain-based system aimed at decarbonizing power grids, launched the Crypto Climate Accord, a group of 200 or so crypto firms, non-governmental organizations (NGO) and technology providers, inspired by the Paris Climate Agreement.  Also blazing a trail in this area is decentralized file storage blockchain Filecoin, which last year launched the Filecoin Green initiative with a dashboard for the system’s storage providers (the equivalent of miners) to easily handle and verify their use of RECs.  Filecoin has more in common with Bitcoin than you might think, because the former’s energy use is also non-negotiable, in the same way that centralized data centers must consume energy to stay online. “There’s no proof-of-stake version in which the energy to store files goes to zero,” said Filecoin Green creator Ransil in a previous interview with CoinDesk, alluding to the staking consensus mechanism used to secure newer blockchain networks.  As well as doing things like providing a $38 million grant last month to build more solar power facilities, Filecoin incentivizes storage providers to choose greener energy via a reputation system that earns more storage contacts.  “There’s an economic incentive to be green, as it’s one of the parameters of the [Filecoin] reputation system,” said Beltran Berrocal, a co-founder of Zero Labs, a sister project to Filecoin Green. “It’s our belief that Web 3 can make it easier for people to take climate action in the market for RECs. Today, this is reserved only for legacy corporations.”  ‘Dcent’ behavior  Incentives to be greener are definitely working on Filecoin storage providers such as Dcent, which built a data center just north of Amsterdam in the Netherlands dedicated to Filecoin, now one of the largest European storage entities on its network.  Hidde Hoogland, a computer hardware specialist at Dcent B.V., said that as well as purchasing wind and solar power, his data center is adding its own solar panels because it owns the roof rights – all of which can be publicly recorded via the public Filecoin dashboard.  “On Filecoin, making yourself more sustainable and more green makes you a better market player to sell this storage,” said Hoogland in an interview. “We will soon have a 100% full transparency on-chain regarding the amount of energy we create, the amount we use and how efficient we are. So if there’s any client looking for a place to store data in a decentralized way, they can just see, ‘Oh, these guys are really sustainable.’”  This is great for lovers of Web 3, but what about the biggest and baddest blockchain?  Asked if Bitcoin miners could emulate Filecoin’s push towards publicly provable renewable energy use, Hoogland said: “They could. But do they want to?”  This is the first piece in a two-part series.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIL | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/15/eus-bitcoin-ban-fell-short-but-experts-still-have-ideas-for-fixing-cryptos-carbon-costs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1c1805431751c86213f58565e348219c5742f77-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Thorchain, which is built on the Cosmos blockchain, is a decentralized liquidity protocol that specializes in cross-chain connectivity, allowing traders to swap tokens between different networks.  The RUNE protocol went live with synthetic assets trading on the platform last Thursday. The launch of synthetic assets allows users to swap assets at relatively low costs and high speeds.  “Synths are great for traders and arbs since they can be transacted at a higher speed and lower costs than normal swaps,” said Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at FundStrat.  Farrell said another possible catalyst is the recent announcement that ThorFi will be coming to the Thorchain ecosystem, which will be bring lending and borrowing features to the platform.  “We are clearly moving towards a multichain world and having a cross-chain DEX (decentralized exchange) that doesn’t rely on wrapped assets or inefficient atomic swaps is a giant value add to the space,” Farrell added.

42411475,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glONig,1647365465,LimeWire and the Zombie Brands Pivot to Crypto,"Last week, the defunct music platform LimeWire announced a comeback under new management.  Yes, LimeWire is back – but as a marketplace for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) rather than a file-sharing service, and with a team that has nothing to do with the early-aughts classic you knew and (maybe) loved.  It’s the latest example of a brand returning from the dead to cash in on the crypto gold rush. RadioShack, MoviePass and even something called “BlockbusterDAO” have all leaned into near-past nostalgia, too.  LimeWire’s resurrection is a bet on the power of the brand. The team behind the company’s new, crypto-inflected service is hoping a trusted name can help ease new users into the notoriously inhospitable world of Web 3.  This article is excerpted in The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  LimeWire rose to prominence in the early 2000s, post-Napster and pre-streaming, as a piracy-centric music alternative to the iTunes Store. Just as you could get free movies and software through BitTorrent, LimeWire allowed you to download audio files (usually at an incredibly slow pace). In 2010, the service was shut down by a federal injunction, and the company behind it paid $105 million to major record labels in an out-of-court settlement.  It’s remembered fondly, though. The rapper Soulja Boy – one of the first real internet-native musicians – famously used the platform to drum up interest in his first few singles. For those frustrated with the current structure of the music business, with its emphasis on algorithmic discovery and streaming monoliths, it’s not hard to find something appealing in the DIY clunkiness of the LimeWire paradigm.  Not your cousin’s LimeWire  LimeWire was acquired last year by a pair of Austrian brothers, Paul and Julian Zehetmayr, and is now being relaunched with a crypto twist. Purchases will be denominated in U.S. dollars, but it’s pitching itself as an OpenSea alternative, a kind of eBay for NFTs, with a focus on music-related collectibles. Julian told Bloomberg it will be “initially a very music-focused marketplace,” but left the door open for other kinds of NFTs down the line.  On Monday, LimeWire announced a partnership with the company behind the Algorand blockchain. In an attempt to get speculators on board, the company also plans to release a token (according to the company’s website, LMWR is already being sold to insiders on an invite-only basis).  What’s not clear is how the new LimeWire will distinguish itself from existing music NFT platforms. Sound.xyz, which launched in December, is explicitly focused on communal listening and monetization. Royal, led by the producer Justin Blau, offers song royalties via crypto. Catalog is a marketplace for one-of-one audio NFTs. And communities like Water & Music, Tiny Mix Tapes, Poolsuite and Sone are experimenting with the social side of music NFTs.  So far, LimeWire’s revival feels like pure gesturing, an attempt by these two entrepreneurs to piggyback on the file-sharing site’s reputation in the hopes of a quick payday.  And while cash grabs have always been par for the course in crypto, the attempt to resurrect an old, beloved brand under the auspices of Web 3 has become something of a trend in recent months.  Web 3’s a trend  RadioShack, the chain of electronics stores, filed for bankruptcy in 2015, but was resurrected in December as a decentralized exchange for cryptocurrencies. The self-help influencer Tai Lopez purchased the brand in 2020 and orchestrated the relaunch.  The proposition is that an older, more established brand is better positioned to hold the hands of mainstream consumers still getting a feel for these complicated new systems.  “Currently crypto has no well-known brands over even 15 years old,” announces one promotional document for the RadioShack relaunch. “Until now. It is our hypothesis that the best way for crypto to be more mainstream is for an established brand name in the tech space to lead the way.”  As it exists today, radioshack.org hosts what’s essentially an off-brand version of Uniswap, the leading decentralized exchange for Ethereum-based tokens. Within what appears to be a skeuomorphic radio interface, you can swap between ETH, USDC, USDT, MATIC and a few other coins.  Of course, you can also swap for RADIO, the cryptocurrency Lopez and his team have whipped up to promote this product (it’s currently trading at about 2 cents a pop).  As with LimeWire, there’s no clear reason for this zombie product to exist, except to lull potential customers into a false sense of security. But nostalgia won’t help you, in crypto. It’s difficult to imagine your average hardware junkie – i.e., the kind of person who might have wanted to shop at RadioShack in the ‘90s – feeling enticed by a program that lets you exchange one kind of obscure cryptocurrency for another. At least with LimeWire, the customer base already skews toward file sharers and privacy nerds.  Another one  There’s also MoviePass, a subscription-based ticketing service for movie theaters, which got big in 2018 on the back of its incredible sticker price: $10 a month for virtually unlimited screening at a variety of theaters. (One film per day, really, but who’s counting?) Being impossible to maintain, this price was also why the company folded in late 2019.  MoviePass hasn’t been scrapped and sold for parts in quite the same way as RadioShack and LimeWire, but it’s almost certainly planning to incorporate “the blockchain” into whatever it’s got planned for its resurrection.  During a press event last month, original MoviePass co-founder Stacy Spikes revealed, somewhat hilariously, that MoviePass 2.0 will involve eyeball-tracking software.  Spikes’s idea is that consumers want to spend more time watching advertisements than they do watching movies.  “I love product placement in movies,” Spikes said, per the New York Post. “I love the cars, I love the watches, I love the clothes. I’m that person that sometimes has a notepad and I’m writing down, is that Hugo Boss?”  Chilling stuff.  As outlined by Spikes, MoviePass 2.0 will track your eyeballs using facial detection. If the software determines you’re really watching the ads, you’ll get credits; watching in-demand movies during primetime on the new service will require more of these credits. It’s all “powered by Web 3 technology,” which is to say, a blockchain with a crypto coin.  It’s somewhat in line with Y Combinator founder Sam Altman’s Worldcoin project, which, amazingly, also gleans blockchain-backed tokens from consumers’ eyeballs. My colleague, David Z. Morris, called it “creepy as hell.”  Why?  What is it about the blockchain that makes it such an appealing last resort? Can Web 3 really breathe new life into these once-beloved services, or is the idea of a blockchain pivot a kind of giving up in and of itself? Is the “ownership economy” narrative really that compelling?  Consumers can tell when something’s not quite right. I’m not convinced by the argument that consumers will instinctively trust something like a LimeWire 2.0 just because they recognize the name.  Every brand dies, baby, that's a fact. Maybe it’s better to accept that reality than to go the “Weekend at Bernie’s” route.  LimeWire, RadioShack and MoviePass are three extremely different companies, offering extremely different products, even now. The blockchain has never been a one-size-fits-all solution; no good can come from recklessly jumping on the hype train.",NEUTRAL,없음,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/03/15/limewire-and-the-zombie-brands-pivot-to-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0e5e0b77bd7f16160506b635becf4ba7073f72a8-1982x1513.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, as technology progressed, the original vision was largely abandoned, leading to an overly centralized online ecosystem. Web 2.0, the version of the internet that we are currently living and most familiar with, has several drawbacks that we rarely discuss. Most of these problems stem from the fact that most Web 2.0 relies on digital identifiers. But what are these &apos;digital identifiers,&apos; and why do they matter? In the simplest terms, digital identifiers are used by third-party service providers to validate a user&apos;s identity. These are primarily managed by big tech companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, network operators, email service providers, and other online platforms that allow users to access the world wide web. A common example of digital identifiers is the OAuth2 option, which almost everyone uses. You are asked to register whenever you wish to access a new platform, such as an eCommerce store or a social media app. To make registration easy for users, many platforms employ OAuth2 - the feature that allows users to register through their existing Google or social media accounts directly.

The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) with Multicoin Capital, 3 Arrows Capital, Tiger Global, FTX Ventures, Coinbase Ventures and more also signing checks.  Aptos is among a handful of teams looking to bring the Diem (formerly Libra) blockchain to life outside of the watchful eye of Meta (formerly Facebook). 0L is another project similarly looking to revive Diem, in part through its Carpe app.  In a second Aptos blog post on Tuesday, the team sketched out some of its blockchain’s tech specs.  Notably, Aptos said its devnet, meant for coders to contribute open-source code, is now live – with developers at big-name crypto firms offering their time.  “There are great companies like Anchorage, Binance, Blockorus, Coinbase [COIN], Livepeer, Moonclave, Paxos, Paymagic, Rarible and Streaming Fast in our community already giving feedback, and contributing code on Devnet,” Aptos wrote.  “We have worked with the Aptos founders over the last few years to bring to life the decentralized vision we both share,” Joe Lallouz, head of product at Coinbase Cloud told CoinDesk in an email. “We are incredibly excited to support them and their team with solutions and infrastructure to bring more participants and builders to the ecosystem.” (Coinbase was a member of the Diem Association from its launch in mid-2019.)  In its blog post, Aptos ID’d “next-gen social media platforms, rich [non-fungible token] experiences, Web 3 games, creator-first media and entertainment businesses, cheap and secure payments, [decentralized finance]-integrated fintech products, and so much more,” as potential applications to live on Aptos.

42375105,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw5eY3,1647355240,$450M Raise Values Ethereum Builder ConsenSys at $7B as MetaMask Tops 30M Users,"Ethereum application and infrastructure builder ConsenSys has closed a $450 million funding round that values the New York City-based blockchain company at $7 billion.  The hefty Series D round, led by ParaFi Capital, more than doubles ConsenSys’ valuation based on its previous $200 million fundraise in November 2021. Existing investors, including Third Point and Marshall Wace, were joined by a new clutch of backers that included Singapore’s Temasek, SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Microsoft. (There were also a slew of celebrity investors involved, including rappers 21 Savage and Young Thug.)  The firm’s new valuation coincides with its flagship Ethereum wallet and browser extension, MetaMask, reaching over 30 million monthly active users, while Infura, a widely used infrastructure tool created by ConsenSys, now boasts some 430,000 developers, according to a press release on Tuesday.  Read more: ConsenSys Plots Massive Expansion Following $200M Fundraising  Physical expansion plans for ConsenSys, voiced around the time of the last funding round, will see the firm’s headcount increase from 700 to over 1,000 employees by the end of 2022. (The firm had about 1,200 employees in 2018 before a series of contractions.) The funding will also support the expansion of MetaMask with a major redesign scheduled for release later this year.  Stepping back, a valuation of this size is not uncommon for established crypto companies, which have bagged billions in recent months. Competing infrastructure provider Alchemy was valued at over $10 billion in a $200 million funding round just last month.  However, ConsenSys seems to be plowing its own furrow with the firm’s stated intention to convert much of its treasury into Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), some of which will be sunk into decentralized finance (DeFi) yield and governance operations, ConsenSys said. The lion’s share will be staked in anticipation of Ethereum’s upcoming merge to proof-of-stake.  “We view ourselves as powering what’s going on, rather than trying to compete with what’s going on,” ConsenSys Chief Strategy Officer Simon Morris told CoinDesk in an interview. “We are really in pursuit of an agenda around decentralization, and how do we take the core pieces that we’ve got and then start to progressively decentralize them, so that they’re not just in our hands; they’re actually in a combination of our hands and our partners and our end users.”  For example, an airdrop of MetaMask governance tokens has long been rumored.  Growing pains  An agenda that’s all about injecting positive momentum into the entire crypto ecosystem, and the novel idea that the balance sheet of a firm like ConsenSys is a “sort of lens into the future of companies,” as Morris puts it, is great.  But it’s not all kumbaya around the ConsenSys campfire. The high valuation and rapid growth will likely infuriate those former ConsenSys employees and shareholders who believe they are due a slice of the company’s recent good fortune.  A specific point of contention, which is driving the latest legal challenge, concerns the transfer of assets – including MetaMask and Infura – from the original Switzerland-based company ConsenSys AG to a U.S.-based company, ConsenSys Software Inc. (CSI), which was spun out in early 2020 around the time the COVID-19 pandemic was hitting.  Read more: ConsenSys AG Shareholders File for Independent Audit of MetaMask, Infura Transaction  The value of assets transferred to CSI was determined and vetted by external experts and relevant local authorities, according to documents circulated to ConsenSys shareholders and former staffers last year. JPMorgan also stepped in and took a 10% share in CSI, and contributed its enterprise Ethereum client, Quorum, to the new software company.  Morris said the threatened legal action in Switzerland relates to a specific point in time when crypto was still toughing it out of a dark and prolonged winter, and the price of ETH had dipped to three-digit woes.  “People want to pretend that we knew what was happening with MetaMask before things like the DeFi space and NFTs took off,” Morris said. “We were hopeful of course. But before we had any revenue, we honestly had no idea that we’d be this successful. So I think people are being a little opportunistic. The law is the law, and they are welcome to take a swing at that.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/15/450m-raise-values-ethereum-builder-consensys-at-7b-as-metamask-tops-30m-users,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/039f883a809dde534be4a326579176c4601f0691-4000x2668.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Follow CoinDesk Brasil on Twitter.  Brazil-based crypto asset manager Hashdex plans to launch a Web 3 exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Brazilian stock exchange B3 on March 30.  The company announced that initial orders for the ETF, which will trade under the ticker WEB311, began on Monday and will last until March 25. Hashdex estimates the starting share price will be $9.72.  The fund, developed in partnership with global crypto index provider CF Benchmarks, will mirror the CF Web 3.0 Smart Contract Platforms Market Cap Index, which contains digital assets native to smart contract blockchains Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), Algorand (ALGO), Tezos (XTZ) and Cosmos (ATOM). It will not invest in equities.  According to Hashdex, WEB311 is the “world’s first ETF that invests solely of digital assets native to smart contract blockchain networks.”  In January, Simplify Asset Management filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a Web 3 ETF that would trade under the ticker symbol WIII and track Web 3 companies.  Banco Genial, Itaú BBA, XP Investimentos and BTG Pactual will coordinate the offering of WEB311, with a total management fee of 1.3%, Hashdex said.  “The WEB311 ETF not only provides exposure to the smart contract platforms underpinning Web 3, but serves as an accessible and unique way to invest in projects that will be the main engine of the internet of the future,” said Hashdex co-founder and CEO, Marcelo Sampaio.  In February, Hashdex listed a DeFi ETF on B3 that raised $10.5 million at launch.  This article was translated by Andrés Engler, and edited by CoinDesk.

42394543,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwBXS9,1647352496,What Is a Rebase/Elastic Token?,"A rebase, or elastic, token is a cryptocurrency whose supply is algorithmically adjusted in order to control its price. Similar to stablecoins, rebase tokens are usually pegged to another asset. But instead of using reserves to maintain the peg, rebase tokens automatically burn tokens in circulation or mint new tokens.  The supply of a rebase token can be highly volatile, but its price tends to remain steady depending on which asset's price it’s tracking.  The code behind every cryptocurrency specifies rules for the coin’s supply, meaning all the ways coins can be created (minted) or destroyed (burned). But it is uncommon to design those rules with a specific price in mind.  For example, new bitcoin is created when miners successfully validate recent transactions. There is no other way to create bitcoin and there is no way to destroy the coins. Bitcoin is created in this way to incentivize mining and control the issuance of new tokens entering circulation, not to control the bitcoin price. Therefore, bitcoin isn't a rebase token.  Ampleforth (AMPL) is an example of a rebase token. Every 24 hours, the supply of the token is adjusted with the aim of keeping its price close to $1.  If AMPL’s price rises by more than a few cents, then every wallet that holds AMPL is given extra tokens in proportion to its existing holdings. That means everyone still owns the same percentage of all the AMPL in existence. With more tokens going around, fundamental economic forces will tend to drive its price back down toward the target. On the other hand, when the price falls below a certain threshold, the opposite happens as tokens are proportionately removed from holders' wallets.  The point is that each AMPL token you own will still be worth roughly $1, while the total value of all the AMPL tokens you own can still fluctuate wildly. Other tokens like RMPL and based money (BASED) have aimed to improve on AMPL protocol while preserving its core appeal.  A token from the Shiba Inu ecosystem named dogekiller (LEASH) was originally released as a rebase token that tracked the price of dogecoin (DOGE) at a ratio of 1/1000th – meaning if the price of dogecoin was $0.50, Doge Killer's token price would be $500. This meant that Shiba Inu investors could benefit from the price movements of dogecoin without having to directly invest in the token; drawing more users to the ecosystem.  Eventually, however, LEASH tokens were “unleashed” and now no longer track dogecoin’s price. Instead, it now operates as a store-of-value coin whose price is dictated by supply and demand like a vast majority of other cryptocurrencies.",NEUTRAL,DOGE,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | DOGE | SHIB | TRADING,Benedict George,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-rebaseelastic-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8088abb216eaf2b06382e4d33d946c4e0546d05b-1998x1500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Efinity’s ecosystem is set to be home to over 100 blockchain-based games and applications, the first of which is CryptoBlades, a play-to-earn NFT game with over 1 million users (it’s currently on five smart-contract blockchains with Efinity set to become its sixth).  Enjin bolstered plans to build out its Efinity metaverse to the tune of $100 million back in November. The platform’s first major funding came last July, when it raised $19 million in a private token sale led by Crypto.com Capital, DFG Group and Hashed, followed by a $20 million public token sale through CoinList in July.  “NFTs and their applications have come such a long way in the past year,” Enjin Chief Technology Officer Witek Radomski told CoinDesk in an interview. “The infrastructure to support them at scale needs to be built, with projects like this one really moving the space forward for so many users.”  Read more: Enjin Forms $100M Fund to Support Metaverse Projects  Polkadot parachains allow for individual projects to create their own dedicated blockchains at scale, a workaround to NFT-based platforms that often congest their network with high volumes of transactions.

Avalanche recently announced a $290 million fund to promote NFT and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on its “subnets,” the first of which being the popular GameFi platform DeFi Kingdoms.  Along with the announcement of Efinity, Enjin says it has plans to roll out beta versions of its NFT.io marketplace and wallet by the end of March.

42375108,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw5efb,1647348397,"First Mover Americas: Bitcoin's Implied Volatility Ticks Higher, S&P 500 Sees Death Cross","Good morning, and welcome to First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin's implied volatility ticks higher ahead of the Fed rate decision  Chartist's Corner: Death cross on S&P 500.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time. Today’s show will feature guests:  Michael Safai, managing partner, Dexterity Capital  Robbie Ferguson, co-founder and president, Immutable  Bohdan Opryshko, COO, Everstake  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin's implied volatility is creeping higher ahead of the Federal Reserve's rate decision, which is perhaps a sign that traders are setting up options positions that would benefit from price swings in the leading cryptocurrency.  The annualized one-month implied volatility, investors' expectations for price turbulence over the next four weeks, has increased from 68% to 77% this month, according to data provided by Skew. The three- and six-month gauges have gone up from roughly 67% to 74%.  More importantly, the three-month implied volatility has popped back above the backward-looking realized volatility, having underperformed the same earlier this month.  An uptick in implied volatility indicates increased demand for options, which are hedging instruments. A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A put option represents the right to sell.  Seasoned traders use options to hedge bullish or bearish risks and often buy both to capture returns from any macro data release or binary event-related volatility. Buying both call and put options represents a bullish view on volatility.  Several orders for straddles and strangles have crossed the tape in recent days, according to over-the-counter tech platform Paradigm's Telegram-based tracker of crypto options flows. Straddle and strangle strategies involve buying both call and put options and allow investors to profit from big moves in the underlying asset.  The Fed is likely to raise rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday. And while the markets may have priced in the increase, potential hawkish guidance could inject volatility into the market, bringing gains to volatility buyers.  While implied volatility gauges have risen in the run-up to the Fed's announcement, overall they are well below the highs seen in October and November.  Besides, the way options are priced suggests buying has been primarily concentrated in longer duration call options of late. Perhaps, these traders are hedging against the risk of a large move to the higher side over a three-month to one-year time horizon.

The Shanghai police bureau had conducted an investigation for over six months across different provinces to track down the criminal ring, according to a post on the bureau's official WeChat account.  The suspected criminals set up an online platform in June 2020 that attracted users through membership rewards and the promise of static income, the police said.  Users were asked to exchange their fiat currency for platform tokens to gain membership, but the tokens had no market value and their price was actually controlled by the platform. This combined with the numerous membership rewards and levels encouraged users to keep referring new accounts, the police said.  During the platform's life, 60,000 member accounts were created across 72 levels of hierarchical relationships and membership status, and the scheme involved more than RMB 100 million, the post said.

UBXS token can be used to buy assets within the virtual reality worlds developed on the BSC network.

The attack on Deus Finance occurred on its Fantom network iteration. Deus Finance allows developers to build and issue financial instruments, such as derivatives or options, on its platform.  PeckShield said attackers manipulated prices on Deus’s offerings using a flash loan, a form of uncollateralized lending using smart contracts.  Hackers used flash loans to manipulate the contract that determined the price of DEI – one of the two tokens issued by Deus Finance – to falsely show that DEI had collapsed. This led to a loss of all funds of the users supplying liquidity to the DEI/USDC pool.  Blockchain data shows that over 3 million USDC tokens were stolen from Deus which was exchanged for 200,000 DAI and 1,101.8 ether (ETH) via decentralized exchange Multichain. The funds were then withdrawn to the privacy swap tool Tornado, which masks the addresses of the hacker and makes it difficult to tie stolen funds to their perpetrator.  Deus closed contracts affected by the attack and said its developers were working on a post-mortem report. Prices of Deus’s native DEUS token fell nearly 40% following reports of the hack but seemed to recover at the time of writing.

The fact is that buyers managed to win a local victory and swallow the previous weekly candle of sellers. All this happened at an increased volume, which signals the growing interest of investors in the DASH cryptocurrency. Of course, looking at the weekly timeframe, it is too early to talk about the absolute dominance of buyers, but the first stone for success is laid. The $90 range was the starting point. https://www.tradingview.com/x/xBSSxIID/ At the moment, there is only one question - whether the DASH price reversal will start from this range, or whether sellers will be able to organize a financial fall wave to $70. To implement a positive scenario and reverse the price without updating the mark of $90, buyers need to test the mark of $120 during the trading week on 14 March. This action of buyers organizes a consolidation corridor in the range of $90-$120, in which buyers will have a chance to gain a position to start growing with the first target of $140. This increase in the DASH price will not mean a change in the global trend. The $140 mark is the global trend line of sellers, which they have been keeping since May 2021.

Since then, buyers have never organized at least some rebound in the ADA price on a weekly timeframe. The price falls without much trading, which proves the complete uselessness of this cryptocurrency to investors. In 7 months, the ADA price fell by 75%. The main question is whether there is still potential for sellers to continue to fall? In the weekly timeframe, we see that the nearest liquidity zone, where the ADA price significantly slowed down, is around $0.17. All other price space of the ADA cryptocurrency grew uncorrected. https://www.tradingview.com/x/jmAc7BzQ/ Do we expect such a sharp fall of the ADA price and the $0.17 test? So far, this is not a very real scenario that will completely bury this cryptocurrency for a long time. The first local point where buyers will be able to organize a price rebound is $0.7. Starting from the trading week on 21 February, we see that the ADA price fall has slowed. The sellers no longer have enough strength to continue to put pressure on the price, and their latest achievement maybe the $0.7 test. Of course, this does not mean that after the price rebound from $0.7, the global downward trend will not continue. However, in the local perspective, the ADA price rebound with a global target of $1.4 is highly likely.

That's evident from the recent large outflow of coins from the U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), according to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode.  A total of 31,130 bitcoin left Coinbase last week, the highest single-week outflow since 2017, data tracked by Glassnode shows.  ""Large outflows like this one are actually part of a consistent trend in the Coinbase balance, which has been stair-stepping downwards over the last two years,"" Glassnode said in a weekly newsletter published Monday. ""As the largest exchange by BTC balance, and a preferred venue for U.S. based institutions, this further supports the adoption of bitcoin as a macro asset by larger institutions.""  The past week's outflow has pushed the number of coins held on the Nasdaq-listed exchange to a four-year low of 649,500 BTC. The balance held across all centralized exchanges has dropped to 2,519,403 BTC, the lowest number since November 2018.  The declining exchange balance means fewer coins are available for liquidations on the exchange. In other words, the sell-side liquidity is drying up, suggesting scope for a sharp move on the higher side, especially as the coins withdrawn from Coinbase were moved to a largely inactive wallet.  ""If we look at the Illiquid Supply Shock Ratio (ISSR), we can see a significant uptick this week, suggesting that these withdrawn coins have been moved into a wallet with little-to-no history of spending,"" Glassnode said.

Past Performance of ROSE ROSE coin price cracks into the $0.20 support level as the selling pressure increases in the overall market. As a result, the coin price has decreased by 25% in the last two weeks resulting in multiple bearish candles. The altcoin maintains the overall downtrend and aims to reach the next support level after facing rejection from the 200-day EMA. Source-Tradingview ROSE Technical Analysis ROSE coin price might reach the $0.16 mark shortly as the downtrend gains momentum after the support level breakout. However, closing below the $0.20 mark is necessary for the upcoming bearish trend. The 50-day and 200-day EMA are on the verge of giving a death cross with the falling trend of the 100-day EMA. Hence, the upcoming death cross will result in a rise in selling pressure. RSI Indicator: The RSI slope shows the sideways trend developing into a downfall that may shortly enter the oversold zone. Hence, crossing below the 30% mark will mark a selling point. MACD Indicator: The MACD and signal lines are on the cusp of giving a bearish crossover as the lines show saturation.

Will the bears demolish another psychological support? Key technical points: The coin price approaches the $1 mark. The RSI approaches the oversold zone. The 24-hour trading volume of GALA is $886 Million, marking a 26% rise. Past Performance of GALA GALA coin price rests above the $0.20 support zone with the constant overhead bearish influence by the resistance trendline. As a result, the coin price consolidates for a week with no significant fluctuations representing minimum trading activities. However, this sideways movement is a blessing in disguise for GALA holders as other Meta tokens like MANA and SAND have declined by 20% and 15% last fortnight.

However, a rise in trading volume is a must for the bullish breakout of the resistance trendline. The 50-day and 100-day EMA give a bearish crossover but struggles for a bearish spread. Therefore, the bulls can still sabotage the crossover with a reversal and bring another bullish crossover.

""CoinJoin"" is a type of send transaction that can be used on the Bitcoin protocol to protect users' privacy. The peer-to-peer, decentralized protocol disguises the origin of bitcoin transactions (inputs) by combining them with many other inputs in a pool and then returning an equivalent amount of funds to the users, obfuscating the details of the bitcoin's origin.  ""They can be used to provide a 'layering' service, churning criminal cash obscuring its origins and audit trail, similar to how a cash business might be used by criminals to legitimize cash through the banking system,"" Gary Cathcart, the NCA's head of financial investigation, said in an interview with FT published on Tuesday.  The NCA wishes for regulation that would require mixers to comply with money laundering laws, carrying out customer checks and audit trails of funds swapping hands on their platforms.  CoinJoin usage hit a peak of 65,000 BTC ($2.5 billion) in January 2021, equivalent to 0.35% of the total bitcoin transacted that month.  Some crypto exchanges have responded to crypto mixing by barring transactions from their services that appear to have participated in CoinJoins. Yesterday, zkSNACKs, the company behind the privacy focussed Wasabi wallet, announced it will bar certain bitcoin (BTC) transactions from using its CoinJoin coordination service.

The top cryptocurrency by market value traded 3% lower on the day at $38,300 during the European session, having almost tested the $40,000 mark late Monday, CoinDesk data shows.  The futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index traded 0.5% lower, signaling a continued risk aversion. On Monday, the index fell 2%, leading the S&P 500 and Dow Jones lower as investors rotated money into value stocks from growth stocks ahead of an impending Fed rate hike on Wednesday.  As of Monday, overnight index swaps saw the Fed funds rate, or the benchmark interest rate, at 1.85% after the December meeting. An overnight index swap is an agreement where a fixed rate is swapped against a pre-determined published index of a daily overnight reference rate.  In other words, with the current effective Fed funds rate at 0.08%, traders expected 175 basis points worth of tightening for 2022. That's equivalent to seven quarterly percentage point (25 basis point) rate hikes. Markets had priced in two of the seven rate hikes, leaving five on the table following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.  The renewed hawkish repricing aligns with investment banking giant Goldman Sachs' forecast. It suggests bleak near-term prospects for risk assets, including bitcoin, more so as traders see interest rate peaking around 2.57% in the second half of 2023 – up 50 basis points in one week and 100 basis points this year, according to Reuters.  Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said the Fed is likely to raise the forecast for the so-called terminal or peak interest rate to 3% from December's projection of 2.5%.  The Fed is widely expected to kick off the tightening cycle on Wednesday with a 25 basis point rate hike.

42375130,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw5iyJ,1647329360,Bitcoin Unaffected by Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Meltdown,"Hong Kong’s stock market had its worst day since 2008 this week, with the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI), an index of mainland China companies listed in Hong Kong, closing down 7% Monday and dropping another 4% by mid-day Tuesday.  Overall, the HSCEI is down 16% in the last five days while the overall Hang Seng is down 11%.  Bloomberg reported that the Hang Seng Volatility Index, which is used to measure volatility in the Hong Kong stock market, has topped 40. This is the first time the index has gone over 40 since March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic began and global markets imploded.  The price of bitcoin (BTC) seems to be fairly unaffected by the market volatility and is nearly flat over the last week. At the time of writing, bitcoin was trading at $38,804, up 0.5% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.  Flora Li, Huobi Research Institute director, told CoinDesk this market volatility was largely driven by regulatory developments in China and the U.S., and is unrelated to broader macroeconomic factors which is why it has not impacted the crypto market.  “Last Friday the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] disclosed a list of delisting risks that included five U.S.-listed Chinese companies, sparking investor concerns about the delisting of Chinese stocks, so Chinese and U.S. investors have been selling off,” she told CoinDesk via email. Investors in Hong Kong have also been selling because of connections between the territory’s market and that in China, she added.  Even though Hong Kong’s market decline is regulatory and not macro-driven, some investors are looking down the near-term time horizon and urging caution. Andrew Bakst, chief investment officer of Bizantine Capital, told CoinDesk he sees a fragile global economy that needs to break first before it can come back stronger.  “All-time high intra-country wealth gaps, along with all-time high sovereign debt levels, and all-time highs of inter-country connectivity have created an extremely fragile global economy,” he said. “All three factors are inflationary and hurt sovereign equities.”  Despite the lack of correlation between Hong Kong’s market volatility and crypto, if there’s a contagion that brings down the global market, Bakst is bullish that Ethereum might be the tie that binds the world as it rebuilds.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/15/bitcoin-unaffected-by-hong-kongs-hang-seng-meltdown,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b8c68cab966676b9f15cbad2ba77626343168a46-799x533.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Will the bears demolish another psychological support? Key technical points: FTM price approaches the $1 mark. The RSI approaches the oversold zone. The 24-hour trading volume of Fantom is $886 Million, marking a 26% rise. Past Performance of FTM As we forecasted in our previous article, the FTM coin price shows the wedge pattern breakout rally reaching the $1 mark. Furthermore, the downfall intensified to touch the 25% mark last week, resulting in multiple bearish candles with higher price rejection. Hence, the rally might shortly hit the $0.93 support level. Source-Tradingview FTM Technical Analysis FTM coin price breaks below the descending support trendline, which demands a retest. Hence, a potential reversal from the $0.93 support could retest the bearish fallout. The 50-day EMA that has acted as a dynamic barrier multiple times gives a bearish crossover with the 200-day EMA, otherwise known as the death cross. With the downtrend gaining momentum, a bearish crossover of 100 and 200-day EMA is also in order. RSI Indicator: The falling RSI slope kisses the oversold boundary and might enter it shortly with the $1 fallout. Moreover, the 14-day SMA maintains the trend below the 50% mark.
