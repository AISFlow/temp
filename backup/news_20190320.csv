Dorsey, who also founded and runs Twitter, announced Wednesday evening that Square plans to hire three or four engineers and one designer ""to work full-time on open source contributions to the bitcoin/crypto ecosystem."" A Square spokesman said there was no additional information to share beyond the tweets.  Perhaps more notably, these new hires have the option of being paid in bitcoin, Dorsey said.  All work will be open source, and according to Dorsey, the new hires will not be focusing on Square's own commercial interests, but rather, ""on what's best for the crypto community.""  Dorsey has long been a proponent of bitcoin, repeatedly saying he hopes that bitcoin will become the internet's – and the world's – single native currency in the far future.  In Wednesday's tweet thread, Dorsey added that improving the crypto ecosystem seems to be ""the most impactful thing"" Square can do for the community, going on to say:  ""Square has taken a lot from the open source community to get us here. We haven’t given enough back. This is a small way to give back, and one that’s aligned with our broader interests: a more accessible global financial system for the internet.""  Square's Cash App already supports bitcoin purchases and sales, and Dorsey previously announced that it would support the Lightning Network, a layer-2 solution aimed at facilitating small, fast transactions.

42430294,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqwTh,1553119221,"WSJ's ShapeShift Exposé Overstated Money Laundering by $6 Million, Analysis Says","When it comes to cryptocurrency transactions, questions about alleged money-laundering quickly get thorny.  A Wall Street Journal investigation from last September, titled “How Dirty Money Disappears Into the Black Hole of Cryptocurrency,” claimed the crypto conversion platform ShapeShift had facilitated at least $9 million worth of money laundering over several years with “a parade of suspected criminals.”  Now, at ShapeShift’s request, the blockchain analytics firm CipherBlade recreated the 2018 report and found less than $3 million in transactions involving potentially “tainted” funds.  The main distinction here is that CipherBlade focused on allegedly tainted coins instead of the total value held in each affiliated wallet or account.  “Of the ShapeShift addresses which receive ETH within three hops from the initial dirty addresses, less than half of the ETH traded through them are tainted,” the CipherBlade report says. “Using the most generous assumptions, this is still only 23.53 percent of the WSJ’s claimed $9 million.”  Add to that ether to roughly 40 bitcoin, which ShapeShift itself found to be associated with suspicious wallet’s the WSJ identified, and the total estimate falls just shy of $3 million.  When asked about the investigative process, a WSJ spokesperson told CoinDesk:  ""An analysis looking at individual tainted ethereum coins, rather than tainted wallets, would be a different project than what the Journal embarked on, and one we can't comment on because we have not reviewed it.""  All parties agree the most pessimistic reading of the data still indicates questionable transactions made up a pittance of ShapeShift’s volume since the company was founded in 2014. According to a tweet by CEO Erik Voorhees, ShapeShift processed crypto worth $30.3 million a month in 2017 alone.  Still, experts such as Pawel Kuskowski, CEO of the analytics firm Coinfirm, told CoinDesk there’s no clear answer to how much may have been laundered through the platform – because until October 2018 ShapeShift did not perform know-your-customer (KYC) identity checks.  “If you don’t know the underlying clients, how do you know?” Kuskowski told CoinDesk. “This is why you have KYC in the first place, to understand the profile.”  When asked about whether it’s better to account for the whole wallet or focus on the tainted coins themselves, Kuskowski said the truth hides in the shades of gray in between. He said a complex analysis of the risks associated with the people involved in these transactions, along with “plausibility and some other rules,” all combine to reveal whether the wallets themselves should be considered tainted or suspicious.  In Coinfirm’s own report on risks associated with crypto platforms, ShapeShift was classified as “high risk” with regards to anti-money laundering procedures and compliance because of anonymous usage until the KYC policy began last October. According to Kuskowski, it often takes months for a traditional bank to de-risk after any association with money laundering.  “It’s a good direction, that’s for sure,” Kuskowski said of ShapeShift’s added KYC procedures.  Compliance overhaul  That de-risking process actually began months before the WSJ report, according to ShapeShift Chief Legal Officer Veronica McGregor.  “Among law enforcement, ShapeShift is regarded as a very helpful and cooperative player,” she told CoinDesk. “Just because we started implementing those KYC procedures does not mean that we didn’t already have procedures in place to detect fraud and bad wallet addresses and theft, things like that.”  The company was already working with external consultants to identify and block transactions from suspicious wallets, McGregor said. Then ShapeShift underwent a compliance overhaul throughout the second half of 2018, mandating KYC identity checks for all users and working with three independent analytics firms, Chainalysis, ComplyAdvantage and IDology.  McGregor said ShapeShift continues to “tweak” its procedures, both in-house and through work with the three aforementioned services providers, in order to keep up with the evolving technology.  Richard Sanders, CSO and co-founder of CipherBlade, told CoinDesk he believes the claims in the WSJ report were “grossly exaggerated.”  “We did find around $3 million, which isn’t a great look for ShapeShift,” Sanders said. “But it is significantly smaller than what the Wall Street Journal reported.” CipherBlade says its independent analysis was not paid for by ShapeShift.  For his part, ShapeShift’s Voorhees continues request the WSJ retract the report, which was published in September 2018 during the company’s compliance overhaul. He believes the methodology used to tally questionable funds was fundamentally flawed.  “Crypto is bringing light, truth, and openness to finance,” Voorhees told CoinDesk. “And it’s a pleasant irony that the transparency of blockchains so easily vindicates us from the narrative that the Journal has imagined into existence.”",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/20/wsjs-shapeshift-expose-overstated-money-laundering-by-6-million-analysis-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bcc1accf4fa96fd39dbec8335a6391df0062d8b5-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430295,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqwXh,1553113837,Welcome to Athens: Tezos Completes 'Historic' First Blockchain Vote,"The multimillion-dollar blockchain Tezos has officially concluded its first round of voting for two competing system-wide upgrade proposals.  Having raised a record fundraising amount of $232 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017, the Tezos blockchain officially launched last September. It was valued at over $1 billion at the time and presently sits at roughly $360 million in market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap.  Not without its fair share of internal governance conflicts, today marks the official close of the first round of voting on the Tezos blockchain. The two proposals dubbed 'Athens A' and 'Athens B' are the first of its kind to undergo Tezos’ protocol amendment procedures, designed to roll out system-wide upgrades otherwise known as hard forks in an entirely automated and self-governing fashion.  Having gathered a total of 25,855 community votes, Athens A won the majority of bids from bakers, the equivalent to miners on a traditional proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain, with a total of 18,181 votes.  But not all bakers on the Tezos blockchain voted. Over half of the baking community actually chose to abstain from the vote.  The Tezos Foundation – a non-profit entity in charge of funding development on the blockchain and controlling roughly one-third of total baking power – explained in a blog post:  ""The Tezos Foundation decided to remain neutral by not upvoting any proposals .... As noted, this contributes to the required quorum and further elevates the voices of other members of the Tezos community in this historic first vote.""  Proposed Changes  Athens A is set to introduce two different backwards-incompatible changes to the network.  First, computation limits per block – also called gas limits – will be increased on the Tezos blockchain to allow for larger transaction throughput. As founder of Cryptium Labs – the second most popular baker on Tezos – Awa Sun Yin explains in a blog post:  “If the gas limit is increased, it would enable more computation in blocks and operations, meaning that not only the maximum of transactions per block could increase, but also the complexity of the transactions.”  Second, roll sizes – which are aggregated Tezos tokens that bakers hold in order to be randomly selected in the block creation process – will be decreased from 10,000 XTZ to 8,000 XTZ.  As Jacob Arluck from the Tocqueville Group – a for-profit business development entity funded by the Tezos Foundation – explains in a blog post, the amendment would “incrementally” lower the barrier to entry for baking and subsequently, block creation.  Neither of these changes according to Yin are all that radical, but are rather geared toward “testing the actual on-chain governance process and setting a precedent for future protocol upgrades and proposals,” as stated in another blog post.  Agreeing with Yin that ""the main focus of this first vote is to demonstrate the amendment procedure itself and what it can achieve,"" CTO of Nomadic Labs – the developer group who put forth both Athens proposals – Benjamin Canou told CoinDesk:  ""It is worth mentioning that even though not radical and super technical, the changes are far from trivial. Take the proposed increase to the gas limit, for instance. It is mostly the change of a constant but just being able to have the community decide on this change is already a breakthrough.""  Now that the proposal voting period has ended, bakers on Tezos will enter into a roughly three-week period of “exploration.”  Next steps  The Exploration Vote Period is the second of four different stages the Athens proposal will move through before eventual activation on the live Tezos blockchain. In the exploration phase, bakers vote on whether to advance Athens A to a testing period.  After gaining a supermajority of votes to do so – that is 80 percent out of 80 percent quorum – the Athens proposal will advance to another three week period where the Tezos blockchain actually spawns a new but temporary blockchain network.  Lasting for 48 hours, this secondary blockchain will act as a test network activating the proposed code in advance and ensuring its proper function.  Given a smooth test activation, the last phase – also called the “promotion period” – reviews the proposal in its entirety for a final time and allows for one more community vote. Altogether, the whole process takes roughly three months to come to a conclusion.  As the first in a series of proposed upgrades to the Tezos’ blockchain still to come, Athens A will likely see activation sometime in late May.  “We are mainly interested in seeing the actual protocol upgrade and the entire Tezos’ community using the Athens protocol from the winning proposal,” said Andrew Paulicek – founder of Tezos baking service HappyTezos – to CoinDesk.  And pointing towards still more radical changes on the blockchain yet to come after Athens, Paulicek noted that he was particularly keen on seeing the integration of zero-knowledge cryptography such as zk-SNARKs also voted on in coming months.  Affirming these plans, Canou told CoinDesk:  ""We are indeed working on adding zero-knowledge cryptography via a future protocol upgrade proposal later this year. The exact shape that this integration will take is not yet decided.""

As it stands, the markets are still way down from the figures we witnessed this time last year, with no chance of a surge that will pull Bitcoin back to $20,000.00 expected anytime soon either. Earlier this week, IBM made a huge announcement with regards to their Blockchain World Wire Global Payment Network, an announcement that seems to have had a positive impact on Bitcoin and Stellar, though the rest of the markets have remained stagnant. It’s worth noting that Blockchain World Wire works on the Stellar network, so it’s no surprise that this news has benefitted XLM, which at the time of writing has a value of $0.113. I should mention that this is not investment advice, even though this news has helped push XLM and Bitcoin ever so slightly, it’s not going to cause the markets to sky rocket, therefore this should not be taken as investment advice. If you do decide to invest in Stellar, Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency, do so off your own back, informed by your own research. Only invest what you can afford to lose. According to Forbes, Marie Wieck, the General Manager at IBM Blockchain has said: ""We've created a new type of payment network designed to accelerate remittances and transform cross-border payments to facilitate the movement of money in countries that need it most. By creating a network where financial institutions support multiple digital assets, we expect to spur innovation and improve financial inclusion worldwide."" The major announcement from IBM came at the start of this week, when IBM announced that the Blockchain World Wire Network had seen an expansion across more than 50 countries, meaning a whole load of new countries had adopted this technology, therefore meaning that a load more people and institutions would start to use Stellars technology in order to settle payments. Great news for Stellar, bad news for Ripple - arguably Stellars closest rivals. “This partnership was a significant step forward for cryptocurrencies. This is because instead of Stellar trying to compete with chartered financial institutions, they were able to include them in a productive way that is beneficial to all parties involved.” Once the underdog in the shadow of Ripple, Stellar is now at the fore of international payments via the blockchain. The war between the two is hotting up, which can only result in the development of bigger and better blockchain technologies.

42430302,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqwjh,1553104821,'I'm Freaking Out': How It Feels to Hold the Bitcoin Lightning Torch,"""Hey are you set up with lightning? To send and receive lightning payments?""  The day I held the Lightning Torch was the day I learned how the lightning network works.  Living in Venezuela, the experimental payments network had somehow skipped my Twitter feed until I received the following message from renowned crypto advisor Jill Carlson.  She had the Torch and she wanted me to join.  I quickly came up to speed on the new game, and why it was attracting an increasing number of bitcoin users. (You can read here how it’s grown from a simple Twitter experiment to a payment that has now reached participants in over 50 countries.)  The Lightning Network Torch – better known by the Twitter hashtag #LNTorch – is a symbolic transaction, meant to teach how this new form of payment lets you send bitcoin faster and without paying fees on the blockchain every time.  Being a non-technological person, this didn’t promise to be fun at all. I accepted anyways. (I was also lucky enough to have Carlson as a technical guide through the process.)  Glitch in the Torch  Holding the Torch, however, is the easy part.  To receive the payment, I first needed to download a wallet that worked with Lightning Network (my regular bitcoin wallet wouldn’t do).  In my case, I chose BlueWallet. This allowed me to accept an invoice for the next amount to be paid in the chain (eg. 3,390,000 satoshis), respond to the tweet of the person announcing that holds the torch and wait to be chosen.  The next part wasn’t so simple. Something to take into account is that funding a Lightning wallet can take hours.  While the payment itself is very quick, it took Jill two hours to send the funds to my lightning wallet and another six hours for me to transfer them to the next person.  [AUTHOR'S NOTE: Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark, whose company is building a software implementation for lightning, says the delay is due to a bug in Bluewallet's wallet software.]  The payment works when two users create a payment channel on the bitcoin network, and once the channel is created (which can take a while), the network routes the payment from one node to another. This makes the transactions instant on the lightning network layer, but it takes a long while to get there.  While transactions fees are supposed to be practically nonexistent, in reality, various users have complained about losing money while sending transactions using BlueWallet, one of the most commonly used wallets with lightning network integrated.  And in order to hold the torch and pass it on, one must, of course, give away some money. A very low fraction of 0.0001 BTC that will be added to the trust chain. In my case, I was advised to have enough money in the BlueWallet to pay unexpected fees. I was to receive 0.0392 BTC and pay 0.0393 BTC to the next holder.  Even though I didn’t lose money, I came close to it since the application insisted that I lacked enough funds. The lightning fees are supposed to be below 100 satoshis, and I had an extra 300,000 satoshis available to make the payment.  When asked about this error, the BlueWallet team’s response was that the service still has bugs and that users must remember that it’s still in its beta phase.  For someone who has never used the Lightning Network before, this was a quite contrasting experience with more established bitcoin wallets, and definitely more stressful.  The worst part was the uncertainty of whether the funds had been sent properly or if I had ""dropped"" the torch!  Luckily, this didn’t happen.  Not only did the payment go smoothly, but Jill and I were able to send a message about how bitcoin as a technology that can transcend borders.  I felt a sense of responsibility.  This was a platform to shine a light on Venezuela’s situation indeed. That’s why I passed the torch to the project BitBros, a team from Caracas that survived the blackout with an active node using a 12V motorcycle battery.  Since then, the game has helped to spread awareness of projects like @btcven, a Venezuelan initiative that has received help for their fundraising through the Lightning Torch.  As a result, we’re all listed alongside Andreas Antonopoulos, Erik Voorhees and Meltem Demirors on an official websitehttps://www.takethetorch.online/Torch set up by Lightning Torch creator @Hodlnaut that tracks how the payment has been passed.  For now, the count keeps growing. The Lightning Torch has reached to 250 participants in 53 countries, going from 0.0001 BTC to 0.0395 BTC at press time.  But the torch won’t burn forever, as it’s creator assured. “There are only 33 spots left before we reach the limit of 4.29 million satoshi. I expect it to happen within a couple of weeks,” HODLnaut told CoinDesk.  Now that my turn has passed, the overall experience left me with a sense of belonging with the bitcoin community. It was an inspiration to keep learning more about the blockchain world.  Thanks again, Jill and all those building lightning.

42430288,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqwHh,1553097616,"Lock Up Ether, Get Free Crypto: Twist on Airdrops Attracts Top VCs","A startup offering a new twist on token airdrops has raised $2 million from a group of notable investors, CoinDesk has learned.  The investment in governance startup Commonwealth was led by 1confirmation, Canaan Partners and former Polychain partner Ryan Zurrer.  Commonwealth's new distribution approach, called a ""lockdrop,"" looks to maintain the high levels of interest that airdrops inspire, while adding a hurdle meant to attract the right investors.  As Commonwealth co-founder Dillon Chen explained to CoinDesk in an email:  ""Early active community members matter a lot. They create norms.""  With companies such as OpenSea, BloxRoute, Coinbase and Veil in its portfolio, 1confirmation is a familiar name in crypto, but Canaan is newer.  Founded in 1987, Canaan made successful investments in Web 2.0 breakouts including Match.com, LendingClub and Kabam. Canaan's other blockchain-related investments include gaming startup Forte, scaling project Skale Labs, Tari and Paxos.  With Commonwealth, these investors are betting that innovations in governance will differentiate blockchain investments going forward. People care more about something if they pay for it. But if they have to pay too much, one could also exclude potentially valuable community members.  To attain that influx of community interest, but dissuade those that just want crypto candy, Commonwealth came up with a new spin on the airdrop called a ""lockdrop"" for its EDG token, a governance and utility token for its first product, Edgeware.  ""Ethereum holders can participate in the lockdrop, they will be helping to provide security on a new network, kind of like a sidechain,"" Chen told CoinDesk.  Edgeware will be a network built to serve as a smart contract layer for Polkadot, a project of the Web3 Foundation and ethereum startup Parity. Best known as the project that lost over $150 million worth of ether, Polkadot intends to bring interoperability to the world's blockchains.  Edgeware will make it possible to bring smart-contract functionality to that network while running alongside it (on what Polkadot refers to as a parachain). Of note: Edgeware could be one of many smart contract parachains, depending on the needs of different developers.  ""I'm backing Edgeware because I'm really excited about crypto-governance,"" Zurrer, currently the director of the Web3 Foundation, told CoinDesk in an email.  How it works  The genesis block of Edgeware will create 5 billion EDG tokens, 90 percent of which will be distributed to participants in the lockdrop. After that, new tokens will be emitted at a fixed rate with each block.  To get EDG, users will need to hold ether. The amount of EDG they get will depend on how much they have and how long they decide to hold it.  ""The lockdrop represents a novel way for people to get involved at very low opportunity cost,"" Zurrer told CoinDesk. ""Since you get your ETH back at the end of your lock-up, you can obtain EDG and experiment in this new community without sacrificing your plans for your Ether.""  Users have four options: they can lock up for three months, six months or a year. They can also just signal the chain from their wallet, but that's by far the least lucrative.  So, a user with one ETH that locks for three months will get one share, six months gets 1.1 shares and a year gets 1.4. Signaling the smart contract only earns 0.6 shares and there's a delay – the signal option won't be paid out for a year after network launch, whereas all those who actually locked will get EDG as soon as Edgeware goes live.  An example: Let's imagine that instead of 5 billion tokens there will be 500. And let's imagine only four people take part, each choosing a different option with 10 ETH each. That would mean one had six shares, another had 10, another had 11 and the last had 14.  So, in this example, at network launch, the person who locked for three months would get 121.95 EDG. The person who locked for six months would get 134.146 EDG. The person who went for a year would get 170.73 EDG. A year after launch, the person who had only signaled would get 73.17 EDG.  But if instead of four people there were 40, with the same amount of ETH each and the same distribution, then each person would get only a tenth of the EDG as that shown in the example above.  It's impossible to know at this point how many people will participate and how many will join at which level, but the point here is to give interested ETH holders a hurdle to their free tokens – but not too much of a hurdle.  ""We think asking people to do the lockdrop can get us those early active community members,"" Commonwealth's Chen wrote.  The lockdrop will open on June 1 and potential participants will have until June 15 to choose their level of participation. Chen tells us that the blockchain should go live right after the contract closes, meaning that those in the lockdrop won't need to wait to claim their new tokens.  ""This will be very interesting, and I'm sure more novel mechanisms will emerge from this project that are beneficial to the whole industry,"" Zurrer wrote.  Built to rule  Edgeware is also ready-made for crypto's inevitable controversies.  Once live, it will come with a native voting mechanism so that no one will need to build a solution when a major controversy arises (as the ethereum community had to do after the DAO was hacked).  ""It solves the problem of an insecure vote,"" Chen wrote.  Following launch, Commonwealth looks forward to several new projects built around Edgeware, including creating an encrypted email platform that sends between various blockchain addresses, an anonymous voting system, becoming a Polkadot parachain and facilitating decentralized autonomous organizations.  ""We think Edgeware is complementary to both Ethereum and Polkadot,"" Chen wrote, adding:  ""The goal is to serve a more progressive segment of developers through WebAssembly contracts and instant finality. ""  Update (March 20, 18:55 UTC): Added additional clarity regarding the Edgeware parachain and the parties involved in the Polkadot project.

16284693,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/why-bitcoin-going-over-4k-is-a-good-sign-for-crypto,1553097600,Why Bitcoin Going Over $4k Is A Good Sign For Crypto,"When it started, Bitcoin was just an idea but ten years on, the cryptocurrency is leading an industry and is on the verge of taking over the world. A lot of this was down to the BTC take over in 2017 when the biggest cryptocurrency reached its high of $20,000. Of course, the price has since sunk down now but there has been no change to its underlying value. In fact, I would say that it’s safe to say that Bitcoin isn’t just only the most popular digital currency but is also a legitimate financial asset. This isn’t the case for all cryptocurrencies though. By the end of 2017, there was countless ICOs and at the start of 2018, there were even more scammers who were trying to jump on the bandwagon in a hope to get rich. Luckily, most of these scams weren’t very good ideas with around 60 percent of all ICOs in the first nine months of 2018 either vanishing into thin air or just failed to raise enough money for their project. Either that or they were forced to give refunds to their participants. Today though it seems that the majority of projects that managed to suffer through the bear market are led by teams with a lot of experience working to apply blockchain solutions to real-world problems. As the crypto industry continuously grows though, it will bring in more sophisticated retail investors as well as institutional money but there are challenges that lie ahead. There are still a lot of crypto enthusiasts that are pointing to security token offerings (STO) as a solution to ICO fraud and the continuous problems from regulators that have kept a lot of potential investors at bay over the past year. STOs aren’t that different from traditional securities aside from the fact that they rely on blockchain technology in order to make processes like paying out dividends or repaying loans more efficient. ICOs don’t give investors any rights to underlying assets and don’t force sellers to go through with anything at all. Security tokens, on the other hand, are tied to something tangible such as business profits or revenue but STOs still isn’t perfect. In theory, once a token is acquired, then the holder can do whatever they want with it so sellers are still able to violate regulations if the security is resold to another party unless the proper exemption is granted from the regulators. What doesn’t come as a surprise though is the US Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve many of those that have filed. Even so, cryptocurrency isn’t that far away from mainstream exchanges. In fact, some believe that it’s only a few years away whereas others believe that it could even happen at some point in 2019. Investors are already able to trade bitcoin futures on the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. If you are the owner of a company or an individual investor that is looking to get some exposure to crypto and there are a few steps you can take in order to lower the risks including giving your team some basic education. Don’t get me wrong, it’s okay if you’re not an expert, it’s not a simple thing you can learn in a day, but there is so much information out there about a whole new world that is right at your fingertips. The rise of Bitcoin was driven by a lot of hype thanks to mainstream media and a lot of new investors getting involved at the last minute and making some tragic losses when the bubble ‘burst’. Breaking $4,000 That bubble went from $20,000 all the way down below $3,500 in November last year and a lot of investors were extremely disappointed with a lot of the community packing up shop and leaving the industry. Over the past few months, the stability of Bitcoin has been relatively, well stable! Especially when you compare it to 2018, Bitcoin has been keeping itself in one place for the most part of 2019. There are a lot of companies that are entering the crypto space which could see companies move forward with the expansion of services and products, aggressively growing despite the vicious grip the bears have on the market. Yesterday, (19th March) the leading cryptocurrency seemingly broke above the $4,000 key resistance level which is a good sign of things for the digital asset in 2019. In addition to this, the positive movement of Bitcoin led to a lot of altcoins to make some gains of up to 30 percent.",POSITIVE,BTC | ICO,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | ICO | TOKEN SALE,,0,0,Crypto Daily,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/why-bitcoin-going-over-4k-is-a-good-sign-for-crypto,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/16284693.jpeg

The New Zealand-based exchange posted a notice on Twitter Wednesday, saying:  ""We have resumed trading on 40 trade pairs that we have quantified as secure. We will continue to expand this list as we clear more coins.""  The company is providing a full list of the available pairs on its support pages.  On Jan. 16, Cryptopia went offline stating that it “suffered a security breach which resulted in significant losses.” Since then, the firm has largely been quiet about the hack as it sought the help of local police to try and find the attackers and the missing funds.  On Feb. 27, Cryptopia disclosed the scale of the likely losses from the breach, saying: “We are continuing to work on assessing the impact incurred as a result of the hack in January. Currently, we have calculated that worst case 9.4% of our total holdings was stolen.”  The firm has not yet, however, put an official dollar figure on the loss or indicated which cryptocurrencies were affected. A blockchain data analytics firm estimated after the attack that as much as $16 million in ether and ERC-20 tokens could have lost.  From March 4, Cryptopia allowed users to access the site in read-only mode, and has since allowed very limited functionality, such as trade and standing order cancellations. It also said in a letter to users on March 17 that it is preparing to reimburse users who lost funds in the hack.  While it has restarted trading in some cryptocurrencies, the company said it still has issues with its fiat services.  On its news page, Cryptopia said today that New Zealand dollar deposits and withdrawals are ""currently suspended due to issues with banking service provision for NZDT.""

42430286,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqwFh,1553090437,Casa-Branded Case Brings Military Tech to Bitcoin Wallet Protection,"Bitcoin management startup Casa now offers a full suite of cypherpunk devices.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Casa just rolled out ""Faraday bags"" for hardware cryptocurrency wallets – protective cases made to block electronic signals often associated with remote wiping or alteration of the data stored on hardware devices.  “We didn’t see anyone else providing a good enough case. So we went to the extreme and found a pro in the market and designed this together,” Casa CEO Jeremy Welch told CoinDesk via email.  He added:  “We wanted something that would protect the device from a wide variety of potential risks, water, dust, etc., and also anything electronic, wireless signal, GPS, bluetooth, any kind of radio signal all the way up to and including any potential EMP [electromagnetic pulse] blasts.”  Welch says hundreds of Platinum and Diamond Casa members, paying upwards of $1,800 a year, have already received the cases as exclusive perks. Meanwhile up to 1,000 Lightning node buyers are eligible to get water-proof Faraday bags too if they claim the Gold membership associated with each node.  The startup offers branded hardware wallets in addition to the Faraday bags, key management mobile apps, the above-mentioned nodes and other services related to self-custodied bitcoin storage.  The protective case, manufactured in partnership with bug-blocking bag-makers Silent Pocket, can fit up to two devices along with cords.  Up until this point, most Faraday bag manufacturing has been for military and law enforcement clients. However, eDEC Digital Forensics software developer Matthew Huber, whose company sells up to 10,000 units a year to such clientele, told CoinDesk he’s seen a recent uptick in demand from privacy-conscious survivalists who want to shield their devices from geolocation tracking and hackers.  Huber said the bags are the best defensive technology on the market with regards to dangerous power surges and explosions. Even so, he added there is still a great deal of research needed to better understand electronics in war zones.  “Some people are concerned about EMPs,” he said:  “It would cause electromagnetic interference that could damage the product. The bag would help protect against that, although we don’t have any guarantee. There’s not really a whole lot of information about [EMPs].”  As such, Casa’s Welch said his team of roughly 20 employees will continue researching and improving the tools they provide clients interested in self-sovereign bitcoin management.  Plus, Casa collaborates with several device manufacturers across its offerings, including hardware wallet-makers Trezor and Ledger, to protect clients from supply-chain attacks specific to any device.  “This is about a full experience,” Welch said. “We’re looking to improve on that every year so that people will want to keep re-subscribing, and continue being a part of Casa.”  Speaking to Casa’s broader mission, Welch said the startup wants to make “key management and a node” in every home accessible to all. He added:  “If we can achieve that, we can totally rebuild the internet.""

Caspian announced Wednesday that it has integrated its platform with the Deribit exchange to offer futures and options (F&O) trading in crypto assets.  Deribit offers futures and options trading for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), and also provides another perpetual swap product for bitcoin. The exchange does not charge for deposits and withdrawals and ""up to 100x leverage"", Caspian said.  Robert Dykes, Caspian CEO, said:  “Our goal at Caspian is to provide crypto traders and investors the same standard of tools and service that exist in the traditional markets.""  The Caspian platform is connected to Deribit through an application programming interface (API) that supports “high volumes with ultra-low latency,” and provides traders with access to Deribit’s full options order book, Caspian said..  Caspian is a joint project between Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency investment firm Kenetic Capital and the U.S.-based based trading systems firm Tora.  The project raised $16 million in funding via a token presale last September, with backing from Kenetic Capital, Galaxy Capital, Octagon Strategy, Global Advisors and others.  Kenetic Capital managing director David Wills called Caspian “a frictionless on-ramp for crypto traders” at the time.  Back in 2017, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and CME Group both famously launched futures products.  Financial markets technology platform LevelTradingField launched a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange last August using the ethereum blockchain.

In fact, the capital of the nation, Seoul has been ranked as the world’s ‘leading digital city’ and the ‘tech capital of the world’. Kakao is one of the biggest messaging apps in the country and with more than 44 million active users it’s no surprise. Kakao is integrating a crypto wallet that allows users to use crypto on a day to day basis but in a more casual manner. Just the idea of 44 million people having the chance to use crypto is bullish on its own but what makes this even more interesting is that Kakao is South Korea’s biggest internet corporation. There are several products of Kakao including, KakaoPay, KakaoTaxi, KakaoStory, KakaoStock and of course, KakaoTalk. According to news outlets in South Korea, Kakao has already raised around $90 million in order to develop its own blockchain network called Klatyn. The main idea behind this network is to migrate Kakao’s existing platform onto the blockchain, the first of which is rumoured to be KakaoTalk. With this, the crypto wallet being implemented onto KakaeoTalk is a way to introduce Kakao users and the general public to Kakao’s own blockchain network. Industry executives have said that KakaoTalk is going to be used as a crypto wallet and allow users to send, receive and store cryptocurrencies whilst also enabling them to run several blockchain applications. At first, the use of Kakao’s crypto wallet will be on an opt-in basis. One executive who is familiar with Kakao’s cryptocurrency integration has said that the firm will need a cryptocurrency wallet in order to introduce its proprietary blockchain to the public and its users. “Kakao needs a cryptocurrency wallet for users of Klaytn and the best way to roll out the service is to integrate a crypto wallet into KakaoTalk, which over 80 percent of the population of South Korea use to communicate.” Similar to Kakao, South Korea’s Samsung has integrated a crypto wallet into the new Samsung Galaxy S10. More than 55 million people live in the nation and Kakao is one of the most popular platform out there in the country. With all this exposure, there is a lot of potential for adoption for cryptocurrency.

42430300,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMqwfh,1553079635,Bitcoin Struggles to Pass Key Price Resistance Over $4K,"View  Bitcoin could rise to recent highs near $4,200 in the short-term if prices validate the bullish outside reversal or ""engulfing"" candle created in the three days to March 16 with a convincing break above $4,040 (high of the engulfing candle).  Any spike to $4,200, however, would likely be short-lived as long as the 21-week simple moving average (currently located at $4,073) is sloping downwards.  A break below $3,927 (triangle low on the 4-hour chart) could yield a pullback to support lined up at $3,850.  Bitcoin's (BTC) bulls need to break key resistance at $4,040 to force a continued rally, the three-day chart indicates.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value is trapped in the range of 3,920-$4,020 for the fourth consecutive day, having created a bullish outside-reversal or ""engulfing"" candle in the three days to March 16.  A bullish engulfing candle occurs when the period begins with pessimism but ends on an optimistic note, engulfing the preceding period's price action. While it is widely considered a bullish signal, traders usually wait for confirmation in the form of strong follow through, preferably a convincing move above the high of the engulfing candle.  Put simply, a break above $4,040 – the high of the candle – is needed to validate the indicator. That would further reinforce the short-term bullish outlook put forward by the long-tailed doji candle created on Feb. 27 and allow a re-test of the recent highs near $4,200.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,986 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.3 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  3-day chart  The small doji candle created in the last three trading days has taken the shine off the preceding bullish outside reversal candle.  A convincing move above $4,040 (candle's high) will likely invite strong buying pressure and yield a rally to the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance, currently at $4,230.  That possibility looks likely, as the 5- and 10-candle moving averages (MAs) are biased bullish and BTC's price is still holding above the ascending trendline.  However, any gains above the 21-week simple moving average (SMA) at $4,073 could be short-lived, as that average is still trending south, as discussed earlier this week.  4-hour chart  On the 4-hour chart, BTC is struggling to force a descending triangle breakout, which, if confirmed, would boost the prospects of prices finding acceptance above the crucial resistance at $4,040.  A break below the triangle low of $3,927, however, could yield a deeper pullback to $3,850. That said, a bearish reversal would be confirmed only if the support at $3,658 (Feb. 27 low) is breached.

They have recently released the results of a survey they conducted which showed that nearly half of all the respondents said that they expect Ripple to see the most gains throughout 2019 compared to the other coins and tokens. The survey was conducted from 30th January - 20th February with around 11,000 people taking part with some very interesting results. Around 70 percent of the participants believe that cryptocurrencies are long-term investors and that there is a lot of potential for the future of these assets. Although the main reasons for investment are partially down to the potential of making money when it comes to crypto as well as the concerns had to do with market volatility and exchange security. There is also a big implication that the potential for high returns has a big home in the mind of the investor. The report claims that 90 percent of the participants entered the market after the highs of late 2017. The GMO Internet Group has started up its own crypto exchange called GMO via its subsidiary GMO Coin. Moreover, the firm has a brokerage and margin trading service which CMO Coin has dubbed as the Sales Office and Virtual Currency FX, respectively. In the crypto community, you either love or hate Ripple, there doesn’t seem to be an in between. When it comes to Japan though, XRP is a very popular asset. The country’s financial services firm, SBI Group is a big supporter of Ripple and the CEO of the firm believes that the token has a lot of potential. In fact, Yoshitaka Kitao is expecting every bank in the nation to use Ripple’s XRP token by the 2025 Osaka Expo. Japan is also making some ground when it comes to the regulation of cryptocurrency as the Financial Services Authority is currently reviewing whether it should hand licenses to about seven exchanges. On top of this, it is also planning to amend two acts and change the name of digital currencies to cryptographic assets in order to accommodate the new asset class in the existing legal framework.

The two aim to simplify the “complex challenges” of creating and managing security tokens. The new solution would be a “critical” component of seriesOne's digital securities offering ecosystem, the firm said.  Polymath sets out to be the ethereum of security tokens, according to its website. It's already developed its own token standards aimed to facilitate complaint trading and, last month, carried out a test showing how a decentralized exchange could be set up to only allow trades that were authorized.    “The token control layer that Polymath offers will be the future standard and we are excited to be working together,” said seriesOne CTO Dmitry Grinberg.    The ST-20 security token standard created by Polymath is an extension of the more generalized ethereum ERC-1400 standard that introduces the ability to restrict transfers of blockchain tokens.  Michael Mildenberger, seriesOne CEO, added that he is “confident” that using Polymath’s ST-20 protocol will “enhance the process of raising capital on our platform.""

42381727,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oTNN,1553054153,$25 Million in 2 Weeks: BlockFi Booms as Bitcoin and Ether Investors Seek Interest,"The Takeaway  BlockFi's interest-yielding deposit accounts, launched in beta in January and fully live this month, have attracted more than $35 million in crypto. Most of it is being lent to institutional borrowers.  BlockFi's terms of service give the company significant leeway over how it uses depositors' funds and what interest rate it can pay them. This flexibility is needed for the company to grow fast, CEO Zac Prince says.  Institutional investors borrow crypto at individualized terms, at interest rates from 4 to 12 percent, and BlockFi can call in the loans at any time.  When crypto prices move dramatically, BlockFi manages risks by making borrowers put up more collateral or selling some of it.  BlockFi is planning to roll out new products every six months and raise more capital.  BlockFi wasn't the first lending startup in the cryptocurrency market, but it's likely the one getting the most attention these days — including some heat from community members.  While it was founded in 2017, and began making fiat loans with crypto collateral in January 2018, the company was thrust into the spotlight earlier this month when it officially launched an interest-bearing deposit account. Seemingly too good to be true, the product entices investors with returns of up to 6.2 percent annually for holding their bitcoin or either.  So far, the product seems to be gaining traction. According to CEO and founder Zac Prince, users have already deposited more than $35 million worth of crypto, around 80 percent of it in bitcoin, into their interest-bearing accounts since beta testing began in January. Of that, $25 million, was gathered after the March 5 launch.  Yet skeptics almost immediately began looking under the hood.  For example, lawyer Stephen Palley noted that, while BlockFi is advertising 6.2 percent, according to the product's terms and conditions page, the company can modify the rate at its discretion. Others pointed out that, as the deposits won't be insured as they would be at a bank, ""your upside is limited to 6.2 percent whereas your downside is 100 percent"" if BlockFi fails.  Wall Street veteran Caitlin Long noted that by depositing their crypto with BlockFi, people expose themselves to a form of counterparty risk: ""I didn't see disclosure on that,"" she wrote, adding that by reserving the right to rehypothecate clients' funds – re-lend collateral already pledged to another lender – BlockFi may expose itself to legal challenges in some U.S. states.  Given the controversial yet clear market interest in this product, CoinDesk sat down with Prince to talk about the company's policies, how BlockFi's business works, and, most importantly, how it manages risk.  Lending fiat, borrowing crypto  BlockFi is currently offering two products to retail customers: cryptocurrency-backed loans and crypto-funded interest accounts. With the loans, the customer borrows U.S. dollars for one year at 4.5 percent interest, depositing bitcoin, litecoin or ether as collateral. They can only borrow up to 50 percent of what the pledged crypto is worth at the time.  Meanwhile, with the interest account, the customer deposits bitcoin or ether with BlockFi so that the asset can accumulate interest (denominated in crypto) every month. As mentioned, BlockFi is advertising a 6.2 percent annual compound interest rate for such accounts, which is two to three times better than a U.S.Treasury bond or a U.S. bank saving account yield.  But again, the terms and conditions explicitly say that the interest will be calculated by BlockFi at its discretion.  When asked if there is any benchmark BlockFi uses to determine the interest rate (the way, for example, a bank might take into account an index like LIBOR when setting the rate on a loan), Prince answered simply: ""No.""  The absence of any formula allows BlockFi to flexibly change the rate and make it more attractive to potential users, he said, explaining that for now, the product doesn't make money:  ""The rate is a combination of the market and customer acquisition costs. This product will be for some amount of time, probably for for 3 to 18 months, a loss leader. We are OK with losing money for a while. If it was purely formulaic we probably wouldn’t have enough control to make sure it’s attractive enough to a large amount of people to hit our customer acquisition targets.""  To grow its user base quickly, BlockFi is planning to roll out new products every six months and to raise more capital. (It has already done several venture funding rounds, the largest one – led by Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital – raising $52.2 million.)  Prince explained:  ""We believe that we will be able to continue raising venture capital supporting the growth and at a certain point down the road [when] we’re a much bigger company, maybe we’re a public company, then we can say: 'Ok, we turn to profit now.' We anticipate being able to raise larger and larger amounts of venture capital for a while, at least for the next couple of years.""  ...and lending crypto, too  The third thing BlockFi does, without advertising it to the retail market, is lend crypto to financial institutions. ""We don’t really think of it being a product,"" Prince said. ""We think of this as of something we need to do to be able to deliver our product to our core customer, which is retail.""  This third element is what allows BlockFi to earn crypto that can be used to pay interest to its retail depositors. (The fiat loans are in a separate bucket, funded from the venture capital BlockFi raised.)  Most of the $35 million in deposits gathered is being lent to institutional borrowers: of every deposit, a bigger part goes to the lending business and a smaller part stays as a reserve, but the exact ratio is not disclosed.  Gemini Trust, founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, was chosen to handle custody for BlockFi's clients, as well as the moving of crypto from the depositors to the institutional borrowers — BlockFi itself doesn't hold the cryptographic private keys controlling the funds, Prince said.  Currently, BlockFi's borrowers mostly belong to two groups, he said: people trading bitcoin futures and traditional financial institutions – in particular, proprietary trading firms and market makers.  The terms on which institutions borrow crypto vary on a case-by-case basis, Prince said. The interest rate can be between 4 and 12 percent, and the fiat collateral (which can be denominated in stablecoins, either the Gemini dollar or the Paxos Standard) can be between 110 and 150 percent of the loan amount. The relationships with borrowers are governed by individual ISDA agreements (the standard document governing over-the-counter derivatives transactions, made famous by the bestseller and movie ""The Big Short"").  The term of the loan can vary, but BlockFi reserves the right to call in the loan with one's week's notice — the same amount of notice a depositor can give to withdraw crypto. This clause ensures the company will always have enough crypto to meet withdrawal requests, according to Prince.  Managing risk  So what happens when crypto prices move significantly (as they often do)?  When the price goes down, clients' collateral will shrink, too, and the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of the loans will rise from 50 percent to a higher number. On the other hand, if prices soar, institutional crypto borrowers will find their loans much more expensive to pay back. But according to Prince, BlockFi has taken several measures to mitigate these risks.  For the fiat loans, if at some point the amount of cash a retail client borrowed becomes equal to 70 percent of the collateral instead of 50 percent, to return to a safer LTV ratio, BlockFi will contact the client and give them 72 hours to either pay back the loan, add more collateral or take no action. Choosing the third option means BlockFi will sell a part of the collateral on an exchange or through an OTC desk, use it to pay down the loan, and get the LTV ""back into the safe zone,"" as the terms and conditions page puts it.  The same mechanism works for institutional investors that borrow crypto: if the price of bitcoin goes up, and what they borrowed ends up costing more relative to the amount of cash collateral, BlockFi will contact them and ask them to add more cash. If the bitcoin price hits a certain preset level, which also varies from borrower to borrower, BlockFi can use the collateral to buy bitcoin and close out the loan.  The terms for institutions, again, are highly dependent on the level of trust a particular client has. As Prince put it:  ""If, say, JP Morgan wanted to borrow a million dollars from us, we probably wouldn’t need to take any collateral.""  Plus, the loans are structured so that if need be, BlockFi can chase after the deeper pockets behind a borrower. ""We’re making sure that we have passed through to a parent entity if we’re facing a subsidiary, in terms of a default,"" Prince said.  Legal and regulatory  In case the borrower defaults, taking them to court won't be a problem, Prince believes.  ""The legal structure we use to lend someone crypto is no different than we would use, say, to lend somebody USD secured by Japanese yen,"" he said.  As for regulatory compliance, BlockFi is a licensed lender in the states that require this — the cash loans are now available in 47 U.S. states.  ""The biggest state we don't support is Nevada because it requires you to have an office in the state, which isn't something we plan on doing in the near term,"" BlockFi's director of marketing Brad Michelson told CoinDesk. He wouldn't name the other two excluded states.  As for the interest accounts, they are available worldwide, except the states of New York, Connecticut and Washington and in any countries sanctioned by the U.S., the U.K. or the E.U.  BlockFi doesn't hold a New York State BitLicense, which explains why it lends but won't take deposits there.  ""For the crypto loans, we don’t believe we need a BitLicense,"" Prince said. ""For the interest accounts, we don’t believe we need one either, but our opinion on that is not strong enough for us to offer it here.""  The fine print  The terms and conditions on BlockFi's website say that the company ""will lend, sell, pledge, rehypothecate, assign, invest, use, commingle or otherwise dispose of funds and cryptocurrency assets to counterparties, and we will use our commercial best efforts to prevent losses,"" affording the lender significant leeway over its use of clients' funds.  Further, users waive their rights to obtain a paper copy of the contract, file a class action against BlockFi or request a jury trial. The company also can change the terms at any time and it's the user's responsibility to review them ""from time to time.""  Prince explained that what is described in the terms is just the real risk to a crypto investor, plainly stated.  ""There is this conundrum that you’re put in: you have to be really, really careful in terms of what your agreement says to protect your company, because crypto is in this regulatory grey area,"" he said. ""The Catch-22 is you have lawyers, you disclose any risk, you’re trying to protect your company from the regulators, but that means you need to write stuff like this.""  He added:  ""Scams don’t write stuff like this.""  As for rehypothecation, which Long and others consider antithetical to bitcoin's promise, Prince argues it's essential for the nascent crypto market to grow. One of the benefits of rehypothecation, he explained, is that it allows intermediaries to reduce trading fees and enable short selling.  ""If you don’t have a market that goes both ways, you can’t find the true price of an asset. Rehypothecation is the major component enabling that,"" he said.  At the end of the day, any investment is risky, and BlockFi is just being forthright about it, Prince argued, concluding:  ""Read a risk disclosure of, say, an IPO, and maybe in the end you say: 'This is the scariest thing ever, I’ll never invest in a stock again in my life!'""  UPDATE (Feb. 20 14:00 UTC): This article has been updated to give a more precise definition of rehypothecation.
