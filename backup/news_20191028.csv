42431134,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0B5h,1572300046,Avalon Bitcoin Miner Maker Canaan Officially Files for $400 Million US IPO,"Canaan Creative, the Avalon bitcoin miner maker and one of the world's largest mining equipment manufacturers, has just formally filed another attempt to go public – this time in the U.S.  Canaan's initial public offering prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Oct. 28 indicates it intends to list on NASDAQ under the ticker name CAN and sets a placeholder amount of $400 million for the raise. The final amount of intended raise, valuation and price per share offering have not been decided at this stage.  The filing shows the Hangzhou, China-based bitcoin miner maker lost $45.8 million for the six months ending June 30, 2019, on net revenue of $42.1 million, compared to $25 million profit on net revenue of $275 million for the first half of 2018.  Canaan said net income in full year 2018 was $8.3 million on net revenue of $394 million, as the bitcoin price plunged in the second half of 2018 from above $6,000 to around $3,000, causing many bitcoin miners to be unprofitable to operate. Notably, it had a net loss of $16.7 million in the second half of last year.  The filing marks the third attempt of Canaan in its efforts to go public, after its first and second trial in mainland China and Hong Kong, respectively, both fell through due to market uncertainties.  Chinese media  this month pegged Canaan's valuation at between $2 billion and $3 billion, with 126 million shares to be issued.  The company started considering giving it another go in either mainland China or the U.S. earlier this year and has reportedly filed a draft prospectus confidentially with the SEC in July. But a formal F-1 form was not made public until today.  Bitcoin's price jump this year has caused the demand for bitcoin mining equipment to outstrip the supply available from several major miner makers, which subsequently led to surging sales for leading manufacturers such as Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT. For instance, MicroBT, the maker of WhatsMiner, expects $400 million in revenue just for the third quarter of 2019.  Bitmain, on the other hand, is also reportedly seeking to go public in the U.S. after its long-anticipated IPO failed in Hong Kong as the local exchange and regulators remained uncertain on its sustainability.

42431117,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0AVh,1572296869,Paxos Wins SEC 'No-Action' Letter to Settle Equities on a Blockchain,"Paxos is seeking to modernize the equities settlement process using a regulator-approved blockchain process.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) granted Paxos Trust Company no-action relief Monday to settle equity securities trades on a blockchain platform for broker-dealers. Paxos announced that Credit Suisse and Société Générale would be the first two companies to utilize the new Paxos Settlement Service, which would operate on a private and permissioned network.  As envisioned, the service will let two parties bilaterally settle securities trades directly with each other. Monday’s announcement marks the first regulated platform for such trades, and should be more efficient than the existing legacy system.  Paxos has been working on the service for more than two years, said Melayna Ingram, Paxos’ head of securities products and the product director for the service.  While Paxos has similarly been working with the SEC for some 18 months, the company only began working to secure the no-action letter itself about six months ago, she told CoinDesk. The no-action relief will allow Paxos to operate its service within strict limitations so as to protect other market participants.  Ingram said:  “Paxos is using this no-action relief [as an] opportunity to launch this product [and] as a chance to both validate our understanding of the way that the product works and what the participants will need from us as well as the market appetite.""  The new service provides companies a method for settling equities “in a space where there’s been nothing new for close to 50 years,” Ingram said. The long-term vision for the company is to modernize the settlement process, she explained, adding:  “The front office and trading has had a ton of improvements in speed and the level of sophistication and the back office has largely gotten left by the wayside and so this is really this is I think a very meaningful step for the industry in ... making the back office aligned with the front office and then ultimately driving a path for firms to perform digital transformation of their back office and operations.”  The company will begin by settling U.S.-listed equities, said Paxos CEO and co-founder Charles Cascarilla. He added in a statement that the equities space is facing “unprecedented consolidation and economic pressures,” forcing the overall market infrastructure to modernize.  Building on  Ingram told CoinDesk that the company had been working with Credit Suisse and Société Générale through most of the past two years to design the product and determine how best to bring it live.  “They had given us lots of meaningful feedback, and they were able to step forward and work with us to become the first [few] early adopters,” she said.  Paxos has also reached out to a number of other companies, Ingram said. Now that Paxos has secured its no-action relief, she said other firms may also decide to sign on.  Credit Suisse head of digital asset markets Emmanuel Aidoo said in a statement that his company was “committed” to looking into new applications for blockchain technology to improve both Credit Suisse’s business as well as the customer experience.  SocGen COO Jeffrey Rosen added that by acting as an early adopter, “we will be able to tailor the system to our needs and introduce a technology that can positively impact our cost structure in both the immediate and long-term.”  Aidoo added:  “We believe the process of securities settlement can be greatly optimized using blockchain, and with Paxos Settlement Service we will benefit from these efficiencies first hand. We see this as a significant and important milestone in our Digital Asset Markets strategy and foresee opportunities to leverage this product across numerous asset classes in the future.”  Launching the Paxos Settlement Service allows the company to demonstrate how the company can combine digital assets with the securities space.  What’s more, “we’re doing so in a regulated way,” Paxos' Ingram said. “It was very important to us and it obviously took a lot of time and energy but it's very meaningful for us.""  Monday’s letter is the third granted by the SEC this year to a crypto company, and the first approving equities settlement. The regulator has previously granted TurnKey Jet and Pocketful of Quarters no-action relief to initiate token sales, provided those companies abided by stringent restrictions.

42431118,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0AZh,1572295513,"Ex-Official Trolls Libra, Says China Likely to Issue Digital Currency First","A former high-ranking Congressional official said China's central bank is likely to be the first to issue its own national digital currency, as he contended that Libra was doomed to fail.  Speaking at the Shanghai Bund Summit, Huang Qifan, former deputy director of the Congressional Financial and Economic Affairs Committee, explained how the national digital currency could affect the global financial market, according to a Chinese media report.  Huang said:  “I think the technology is getting more mature, and it is highly likely that China’s central bank will be the first to issue a national digital currency.”  In his speech, Huang affirmed the best way to fend off the stablecoins issued by private companies such as Facebook’s Libra is to let governments and central banks issue a country’s own digital currency.  “I personally don’t believe Libra will succeed,"" he said. ""Some companies attempt to challenge sovereign currency by issuing bitcoin or Libra. The decentralized blockchain-based currencies are not supported by sovereign credit and hard to become real wealth.”  The long-time economics pundit made his comments after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s announcement that he would encourage the country’s blockchain agenda along with a new cryptography law that could pave the way for the launch of China's national digital currency.  The People’s Bank of China started to conduct research on cryptocurrency as early as 2014, and aims to develop its national digital currency Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) via the Digital Currency Research Institute established in June 2017.  While Chinese officials said DCEP is not a copy of Facebook’s Libra, the central bank compares its national stablecoin with Libra in multiple official documents.  The central bank appointed former deputy director of Payment Systems Changchun Mu as the head of the research institute in September to accelerate the development of DCEP. The move came three months after Facebook officially announced its Libra initiative  Huang said he also envisions the value of DCEP to be pegged to the country’s credit, gold reserve, fiscal income and gross domestic product.  China is now one of many major economies exploring a national cryptocurrency and supporting blockchain technologies, according to Huang.  “Twenty four countries are currently developing the distributed ledger technology through more than 90 multinational companies,” Huang said.  The EU, Japan and Russia are trying to build international cryptocurrency payment networks to replace the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), a global financial institution that facilitates cross-border transactions.

42431125,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0Anh,1572294649,How Lebanon's Economic Crisis Highlights Bitcoin's Limitations,"Lebanon is far from a poster child for cryptocurrency adoption.  News of Lebanese banks shuttering to prevent a bank run was met with predictable enthusiasm from the global bitcoin commentariat. People in Lebanon can no longer send foreign currencies, mainly dollars and euros, abroad. Further, due to heavily restricted banking access and limited liquidity provided by established grassroots networks, most Lebanese civilians also struggle to acquire bitcoin.  Long-time bitcoiner Ali Askar, currently on the ground in Lebanon, told CoinDesk a few Telegram and WhatsApp groups for local traders have nearly doubled in size over the past year, with one such private group reaching roughly 300 members this past weekend. Following news of the banking limitations, the Beirut-based car dealership Rkein Motors promptly started accepting bitcoin payments this week. Clearly, awareness is spreading.  However, a stark disconnect between daily bitcoin users and the rest of the populace continues in a region plagued by economic and political conflict.  “Bitcoin will not help the people. It will help the politicians because they are the filthy rich ones who have access to money,” one anonymous bitcoin trader with family in Lebanon told CoinDesk. He uses a European bank account to buy bitcoin, then sends it to people on the ground in Lebanon.  “It [bitcoin] could help them, perhaps, if they were sitting at home with 24 hours worth of electricity and internet, and they could work online to get paid for their online work. That’s a utopian scenario,” he added. “In Lebanon, the internet is very expensive. Electricity doesn’t come often. We sometimes have electricity for just six hours a day.”  Another problem is access. Most bitcoin exchanges don’t serve Lebanese users. Plus, sources with knowledge of the situation say sanctions recently imposed against a Lebanese bank allegedly connected to the paramilitary group Hezbollah have made crypto companies wary about accepting transfers from any Lebanese banks.  As such, sources say bitcoin buyers are mindful to only list “digital goods,” not cryptocurrency, in any paperwork or digital messages related to buying bitcoin from Lebanon.  “It’s similar to Iran,” the anonymous trader said, adding:  “People and communities suffer [from sanctions] while the elite find alternatives and business continues as usual.”  Growing presence  To make matters worse for prospective bitcoiners, the rare exchanges serving Lebanese bank accounts price bitcoin purchases in dollars.  Due to rampant inflation of the Lebanese currency, buyers are offered a pittance in bitcoin for their fiat, sources on the ground tell CoinDesk. The same exorbitant fees for local on-ramps apply to grassroots trades as well, manifesting in the latter as premiums rather than currency conversion rates.  Four local traders listed on LocalBitcoins are working with bitcoin amounts worth more than $1,000 each. Because there are so few people on the ground willing to sell bitcoin for cash, such traders can generally charge a 10 percent premium compared to the broader market, one anonymous trader said.  Back in August, a Beirut-based bitcoiner told CoinDesk “there is demand, and supply, for over-the-counter [bitcoin] transactions” in Lebanon, although the local scene was unable to support the needs of less tech-savvy users. For example, Lebanese expat Eli Kopay in Finland told CoinDesk his family was trying to buy real estate when the banks shuttered international access. Now he’s trying to help his family, remotely, learn how to use crypto exchanges.  “All of a sudden you just can’t send you own money abroad,” Kopay said. “They don’t have bitcoin and my dad is so old-school that he doesn’t believe in bitcoin. … If it’s even possible [to buy bitcoin] now it would be too much [money].”  Despite all these hurdles, the anonymous trader is still advising Lebanese friends to find a way to buy bitcoin as they warily eye the threat of stricter capital controls on the horizon. Askar is even more optimistic about bitcoin’s prospects in Lebanon. He told CoinDesk:  “The amount being bought is increasing daily...We had many political round table discussions every night at the protest areas. In all discussions, bitcoin is present in one way or another,"" he said.

42431127,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0Ath,1572291615,Chinese Official Warns Libra Could Abet Illegal Cross-Border Transfers,"Libra must abide by international foreign exchange regulations or “it should be banned,” a senior Chinese regulator said Monday.  Sun Tianqi, chief accountant of China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), made the comments in an address to the Bund Summit in Shanghai, according to report by Reuters.  Sun called upon emerging market governments to consider curbing Libra's advance, especially if the stablecoin project would threaten a state’s capital controls or enable illegal transfers.  “Financial technology can promote the opening up, innovation and development of a country’s financial market,” said Sun, “but it could also bring a lot of illegal cross-border financial activities. This should be a matter of great concern to all countries, especially emerging markets.”  Sun’s concern lies with a foreign digital currency supplanting the yuan in domestic transactions, which would limit the state’s ability to enforce capital controls and foreign exchange management. Currently, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) exerts downward pressure on the yuan, weakening it against other major currencies in order to boost exports.  The comments are in line with public statements from other Chinese regulatory officials on the controversial Facebook-led initiative.  In July, former governor of the People's Bank of China Zhou Xiaochuan said Libra poses a threat to payments systems and national currencies. Wang Xin, head of the research bureau at the PBoC, said Facebook's venture has spurred development of China's ""digital yuan,"" initially proposed in 2014.  On Friday, President Xi said to “seize the opportunity"" afforded by blockchain. A recent registration list published by the Cyberspace Administration of China, shows that development of blockchain applications in China is advancing quickly, with more than 500 enterprise projects already underway.

42431121,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0Afh,1572290129,AT&amp;T Responds to Crypto Exec's SIM Swap Suit: See You in Court,"AT&T said it would fight a suit accusing it of negligence in a customer's loss of $1.7 million in a SIM swap.  The case was brought by Seth Shapiro  , VideoCoin's head of strategy, who blames the phone giant for allowing employees to transfer control of his phone number to criminals during a May 2018 hack.  Speaking to CoinDesk, AT&T spokesman Jim Greer said:  “It is unfortunate that Mr. Shapiro experienced this, but we dispute his allegations. We look forward to presenting our case in court.”  After a series of brazen SIM swaps, Shapiro said he lost $1.7 million in cryptocurrency. Hackers allegedly seized control of his cellphone, reset his email and breached his exchange accounts to steal $1 million from him, with the balance belonging to other people for upcoming investments.  Greer said AT&T was cautioning all its customers to bolster their security measures, and that mobile phone authentication is not enough:  “Recent high profile cases reinforce the importance of businesses and consumers taking steps to protect against SIM swap fraud, such as not using mobile phone numbers as the single source of security and authentication.”  But Shapiro's lawyer, Andrew Calderon, maintained that the underlying problem was not customer carelessness but ""systemic negligence"" by AT&T.  ""AT&T’s failure to secure Mr. Shapiro’s data is not an aberration,"" Calderon told CoinDesk. ""As explained in the complaint, AT&T has a rich and troubling heritage of taking less than adequate measures to protect its customers’ data from unauthorized access.""  To access Shapiro's SIM card, the hackers allegedly paid off AT&T employees – now since fired and being prosecuted in criminal court – to gain control.  According to Shapiro, the initial phone hack occurred during the May 2018 Consensus conference. On the same date, Shapiro's VideoCoin announced the close of a $50 million private coin offering, for which his related Alphabit Fund subscribed. Two colleagues of his in several ventures – entrepreneurs Chris Kitze and Enzo Villani – were also SIM hacked at the same time, but they did not lose any funds.  In April 2019, Joel Ortiz, the alleged 21-year-old mastermind of the Shapiro hack, was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison, after pleading no contest to charges that he orchestrated 13 SIM swaps. An accomplice, a 19-year-old minor, was charged in seven cases. Ortiz was alleged to have made off with $5.2 million, but only $400,000 was recovered.  Another high-profile SIM hack case was brought against AT&T last year,  when Michael Terpin, a crypto exec with a public relations firm, investment company and conference series, and a partner of Shapiro's in several of those ventures, said he lost $23.8 million when his phone was hacked.  Terpin sued the telephone company to reclaim his losses, in addition to $200 million in punitive damages and that the breach was a violation of the Federal Communication Act. The perpetrators were alleged to be a New York City-based, 21-year-old thief named Nicholas Truglia, along with his 16-year-old computer hacking accomplice.  According to an affidavit  filed by a Truglia friend caught up peripherally in his bust, the thief's M.O. was to have himself fraudulently added as an admin to a target's phone account, then proceed to a local AT&T store where he used his own ID to verify his identity and instruct an AT&T employee to make the changes to provide him access to the SIM.  The least secure security measure  The loss highlights an obvious question for security experts, who wondered why an experienced crypto executive would keep such high sums in an online exchange rather than ""cold storage"" – i.e. offline storage, where it would be completely shielded from remote hacks.  Relying on a cellphone to secure any part of one’s online security apparatus is a huge potential vulnerability, Haseeb Awan, CEO of the California-based SIM card security provider DontPort, told CoinDesk.  “People should avoid SMS [verification] whenever possible,” Awan said. “Two-factor authentication is probably the worst form of authentication,” because of the ease with which hackers compromise it.  Even without the AT&T moles alleged by Shapiro, Awan, himself the target of multiple SIM swaps, said hackers social engineer, trick and buy their way into victims’ mobile accounts every day, making the value of cellphone verification almost negligible.  Many people think they will never get hacked simply because they have never been before, Awan said:  “It’s kind of like saying you will never die because you haven’t yet.”  That hubris makes them even more vulnerable.  SIM swapping is a relatively well-known threat among high-profile crypto holders, who are often targeted because of their publicity and the heightened likelihood that they may hold valuable assets.  Shapiro, the current head of strategy for VideoCoin and founder of various crypto media projects, even told investigators that he immediately suspected SIM-swapping when his phone suddenly stopped working.  Awan said he was surprised Shapiro could have lost so much money so easily:  “He’s not some newbie. He’s been in crypto for a while.”  AT&T’s Greer said that offline storage is the only real solution:  “For cryptocurrency, security experts recommend further safeguards, such as keeping cryptocurrency in ‘cold storage,’ an offline environment that can’t be accessed via the internet, and following instructions regarding storage of wallet and exchange access credentials.”  Shapiro's lawyer Calderon, however, said it is not just crypto users who are hurt by these hacks.  ""Other victims have lost U.S. dollars and valuable personal information,"" he said. ""SIM swap attacks have affected people across the spectrum of economic standing. All data accessible through a mobile device is vulnerable when AT&T transfers account access to criminal hackers.""  It was unknown from the legal filings, which, if any, security products the executives had on their hacked phones.

42431123,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0Alh,1572286819,Inter-American Development Bank to Pilot Land Registries on Blockchain,"After years of talking about it, the Inter-American Development Bank is for the first time testing out a blockchain for land registries.  Next month, the global organization will embark on a two-year project to put land registration and lending in three Latin American countries on a blockchain.  The IADB, the largest source of development financing for Latin America and the Caribbean, has long been bullish on blockchain for land registries, despite the high costs of blockchain projects with sometimes uncertain returns.  The organization is working with blockchain startup ChromaWay and Bolivian IT services company Jalasoft to pilot the technology in Bolivia, Peru and Paraguay, with the goal of extending the test to other parts of South America.  “We need to work with our governments in Latin America to show them the potential of the technology,” said Eirivelthon Santos Lima, the project director of IADB’s environment, rural development and disaster risk management division in La Paz, Bolivia. “The issue is very abstract for them and the best way to teach them about this technology and get them interested is to show them how it works from scratch.”  The IADB hopes that ChromaWay’s blockchain can help ease the burden of efforts to reestablish proper land titles in Latin America countries, which can cost $50 million to $100 million per project, Lima added.  These projects usually involve the bank collecting the legal information of farmers and urbanites and technical information about properties to create a proper record of land ownership where land was sold informally.  Through its R&D arm, IDB Lab, the bank is putting $600,000 toward the project. Phase One will explore how to connect land registries to the blockchain in a way that creates more trust as well as what kind of blockchain to use.  The bank will rely on standards for blockchain technology developed by IDB Lab and LAC-ChaiN, an alliance to promote the use of blockchain in Latin America and the Carribbean. It will also use the World Wide Web Consortium (WC3) specification for verifiable claims and decentralized identifiers.  Partner’s track record  The IADB picked ChromaWay because it noticed the startup’s work in tracking land titles in Sweden, and similar projects running in Australia, Canada, and India.  “We’ve had up to 32 steps in the process to claim a property in Sweden, which could take up to three months between the buyer’s bank, seller’s bank and real estate agents,” said ChromaWay chief executive Henrik Hjelte. “We digitize this process and shorten the time to online in a few minutes.”  ChromaWay will apply several of its blockchain-related technologies for the project. This includes Postchain, which the firm describes as a blockchain rooted in relational databases, and Rell, a programming language for blockchain and smart contracts. The bank also has the option of deploying the project on ChromaWay’s public blockchain, known as Chromia.  Unlike a pure blockchain, ChromaWay’s tech also includes database capabilities like organizing and setting parameters on the data that is represented, the firm said.  “It’s basically a root based on a mathematical way to represent the data,” Hjelte said. “This way you cannot have the same Social Security number for more than one person, and you cannot sell the same property twice.”  IADB image by Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/10/28/inter-american-development-bank-to-pilot-land-registries-on-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a16d2dfa20e033e6aea409d99149c9ea09d17845-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403451,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfzLo,1572276538,China Wants Communist Party Members to Pledge Loyalty on Blockchain,"China's Communist Party (CPC) is taking its leader's support for blockchain to heart.  Following Xi Jinping's bombshell speech last week urging his countrymen to ""seize the opportunity"" created by the technology, the CPC released a decentralized app (dapp) for members to attest their loyalty on a blockchain.  According to a post from the CCP's propaganda office on Saturday, the dapp, in literal translation called ""Original Intentions Onchain,"" allows members to pledge their allegiance to the party and store it on a blockchain, which can be shared and seen by others.  The term ""Original Intentions"" is a specific phrase mentioned by Xi during his remarks at the 19th National Congress of the CPC in 2017, after which it became a significant propaganda and educational campaign for party members to stay committed to their party.  According to the post, the technology behind the dapp was developed by a Beijing-based company called Lingzhu Technology, which says it's a blockchain developer without much detail on its tech or the team behind it.  The company's registration data shows it has received investment from state-owned capital tied to China's Tsinghua University and claims it has developed a blockchain called OF.  In fact, this company issued a little-known cryptocurrency dubbed OFCoin and got it listed on exchanges like OKEx and CoinMex early in 2018, months after China cracked down on initial coin offerings and fiat-to-crypto trading.  OFCoin's price jumped by as much as 90 percent to $0.000326 on Saturday just hours after the CPC released the dapp and said that Lingzhu Technology is behind it. As of writing, the coin has fallen by 35 percent from that peak with just a few million dollars in daily trading volume.  It's not clear if Lingzhu has conducted any public sale of the tokens. The listing profilehttps://coinmex.zendesk.com/hc/zh-cn/articles/360007073972-OF-OFCOIN on CoinMex states that OFCoin planned a private token sale of 20 percent of its 51.2 billion OFCoin in January 2018 at a ratio of 300,000 OFCoin to 1 ether, when the ether price was about $1,000.  The rally in OFCoin is just one ripple effect in China from Xi's speech.  Primetime news  After the Xinhua News Agency published Xi's comment Friday, Xinwen Lianbo, the country's most-watched prime-time daily news program on China Central Television (CCTV), devoted five minutes of its 30 minute broadcast to the remark.  On Saturday, the People's Daily, an official mouthpiece, published a front-page article with Xi's comment on ""accelerating"" blockchain development.  Though state-owned media focused on blockchain technology, the market took it as official endorsement for bitcoin. Its price jumped more than 12 percent on Friday and surged to five-week highs above $10,000, before falling back to above $9,000.  So fervent was the market response, the CCTV cautioned viewers on Saturday to calm down and not take Xi's words as endorsement for all cryptocurrency. But the market surge continued anyway.  Chinese crypto projects  There were other signs of increased blockchain and bitcoin interest in China.  Searches for the terms in Chinese on Baidu, the country's biggest search engine, jumped 200 percent on Saturday, before falling back on Sunday. Similarly, searches on WeChat, China's dominant mobile messaging platform, saw strong gains following the news on Friday (see image).  And, as of writing, several major Chinese-born cryptos, including Qtum, Vechain, Ontology, NEO, Tron and Bytom, were enjoying strong gains on Monday, ranging from 25 percent to 90 percent.  Stocks reboot  The ripple effect has gone beyond crypto, with traded stocks tied blockchain or cryptocurrency seeing even more significant growth.  In the U.S., the price of Xunlei, a cloud computing firm listed on NASDAQ, shot up by 107 percent. The Shenzhen-based company said it has developed a proprietary high-throughput distributed network based on blockchain technology.  When the market opened in mainland China on Monday, the prices of more than 100 public companies that are somewhat tied blockchain in their business operations or product offerings, all grew by 10 percent on the day (the maximum allowed).  In Hong Kong, stocks of blockchain-associated companies also saw a significant uptick. For example, LEAP Holdings and Pantronics Holdings, the two shell companies bought by the founders of OKCoin and Huobi, both saw 50 percent-plus jumps on Monday morning China time.

In a blog post  , Bakkt chief product officer Mike Blandina wrote that the company was working on developing an app to let consumers use digital assets when purchasing goods from merchants.  ""We’ll be launching a consumer app to make it easy for consumers to discover and unlock the value of digital assets, as well as ways in which they can transact or track them. Merchants gain access to a broader set of customers with expanded spending power,"" Blandina wrote.  He hinted that the app might support more than just bitcoin, which is currently the only digital asset Bakkt and its parent company Intercontinental Exchange provide futures contracts for.  ""A key feature of the model we’ve designed is to support a superset of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies as seamlessly as investors transact in stocks in a retail brokerage account,"" he wrote. ""Our vision is to provide a consumer platform for managing a digital asset portfolio, whether they wish to store, transact, trade or transfer their assets.""  When ICE first announced Bakkt in August 2018, the company said it was partnering with Starbucks and other companies to provide a retail experience, but few details of this part of the vision have been shared since. Monday's announcement said Starbucks will be Bakkt's first launch partner when the app goes live sometime in the first half of 2020.  ""I have strong conviction that by driving more integration and efficiency across digital wallets, transaction processing and payment acceptance, there are meaningful opportunities for merchants and consumers to seamlessly interact using digital assets in ways that have not been previously considered,"" Blandina wrote, adding:  ""It is often said that digital assets will be successful when consumers don’t have to think about the technology underlying them.""

Announced Sunday, Envisible – a firm providing visibility into food supply chains – said it is working with Mastercard to offer a tracking system built with the payment giant's blockchain-based Provenance Solution.  Called Wholechain, the system has gained a notable early client for a pilot in the form of Topco Associates – the largest group purchasing organization in the U.S. Aiming to bring more transparency to its products, Topco will integrate Wholechain at member grocery chains, starting with Food City, to track and provide data on salmon, cod and shrimp products.  The technology will give members and customers a view into into ethical sourcing and environmental compliance of the seafood on offer at stores, Envisible said. It will further allow grocers to hone in on issues in the food chain during ""unfortunate events"" like recalls, said Dan Glei, executive vice president of merchandising and marketing at Food City.  Topco has close to 50 member-owners – including supermarkets, wholesale distributors and pharmacy companies – that collectively turn over nearly $170 billion in sales, according to its website.  Deborah Barta, senior vice president of innovation and startup engagement at Mastercard, said:  “The identity of things is becoming even more important as consumers raise demands for transparency. Our provenance solution leverages Mastercard’s established network capabilities, globally-scaled technology, and services, such as payments and counterfeit programs. This allows us to deliver trust, financial inclusion and back-end efficiencies to the marketplace.”  Mastercard's Provenance blockchain is not only aimed at the food industry. In August, the firm said it would demo the tracking solution during a showcase of women fashion designers. As well as offering customers insight into the route taken by the products on the way to the store shelf, Mastercard touted the tech as being a weapon in the fight against the rampant trade in fakes in the fashion industry.

There is no easy and secure way for airlines and government agencies to share or cross-reference your data.”  Writing in a company blog, LocalGlobal partner Remus Brett explained that Zamna's protocol can be implemented on other transportation networks as well, a factor that led to the firm investing in the company.

42403456,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfzPk,1572264007,Ghoulish NFTs Will Haunt the Blockchain This Halloween,"In crypto, where nothing is scarier than FOMO, there's no better time for an extremely limited release of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) than Halloween.  Take Decadenthttps://www.decadent.io/ founder Olive Allen, for example. She's using Oct. 31 to sell her first edition of 13 digital collectibles using a pop-up store on her website.  ""Thirteen is a great number,"" she said. ""Thirteen has some spookiness in it.""  There will only be one NFT of each of the 13 tokens in the first edition, but other editions of the collection may come down the road. If the business model shows promise, Allen plans to do more digital pop-ups (and maybe physical ones) in the future. She said:  ""It's not going to be the last one. Thirteen items is the first series. I feel like I want to do a series of follow-ups. Like a Christmas one. I want to tie the items to a certain date or a certain occasion.""  Though Allen wouldn't reveal too much about what the NFTs would actually look like, she did show us the concept art for one. The CryptoKitties-inspired image riffed on Batman's archnemesis, The Joker. Other NFTs will deal with things like net neutrality and decentralization.  ""There's this mix of current affairs and dark sensibility. And irony,"" she said.  The shop will be open all day long when it's Halloween in New York City, with each NFT being awarded to its highest bidder. One NFT involves a collaboration with an artist she wouldn't name but that she said people would likely recognize.  Spooky space ships  This seasonal spirit of dread is not limited to Decadent alone. Several other blockchain startups are letting a spooky mood settle over their product this season.  As Randy Saaf, the CEO of Lucid Sight, told CoinDesk in an interview:  ""Halloween is a very fun holiday for video games.""  Lucid Sight has been making games for some time, only recently adding a crypto element to its work. The company runs a game over Steam called Crypto Space Commander. It's a grinding and crafting game where players mine the universe for resources and use them to make things or acquire resources for trade.  Last year Lucid sold three ships with unique Halloween-themed skins via a descending-price Dutch auction. The company sold a fixed number of each ship, for a total of 48 ships sold. The highest price fetched for any of them was 3.2 ETH (roughly $540 at today's prices) and the lowest was 0.18 ETH.  Lucid will run a similar promotion this year – but there will also be ways to win themed ships. The event will be announced just before Halloween on the company's Discord channel.  The art for three Halloween ships has already been released, but there could be as many as six, Saaf said. The company likes to experiment with different promotions. It previously brought licensed Star Trek ships to the game.  SpookyKitties  Meanwhile, CryptoKitties announced a very different sort of promotion.  The game is giving users the recipe to breed a unique CryptoKitty. Remember, CryptoKitties didn't just introduce the idea of collectible items to crypto, the game also introduced a unique mechanic: players could ""breed"" two of their cats and create a new one.  CryptoKitties create ""events"" where players have a shot at breeding a fancy for a limited time if they breed cats that have the right set of attributes.  So this Halloween, the game's creator, Dapper Labs, floated a chance to breed ""Jack"" – a sort of headless horseman CryptoKitty. In fact, there was a chance to breed an extra rare ""shiny"" Jack. Unfortunately, someone had to do it by Oct. 5 and no one who tried got a ""shiny"" Jack before time ran out.  Now there will never be a Shiny Jack CryptoKitty among the 721 Jacks that were created on the ethereum blockchain. Maybe his ghost, though?  Meanwhile, another fancy cat is available now: Furmione. She'll be possible to hatch until the end of Halloween in the United States. To have a shot at her, the cats involved need to share the cattributes of ""poisonberry,"" ""spangled,"" ""mallowflower"" and ""firstblush.""  The company has a few other rare kitties available for sale with Halloween themes, and at least one whole Halloween trait.  Spooky cuties  Finally, Blockchain Cuties has a whole series of adventures planned for Halloween. Starting last week, players started getting benefits for exploring, breeding, beating mini-bosses and playing along in groups.  Last year the game released a set of NFTs called ""Bone Dragon Army."" Several sets appear ready to go for this Halloween.  Just remember: Anything can happen out there on the blockchains this time of year.

42403453,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfzMn,1572260461,Bitcoin's Four-Month Bear Trend Intact Even After 16% Price Rise,"View  Bitcoin remains trapped in a four-month falling channel despite registering double-digit gains last week.  Prices could pull back to former resistance-turned-support of $8,800 in the next 24 hours. The bearish case would be invalidated above $9,730.  A weekly close or two consecutive daily closes (UTC) above the falling channel hurdle at $9,730 are needed to confirm a resumption of the bull rally from April lows around $4,000.      Bitcoin (BTC) eked out double-digit gains last week, but failed to invalidate a four-month bearish trend.  The top cryptocurrency by market capitalization closed (UTC) at $9,557 on Sunday, representing a 16 percent gain from the weekly opening price of $8,237. That's the biggest weekly gain since the third week of June, when prices had rallied by 20.70 percent, according to Bitstamp data.  The week's performance looks more impressive if we take into account the fact that prices had dropped to five-month lows below $7,300 on Wednesday. The breakdown, however, was reversed and prices surged by 42 percent to $10,350 on Friday, following Chinese President Xi Jinping's encouraging comments on blockchain adoption.  The 16-percent gain seen last week is bitcoin's ninth double-digit weekly rise of 2019. A 26.73 percent rally seen in the first week of April is the biggest weekly gain of 2019 so far.  Back then, prices had jumped from $4,000 to $5,200, confirming a bullish breakout. The latest double-digit weekly gain, however, has failed to achieve the same, as seen in the chart below.  Bitcoin invalidated a bearish lower-highs set up with a convincing move above the Dec. 25 high of $4,236 in the first week of April. The bullish reversal confirmation paved the way for a solid rally to $13,880 by the end of June.  Since then, the cryptocurrency has charted a series of lower highs and lower lows, as illustrated by the trendlines connecting the June and August highs and July and September lows.  Prices jumped 16 percent last week, but failed to close above the upper edge of the four-month falling channel.  With the bearish channel still valid, it's too early to call a resumption of the bull market. For that, the bulls need to close the week (Sunday, UTC) above the channel resistance, currently at $9,730.  Last week's price rise was backed by a surge in trading volumes to the highest level since July. Hence, a strong follow-through cannot be ruled out.  That said, the short-term charts are calling a pullback to $8,800. At press time, BTC is changing hands a around $9,400 on Bitstamp, representing a 9.17 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  Daily and 4-hour charts  The long upper wick attached to Friday's and today's daily candle indicates buyer exhaustion above $10,000 and scope for a price pullback.  The bearish divergence of the relative strength index on the 4-hour line chart (above right) also indicates buyer exhaustion. A bearish divergence occurs when an indicator forms lower highs, contradicting higher highs on price.  As a result, a retest of $8,820 – the former resistance-turned-support of Oct. 11 high – could be in the offing in the next 24 hours.  The bearish divergence would be invalidated if prices rise above $9,730. Failed bearish patterns are powerful bullish signals. Hence, a break above $9,730 would likely yield a quick move above $10,000.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42403440,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfzCx,1572256809,Hyperledger Challenges Quorum for Enterprise Ethereum Crown,"There’s a seismic shift taking place in the enterprise blockchain space. It's called Besu.  A software client designed from scratch to connect businesses with the public ethereum network, Besu enjoys the support of Hyperledger, the Linux-like greenhouse for growing open-source blockchains.  As such, Besu has the clout to potentially eclipse all the other enterprise versions of ethereum, including megabank JPMorgan’s Quorum.  On the face of it, there’s plenty of Kumbaya refrains being sung around the ethereum campfire, with engineers at Quorum helping sponsor the inclusion of Besu into Hyperledger.  But scratch the surface and you’ll find an interesting pattern of chop and change underway. Take, for instance, ethereum stalwarts Adhara, an important application builder in the wholesale payments space, that recently flipped from using Quorum to Besu.  Adhara  was behind Project Khokha, which used Quorum to test zero-knowledge proofs with the South African Reserve Bank (SARB). Prior to that, Adhara co-founder Peter Munnings was also part of a Consensys team that tested Quorum with the Monetary Authority of Singapore.  Explaining the rationale behind the change of client, Munnings told CoinDesk:  “Besu has very serious enterprise-grade support agreement which is easy to access. The Quorum team is very focused on JPMorgan projects, so we are not finding the same level of response from them.”  Support networks  It’s probably fair to say that the popularity of Quorum caught the bank by surprise and there have been recurrent rumblings about JPMorgan spinning out the platform.  On the question of project support, a source close to JPMorgan’s Quorum engineering team said Adhara’s decision to seek more help from Hyperledger was a “fair point.” But the source stated that there is “a clear separation” between the Quorum engineering team and the bank’s use cases team, which looks after things like JPM Coin and the Interbank Information Network (IIN).  Quorum has 20 engineers who engage and support developers on Slack, Github and through global meetups, the source added.  By comparison, Pegasys, the engineering team linked to Consensys which built Besu, has some 71 staffers, of which about 40 engineers are working on the core Besu client and enterprise features. In addition, there’s the support that comes with Hyperledger involving numerous channels to promote projects, meetups in every major city, and an annual global forum (next to be held in Phoenix in March) where Besu is expected to play a starring role.  The frisson around Besu is spreading to other projects too. Consensys affiliate Kaleido is testing Besu, which brings Quorum-based consortia like Komgo within the ambit of Hyperledger, and similar shifts can be expected from other projects and teams within the Consensys stable.  Also worth mentioning are LACChain (a consortium of institutions across Latin America and Caribean attached to the Washington, D.C.-based Inter-American Development Bank) which ran a test net on Quorum; and Madrid-based startup ioBuilders, which has one product running on Quorum and another running on Besu.  Faisal Khan, strategy and business development lead at Pegasys, told CoinDesk:  “A lot of people have built pilots or are in production with Quorum and they are now doing PoCs or tests of Besu so that they can compare them.”  Holy Grail  Besu’s overarching selling point, said Khan, is its compatibility with the public ethereum chain.  “Our Holy Grail is finding secure, scalable ways for enterprises to connect to mainnet, either running their own nodes or running private consortiums with some kind of bridge,"" he said. ""So hopefully we will be releasing something on that in the next 3 or 4 months.”  Developers on the Quorum side would probably point out that the bank chose a fork of the mainnet Go ethereum client, which has been running most of the network and had more adoption and testing than anything else.  Another wrinkle concerns the slightly different versions of the Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance (IBFT) consensus algorithm run by Quorum and Besu, with the latter laying claim to a newer version, dubbed IBFT2. Munnings of Adhara, who has tested both versions, said the modified version is “more stable,” adding that IBFT2 is “unfortunately not compatible at the moment with the Quorum implementation but we are hoping that they will sort that out between them.”  In fact, there is an Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) working group called XBFT to address this that sports participants from Consensys, JPMorgan and Santander.  Besu might also enjoy favor from sections of the ethereum community who are less than comfortable with a megabank like JPMorgan being the biggest player out of its enterprise implementations.  Khan said JPMorgan Quorum has been a huge vote of confidence in ethereum and made it front-page news, but said of the discomfort: “I don’t think it’s particular to JPMorgan; I think you see a challenge in the blockchain industry when any one company starts a consortium.”  Summing it all up, Brian Behlendorf, executive director of Hyperledger, said the nature of competition between open-source projects is different from that between proprietary platforms. Quorum’s innovations will naturally flow into Besu, he said, rather than simply duking it out for supremacy.  However, Behlendorf added:  “I think for any open-source project to mature and actually become an industry movement, it does need multiple companies providing support and eventually things like administrator certification or being able to certify vendors. Those are two things that we have now jumped into at Hyperledger.”  Behlendorf revealed that he would have pitched Quorum by now, but for the fact that one of Hyperledger’s “hard and fast requirements” is that code has to be under an Apache software license. Quorum is intimately linked with the Go ethereum client and falls under General Public License (GPL).  “I respect that different people have different opinions about licenses; if that works for them then great. But that meant we couldn't pitch to Quorum, and I do think that is something they may have challenges with going forward.”  Brian Behlendorf image via CoinDesk archives",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/28/hyperledger-challenges-quorum-for-enterprise-ethereum-crown,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e38b0dcaef2e46161cd150292a025904b685acf0-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As reported by the local party mouthpiece Sichuan Daily on Monday, the Sichuan Decision-Making Consulting Committee, a government-backed think tank, hosted a meeting on Sunday to discuss topics around the province's future high-quality developments.  During the meeting, Yang Jiang, a former vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission and now a member of the think tank, said the combination of bitcoin, blockchain and excessive hydro energy in Sichuan should create more business opportunities in the region. The comment comes amid local authorities' continuous probe into bitcoin mining sites in Sichuan that are allegedly built without appropriate procedure.  Jiang added that currently 70 percent of all bitcoin gets mined in Sichuan, as its ample and cheap hydro power has been historically attractive to bitcoin miners. Although Jiang didn't explain the source of the 70 percent data, blockchain startup Coinshare estimated that, as of June this year, over half of the bitcoin mining power is located in Sichuan.  “Blockchain can be involved in every industry. Its main application in the financial sector is digital currency with bitcoin as a key example,"" Jiang was quoted as telling the committee members, adding that bitcoin mining requires cooling and computing, making it an energy-intense industry.  As such, Jiang suggested to the think tank that Sichuan should dedicate efforts to further study how Sichuan's plentiful hydro-energy can maintain its attractiveness to digital currency-related industries in an aim to explore new economic opportunity and growth force.  Jiang is also currently a member of the China People's Political Consultative Conference, which is a central-level political legislative advisory body consisting of prominent figures in the political and business sector.  Although Jiang's comment serves as a recommendation and will not necessarily lead to any policy change, it came just days after members of the Committee hosted a seminar in Sichuan's capital Chengdu discussing how to better utilize excessive energy in Sichuan for digital economy while transforming bitcoin mining into a more professional data center business.  This is also not the first time that Jiang voiced support for the crypto mining industry.

Casey is CoinDesk's chief content officer and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      The Chinese government is not in the habit of making speculative “what if” announcements. Typically, before anything about its plans goes public, a significant amount of preparation and thought has gone into it.  So, although Xi Jinping’s passing statement about China needing to “seize the opportunity” posed by blockchain technology was thin on details, it’s unwise to assume nothing will come of it. In fact, as CoinDesk’s David Pan reported on Monday, there’s already a massive amount of blockchain development going on in China.  How should the U.S. react to this? Definitely not with complacency.  The news out of China affirms Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s warning to Congress during last week’s contentious testimony over his company’s plans for the Libra cryptocurrency that the U.S. is at risk of falling behind the innovation curve. China is powering ahead, while the U.S. is bickering over a project that will be stalled in prototype testing phase for a long time and is throwing regulatory roadblocks in the way of countless other cryptocurrency ideas.  There is some there there  To be sure, many in the crypto community are dismissive of China’s blockchain strategy. That’s because it is most certainly based on a permissioned framework that implies significant centralization, with distributed ledgers managed by regulated trusted entities (if not directly controlled by the government, by consortia and other organizations subject to heavy oversight and Beijing’s intervention threats.  In that sense, China’s blockchain architecture will likely be a long way from the decentralized, trustless principles upon which bitcoin, ethereum and other public blockchains are based.  An exasperated Nic Carter took to Twitter Friday to state why he thought Xi’s “blockchain” reference was meaningless and why arguments attributing bitcoin’s massive rally to the Chinese leader’s comments were, in his mind, bunk.    So just because xi jinping said “blockchain” were all gonna pretend that it means something?        — nic carter (@nic__carter) October 25, 2019      But Xi’s comments did amount to “something.”  Just because China’s approach to distributed ledgers falls short of the ideals of cryptocurrency and likely involves use cases that could be just as well managed with a SQL database doesn’t mean we can walk away and ignore what’s happening there.  We must consider these moves in the context of other advances China is making in related fields. It is secretly developing a central bank digital currency, for one, and just passed a new cryptography law to enable the development of powerful new mathematical tools for managing information (potentially for the worse, if these tools are put in the hands of Beijing’s surveillance apparatus.)  Integrating a stablecoin and future cryptographic tools such as zero-knowledge proofs, and other forms of homomorphic encryption such as MPC wallets into China’s “Blockchain +” framework for related technologies could unlock efficiencies that give China’s economy real competitive advantages. Perhaps it enables the smart contract-based approach to foreign exchange risk that I flagged last month.  Or maybe it results in new compliance solutions for regulated entities such as banks to identify and onboard people and businesses. Or could it lead to more efficient Chinese customs procedures to speed up supply chains within China’s multinational Belt and Road project?  Response?  All these could give China a competitive economic advantage. And the more it develops them, the deeper its learning and capabilities will become.  Again, how should the U.S. respond?  Ideally, it would embrace the kind of approach to technological development that China simply can’t afford to take: the open, permissionless, decentralized one preferred by the crypto critics of closed, permissioned, centralized blockchain solutions.  Permissionlessness, as it pertains to blockchain technology, means an open architecture in which anyone can use or develop applications on a designated protocol and that there are no centralized gatekeepers saying yay or nay to actors or transactions on the network. And while that spooks the hell out of U.S. financial regulators who are used to monitoring payments for anti-money laundering and illicit finance enforcement, it’s more or less consistent with what long has been the U.S. stance on economic principles. It’s part of a long tradition in U.S. economic thinking that sees economic outcomes as positive-sum phenomena, where the more transactional activity that’s allowed, the more value and wealth is created.  Sadly, openness is much less of an American economic priority now, mostly in the international sphere, but also domestically. The Trump Administration’s protectionist approach to trade – marked by its brutal tariff war with China - and the President’s proclivity to reward or punish favorite industries and treat every negotiation as a winner-take-all “Art of the Deal” reflects the inward, closed mindset of zero-sum game thinking.  Yet the U.S. has a long history of beating its foes by being more open than them. That’s what the Cold War victory, largely engineered by a Republican president, Ronald Reagan, was all about. The same tradition continued under a Democrat administration during the post-Cold War era of Bill Clinton. Back then, amid a wave of free trade agreements and neoliberal reforms around the world, American diplomacy laid the foundation for the open Internet.  Having set the example of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which forced the Baby Bells to accept competition, the U.S. used carrot and stick tactics to get other countries to follow suit. Creaking old government-owned telcos were privatized in developing countries, foreign competitors were allowed in, and investment flowed into the fiberoptic cable and switching technologies that would let the Internet grow.  A new chance to open up  Those were the days. The question is: can they be relived?  Well, the international to and fro that’s defining the regulatory and technical framework for cryptocurrency and blockchain technology may offer an opening. If the goal here is to ensure that Western models of business and government outcompete the state-led business titans of China, then a move to promote an open, permissionless approach to this vital technology may be the way to pressure Beijing.  China’s closed system of government simply can’t abide a permissionless structure over which it can have no control. But, in theory, the U.S., which its open innovation and competition model, can be more comfortable within it. It can take heart from the lesson of the 1990s, which was that open models of development will beat closed ones: the online world was won by the TCP/IP-founded open Internet, not by closed-loop intranet networks such as AOL and France’s Minitel. Ergo, an America that embraces permissionless innovation and open blockchain models has a chance to outcompete China.  I’m not holding my breath for such a policy stance in Washington, one that would mean removing roadblocks to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, including Libra and other stablecoins. For one, even tacitly encouraging their adoption could ultimately entail abandoning the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. Although that’s the right thing to do, it’s almost unfathomable as a policy decision.  And secondly, as I mentioned, Donald Trump is a closed-loop, zero-sum-game politician. He’s already made his disdain for bitcoin clear.  But America is still a democracy. The political environment could change. Let’s hope that whoever next leads it can see the opportunity to take on China with openness rather than tit-for-tat retribution.

According to releases from the company and the investor, Financial Products Group (FPG) purchased 499,968,000 yen worth of shares from the Japanese subsidiary of Singapore-incorporated Huobi Asset Investments on Oct. 25.  FPG said it bought into the company because of its prospects, as Huobi Japan will be developing solutions related to virtual currencies and payments, and the two may plan to collaborate on projects related to tokenization of the securities market, given FPG's expertise in finance and real estate.  The exact use of funds was not detailed, though the companies said the new capital will be deployed in financing Huobi Japan's expansion in the country.  It is not clear from the announcement what percentage of ownership the Japanese investment company will receive, though the disclosure did say that Huobi Japan's paid-up capital was $5.7 million, while the company's website puts total capital, including reserves, at $11 million as of February 2019.

42403442,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfzDw,1572229801,"From Banking Giants to Tech Darlings, China Reveals Over 500 Enterprise Blockchain Projects","The Takeaway:  More than 500 blockchain projects have been registered with the Chinese government since March.  The filings reveal some of the largest Chinese banks and tech companies working with the technology.  Several government offices, including courts and tax bureaus, are testing blockchain platforms to execute administrative tasks, the filings show.  Chinese president Xi Jinping announced his support for blockchain technology, while Congress passed a cryptography law one day after Xi's comment.      As President Xi Jinping called on his countrymen to seize opportunities in distributed ledger technology, China’s industry heavyweights were already leading hundreds of enterprise blockchain projects.  In total, the identities of 506 such projects have been published by the Cyberspace Administration of China, which, since January, has required every entity developing blockchain technologies to register their projects for further supervision.  The information released so far is from two lists - 197 projects named in March and 309 in October - and offers a trove of insight into hundreds of enterprise blockchain projects under development in China.  More lists could be published, but these large tranches already include some of the largest Chinese state-owned banks and commercial tech conglomerates, as well as the many government and public sector projects that define China’s economy today.  Many other potentially important developments were partially disguised by listing the projects under the names of related subsidiaries. In addition, there are many known blockchain projects absent from the two lists, but could likely be published in another installment.  In total, CoinDesk is able to reveal thumbnail sketches of several enterprise blockchain projects that could change the landscape of the Chinese technology industry.  Financial services  Trade finance, asset management, cross-border payments and supply chain financing were the four most common use cases in the financial service industry projects included in the two lists.  Six banks, including two major state-owned national banks and four local banks, have filed for 14 blockchain projects.  Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the world’s largest bank by assets, and Ping An Bank, the banking arm of Ping An Insurance, have registered two blockchain projects each.  Ping An Bank disclosed a data analytics SAS plat­form and a blockchain-dri­ven vot­ing and decision-making sys­tem. The bank became the first Chinese financial institution in the R3 enterprise blockchain alliance in 2016, and has adopted a blockchain network called FiMax to improve data-sharing and privacy processes. Its goal was to increase efficiencies in asset-backed securities transactions, and tackle challenges in supply chain financing.  Union Pay, the Chinese counterpart of Visa or Mastercard, filed two blockchain services, including a digital certificate application and a blockchain-based tracking platform for cross-border capital transfers.  ICBC Xi Blockchain Ser­vice and ICBC Fi­nan­cial Ser­vices are blockchain projects to facilitate transactions for the bank's clients. ICBC partnered with China’s central bank, the People's Bank of China, in 2017 to conduct research on blockchain technology, and launched its blockchain-based financing platform for small and medium-sized companies.  While not on the list, two major banks had recently published much more detail on their blockchain projects, as reported earlier by CoinDesk.  China Construction Bank (CCB), one of the four major Chinese commercial banks, is revamping its trade finance blockchain-based platform, as trading volume on the platform reached $53 billion. CCB’s projects included facilitating financial transactions such as factoring and forfaiting, providing immediate cash for exporters in exchange for short-term receivables.  Also, the Bank of China completed its first international money transfer to South Korea in dollars via its patented blockchain payment system last year.  Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent  On the list is Baidu, the Chinese search engine giant, which released its blockchain white paper, detailing its patented Xuper Chain that aims to provide foundational infrastructure for blockchain services.  The company had also launched a decentralized application, or dapp, game called Letsdog last August, similar to the internet sensation CryptoKitties. The project is registered through Baidu’s blockchain subsidiary Duxiaoman on the October list.  Another two Baidu projects were included in the March list, including Baidu Blockchain Engine providing cloud services and Token that leverages blockchain to protect digital content intellectual property rights.  Alibaba Group is in a perpetual race for No. 1 against Baidu, Tencent and internet conglomerate Huawei for which of the four will develop the most advanced blockchain cloud services in China.  Each company filed information about its blockchain cloud services, according to the registration data. All four of their blockchain white papers stressed the importance of developing blockchain-based cloud services as infrastructure providers for third-parties.  Alibaba has been especially active, topping another list - the most patent applications focused on blockchain-related technologies - with a total of 90 projects, surpassing IBM and Bank of America.  Tencent, parent of messaging app WeChat, has been building a suite of blockchain services since their first white paper was released in 2017. On the list, the internet giant filed its registration for Tencent Blockchain and Tencent Cloud TBaaS Blockchain.  The company’s TrustSQL platform is designed as a three-part system with the core chain layer, a product and service layer, and an application layer to provide digital asset management and authentication.  The company partnered with Intel to develop a blockchain for Internet of Things applications, while starting to test blockchain financial applications with the Bank of China in 2017.  Government-Led Projects  The Chinese government, itself, was heavily involved in many of the large-scale projects registered on the lists, from communication backbones to innovations in legal and land development use cases.  Union Pay, China’s answer to VISA-Mastercard, was mentioned on the list, with a cross border payment project.  This month, Chinese media reported the start of a test phase of a Union Pay project, partnered with five other institutions, including China Mobile and the State Information Center, to launch the Blockchain Services Network (BSN), a nationwide blockchain infrastructure project envisioned to be the “Android or Apple’s IOS system” for the blockchain.  Yifan He, the CEO of Beijing Red Date Tech, one of the six institutions, said at the announcement that BSN is already being tested at 55 cities in China, plus Singapore.  The network claims to be more cost-effective than cloud services currently provided by Tencent, Huawei or Alibaba.  There were also many examples that the government is directly using blockchain to provide services, from legal arbitration, tax collection to daily management of a compensation tracking platform for relocated farmers.  The Beijing and Guangzhou Internet Court each registered their blockchain-based platform. The first Internet court in China, and the world, opened in Hangzhou, in southern China, in 2017.  These Internet courts are already authorized to process certain Internet-related cases such as online financing, online IP disputes and small loan contract disputes. The courts migrate every step of the legal process online, including prosecution, settlement, evidence presentation and verdict delivery.  legalXchain  registered three blockchain services that are based on legalXchain, LegalFabric and the Hyperledger. The firm claimed to be a blockchain technology company designing projects specifically for the legal sector in China, according to its website.  Another unique project is for a “new city” being built over swampland, 60 miles southwest of Beijing. As that city surpasses 21 million inhabitants, a decision was taken to build Xiong’an, meaning “brave and peace,” by purchasing land from local farmers. Those transactions will now all be made via blockchain to keep the transparent and organized. .A recent Brookings Institute report said that $380 billion is going into the new city. .  One of the three projects on the list for the new city is called the Xiong’an Blockchain Land Compensation Distribution Platform, which would be responsible for distributing financial subsidies for relocated residents in the area.  More blockchain services used for the government included Blockchain Electronic Invoice, for the State Administration of Taxation Shenzhen branch, and Cross-Border Transactions Platform, for the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.  Everything Else  Many more names and projects were identified on the list, although it was hard to completely identify all of them.  Two more from well-known companies include one from video streaming company iQIYI - China’s answer to Netflix - which filed that it is using Baidu Xuper Chain Supernode to improve its streaming services. Another was from BGI, one of the largest life science and genomics companies in China, which registered BGI Blockchain BaaS Platform to conduct genetic analysis.  A third company, with a very interesting use case was from Jingde Porcelain, with a smart blockchain project to authenticate its porcelain products; the company is famous for their blue and white plates and vases.  A fourth project was registered by the Shenzhen Charity Lottery Distribution Center, to verify winning tickets. And a fifth is an invoice processing platform on the blockchain for Midea, a large consumer appliances manufacturer.

42403455,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfzNm,1572226208,Bitcoin Leads Momentum as Top Cryptos Trade Below Key Price Average,"Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin SV (BSV) are the only cryptocurrencies within the top 10 by market capitalization to have jumped back above their long-term moving averages.  The 200-day moving average (MA) is often regarded as a marker for bullish long-term health when prices are above and bearish long-term market health when prices reside below.Bitcoin’s (BTC) 30 percent jump to 5-week highs from $7,393 to $10,350 over a 2-day period pulled prices back above the long-term moving average, marking a change in both momentum and sentiment for the world’s premiere crypto.  Bitcoin SV (BSV) already led the charge a day earlier, closing above the 200-day MA on Oct. 25.  Still, those moves are yet to be reflected in the remaining top 10 cryptos as the bulls struggle for supremacy from the consistent 4-month downward slide that began towards the end of June, 2019.    BTC and BSV - Daily chart    As seen above, BTC and BSV both managed to rise above the 200-day MA with conviction, leading to expectations for further appreciation in price as it heads toward the monthly close for October.  Still, significant leg work for the remaining eight cryptos out of the top 10 is required to convince traders of a major change in trend for altcoins, which could encourage further investment in projects such as Ether and XRP as optimism begins to build off China’s positive pivot towards crypto.    Altcoins - Daily chart    XRP, Ether, Litecoin, bitcoin cash, EOS, Binance coin and Stellar still reside beneath the 200-day MA despite gaining between 11.45 and 22 percent in a single period on Oct. 26.  The weekend move caught many traders off-guard as BTC broke out on its third-best single-day price gain in its history, as noted by Yassine Elmandjra.  Still, more is required from buyers looking to drive alternative crypto’s performances higher, which is currently mired by BTC’s near 70 percent market dominance.  Should the rest of the top 10 cryptocurrencies follow suit by rising above their respective 200-day moving averages, that would add credence to further price gains as the markets head toward the BTC halving event in May 2020.  Confidence in BTC has been restored for now, but how long that will last and to what effect it has on the rest of the top 10 remains to be seen.
