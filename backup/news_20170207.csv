42399604,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjt68,1486507145,Bitcoin Volatility Tightens After Prices Surge to 1-Month High,"Bitcoin prices entered rangebound trading today after soaring to their highest level in over a month.  Earlier in the session, the digital currency's price climbed roughly 3%, peaking at an average of $1,054.73 – the highest since 5th January, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  The price rally came as traders responded to a recent uptick in market sentiment and overnight reports that the People's Bank of China's foreign exchange reserves had declined.  Following this ascent, bitcoin prices pulled back somewhat, falling slightly lower to $1,046.24 by 15:30 UTC, a less than 1% decline from the daily high, BPI data shows. The digital currency's price began to rise once again over the next few hours, increasing by 0.3% to $1,049.83 by 17:45 UTC.  These modest fluctuations continued over the next several hours, with bitcoin prices dropping 0.2% to $1,047.46 at 19:30 UTC and then appreciating 0.3% to $1,050.67 by 21:00 UTC.  At press time, the average price of bitcoin is $1,051.75, according to the BPI.  The relative lack of volatility that bitcoin prices saw during the latter part of today's session may be the latest sign that the digital currency is experiencing a new trend of more modest price fluctuations.  This reduced volatility has become more apparent since major Chinese exchanges BTCC, OKCoin and Huobi opted to eliminate margin trading and begin charging trading fees.

42399596,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjsyG,1486497651,Arizona Bill Would Make Blockchain Smart Contracts 'Legal',"An Arizona legislator wants to amend state law to account for blockchain signatures and smart contracts, public records show.  HB 2417  , introduced on 6th February, would make a signature enshrined on a blockchain a legal signature under Arizona law. Conversely, any ""record or contract"" secured by a blockchain would be ""considered to be in an electronic format and to be an electronic record"". The bill was put forward by state representative Jeff Weninger.  Notably, the bill’s language also explicitly accounts for the use of smart contracts, or self-executing agreements built on top of a blockchain.  The proposed law states:  “Smart contracts may exist in commerce. A contract relating to a transaction may not be denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely because that contract contains a smart contract term.”  Further, the measure also includes a stipulation about who exactly owns the information secured by a blockchain.  “Notwithstanding any other law, a person that, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, uses blockchain technology to secure information that the person owns or has the right to use retains rights of ownership or use with respect to that information as before the person secured the information using blockchain technology,” the bill states.  The bill is somewhat akin to another measure put forward in Vermont that would make blockchain records admissible as evidence in court. In both cases, state law is amended to create a kind of legal backing for blockchain-based information.  Notably, Weninger’s bill is the second to emerge from Arizona’s state legislature since the start of the year.  In mid-January, state representative Paul Boyer submitted a bill that would largely prohibit the use of blockchain tech to track firearms.

The funding round for Hashed Health was led by Martin Ventures, an existing investor. Blockchain VC firm Fenbushi Capital, along with a group of private investors and relatives of the management team, also took part in the round.  In statements, Hashed Health’s backers positioned the new funding as a way for the consortium to advance its work. Charles Martin, chairman and founder of Martin Ventures, said of the round:  “The healthcare industry must be drastically reformed in order to address problems related to quality, cost and waste. Hashed Health is poised to drive innovation and collaboration to reach these goals.”  Hashed Health launched its consortium last year in a bid to stoke interest amongst US healthcare firms in the tech. It’s one of a number of initiatives focused on healthcare applications, a topic that has led interests from Capital One to the US Food and Drug Administration to test use cases.  Yet large-scale adoption isn't necessarily a given.

42399595,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjsxH,1486480820,EU Securities Watchdog: New DLT Regulations Would Be 'Premature',"Europe's chief securities regulator said today that new regulations for blockchain would be ""premature"" at this stage.  The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) published a new report this morning, outlining the results of its year-and-a-half-long research process into the tech. The agency first began soliciting comments about possible new rules in April 2015, releasing its preliminary research outcomes in June.  While leaving the door open to future regulations – pending broader adoption by the market it regulates – ESMA said that, for now, it’s sticking with a hands-off approach to the tech.  The agency said in a statement:  ""At this stage, ESMA believes that it is premature to fully appreciate the changes that the technology could bring and the regulatory response that may be needed, given that the technology is still evolving and practical applications are limited both in number and scope.""  In the meantime, the agency called on securities industry stakeholders to develop solutions around interoperability and standards. Further, ESMA indicated that, in the future, it may move to develop a regulatory framework.  ""ESMA will continue to monitor market developments around DLT to assess whether a regulatory response may be needed,"" it said.  Notably, the statement bears strong similarities to comments issued by Patrick Armstrong, a senior risk analysis officer for the watchdog, late last month during an event in Norway.  ""We believe it is premature to appreciate all the technological changes and the potential regulatory response that may be needed, as the technology is still in its infancy,"" Armstrong said at the time.

42399594,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjswI,1486478138,The Philippines Just Released New Rules for Bitcoin Exchanges,"The central bank of the Philippines has released new guidelines for bitcoin exchanges operating in the country.  The move comes months after officials for the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) signaled their intention to regulate exchanges, suggesting at the time that they would class the businesses as a form of remittance company.  Under guidelines inked on 16th January and published today, ""entities"" that offer exchange services will be required to apply for a Certificate of Registration. Exchanges will also need to register with the country’s Anti-Money Laundering Council Secretariat, the document shows, and while currently unspecified, exchanges will also be subject to ""registration and annual fee services"".  In statements, the central bank positioned the regulations from the perspective of anti-money laundering and financial stability, echoing a 2014 warning it issued about digital currencies.  The BSP said:  ""The Bangko Sentral does not intend to endorse any [virtual currency], such as bitcoin, as a currency since it is neither issued or guaranteed by a central bank nor backed by any commodity. Rather, the BSP aims to regulate [virtual currencies] when used for delivery of financial services, particularly, for payments and remittances, which have material impact on anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT), consumer protection and financial stability.""  Mirroring other regulatory approaches, domestic exchanges are now subject to annual and quarterly reporting requirements. The central bank is applying reporting penalties to exchanges.  Further, the BSP document outlines security criteria exchanges in the Philippines must follow.  ""For VC exchanges providing wallet services for holding, storing and transferring VCs, an effective cybersecurity program encompassing storage and transaction security requirements as well as sound key management practices must be established to ensure the integrity and security of VC transactions and wallets,"" the central bank said.

42379212,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nY57,1486476021,Inside MAST: The Little-Known Plan to Advance Bitcoin Smart Contracts,"Despite being the largest and longest-running blockchain, bitcoin isn't exactly known for its programming features.  In an age when new blockchain projects continually promise bigger and better (and platforms like ethereum openly court more novice coders), bitcoin has even prized its simpler, safer construction. But that's not to say that work isn't ongoing to bring more advanced functionality to the network.  If and when a certain contentious code change upgrade called SegWit is deployed (and this remains an if), protocol developers say that it could pave the way for a range of new technical improvements. This includes the long-standing Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST) upgrade, a concept packaged into an official proposal by Bitcoin Core developer Johnson Lau in early 2016.  Another new piece of cutting-edge cryptography, MAST doesn't enable new smart contracts per se, but by reducing the size of the data necessary for bitcoin scripts, it enables ""complicated redemption conditions"" that aren't currently viable partially because of space constraints.  Lau told CoinDesk:  ""MAST makes complicated smart contracts become very small in size. This reduces demand on block space and improves privacy, as you only reveal a small part of the smart contract to the public blockchain, so it's more difficult to analyze.""  On a more technical level, MAST could be described as an extension to Pay to Script Hash.  By using Merkle trees (the same data structure that stores transactions in bitcoin blocks), it enables a new way of embedding and processing scripts that offers more scalability and privacy.  It sounds technical (and perhaps like a minor change), but many bitcoin developers are excited by the potential because they believe it expands bitcoin’s ability to be used as ""programmable money"".  Smart contract confusion  Stepping back for a minute, a 'smart contract' is a term that refers to a snippet of code that enforces rules on its own, without leaning on an intermediary to interpret the rules and settle disputes when they arise.  Although the tendency is to think of smart contracts as more complex programs, every bitcoin payment uses one. Unless the sender provides the right digital signature (proving that he or she is the owner), the network won’t transfer the bitcoin.  Yet, as mentioned, that definition might sound underwhelming in the context of ethereum, the alternative blockchain applications platform that allows developers to create virtually any kind of smart contract.  Lau noted as much. ""For smart contracts to be really ‘smart’, it should allow people doing something more than simple payment,"" he said.  It's worth noting, too, that bitcoin’s scripting language previously supported more complex types of smart contracts.  However, the digital currency’s still-pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto had to rip many of them out back in 2010 when he or she realized that there were bugs that malicious actors could use to clog the network with spam. It's taken a while to build that functionality back up.  With this in mind, Lau has put together another bitcoin proposal for a bundle of new 'opcodes' (enabling new smart contracts), many of which have been brought back in a testing environment, saying these would likely be rolled out in tandem with MAST.  He added that his proposal could further reinstate some that were torn out seven years ago.  Although, once the time comes, Lau noted that he doesn’t expect that all of the opcodes proposed in the BIP (bitcoin improvement proposal) to be accepted. ""Even only a few (eg OP_CAT or OP_XOR) would enable things that are not possible today,"" he said.  And, again, these would be bundled with MAST.  New bitcoin uses  There are also practical uses for these features, and Lau pointed to a couple of use cases for MAST combined with the new opcodes.  One is a betting scheme ""without any trust needed"", he said. His example implementation uses the proposed opcodes OP_XOR and OP_RSHIFT, but he noted that there are other script combinations called 'covenants' that accomplish the same thing.  These restrict how users can use funds, and are“frequently requested, according to Lau"".  Blockstream unveiled last year that it has been experimenting with covenants on a test sidechain – a blockchain with a different rule system that is pegged to bitcoin.  The idea is to give users more control over their bitcoin, even if it’s stolen. Say you want to send your bitcoin to an exchange, but you’re worried about the exchange losing funds, as happened with Mt Gox.  Using a construction called a 'vault', perhaps the best-known example of a covenant, users can send their bitcoin to new address along with a certain type of script. Effectively, that script has the power to suck your bitcoin back in the case of a Mt Gox-style hack.  This construction would require the new opcodes OP_CAT and OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK.  It’s worth noting, though, that some developers are skeptical that vaults would work, and think that the protecting funds would be better achieved by other means.  That said, there are many types of covenants. Co-founder of MIT Digital Currency Initiative Jeremy Rubin described a variety of other examples in a presentation at the Stanford blockchain security conference last week.  And, there are other miscellaneous ideas of how MAST might be used (which seem to pop up randomly and often when chatting with bitcoin developers).  Lightning Labs engineer Olaoluwa Osuntokun, who also presented at Stanford, mentioned that MAST could even improve the Lightning Network.  This top-layer network, aimed to boost bitcoin capacity, needs someone to monitor the channel used to connect parties in the transaction in the case one tries to cheat. MAST could help with outsourcing this need to a third party, as it reduces the storage space required to do so.  Small steps  Beyond MAST and the opcodes bundled with it, there are other smart contract ideas floating around.  At least two groups are working on opcodes that would alter bitcoin to add sidechains functionality, mentioned earlier. However, like many other features, SegWit would make it easier, because it rolls out a new way of making big consensus changes.  Lightning Network co-creator Joseph Poon mentioned in a recent presentation that his proposed implementation will use an interesting system of smart contracts emerging from a few opcodes that are in bitcoin already.  As far as MAST, R&D is ongoing. In conversation with CoinDesk, Rubin noted that he’s been thinking through a new, potentially better way of implementing the same thing. But, for the time being, the contentious code change SegWit seems to be the main obstacle.  Yet, even if the consensus change isn’t activated in the next eight months, Lau noted that there is another ""less elegant"" way of bypassing the transaction malleability problem and thus adding support for MAST – a move that could help place bitcoin back in the broader smart contracts conversation.

42379223,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nYHh,1486474230,Bitcoin's Price is Back Within $100 of its 2017 High,"The price of bitcoin keeps creeping higher.  Bolstered by buoyed sentiment (and the increasing unlikelihood that China’s central bank will again step in and correct the market), bitcoin breached $1,050 at 13:00 UTC amid a near-3% increase for the day so far.  The total marked the highest point observed on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) since 6th January, just a day after the price dropped nearly $200 within hours of hovering near all-time highs set in late 2013 (a move that was widely attributed to the widespread use of market leverage).  The price movements come amid an uptick in volume that followed a substantial decline in volume at major exchanges.  Data from Bitcoinity shows the market is up slightly since three major China-based exchanges to begin imposing fees on both sides of bitcoin trades, a market change that is still being widely felt.  Yet, there is still some tepid sentiment in the market, as put forward by China-based OTC trader Zhou Shouji.  He maintains that ""no one knows"" if further actions will be taken, though he indicated some may be preparing for this scenario.  Shouji suggested China-based traders see the increasing price as a potential red flag for domestic regulators, even while others positioned it as a more natural recovery.

42379221,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7nYFB,1486470311,South Africa's Financial Power Players Are Going All-In on Blockchain,"South Africa's central bank, its central securities depository (CSD) and several of its largest banks came together yesterday to chart a course toward large-scale blockchain implementation.  Held in Johannesburg, South Africa, the meeting saw members of the blockchain working group elect a chairman, secretariat and set strategic objectives for the year ahead. Collectively, the participants in the working group comprise nearly every participant necessary to build and implement real blockchain products.  Yet, even more remarkable is the outlook of some of the participants.  Monica Singer, CEO of Strate, South Africa's CSD, for example, described the group's effort on blockchain as one that isn’t just about finding a new revenue streams – but evolving to survive.  As more and more services move to distributed, shared ledgers, she believes central authorities like her own will have no choice but to meet with their users and explore new possibilities.  Singer told CoinDesk:  ""My mission is to ensure that Strate can continue operating forever. But it will have to change its role. It's like, if you’re a taxi operator you better embrace Uber because I don’t know how long you’re going to operate as a taxi.""  Hosted by Strate's experimental financial technology division, Fractal, the working group was jointly created by the CSD and the country's 'Big Four' banks: FirstRand Group, Standard Bank, Absa/Barclays Africa and Nedbank.  Sitting in as observers to the working group are the South African Reserve Bank and the Financial Services Board, both of which help regulate the nation's post-trade services.  Overall, South Africa’s Blockchain Working Group is broken down into three other 'streams', also including education, use-case development and technical construction.  ""At the end of the day, the blockchain is about consensus,"" Singer said. ""So you have to work with everybody. So that’s what we did.""  Vetting use cases  To help identify the future role Strate might play, the CSD – which conducts on average 350,000 trades per day – is now collaborating with other working group members to determine a course forward on blockchain.  In addition to helping formally elect leadership to the group, the chairman of its technical 'stream', Strate innovation architect Johan Pretorius, broke down the the project’s current work and future plans.  Pretorius started work on the project last year by co-developing a proof-of-concept using the ethereum blockchain to build a faster, more transparent way to issue syndicated loans.  Now, Pretorius has segmented the technical stream into four teams working with Chain, Hyperledger, Corda and the soon-to-be launched Enterprise Ethereum.  Upon completion, Pretorius plans for the team to build a common user interface through which projects will be accessed, gauged via standardized tests and stored in a repository that will be ""selectively visible to the external world"".  To further assist in the identification of use cases, Pretorius said additional high-tech vetting tools could be implemented using other Strate services.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We might employ our artificial intelligence technologies to create a blockchain advisory service that will assist the community to assess whether or not a use case is suited for a blockchain solution and if so, which tech is most suitable.""  Chocolate and other assets  One reason for the rapid rate of progress of South Africa’s financial institutions is its size – not too small to reach critical mass, not too big to get organized – according to another member of the blockchain working group.  The head of Rand Merchant Bank's blockchain initiative, Farzam Ehsani, told CoinDesk that, with only six major banks in South Africa, consensus is easier to achieve.  As part of that orderly transition to blockchain, Ehsani, who was yesterday elected chair of the working group, said the group is formalizing who is responsible for what, and what happens if things go wrong.  Already, Rand has developed an ethereum-powered prototype for selling employees chocolate and other snacks at its 'tuck shop', a small convenience store.  But with the ""the unity in the room"" at the working group meetings, Ehsani suggested the chocolates could be easily substituted for other assets, with the tuck shop equating to the central bank.  ""If you actually take this tuck shop away,"" said Ehsani, ""and don’t think about it as a tuck shop, think about it as an issuing institution, the chocolates now are no longer chocolates, but they’re bonds, equities, they’re whatever you want them to be – they’re assets.""  'Magic' technology  While faster transactions times are certainly important to Singer, who in 1998 helped implement Strate’s post-trade services, the immutable, transparent services of a distributed ledger appeal to her for another reason.  In addition to acknowledging that Strate – the ""mother of all intermediaries"" as she called the company – will have to evolve to survive, she says she’d be happy to disintermediate another notable service as well.  From the time she helped launch the company almost 20 years ago, Singer said she wanted to bring South Africa faster transaction times without Swift, the inter-bank payments network also experimenting with blockchain and distributed ledgers.  ""But I was told that I couldn’t use anything but Swift because the Internet was not reliable,"" she said.  Singer went on:  ""Now, I’ve learned, that this incredible magician, Satoshi Nakamoto, got really upset with the financial crisis, like I did, and invented a method that said we don’t need intermediaries, because the intermediaries didn’t deliver the certainty that we need for financial markets, because look at the mess that we’re in.""  Building revenue  But as Strate and other intermediaries like the DTCC in the US work to better understand what future services they might be able to provide, Singer said finding new ways to generate revenue will be crucial.  For Strate, that means further development of its ethereum-based proxy-voting tool, developed last year.  Similar to the work being done by financial services firm Broadridge (which last year invested an industry-leading $95m to make it easier to make corporate voting decisions), Strate wants to make it easier to vote transparently, anywhere.  Already, Strate has gained interest in the idea. In August, the firm signed a letter of intent with Russia’s National Settlement Depository to help develop the offering.  While Strate has yet to work out revenue forecasts for the service, Singer thinks blockchain-based proxy-voting might eventually help off-set losses resulting from her company’s changing role as middleman – or middle woman, as the case may be.  Not only might the increased transparency make it more difficult to let others vote in one's place, it could help make voting more mobile – a particularly valuable service in some circumstances.  Singer concluded:  ""What we’re doing is we’re taking the proof-of-concept that we have, which is amazing, you can do it with your phone, you can even vote when you’re sitting on the toilet, because it doesn’t matter, you don’t have to attend the meeting.""
