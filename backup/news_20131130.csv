42376736,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cp65,1385855913,"Roger Ver, 'Bitcoin Jesus', Makes Largest Ever Bitcoin Donation of $1 Million","Globetrotting bitcoin entrepreneur Roger Ver just made the largest ever charitable bitcoin donation — a million dollars — after ‘losing’ a bet he made with the world about its rise.  The CEO of MemoryDealers and angel investor actually made an initial bet of $10,000 (the value of 1,000 BTC at the time) but recent events have pushed the dollar value into seven figures, setting the record.  “A little over two years ago I made a bet for $10,000 that bitcoin would outperform gold, silver, the US stock market and the US dollar by more than one hundred times over the next two years,” he posted in a video message on YouTube.  “I'm here today to say that I was wrong, In reality it took about two years and two months for bitcoin to outperform everything else by more than a hundred times. Over that time, gold and silver are down, the stock market is up about 45 per cent, but Bitcoin is up more than 15,000 per cent, or more than three hundred times everything else.”  Despite the prediction being off by only a couple of months, Ver decided to obey the letter of the original bet on principle and donate the 1,000 BTC to the Foundation for Economic Education (FEE), “the organization that published the books and articles that allowed me to understand just how important Bitcoin would become.”  His wager would have sounded crazy to an outsider in late 2011. Even though the bet was with the world in general and not any one (unlucky) individual, Ver said no one offered to bet against him.  “One person offered to take the other side after about 85% of the time had already elapsed though,” he said.  That someone was still prepared to take the other side as recently as that is a mark of how much the scenery has changed in the past few months.  In his video, Ver went on to point out the tens of millions of dollars in investment that has flowed to businesses like BitPay, Coinbase and Blockchain.info as they expand into countries around the world. There are now millions of individual bitcoin users who can now use their digital currency for over 70,000 stores on Shopify, or organize their own trades via LocalBitcoins.com.  Ver is one of a fast-growing number of professionals and others whose full-time employment is now based on bitcoin, as it continues to captivate even the non-technology-minded in media, government and the general public.  [post-quote]  A Silicon Valley native, Ver is known in bitcoin circles as 'The Bitcoin Jesus' for his generous and evangelizing ways with digital currency. He started MemoryDealers at the age of 19 and first encountered bitcoin while listening to Free Talk Live. With a clear vision of what bitcoin would become he built it into his business immediately, even putting up a large roadside billboard in June 2011 when bitcoin was largely unknown to the mainstream world.  FEE itself is an organization founded in 1946 to promote free market economics, limited government and private property rights. Said to be very pleased with the donation, they are now looking for the best way to securely store $1 million worth of bitcoins.  Choosing them as the recipient of his million-dollar donation was no casual decision for Ver, who is well-known for his matching values and has studied economics and moral philosophy from a young age.  He stood as a candidate for the Libertarian Party in 2000 for the California State Assembly, promising not to accept a salary if elected. He became even more fervently anti-authoritarian after his passionate debate comments from the campaign saw his business interests aggressively investigated and himself arrested, and he was even eventually imprisoned for 10 months in a federal prison after signing a plea bargain.  Though he still travels to the US and flies regularly to visit bitcoin businesses and conferences around the world, Ver now calls Japan his home and runs his business operations from there. He sees bitcoin as a vital tool for removing government control over money and economic activity.  “I will proudly continue to promote bitcoin full time because I see it as the best chance the world has ever seen at creating a more peaceful society in which all human interactions are voluntary, and outside groups of people calling themselves the state are no longer able to violently interject themselves into the affairs of others,” the video message concluded.

42376753,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cpRT,1385808025,US Regulators: the World's Bitcoin Police?,"It's clear that some of the top cops in the United States aspire to regulate virtual currencies on a global scale.  A series of meetings took place last week in response to the criminal activities lawmakers have witnessed using distributed money such as bitcoin.  What does this mean for those starting bitcoin-based businesses in the US? And what impact will this have on virtual currencies in the global economy?  Three simple steps?  Jennifer Shasky Calvery is the US director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (commonly known as FinCEN). During the Senate Committee Meeting 'Beyond Silk Road: Potential Risks, Threats, and Promises of Virtual Currencies' on 18th November, Calvery implored virtual currency exchanges and administrators to do three things:  Register with FinCEN.  Put in place Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protections.  Maintain their records.  It was implicit in Calvery's remarks that companies who failed to comply with these steps could be considered malicious actors.  From FinCEN's perspective, that's pretty black and white - indicating that any foreign company might have something to hide, because registering with FinCEN is as simple as that.  But it's not as simple as that, as there is another money transmitter component at state level: a byzantine system that Bitcoin Foundation's General Counsel Patrick Murck referred to as a ""regime"".  Any startup operating a bitcoin business must set up a money transmitter business in each jurisdiction, a unique process for each of the USA's 50 state governments.  China is eating the USA's lunch  A good portion of bitcoin's growth can be attributed to China's lax, or rather, non-existant policies regarding it. While the country's Communist Party limits the use of foreign sites like Facebook, it welcomes a homegrown bitcoin economy.  It's entirely possible that China's lack of enforcement, despite the risks, will allow bitcoin to prosper further.  “Today, bitcoin is in its infancy. It’s much like the internet of the early 1990s,” says Tony Gallipi, CEO of BitPay, at the Senate Banking Committee dubbed 'The Present and Future Impact of Virtual Currency'.  “If America is the leader in bitcoin technology, America will create more jobs, and more exports,” he added.  “China is getting very aggressive in the open market [...] if we want America to remain a leader in technology and in bitcoin, you have to look at the exchanges, because that is where all the liquidity is.” And he's right. There isn't an American bitcoin exchange in the top five market rankings. In fact, there isn't even one in the top ten, according to Bitcoincharts market data.  The USA's Grasp  Edward Lowery is the head of the Criminal Investigative Division for the US Secret Service and the US Department of Homeland Security. He spoke at the hearing on 18th November which focused on criminal organisations like Silk Road.  He noted that US authorities are “very collaborative with [...] foreign partners”.  Although libertarians and cyberpunks revel in the idea of internet anonymity, so does the federal government - especially as a means of catching cyber-criminals. It seems law enforcement agencies may play the anonymous card to fight organised crime.  According to Lowery's statements, authorities are using two primary tactics to fight virtual currency crime. ""Infiltration is the best investigative tactic,"" he remarked at the committee meeting.  What next?  “I’m reluctant to call it a currency” said Steven T. Walther, a member of the Federal Election Commission (FEC). The FEC is considering whether to define bitcoin as money or a ""methodology"".  Calling it a methodology is interesting. A methodology is, by definition, simply a method. Bitcoin is a method by which to do a number of things: make payments, invest and move money - often with low fees and alacrity.  However, bitcoin can also be used to launder money, buy illegal goods and steal from unsuspecting people.  The US will likely have a role in policing bitcoin globally, but hopefully not to the point where it would stifle any potentially innovative properties that could revolutionise our global baking system.

42376737,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6cp9r,1385771685,British Island Wants to Make Physical Bitcoins with UK Royal Mint Deal,"A tiny island in the English Channel, Alderney, wants to mint physical bitcoins as part of a larger campaign to become one of the world’s first financial services centers devoted to digital currency.  The Financial Times reported that Alderney, just three miles long with a population of 1,900, wants to become known as an international center for bitcoin transactions. Intended to be fully compliant with anti money-laundering and other financial regulations, it would offer merchant payment services, exchanges, and a bitcoin storage vault of some kind.  The physical bitcoins, like other such tokens, would be collectors’ items rather than circulated, and would likely have a gold content (apparently around £500 worth) to further their appeal and allow them to retain value should bitcoin’s price crash. They would also serve as promotional tokens for the more ‘serious’ bitcoin payment and exchange services.  Alderney’s coins would hopefully be minted in a collaboration with the UK’s Royal Mint as part of a commemorative collection. Rather than having a private key sealed inside, like the popular Casascius physical bitcoins and their contemporaries, the Alderney bitcoins would be exchangeable for the more useful digital kind by its holder paying a visit to the island. They would not be official legal tender otherwise.  Production would be overseen by an independent company, who would also take the hit if bitcoin’s value vanished. The same company would also hold the coins’ keys in an escrow service. If the deal goes ahead, The Royal Mint would handle orders and take some of the money from sales.  With current bitcoin values hovering around $1,100 on CoinDesk’s BPI (over $1,200 on Mt. Gox) and seeming to jump higher with each passing day, more daring segments of the financial world are sensing an opportunity to create a whole new industry. The high values, including not only bitcoin’s but those of other digital currencies as well, are wrenching the concept out of the hands of tech-savvy entrepreneurs and delivering it to people more accustomed to billion-dollar movements.  Bitcoin and digital currencies, despite occasional murmurings and investigations by authorities, still have no legal recognition as currencies in any major jurisdiction. No legislation has been tabled specifically for digital currencies, though exchanges and payment processors generally fall under the same know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations as other ‘money transmitters’.  The Channel Islands, just off the coast of France, are ‘Crown Dependencies’ and not officially part of the UK. This special legal status has traditionally made them a hub for offshore financial services, with most of the activity happening on larger Guernsey and Jersey.  Alderney falls under the jurisdiction of the Bailiwick of Guernsey but has been looking for ways to gain more financial independence from its neighbors. The island has long produced stamps and minted its own coins, called the Alderney pound, pegged 1:1 to UK pound sterling. The coins are produced in denominations of £1, £2 and £5 in ordinary cupro-nickel as well as gold and silver versions, and are also aimed primarily at collectors.  Focusing on bitcoin would further differentiate Alderney’s offshore services from those of Guernsey and Jersey. Alderney’s government also passed legislation in May 2000 to establish the island as a center for online gambling, altering it in 2005 to enable gambling operators advertising in the UK itself. More recently, Alderney has also sought to establish a renewable energy (mostly wind farming) industry.  The islands’ appeal to offshore financial services clients lies mainly with their proximity to Europe and status outside UK/EU jurisdiction, advanced telecommunications infrastructure, English language, and retention of British legal tradition and culture.  Though it has a reciprocal tax agreement with the UK and Jersey, Alderney itself has no Value Added Tax, no capital or inheritance taxes, no tax on trusts whose beneficiaries live outside the island, and no tax for exempt companies doing business outside the Channel Islands.
