42430093,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRAjh,1546696803,2018: When Privacy and Decentralization Collided,"Guy Zyskind is the CEO and co-founder of Enigma, a secure computation protocol that integrates with blockchains.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  In 2018, two major long-term trends finally collided in a very public fashion.  The first trend was the over-centralization of online platforms. For years, Facebook, Google and others accumulated power and influence by centralizing user behavior. Products given to users “for free” created closed systems and echo chambers designed to keep users inside siloed ecosystems. In turn, platforms repackaged these captured users into lucrative advertising products, creating an online oligopoly.  The second trend was the erosion of data privacy. A complete lack of transparency around how data was used, shared and protected by platforms and institutions led to some dramatic revelations. First, Cambridge Analytica whistleblowers exposed how Facebook data was misused to target individuals during political campaigns. The rest of the year was filled with news stories of massive data breaches, hacking coverups and yes, even more terrifying Facebook revelations.  So why did everything explode in 2018? The truth is that these trends have been converging for a very long time. Many of the most horrifying news items of 2018 concerned vulnerabilities that have existed for years. The only thing different about this year is that we finally started to notice. And maybe that’s the scariest thing of all.  No easy fix  It’s easy to see how centralization and data privacy are linked. Without the appropriate oversight, monopolistic platforms are not held accountable for their use of our data – or how it is protected. Also, keeping data in centralized databases under a single entity’s control creates a juicy target for opportunistic hackers who could leak, exploit, or ransom the data.  What’s not easy, however, is creating decentralized alternatives that adequately address the issue of data privacy. There were countless articles written over the past year extolling the virtues of blockchain and how it could disrupt Facebook’s business forever by enabling decentralized social platforms. Most of these articles, however, contained a fundamental misunderstanding of how blockchain worked or overlooked its existing limitations (like scalability and privacy). As a result, they did not foresee how challenging addressing this problem would actually be.  This is where the third major trend of 2018 comes in: the (over)correction of the blockchain hype cycle.  Enthusiastic speculation around the potential of blockchain exploded to unsustainable levels in 2017 and carried over into this year. Magazine covers and thought leaders promoted blockchain as a potential cure-all. Nearly any problem could be solved by “throwing a blockchain at it,” with WIRED famously categorizing 187 things the blockchain is supposed to fix. But as market prices for cryptoassets began to implode, this list narrowed dramatically over the course of 2018, culminating with more proclamations from thought leaders that “blockchain is useless.”  While there may be no end in sight for the first two trends – monopolistic platforms still lack oversight and transparency, and the worst breaches of data privacy are likely yet to come – there are signs the blockchain hype cycle has stabilized. Expectations are beginning to align with reality – and real solutions are being proposed.  Decentralized solutions for data privacy  We published an article on the Enigma blog back in March (around the time of the original Cambridge Analytica story) about how blockchain alone could not fix Facebook. As we wrote at the time:  “While blockchain is great for correctness and transparency, it fails in privacy. Today, as blockchain is applied to the financial system, we are able to see all transactions that have ever taken place. In a future where we have decentralized social networks, we will see all likes, posts, and connections. In other words, blockchains alone cannot give people control over their own data.”  This statement was our attempt to take a measured approach to the problems of over-centralization and data privacy. Rather than rejecting the utility of blockchain, we hoped that people would see blockchain for what it was good at being – a decentralized verification layer, not a complete platform. Fortunately, many builders and leaders in the space have embraced this healthy perspective, including Vitalik Buterin and the Web3 Foundationhttps://github.com/w3f/Web3-wiki/wiki.  We expect 2019 to bring continued focus on the non-blockchain layers of the tech stack for the decentralized web. These include oracles, decentralized storage, state channels – but perhaps most importantly – privacy-preserving computation. This allows encrypted data to be computed by nodes in a decentralized network – all without revealing the data to the nodes themselves.  Secure computation  has been a field of study since the 1980s, long before Satoshi proposed bitcoin. It is often considered the “holy grail” of computer science – and with recent advancements, we are finally beginning to realize some of the potentials of secure computation.  When combined with other decentralized technologies such as blockchain, we can create foundational platforms for unstoppable applications that preserve the privacy of their users. The dream of dapps has always been to put the needs and interests of users first – protecting their data and identities while preventing censorship. Decentralized privacy solutions are the missing piece for realizing this dream.  In 2019, we can expect to see more and more projects in the blockchain space embracing privacy solutions, including Ethereum itself.  There are many technologies to explore, such as zero-knowledge proofs and zk-snarks/starks, trusted execution environments, secure multi-party computation and fully homomorphic encryption. Understanding any one of them is challenging, and the development work supporting these technologies is still in its earliest stages. However, protocols based on these privacy technologies have as much potential to reshape the world as blockchain itself – if not substantially more so.  What now?  In 2018, the conversation around the potential of blockchains turned rapidly from “what can’t they do?” to “what can they do?” Pundits began to declare blockchains a solution in search of a problem. But this ignores the very real problems all around us, from government censorship to broken financial systems to the frequent violation of data privacy and security.  In 2019, we believe the conversation will turn again as people begin to realize the deep relationship between these problems and decentralized solutions. Specifically, we expect people to realize that the greatest risks to data privacy have always come from centralized platforms and architectures – and that this is by design, not by accident. We also expect people to understand the limitations of blockchain as a privacy solution – again by design. The trends have already coincided. It’s up to all of us to help draw the connections.  Our greatest priority in 2019, beyond building, must be education and advocacy. Importantly, this effort cannot just be limited to blockchain technology. We must also focus on other decentralized technologies and the problems they can help solve, such as censorship and data privacy. In that last area, there are already many incredible organizations doing great work on education and advocacy, including the Tor Project and EFF.  We want and need decentralized technologies to be globally implemented and have global relevance. To do this, we must all embrace purposes beyond speculation.  Our purpose is privacy. What’s yours?

42430091,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRAhh,1546687858,The False Promise Blockchains Will Revolutionize Real-World Assets,"Farzam Ehsani is co-founder and CEO of VALR.com, a digital asset trading platform.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  In 2018, as cryptocurrency prices declined, the corporate-blockchain-marketing machine continued to hum unabated. Corporates continued to issue press releases about their “world-first” blockchain implementations that were going to solve the world’s greatest challenges.  Here’s the thing. If you lived at the time of Alexander Graham Bell and heard about a new invention that promised to radically transform communication, you would be forgiven for thinking that the telephone may have been the solution to your communication problems in marriage. While the telephone did indeed change the face of communication globally, it did nothing to address marital communication problems.  Such is the state of the blockchain promise today: It’s a powerful tool, but probably not for what you think.  We’ve been told that blockchain technology will get rid of the need for trust in the world. We won’t have to trust corrupt governments, greedy corporations or rigged electoral systems. Everything from deeds offices to supply chains to voting systems to identity will be revolutionized, ensuring we never have to trust another untrustworthy human being, institution or government ever again.  This is a pipe dream that is unsubstantiated and misleading.  A digital revolution  Blockchain technology is powerful, but its domain is the digital world, not the physical one.  More specifically, blockchains reduce the need for trusted intermediaries for digitally-native assets that are born, live and potentially die exclusively on a blockchain. Cryptocurrencies are a good example. Their existence and ownership is defined by entries on a blockchain which serve as the source of truth for these digitally-native assets.  No reconciliations with other databases nor the physical world is needed. Whatever the blockchain says is truth for these digital assets.  But for assets in the physical world, this is not the case. Let’s take property as an example. There are several problems with using blockchain technology for this use case. A feature of blockchain technology is the emergence of the digital bearer instrument. This means that if you are in possession of a private key, you are the owner of the asset at the corresponding public address on a particular blockchain and are entitled to spend or transfer the asset as you please.  This also means that if you lose the private key, you have lost ownership of the asset.  This is all part of the “censorship resistance” property of blockchains that will supposedly eliminate trust in untrustworthy people or institutions.  Don't forget databases  So, if a country did decide to move all properties onto a blockchain (let’s leave aside the question of which blockchain would be used, who would run the nodes, what the consensus algorithm would be, and who would maintain and upgrade the software/protocol as required), what would happen if you lost the private key to your home?  Would this somehow mean you no longer owned it and that you could no longer sell it?  Surely there would have to be a process for you to reclaim your “lost” home. And if this process involved appealing to a central authority to reinstate your rightful claim to your home, then what would be the point of a supposedly immutable database that could be overridden by a central authority?  Furthermore, if a central authority could reinstate your claim to your home, that would certainly open up the possibility of a corrupt official “reinstating” your home to someone else.  What of the scenario where squatters take possession of your land? Holding the private key won’t magically evict them from the land and enforce property rights that have become a hallmark of well-functioning economies. You’ll need to either take matters into your own hands to persuade or coerce the squatters to leave your land, or you’ll have to appeal to an executive force that you trust to enforce your rights to the land.  Once again, if you need to trust a government to enforce your rights, then surely you should be able to trust them to run a database? On the topic of hard forks, what happens to physical property that is represented on a blockchain when a hard fork occurs? There are now two tokens on two separate chains representing a single property in the real world.  This would potentially lead to conflict, unless of course a central authority decides how to resolve such a situation, which renders a decentralized blockchain redundant. And if a hard fork can’t occur because the blockchain is run by a central authority on a distributed ledger, then a regular database would suffice.  It would be cheaper and more efficient to run. A blockchain wouldn’t be required.  Several countries over the last few years such as Georgia, Ghana, Honduras, Sweden and others have made announcements about how they intend to use blockchain technology to manage their land registries. While some of these projects are still in “research” or “testing” phases, others have issued public comments that they have “stalled.""  A clearer focus  We should expect more to head in this direction in 2019. Land registries are just one example of the false promise that blockchain technology will revolutionize industries based in the physical world.  The fact is that we will never be able to completely get rid of the reconciliation between the physical and digital worlds (at least given current and foreseeable technologies).  We live in a physical world and when digital tokens that represent physical assets (e.g., art pieces, bananas, cars, diamonds, houses, etc.) are issued on a blockchain, there is a need to verify that these digital tokens are in fact backed by the physical assets they claim to represent. It is, however, impractical and economically inefficient for each person to verify this for him or herself. The need for verification reintroduces the need for a trusted intermediary. Blockchains or distributed ledgers won’t get rid of this trust.  Today everyone knows what communication problems a telephone solves and which ones it doesn’t.  Let’s hope it’s not much longer before the world understands what problems a blockchain solves and which ones it doesn’t.

42430084,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMRARh,1546684237,"Bitcoin Payments Aren't Dead, They've Just Gone Niche","When Frank and Nikki McKeever founded their small art retailer in Florida in 2012, they never could have imagined that cryptocurrency would become an integral part of their business.  In September 2017 – a period of surging cryptocurrency prices and publicity – the Lynx Art Collection began offering crypto-themed artworks with litecoin, monero, ether, and bitcoin payment options. Yet even when market prices dipped, their gallery sales continued climbing.  “The bear market didn't really affect our sales throughout the majority of 2018,” Frank McKeever said.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the Lynx Art Collection had received more than 500 crypto payments for various prints and artworks by December 2018, making up roughly 75 percent of its annual sales.  “The crypto category has just exploded for us,” McKeever told CoinDesk, adding that he enjoys the grassroots marketing style of engaging with crypto fans on social media. “We've sold over 1,000 pieces of crypto artwork in 2018.”  The McKeevers' gallery is just one example of how merchant adoption of bitcoin payments can still be viable for niche businesses that actively engage with the community. According to the bitcoin payment processor BitPay, the average value of the cryptocurrency payments it processed in 2018 was $678.77 – nearly double its $338.53 average retail payment value in 2017.  In short, the data indicates that crypto users are shopping less, but they’re spending more when they do.  Although both BitPay and Purse CEO Andrew Lee, head of a peer-to-peer marketplace that matches Amazon shoppers with bitcoin spenders, declined to specify the overall volume facilitated in 2018, internal data showed Purse traction exceeded previous records since mid-2017 and remained stable throughout most of 2018, regardless of price fluctuations.  According to Lee, there needs to be an incentive that inspires people to spend bitcoin instead of fiat currencies like dollars. That incentive can come in the form of a discount, – such as the 15 percent reduction Purse shoppers often save – or a direct relationships with sellers and creators.  Such is the case with Scottish painter Trevor Jones, one of the artists selling prints for bitcoin through Lynx Art Collection. He told CoinDesk that painting crypto-themed portraits changed his career by helping him find an audience that loves the way his paintings include augmented reality features.  “A lot of doors have opened up, with having future exhibitions,” he said, adding that some of those 2019 exhibitions will take place at tech company offices.  After a decade of working as a professional artist, Jones now sells paintings worth up to $13,000 to cryptocurrency fans he meets through Twitter.  “My previous sales were mainly through commercial galleries. Being able to sell quite expensive artwork to someone I’ve never met before is spectacular,” Jones said.  Creative storage  As a veteran crypto entrepreneur, Purse’s Lee noticed what many niche newcomers are just now discovering: “If you’re paid in bitcoin you are more likely to save a lot of it,” as he put it.  McKeever said his retailer pays the artists for crypto-themed prints directly in cryptocurrency, and holds roughly a quarter of the gallery’s profits from those sales in either bitcoin or ether – and that’s in spite of the broader market downturn seen in recent months.  “We are feeling the bear market along with everyone else right now,” McKeever said, adding that overall it’s still worthwhile because crypto payment options boosted sales by 40 percent in categories like space and science-themed prints.  Crypto fans proved to be loyal customers, even when the markets fluctuate.  Highlighting this point, in 2018 most buyers who contacted Jones directly also paid for crypto-themed paintings with bitcoin, ether, or monero, which Jones saved in bitcoin as a long-term investment.  Then, in December, inspired by conversations about the long-term custody needs of both artists and buyers, the McKeevers launched a series of holographic paper wallets.  Cryptocurrency users can store digital loot using passwords, called keys, generated with free websites like BitAddress.org. Within 24 hours, half of the 750 holographic wallets were already sold out.  Beyond the novelty of adding products based on audience interests, managing their own bitcoin wallets offers the Mckeevers a convenient way to pay European artists like Jones.  “It [bitcoin] is a quick, seamless way to transfer money over to me without anyone else taking commissions,” Jones said.
