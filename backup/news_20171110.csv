15990367,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/heres-bitcoin-privacy-sucks-can-drastically-improved,1510348696,Here's Why Bitcoin Privacy Sucks and How It Can Be Drastically Improved,"One of the first things people think they learn about Bitcoin is that it is some sort of system for completely anonymous payments on the Internet; however, the reality is that all transactions are logged on a public ledger for the whole world to see. Having said that, researchers have made strides in improving Bitcoin privacy. One of the most widely-known Bitcoin privacy tools is CoinJoin, which is a way of mixing transactions together with other users on the network. But this method of achieving better privacy doesn’t actually work that well. As Saarland University’s Tim Ruffing put it at the recent Scaling Bitcoin workshop at Stanford, “I can tell you why mixing actually sucks.” During one part of his presentation, Ruffing covered the three key reasons as to why current mixing techniques are problematic, in addition to a workable solution to these issues. All Participants Don’t Have the Same Amount of Bitcoin According to Ruffing, the first major problem with bitcoin mixing is that current solutions assume all participants in the mix have the same amount of bitcoins. Ruffing provided an example where one user, Bob, is attempting to mix 1.2 bitcoins with two other users who both have 1 bitcoin each to mix. Since Bob has a different amount of coins than the other two users (Alice and Carol) it’s extremely easy to figure out where his bitcoins ended up by taking a quick glance at the blockchain. His 1.2 bitcoin input is obviously attached to the 1.2 bitcoin output. Ruffing pointed out that change addresses are sometimes used in an attempt to get around this issue. For example, Bob could mix 1 bitcoin and then send 0.2 bitcoins back to himself as change. Unfortunately, this setup also doesn’t really work. “The problem with that is now Bob has 0.2 bitcoins that are not anonymized, and he doesn’t know what to do with it because he can’t spend it because it’s still linked to his identity,” explained Ruffing. “Maybe he could do a new CoinJoin, but then probably he would be left with another change address, so it doesn’t really solve the problem.” Issues with Spending While Mixing According to Ruffing, more problems pop up if Bob attempts to pay someone else and mix his coins in the same transaction. “In the end, you don’t only want to get privacy for your money; you want to spend it,” said Ruffing. Due to the way in which P2P CoinJoins are coordinated, Bob is effectively forced to do two transactions — first a mix and then a send — if he wants to spend his bitcoins in a manner that won’t leak sensitive transaction data via a potential attack vector. This increases Bob’s transaction costs. “Even that is not great because now Bob has two weird change addresses,” added Ruffing. Lost Privacy Via Combined Change Addresses One final issue pointed out by Ruffing during his talk is that privacy can be broken if Bob spends two outputs from separate change addresses that came from the same original mix together. “If he now, for some reason, has the idea to use these two change addresses together, it actually breaks privacy again,” said Ruffing. “It even breaks the privacy of the past transactions.” What is the Solution? Near the end of his talk, Ruffing explained that the root of all evil in these issues with bitcoin mixing is the fact that the values involved in the transactions are public. If the transaction values were not public, an observer would learn much less from blockchain analysis. A solution to this problem has been proposed in the past, and it’s known as Confidential Transactions. Ruffing uses Confidential Transactions in his and Purdue University’s Pedro Moreno-Sanchez’s solution for better on-chain privacy in Bitcoin, which is known as ValueShuffle (PDF). With this proposal, Confidential Transactions is combined with a P2P mixing protocol to mask the amounts and participants involved in on-chain Bitcoin transactions.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | WALLET,,0,0,Crypto Daily,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/heres-bitcoin-privacy-sucks-can-drastically-improved,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/15990367.jpeg

A summary report published earlier this week offers details on the group, formed in September by the Commercial Customs Operations Advisory Committee (COAC). The body, according to the CBP's website, advises the Secretaries of the U.S. Treasury and the Department of Homeland Security on the commercial operations of the CBP.  Though the working group is focused on emerging technologies in general, the report suggests that blockchain will be a major focus of research moving forward.  Thus far, the advisory panel has identified a number of possible use cases for the technology, with the report explaining:  ""The group came up with 14 proposed use cases. They included ideas such as capturing and keeping track of partnering government agencies licenses, permits, certificate of origin reporting and free trade agreement product qualifications, carnets and bonded movement tracking.""  The paper indicates that group is now looking into those use cases and determining how they might be deployed using blockchain technology.  At this time, it's unclear whether the CBP advisory group's work will translate into tangible applications at the agency. That said, recent work within a number of U.S. departments points to the proactive stance on the part of some officials, so it remains to be seen if – and how – the CBP embraces blockchain.

42380051,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LmUt,1510329679,'2x' Boost? Bitcoin Cash Closes on Record High,"Bitcoin cash is on fire today.  As per CoinMarketCap data, the bitcoin cash-U.S. dollar (BCH/USD) exchange rate rose to a three-month high of $872.24 at 11:29 UTC. The cryptocurrency's record all-time high of $920 was set on Aug. 19.  As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $800, and has climbed 27 percent over the last 24 hours. On a monthly basis, BCH is now up a staggering 150 percent.  The gains come amid rising speculation that the surprise cancellation of the Segwit2x hard fork this week means bitcoin may become more of ""store of value"" than a specialized protocol for day-to-day payments.  So far, the news appears to have strengthened the appeal of alternatives seeking to better serve this use case.  For example, bitcoin cash supporters have been boasting its appeal as a network with larger blocks (and therefore, theoretically, more capacity), encouraging some investors to move out of bitcoin and into bitcoin cash. A few supporters are even going so far as to envision an eventual (but probably unlikely) ""flippening"" could occur if BCH overtakes bitcoin.  Still, CoinMarketCap data also shows that the BCH rally is being fuelled by exchanges offering BCH/KRW pairs and BCH/BTC pairs.  So will the rally continue? The price action analysis points to short-term overbought conditions and a possible upcoming correction.  4-hour chart  The chart above shows:  Prices rallied sharply following a bull flag breakout (a bullish continuation pattern and resembles flag and pole).  The relative strength index is overbought.  View  A short-term correction cannot be ruled out, given the overbought conditions, although broader outlook remains bullish as long as prices hold above $600 levels.  Overall, bitcoin cash looks set to set new record highs above $1,000, courtesy of the bull flag breakout. As per the textbook rules, the rally following the breakout equals the height of the pole. Accordingly, the doors have been opened for a rally to $1027 levels.

42380048,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LmNL,1510322404,"Bitcoin Isn't 'Too Expensive,' Says BTCC Boss Bobby Lee","""There was a joke on social media, some guy lost his sex drive because he sold bitcoin after the China ban.""  And with that, Bobby Lee, the CEO of China's oldest cryptocurrency exchange BTCC, launched into a scheduled speech extolling the virtues of bitcoin. Coming at the end of day one of the two-day technical conference Scaling Bitcoin last weekend, the talk amounted to a pep rally largely aimed at classical bitcoin bogeymen – the state, ICO scammers and those who don't get it.  But while he was speaking to just a few hundred of the foremost technical experts on the subject, it's ironically those in the wider world who Lee might have been better off addressing in his full remarks.  ""Bitcoin's value does not come from the endorsement, acceptance or regulation from governments. Bitcoin's value comes from the inherent failures, limitations and inconveniences of the fiat money system,” Lee said in a tone befitting a grade school science teacher.  From there, he proceeded to defend the price of bitcoin – up more than 600 percent on the year – not as a bubble, but as evidence the protocol is proving its utility as the best way to hold value in the digital age.  Far from being tepid about the market, Lee argued those who have been on the fence should invest in bitcoin today, telling the crowd:  ""The last year, bitcoin has proven itself. What I tell my friends now, is as long as bitcoin is under $10,000, it's your chance to get in. For those of you [who] think it's too expensive, if you look in the rearview mirror, bitcoin has gone up 10x in the last year.""  Lee went on to describe bitcoin as ""very cheap,"" arguing that prospective buyers shouldn't look at the current price, but rather conceive of the potential the protocol could have when more of the world's assets migrate to the blockchain.  ""Bitcoin is like buying gold at a 98 percent discount. If you think it's too late, if I had thought that back in 2012, I would not own bitcoin,"" Lee continued.  Jam-packed with no shortage of attempts to entertain, the speech went on to outline common ""mistakes"" made by more novice bitcoin traders, including four that Lee cited as the most detrimental. These included: ""indecisiveness,"" ""not buying enough,"" ""selling after a small gain"" and ""selling during a panic crash.""  ""When you first learn about bitcoin you hesitate, the answer is to not be hesitant,"" he said.  On China  Still, the talk was not without its more serious moments.  For example, Lee opened up at length about the difficult situation for his startup, which has pivoted internationally after finding itself on the receiving end of the negative actions that can occur when bitcoin ""challenges governments.""  This September, the Chinese government moved abruptly to shut down ICOs (the sale of custom cryptocurrencies for fundraising), at the time, allegedly acting behind the scenes to take exchanges offline.  In response to the news, the market reacted strongly – dropping below $3,000 after hitting a new all-time high of $4,000 in the weeks before. Lee went on to note that ""no one dares talk about"" what happened next: the effective doubling of the price.  And while no formal ban was made, Lee affirmed his belief that China still ""doesn't want to see bitcoin anymore,"" and that to his knowledge, no trading or price information can be displayed to consumers.  ""No ICOs, no bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, no more. That's the rule right now. I don't know where you buy bitcoin in China. It's like buying guns and pornography in China,"" he said.  That's not to say he doesn't see the market ever coming back, but he's not optimistic about the timeline.  State cryptos are coming  While there was focus on China, the remarks are perhaps best seen as part of a broader point: state actors will and are trying to infringe on bitcoin.  Lee made clear he believes the actions in China are simply the first sign of what the bitcoin community has long suspected will occur, that central banks will try to issue ""digital crypto versions of their money system.""  ""Those will be state-controlled, state-supplied. Today bitcoin accounts are freely generated, those will be assigned to you and assigned identity. I don't think we'll be close to a decentralized cryptocurrency,"" he said.  Lee, however, was adamant in his belief that bitcoin – and by extension, its developers or businesses – shouldn't bend the knee in response.  He concluded:  ""I don't think bitcoin needs to cater to any culture or nationality of its users. Bitcoin is global, it cuts across all language and cultural barriers.""

42380054,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LmW9,1510319148,"Bull Grip Weakens As Bitcoin Price Breaks Below $7,000","Bitcoin remains on the back foot ahead of the weekend.  According to Coindesk's Bitcoin Price Index, the number one cryptocurrency by total network value fell below $7,000 at 11:25 UTC this morning and hit an eight-day low of$6,793. A minor bid wave seen during the Asian session today quickly ran out of steam above $7,300.  At press time, the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate is trading at $6,799 levels. As per data from CoinMarketCap, bitcoin has dropped 4.76 percent in the last 24 hours.  Following the setting of a new record high of $7,879 Wednesday, the bull grip now looks to be weakening – likely due to the rotation of money out of bitcoin and into alternative currencies following the suspension of the Segwit2x hard fork on Wednesday.  The odds look high that the sell-off will continue too, given the month's rally from $5,000 was in part a product of the perception that holders of bitcoin might receive free money should the hard fork result in a split of the bitcoin blockchain. Thus, the cryptocurrency could shed a significant portion of the $2,800 gains.  Looking ahead, the price action analysis indicates the odds are stacked against the bulls.  Bitcoin chart  The above chart shows:  Bearish price relative strength index (RSI) divergence  Double top reversal pattern with neckline support at $6,900  The RSI has breached the rising trend line  The trendline sloping upwards from the Sep. 15 low and Oct. 5 low is seen offering support around $6,260 levels.  View  BTC looks set to breach the double top neckline support of $6,900. A close below $6,900 on the 1-hour chart could yield a sell-off to $6,200 (target as per the measured height method).  However, only an end of the day close below the rising trend line support would signal a long-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.  On the higher side, a break above $7,500 would revive the bullish move.

42380041,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LmEX,1510312219,Bitcoin Classic Team to Cease Code Support In Wake of 2x Suspension,"A group of developers coding under the banner ""Bitcoin Classic,"" which makes up less than 1% of bitcoin nodes, will no longer provide support for the alternative software, claiming another protocol is achieving what they set out to do.  Speaking in a blog post, release manager for Bitcoin Classic, Tom Zander, said today that, given the suspension of the Segwit2x hard fork this week, he believes bitcoin's scaling problem will continue, and that the functionality of bitcoin cash will likely surpass that of bitcoin.  Zander wrote:  ""In at most six months I'm sure we'll just drop the 'Cash' and call it 'Bitcoin'.""  Initiated in 2016, Bitcoin Classic's stated goal was to increase bitcoin's transaction capacity by raising the block size from 1MB to 2MB, however, it failed to gain traction among the cryptocurrency's global software users. While at one point, more than 2,000 Bitcoin Classic nodes comprised nearly one-third of the network, today less than 1 percent of network users run the software.  Now, through bitcoin cash, which allows for adjustable block sizes and a default of 8MB, ""Classic has fulfilled its promise,"" the post states.  Earlier this week, the team behind controversial scaling proposal Segwit2x said it will not proceed due to a lack of consensus surrounding the hard fork.  Due to this decision, Zander wrote that the those behind the so-called ""legacy chain"" (his term for the bitcoin blockchain), ""would rather go down with their ship"" than upgrade the software to keep up with the rising numbers of transactions.  As such, he said, Classic will cease operations ""in a matter of days or weeks,"" urging all miners and nodes currently supporting the network to immediately migrate to an alternative.  Earlier this year  , bitcoin activated a scaling solution called SegWit, which increases transaction quantity without raising the block size, and paves the way for future off-chain scaling solutions. However, the impact this has had on the network has so far been minimal, leading some to criticize the software.  While this has been attributed to a lack of adoption in the industry, Zander states that bitcoin's failure to increase the block size limit merely ""confirms the Cash chain's viability."" With this perspective, Zander joins others in predicting that bitcoin cash will flourish following the Segwit2x cancellation.

42380053,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LmSN,1510304452,Ethereum to ICOs: You're Doing It Wrong,"""Grotesque"" might not be the word you'd think ethereum developers would ascribe to today's ICO scene.  But that's exactly how some of the platform's ardent supporters described the current state of affairs. At Devcon3 in Cancun, Mexico, last week, developers were decidedly unenthusiastic when approached for thoughts about the new funding method, some going so far as to allege that many projects that use it to raise money are little more than ""scams.""  Even Fabian Vogelstellar, the developer behind the technology standard that helped make ethereum tokens so easy to launch, was keen to join the ranks of ICO critics, echoing remarks made by a colorful cast of commentators as diverse as MIT Media Lab Director Joi Ito and the ""Wolf of Wall Street"" Jordan Belfort.  Vogelstellar told CoinDesk:  ""The problem right now is that too many people outside of the blockchain space focus on tokens and ICOs; frankly speaking, it's the least interesting part of ethereum.""  Yet, ethereum has seen meteoric growth this year, in part, due to the success of ICOs for open-source project and startup funding.  Etherscan CEO and founder Matthew Tan went so far as to call ICOs ethereum's ""killer app,"" a statement that aligns with the more than 10,000 token projects launched to date – 13 of which have eclipsed $100 million in total market value, according to Etherscan data.  However, that path to capital still has a stigma.  ""Many [ICOs] seem like a cash grab from people who were unable to raise money from venture capitalists. In many cases, these are poorly thought out tokens predicated on centralized products,"" Jack du Rose, co-founder of ethereum startup Colony, said.  It's an interesting take seeing how ICOs are typically touted as a means to circumvent traditional fundraising methods. But, du Rose's sentiments hint at a crucial criticism: that many ICOs are simply executing incorrectly.  Product, then ICO  Only intensifying developer distrust of ICO issuers is the fact that many of today's projects collect money – often millions of dollars – before they have a product.  Ethereum developers largely believe that, at the very least, the individuals or company behind an ICO should have a prototype to prove their idea could theoretically work in practice. For instance, ethereum-based casino game platform FunFair launched an ICO over the summer, but only after releasing several prototypes.  And FunFair founder and CEO Jez San Obe had strong words about issuers that do it differently.  ""You should have a product before you ICO, you should know how to run a company, you shouldn't have an anonymous team and you should release a prototype first,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""When you describe a technology that no one can understand, you can hoodwink people. People throw money at it, you raise $100 million dollars and still don’t know how to build it.""  Having a product before launching an ICO is also important for du Rose, whose company looks to put a job market on the blockchain, not only because it adds credibility to their idea, but also because, in his mind, that's what the regulatory environment dictates.  According to du Rose, it's not worth it to ""risk other people's money on something, when there’s a reasonable likelihood we'd be prosecuted.""  To him, issuing a token before the product is not only foolish from a regulatory standpoint, but also ""incompetent and greedy.""  Keep it decentralized  And that aligns with du Rose's ideas as a ""purist"" (a description he said applies to many developers on this topic), meaning that tokens and the products they'll be used for should have some sort of decentralized component.  ICOs have gained notoriety not only because they've allowed individuals with novel ideas and startups to raise substantial amounts of money, but also because the decentralized structure allowed them to circumvent traditional fund-raising methods.  But when a decentralized token sale funds a centralized product, many developers feel there's something off.  ""For a token to be interesting ... it should be a totally decentralized protocol, not just glitter on top of a centralized company with its own revenue models,"" du Rose said.  In this way – although probably curiously for some – Giveth founder Griff Green pointed to The DAO as an ICO success story. Though its code had a bug that led to millions of dollars in ether being stolen from users, it was at least decentralized, said Green, who was the community organizer of the project.  He thinks about The DAO in a more abstract way, though, saying that, in the future, people will be able to launch their own cryptocurrency to push against the power of the banks.  ""The power of creating currency is unfathomable. Banks are in a really good spot today. They have a lot of money and a lot of power. They can create money out of nothing. Instead, with ICOs, you can give that power to every person,"" Green said.  Learning curve  While many stakeholders in the cryptocurrency community believe the ICO space is fraught with bad actors, others more judiciously see it as all part of the learning process, with people trying to figure out just what ethereum and other blockchain technologies are (and aren't) capable of.  ""What I've seen is kind of unsurprising,"" said DappHub software engineer Andy Milenius. ""People's first experience with an idea is allowed to be wrong.""  That said, he hopes the community will begin to turn a more critical eye towards projects using the ICO model.  ""The one thing that unites people in blockchain is skepticism of the status quo, but when ICOs appear, skepticism flies out the window sometimes,"" Melenius said.  Although, there could be some reversal happening already, he said, pointing to October's totals – when ICOs raised less than the month before, the first time that's happened since the boom started.  But, Milenius concluded, with what seemed like a tender reminder that experience is the best teacher:  ""People aren't going to know until they try.""

The CSD Working Group on DLT was formed earlier this year by a group of companies responsible for storing huge amounts of financial instruments, including Russia’s National Settlement Depository (NSD), as well as central securities depositories from South Africa, Switzerland, Sweden, Chile, Argentina and the United Arab Emirates.  Announced this week, however, the CSD Working Group on DLT has outlined the technical requirements for a proxy voting platform to be used in shareholder meetings.  The details were shared during a workshop which included IBM, Hyperledger and Swift, with the latter assisting in ensuring the document adhered to the ISO 20022 standard.  According to the project's outline  , the group hewed to the ISO 20022 standard – used for financial messages – in an effort to ensure that the final product can be applied across a broad spectrum of services.  The ultimate goal is to create an e-proxy voting system which is both secure and transparent. The system would automatically allow or disallow voting privileges for members based on what voting rights they had within a particular organization.  Minority stakeholders would not have as many rights as majority stakeholders, according to the previously revealed plans.  ""It appears that together with our partners we have managed to create a good working format and cooperation atmosphere aimed at creating new services and lowering the costs for the clients of CSDs,"" Eddie Astanin, chairman of NSD's executive board, said in a statement.

The European Union’s executive arm revealed the details of the blockchain contest this week, dubbed ""Blockchains for Social Good,"" which it quietly revealed back in August. The competition seeks entries from those who can propose solutions for public issues, leveraging the technology to provide a mix of greater transparency and decentralization.  Winning entries must have a clear social impact, be decentralized while allowing for transparency, and still be both useful and scalable, according to the contest webpage. The commission is specifically hoping for a novel distributed ledger technology (DLT) application which can demonstrate viable use cases, according to the page.  Officials said:  ""The potential of DLTs to generate positive social change by decentralising and disintermediating processes related to local or global sustainability challenges is still largely untapped.""  A key component of any solution must be transparency, according to the site. EU citizens must be able to determine what the commission is doing through its administrative and production processes.  Using blockchains to increase transparency has been a consistent priority for the commission. This past August, the organization’s vice president, Valdis Dombrovskis, stated that the body was building a Financial Transparency Gateway to make available the data companies share with national databases.  Any legal person or entity can submit entries to the contest, regardless of whether they are based in the EU or not. Entries should be submitted by mid-2019. The winner will be announced in the beginning of 2020.  The contest adds to funding the economic bloc's governing bodies have already committed to supporting the tech.

42380052,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8LmTd,1510281659,Comcast's Blockchain Patent Filing Highlights Data Use Case,"A new patent filing from telecommunications provider Comcast suggests the firm is looking at how to store operational data on a blockchain.  In a new patent application released by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Nov. 9, the telecom outlined two types databases which would hold its customers' information. One of these databases, according to the filing, would be based on the distributed blockchain concept.  The blockchain database would hold private and identifying information for customers, and would only be accessible by certain entities. In a bid to boost transparency, the proposed system would maintain a log of every time someone accessed it.  The other database – which would still be on a distributed platform but not explicitly a blockchain – could contain location information for the user data on the other database, acting as a roadmap for entities trying to access the customer data.  As the application explains:  ""The block identifies all relevant information relating to the particular data access including, for example, the particular data that was accessed, the entity that accessed the data, and the date and time of the access. After a block is generated, it is encrypted and added to the chain of existing blocks.""  In the application, Comcast notes that customers use multiple systems and services to watch programming, ranging from websites like Hulu on computers to traditional televisions. It aims to collate customers' viewing habits across different platforms, creating a repository for this information.  The application is a first for Comcast, but past developments show that the company is no stranger to blockchain.  In June  , Comcast partnered with Disney, NBCUniversal, Cox Communications, Mediaset Italia, Channel 4 and TF1 on creating a new blockchain-based advertising platform.
