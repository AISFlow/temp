42400056,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzTM2,1497908425,Warning: Cryptocurrency Scams Are Posing as China's Central Bank,"The People's Bank of China (PBoC) has issued a new warning alleging that cryptocurrency projects are misusing its name in an effort to defraud investors.  Issued on 15th June, the announcement sought to make public the issue, while clarifying that the central bank has not issued any digital currency or authorized any institution to do so. Adding to that, it reiterated that there is no digital currency marketing team at the PBoC, nor does the institution consider applications of the technology legal tender.  The PBoC went so far as to warn Chinese consumers that so-called ""digital currencies issued by PBoC"" could be a part of a pyramid scheme.  The PBoC concluded that:  ""We call on the public to establish a correct concept of money, cherish the RMB and maintain a normal circulation of RMB together.""  In broader context, the comments are the latest that find China's central bank stepping up its regulation of the cryptocurrency sector. (Earlier this year, it sought to aggressively police domestic exchanges amid a surge in the bitcoin price.)  Lending plausibility to the scams, they also come at a time when the PBoC is actively increasing its blockchain research and development, and former representatives of the institution have begun to up about the technology and its potential impact.

42400051,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzTG8,1497902424,Bank of Thailand Governor Heralds Blockchain's Coming Impact,"The Bank of Thailand is opening up about the potential for blockchain disruption.  In remarks last week, Dr Veerathai Santiprabhob, the deputy chairman of the central bank's 14-member board, commented on the changing role of global finance, calling emerging technological innovations both an ""opportunity"" and a ""challenge"" while noting that he believes the nation's domestic financial institutions largely need to embrace change.  Speaking broadly about the impact of new technologies from smartphones to big data, Dr Santiprabhob discussed how blockchains and distributed ledger technologies could come to replace central institutions.  Elsewhere, he explained how blockchains and distributed ledgers are able to distribute transactions broadly, making members of any network aware of changes and consequences.  While short, the remarks are notable given the lack of public dialogue from the central bank on matters relating to cryptocurrencies and blockchain. In the past, the central bank has gone so far as to warn about the potential dangers of the technology, though businesses have often been left seeking clarity.  However, the new statements indicate change could be on the way as Thailand's financial institutions begin experimenting with the technology, a move that could perhaps both open up and ease the sometimes tense national conversation domestically.

42400057,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzTN1,1497897627,Litecoin's Price Tops $50 to Set New All-Time High,"After three years of ups and downs, the price of the cryptocurrency litecoin has finally set a new all-time high.  Launched in late 2011 as an optimization of bitcoin's open-source code, litecoin has since seen its share of volatility – its previous all-time high was $53.15 in November 2013. However, this figure proved so outsized that even amidst a broader increase in the cryptocurrency market earlier this year, litecoin was unable to join other cryptocurrencies in setting new highs.  That, however, has changed due to a decision by UK-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp to list the asset, announcing on Twitter that it had made the decision earlier today.  In this light, litecoin has now completed a journey that began when the cryptocurrency's price began pushing higher in March, bolstered by anticipation surrounding its implementation of Segregated Witness (SegWit), a software upgrade that allows the protocol to handle more transactions.  Litecoin prices have surged more than 1,000% in the last 90 days as the network gathered the needed support and then implemented the upgrade, providing a notable contrast to the last three years when it largely strived to determine a relevant use case.

42400055,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzTK4,1497893105,Bitcoin Miners Unite Behind Scaling Proposal Segwit2x,"The majority of bitcoin's mining power is lining up behind a scaling solution that would increase the network's transaction capacity.  Known as Segwit2x, the proposal – if passed – could mark a significant advancement in bitcoin's years-long scaling debate, effectively spurring the activation of Segregated Witness (SegWit), a scaling proposal introduced by developers in 2015, and doubling the current 1 MB block size. But while the actual Segwit2x code is not ready for mining pools to run yet (it's still in the testing phase until 30th June), this isn't stopping mining pools from demonstrating they support the measure.  Mining pools AntPool, Bitcoin.com, Bitfury, Bixin, BTC.com, BTC.top, BW Pool, F2Pool, and ViaBTC (which represent about 71% of the network's mining power) are already adding a piece of text to each block that they mine to show their support.  Once the code is ready for showtime on 21st July, mining pools will be able to run the software. The Segwit2x scaling agreement will require 80% of the mining hashrate to run the code for roughly three days starting on that date.  Mining firms already announced their intent to support Segwit2x, but after a meeting in Chengdu last week, 16 total mining manufacturers, exchanges and mining pools "" unanimouslyhttps://pastebin.com/b3St9VCF"" agreed to a set of resolutions, including their intent to follow through with locking in SegWit by 31st July.  As such, the roundtable bears similarities to past miner meetings, such as one held in late-April where mining pools agreed to signal support for SegWit on litecoin, an alternative blockchain platform.  In the resolution, there is also no explicit mention of BIP 148, a soft fork that aims to lock-in SegWit in a different way, and whose supporters have been vocal about what they feel has been a resistance to SegWit over political and social issues.  As for whether the full terms of Segwit2x will be enacted, however, that remains to be seen.  A hard fork has long been seen as a contentious move by developers and some users. (Mining pool ViaBTC is already taking steps to indicate it could take aggressive actions to ensure a hard fork would enforce a 2 MB upgrade).  As such, it remains unclear what the final impact of Segwit2x will be on the network, and how many mining pools will ultimately run the terms of the resolution.

42400047,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzTDB,1497887443,Financial Firms Offer Diverse Blockchain Views in European Commission Response,"The executive branch of the European Union has officially completed a public consultation on FinTech and distributed ledger technology (DLT), and the results of its outreach are becoming public.  Entitled ""Public consultation on FinTech: a more competitive and innovative European financial sector"", the consultation granted any consumer or business the ability to answer a questionnaire that sought to clarify general sentiment on financial technologies, including blockchain and DLT.  Now with the comment period officially concluded on 15th June, companies and organizations as diverse as Euroclear, the European Association of CCP Clearing Houses (EACH), the European Payment Institutions Federation (EPIF) and the European Consumer Voice in Standardization are going public with comments on DLT's regulatory obstacles and risks.  Launched in March, the survey asked participants to answer questions such as ""What's the most promising use cases of FinTech?"", ""Which DLT applications are likely to offer opportunities to small and middle sized enterprises?"" and ""What are the main regulatory or supervisory obstacles to the development of DLT solutions?"", among others.  So far, it seems comments have been optimistic about the development of DLT, with most submissions calling it one of the most promising use cases of fintech in terms of bringing down costs and increasing efficiency.  Regulatory split  However, the most notable comments came in response to the question of how the European government should be involved in any transition to DLT more broadly, as opinions on a path forward were largely split.  EACH, the membership group for the region's central counterparties, argued that it is in favor of the private market leading the charge to evaluate and implement the technology. It went on to state that regulators would be expected to play a role in permissioned blockchain systems, and that the industry should move to ensure they're able to use the technology to monitor such systems.  By contrast, the EPIF, which represents payment institutions, suggested a more forceful hand will be needed to spur market development.  ""The lack of regulatory guidance, or government intervention, has held back the maturity, usability and safety of cryptocurrencies,"" it wrote.  Elsewhere, post-trade giant Euroclear, which is among the respondents openly experimenting with blockchain, advocated for a wait-and-see approach.  Euroclear wrote:  ""Regulators will need to pay close attention to ... the links between trading, clearing and settlement providers where new operational risks might be created if different parts of the value chain implement different approaches to DLT at different times and with non-standardized business practices.""  For now, it remains to be seen whether additional comments, with more forceful opinions, will be published as responses come to light.

42400043,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzT9F,1497883212,Russia's National Payment Card Provider: Blockchain Isn't for Us,"Russia's state-backed card payment provider believes it's not possible or necessary to apply blockchains and distributed ledgers in its business.  Revealed in a new interview with RIA, the country's international news agency, Vladimir Komlev, the head of the National System of Payment Cards (NSPK), remarked that blockchain technology is like any technology in that it has a niche where it is needed – but that this may be limited.  In interview, he argued that the current payment card system, set up after 2013 sanctions imposed by major US-based card issuers and wholly owned by the Central Bank of Russia, is not exposed to problems that need to be solved by blockchain, and that as such, he does not see any industrial application of the technology.  Having said that, group efforts from Russian banks, payment firms and financial startups, under governance of the Central Bank of Russia, are showing signs of moving forward.  The country's Association of Fintech, for example, recently advanced its 'Masterchain' blockchain software, first revealed in October 2016. According to the Central Bank of Russia, the system is a technical prototype that uses a distributed ledger to pass financial information among parties with data actuality.  The NSPK's statements are notable as they showcase the changing narrative around blockchain domestically. As far back as 2013, Russian government officials have had a sometimes conflicted relationship with blockchains and cryptocurrencies.  Still, the same report asserted that legal clarity might be on the way, as it said a government working group led by First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov is likely to propose legislative changes designed to accommodate blockchain technology by the end of 2017.

42400049,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzTCC,1497877252,'Absolutely Necessary': How Blockchain Could Help Tech Giant Cisco Reboot,"Cisco is changing.  The technology firm best known as the supplier of enterprise computer hardware has seen a slow, steady decline in revenue from some of its core products. As a result of an increasing number technological services being virtualized, and the storage of information moving to the cloud, the $158bn firm has been restructuring and exploring new ways to capitalize on connected devices.  But amidst this change in identity, it's in identity itself where some of the California-based company's most interesting new experiments are taking place. With a series of early stage blockchain projects, Cisco is now pushing even deeper into what could end up being much more than a way for employees to prove who they are across subsidiaries.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Robert Greenfield IV, Cisco software engineer and executive team lead of the firm's Connected Black Professionals resource group, explained how several blockchain projects have evolved into a new way for corporations to prove identity.  Greenfield said:  ""On a grand scale, it's going to be absolutely necessary for Cisco to really master blockchain technology, because it's bridging the gap between hardware and what Cisco as a company is transitioning towards, which is software and security.""  Corporate identity on a blockchain  Founded in 1984, Cisco Systems was one of the first members of the blockchain consortium Hyperledger, led by the Linux Foundation.  After remaining largely under the radar (while other members of the group made splashy headlines), the company earlier this year revealed its role in helping launch a new consortium with BNY Mellon, Foxconn and others aimed at investigating how connected devices could be integrated with distributed ledger technology.  In interview, Greenfield expanded on earlier reports that Cisco was focused on work related to the group – formally called the Trusted IoT Alliance – related to distributed identity and supply chain management.  It turns out, not only is Cisco exploring how to distribute identity to simplify employee logins across more than 20 of the company's subsidiaries, but that Cisco's customers themselves may someday use the service to better audit the transactions of suppliers.  According to Greenfield, many database standards still have difficulty recognizing that a subsidiary is actually part of a parent company, making it hard to track who conducted which transactions and under whose authority.  ""We wanted to create a blockchain ID use case that uses the different APIs across these different organizations, and internal applications to establish one identity for internal users,"" he said. ""But also customers as well, where it’s going to be easier to perform analysis.""  Increased security  With so many points of entry, the attack vectors for potential hackers also increase, resulting in a greater potential security threat.  So, in addition to linking APIs associated with each subsidiary to blockchain-based corporate identities and employee identities, Greenfield said Cisco would like to upgrade its current two-factor authentication to a blockchain-based multi-signature functionality.  ""There's a lot of points of entry that hackers, people who want to corrupt the network, can get into,"" said Greenfield. ""So, it's a security issue, but it's also an efficiency issue.""  If all goes as planned, Greenfield says the blockchain-based identities capable of granting access across subsidiaries, could one day expand the security benefits beyond the confines of Cisco itself and be used to prove identity to other organizations as well.  He said:  ""It's early stages in terms of creating the security handshakes on the blockchain for this type of security for identity. But everything in terms of outlining how this would work has been created and criticized. Now we're going into the MVP [minimum viable product] module.""  Evolving business model  But Cisco's push into blockchain goes beyond portable, decentralized identities. Also springing from the Trusted IoT Alliance is a project to move Cisco’s complex supply chain to a distributed ledger.  In partnership with several startup members of the alliance, Cisco is currently exploring how its identity work could be integrated with a private version of the ethereum blockchain to track hardware, including routers and switches, according to Greenfield.  In spite of generating a total of $49.2bn in revenue last year, Cisco has reported declining sales in its routers and switches category for each of the past five quarters, according to a Search Networking report earlier this year.  If Cisco’s complex supply chain can be further simplified by integrating it with blockchain or machine-to-machine communication, Greenfield argued that entirely new smart contract-enabled services could be built directly into the hardware.  ""It gives a viable solution to regain recently lost market share,"" said Greenfield. ""Particularly in router and switch markets, and maintain global dominance within the Internet of Things.""  United conversations  This week stands to mark multiple milestones in the history of Cisco's early blockchain work.  While much of the firm's efforts with the technology are aimed at finding efficiencies on the enterprise side of its operations, the firm's independently operated non-profit, the Cisco Foundation, is also exploring blockchain.  Greenfield works as a liaison with the foundation, and today he expects to begin a partnership with non-profit Street Code to help increase the number of minority coders in blockchain. Another partnership with Black Girls Code is in the early stages of development.  Further, Greenfield said he will soon meet with one of the technology partners working with the UN to explore how the two organizations might improve identity to better serve both those in need internationally and locally in the US.  Greenfield concluded:  ""Over the next few months, there's going to be some tangible results and [proofs-of-concept] developed out of that. They're very intensely looking into it.""

42400042,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzTBD,1497873611,UK Financial Regulator Calls for Caution on Cryptocurrency Investing,"An official at the UK's top financial regulator has issued new comments calling for consumer caution on bitcoin and cryptocurrency investing.  As reported by Financial News, Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) director of strategy and competition Chris Woolard addressed the subject at a blockchain event held by the regulator last week. While affirming the regulator's enthusiasm for blockchain at the time, Woolard voiced concern about the recent meteoric growth observed in the cryptocurrency markets.  In particular, he argued more perhaps should be done to alert consumers that cryptocurrencies are not regulated financial instruments and, as such, they don't have the consumer protections associated with more mature assets.  According to the news source, Woolard said:  ""I am not saying that we view digital currencies as an inherently bad thing … but we do have to exercise a degree of caution.""  Woolard went on to pledge that the FCA would continue to ring the alarm over potential suspicious actors in the industry – a role it has long played. Among others, the FCA has previously issued warnings against a suspicious crypto trading website and a digital currency scheme called OneCoin that has drawn the ire of several global regulators.  Still, the FCA has proved to be among the more progressive regulators on the issue as well, granting US startup Circle Internet Financial, at the time a bitcoin brokerage, an e-money license in 2016.  As recently as last week, the agency further revealed it has increased its commitment to industry startups through a 'sandbox' initiative by helping to incubate nine new blockchain and distributed ledger startups.

42400048,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzTF9,1497870063,Nevada Senator: We Want to Be 'Home Base' for Blockchain Startups,"""We want them here, we value them and they should give us a hard look.""  That's the message Nevada Senator Ben Kieckhefer wants to convey to blockchain and cryptocurrency startups the world over.  The lead sponsor of a recently passed bill that prohibits the taxation of blockchain technology in the US state, Kieckhefer affirmed in new interview that Nevada is committed to leading the way in providing a stable legal framework and business-friendly environment for industry innovators.  He told CoinDesk:  ""It's certainly the hope that this environment will draw the attention of people who are interesting in starting companies or looking for a home base for a company and utilizing blockchain.""  Kieckhefer first introduced the legislation in March aiming to prohibit taxes or fees on blockchains and smart contracts used by the state or local governments, while at the same time recognizing the legality of blockchain signatures. The bill was quickly approved by both the House and Senate and signed into law by Governor Brian Sandoval on 5th June.  The goal, according to Kieckhefer, was to create a safe and predictable operating environment for blockchain businesses that puts Nevada in a similar category as Arizona, which recently adopted its own bill to recognize smart contract signatures.  Other states served as reference points, though not in a positive way. For example, Kieckhefer had choice words for New York’s 'BitLicense', a controversial state-specific licensing regime that some argue is too arduous, expensive and restrictive.  ""We've seen what New York did, and we certainly didn’t want to go in that direction,"" he said.  Pre-emptive strike  Because blockchain use was not being taxed or regulated in Nevada to begin with, though, why was such a bill necessary in the first place?  Kieckhefer emphasized that the ban creates long-term stability for blockchain operators and an impediment for future legislators and regulators who may see the technology as a piñata for new revenue.  With no personal income tax and no corporate income tax on receipts below a $4m threshold, Nevada has what some consider a favorable business environment. But, the flip side is that state and municipal governments have to get extra creative in coming up with new fees and taxes to fill the coffers.  ""[The bill] wasn't designed specifically to address a problem that currently exists, but designed to head one off at the pass to make sure we didn’t end up in a situation where local governments, for example, were trying to regulate or tax the use of blockchain,"" he said, adding:  ""This is an effort to put to rest any suggestion that local governments might look at a new and emerging technology as a way to generate additional revenue.""  Allison Clift-Jennings, founder and CEO of blockchain startup Filament – a Reno-based IoT company, told CoinDesk that the bill is critical to her business because it clears up some of the confusion surrounding the enforcement of smart contracts.  The bill also opens the door for municipalities to explore the use of blockchains without fear of repercussion.  Leader of the pack  As Nevada has gone through leaps and bounds to attract larger companies like Tesla to domicile in the state, it may not be a surprise that Kieckhefer said that his priority is creating a fertile ground for startups and ""the next big company"".  Providing a level playing field for blockchain businesses vis-à-vis other states and sectors is a core component of that strategy.  ""I think that's all any entrepreneur really asks for, and I think this helps provide that,"" he said.  However, as with any legislative sausage-making process, there were several headaches along the way, including a dispute over the proper legal definition of a blockchain, and figuring out how to draft smart contract language in a timeless manner.  Ashley Clift-Jennings, a lobbyist who helped steward the bill's passage and wife of Allison Clift-Jennings, said that the bill was left ""fairly vague on purpose"" so as to make it continuously applicable to blockchain technology advances.  While other states have passed laws recently pertaining to money transmission businesses and the acceptance of smart contracts, she said, Nevada's bill is the broadest and most sweeping in nature.  Ashley explained:  ""We are different in that we are really just focused on blockchain. We didn't talk about bitcoin or crypto. We believe that the underlying technology is actually going to be much larger than just cryptocurrencies.""

42400052,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzTI6,1497865511,Forfeit Your Bitcoin? Congressional Bill Draws Fire Over Border Check Rules,"A group of US lawmakers wants to see cryptocurrency holdings declared at the nation's border – and advocates of the tech are pushing back.  Introduced last month  , the Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Counterfeiting Act of 2017 – which is actually the third iteration of a bill that debuted in 2011 – would bring a range of digital currency services under federal scrutiny, including those that provide transaction mixing services.  Yet, the provision that has attracted the particular ire of cryptocurrency advocates – especially those who prefer a regulation-light environment – is one that would make such holdings subject to disclosure requirements at US customs checkpoints. This means if a person trying to enter the country has more than $10,000 worth of bitcoin in their possession, under the proposed legal change, they would need to inform the relevant authorities.  Such requirements are already in place for payment methods like cash. But given the rising public profile of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, coupled with the perception among policymakers that they could be used to fund terrorist activities, is driving legislative efforts like the bill currently under consideration.  One observer, Joe Ciccolo of Canada-based BitAML, remarked that cryptocurrency has become the ""new face in an old debate"", going on to say that policymakers and law enforcement officials have long sought to expand the definition of what constitutes a ""monetary instrument"".  Ciccolo told CoinDesk:  ""Earlier this decade, we saw a push to include 'prepaid access' such as gift cards. Law enforcement went so far as to pursue card readers to scan prepaid access devices for their balance. Now that digital currencies have gained traction, they've been included in the same conversation. As in the past, I suspect there will be strong opposition from across the financial services community.""  Perianne Boring, president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, a blockchain trade advocacy organization, said the legislation is ""not necessary"" given the existence of regulations from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which require exchanges services to register as money transmission businesses and adhere to federal reporting requirements.  ""While we encourage thoughtful and meaningful study of the prevention of cross-border financial crime, the storage of virtual currency carries different and complex considerations than those attributable to prepaid access,"" she told CoinDesk.  Asset grab  It's clear from the response that the frustration toward the measure isn't going anywhere. That anger surfaced in earnest over the past week or so in social media postings and fiery blog entries about the move.  One of the points of concern is a policy called 'civil asset forfeiture'. In the US, law enforcement officials have faced strong opposition to the rules, by which assets, particularly cash, can be seized if they are suspected of being connected to criminal activity. Proponents say it deters money laundering and – controversially – provides a funding means for police forces in the US.  Under the proposed bill, cryptocurrencies would be included in that definition, subject to confiscation by border agents.  The practice has drawn fire in recent years over instances in which innocent people have their funds taken from them, triggering legal processes that can play out for months or longer before any money is returned.  In one high-profile example in 2015, a US man had $16,000 in cash taken from him while he tried to relocate to Hollywood despite the fact that he wasn't suspected of a specific crime. And data published earlier this month by the Chicago Tribune illustrated how the policy tends to target lower-income residents who, if anything, are guilty of crimes of lower severity, if at all.  Investor and writer Simon Black, who pens the Sovereign Man blog, took aim at this aspect of the bill by declaring that, in the eyes of the US government, ""bitcoin is evil"" and should be up for grabs by border agents.  ""So, theoretically if you leave the US with more than $10,000 in bitcoin or ether, you'd have to confess this fact to the authorities or otherwise face the aforementioned penalties, ie prison time, civil asset forfeiture, etc,"" Black wrote.  ""HOORAY FREEDOM!"" he added.  Fighting on  Thus far, the bill hasn’t advanced significantly since being introduced last month, public records show. On 25th May, the measure was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee for further consideration.  At press time, representatives for Senators Chuck Grassley and Diane Feinstein hadn't responded to CoinDesk requests for comment. The bill is also being sponsored by Senators John Cornyn and Sheldon Whitehouse, constituting a group of two Republicans and two Democrats.  But at least one person is moving to wage a war against the bill’s provisions: Theo Chino, who as profiled by CoinDesk last November, has waged a persistent campaign against the New York State Department of Financial Services BitLicense regulatory framework.  He told CoinDesk in an email that he has set up a webpage with the relevant contact information for the senators who are sponsoring the bill. Chino himself has been reaching out to offices in an effort to educate lawmakers on what he described as ""misunderstandings of the technology"".  ""This 'over-criminalization' of bitcoin, based on common misunderstandings of the technology and its economic nature should be worrisome to the bitcoin and technology communities,"" he told CoinDesk.  The two main advocacy groups in Washington, DC – the Chamber of Digital Commerce and Coin Center – are said to be in contact with the relevant Congressional offices. Though it declined to comment on this story, Coin Center indicated on Twitter that it's reaching out amid the furor.  ""We are aware of S 1241, are in touch with the relevant folks in Congress, and will post an analysis soon,"" executive director Jerry Brito wrote on Twitter.  Chino – who in an email called the bill a ""sham"" – spoke to the grassroots effort taking place, and said that he’s still reaching out to people who have posted on Reddit as part of a broader bid to get constituents to contact the senators involved.  ""One call from a constituent has so much impact,"" he said.

The Emirates Islamic Bank's announcement last week that it was planning to integrate blockchain technology with paper checks may have left many pondering the incongruity: Why waste such a modern invention on such a traditional payment method? Aren’t paper checks like, you know, so last century?  However, dig a bit deeper and you find that things are not quite what they seem.  One peculiarity of the UAE banking system is the preferred form of security for bank loans: paper checks. The established practice is that the borrower writes the lender a post-dated check for the amount of the loan, plus interest. When the loan is due, the happy lender simply cashes the check. If the repayment is monthly, the lender will often ask for a stack of post-dated checks to cover the individual payments.  This makes the process of lending much easier. With a signed check in hand, the lender can avoid rigorous vetting procedures and confirmation hassles.  Also, banks often ask for a signed paper check to cover the monthly limit before issuing a customer with a credit card. Ah, you ask, but in all the above cases, how do they know the check won't bounce?  Game theory  It's a question of incentives. If you are an individual and your check bounces, you can go to jail.  At least, that was the case until a few years ago, when the bouncing of checks issued as collateral for an entire loan was decriminalized (not for monthly payments). Last year, the bouncing of any type of check from small and medium businesses (SMEs) was also decriminalized (but not yet for individuals).  With this in mind, the 'blockchain tech meets paper checks' idea becomes more interesting.  The project developed by the Emirates Islamic Bank (part of Emirates NDB, one of the largest banking groups in the Middle East) involves printing a unique QR code on each check and registering it on a blockchain platform. The checks will then be scanned when issued to validate authenticity.  Taking into account that checks are regularly used as loan collateral and repayment, the importance of their role in the financial system becomes apparent, as does the temptation to forge them. Being able to increase their reliability will be a relief to the banking sector.  Bigger impact  If banks can worry less about fraud, they are likely to be more willing to lend, which will have a positive effect on economic activity.  The IMF recently revised upwards its forecasts for the UAE to relatively healthy figures, but easier lending will boost the outlook for SMEs, the sector that was hardest hit by the oil price crunch of the past few years.  While an overhaul of the UAE banking system to reduce the reliance on checks is likely to eventually happen, deep cultural changes take time. The Emirates Islamic Bank idea could provide a short-term solution to a systemic problem, as well as evolve the sector’s understanding of the technology’s potential.  What's more, the concept of combining digital networks with pieces of paper is intriguing, and could point to a new vector of innovation.  Physical 'guarantees' of payment that are resistant to both forgery and technological vulnerabilities? We could be looking at the birth of a whole new type of financial instrument.
