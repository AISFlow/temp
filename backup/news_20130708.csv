42397171,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAacM4p,1373309965,Firmcoin: The reprogrammable physical bitcoin token explained,"We recently reported on the announcement of Firmcoin, a reprogrammable physical bitcoin token. This can be thought of as an option between Bitbills or Casascius coins and the Trezor hardware wallet. The amount that it carries is not fixed, but it's cheap enough to be exchanged as a physical token. We spoke to the man behind Firmcoin, Sergio Lerner to find out more.  Q. What is your background and training in?  SL: I was an assistant teacher in Cryptography at University of Buenos Aires. I have a Masters in Computer Science, and my thesis was on advances in Cryptography in Mental Poker protocols. I hold four patents on cryptographic apparatus and methods. I worked more than fifteen years in computer security and code breaking, both for the private sector and for the Argentinian government. I write about crypto in my blog (bitslog.wordpress.com). I received two awards in computer security contests hosted by CORE Security Technologies. I received two medals and four awards in international algorithm competitions (IOI/ACM).  Nevertheless, since I'm human I can make mistakes and that's why all Firmcoin protocols/code will be open for anyone to review.  Q. For first-time readers, would you please give a layperson explanation of what Firmcoin is?  SL: Firmcoins are the evolution of banknotes. For all that matters to common people, they have the same properties as paper money. The idea is that you will use a Firmcoin in any context where you would prefer using a banknote over a credit card. To pay for an item, you give the Firmcoins.  The main difference between paying with a Firmcoin and paying with your smartphone using a wallet application is that Firmcoin transactions are offline. You don't need an Internet connection, and it's even possible to accept Firmcoins with confidence without having a computer. They are anonymous, as much as banknotes can be (the banknote serial number could be used to track them, but there's not much an attacker can learn). Both banknotes and Firmcoins have security measures to prove their authenticity. In a banknote, you have physical countermeasures to prevent counterfeiting. Firmcoins have both physical and logical measures to prevent counterfeiting.  Firmcoins have an extraordinary additional property:  You can transfer coins from the Firmcoin to your bitcoin wallet back and forth without going to a bank or a trader. That makes them the most private bitcoin transfer system ever made.  - Unlike bank notes that hold bacteria, Firmcoins are nice-looking, crystal clear, 100% cleanable, geeky devices you will love to hold.  - There are two versions of Firmcoins: one holds only a fixed amount of bitcoin and the other can hold variable amounts of money, showing the amount in a nice e-paper display.  - The issuer of the Firmcoins need not be a bank, or a money transmitter, nor is it currently regulated in any other way (as far as I know).  - A Firmcoin can hold certifications of authenticity created from other entities, to increase even more the confidence in the device.  Q. How does this differ from the other physical representations of bitcoin?  SL: Most of the answers can be found on the Why? page on the Firmcoin website. However, Bitbills may be cheaper, but they are for one-time use, so you have to add the cost of wasted notes. Also, Bitbills are sold holding some BTC (they cannot be loaded by the buyer), so the Bitbill issuer may be regarded by governments as money transmitters/issuers, so they may try to regulate them, which would be overkill for the Bitbill cost.  Q. Why do you think there is a need for physical bitcoins?  SL: First, people love nice-looking physical objects. The first day I uploaded the Firmcoin.com webpage, people started asking me to sell them Firmcoins to give as gifts.  Second, as I said before, there are many contexts where either a computer/smartphone is not available:  - You may be too drunk to operate a hardware wallet properly!  - If you're in a dangerous place you may not want to have a smartphone with you that can be used (by extortion) to steal all your money in your account.  - You may be in Argentina, where merchants often cannot process credit cards or any electronic payment system because the network is down.  - You may be in the middle of the desert without a cellphone signal.  - You may want to give bitcoins to a friend that does not have a bitcoin account, nor understand how to use a bitcoin wallet application.  - You may want to buy something completely anonymously.  Q. Since Firmcoins are reprogrammable, could they be used for altcurrencies?  SL: Yes, they are designed to hold any kind of digitally transferable asset; any asset you can transfer by signing with a digital signature. They could even be used to hold fiat currencies, if governments decide that it is better to manufacture Firmcoins over banknotes because of counterfeit security, wear cost, public health, reduced cost of transport (since they can be turned online at any time), cost of acceptance (because it may be easier to check the authenticity of a Firmcoin over a banknote), etc.  I think that in fifty years, if physical money still exists, then they will all be Firmcoins. I was pleased to discover that in the futuristic online game Shadowrun, there exists a physical device called a credstick that behaves in some ways very much like Firmcoins (see http://firmcoin.com/?p=66).  Q. Would current Firmcoins require a significant modification to hold alternative types of data?  SL: Generally no, but it depends on the cryptographic algorithms required to sign the other types of data. Bitcoin uses ECDSA for signatures, and that's what we've implemented on the Firmcoin. Most cryptocurrencies are clones of bitcoin and so use the same signing scheme. If another cryptocurrency requires, for example, RSA signatures, then new firmware with RSA signing functions would be necessary to develop and program into the device.  Nevertheless, if you take out the functions that require signing and key generation, you can actually use the Firmcoin to store any piece of private data you wish (provided you load the device only from a trusted third party).  Q. Will a special smartphone app be needed to read and write to Firmcoins?  SL: Currently yes.  Our app can:  - query the Firmcoin for funds;  - download its private key;  - take a photo of the Firmcoin and compare it with a portable image database;  - request the device to prove the possession of a private key;  - check that the device has funds by searching the funding transactions in a portable UTXO set (the set of spendable coins);  - ask the device to generate a new private key;  - load funds into the key using a block-chain branch;  - request a certification party to provide fund certifications for the Firmcoin public key and load the certifications into the Firmcoin;  - verify the authenticity of the firmware, and some other cool things.  Q. Firmcoins communicate with the world via Near Field Communication (NFC). NFC is not standard in all smartphones. Most notably, the iPhone does not have NFC. How much of a problem do you see this as being for adoption of Firmcoin?  SL: I'm not a futurologist, but I'm sure that NFC is here to stay. It's just a matter of time until the iPhone will include an NFC reader. The most notable aspect of NFC technology is that NFC tags are passive (without batteries) and can be powered from the NFC reader, so they can be really cheap. A portable NFC reader with another communication interface to a smartphone costs so little that you can convert any smartphone in an NFC-enabled device.  Q. Your blog says you're going to Kickstarter for funding - is this your only source of funding?  SL: Currently I'm being self-funded by my company Certimix. Next week I'm meeting investors, so Kickstarter is just an option we are considering.  Q. Do you think having physical bitcoins will help mainstream adoption?  SL: Physical (electronic) bitcoins are much more expensive than banknotes. A dollar bill costs approximately 5 cents to produce in a batch of 10 billion, where a Firmcoin could cost $4 (in 1K batches). So Firmcoins are not ready to replace bills in all context. Nevertheless, if one could manufacture Firmcoins in larger batches, the cost will go down, and also the cost of technology goes down very rapidly over time.  The key for success of Firmcoins is that they are cheap enough to let people pay with them without thinking about the cost of the device. If you're paying 1 BTC, then 0.03 BTC (the cost of a Firmcoin at 100 USD/BTC) is only 3% of the transaction cost, which can be regarded as the fee of an anonymous transaction and ignored.  Nevertheless, there are several possibilities to help people give the Firmcoins away without worries:  - Accept the same amount of empty Firmcoins in return of the payment. For example, if I pay you 100 BTC using 4 Firmcoins of 25 BTC each, you give me back 4 empty Firmcoins to cover the costs of the devices given to you.  - Accept the same amount of a different (cheaper to manufacture) physical device that represents the cost of a Firmcoin. For example, you could receive one bitbill-like note for each Firmcoin given as payment. Or you could receive dollars for the cost of the Firmcoins.  - If the payee has a smartphone connected to the Internet, he can give me back the cost of the Firmcoins used in the off-line transaction using a normal online transaction. Since the Firmware cost is low, the payer does not need to carry a smartphone to verify the transaction and may just trust the payee's smartphone.  So people should like the Firmcoins, but not too much they get attached to them!  Q. When do you expect to ship Firmcoins to customers?  SL: I have no idea. I started the project for fun, and I got a lot of interest immediately. I've been reached by investors without even asking for funds, and still only have a few prototypes to show. I suppose that with hard work and some capital I could start manufacturing in medium volumes in three months.  I'm not in a hurry to go to the market. I want the Firmcoin to stand up against people's expectations. I've applied for patents for some of the functions/methods and physical properties of the Firmcoin so I can have some time to do things well.",NEUTRAL,BTC | CORE,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | CORE,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/08/firmcoin-the-reprogrammable-physical-bitcoin-token-explained,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/167cba51ae07d2eb36c912ffacf07df288b558b6-419x266.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It announced, via Twitter, that instructions had been posted to its website. As users log in, they will find instructions on recovering their funds on the withdraw page.  We reported on the closure in April, when it had come to light that Bitfloor's US bank account had been closed. Its bank issued a check for the balance of the account, which left the company with the task of setting up a new account and dealing with distributing the funds back to all of its users.  The front page of Bitfloor now reads:    2013.07.06      We are pleased to announce that we are ready to start returning USD funds. Please follow the instructions on the withdraw page.    If your account balance is over 3000 USD, you must first open an account with IAFCU and then provide your IAFCU account number.

42397174,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAacMBi,1373290778,HMRC: UK bitcoin exchanges don’t have to register under money laundering regulations,"Bitcoin exchanges operating in the UK do not have to register with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) under money laundering regulations, the government department has revealed.  In a letter to Joel Dalais, director of soon-to-launch exchange FYB-UK, HMRC suggested it was keeping a close eye on bitcoin and said it may decide to change its stance in the future on how the digital currency is regulated.  The letter from HMRC read as follows:    ""With reference to your enquiry at this time there is no requirement to register with HMRC under the Money Laundering regulations, however HMRC recognise that the issuing of Bitcoins represent an emerging development.      We are currently in discussions with HM Treasury concerning this market and whether HMRC will be a Supervisor for this market. HMRC will be watching any developments relating to the Bitcoin market and may change our view, therefore I would suggest that you regularly check our news and update section on our website at www.hmrc.gov.uk/mlr and sign up for our e-mail alert system at www.uktradeinfo.com/AboutUs/Pages/EmailAlertServices.aspx.    If at any time HMRC recognise Bitcoins as a currency you would then have to register straight away without any prior correspondence from HMRC as this would be your responsibility to register should the ruling change regarding Bitcoins under the Money Laundering regulations.""    Dalais, who is also involved in the exchanges FYB-SG in Singapore and Sweden-based FYB-SE (currently in beta), said HMRC’s guidance gives the green light to bitcoin businesses within the UK, especially those operating as exchanges.  ""Regulation will definitely come into play at some time in the future, so it is in the best interest of businesses that think they are transacting as a money services business to still keep anti-money laundering and know-your-customer practices in play so they're prepared for when HMRC does come knocking,"" he added.  Last month, a spokesperson from HMRC told CoinDesk that, while there is no specific regulation relating to digital currency, standard tax rules apply. This means those who receive bitcoin in return for goods and services will have to pay tax on any profits they make.  Meanwhile, in the US, the Bitcoin Foundation recently issued a response to the Cease and Desist order it was sent by the Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) in California, which suggested the foundation was operating as a money transmitter.  The foundation refutes these claims and also challenges the department's view that bitcoin is a payment instrument.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/08/hmrc-uk-bitcoin-exchanges-dont-have-to-register-under-money-laundering-regulations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e4d3b1e676d06cca7615a558912b559bbfb3f016-1000x664.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42422946,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1yuhh,1373281958,Bitcoin 2013 video roundup: Bitcoin is the Wild West,"Excerpt from CalvinAyre.com  At present, the Bitcoin industry is facing the same struggles the online gambling industry faces when it comes to US regulation- it has become a state by state process. Constance Choi, General Counsel of Payward, revealed that she has had conversations with the US Treasury about the tediousness of explaining Bitcoin to all 50 states. Their response? Its up to the industry to survive these barriers of entry. “No special rules are going to be made until we’re big enough to have special rules made for”, she said. According to Choi, the Treasury is not against innovation, but in the meantime we will have to abide by their rules.  Patrick Murck of the Bitcoin Foundation advised that Bitcoin entrepreneurs be wary when entering the US market because they are actually dealing with 49 states as opposed to just one country. As a result of this state-by-state mess, there is a huge opportunity globally for other countries to take the lead. Murck suggested finding “Bitcoin-friendly” countries such as Panama where the barrier to entry isn’t as high. “Later down the line build roads back into the US”, he said.

42397178,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAacMCh,1373271712,Bill-splitting service BillPin adds support for bitcoin,"BillPin  is a new service designed to take the pain out of splitting bills with friends. It launched in February. It now, however, has just added 40 more currencies including bitcoin and beer!  The Singapore-based service can be used on the web, and has apps for Android and iOS. From now on, when users sign in, they will be asked to select their default currency. In most cases, this will be the local fiat currency. However, it is possible to opt for bitcoin too.  If users on your list of balances use different currencies, the app lets you switch those balances to your local currency. Then you can get a clearer idea of what you are owed, and how much you owe to others.  BillPin also state in their blog post that they are increasing the speed of the app, but to expect some ""funky stuff"" along the way too. The latter warning is due to the fact that existing users will be updating their default currency, and so this will affect balances across the BillPin network. The BillPin developers (team Pincho) simply recommend that users ""Just make your changes and give it a day or two to settle down"".  From the looks of the app, all parties of a split bill need to be existing members of the service. Furthermore, BillPin does not handle payments for you. All transactions need to be manually recorded, and so this should be thought of as a social ledger, rather than a payment transfer system.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | WALLET,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/08/bill-splitting-service-billpin-adds-support-for-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/92304dcc228fcec8d76aa7b27e5deb3a431fddc6-2479x1353.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
