42399627,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjufX,1487115357,Ether Prices Just Hit a New 2017 High,"Ether, the digital currency that powers the smart contract-based blockchain platform ethereum, rose to its highest price of the year today.  In total, the cryptocurrency surged close to 20% on digital currency exchange Poloniex against both USDT and BTC during today's session, rising to as much as $13.40 for a gain of 18.7% from the opening price.  Ether enjoyed even stronger gains relative to larger cryptocurrency bitcoin, as ETH/BTC reached 0.0135 BTC, a 19.5% increase for the day.  Analysis shows the combination of a strong pickup in trading volume combined with a highly leveraged market helped intensify gains.  ETH/USD's 24-hour trading trading volume surpassed $40m on CoinMarketCap during the session, a contrast to a high of $8m the day before.  Poloniex data painted a similar picture, as ETH/BTC trading volume reached nearly 50,000 ETH early in the 14th February session after rising to only as much as 16,725 ETH the day before.  One factor that coincided with the rise in ether prices included a decline in the short interest in the ETH/BTC pair, according to data provided by leveraged digital currency trading platform Whaleclub.  While the market for this cryptocurrency pair was 65% short on 13th February, this figure had fallen to 50% on 14th February.  ETH is not a highly liquid market, and this could have helped accelerated the digital currency’s sharp price increases, analysts said.  Another development that may have helped push ether prices higher was a 13th February report indicating that major banks JP Morgan and Banco Santander had joined a still-secretive initiative called Enterprise Ethereum said to focus on the enterprise uses of the ethereum protocol.  Analysts further credited a delayed reaction to the news as a possible impetus for the price increase.

42399610,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjuOo,1487106008,Vitalik Buterin Issues Update on Ethereum's 'Metropolis' Upgrade,"Work on 'Metropolis' – the next scheduled software release for the ethereum blockchain project – continues, according to a new blog post from its creator, Vitalik Buterin.  While absent of any concrete release date, the blog offers a window into the platform's development efforts, as well as details about the changes that could be included in the Metropolis update. Metropolis follows two previous versions of ethereum, 'Homestead' (released last March) and 'Frontier', which debuted in July 2015.  As detailed by CoinDesk in December, ethereum's developer team has largely been looking ahead to future releases, having been stymied by events such as the collapse of The DAO and denial-of-service attacks against the ethereum network.  Buterin said today that those efforts are accelerating.  He wrote:  ""During the last month and a half, the Ethereum Core development and research teams have been building upon the progress made in the last year, and with the specter of last year’s security issues now well behind us, work has [begun] full force on implementing the Metropolis hard fork.""  The post includes a list of proposals likely to be included in Metropolis.  One major plank is the concept of ""abstraction"", embodied in Ethereum Improvement Proposal 86, which aims to cut complexity in the system by shifting some of its foundational rules around security into contracts.  Among other items, Buterin touched on collaborative work being pursued by the ethereum and zcash teams, and indicated that developers are in the process of including a new programming language to complement Solidity, ethereum's smart contracting language.

42399625,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjuac,1487095832,Ethereum IoT Project Wins $100k in Dubai Blockchain Hackathon,"A startup building an ethereum-based platform for IoT applications has won $100,000 at a blockchain hackathon in Dubai.  Project Oaken was awarded the top prize during a presentation at the World Government Summit, a Dubai government-sponsored event focused on smart governance held this week in Dubai.  Unveiled in late November, the Blockchain Virtual GovHack was aimed at promoting blockchain-based solutions for advancing smart city applications. The initiative was organized by AngelHack, with support on the technology side from ethereum startup ConsenSys.  Project Oaken was one of three finalists presented during the event’s awards ceremony. According to the event’s organizers, 131 projects were submitted, encompassing more than 1,000 total participants. In the end, nine were shortlisted. Two other teams – Team Land Registry and Health Blocks – also made the final round.  In its official pitch for the competition, Project Oaken modeled the use of smart contracts to automatically pay for tolls, driving a Tesla as a test vehicle.  As the startup explains:  “The Tesla tells the toll gate that it wants to pay the toll, causing the toll booth to trigger a smart contract transaction. The toll booth takes the raw Tesla data and communicates it the the blockchain in the form of an IDFS hash.”  While the hackathon is concluded, that doesn't mean that Dubai is finished with blockchain.  Last week, government agencies within Dubai announced an expansive trade finance-focused blockchain trial, being conducted in partnership with IBM. Also involved are Banco Santander and NBD Emirates, two banks have that also worked with the tech in the past.  That project – as well as other trials focused on the digitalization of government services – is part of a broader push to explore blockchain within Dubai, as showcased by the government-backed Global Blockchain Council.

42399622,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjuZd,1487087599,Another Central Bank in Africa is Warning About Onecoin,"Uganda’s central bank is warning local residents about Onecoin, a digital currency scheme widely accused of being a scam.  The Bank of Uganda published an advisoryhttps://www.bou.or.ug/bou/media/statements/One-Coin-Digital-Money-operations-in-Uganda.html earlier today which called for consumers to be mindful of the risks of investing in digital currencies. Specifically, the notice highlights the creation of a company called ""One Coin Digital Money"" that has set up shop in Kampala.  According to the central bank, ""whoever deals with 'ONE COIN DIGITAL MONEY' does so at his or her own risk"".  The notice goes on to explain:  ""The company is still in its formative stages but it is aggressively encouraging members to buy digital money and promising very high returns and rewards on [a] 'first-come-first-served' basis.""  Onecoin is a multi-level marketing (MLM) system, through which prospective investors buy packages of ""tokens"" that can be redeemed on a platform said to act as a hub for mining, or the process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain. In a hallmark of the pyramid scheme concept, Onecoin also teases major financial gains for those who can recruit others to invest – a characteristic that has sparked criticism and accusations of being a scam.  The warning represents the latest scrutiny directed toward Onecoin, which has drawn the ire of regulators across Europe, also sparking an investigation by the London police. Nigeria's central bank issued a similar warning last month, and today's missive indicates that financial overseers in Africa are looking at Onecoin more closely.  In addition to Onecoin, the document names bitcoin, XRP, peercoin, namecoin, dogecoin, litecoin, bytecoin, primecoin, and blackcoin as other examples.  The move also comes as regulators and academics in Uganda have set the stage for developing virtual currency regulations.

42399608,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjuMq,1487082005,China's Bitcoin Traders Are Losing Confidence in Exchange Prices,"The decision by China's bitcoin exchanges to freeze withdrawals is impacting the country's over-the-counter (OTC) markets.  As reported by CoinDesk last week, two of China's 'Big Three' bitcoin exchanges abruptly suspended bitcoin withdrawals in response to new pressures from the People's Bank of China, a move that was followed by similar, though less restrictive, policy updates from exchanges across the country.  But while the price was not significantly impacted, traders are reporting that they have had to shift strategies, as they believe exchanges no longer act as a reliable price indicator.  In conversation with CoinDesk, representatives from major OTC firms indicated that they are now largely using the US dollar price (as listed on British Virgin Islands-based Bitfinex) to determine the price of bitcoin.  Zhou Shouji, operator of OTC trading firm FinTech Blockchain Group, for example, said his firm now uses the USD rate, as did OTC trader Zhao Dong, who went so far as to described China's exchanges as ""totally disabled"".  ""Since you can't withdraw, the price is meaningless if you want to trade bitcoin,"" Zhao said, telling CoinDesk:    ""The price on Chinese exchanges is fake price now.""            Traders further indicated that activity is increasingly taking place on peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange platforms including Bitcoinworld and Bitpie, a wallet and P2P service set up by startup Bither.  Those interviewed indicated that they believe such services could become more widely used, especially if further actions are announced by the central bank.  Kong Gao, overseas marketing manager at OTC firm Richfund, described the prevailing sentiment as one of continued uncertainty.  ""I'm just waiting to see what will happen next,"" he told CoinDesk. ""I don't think anyone can predict what the PBOC will impose next.""

42399613,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjuQm,1487079387,Jury Selection Delayed in Bitcoin Exchange Trial,"A federal trial tied to the now-defunct Florida bitcoin exchange Coin.mx has been delayed.  Yesterday, the court was set to begin jury selection for the trial of Yuri Lebedev – one of the co-operators of Coin.mx alongside Anthony Murgio, who plead guilty to three charges early last month – and Trevon Gross, a pastor who was accused of helping Coin.mx and its backers to take control of a New Jersey credit union in exchange for bribes. Gross was originally charged last March.  Now, according to reports, Judge Alison Nathan has delayed jury selection by a day after the prosecution introduced a new witness, who was said to have information related to Gross’s activities.  Judge Nathan ultimately opted not to allow the witness, punting jury selection to 14th February.  Lebedev, along with Murgio, was initially arrested in mid-2015, accused of running an unlicensed money transmission business in Florida. While related court filings don’t explicitly draw the connection, prosecutors have tied Coin.mx’s actions to a broader cybercriminal scheme involving a series of high-profile hacks in the last several years.  The most notable of these was a breach of Wall Street giant JPMorgan Chase, resulting in a data compromise for tens of millions of customer accounts. Prosecutors have also alleged that that Coin.mx functioned as a money conduit for the cybercrime scheme, using the New Jersey credit union – since shuttered by regulators – as a means to discreetly move funds.  It’s not immediately clear when the trial itself will begin. Murgio is expected to face sentencing in June.

42399615,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjuRl,1487075123,Banking Giant Mizuho Invests in Japan's Biggest Bitcoin Exchange,"Japan's largest bitcoin exchange by volume has announced a new round of fundraising.  In a press release today, Tokyo-based Bitflyer revealed it had raised new capital from financial firms including Sumitomo Mitsui, Mizuho Financial Group and Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company. A report by Japan-based news source Nikkei indicated that the funding equalled roughly ¥200m ($1.76m).  According to statements from the startup, the fundraising follows BitFlyer's work with Sumitomo and Mizuho on private blockchain solutions aimed at providing the core infrastructure for enterprise use cases.  Notably, the funding also comes during what could be a period of increasing competition for the startup. As acknowledged in its release, legislation is slated to become law in June that would enable regulated firms to enter Japan's bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets.  As reported by CoinDesk  , the move is expected by many in the blockchain industry to open the doors for existing financial firms to begin offering such services.  Still, BitFlyer is expected to be competitive in the market, boasting more than $35m in funding, the most recent of which was a $27m Series C.    Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in BitFlyer.

42399641,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjueY,1487073649,Hardware Over Hard Forks: How Accenture Plans to End Blockchain's Security Debate,"The ethereal world of blockchain tech is increasingly being tethered to more tangible, saleable solutions.  As major institutions have sought software concepts that rethink or remove bitcoin's proof-of-work mining mechanism, so too have the firms involved with those products needed to seek hardware solutions that provide a similar level of security to their desired distributed ledgers.  Most recently, the $75bn consulting firm Accenture unveiled a patent-pending security layer integrated with a hardware security module (HSM) made by Thales – a global security firm already protecting the passwords and encrypted data of some of the most high-value assets around the world.  While the distributed nature of the blockchain itself is designed to ensure the soundness of each transaction, applications built on the technology and distributed solutions with fewer nodes (and therefore less protection) remain vulnerable, according to Accenture’s general manager, David Treat.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Treat said his firm's decision to integrate with existing, government-certified hardware is about more than just having a new product to sell to existing and future clients. Instead, it's about entering the fray by implementing real-world blockchain solutions.  Treat said:  ""Our focus on building this HSM integration layer is part of a whole innovation campaign that we have right now to think about all the different facets of what it’s going to take to bring blockchain systems out of the PoC and prototype phase and into production.""  Eliminating debate  In Accenture's Thales integration, private keys essential for conducting transactions are stored within nShield hardware certified by the US National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) in conjunction with the Canadian Communications Security Establishment.  Developed in London with support from Accenture’s team in Rome, the security system is initially based on the Hyperledger Fabric platform and integrated with Thales’ nShield HSM, already being used by the French company to protect UK tax payers, Samsung cellphones and fighter jets.  The as-yet unbranded blockchain integration is expected to be formally named later this week, alongside the launch of a new website designed to integrate with any number of distributed ledgers, blockchains and competing HSMs.  Treat positions the hardware as part of blockchain’s natural evolution, as regulators, existing financial infrastructure providers and banks move to capitalize on the faster settlement times and easier auditability of shared, trusted ledgers, but hesitate out of a number of security and privacy concerns.  Instead of storing private keys that are essential to confirming identity within the application layer of the protocol, the Accenture solution is designed to keep them in a physical HSM architecture.  ""It’s eliminating that part of the debate of how secure are the keys,” Treat said. ""It comes as a much simpler answer if you see we are adhering to the high level of standards associated with the current certification of security infrastructure.""  Hardware competition  Exactly how Accenture will market this 'blockchain agnostic' integration layer has yet to be determined, or at least publicized. But, much can be learned by taking a closer look at the burgeoning blockchain hardware ecosystem.  Among the unknowns at Accenture, are whether the integration layer will be sold through a subscription model or flat rate offering. However, the customers Accenture will be marketing to are more certain.  Treat told CoinDesk that customers who already have their own HSM solution will be able to hire Accenture to integrate it to their blockchain, or blockchains, of choice. New customers, on the other hand, or those with a ""heightened need for security"" would go to Thales or another HSM provider to buy their hardware stack ""and come to us to install our integration layer on top of it"".  Accenture distinguishes itself from the recent proliferation of consulting firms offering blockchain services by being among the first to also join the rapidly growing blockchain hardware industry.  So far, blockchain infrastructure providers have tended to lease services for periodic fees, while cryptocurrency companies charge based on transaction size.  For example, IBM currently charges $10,000 a month to give blockchain users high-security access to its HSM network, whereas venture-backed Xapo offers its customers free access to its 'vaults' stored offline and ""deep underground in geographically dispersed locations"", in exchange for charging various fees to move the funds associated with an account.  But perhaps the most informative example of the young industry is Intel’s software guard extensions (SGX) – hardware designed to isolate keys and other valuable information. SGX has been proposed for use in both more general blockchain applications and a cryptocurrency-specific use case.  In each case, concerns over using hardware quickly became apparent.  Last year, when Intel proposed using SGX at the core of its Sawtooth Lake blockchain implementation, it sparked a heated debate over using trusted hardware to run a network with the potential to run without a trust. Then, weeks later, the Initiative For CryptoCurrencies & Contracts (IC3) proposed using SGX to help scale bitcoin, setting off similar disputes.  Pushing the limits  Accenture's David Treat is joined by Thales CTO Jon Geater in arguing that the limits of blockchain aren’t in the technology itself, but in the way it is implemented.  In interview, Treat highlighted exchanges such as Mt Gox and Bitfinex, which were hacked through poor key management practices, as evidence of such concerns.  But Geater, who helped integrate Accenture’s software into his company’s hardware, focused more on potential limitations of smaller private networks when creating more sophisticated assets than cryptocurrency.  Further, for private networks that have fewer nodes than the 5,800 nodes live at any given time on the public bitcoin network, Geater argues the ability to protect each node from a wide variety of potential attack vectors is exponentially more important.  ""When you’ve got a very small population,"" he told CoinDesk, ""some of these threats become much more real, and so having trustworthy hardware underpinning is clearly more valuable for peace of mind, for speed of adoption and for business agility.""  Couple that with concerns Geater has over highly regulated digital assets, and certified hardware becomes essential to widespread industry adoption, he said.  Not everyone agrees, however. The movement to push blockchain security into hardware owned by third parties is part of Accenture’s broader, and controversial, push to make distributed ledgers more appetizing to legacy financial infrastructure providers and other organizations held accountable to regulators.  The 'redactable blockchain'  In December, Accenture published an article in the New York Times relaying its vision for 'redactable blockchains' that, instead of relying on a consensus-driven hard fork like the one experienced by ethereum to undo transactions, relies on the ability to edit their history using highly protected private keys.  While critics have jumped on the idea as contrary to the underlying benefits of a distributed network, Geater argued that blockchain redaction accompanied by certified, secure hardware is the only way to get the current financial leaders to truly buy into the technology.  ""In the real world, you have overrides and you have lawyers. You have disputes, and you need to code all of that kind of process and authority into the system,"" he said.  ""Whereas bitcoin is almost entirely anti-authority and anti-centralization, what Accenture is doing is bringing most of the benefits of that technology, but applying it to cases where businesses do actually have some authority of legal override.""  The debate over whether hardware, hard fork or another solution is more desirable remains unresolved, with pre-emptive solutions around standards also springing up.  But, according to Treat, the ability to edit a blockchain and the hardware to protect the keys to those crucial editing rights are inevitable.  ""A part of our answer in designing solutions,"" he said. ""we would absolutely store the sharded copies of those keys in HSMs as a further ability to allow people to trust that system.”  Geater concluded that more sophisticated implementations of blockchain than cryptocurrency require more imaginitive solutions:  ""That doesn’t translate at all to other use cases; it doesn’t translate as soon as you’re trying to do things like regulatory compliance or multi-way asset trading, rather than coin trading. It doesn’t apply when you’re trying to overlay a real business relationship, and implement it in terms of blockchain, rather than using blockchain itself.""

As CoinDesk reported earlier this month, a proposed new bill would prevent the use distributed ledgers in firearm tracking, with the exception of law-enforcement applications.  The concept, put forward by technologists in the blockchain space, is that such a system could create an immutable history of transactions that records every time a gun is fired, for example.  The proposed bill, HB 2216, has now cleared the Arizona House of Representatives by a 34-25 vote, with one no-vote and no abstentions, and has since moved to the Senate, where it awaits further consideration.  While the Senate is a separate legislative entity, its makeup – with a Republican majority, like the House – perhaps indicates that the measure will continue to garner support among lawmakers.  The advancement of the measure further demonstrates a growing trend within US state legislatures to act on bitcoin and blockchain issues.  Lawmakers in North Dakota and New Hampshire are weighing changes to their respective state statutes. Meanwhile, a concurrent measure in the Arizona legislature focused on blockchain-based smart contracts has also been submitted.
