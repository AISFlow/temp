42377736,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73NM7,1414260115,Bitcoin Book Seeks to Debunk Myth with Math,"The latest book by financial crime journalist and fiction author Jeffrey Robinson is making its way around bitcoin missionaries, mercenaries and visionaries following its release last month.  BitCon: The Naked Truth About Bitcoin is a critical evaluation of the fantasy and fallacy of the dreamers and journalists that brought bitcoin to notoriety. Its reporting covers all manner of bitcoin debate – the currency, the commodity, the technology, the crime, the scandal, the business, the politics, the regulation, the economics – offering the bitcoin skeptics’ usual condemnations of the currency, but backed by numbers.  So when asked for whom the book was written, Robinson said: “I always write for me, and it’s the bitcoin book that I would want to read if I were thinking of spending my money on bitcoins or getting involved.”  He added that the bitcoin media and its darlings “don't justify any of the misinformation, spin or hype, can’t back it up with facts, and are doing it only to pump up the price of their own holdings. I think that needs somebody to scream, yell and kick and say ‘this is wrong, and don't believe it’.”  Robinson is bullish on the block chain, though – something he repeatedly emphasized, as he does in the book, is a distinct entity from the digital currency:  “It’s a tech buy, not a commodities buy, because the technology is very exciting and the technology is going to happen. The block chain is the future, but not necessarily with bitcoin.”  Though many believe bitcoin as a currency is essential to the viability of the block chain (without the incentive of a bitcoin reward, miners wouldn't work to maintain the block chain ledger), Robinson thinks the block chain can survive on its own, and claims to know of a number of Silicon Valley startups currently working to give the block chain independence from bitcoin as a currency.  Bragging rights  Robinson said that when bitcoin reached its highest-ever market cap, $1,147 last December, it was the direct result of a pump and dump scheme and a distant second to the Uzbekistani som.  “Nobody cares about this stuff, don’t tell me it’s changing the world,” he said. “The block chain technology may, and I believe will. The currency will not be part of it.”  That’s because bitcoin, “the pretend currency”, is illogical, he said, and despite a year of his research that included attending meetups, hearings and conversing with bitcoin’s supposed champions, he struggles to find a problem in the developed or developing worlds that it can solve.  He said:  “It solves no problem. It exists, but it’s a solution in search of a problem.”  When asked if he allows for the fact that he might be wrong about the digital currency bitcoin, he said: “I do not allow for the fact that the numbers are wrong. The numbers are right.”  For example, he pointed to ambiguous figures estimating 5.8 million wallet users as of this July. With just over 13 million bitcoins in circulation, each of these wallets should hold about 2.25 BTC on average, but this wouldn’t account for the unused, empty wallets holding not more than 1 satoshi.  Citing guesstimates of 3,000–20,000 bitcoin merchants worldwide in mid-2013, Robinson pointed out that if the 2014 figure of 63,000 merchants is true, that means that adoption has more than tripled in one year. Transaction volume, however, did not have the same spike.  “The transactions didn't triple, they remained the same,” he said. “The actual buying and selling of services with bitcoin has remained stagnant for 15 months. So now you’ve got 63,000 businesses chasing the same amount of money that the 3,000 were chasing.”  Math and marketing  For merchants, bitcoin has been a valuable marketing tool more than anything else, Robinson said – though not by much.  Overstock  sales hit $130,000 in bitcoin on its first day accepting the currency.  He said:  “$2m minus $130,000 divided by the number of days [it took him to get to $2m] – that’s $7,000 a day … hockey stick, boom, sales crash. And it’s the same story with every single business that’s said ‘we will allow you to pay in bitcoin’.”  He talked of the emotional, cultish aspect to the bitcoin “faithful” that so highly regard people like Overstock CEO and chairman Patrick Byrne and other major executives making the bitcoin acceptance announcement.  “What happens is when you announce ‘we’ll accept bitcoin’ … the faithful say ‘he’s supporting us, we’ll support him’,” he said. “And they love Patrick Byrne, they would deify him.”  Robinson spoke highly of Byrne, calling him a very brilliant man, but also a great marketer, maintaining based on research and previous conversaions with him that he was not a “bitcoin fan” until he realized the way it could impact his business.  He added:  “Should every company on the planet have a system to accept payments through Coinbase or someplace in bitcoins, as long as they don’t have to touch the bitcoins? Maybe. Is it good for bitcoin? No, because it’s not an endorsement of bitcoin it’s an endorsement of marketing.”  On money laundering  Robinson’s expertise in investigating financial crime and fraud leads him to believe that bitcoin is a bad way to launder money. He argued that because it doesn’t disguise the money as something else and instead just moves it, and the fact that it can be traced back to its criminal origins, bitcoin isn't the best laundering tool.  “It’s a great way to move capital flight money, it’s a great way to move tax evasion money, but it’s not a great way to launder money,” he said.  Robinson has authored more than 30 books including The Laundrymen: Inside Money Laundering, The World's Third Largest Business; The Merger: The Conglomeration of International Organized Crime; and The Sink: Crime, Terror, and Dirty Money in the Offshore World.  Block chain bull  BitCon: The Naked Truth About Bitcoin takes readers through the story of bitcoin, but perhaps the real conversation should be about the block chain. Robinson said that nearly all of the best journalistic pieces on bitcoin acknowledge that “the political, libertarian, wacko, delusional view should be completely disregarded and that the currency is a very secondary story”.  “All of these people that say that the dollar is trembling at the feet of bitcoin are getting in the way of the real story,"" he said. ""The real story is the technology – the pretend currency traded as a pretend commodity is a side issue that will go away.”  He predicts that in an increasingly and soon to be completely digital world, no one will need bitcoin; that once all businesses come online and implement the block chain to allow easier payments in dollars, pounds, euros, yen and pesos, no one will need bitcoin.  He said:  “The odds of competition coming into the marketplace creating a course of least resistance that has nothing to do with bitcoin but does have to do with digital currencies means that in five years' time no one’s going to need bitcoin the pretend currency. They’re going to love the block chain but they won’t need this pretend currency.”  He added that every company right now should be looking into the block chain technology and exploring its potential benefits for their customers.  “A lot of people are going to make humongous fortunes with the block chain technology,” he concluded. “It’s been changed 70% in the last five years? It’ll be changed 170% in the next five years, and one of the changes will be the separation of the block chain from the pretend currency.”  Image via Amazon",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/25/bitcoin-book-seeks-to-debunk-myth-with-math,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b3988245e1316e4d98cab5800de855f80d285622-1456x801.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377735,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73NKr,1414251128,Could Bitcoin Become a Policy Issue for US Congress?,"Notwithstanding funding to combat notorious international terrorist group ISIL, recent US Congresses have been some of the least productive in the country's history, and the 113th Congress has been no different.  The sheer number of policy-related issues tabled since January 2013 has put the current Congress on pace to become the least productive in the nation's history, rivaling the 112th Congress in how few laws it could ultimately pass.  With so many issues dividing American legislators, it may be natural for bitcoin enthusiasts to wonder when the technology will become an issue in the nation's capital. Further, if it does hit this inflection point, questions remain about whether bitcoin could achieve bipartisan support or how much resistance the digital currency would face.  Chris David, founder of CoinVox, a startup helping political fundraisers more effectively use bitcoin, believes the digital currency may soon become an issue that could unite US politicians, given the technology's potential applications to help expand financial access.  David told CoinDesk:  “Bitcoin and block chain technology, if allowed to evolve naturally, hold the potential to shift society away from the zero-sum politics of the past. “  The cost of Congressional inaction  One potential byproduct of Congressional inaction on bitcoin might be that other government agencies start taking action to address their respective areas of oversight. There is the risk that different agencies could also disagree on how to treat bitcoin, and there’s good reason for that, since it has many different technical aspects.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has, understandably, had to provide guidance on how to report bitcoin for tax purposes, treating it like property instead of currency. Other agencies like the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have also weighed in on the subject of regulating bitcoin, though it has not entered the debate as to whether bitcoin is a currency or commodity.  Dan Backer, founder of a political action committee named BitPAC, told CoinDesk that he predicts at least one more agency could jump into the bitcoin regulatory fray:  “The [Securities and Exchange Commission] SEC is probably going to weigh in at some point. But ultimately the different ways agencies will want to deal with the issue will lead to Congress providing clear guidance that is uniform.”  This notion highlights why congressional decisions will, at some point, need to be made on how bitcoin should be interpreted.  “Either it is money, or it is a thing, or it is a commodity – or an equity. Whatever it is, it needs to be definable in order for agencies to understand how to deal with it,” said Backer.  Democrat, Republican or Libertarian?  There have already been some committee discussions in Congress about bitcoin, most recently on small business use of the digital currency. But even so, many in Congress have not had an actual experience with the digital currency.  For the time being, this means there is still a divide between politicians who understand bitcoin and those who think it is a threat to consumers.  BitPAC recently aimed to change this by sending bitcoin paper wallets to eight well-known members of Congress.  “You look at Jared Polis from Colorado – he is a Democrat, and he’s exceptional on this issue,” said Backer. “But on the flip side I think Joe Manchin from West Virginia [a Democrat] – I think if you talk about bitcoin mining with him he thinks there’s some guys with axes down in the mines.""  Of course, there's also the question of which party is most likely to make bitcoin a part of its financial platform.  Bitcoin has long been considered a Libertarian-leaning technology because of its free market properties, though certain state-level Republican organisations have embraced the technology too.  The Libertarian party’s platform includes allowing currencies to freely float untethered from the control of central banking – which is similar to how bitcoin behaves right now.  “I think Libertarian legislators, they tend to like [bitcoin] a lot more,” Backer said.  Still, the Libertarian party and its ideals, while gaining support in recent polls, appeals to just under one-quarter of the overall electorate, research shows.  Point of action  Still, while the idea that Congress might step in to allow bitcoin innovation to flourish (or at least provide clarity about its legal status) is appealing to those interested in the technology, experts believe such action is unlikely for now.  David Levinthal, a senior political reporter for The Center for Public Integrity, believes it might require national media headlines before Congress might take up the issue of bitcoin more specifically.  Levinthal said:  “For bitcoin to leapfrog other pressing congressional issues — not the least of which are military action overseas, the broader economy and November’s election — it’d likely take a monumental problem, such as a scandal involving bitcoin that they simply couldn’t ignore.”  However, politicians pay attention to money, and with few exceptions, most people still donate to campaigns in US dollars. This may cause bitcoin to take a backseat, at least for now.  Cash is still king, according to Levinthal:  “Most political donors deal only in traditional currency, so it serves to reason that most political donations are going to be made in cash.”  Campaign finance issues aside, in the end, US politicians may ultimately make decisions on how to properly label bitcoin and subsequent digital currencies. None of this matters, however, until there is a reason for members of Congress to act.  The bitcoin community showing support for Congress may be the best impetus for action, rather than waiting for an undesirable event to force policy.  “The community needs to create a critical mass of support in the political realm for embracing block chain technology. The arguments are easy to make, we just need to make them in a way that will be heard and acted upon,” added CoinVox’s David.

42377740,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73NTf,1414242656,"Crypto 2.0 Roundup: Bits of Bullion, a Foundation for Counterparty and Medici Goes to Washington","The last few weeks have seen the fruition of a number of highly anticipated crypto 2.0 firsts.  This has included the launch of the first token-powered social messaging service, the release of the first Android app for colored coins and the debut of the first class of startups on crypto 2.0-powered crowdfunding platform Swarm.  The updates provide the latest evidence that innovators are beginning to translate the sometimes hard-to-parse theories and technical arguments underlying crypto 2.0 applications of block chain technology into products that are attracting investment and early adopters.  Medici readies for regulatory hurdles  Perhaps the most high-profile development in the crypto 2.0 world to date took place this October, when Overstock hired Counterparty developers Robby Dermody and Evan Wagner to work on a new decentralized stock exchange. Called Medici, the ambitious effort seeks to provide companies with a way to go public without using traditional stock exchanges.  Beyond developing new technology, however, the effort will also require substantial legal power. That's where Washington, DC-based law firm Perkins Coie will seek to provide its expertise.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Perkins Coie senior counsel Jacob Farber stopped short on providing specific details of his client's work, but did put into perspective the goals his firm hopes to achieve as it seeks to engage regulators about the project.  Specifically, Perkins Coie will aim to engage the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the federal agency responsible for overseeing and enforcing federal securities law. Farber indicated that while there are no rules that he believes prevent a project like Medici from being launched, the project will need approval from the SEC and the US Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) to serve US customers.  ""There's hard work to be done, not only do you have to be able to prove that you can meet all the regulatory requirements, but you have to prove that it's going to work and be safe for investors,"" Farber said. ""On the other hand, we're optimistic about our ability to make those showings and to get approval.""  Farber framed the steps as being part of Medici's conservative approach to launching in the US market, which he aimed to contrast against other past coin offerings that have sought to raise funds from investors for crypto 2.0 projects.  In an indication of perhaps how he will seek to frame the conversation with regulators, Farber went on to state the efficiencies that can result from using block chain technology as part of a stock exchange, as well as the players along the traditional value chain the innovation could eliminate.  However, those hoping to purchase shares of Overstock or another company on the Medici platform may not be able to do so anytime soon.  ""I think it's safe to say we're looking at months, not days or weeks, but I hope this process doesn't drag out into years,"" Farber concluded.  Counterparty matures with foundation launch  In line with the industry sector's continuing bid for legitimacy, its arguable market leader Counterparty also announced this week that it would seek to establish a non-profit Counterparty Foundation to support the open-source project's continued growth.  In an interview, Counterparty chief architect Adam Krellenstein noted that he hopes the organisation will serve as evidence of the project's maturity, and as a sign to the wider crypto community that Counterparty is ready to provide a stable foundation and clear direction to serious, well-funded projects.  Krellenstein noted that the number of significant ventures launched on Counterparty in recent weeks including gold-to-bitcoin exchange DigitalTangible and crowdfunding platforms like Koinify and Swarm.  ""We have relatively serious people with long-term plans on how they're going to use Counterparty and they want to ensure there will be a stable development for the future of the protocol,"" Krellenstein explained. ""It's one thing to say, trust in the three of us who created the protocol, and its another thing to have this legal entity they can count on to represent their interests in an accountable fashion.""  While he was critical of the Bitcoin Foundation, Krellenstein said that such organisations have provided stable leadership for community projects in the past, noting the work done by the Wikimedia foundation, the non-profit organization that manages Wikipedia.  Krellenstein went on to state that investors who hold XCP, the protocol's native currency, will also have a stake in the direction of the foundation. The Counterparty Foundation, he said, will have a community seat elected by XCP holders in a proof of stake vote.  As for when the elections will be held, Krellenstein was less certain, saying that the vote could happen in a ""few months"".  A colored coin solution for gold trading  Yet another trend in crypto 2.0 has been the increase in precious metals platforms seeking to use cryptographic tokens as a way to enable online asset trading.  UK-based Bullion Bitcoin announced this week that it had launched Bits of Bullion, a new colored coin offering that lets users trade gold bullion over the block chain using the CoinSpark platform. Bullion Bitcoin will also act as a market maker, buying back colored coins tokens in order to encourage market trust in the experimental product.  By using colored coins, which add unique identifiers to bitcoins, rather than crypto 2.0 protocols to enable asset transmission, Bullion Bitcoin stands in contrast to past efforts like DigitalTangible, which uses the Counterparty and NXT protocols.  ""I wanted to try to keep it on the bitcoin block chain because the bitcoin block chain is so robust and so widespread, so I wanted to make it as close to spending bitcoin as possible,"" Bullion Bitcoin owner Adam Cleary told CoinDesk. ""I think an intermediate protocol or one where you require an intermediate altcoin, seems to add another layer of complexity between the user and the product.""  Cleary cited the ease of use provided by CoinSpark's SparkBit wallet as the reason he chose the relatively new platform for the project over other alternatives like Coinprism.  ""You need to put people on a rail, saying this is a colored coin transaction, you can only send it if the recipient address is a colored coin address,"" Cleary said. ""SparkBit achieves that, whereas Coinprism doesn't achieve that.""  For now, however, Bits of Bullion will only be available to users outside the US due to the company's lingering concerns about how regulators may view such applications of the new technology.
