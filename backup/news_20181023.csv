42402076,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3Kij,1540330227,New Stablecoin Tied to Australian Dollar Is Launching on Stellar's Blockchain,"A new stablecoin is launching on the Stellar blockchain that's designed to hold its value with the Australian dollar (AUD) and is being pitched for consumer and business uses.  Announced Tuesday at the Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas, Novatti Group, an Australian online payments processor, will issue the Novatti AUD Utility Token beginning on November 19. The token will be backed 1-for-1 with AUD held in a trust.  While traditionally, stablecoins have been a tool for cryptocurrency traders to move money quickly between exchanges, Novatti envisions its token being used for more common use cases, like remittances or purchases.  Peter Cook, Novatti's managing director, told CoinDesk:  ""We think that people will use them [stablecoins] to help purchase goods from Australian enterprises. And we think that will also use them for the payment of bills or for services inside of Australia.""  Novatti, a licensed payments distributor, processes payments for such clients as Vox Telecom in Europe and the South African remittance provider MoniSend. Cook said several institutions beyond Novatti's clientele have reached out to express interest in the upcoming token because using it requires a compliant know-your-customer identity check.  ""We will be working with licensed money service businesses, banks and enterprises, who want access to digital assets,"" Cook said, declining to name which banks at this stage. ""Novatti is a publicly listed company, it's listed on the Australian stock exchange. So that should give [users] a lot of trust.""  The news comes as competition among stablecoins heats up, with several new U.S. dollar-pegged tokens launching this year, including Circle's USD//Coin (USDC), TrustToken's TrueUSD (TUSD), Paxos' Paxos Standard Dollar (PAX) and the Winklevoss brothers' Gemini Dollar (GUSD).  All eyes have been on this niche for the last week, since the well-known stablecoin tether (USDT) fell below $1 and a number of exchanges quickly listed alternatives. Most recently, Coinbase said on Tuesday it will support the USDC, the exchange's first stablecoin.  New momentum  Indeed, Lisa Nestor, director of partnerships at the Stellar Development Foundation, told CoinDesk that Stellar already supports at least 10 stablecoins, including USD Anchor, created by startup Stronghold with help from IBM.  Requests continue to pour in for Stellar to support new fiat-pegged options (known in the Stellar community as anchors), she said.  ""There are network effects here,"" Nestor said. ""It took us almost a year to get our first two currency anchors on the network. But then each time we add another one, it makes it easier to add one more.""  But the motivation to create these assets is also shifting, she said. ""I think there was tension in the crypto marketplace, and that drove many of the earlier stablecoins. But we also see continued adoption and growth in the payments space.""  Despite the recent fluctuations in prices (besides tether breaking the buck, other stablecoins have surged above $1 in the last week), some believe stablecoins can offer faster and less expensive ways to send remittances.  ""For example in Venezuela, even sending money through the banks gets exchanged at a horrible rate,"" Venezuelan-born stablecoin advocate León Markovitz told CoinDesk. However, Markovitz quickly added that crypto startups can't ""fix a country's economy on their own.""  Novatti's token will be the first AUD-pegged crypto asset on Stellar, but not the first on the market. In September, the Australian exchange Bit Trade announced it was working with the employment platform Emparta to launch a stablecoin in 2019 so employers can pay Emparta users with cryptocurrency.

42402062,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3KXu,1540323588,Coinbase Approved to Offer Crypto Custody Services,"Coinbase has received approval from New York regulators to form a qualified custodial firm for cryptocurrencies.  The New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) said Tuesday that it granted Coinbase's application to create the Coinbase Custody Trust Company LLC, as well as approving the Coinbase Trust to offer custody services for bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum, ethereum classic, litecoin and XRP.  Notably, while Coinbase already allows customers to buy, sell or trade the first five of those cryptocurrencies, it does not currently offer XRP on any of its trading platforms.  In a statement, Coinbase COO and president Asiff Hirji praised the move, noting that the NYDFS has been ""a strong advocate"" for the ""responsible growth of the cryptocurrency industry.""  He added:  ""The New York State Limited Purpose Trust charter, which now enables Coinbase Custody to act as a Qualified Custodian for crypto assets, builds on our unparalleled success as a crypto custodian while holding the company to the same exacting fiduciary standards and oversight of other, mature financial institutions operating in New York.""  The news comes as a number of other cryptocurrency startups gain regulatory approval to offer custody services, including BitGo, Northern Trust and Prime Trust, among others.  Coinbase has been looking for regulatory approval for a number of other products as well. In June, the company announced it was seeking a broker-dealer license, an alternative trading system license and a registered investment advisor license through the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  Should the exchange receive approval for these licenses, it will be cleared to offer blockchain-based securities products, Hirji said at the time.

42402079,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3Kmf,1540319440,Bitfinex Is Publishing Data for a Tether Market That Doesn't Exist,"Pop over to CoinMarketCap and check Bitfinex's page.  You'll see that the trading pair with the second-highest volume on the exchange over the past 24 hours – nearly $48 million at the time of writing – is USDT/USD: the tether stablecoin, which aims for parity with the U.S. dollar, and the U.S. dollar itself.  From this data point, you could be forgiven for concluding that Bitfinex's customers trade huge quantities of tethers for dollars, and vice-versa – more than they trade ether, XRP and EOS combined for dollars.  But you'd be wrong.  According to a Bitfinex spokesperson, the exchange does not offer a USDT/USD trading pair, and no such pair is shown on Bitfinex's site. Customers can deposit and withdraw both dollars and tethers at Bitfinex, meaning that it is possible to transfer one for the other through the exchange, but this process is far slower and more involved than placing a trade on the exchange.  If there's no USDT/USD trading on Bitfinex, then, why does the pair appear on CoinMarketCap – easily the most-visited aggregator of cryptocurrency data, according to Amazon's Alexa rankings?  The question is more than an academic curiosity, given that Bitfinex shares common owners and managers with Tether Ltd., the entity that issues USDT, and that the stablecoin is under increased scrutiny since losing its parity with the dollar more than a week ago.  According to Carylyne Chan, CoinMarketCap's global head of marketing, the data comes from Bitfinex's own public application program interface (API), which feeds exchange data to outside applications. Here is the API link Chan provided for the volume data point.  $48 million of what?  Chan made it clear that CoinMarketCap is as confused as anyone about the meaning of the non-trading pair.  ""With this endpoint, as with others on the site, we try to represent all the pairs that the exchange offers in their API,"" she told CoinDesk, adding, ""we are continuing to follow up with our contacts at Bitfinex to have them clarify exactly what this endpoint represents, as you asked, but they have not responded to multiple direct requests from our team members.""  In particular, it is unclear what the ""volume"" data point represents for the apparently non-existent trading pair.  In an earlier email, Bitfinex's head of marketing, Kasper Rasmussen, told CoinDesk, ""We do not have a direct USD/USDT pair on Bitfinex so I believe it represents deposits/withdrawals of some kind.""  He added that ""USDT is only used as a transport layer on Bitfinex,"" meaning that it can be withdrawn more quickly than fiat and deposited more simply on other exchanges. Dollar trading pairs on Bitfinex, he continued, refer to U.S. dollars and not tethers.  Following the publication of this article, Rasmussen emailed CoinDesk to explain that the USDT/USD pair ""tracks deposits and withdrawals to the following wallet.""  He added:  ""CoinMarketCap displaying a pair does not equate to Bitfinex publicising data that doesn't exist. CoinMarketCap track our API's and them displaying this pair is not something which we have control over, nor is it something we have pushed for.""  Affecting USDT price?  Stepping back, few exchanges offer direct trading between tethers and U.S. dollars.  Kraken is one example; tether flooded onto the exchange last week after the USDT peg to the dollar broke amid worries about the issuer's access to banking services. Bittrex, which did not see a similar influx of tethers, also offers the trading pair.  Given the relative scarcity of options for direct tether-to-dollar trading, it is fair to ask if the data from Bitfinex would have a distorting effect on the composite price displayed on CoinMarketCap.  The USDT/USD exchange rate shown by Bitfinex's API has consistently been $1.00, even since the peg broke. On Kraken, by contrast, tether's price briefly fell as low as $0.85. It has yet to fully recover, trading at $0.972 on the exchange late Tuesday and $0.985 in CoinMarketCap's aggregated calculation.  However, Luke Wagman, chief evangelist at CoinMarketCap, said there has been no ""noticeable effect"" on the aggregate tether price.  ""The price we display is a volume-weighted average,"" he explained, whereas the mysterious Bitfinex USD/USDT market ""contributes less than 2% to the average.""  As for whether the site plans to adjust or remove the data point, Chan said CoinMarketCap ""will have a better idea about the exact steps to be taken"" when the Bitfinex team responds to its inquiries.

42402074,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3Ken,1540317616,Oxfam in Sri Lanka Will Use Ethereum to Deliver Microinsurance,"Oxfam in Sri Lanka, part of the non-profit group focused on alleviating global poverty, has teamed up with blockchain startup Etherisc to help bring affordable insurance to paddy rice farmers.  The tie-up between Etherisc, which applies the ethereum public blockchain to the world of insurance, and Oxfam in Sri Lanka was announced Tuesday at CoinDesk's first ""Blockchain for Social Good"" event in London.  So-called ""microinsurance"" is often defined as coverage for people on very low incomes. Using a blockchain to program in the conditions under which a payout will automatically be made (typically adverse weather conditions or other types of catastrophe), removes much of the distribution and operational costs which have made microinsurance unsustainable in many cases.  Etherisc's blockchain solution is being applied to an existing weather index insurance product supported by Oxfam in Sri Lanka, said Michiel Berende, the startup's inclusive insurance lead.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We are tapping into the existing distribution channels that Oxfam has, and looking at how blockchain can lower costs and increase efficiencies and make it easier for many more farmers to get access to this product  Bojan Kolundzija, the country director for Oxfam in Sri Lanka, said the charity has been working for several years to establish a solid base to support farmers in the region.  ""We are excited to work towards the expansion of this innovative program with the help of blockchain technology and focused insurance industry experience from our partners Etherisc,"" he said.  Etherisc and Oxfam are also working on the Sri Lanka project with one of the world's largest insurance brokers, which the startup said it was not yet authorized to identify.  New value chains  Automating insurance coverage on a blockchain is the first phase, which will make it much easier for insurance companies to reach large groups of small-scale farmers, said Berende.  The second phase of the project will seek to leverage the trust-minimizing, transparent attributes of blockchains to reconfigure the agricultural value chain, allowing large food producers, for example, to play a supporting role.  ""We want to explore where we can bring in the large multinationals to see how they can support the risks of small-scale farmers,"" said Berende, who has spent a number of years working on grant-funded schemes with small-scale farmers in India and other emerging economies in the world.  One way to attract the participation of companies further up the supply chain, as well as aid organizations, is through the use of blockchain-based risk pools, a way of holding funds within a smart contract which ensures money will only be spent when specific, pre-defined requirements are met.  This could be about risk prevention or it could be a way to ensure certain types of fertilizers are applied or be used to buy seeds, said Berende, highlighting capabilities that could benefit aid organizations the world over.  ""Now we have ways that we can be certain money will be spent the way it's supposed to be spent and always reach the location it should reach,"" he said.

42402070,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3Kfm,1540315852,CoinMarketCap Hits a New All-Time High (But Not for Price),"It's been almost a year since bitcoin traded near $20,000, but that isn't stopping innovation in the market from reaching other kinds of all-time highs.  In fact, according to CoinMarketCap, the leading provider of cryptocurrency data, there's never been more cryptocurrencies in existence than now. Launched in 2013, CoinMarketCap listed its 2,000th crypto asset this month with the addition of Labh Coin (LABH).  The milestone officially passed on October 3, there are now 2,112 cryptocurrencies tracked by the data site, the most trafficked according to data from Alexa.com. Data from the company shows a 3,000 percent increase in the number of cryptocurrencies on the website since it tracked just 66 assets in 2013.  According to current figures, the site averages 422 newly listed cryptocurrencies per year which could be broken down to nearly 8 per week.The explosive creation of cryptocurrencies is surprising to many people, but not all.  In fact, the founder of CoinMarketCap, Brandon Chez, told CoinDesk he anticipated the growth early on, although the reality of the situation has become a sight to behold.  He explained:  ""It was apparent that the idea of cryptocurrencies wasn't going away, especially being part of the emerging community that rallied around the promise of what a world with cryptocurrencies would look like. I did imagine at the start that it would reach this number in the near future, but it's still quite amazing to see it finally come to fruition.""  But, what does it mean?  To Chez, the meaning of the rise in the number of cryptocurrencies is quite clear - the demand for secure representation of value still exceeds the number of preferred options.  ""This is something that cryptocurrencies and related technology excel at, so the crypto industry will definitely also benefit from this rise,"" he said.  After nearly a year of cryptocurrency price declines in what history will remember as ""the infamous 2018 bear market,"" one has to wonder if the poor market conditions will take a toll on the rate of cryptocurrency creation. Chez believes this to already be the case, an effect he calls asset creation ""fatigue.""  ""I think the industry is fatigued with new asset creation right now in the bear market, especially since ICO prevalence has died down.""  Much like time, though, bull markets seem to heal all wounds. Chez remains optimistic about the industry, envisioning the positive impact a bull market in 2019 could have on new projects.  ""Assuming a bull market in 2019, I expect token creation to speed back up as teams are willing to pour more capital into new projects as their existing crypto portfolios appreciate in value.""  Market Cap  The rise in one of the site's featured metrics, total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, is perhaps even more staggering that the number of assets created.  According to historical data provided from the CoinMarketCap, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies aggregated from just seven listed assets on April 28th, 2013 (its first month in business) was just shy of $1.6 billion.  That number today represents over $200 billion and a more than 13,000 percent increase since 2013. It should be noted the all-time high in total market capitalization of roughly $830 – set last January – represented an astounding growth percentage of 55,000 percent.  CoinMarketCap doesn't list every cryptocurrency in existence, however, so some competing websites with different listing criteria may provide data for many more. For example, CoinGecko is closing in on 3,000 listed cryptocurrencies with 2,982 at the time of writing.  According to CoinMarketCap's FAQ page, each listing must adhere to a few requirements.  Each asset must ""be a cryptocurrency or crypto token on a public exchange with an API that reports the last traded price and the last 24-hour trading volume."" Further, each ""must have a non-zero trading volume on at least one supported exchange so a price can be determined, and for market cap ranking, an accurate circulating supply figure is required.""  While the listing criteria remain the same, Chez does tend to identify different themes among the listed cryptocurrencies per year. When asked about the types of assets listed now versus years past, Chez simply answered ""2018: security tokens.""

The Denmark-based startup, Sepior, announced in a press release Monday that SBI has licensed its proprietary ""threshold signature"" wallet technology for integration with its VCTRADE exchange to secure ""on-line contents and transactions.""  VCTRADE was launched in June by SBI Holdings' subsidiary SBI Virtual Currencies to become Japan's first bank-backed, government-licensed cryptocurrency exchange.  Sepior said its threshold technology uses signatures based on multiparty computation – a cryptographic method that allows a secret to be shared between different parties without revealing the secret – to provide a high level of wallet security.  Yoshitaka Kitao, representative director, president and CEO of SBI Holdings, said in the release:  ""After extensive investigation, our security research team determined threshold signatures based on multiparty computation (MPC) offered our desired level of security, performance, and scalability needed to manage transactions for our growing SBI Virtual Currencies customer base.""  Saying that the ""vast majority"" of crypto hacks since 2014 were down to poor key security, Sepior claimed that its wallet technology ""eliminates the need for any device or entity to possess the entire private key at any time, making it effectively impossible for an attack to result in key theft.""  If we need reminding why wallet security is so important, Japan lost a massive 60.503 billion yen (around $540 million) worth of cryptocurrency in the first six months of 2018, according to a report from country's National Police Agency (NPA).

42402063,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3KZs,1540303212,Australian Government Agency Says Blockchain 'Interesting' But Hyped,"The Australian government agency dedicated to streamlining the country's IT operations has called blockchain ""interesting,"" but said it is hyped by firms working with the tech.  The chief digital officer of the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA), Peter Alexander, indicated the view was arrived at after the organization received AU$700,000 (about US$500,000) from the government in May to explore blockchain applications within government services.  ""Blockchain: Interesting technology but early on in its development, it's kind of at the top of a hype cycle,"" Alexander said at a parliamentary committee meeting on Tuesday, as reported by ZDNet.  Alexander was further quoted as saying that most of the hype comes from companies seeking to make profits in the space.  He added:  ""It's not that we don't trust any of the vendors – that would be an unfair characterization – we trust the vendors, but note that the motivation is generally sales and making revenue.""  Standardization is also an area that needs to be addressed to make possible use cases of blockchain to more appealing, he continued, saying that, ""for every use of blockchain you would consider today, there is a better technology.""  A number of other government agencies in Australia have recently moved to study blockchain use cases.  For instance, in May, Australia's Department of Home Affairs revealed a plan to investigate blockchain's potential to bring about secure and transparent international trade and supply chain management.  The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) is also looking into the settlement of insurance payments for citizens with disabilities using blockchain– a project being conducted with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.  And Australia's New South Wales (NSW) government's blockchain experiments cover the digitization of all property transactions and driver's license digitization program.  Perhaps most notably, CSIRO said in late August that its research arm, Data61, is working with law firm Herbert Smith Freehills and IBM to conduct a pilot for a new system called the Australian National Blockchain (ANB). The nation-wide platform would allow businesses to carry out transactions based on smart legal contracts, it said at the time.

42402080,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3Kkh,1540299607,"Yes, This Wu-Tang Clan-Themed Cryptocurrency Is Actually Happening","Months after its debut, the cryptocurrency being launched by the estate of the late Wu-Tang Clan member Ol' Dirty Bastard (ODB) is moving ahead – starting with a public pre-sale that begins this week.  Back in March, performing artist Young Dirty – ODB's son, whose real name is Barson Jones – spoke to media outlets about the plan to create a fan-centric cryptocurrency, built on top of the TAO blockchain network and traded on the AltMarket exchange (which is hosting the pre-sale).  And perhaps unlike other cryptocurrencies with celebrity backing – an area that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has taken a stern tone toward – those behind ODBCoin say they moved carefully toward launch.  ""We had to take the time out to get everything correct,"" Young Dirty said in an interview.  Bryce Weiner, AltMarket's CEO, described ODBCoin as ""merchandise, like a T-shirt, which makes it a commodity"" in the eyes of U.S. regulators.  The idea is that ODBCoin (formerly known as Dirty Coin) will be the first of a planned series of artist-branded cryptos developed and distributed. Rather than serving as vehicles for investment, the tokens are intended to act as a kind of incentive for fans of artists like Young Dirty, allowing them to be spent at shows or on merchandise.  The use of blockchain as part of consumer inventive schemes has been explored in the past by numerous companies, including American Express and Singapore Airlines, among others.  But the closest analogue is perhaps a loyalty project involving IBM and China UnionPay, which back in 2016 unveiled a proof-of-concept that sought to make incentive points freely tradeable between users. It's that sort of commodification that the ODBCoin's creators are betting would be adopted – and indeed, embraced – by an artist's fanbase.  ""It's a great way to connect with fans and reward them for their interest. I look forward to delivering even more music that would make Dad proud,"" Young Dirty explained.  Ultimately, the goal is for ODBCoin to pave the way for other artists to create similar tokens, with Weiner saying, ""We will be announcing our next project at the conclusion of this sale.""  ""We are quite proud of the response from the music industry and we look forward becoming home to the biggest names in music,"" Weiner told CoinDesk.

42402084,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3Kod,1540292471,Bitcoin Price Stuck at $6.4K But Eyes Gains Against Altcoins,"Bitcoin (BTC) is again lacking clear directional bias, but may soon pick up a strong bid against ethereum and other altcoins, according to intermarket analysis.  The leading cryptocurrency is now trading in sideways around $6,400 (price as per Coinbase) for the eighth day running, and is struggling to find buyers – despite having charted a bullish inverted hammer last week near the key support of $6,000.  While the absence of a positive follow-through to last week's bullish pattern is a slight cause for concern, it is still too early to adopt the bearish view because prices are holding well above the strong 21-month exponential moving average (EMA) support of $6,121.  Further, BTC is still trapped in a narrow range of $6,360 and $6,480. Hence, the immediate outlook remains neutral.  However, BTC could shine against ETH and other altcoins as the ETH/BTC pair – a risk barometer – is looking south, indicating risk aversion in the cryptocurrency market.  As many alternative cryptocurrencies are built on the ethereum blockchain, the ETH/BTC pair serves as a good indicator of risk sentiment – that is, rising ETH/BTC means risk-on and falling ETH/BTC means risk-off.  A risk-on period is characterized by an increased demand for perceived high-risk cryptocurrencies and BTC tends to depreciate against ETH in such a market. Conversely, during risk aversion, money is rotated out of altcoins and into BTC, leading to a drop in the ETH/BTC exchange rate.  So, a bearish technical setup on ETH/BTC could be considered an advance indicator of impending risk aversion and an increased flow of money from altcoins to BTC.  BTC/USD hourly chart  BTC is currently close to the lower edge of the sideways channel (now at $6,360). A drop below that level would open the doors to the 21-month EMA of $6,120.  If the bulls can pull it off, though, a move above the upper edge of $6,480 could allow a rally to last week's high of $6,810.  ETH/BTC daily chart  As can be seen, the ETH/BTC pair fell below 0.031994 BTC (Sept. 25 low) on Oct. 11, adding credence to rising wedge breakdown witnessed on Sept. 25.  The pair has repeatedly failed to get back above the former support-turned-resistance of 0.031994 BTC in the last 10 days, bolstering the already bearish setup.  As a result, ETH will likely find acceptance below Oct. 18 low of 0.030924 BTC in the next day or two and slide toward the falling channel support of 0.029395 BTC.  View  The ETH/BTC pair risks falling below 0.03 BTC in the next few days, meaning risk aversion is likely to grip the altcoin markets.  The risk-off mood will likely worsen if BTC suffers a downside break of the $6,360–$6,480 range. A, range breakdown, if confirmed, could yield a sell-off to the 21-month EMA of $6,120.  The risk appetite will likely improve if BTC sees an upside break of the trading range, in which case, prices may rise toward $6,800.

42402072,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3Khk,1540290616,Gavin Wood Announces 'Impending Release' of DIY Blockchain Tool,"Another do-it-yourself build-a-blockchain tool is about to launch.  Speaking at the Web3 Summit in Berlin on Tuesday, ethereum co-founder and Parity Technologies founder Gavin Wood announced that his company's new tool, Substrate, is weeks from release. As the technical underpinning for his interoperability protocol Polkadot, Substrate provides a generalized platform for blockchain development.  According to Wood, who spoke to CoinDesk before the announcement, Substrate will help Polkadot reach its ""main bet"" – as a simple mechanism to allow people to build and launch their own blockchains.  He told CoinDesk:  ""If everyone can build and deploy their own chain, then suddenly Polkadot becomes a much more interesting prospect.""  Describing Substrate in more detail, Wood said that it provides an entirely general purpose platform for blockchain development.  ""Substrate is much more general than ethereum,"" Wood said, adding: ""We really wanted to make something pure and general.""  Earlier this month, the Parity Technologies team announced it had used the Substrate codebase to deploy ""Shasper"" – the latest iteration of ethereum's scaling roadmap, that mixes scaling solution sharding with consensus switch, proof-of-stake.  While Substrate is already actionable, Wood emphasized that work remains to be done prior to its public release, specifically as relates to developer documentation, as well as ""rounding some corners and removing any sharp edges.""  ""I'm giving it a three week countdown or something on these lines,"" Wood said.  More development  At the conference, Wood also announced that the Substrate software will be relicensed to Apache 2, a more permissive, business-friendly license than the current GPL3.  According to the Wood, the new license, ""instantly opens the door to all of the Fortune 500 to actually experiment with it.""  On top of that, Wood also presented a new Polkadot design that, in his words, allows for ""infinite scalability."" This entails a tree-type structure of Polkadot chains running on Polkadot chains, something ""cyclical and self-referential, what mathematicians call composability,"" he said.  Wood continued, ""[It's] a hierarchy of chains and the reason that it's possible is that Polkadot can host itself, and every time you go down a level you can scale up 100 times.""  Together with Polkadot – that is targeted for release in Q3 2019 – Wood said today's Substrate release paves the way for blockchain networks of all kinds to coexist.  He told CoinDesk:  ""The vision is pluralistic, multiplicative world with lots of teams doing their thing but being able to interoperate and intercommunicate in a trust-free, autonomous fashion.""  No hard forks  It could seem a bit complicated, and sure enough, much of Wood's presentation hinged on clarifying the distinction between Polkadot and Substrate.  Speaking to Substrate specifically, Wood emphasized that it was different from ethereum in its upgradeability.  Unlike on ethereum, protocol changes with Substrate do not require a system-wide upgrade, or a hard fork, to be activated.  This will likely be attractive to many since as Wood put it, hard forks can be a ""nightmare."" Because getting all the different stakeholders on board with new changes has proved difficult for many blockchain projects in the past, Wood contended that the long-term debates this arouses makes blockchains less able to keep up with technological developments.  ""Substrate-based chains can upgrade themselves, and this ability to change is useful for fixing hiccups along the way,"" he told CoinDesk.  This works through token holders casting votes on code changes, Wood said. And in this way, Substrate and Polkadot make power structures within networks clear and transparent – distinct from the informal governance that is the basis of most cryptocurrencies today, he argued.  Wood concluded:  ""Having undefined governance doesn't bestow power onto everyone, all it does is make obscure and opaque who are the real decision makers.""

Announced today, Stern has been named the first-ever chief operating officer at blockchain software startup Bloq. Stern worked for 17 years at Fidelity, most recently as a senior vice president and the managing director of the blockchain incubator at Fidelity Labs.  Stern is leaving the financial services giant just as it launches a new digital asset trading and storage platform, Fidelity Digital Asset Services LLC, a major development in the institutionalization of cryptocurrency announced last week. But he told CoinDesk he wants to pursue bigger ambitions in blockchain.  ""I'm glad to dig deeper into the blockchain technology beyond just financial services use cases: healthcare, identity, internet of things, cross-border transactions,"" Stern said, adding:  ""It really gets to this notion of tokenization of things, that anything that can be tokenized will be, and potentially what can be decentralized will be.""  At Bloq, which provides blockchain solutions to enterprises, Stern is going to look into broad blockchain applications and delivering products to clients, he told CoinDesk.  ""My main task is to help team operationalize their client engagement and to really ensure consistent and quality delivery, provide guidance from a strategic standpoint,"" he said. ""Helping drive innovation into product development [is something] I have a lot of experience with as well.""  In a Medium post published Tuesday, Stern said he's had an eye on his new employer, founded in 2016 by developer Jeff Garzik and investor Matthew Roszak, for a while.  ""I've watched Bloq over the years from the outside – even worked together on a Fidelity project – and the vision of co-founders Jeff Garzik and Matthew Roszak resonated strongly, as did what they were building,"" Stern wrote.  Roszak said in a company press release that Stern will help Bloq take advantage of the growing convergence between the enterprise and crypto sides of the industry.  ""As the shared surface area between conventional enterprises and the world of cryptocurrency expands, there is absolutely no better partner than Hadley for this role as we pursue continued, rapid growth in our business,"" Roszak said.

In the same thread, he made another comment around 23:00 UTC, stating: ""Wanna buy some bitcoin?"" alongside an anime image that features the bitcoin logo.  The image was originally created by the website Cryptocurrency Girls, which has turned some of the world's largest cryptocurrencies into anime characters.

The early-access version of the HTC Exodus is now available for pre-order, the company announced Tuesday, and must be purchased with cryptocurrency.  Dubbed the EXODUS 1, the device can only be bought using bitcoin or ethereum, and will start shipping by December. The company also said it is looking for developers to participate in the early-access version.  The EXODUS 1 is available to customers in the U.S., Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, the U.K. and nearly 30 other countries, according to the press release.  HTC's decentralized chief officer, Phil Chen, told CoinDesk that the company is hoping to get feedback from the blockchain community about the early-access version in order to improve upon the device.  ""The goal is to start with the blockchain community and get their assistance in making our wallet and the technology even more secure, in essence testing it out and providing feedback and suggestions [and] solutions,"" he said via email, adding:  ""Recent figures show that there are around 35 million wallets out there at the moment. The HTC EXODUS 1 is about getting the consumer used to owning their own keys and going from there to develop the EXODUS into a device that can be for the broader market.""  HTC has not yet released any information about when the device might see a wider launch to the general public.  The EXODUS 1, announced at the CoinDesk Consensus conference in May, includes ""a secure enclave"" on the device that will store a user's cryptocurrency keys and is kept protected from the Android operating system.  Further, to protect users who might lose their phone or otherwise forget their keys, HTC has built a ""Social Key Recovery"" process. Users will be able to designate a few contacts as ""trustworthy,"" and each contact will be able to download a key management app.  The user's recovery seed will then be split among these trusted contacts. If a phone is lost or stolen, or a user forgets their private key, they can use these contacts to regain access to their funds.  HTC also intends to release application program interfaces (APIs) for third-party developers, allowing them use the EXODUS 1 to protect keys and sign transactions. Also in the works are plans to push a software development kit (SDK) for its wallet for partners who will help HTC expand its blockchain ecosystem.

42402037,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3IDH,1540276226,Payments Startup Square Is Open-Sourcing Its Bitcoin Storage Solution,"Mobile payments startup Square is making its bitcoin cold storage solution open-source.  Alok Menghrajani, a security engineer for the company, announced in a blog post on Tuesday that the documentation, code and tools for the company's ""Subzero"" bitcoin cold storage solution are now publicly available on Github.  Menghrajani said Square uses Subzero to hold bitcoin assets on its users' behalf in an offline environment based on a hardware security module (HSM) – the same technology the firm has been using to store encrypted keys for its other payments services.  Menghrajani added that since the underlying HSM is programmable, Square has developed a technology that can send bitcoin from a hot wallet to the cold storage at any time. When bringing coins back to the online hot wallet, however, the program requires multi-party signatures to initiate a transaction.  Further, Menghrajani said the solution can also enforce certain preset rules, such as only sending bitcoin from the cold storage to Square-owned addresses.  ""The HSM is programmable, allowing us to support bitcoin wallets today while giving us the flexibility to implement other protocols in the future,"" he added.  Square, founded by the co-founder and CEO of Twitter Jack Dorsey, first announced the launch of a bitcoin trading service via its Cash App in November last year.  The firm further expanded the bitcoin trading function to all 50 states in the U.S. in August this year after the business unit booked small margins for the firm in the first two quarters in 2018.

42402054,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3IS2,1540267252,"Distributed Ledgers, Not Tokens, Are the True Heirs to Satoshi's Vision","Adam Krellenstein is co-founder and CTO at Symbiont.io, Inc., a FinTech company focused on coupling traditional financial markets and blockchain technology. He is also the author of some of the earliest attempts to use the bitcoin blockchain for its more experimental uses.  This exclusive opinion piece is part of CoinDesk's ""Bitcoin at 10: The Satoshi White Paper"" series.      Ten years after the anniversary of the publication of the bitcoin white paper – inarguably one of the most significant technical achievements in recent history – the community that it created, and that has rallied around its grand vision, is in a crisis.  Having worked for the past decade to produce protocols that go far beyond Satoshi's original efforts in scale and ambition, we are still struggling to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the technology and the role it should play in our society. Yes, these still include fundamental questions such as ""What is a blockchain?"" and ""What is a blockchain good for?""  We struggle to understand the relationship between bitcoin and blockchain technology, between token systems and smart contracts, and between public blockchains and permissioned ones. There is one camp that sees blockchain technology as being best suited for creating digital currencies (""tokens"") like bitcoin itself, and there is another that sees the technology as promising for creating new kinds of decentralized computer applications (""smart contracts"").  Simultaneously, another fight is going on about the value of different types of blockchain networks – specifically, whether blockchains should be ""public,"" so that anyone can join the networks, or ""permissioned,"" where the membership of the network is more or less fixed.  In fact, these two arguments are tightly linked: it turns out that token systems are more useful than smart contracts when layered on a public blockchain consensus protocol.  Tokens and more tokens  Looking back to the bitcoin white paper today, it is striking that Satoshi was exactly right about the best use for a public blockchain: a digital currency and payment system.  The white paper only talks about token systems and public blockchains, so we are left on our own to figure out how best to take his seminal invention and extend it to additional use cases. And many have tried to do just that.  For my part, I've spent a lot of time thinking about these issues, having had the rare experience of working closely with both sides of both debates. First, as one of the creators of the cryptocurrency Counterparty, and then as one of the founders of Symbiont.  Counterparty is a public blockchain smart contracts platform, albeit one focused on token issuance and trading, while Symbiont is a fintech company that develops and licenses its permissioned blockchain-based smart contracts system to improve the infrastructure of traditional financial markets.  What I noticed in my time working on Counterparty, and in watching Ethereum closely since its inception, was that even though both systems were built primarily to support powerful smart contracts applications, their primary uses have been in the creation and transfer of the simplest possible digital instruments – tokens.  With Counterparty, our vision was to create a trustless network for decentralized finance with no middlemen. We implemented smart contracts for token balances, the world's first decentralized and trustless asset exchange, a platform for prediction markets using contracts for difference, a protocol for transparent elections, and a system for provably fair gaming. And we did it all as an extension of the bitcoin blockchain itself, rather than as a separate network. Nevertheless, Counterparty's adoption was always centered around its token issuance and trading functionality, rather than on the more advanced and more exciting applications that it enabled.  Similarly, it's been three years since Ethereum launched and pretty much the only thing anyone is using it for could be easily managed by colored coins (another way of adding support for simple tokens on top of bitcoin). Ethereum has received a lot of attention and produced a lot of excitement for its theoretically limitless capabilities, but to date people are actually using it only for the simplest possible decentralized applications.  Part of the reason that Ethereum's adoption has been lackluster is that it's quite hard to build real applications safely on its smart contract language, Solidity. Still, it's surprising that the most advanced Ethereum smart contract with any adoption is a cat-themed trading card game, not dissimilar to Spells of Genesis or Rare Pepes, which were launched on Counterparty long before.  Ethereum, like Counterparty before it, has been used almost exclusively for tracking tokens despite its potential for doing much more.  Where trustlessness is needed  The reason, I think, is that a smart contract system for the general public isn't actually such a great idea.  The value in taking a given application and putting it on a blockchain platform is chiefly found in making that application more broadly accessible and trustless. This is of enormous value for a simple instrument like digital cash, which benefits directly from wider adoption and purity of form. That is, bitcoin, as a payment system and store of value without (easy) confiscation, debasement, etc., is a better currency than fiat insofar as it lacks the central points of control and interference.  But for more complicated interactions among end users, where efficiency is more important than universality, it's not too difficult or painful to rely on a ""higher authority"" to act in the role of a trusted intermediary. The interactions of individuals are not complex enough to justify being turned into decentralized computer programs, not yet.  In the realm of permissioned blockchains, on the other hand, smart contracts hold more promise. The target users aren't individuals, they are large institutions (e.g. governments and corporations). The greatest benefit of permissioned blockchains is not more inclusiveness or transparency, but rather greater consistency and correctness than existing infrastructure, which is incapable of a providing single source of truth for multiple parties in a decentralized fashion.  ""Enterprise DLT"" aims to take existing business logic managed by faxes and phones, then codify that logic as a shared computer application which automates workflows and reduces operational overhead.  Large institutions tend to engage with their peers in intricate and complex ways, and, insofar as they are large institutions, there's no natural third-party qua ""higher authority"" that they could rely on for global coordination.  Ideally, this coordination would be managed by a blockchain and smart contract acting as a shared system of record and single source of truth, without giving a single party 'superuser' access to a central, canonical repository for mission-critical market data.  What we knew all along  A blockchain is a way for multiple parties in a decentralized computer network to see a consistent view of the world, so blockchain technology can primarily be valuable either when replacing a consistent centralized system with a consistent decentralized one (the way bitcoin replaces fiat currency), or when turning an inconsistent decentralized system into a consistent decentralized system (the way a smart contract would replace fragmented financial markets infrastructure).  In the former case, the value created is in the disintermediation of a central party; in the latter, it's in the increased efficiency of a coherent, authoritative source of truth in a decentralized system.  It's fitting, then, that token systems – the simplest possible smart contracts – should be as widely accessible as possible, whereas smart contracts are most useful in permissioned settings, where they are faster, cheaper, and easier to use, and where they can solve a particular business problem in a deliberate and controlled manner.  The conclusion that I've come to is that, just as was originally envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto, the greatest use of a public blockchain is in fact as a digital currency and payment system. Generalizations of Satoshi's innovations in the time since he launched bitcoin, manifest partly in the enterprise DLT space, are not competitive with bitcoin.  Instead of replacing fiat currency with digital gold, they may be used to build new kinds of databases that can support workflows that are completely un-amenable to management within the context of a traditional client-server framework. Efforts to build complex smart contracts on public blockchain networks aren't tackling problems inherent in the design of existing decentralized systems (the way bitcoin did); but rather are striving to become more usable versions of centralized systems.  They are, of course, anything but.

42402045,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3IJB,1540256875,Police Filings Mount as Investors Demand Funds from WEX Exchange,"Users of the long-troubled cryptocurrency exchange WEX have begun filing police reports after more than three months of being unable to withdraw major cryptocurrencies or fiat, CoinDesk has learned.  A WEX trader named Ruslan, who has been encouraging other users to seek an official investigation, told CoinDesk that as many as 35 such reports have been filed thus far online through the website of the Russian Interior Ministry. Coordinating through a specially created website and a Telegram chat group, users have been sharing confirmation numbers the filing system sent them after their reports were submitted. At least seven such reports CoinDesk was able to confirm against the Interior Ministry's website.  The fact that users of a cryptocurrency exchange that has operated at the fringes of the market would seek help from the government is itself notable. WEX was built on the ashes of BTC-e, the mysterious, long-running exchange that ultimately collapsed after U.S. officials seized its domain and then slapped BTC-e and its suspected operator with a massive $110 million fine.  But this summer, the initial enthusiasm around what was effectively a rebirth of BTC-e gave way to growing complaints around withdrawals, which manifested in sky-high prices well beyond those reported on more well-known exchanges. Those issues continue to this day, with the price of USDT – a controversial stablecoin that lost its parity with the U.S. dollar last week – trading for a whopping $6.99 on WEX.  As such, WEX traders – after months of demanding answers (WEX's last public message on Twitter was posted in late August) – are taking matters into their own hands, seeking an investigation in an effort to get their money back. What's more, recent developments continue to further stoke questions over who is actually running WEX and, by association, who is safeguarding user funds.  Ruslan told CoinDesk that he hoped to make law enforcement take measures against WEX's CEO Dmitri Vasiliev and ""his conspirators"" to prevent them from initiating any new projects in crypto.  ""The main idea has been to show other users that they are not alone, that we can act together and fight for our rights by legal means,"" he said.  Neither WEX's CEO Dmitrii Vasilev nor WEX's official Twitter account responded to CoinDesk's requests for comment for this story.  Questions amid eye-watering prices  To be sure, users say they've been able to withdraw certain coins from WEX since the troubles began – but at a very steep cost.  Specifically, tether (USDT), zcash, namecoin and peercoin have been available for withdrawal. But their prices on WEX are extremely high compared to the rest of the market, so buying them just to get money off the platform is an expensive proposition.  Other cryptos also maintain extraordinarily high price tags on WEX, with bitcoin trading at $8,602 (compared to about $6,450) and ether at $319 (versus roughly $204).  At some point, around late July, fiat withdrawals were opened but with commissions ranging as high as 45 percent. Even at that price, some users in WEX online chats said they were considering taking their money out, since the longer they waited, the less they trusted the exchange's management. But now, even this option is no longer available, users have told CoinDesk.  It was around that time that it became public that the owner and CEO, Dmitrii Vasilev, was going to sell the exchange to Dmitry Khavchenko, a militia fighter in Eastern Ukraine, according to a report by Russian media service RBC. Withdrawals were frozen in the wake of that report, and Vasilev later told CoinDesk he hadn't been in control of the exchange and that the administrators weren't communicating with him. The identities of the exchange's administrators, as well as those who actually custody user funds, has never been openly disclosed.  Khavchenko told CoinDesk last week that the deal was signed and the money passed to the seller. Yet according to the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority of Singapore, where WEX is registered, as of Monday, Vasilev was still listed as the owner.  With traders devastated by the situation, trading volume on WEX, once in the tens of millions, has plunged to less than $1 million daily.
