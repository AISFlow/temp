Crypto Investors Like the Latest CPI Report and Send BTC Higher  By James Rubin  The July Consumer Price Index (CPI) report in the U.S. was sweet music for crypto investors.  They sent the price of bitcoin higher minutes after the U.S. Commerce Department published the July inflation reading, which showed prices declining at a slightly lower rate than most analysts expected.  Bitcoin was recently trading at roughly $23,850, up nearly 3% over the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had breezed past the $24,000 threshold earlier in the day and remained in the upper end of the range it has occupied for the better part of two weeks. Markets were feeling more hopeful the U.S. Federal Reserve was succeeding in its attempt to tame inflation without casting the economy into recession, and could boost interest rates at a more moderate rate at its next meeting in September.  Ether cracked the $1,800 mark for the second time in three days, increasing more than 8% over the previous day. The second-largest crypto by market cap has been gaining momentum even without the CPI news. The Ethereum blockchain is nearing the eagerly expected Merge, which will shift the protocol from proof-of-work to a less energy-sapping proof-of-stake model. Most other major cryptos also were basking in sunshine, with AAVE rising almost 14% and FTM and STORJ up more than 12% at one point.  “Crypto has not sat idly by and has pushed higher on the news, albeit not to radically higher levels than in past days,"" Simon Peters, crypto market analyst at social investing network eToro, wrote in an email. ""Given crypto asset markets’ recent tight correlation with U.S. equities, this should come as no surprise. At the bottom of this is a change in the makeup of the market.  The CPI dip resulted largely from improvements in long-beleaguered supply chains and declining fuel prices. U.S. gas prices have dropped under $4 per gallon, about a dollar under where they stood in early June. A barrel of Brent crude oil, a widely watched measure of energy markets, has spent much of the month hovering in the mid $90 range, down from a high over $120 in late spring.  Stocks climb  Major equity indexes, which cryptos have largely tracked throughout the year, savored the CPI news with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 climbing nearly 3% and 2.1%, respectively. Investors are now encouraged that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates 50 basis points instead of a more aggressive 75 points that seemed the likelier option only a few days ago. Target rate probabilities even prior to the CPI had shifted 68% chance of a 75 basis point increase to 38%, as CoinDesk's Glenn Williams Jr. reported.  Meanwhile, the crypto industry slogged through a mix of good and bad news with Coinbase (COIN) part of both. Late Tuesday, following the crypto exchange giant's release of disappointing second-quarter results, Bank of America (BAC) maintained its buy recommendation, saying Coinbase was well positioned to successfully navigate the crypto winter and take market share.  JPMorgan Chase also noted some positive signs for the company even during a challenging quarter. But in its quarterly report, Coinbase disclosed that it is under investigation by U.S. securities regulators over its token listing processes as well as its staking programs and yield-generating products.  In comments to CoinDesk, Howard Greenberg, cryptocurrency educator at Prosper Trading Academy, was optimistic about future price increases. “I think the market will continue to find confidence in the Fed staying on track with its proposed increases to the interest rates at the September meeting and we will continue to see our relief rally pick up steam in the crypto market,” Howard Greenberg, cryptocurrency educator at Prosper Trading Academy, told CoinDesk.

Insights  Governments Focus on Crypto Is Too Narrow  By Shaurya Malwa  Business and computer science professors from The University of Sydney, one of Australia’s leading academic institutions, say governments are taking a one-sided approach in regulating cryptocurrencies, failing to capture its nuances beyond digital payments.  On Tuesday, the country’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), announced that it would develop a “limited scale” pilot to explore use cases and potential economic benefits of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The project will take about a year to complete. Meanwhile, over the past 24 hours, Australia crypto exchanges generated just over $14 million in trading volume.  Academics, however, say well-intentioned government projects miss a key part of the ethos of cryptocurrencies.  “There is an isolated focus on crypto’s financial and economic aspects, while the cultural, social and political ramifications are ignored,” says Daniel Schlagwein, associate professor at The University of Sydney Business School. “There is still a fundamental misunderstanding or at least a rigid, one-sided view on cryptocurrencies – their nature is not fully understood. Old and outdated theories are used on a new phenomenon.”  “For example, I would like the government to specify how citizens of Australia retain their current option to pay anonymously via cash,” Schlagwein told CoinDesk. “Once cash is de facto or de jure faded out, are all our payments then digitally traced and trackable? This would be horrific from a surveillance perspective.”  Unintended consequences  Schlagwein added that while traceability of all movements and payments of Australian citizens is desirable from an anti-money laundering and law enforcement perspective, it would be “easy to go wrong once such systems are in place.”  “There may be unintended, long-term consequences of designing our societal systems in a one-sided manner and short-term orientation,” he argued.  Other professors say small-scale trials in a real-world setting are necessary before such a system becomes operational.  “The government could also look to encourage small-scale application trials to see whether a new ecosystem can be stimulated and assess its feasibility, said Qiang Tang, a cryptocurrency and blockchain expert at the University of Sydney’s School of Computer Science.  Tang told CoinDesk that CBDCs could have multiple benefits, such as creating a more efficient monetary and payment system and enabling more fin-tech innovations that “play a fundamental role in Australia’s national digital economy strategy.”  The RBA announced its intention to study a potential CBDC with the development of a proof-of-concept (PoC) in early 2020 for the issuance of a tokenized digital dollar for the wholesale market.  The bank considers Australia to have relatively modern and well-functioning payment and settlement systems, and a CBDC is the natural step forward for the evolution of money in the country.

They watched cash flow plummet on their machines, forcing them to look to other ways to finance their operations. The natural response to this was for public miners to dip into their bitcoin reserves and begin selling off BTC to keep their operations going. For a time, it seemed miners would stop selling due to the recovery in price, but this is proving not to be the case. Miners Offload More BTC Bitcoin miners had sold off more bitcoin than they had mined for the first time in May. The same trend then continued into June, when miners had sold thousands of BTC to cover operational and other costs. It seems this trend did not end in the month of June either, as the miners continued to sell off coins.

42421133,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZUez,1660168372,"After Brutal Q2, Coinbase Needs to ‘Get Smart’ About Revenue Streams: Analyst Says","Coinbase Global (COIN) will need to reevaluate its approach when it comes to earning revenue, said Michael Safai, a managing partner at trading firm Dexterity Capital.  Safai told CoinDesk TV on Wednesday the U.S. crypto exchange’s lower-than-expected earnings report does not come as a surprise, but does highlight how the exchange’s business model and overall management style might be falling out of time.  “Coinbase is going to have to get smart about how they are going to make revenue numbers in the future,” Safai said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” show.  On Tuesday, the largest publicly traded crypto company in the U.S. posted a net loss of more than $1 billion for the second quarter amid declining trading volumes and a so-called crypto winter. The exchange missed analysts’ revenue expectations by more than 30%, falling to $803 million.  Safai said Coinbase’s overall strategy in the near term needs to be “survive, be smart about spending” and “find new ways to generate revenue.”  That could mean its existing business model needs a facelift. Safai suggested the exchange could start charging fees for market data and colocation. Rival exchanges Binance and FTX also support thriving options markets, for instance.  Historically, the centralized exchange has derived almost all of its profit from transaction fees and may have inadvertently neglected other sources of revenue, Safai said. That’s not for a lack of trying.  Earlier this year, the exchange launched a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace in a bid to capture part of that growing market. But its effort was unpopular since launch, and, according to its earnings report, user growth fell from 9.2 million monthly active users to just 9 million this quarter.  As part of a wider effort to trim its budget, the exchange said it would be cutting back on its marketing spending. In June of this year, Coinbase laid off about 18% of its staff – about 1,100 employees.  “It’s still early days, and they need to spend a lot of money getting new users. Cutting your marketing budget, that’s going to make that hard,” Safai said.  Other headwinds include a marketwide trend to drop trading fees to zero, lack of interest among retail investors and regulatory uncertainty. Last month the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said nine tokens listed to trade on Coinbase were unregistered securities, as part of an investigation into insider trading allegations by a former employee at the firm.  Moreover, even though Coinbase appeared to be unaffected by the crypto contagion that spread from Voyager Digital, Three Arrows Capital and Celsius Network, those failures still “sucked a lot of leverage and assets out of the ecosystem.”  “Retail users, they're spooked by the failures, but they're also kind of seeing less to do [in crypto],” Safai said. “And so this is generally bad news.”  Moving forward, Safai said retail investors could become more comfortable as crypto moves toward regulation. He adds that Coinbase acquiring FairX is a smart move.  “By acquiring FairX, Coinbase now has a legit properly licensed futures platform,” he said. “But to do that, you have to invest a lot and they’re doing that, to say the least.”  Read more: SEC Probing Coinbase for Allegedly Listing Securities: Report",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/10/after-brutal-q2-coinbase-needs-to-get-smart-about-revenue-streams-analyst-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c9a8739328ed78c4af9d7417b3704068c29e52f8-6294x4721.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412232,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl3P3w,1660167252,Corn Farmers Hedge Their Crops With Futures. This Solana DEX Wants Vaildators to Follow Suit,"SALT LAKE CITY –– It’s second nature for corn farmers to hedge their crop yield with futures contracts. A decentralized finance (DeFi) trading protocol wants crypto validators on the Solana blockchain to follow that risk-averse playbook for their token rewards.  Decentralized finance derivatives trading app Cypher is preparing to offer a specialty hedging service to Solana’s validators, the server-runners who lend their compute power to keep the network chugging. In exchange for that work they get SOL tokens – a yield whose market is a whole lot more volatile than corn.  Hedging against token volatility is nothing new to crypto’s compute class. Big bitcoin miners keep their cash flow predictable using derivatives that shield them from the changing price of BTC. Even so, the practice hasn’t yet caught on in Solanaland, two industry participants told CoinDesk.  Cypher seeks to change that with a new futures product planned for later this quarter. Called a “validator vault,” it will help validators lock in the price of SOL they expect to receive at the end of every Solana “epoch,” about two days. Core contributors Barrett and Alex discussed the plans with CoinDesk at the mtnDAO hacker house here, which Cypher is hosting.  “We want to offer validators the same hedging opportunities” corn farmers use in the traditional commodities market, said Alex, who hails from corn country, USA. “We have identified that there are a lot of crypto specific commodities – such as validator rewards” that Cypher thinks is ripe for the picking.  Read more: Cypher Raises $2.1M for Traditional Futures Market on Solana  Whether validators will jump at the opportunity is not yet clear. Two prominent Solana validators told CoinDesk that they could simply buy put options to hedge against their volatile token rewards – even so, neither have.  “I don't see a need to hedge token rewards for my validator,” Brian Long, a Solana validator and co-founder of crypto infrastructure company Triton One, said. He pointed out that the fees associated with hedging could eat away at cash flow.  Still, Barrett, the Cypher contributor, told CoinDesk that Cypher’s monthly expiration markets could have more appeal versus other on-chain options, which he said have shorter time frames. He also said that the futures route is more streamlined and therefore more liquid than options markets.  The pseudonymous Laine_sa, a vocal Solana validator, said one pain point for validators gaming out future SOL rewards is the changing size of their stake. Token holders can “stake” their assets with larger operators to earn rewards – but they can also de-stake and reduce the pool from which their chosen validator can earn tokens.  “We get payouts every three days, and who knows how much stake you'll have a month from now,” Laine_sa said in a Discord message.  The planned product comes as Cypher beefs up its existing derivatives decentralized exchange with a streamlined trading backend and new tools for pro traders.",NEUTRAL,BTC | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/10/corn-farmers-hedge-their-crops-with-futures-this-solana-dex-wants-vaildators-to-follow-suit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/821516925059437a8bed0f067aa9bf28473eea8c-4447x3335.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394949,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWeRO,1660165881,"Aggressive Rate Hikes Still Necessary, Say Fed’s Evans and Kashkari","The Federal Reserve will likely continue to raise interest rates aggressively, even though Wednesday’s inflation data was a positive step, said Chicago Fed President Charles Evans. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari agreed, saying it was unrealistic to expect easing anytime soon.  Bitcoin (BTC) jumped 2% following news that the inflation rate slowed to 8.5% in July from 9.1% one month earlier. Ether (ETH) surged 7%, as investors placed bets the Fed might ease off its pace of 75-basis-point rate hikes.  Indeed, traders now see a 65% chance of a 50-basis-point rate hike in September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, rather than another 75-basis-point increase, which was the likelier scenario just a day ago.  “I expect that we will be increasing rates the rest of this year and into next year to make sure inflation gets back to our 2% objective,” Evans said during an event hosted by Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, on Wednesday. While inflation did slow a bit, the pace remains at an “unacceptable high,” he added.  Charles Evans said he expects the target range for the fed funds rate – currently at 2.25% to 2.5% – to rise to 3.25% to 3.5% by the end of the year, and 3.75% to 4% by the end of 2023.  Colleague Kashkari is more hawkish, expecting the Fed funds rate to rise to nearly 4% by the end of this year and almost 4.5% by the close of 2023. Today’s data and the strong jobs report from last week didn’t change his anticipated rate-hike path, he said at the Aspen Ideas Conference on Wednesday.  As for the U.S. central bank trimming rates in early 2023, Kashkari called that idea “unrealistic” until the Fed is convinced inflation is “well on its way” back down to the 2% target.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/10/aggressive-rate-hikes-still-necessary-say-feds-evans-and-kashkari,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5922004380acdc23008513da3beb7fab028e2fff-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411111,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giC9GX,1660165847,"Bye-bye Brokers: EU Tries Stock Trading, the Web3 Way","The European Union (EU) has had a busy few months defining crypto regulations, with its flagship licensing regime, the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation and controversial money-laundering controls both securing political deals meaning they’ll soon become law.  Alongside those, sits a lower-profile, temporary law that seeks to apply the innovations of distributed ledger technology (DLT) to financial market activities that mimic stock and bond trading, offering a more efficient way for the ordinary retail trader to get access to financial markets that are often closely guarded by incumbent players.  Under the law, financial-trading companies can pilot DLT tools to directly settle some trades without having to use an intermediary, saving time and money, potentially meaning retail investors in traditional markets get access that is cheaper, more direct and more efficient.  In practice it might just be financial-market incumbent behemoths able to take advantage, but Web 3 fans should still be cheering about the possibility of cutting out the middleman, CoinDesk has been told. No more dealing via brokers or other financiers – you might soon be able to get hands-on access.  “It’s not a revolution, but it's seeing that politicians in Europe and authorities in Europe are aware of their needs and are trying to do something about it,” João Vieira dos Santos, a law professor at the Universidade Lusófona in Lisbon, said. “It’s a very good thing for the European market.”  The EU agreed to this new pilot regime temporarily allowing DLT-based stock and bond trading earlier this year, and it takes effect in March 2023. Compared with MiCA – which introduces greater control over previously unregulated assets like stablecoins – the pilot seeks the exact opposite: streamlining the rules that apply to crypto tokens that resemble stocks or bonds, and so already fall under financial market law.  In the EU, just as elsewhere, financial trading is an alphabet soup of entities and regulations in which brokers, clearinghouses and trading venues of multiple kinds all play a part. Laws such as the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) and Central Securities Depository Regulation (CSDR) are designed to safeguard stability and prevent clients getting scammed.  Both crypto fans and conventional financiers wonder whether DLT could step in to simplify how stock trades get processed and registered, cutting out some of the intermediaries without compromising on safety. After all, blockchain is all about getting rid of centralized gatekeepers and giving people better, more direct access to finance.  Read more: FTX’s Bankman-Fried Pitches CFTC on Directly Clearing Customers’ Crypto Swaps  Across the pond, FTX.US’s Sam-Bankman Fried is seeking permission to be able to clear derivative contracts directly, rather than referring them to separate clearinghouses. His pitch to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission to be allowed to short-circuit financial market rules in the name of efficiency is, perhaps predictably, being fiercely resisted by market incumbents like Chicago’s CME Group.  But in the EU, so far, attempts to get this off the ground have largely failed. The Luxembourg Stock Exchange allows security tokens – crypto versions of financial instruments such as bonds – to be included on its official list. But innovative assets can’t be admitted for trading on the exchange itself due to EU law.  In 2018, France’s ID2S sought to use DLT to disrupt the relatively staid market of securities depositories, the financial infrastructure that records when securities change hands. But by March of this year, the company had given up and asked regulators to withdraw its authorization.  “Though the financial sector got interested early on in this distributed ledger technology via experiments, those embarking on the industrial phase are a rarity,” said a 2021 report by the French central bank.  Read more: EU Set to Experiment With Blockchain-Based Stock, Bond and Fund Trading  The new pilot regime streamlines existing arrangements in two ways. It allows securities traders, including regular retail investors, to interact directly with the market – as, under current laws intended to halt mis-selling and malpractice, they have to do so via regulated intermediaries such as brokers.  It also allows exchanges to register the tokens themselves, rather than storing them in a separately regulated securities depository, something that helps realize Web3 ambitions, CoinDesk was told.  “Only one entity being responsible for all the market: This could be one step in the direction of the DeFi [Decentralized Finance] objectives,” said Vieira dos Santos, who serves as an adviser to the Portuguese Securities Market Commission and has written extensively about the plans.  Caution  Despite the good intentions of cutting red tape, in some areas the rules may achieve the opposite, Vieira dos Santos worries.  Retail investors trying to use the pilot without a broker will be subjected to a test set by the regulator to ensure they are knowledgeable about the products they buy. In practice, that could prove even more burdensome than existing procedures, which the slicker financial-trading apps like Robinhood can carry out swiftly and automatically.  Read more: Here's What Still Needs to Happen Before the EU's MiCA Bill Becomes Law  “Each national authority will assess in their own way,” Vieira dos Santos said. “It’s maybe too careful a step.”  Lawmakers’ caution might also mean that they miss out on another regulatory goal – allowing innovative DLT-based new entrants into the market. Innovative newcomers are given some legal shortcuts to help them get set up – but not many, and hefty capital requirements could prove too costly for smaller companies, he said. That could mean only established players like Nasdaq and Euronext can benefit, and only in larger EU jurisdictions such as France and Germany.  “There are a lot of blockchain companies that are interested … but it's going to be very difficult for them,” he said. “Maybe the only big entities will enter.”  Read more: U.K. Aims to Become Global Crypto Hub, Exchequer Says  Rigid  Those problems may be compounded by the rigidity of the law. The experiment is limited to particular technologies, and to crypto versions of conventional financial instruments like securities and derivatives. That means it can’t adapt to new ideas like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Ian Gauci, managing partner at law firm GTG Advocates and member of the Maltese Blockchain Task Force, told CoinDesk.  In “the normal exchange … that settles only securities, there is no space for other tokenized assets that do not conform to the existing financial services,” Gauci said. “NFTs would become captured only here if they are financial instruments.”  “What if, during this six year timeframe … even the concept of DLT… changes?” he said, adding that markets may in the future decide the Next Big Thing isn’t Web3, but instead some other innovation. “I’ve seen the hype … today it’s DLT, tomorrow it might be AI [Artificial Intelligence].”  Worse still, because it’s just a pilot – lasting for three years with an option to extend by another three – it could throttle the business case. Trading venues may not see returns repaid over that period, especially as they might have to keep their conventional system running in parallel.  “If you’re going to settle securities … using a particular DLT platform, would you invest in something like that for a mere three to six years?” Gauci said. “From the investment point of view, it leaves a lot of questions.”  For the time being, we still don’t know the exact details of the EU’s legal regime. The European Securities and Markets Authority is still consulting on its finer points, like how to apply for permission to run a pilot. (Guidance setting out exactly how carve-outs from current laws will work won’t be out until 2025.)  Competition  In the meantime, observers are looking at how the EU compares to the global competition. A June bill proposed by U.S. Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) included some text in this area, but it’s “not so organized and so comprehensible as the European proposals,” Vieira dos Santos said.  Gauci, meanwhile, is watching the U.K. – which has a new regulatory freedom post-Brexit and is committed to becoming a crypto hub.  The U.K. “has already issued an intention to issue a sandbox as well within this sector,” Gauci said. “It's already moving away from the EU regarding AI regulation … they can do it because they're out of the EU.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/10/bye-bye-brokers-eu-tries-stock-trading-the-web3-way,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/02f101331922c3005f60977c5406351b00f1433b-6720x4480.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The CPI is a measure of inflation in the U.S. that accounts for the price of a weighted average market basket of goods and services purchased by households. Changes in the CPI track changes in prices over time. In July the CPI increased 8.5%, still high but lower than the 8.7% rate that most analysts had predicted and an improvement on June’s 9.1% inflation rate. The June reading represented a four-decade high.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  BTC’s increase more than reversed its 3% decline from the previous day. Altcoins also rose. Ether (ETH), the second-largest crypto by market cap behind bitcoin, recently rose more than 8%. AVAX increased 5%. MATIC and LINK rose 3% and 5%, respectively.  Traditional markets jumped on the CPI news, with the Dow Jones Industrial average (DJIA), S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 increasing 1.6%, 2.1% and 2.9%, respectively.  In energy markets, the price of crude oil increased 1.2%, while that of natural gas rose 5.4%. Gold, which is often viewed as a hedge against inflation, declined 0.36%.  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $23,668 +2.5%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,824 +7.8%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 4,210.24 +2.1%      ●Gold: $1,806 per troy ounce +0.7%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.79% −0.01       Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  US Inflation Slows, Markets Respond With Higher Prices  Slowing U.S. inflation was the news of the day for crypto markets.  BTC’s hourly chart showed an immediate reaction to the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI), soaring past $24,000, the upper part of a range that it has occupied for much of the past two weeks as investors savored some rare favorable news about inflation.  The CPI rose 8.5% in July, lower than most analysts’ 8.7% forecast and an improvement on June’s disappointing 9.1% reading.  Subsequent BTC candles showed a narrowing of BTC’s trading range in the hours following the release. Intraday traders appear to have reacted to the Relative Strength Index (RSI) breaching 70 into what is traditionally labeled “overbought” territory. Overbought implies that the magnitude of change in an asset has taken it past its fair market value, making it a candidate to be sold.  Intraday traders of an asset generally hold assets for less than 24 hours. An overbought reading on an hourly chart would signal an intraday trader to exit a position, despite the RSI not indicating the same.  The CPI will strongly affect decisions by the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets monetary policy and will next meet in September.  The unexpectedly favorable CPI, which suggests inflation could be waning, may increase the likelihood the FOMC increases interest rates by 50 basis points instead of by a more aggressive 75 basis points.  Tuesday’s Market Wrap showed target rate probabilities prior to the CPI shifting from that day’s 68% chance of a 75 basis point increase to 38%.  BTC’s spot price is approaching an area of high options activity  BTC options activity is showing signs of bullish sentiment. Call open interest exceeds put open interest, resulting in a call/put ratio of 1.85.  A call represents the right but not the obligation to purchase an asset at a specific price, while a put option represents the right but not the obligation to sell an asset at a specified price.  The open interest represents the number of options contracts currently active. When call open interest exceeds put open interest, it implies that more traders are buying calls than puts and thus reflects bullish sentiment.  Currently there are spikes in call open interest at both the $24,000 and $25,000 price levels (with price level often being called the “strike” price). As BTC prices move past $24,000, BTC will likely see increased buying pressure, which could push prices higher. The same holds true for the $25,000 strike price.

Norton said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” show on Tuesday that Ethereum’s ability to sustain its growth with the PoW consensus mechanism is “not going to be tenable” and said the method isn’t energy efficient.  “In order for Ethereum to move with the ecosystem and continue to be the leader and remain true to its principles of being open and permissionless, a transition out of proof-of-work is absolutely going to be essential,” Norton said.  Norton’s comments come as Ethereum prepares to switch to a proof-of-stake (PoS) method of maintaining its network and validating transactions with a software update known as the Merge.  According to developers, the proof-of-stake mechanism is more efficient and cheaper than proof-of-work.  Norton says the update may be pushed “further down the road,” perhaps until next year if the Merge doesn’t go as planned. It is supposed to go live next month.  As the Merge approaches, Norton said institutional adoption will likely increase, especially if users begin to better understand what the change will mean for the blockchain.  Institutional investors now appear to be bullish about the Merge, piling into ETH-based funds, Norton said, but if the Merge takes longer than expected, users and investors could grow “restless” and pull out.  Norton said the Merge will “provide users a sharp contrast” between PoW and PoS, and could even affect bitcoin (BTC).  “Now you have another potentially deflationary asset in the crypto space that is more energy efficient and has more use cases,” Norton said of ether.  The Bitcoin network, on the other hand, has been designed for the exchange of its native token, which could resonate more with users who view the token as a store of value.  Norton said that “most users are not going to see a thing” following the Merge but that the price of ether will likely surge as it has done this summer.

World Table Tennis (WTT), the events arm of the sport's governing body, said Wednesday it is pursuing Web3 initiatives in partnership with non-fungible token startup NFT Tech – in an effort to expand the game.  The multiyear tie-up will see WTT issue “digital collectibles, metaverse experiences, play-to-earn and move-to-earn gaming,” according to a release shared with CoinDesk. WTT told CoinDesk it runs more than 50 events a year.  Table tennis is hardly alone in the metaverse sports movement: All four major sports leagues in the U.S. are experimenting with the tech as a way to engage new audiences.  While it’s uncertain exactly what role crypto will have in the future of these sports, it’s becoming clear that most sporting organizations are keeping a close eye on Web3 as a growth and marketing tool, especially for its younger, tech-savvy demographics.  “In many cases, we will be appealing to first-time wallet holders,” NFT Tech CEO Adam De Cata said in an email. “Using NFT technology, we will actively explore the 'IRL' utility and access possibilities such as tickets to tournaments, training facilities and online broadcasts to VIP events.”  De Cata is no stranger to tennis-themed NFT crossovers.

42411416,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNeAy,1660160919,What Happens When You Try to Sanction a Protocol Like Tornado Cash,"The U.S. government's unprecedented move to sanction a smart contract on Ethereum continues to produce perverse consequences.  On Monday, the U.S. Treasury Department issued a blanket ban on crypto mixing service Tornado Cash. All American “persons” are barred from interacting with the open-source protocol, in a move that is likely to have widespread implications for the world of crypto.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Circle, one of the issuing entities behind the USDC stablecoin, immediately banned 38 addresses that had connections to Tornado in their transaction history following the sanction. Anecdotal reports suggest other platforms and companies are also enforcing bans.  Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control has put a massive hole in the center of the crypto economy by making it a felony to interact with Tornado Cash. Not only has it become harder to achieve transactional secrecy on the most-used blockchain, Ethereum, but platforms and people now need to determine their exposure and take steps to mitigate potential regulatory action.  “It’s a bit early to speculate here. This is new territory. We are still seeing what is even possible,” Coin Center Director of Communications Neeraj Agrawal , said via email. The second-order effects of the ban are still playing out, and it remains to be seen whether regulators can enforce such a wide ban or if crypto is capable of complying.  Tornado Cash is an open-source project that enables people to shield their transaction histories from public view. The U.S. government alleges it is also a service that was used to launder more than $7 billion worth of ill-gotten gains since 2019, including by North Korean hackers.  See also: What the Tornado Cash Sanction Means for Privacy Coins  Instead of targeting said hackers or going after identifiable bad actors, the government has imposed a sweeping ban on the protocol. Elliptic, an analytics company, said it has identified some $1.5 billion in illicit funds earned through ransomware, fraud or hacks.  Meanwhile, data firm Chainalysis released a report claiming that use of crypto mixers hit an all-time monthly high in April this year – after $51.8 million was laundered through various platforms.  ""It is not any specific bad actor who is being sanctioned, but instead it is all Americans who may wish to use this automated tool in order to protect their own privacy while transacting online who are having their liberty curtailed without the benefit of any due process,” Coin Center Executive Director Jerry Brito and Research Director Peter Van Valkenburgh wrote earlier this week.  Tornado is also a key component of the Ethereum “money stack.” It’s not the only way to anonymize transactions on the blockchain, but it was perhaps the most used. It’s likely the vast majority of applications that support ETH have some exposure to the mixing service. (Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin disclosed he used the platform ahead of donating funds to Ukraine this year.)  Moreover, although Tornado now has a criminal designation, the government cannot actually shut the application down. Nor can it stop people from interacting with the code or redeploying it to a new, non-sanctioned address.  Tuesday, a prankster made light of the situation, showing the difficulty the government will have in enforcing its sanction by sending small amounts of ETH from a Tornado wallet to high-profile crypto holders, including Jimmy Fallon and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. Crypto transactions cannot be refused – and those on the receiving end may now be deemed liable for interacting with a sanctioned address.  ""Protocols strictly solving for transactional privacy face a challenging path forward, as their narrow focus makes them a target for regulators that primarily seek to curb illicit financial activity,"" Tor Bair, founder of the privacy-focused Secret Network, told CoinDesk.  ""Protocols that haven't been actively thinking about these possibilities from Day 1 are in for a nasty surprise. You cannot build any kind of reliable or sustainable privacy solution without considering every threat and tradeoff,"" he added.  In a telling sign of how the Tornado ban may shake out across the industry, community members of MakerDAO are working on a contingency plan in case it gets “nuked” by regulators due to its exposure to Tornado. Maker is the algorithmic issuer of the DAI stablecoin, a platform that allows people to mint U.S. dollar proxies by depositing crypto.  Maker founder Rune Christensen began detailing an emergency plan to shut down “core” contracts that underpin the stablecoin, which appears to be garnering majority support. Of particular concern is DAI’s exposure to the USDC stablecoin, which currently accounts for more than a third of its collateralized deposits. Some $3.56 billion USDC is currently held by Maker.  Maker is currently the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol by value, and so its moves here are significant. It’s likely DeFi platforms across the board are working to reduce their exposure to USDC and other offending assets, which sit on their balance sheets like ticking timebombs. Unraveling this could be costly and time consuming, but it’s necessary.  See also: Cloning Tornado Cash Would Be Easy, But Risky  Circle bills its U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin as the most compliant and trusted on the market, and even before the Tornado sanction Circle had blacklisted nearly 50 addresses to comply with law enforcement demands. USDC has therefore been integrated widely through the DeFi sector.  Directing ire at Circle for following the rules – even if the rules are overbroad and misunderstand how crypto works – is not the solution. But protocols should consider following OG Erik Voorhees' demand and wean themselves off of USDC in favor of more censorship-resistant alternatives.  Although it’s unknown how things will play out over the next days, weeks and months, it is becoming clear that the desires of crypto and the demands of the 21st century modern governments are not compatible.

42394972,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWeh8,1660158727,What’s at Stake: Will the Merge Turn Ether Into a Security?,"Ethereum’s upcoming Merge could make the second-largest blockchain greener, faster and cheaper. But a law professor says it could also create regulatory headaches by transforming ether (ETH), the network’s native asset, into a security under U.S. law.  “After the Merge, there will be a strong case that ether will be a security. The token in any proof-of-stake system is likely to be a security,” tweeted Georgetown Law professor Adam Levitin on July 23.  If Levitin is right, and, more importantly, if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shares his view, exchanges that list ether (and that would be nearly all of them) would be subject to more onerous regulatory requirements. Like the bitcoin (BTC) cryptocurrency, ether has until now been treated as a commodity, outside the SEC’s jurisdiction.  Most chatter in the Ethereum ecosystem has concerned technical aspects of a post-Merge proof-of-stake network rather than such legal questions. Goerli, a software update expected to take place Wednesday, is the final test before the second-largest blockchain fully transitions from the more energy-intensive proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. The switch is expected to be complete by October.  Read more: Goerli Is Coming: Ethereum’s Last Rehearsal Before the Merge  Levitin’s argument is anchored in the Howey Test – detailed in a 1946 U.S. Supreme Court ruling often used to determine whether an asset is a security. To fully appreciate Levitin’s perspective, it’s important to understand Howey and the concept of staking in a proof-of-stake system.  Staking  Proof-of-stake is a consensus mechanism that allows all nodes on a blockchain to agree on the state of a network. It requires nodes called validators to propose and validate new blocks. Validators must pony up capital for a chance to participate in this process (whereas proof-of-work, the mechanism Ethereum is replacing, requires mining nodes to expend energy as they compete to find or “mine” the next block). This investment of capital is called staking.  Read more: What Is Staking?  The minimum staking requirement for Ethereum validators is 32 ETH, which is equivalent to roughly $53,000 as of this writing. The incentive for staking and investing hardware and software resources into a network is to earn rewards. According to the Ethereum Foundation, the nonprofit that guides software development for the network, validators can currently earn about 4.2% annually. For perspective, that’s nearly double what a one-year certificate of deposit (CD) from a typical U.S. bank would pay.  Validators are randomly chosen to propose and validate blocks. The higher the amount of staked ETH, the higher the probability of being chosen and rewarded (Ethereum has over 400,000 validators on its fledgling Beacon Chain). In other words, the more you stake, the more you make.  Read more: Proof-of-Work vs. Proof-of-Stake: What Is the Difference?  William John Howey  Let’s review the history and mechanics of Howey to understand Levitin’s argument.  William John Howey was born in southern Illinois in 1876. He eventually moved to Lake County, Florida, where he became a successful real estate developer and politician. He specialized in growing and selling citrus fruits. Howey also sold land sales contracts for citrus groves. Half of his land was for commercial use while the other half was divided into tiny strips and sold to the public.  He founded the Florida town of Howey and became its mayor in 1925 (after which it was renamed Howey-in-the-Hills). He built a couple of hotels and an iconic mansion (now a popular wedding venue). Visitors to the little resort town would stay in Howey’s hotel right next to the citrus groves. Anyone who inquired about the groves became a potential town of Howey-in-the-Hills investor. These prospects were pitched on buying the land from Howey’s companies.  Part of the purchase agreement was to have Howey’s companies develop and service the acquired plot in order to grow and sell citrus fruits for profit. Profits would then be split between Howey’s companies and its investors. Howey died in 1938, but his companies carried on.  A few years later, the SEC accused the companies of selling unregistered securities. The case was eventually brought before the U.S. Supreme Court in May 1946. Writing for the majority, Justice Frank Murphy determined that Howey’s land sales contracts qualified as securities in the form of investment contracts as per the Securities Act of 1933.  The Howey Test  In his opinion, Justice Murphy took it upon himself to craft a definition of the term “investment contract” (the term is used but not defined in the law). An investment contract means a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.  The definition has four distinct components, or “prongs”:  1. An investment of money  2. In a common enterprise  3. With an expectation of profits  4. Solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party  If an asset meets these four criteria it’s deemed an investment contract and thus a security. Even if an asset doesn’t quite meet the criteria, it may still be deemed a security based on economic realities – the totality of circumstances under which a business transaction occurs.  Read more: A 'Howey Test' for Blockchain? Why the SEC's ICO Guidance Isn't Enough  Adam Levitin’s argument  Levitin argues that a proof-of-stake system like Ethereum requires an investment of money (staking) in a common enterprise (Ethereum) with an expectation of profits (staking rewards) primarily from the efforts of others (other Ethereum participants).  He uses the phrase “primarily from the efforts of others” instead of Justice Murphy’s “solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.”  “Courts of Appeals have read ‘solely’ as being more like ‘primarily’ or ‘significantly,’” Levitin wrote.  However, Levitin acknowledges the significance of the latter part of Justice Murphy’s definition which references a “promoter” – the third-party entity shilling the investment contract and responsible for most of the profit-generating activity. Who would that be in the Ethereum ecosystem?  “None of this answers the trickier question of who the ‘issuer’ is when you're dealing with a decentralized system. But that's part of the broader problem of how to fit decentralized systems into a person-based legal system,” Levitin tweeted.  Counterarguments  Whodunit?  The most convincing counterargument to Levitin’s position may be the one he alluded to himself. If Ethereum is a truly decentralized network, who’s the third-party promoter? Former SEC regulator William Hinman’s comments in 2018 seem to undermine ETH’s risk of being branded a security on this basis.  “As a network becomes truly decentralized, the ability to identify an issuer or promoter to make the requisite disclosures becomes difficult, and less meaningful,” Hinman said. He was the SEC’s corporation finance director at the time. However, the SEC has not referenced nor acknowledged Hinman’s remarks since he made them.  What pool?  Levitin pointed out that proof-of-stake allows stakers to invest in validation pools where others perform the actual hashing, or processing transactions using a cryptographic algorithm. This goes back to his interpretation of the third and fourth prongs of Howey – expecting profits from the efforts of others.  Tim Beiko, who runs protocol support for the Ethereum Foundation, counter-tweeted to explain that Ethereum has no “validation pools” at the protocol level. More importantly, Beiko suggests that the proof-of-stake hashing Levitin referred to is nowhere near as computationally intense as proof-of-work hashing. Therefore, it shouldn’t be categorized as “efforts of others,” Beiko argued.  Levitin’s validation  Once a security, always a security?  Ethereum was funded by an $18 million initial coin offering (ICO). Hinman implied in his 2018 remarks that ether may have been a security at its debut but by then had become sufficiently decentralized to where it was unlikely an investment contract anymore.  “Putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of ether, based on my understanding … current offers and sales of ether are not securities transactions,” Hinman said.  Read more: Ethereum Launches Long-Awaited Decentralized App Network  If indeed ether was originally a security, couldn’t one make the argument that factors such as the extent of decentralization and the type of consensus mechanism are dials that move ether along a security-commodity continuum?  That would potentially strengthen Levitin’s argument that, although ether has achieved sufficient decentralization to be conferred commodity status, the switch to proof-of-stake could pull it back into the security zone.  Does the Ethereum Foundation operate like a software company?  A popular Twitter account recently posted a thread on how the Ethereum Foundation uses a so-called difficulty bomb to “coerce” developers into accepting hard forks initiated by the foundation. The “bomb” is a function that makes it exponentially harder to successfully mine ether on the original chain until mining becomes practically impossible.  Hard forks are network upgrades that are not backwards-compatible (you either accept the changes or split off onto a separate blockchain). Soft forks are changes to a blockchain that are backwards-compatible (you can continue using the network whether or not you accept the changes).  With a difficulty bomb hanging over their heads, miners have two choices – go along with the foundation’s proposed hard fork or start a new project (which also requires a hard fork).  Read more: Ethereum's Gray Glacier (or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Difficulty Bomb)  This suggests the Ethereum Foundation is controlling the direction of the network. If so, the foundation could potentially be seen as a third-party promoter under the Howey Test, supporting Levitin’s argument.  A world where ETH is a security  In an interview with CoinDesk TV, Levitin explained potential ramifications if ether becomes a security.  Essentially, smaller decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, especially those outside the United States, may continue to operate. Even if these projects run afoul of U.S. securities laws, Levitin said the SEC would be less likely to deploy its limited enforcement resources to convict them when big centralized organizations make easier targets.  The biggest change may be in the regulation of centralized exchanges. Currently, exchanges need only to register as money services businesses at the federal level and obtain money transmitter licenses in the states where they operate to facilitate spot ETH trading. A securities designation would bring them under the additional authority of the SEC.  At a minimum, that would mean new business models for exchanges and more complex transactions for customers. Many other downstream effects would likely manifest.  Today, cryptocurrency exchanges perform brokerage, clearinghouse and exchange functions under one roof (exchanges are asset marketplaces, brokerages facilitate transactions by connecting buyers and sellers and clearinghouses settle trades). If firms like Coinbase (COIN) and Kraken were to be regulated as securities exchanges, Levitin said, they would have to separate each of those three functions.  “If they have to register as securities exchanges with the SEC, they’re probably going to have to divest those different lines of business because there are just too many conflicts of interest when you’re wearing all three hats,” Levitin said.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | FORKS,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/08/10/whats-at-stake-will-the-merge-turn-ether-into-a-security,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0bc3836c0f92b0562eebbb07ebc1696054add1b9-4864x3648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421830,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwAKT,1660156555,How Does MakerDAO Work? Understanding the 'Central Bank of Crypto',"After the collapse of Terra’s USD in the middle of 2022, algorithmic stablecoins earned a bad rap. It looked like the value of these coins was dependent on little more than hot air. But one of the oldest and most stable decentralized stablecoins, MakerDAO’s DAI, managed to sail through the pandemonium.  DAI’s advocates would argue that it shows that decentralized stablecoins can work when they are designed properly. Its critics would say that DAI isn’t that decentralized of a stablecoin at all. Although it is backed by cryptocurrencies, it is backed in no small part by centralized stablecoins, especially USDC.  So what to make of MakerDAO? Is it really the central bank of crypto or a shining beacon in truly decentralized governance? Read on to find out more.  What is MakerDAO and how does it work?  MakerDAO is a lending platform that was launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain. It powers a decentralized stablecoin called DAI. DAI is pegged to the U.S. dollar, which is useful when crypto’s financers want to exchange more volatile cryptocurrencies for a coin that’s worth something relatively stable.  The protocol works by allowing anyone to take out loans in DAI using other cryptocurrencies as collateral. Crucially, these loans are overcollateralized, meaning that you will have to deposit more cryptocurrency than you put in. As of August 2022, the minimum collateralization rate of a “vault” of ETH is 170%, meaning that you would have to collateralize $170,000 worth of ETH to receive $100,000 worth of DAI.  The reason for overcollateralization is to protect against crashes of ETH or the other coins that back DAI, which include wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) and centralized U.S. dollar stablecoins USDC and USDP.  As of this writing in August 2022, DAI is backed by $10.6 billion worth of crypto assets and a smattering of real-world assets, such as $100 million from Huntington Valley Bank. It is overcollateralized at a ratio of 141%, according to data from Daistats.com.     The greater the collateral, the more these cryptocurrencies would have to fall in value before DAI loses parity with the U.S. dollar.  What motivates users to lock up more than they borrow?  The lender-borrower structure seems to be great for MakerDAO, but why would anyone want to borrow less than they lock up? The main reason is that by borrowing DAI (as opposed to buying it), an investor would be able to access a U.S. dollar stablecoin without having to sell his or her ETH. This is useful because many yield farms and lending platforms offer higher returns for U.S. dollar stablecoins than for ETH itself. DAI can be converted back to ETH at any time.  There’s also another token within MakerDAO’s network, which is MakerDAO’s governance token, Maker (MKR). The token is used primarily to vote on protocol updates within the platform. As of August 2022, MKR had a market capitalization of about $1.1 billion.  Then there’s the Dai Savings Rate (DSR), which is a savings protocol that issues returns to those who lock up DAI in the DSR’s smart contract. This lets those within Maker’s governance module influence the demand for DAI by changing the levers of the protocol’s monetary policy, just like a centralized bank.  So far, DAI’s done remarkably well, rising from a market capitalization of $100 million in early 2020 to a peak of $10 billion in February 2022, before falling to $6.4 billion in May 2022 after the crypto market crashed. As of August 2022, DAI’s market cap was $7.5 billion.  MakerDAO’s governance  Part of MakerDAO’s success isn't in its algorithmic design, but in its decentralized governance. Those with lots of MKR all but saved DAI from collapse in March 2020 after the pandemic shook the token to its core.  To prevent it from falling below $1, the decentralized autonomous organization voted to back the stablecoin with USDC, a centralized stablecoin maintained by Centre, a consortium led by payment company Circle and crypto exchange Coinbase. Since then, DAI has also added USDP to the mix. These stablecoins are distinctly centralized as they are run by companies and backed by USD and equivalents held in banks.  More generally, the governance protocol works to update the protocol through a series of time-based polls. These votes take place directly on the blockchain, and MKR tokens are the currency of the ballot. If a resolution passes, it’s binding.

Co-founders Lucas Ferreira of Lightning Labs and André Neves of ZEBEDEE will serve as the foundation’s executive director and director of partnerships, respectively.  Vinteum’s mission is to train and fund open-source developers across Brazil and Latin America to work on Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, an area that has become critical in recent years as bitcoin matures beyond hobbyist use cases.  Vinteum’s first cohort of sponsors includes institutional investor John Pfeffer of Pfeffer Capital; Xapo Bank founder and early Bitcoin champion Wences Casares; Sebastian Serrano, CEO and co-founder of Bitcoin blockchain company Ripio; crypto-exchange Okcoin; and the Human Rights Foundation (HRF). The total amount in funds that Vinteum now holds is undisclosed.  In addition to announcing its launch, Vinteum named its first grantee, Bruno Garcia. Garcia is a Bitcoin Core developer and a Brink grant recipient. Garcia will act as Vinteum’s director of education, dedicating himself to educating promising developers while also continuing his technical contributions to Bitcoin, which include reviewing and testing pull requests, extending and improving test coverage, and working on improvements for the peer-to-peer wallet and REST API modules.  Brazil experienced an economic crisis when hyperinflation took hold in the early 1990s. As such, bitcoin supporters in Brazil have taken root – given the cryptocurrency’s sound money principles.  Likewise, across Latin America, countries including Argentina and Venezuela are in the throes of hyperinflation. On top of that, bitcoin is viewed favorably in Argentina, according to survey data from Block.

42394966,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWedC,1660151999,"US Senators Warren, Sanders Ask Key Bank Regulator to Rescind Crypto Guidance","U.S Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) asked the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to rescind interpretative letters allowing banks to engage in crypto activities and explain how involved banks are becoming in crypto.  In an open letter addressed to Acting Comptroller Michael Hsu, the lawmakers said they were concerned that several interpretative letters published in 2020 and 2021 under former Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks (now CEO of crypto company Bitfury) that allowed banks to provide crypto custody services, issue payments with stablecoins, bank stablecoin issuers and engage in other crypto-related activities ""essentially granted banks unfettered opportunity"" to engage in problematic crypto activities. The interpretative letters, which also includes one published during Hsu's tenure, did not address any of the risks tied to crypto banking activities, the lawmakers said.  ""Given the risks posed by cryptocurrencies to banks and their customers, we request that you withdraw OCC Interpretive Letters 1170, 1172, 1174, and 1179 and coordinate with the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to develop a comprehensive approach that adequately protects consumers and the safety and soundness of the banking system,"" the letter said.  The OCC issued these letters between July 2020 and January 2021, when Brooks helmed the regulatory agency. At the time the crypto industry saw the guidance letters as potentially aiding mainstream adoption of crypto by letting regulated institutions – banks – become more involved in the industry.  Crypto activities do not have much in the way of retail protections, the lawmakers said, pointing to the collapse of Terra and Three Arrows Capital, and the bankruptcies of Celsius Network and Voyager Digital.  ""While you declared that 'there has been no contagion from cryptocurrencies to traditional banking and finance' during this recent market turmoil, it is clear that stronger protections are necessary to mitigate crypto’s risks to the financial system and consumers,"" the lawmakers said.  The senators also asked a series of questions about how many banks have been approved to engage in crypto activities, what kinds of services those banks provide, the dollar volumes the banks hold tied to crypto and whether any of these banks are involved in other crypto-related activities such as trading derivatives.

42394957,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWeWJ,1660148721,"NFT Collections Will Be Regulated Like Cryptocurrencies Under EU’s MiCA Law, Official Says","SEOUL, South Korea — Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are part of a collection will have to apply new European Union crypto rules intended to warn investors of risks, an official told attendees at Korea Blockchain Week on Tuesday.  The remarks come in spite of previous claims that the innovative ownership tokens would be excluded from the bloc’s newly agreed Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) law. The EU struck a political deal on MiCA at the end of June – and how to treat NFTs, which offer a tradable, digital way to prove ownership of assets such as artworks, was a major sticking point in talks until the last moment.  Though the deal settled the major political elements of the law, no text is yet available. In theory, according to official declarations, the final draft of the law exempts NFTs unless they constitute some other kind of crypto asset. In practice, remarks from the European Commission’s Peter Kerstens suggest that a carve-out might provide scant relief.  Read more: Crypto World Is Cautious of Finer Details in EU's MiCA Law  EU legislators “take a very narrow view of what is an NFT,” said Kerstens – who is adviser for technological innovation at the commission’s financial-services arm – implying few assets will benefit from the exemption.  “If a token is issued as a collection or as a series – even though the issuer may call it an NFT and even though each individual token in that series may be unique – it's not considered to be an NFT, so the requirements will apply,” Kerstens said.  That would mean issuers of NFT collections have to publish a white paper setting out details of the protocol used by the NFTs, and would be forbidden from making outlandish promises about future value that could mislead people into buying, he added.  EU national governments felt that including NFTs in MiCA would be an unjustified extension of a bill originally designed to protect investors in stablecoins and initial coin offerings. But lawmakers from the European Parliament, who also had to sign off on the legislative deal, were more hawkish, arguing the NFT market is prone to securities-style price manipulation such as wash trading.  Kerstens himself had previously said it would be “silly” to require a white paper – a lengthy regulatory document broadly equivalent to the prospectus drafted for stocks – for every NFT. The idea that NFT platforms like OpenSea might have to seek regulatory authorization had provoked worries about crushing innovation in the nascent industry.  The European Commission, broadly the EU’s executive arm, proposed the first draft of MiCA back in 2020. Since then it has brokered talks in the EU’s Council and Parliament as they amended the law.

42421832,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwAMX,1660146892,Coinbase 101: What You Need to Know About the Crypto Exchange and Wallet,"Coinbase (COIN) is the largest crypto exchange by volume in the U.S., and is the world’s largest publicly traded crypto company. The exchange has made headlines with partnerships from the National Basketball Association to Meta (META) and most recently, BlackRock (BLK).  Coinbase is a centralized exchange, meaning it monitors transactions and secures assets on your behalf. As of writing, Coinbase offers support for buying, selling and storing over 200 cryptocurrencies including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and other digital assets.  Beyond the exchange, Coinbase also offers a wallet, a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace and an institutional offering, Coinbase Prime.  What makes Coinbase different from other exchanges?  There are certain features that make Coinbase stand out from other exchanges on the market. Here are some of them:  Top-tier security: Coinbase focuses resources on maintaining the security of its customers and its network. Contrary to many cryptocurrency exchanges, Coinbase has not experienced major hacks that compromised its consumers' portfolios. Some of its most stringent security protocols are its two-factor authentication and a state-of-the-art encryption engine.  Cold storage: 98% of customer assets are stored offline using cold storage wallets that are not connected to the internet.  Crime Insurance: The policy protects Coinbase if it undergoes a hack, theft or breach on its crypto storages resulting in loss of digital assets.  24/7 customer support: Apart from these, Coinbase also offers customer support on multiple channels and has a user-friendly interface.  Learn-to-earn crypto program: The app offers the opportunity to take courses about specific cryptocurrencies and earn rewards in that crypto for correctly answering quizzes.  Getting started with Coinbase  If you’re looking to open a Coinbase account, either download the app or go to coinbase.com in your browser and follow these steps:  Create an account: The first step is to create a Coinbase account. You'll need to provide your name, email address and create a password.  U.S. customers will need to verify their state of residence and enter a phone number to set up two-factor authentication (2FA).  Verify your identity: Next, you'll need to verify your identity by filling out some basic personal information and (for U.S. customers) the last four digits of your Social Security number.  Choose your payment method: Now you'll need to choose how you want to pay for your cryptocurrencies. You can at this point close out of the onboarding process and browse the platform to check it out. But if you do want to buy or sell crypto on Coinbase, you will need to connect a payment method such as a bank account, debit or gift card or set up a wire transfer.  Start buying and selling: Once you've added a payment method, you're ready to start buying and selling cryptocurrencies. Coinbase makes it easy to buy popular coins including bitcoin, ether and dogecoin.  Coinbase wallet  In addition to being a popular crypto exchange, Coinbase offers a wallet for storing your cryptocurrencies.  The Coinbase Wallet is available for both iOS and Android devices, and it's one of the most popular cryptocurrency wallets, surpassing over 10 million downloads. The wallet is secure and easy to use.  The wallet is a non-custodial (also known as a self-custody) wallet in which you keep control over your crypto and security keys. It is a hot wallet, which means it is connected directly to the internet.  Read more: Hot vs. Cold Crypto Storage: What Are the Differences?  Coinbase NFT marketplace  Coinbase launched its NFT marketplace on May 4, 2022, allowing users to buy, sell and collect NFTs on its Ethereum-based platform and aims to build an active community of buyers and sellers. Some of the NFT collectibles available are Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks, as seen in Coinbase's Trending section.  The marketplace is compatible with both the Coinbase wallet and MetaMask wallets. There is a maximum of 10 addresses that can be connected to your marketplace account.  In regards to its fee structure, a buyer or seller needs to be mindful of gas (transaction) fees on the Ethereum network. As network congestion is determined by the number of transactions happening during a specific time period, gas fees will fluctuate. You generally will pay less in gas fees if you are willing to slow the transaction time.  Some of the creative works in the marketplace include:  Art  Music  Videos  Games  It is important to note that the Coinbase NFT marketplace is currently in beta, which means it is still undergoing user and usability testing.

42421826,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwAFJ,1660146243,Are Crypto Mixers Legal?,"On August 8, 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned crypto-mixer Tornado Cash – which was founded in 2019 – for its use in several money-laundering schemes that totaled $7 billion. The service is a virtual currency mixer, also known as a crypto blender, that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. It facilitates anonymous transactions by jumbling up data on the origin, destination and parties involved in a crypto transaction.  Crypto mixers are designed to protect user privacy, but the Treasury Department says that many services “are commonly used by illicit actors to launder funds, especially those stolen during significant heists.” The reality is that crypto mixers have been connected to several major hacks, casting a shadow over their other use cases.  How do crypto mixers work?  Most cryptocurrency transactions are recorded on a public ledger called a blockchain, where the movement of funds from one wallet address to another is logged and visible to anyone. Cryptocurrency mixers aim to make it harder to track individual transactions by mixing the source funds with other funds, resulting in an amalgamated deposit that is more difficult to trace.  Let's look at how this would work with bitcoin. You could use a centralized mixer, which are third-party services that receive bitcoin, stir in other bitcoin from other deposits, and send back an equivalent amount of bitcoin at the end of the transaction. These services typically take a transaction fee, and while they obscure the public origin and destination of crypto payments, the company may still maintain a record that can link transactions together.  Decentralized mixers do not use an intermediary to complete a transaction, and instead, use open-source protocols like CoinJoin. Essentially, users can blend their coins into a larger transaction and receive an equal amount of crypto in the end, making it difficult to trace where the payment originated from.  Tornado Cash, for example, is a decentralized, open-source protocol for private transactions on the Ethereum network. Tornado Cash deploys smart contracts that allow users to deposit ether or an ERC-20 token to one address and enable withdrawal from another address. After depositing, the company advises users to “wait some amount of time” before withdrawing their funds to “improve their privacy.”  Are cryptocurrency blenders legal?  Crypto mixers are not inherently illegal, though they are used for illegal activity. According to a July report from Chainalysis, cryptocurrency mixers are a “go-to tool for cybercriminals dealing in cryptocurrency” and illicit addresses account for nearly a quarter of funds sent to mixers since January.  In the U.S., the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) considers mixers to be money transmitters under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) that need to be registered and meet certain requirements. Chainalysis, however, noted in its report that it is “not aware of any bitcoin or Ethereum mixers currently following these rules.”  Notable hacks using crypto blenders  In January, Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Semenov told CoinDesk that privacy protocols “are defending people’s rights to financial privacy.” But some of these mixers have been linked to large-scale hacks and money laundering, and several popular blender tools have already been flagged by the U.S. for their association with cybercrime:  Blender.io, a bitcoin mixer, was the first of its kind ever sanctioned by the OFAC. The service is said to have been used by North Korean state-sponsored hackers Lazarus Group in a large-scale hack on the online game Axie Infinity in March 2022, resulting in losses of about $620 million. According to the OFAC, Blender.io was used in processing $20.5 million of the illicit funds.  Helix, a darknet bitcoin mixer, was the first bitcoin mixer penalized by FinCEN in October 2020 for violating anti-money-laundering laws. Larry Dean Harmon, the service’s founder, was ordered to pay a $60 million civil penalty and pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to launder monetary instruments. Between July 2014 and its shutdown in December 2017, Helix is reported to have processed 354,468 BTC.  Bitcoin Fog, another bitcoin mixer, was labeled by the Department of Justice as the “longest-running bitcoin money-laundering service on the darknet.” Dual Russian-Swedish national Roman Sterlingov was arrested in April 2021 and is alleged to have laundered $336 million in bitcoin since the service's launch in 2011.  Tornado Cash, an Ethereum mixer, was used to launder more than $96 million in malicious funds derived from the June 2022 attack on Harmony’s Horizon bridge, and at least $7.8 million from a hack of cross-chain bridge Nomad, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. In addition, Singapore-based Cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com was hacked in January, and on-chain data from PeckShield suggested that 4,600 ETH in stolen funds were laundered through Tornado Cash.  Some exchanges, including Paxos, have flagged the use of mixers as a way to ensure users are “not engaged in money-laundering or other illicit activities.”  Privacy considerations  Ultimately, crypto mixers are a tool that can be used to enhance user privacy and make cryptocurrency transactions more anonymous. This may be helpful for people looking to make their transaction history more private or prefer an added layer of protection from third parties that may have access to their personal information.  Nonetheless, some mixers have long been used by malicious parties to launder money, and may not adhere to regulatory obligations laid out by FinCEN. Some mixers also have a minimum and maximum limit per transaction and can vary in their legitimacy, and ability to obscure financial transactions.  There are alternatives to mixers, including privacy-oriented cryptocurrencies, such as monero, that use stealth addresses, among other measures, to hide the sender, receiver and amount per transaction. Privacy wallets like Wasabi Wallet, which generates a new address for every transaction, can also be used to facilitate private transactions, though Elliptic previously reported that at least 13% of all proceeds from crime in bitcoin, roughly $160 million, were sent through privacy wallets in 2020.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | REGULATION,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/are-crypto-mixers-legal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d76a5059e4ea2c0598cd0183ff55682257e1f6d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Court documents unsealed Aug. 10 allege that Shahram Poursafi, a Tehran-based member of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard offered as much as $300,000 to assassinate Bolton, and $1 million for a further, unspecified job, with the transfer apparently set to be made via digital currency.  According to those documents, Poursafi in late 2021 and early 2022 made contact with a U.S. intermediary via encrypted messaging and instructed the would-be assassin to open a crypto wallet, to which small payments were then made as proof of concept.  The move comes as authorities attempt to clamp down on the use of crypto to launder the proceeds of crime, using a controversial means of identifying payers known as the travel rule. Indeed, the U.S. Treasury Department earlier this week blocked access to Tornado Cash, arguing that the privacy-focused mixing service was linked to sanctions-busting and North Korean hackers.

42421120,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZUUf,1660144028,"Tornado Cash Ban May Not Stop Bad Actors but Could Put a Dent in Their Efforts, Former DEA Agent Says","The U.S. Treasury Department’s sanctioning of mixing service Tornado Cash sounds the alarm that the U.S. is taking mixers seriously, according to retired Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) agent William Callahan.  Callahan, who now works as the director of government and strategic affairs at software company Blockchain Intelligence Group, told CoinDesk TV that while the ban may not completely stop cryptocurrency money laundering, it sends a bigger message and at least “will put a great dent into their operations.”  On Monday, the mixer was added to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list for allegedly aiding and abetting the laundering of more than $7 billion worth of cryptocurrencies.  In a statement, the Treasury Department said the mixer was used by North Korean hacking group Lazarus Group to steal $455 million through several exploits, including $7.8 million laundered via Nomad’s crypto bridge last week.  Under the department's new designation, all Americans are banned from being able to send or receive money on the platform and could face criminal penalties for violating the rules.  Callahan suggested the move, though harsh, represents a new regime for U.S. regulators who combat financial crime. Armed with new analytics tools, law enforcement agencies are better able to track bad actors and beat them at their own game, he said.  The ban, however, could be hard for officials to completely implement, Callahan said.  “The bad guys have an advantage over law enforcement,” he said, including “money to come up with different techniques” to evade surveillance systems.  Tornado Cash, which is built on the Ethereum blockchain, lets users accept token deposits from one address and make withdrawals using a different address. Effectively, it means the platform mixes coins, making it harder to track which transactions are being used for criminal activity.  The non-custodial mixer, like crypto, is built around pseudo-anonymity, which poses concerns for officials, too. And because the platform is open source, the question of whether the code will be duplicated at different Ethereum addresses remains unclear.  Callahan emphasized that the mixer is a “threat to national security.” And while it may not be the first time U.S. officials implement such measures to “affect financial flow,” it may be a period for platforms to slow down and review their current transaction processes.  As many others have, Callahan noted the sweeping ban affects users of the platform who rely on the protocol for legitimate reasons. That includes people around the world under autocratic regimes, or everyday crypto users who choose not to reveal their transaction history.  Elliptic, a blockchain analytics company, found that only $1.5 billion in crypto tied to illicit acts moved through the platform – not the $7 billion figure the U.S. government cited.  Callahan acknowledges that while there are places around the world where users need privacy, in the U.S. at the present moment, “the government has a responsibility to take action when they see that this could pose threats to national security.”  Read more: US Government Amps Up Inevitable Clash With Crypto Privacy in Tornado Cash Blacklisting",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/10/tornado-cash-ban-may-not-stop-bad-actors-but-could-put-a-dent-in-their-efforts-former-dea-agent-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d5f2535632a68917c6eaaf7da396ffdbb671be2f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395003,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWhWG,1660141503,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Jumps After Core CPI for July Comes In Lower Than Expected,"Price Point: BTC and ETH jumped in the minutes after the release of consumer price index for July, which was lower than predicted.  Market Moves: The market share of bitcoin and stablecoins continues to fall as traders appear to be more comfortable with exposure to riskier cryptocurrencies.  Chart of The Day: Ether's key price indicator turns bullish.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price point  Bitcoin (BTC) jumped 2% to about $23,500 in the minutes after the U.S. consumer-price inflation data for July was released. The core CPI was unchanged with an increase of 5.9%, compared with the expected 6.1% growth, a relief for markets.  Futures tied to the major U.S. stock indexes rose after the report. S&P 500 futures were up 1.7%, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained 1.3%.  Ether (ETH) also rose 4% to $1,780 after the data was released. Laurent Kssis, head of Europe at Hashdex, a crypto asset management firm, said he thinks that this might be a key support level for the cryptocurrency for a $2,000 target by the end of August.  Altcoins performed well Wednesday with fantom (FTM) up 8% and AAVE up 6%.  “We increasingly seem to be entering a transitional period. Until recently, it was clear that most investors considered the market to be in the throes of a crypto winter, but this narrative is no longer as clearly defined,” Jason Deane, an analyst at Quantum Economics, said.  Deane points to indicators in the market showing a possibility of a recovery, including “some soft indicators, such as the Fear & Greed Index as well as hard indicators such as volume transactions on exchanges, miner sell rates and even Lightning Network capacity data.” The Lightning Network is a platform used to process crypto transactions.  “That said, bitcoin is still very much traded by markets as a commodity and its price is still closely aligned with external market data,” Deane said. “As a result, the influence of these factors can often offset asset-specific data and that may well be what we're seeing here.”  Musk sells Tesla shares  In the news, Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk sold 7.92 million shares of the company, according to regulatory filings.  Musk, who has been meme cryptocurrency dogecoin’s highest-profile supporter, confirmed the shares had been sold via a tweet. Responding to a tweet asking if the shares were sold, the billionaire replied “yes. In the (hopefully unlikely) event that Twitter forces this deal to close *and* some equity partners don’t come through, it is important to avoid an emergency sale of Tesla stock.”  The sales has left him with a 15% stake in Tesla. Its stock was down 2.5% Wednesday morning.  Coinbase sued  A new lawsuit alleges that crypto exchange Coinbase executives misled shareholders about its public listing. A Coinbase shareholder is seeking damages from nine company executives and board members, CoinDesk’s Sandali Handagama reports.  Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN) have fallen about 5% after the exchange said trading volume dropped substantially during the second quarter. According to a shareholder letter released Tuesday, customer trading activity amounted to $217 billion during the quarter, down from $309 billion in the first quarter.  Still, Bank of America said in a research report that the exchange is in a good position to take market share during this crypto winter. It maintained a buy recommendation on the stock after the company posted its second-quarter results.  JPMorgan is less optimistic in the near term, saying the crypto exchange's near-term outlook is “still grim.”  Crypto trading platform expands in Latin America  Mercado Libre, Latin America’s largest e-commerce company by market value, plans to expand its crypto trading feature across the region after a successful start in Brazil.  In December, users of Mercado Pago, Mercado Libre’s digital wallet, were allowed to buy and sell bitcoin, ether and the stablecoin pax dollar (USDP) in Brazil after an integration with Paxos blockchain infrastructure.  Mercado Libre didn't say which countries were next in line for the product or any tentative launch dates, Andres Engler reports.

Crypto indexes have seen positive returns so far in August, with the small-cap index leading the way with a 9% increase. Mid-caps are up 7%, and large-caps are up 5%. Bitcoin has risen 2%.  As bitcoin underperforms altcoins, bitcoin's share of the overall crypto market by market capitalization has dropped to 40.5% from a peak of 47% in mid-June.  “As the market sentiment has improved, traders have been more interested in getting exposure to altcoins than bitcoin,” the Arcane Research report said.  “As the market has gotten hungrier for risk, we also see the market shares of stablecoins plummeting,” the report stated. Since the middle of June, the market share of the USDT stablecoin has fallen to 5.9% from 8.1%.  Chart of the Day: Ether's Key Price Indicator Turns Bullish  By Omkar Godbole  The weekly chart MACD (moving average convergence/divergence) histogram crossed above zero last week, indicating a bullish shift in the momentum.  According to Fairlead Strategies managing director Katie Stockton, ether now needs to clear resistance at $1,733. That would validate the MACD's bullish flip and open the doors for a continued rally toward the 200-day average at $2,250.  ""If ether clears $1,733 decisively and confirms a weekly MACD 'buy' signal, that would support an extended relief rally, with secondary resistance near the 200-day MA,"" Stockton said in a weekly analytics note published on Aug. 1.

Shares of the crypto exchange rebounded from a loss in premarket trading to a gain of about 3% at the open after bitcoin prices jumped following the U.S. inflation report.  Wall Street analysts lowered expectations ahead of Coinbase’s second-quarter earnings report, although they weren’t quite ready to call the bottom for the shares as uncertainty lingers over the crypto and broader market.  Read more: Coinbase Shares Drop as Crypto Winter Takes Toll on Exchange's Trading Volume  Cash burn  “COIN’s 2Q22 report was most noteworthy for what it did not include,” BTIG analyst Mark Palmer told clients in a note, adding that investors had expressed concerns amid the company’s potential cash burn and loss of retail users. “The size of COIN’s cash burn during 2Q22 did not set off alarm bells,” Palmer wrote. BTIG reiterated a buy rating, lowering its price target to $220 from $290.  Coinbase’s current cash position of $6.2 billion may fall to about $5 billion by the end of 2023 even under current crypto market conditions, according to MoffettNathanson. “As a result, as long as the company makes no major changes to its operating activities (e.g., no significant M&A), Coinbase should have plenty of cash to withstand even a protracted crypto downturn,” analyst Lisa Ellis said in a note. She maintained an outperform rating and a $200 price target.  Next steps  Coinbase may yet face some challenges in regard to customer activity under current macroeconomic conditions. The company, however, will be working to diversify its revenue base and hold the line during the crypto winter.  ""We believe the crypto fallout in 1H22 has shaken out many tourists,"" Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau said in a note to clients. ""The remaining investors are long-term believers in the stock/digital assets, forming a strong base and are less sensitive to near term volume."" The firm maintained an outperform rating and $108 price target, citing a longer-term outlook on Coinbase's Web 3 plans.  “Following a severe drop in asset prices, it is not surprising to see a bit of paralysis in customer engagement, particularly in trading as investors assess where we go from here,” JMP Securities' Devin Ryan told clients in a note. “Pinpointing the moment of inflection is difficult, but we continue to have conviction that Coinbase remains incredibly well positioned to benefit as the pendulum moves back into the middle, which we believe it inevitably will.” Ryan has a market outperform rating on Coinbase, and lowered the price target to $195 from $205.

Unstoppable Finance To Launch &apos;Ultimate&apos; Wallet The Berlin-based startup Unstoppable Finance recently secured $12.8 million in funding. The funding round included the participation of Rockaway Blockchain Fund, Speedinvest, Inflection, Backed VC, Fabric Ventures, Anagram, and Discovery Ventures. The &apos;Ultimate&apos; wallet by Unstoppable Finance focuses on delivering a smooth user experience, as seen in fintech apps, to attract crypto-enthusiastic retail investors. The team hopes to attract more users with a more user-friendly interface than crypto-native offerings such as MetaMask and Phantom. Ultimate is a wallet that allows users the power to hold crypto assets and the option to access private keys without an intermediary.

In the app, the users can easily access the protocols. However, the existing services require users manually connect with the protocols they want to access.

42394988,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWhNP,1660137640,Blockchain Payments Platform Ansible Labs Raises $7M in Seed Funding Round,"Ansible Labs, a startup that is building a payments platform for blockchain accounts, has raised $7 million in a seed funding round that was led by early-stage crypto venture capital firm Archetype.  The capital will go toward hiring, liquidity and operating expenses ahead of the launch of the project's first product, according to a fundraising deck provided to CoinDesk.  “We see off-ramp as a missing piece in the puzzle that is mainstream Web3 adoption and usage,” Ansible Labs co-founder and CEO Daniel Mottice told CoinDesk in an email.  The Ansible team has ties to global payments provider Visa, Mottice was product lead for Visa Crypto and helped build and launch Visa Direct Payouts, a service that allows financial institutions to push out payments to accounts around the world. Ansible co-founder and Chief Product Officer Matt Vanhouten also worked at Visa Direct and has a background in traditional finance with stints at Wells Fargo and JPMorgan & Chase.  ""We're ecstatic to support Dan and the Ansible team in building a pillar company at the intersection of fintech and crypto,"" Ash Egan, a general partner at Archetype, said. ""Ansible is solving a critical need only growing in importance as more businesses come on-chain and the creator economy in Web3 hits its stride.""  Other participants in the funding round included Castle Island Ventures, A* Partners, Arca, Soma Capital, Plural VC and Eniac Ventures.  The Web3 on-boarding process, also called an ""on-ramp,"" requires a user to set up a cryptocurrency wallet and send fiat currency to that wallet in order to purchase the crypto needed to interact with non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and other blockchain-based programs.  Withdrawing the crypto back into fiat is called an off-ramp. While both on-ramp and off-ramp processes come with technical and regulatory complexities, Ansible Labs sees off-ramps as an underserved market.  ”We see off-ramp as a key primitive that will enable Web3 businesses, creators, artists, DAO contributors and developers to more seamlessly explore and use Web3 without the headache of figuring out how to cash out their on-chain value to fiat when they need to speed value in the real world,” Mottice said.  The first product from Ansible Labs is Beam, an off-ramp product with multi-chain support for non-custodial wallets that can be used directly through a Web3 app with bank-grade compliance. Beam will be released this fall, and Ansible then plans to expand the capabilities of the product so that Web3 companies can directly integrate the customizable off-ramp prodcut into their products  Read more: Custodial Wallets vs. Non-Custodial Crypto Wallets  “The theme of programmable money need not only apply to crypto, and with seamless value transfer, fluidity and configurability between fiat and crypto, we believe that crypto payments can realize their full potential,” Mottice said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | TRADING,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/08/10/blockchain-payments-platform-ansible-labs-founded-by-visa-alums-raises-7m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ccd005d63a0d36bb0f929b4b4a0ead31594ba8fa-3109x2332.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394987,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWhMQ,1660136400,Elliptic Introduces Product to Track Crypto Flows Across all Blockchains in Single Screening,"Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic said Wednesday that it can now track crypto movements across and between all blockchains concurrently and in a matter of milliseconds.  Elliptic’s new analytics offering, called Holistic Screening, can be a game changer for companies looking to ensure compliance with regulators, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk. Holistic Screening will also speed up the tracking of stolen fund across multiple blockchains, which are usually processed through cross-chain bridges, the statement added.  “The way in which crypto is used has shifted. Individual crypto assets and blockchains are no longer isolated systems and have become part of a larger, interconnected crypto economy,” Tom Robinson, co-founder and chief scientist at Elliptic, said.  Decentralized cross-chain bridges, which serve as unregulated alternatives to crypto exchanges for transferring funds between blockchains, are hotbeds for illicit activity. Blockchain sleuth Chainalysis estimates that around $2 billion has been stolen via cross-chain bridges this year.  According to Elliptic’s own research, one such bridge called RenBridge has facilitated the laundering of at least $540 million worth of illicit funds, with around a third of those funds believed to have been stolen by North Korean hackers.  Regulators are cracking down on these systems. On Monday, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned crypto mixer Tornado Cash, a tool that can obscure the source of funds, which was used to launder tens of millions of dollars’ worth of crypto stolen from the cross-chain bridge Ronin earlier this year.  Many analytics firms provide cross-chain analytics services, but Robinson says Elliptic’s product is automated and scalable, which can beat time-consuming manual investigations.  “This is in contrast to current 'cross-chain' solutions from the likes of Chainalysis, which are focused on enabling lengthy law enforcement investigations, and cannot be used by an exchange for large-scale anti-money laundering or sanctions compliance,” Robinson told CoinDesk in an e-mailed statement.  Chainalysis provides transaction monitoring for cross-chain exposure, a spokesperson for the analytics company told CoinDesk in an emailed statement.  ""Our unparalleled depth and breadth of data across multiple chains gives our customers the context and intelligence they need to manage risk. We’re always excited to see other players in the market adding this functionality as it only serves to further our collective noble mission,” the spokesperson said.  Elliptic had to build an “entirely new blockchain analytics engine,” called Nexus, over three years to make Holistic Screening possible, Robinson added.  Nexus enables Elliptic to trace the source or destination of funds through one asset within the same blockchain, through different assets within the same blockchain, as well as trace funds between assets across multiple blockchains.  “Fund flows are traced even when they 'hop' between chains – for example through cross-chain bridges. This tracing goes through thousands of hops if necessary,” Robinson said.

Bitcoin (BTC) jumped 2% and Ethereum (ETH) 7% in the minutes after the report, signaling relief on the part of crypto traders that the Federal Reserve might be able to relax its aggressive approach to tightening monetary conditions.  The consumer price index (CPI) surged 8.5% in July on a year-over-year basis, though it was unchanged from the previous month, partly thanks to lower energy prices, a report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed. The annual figure compared to an average estimate of 8.7% in a survey of economists by FactSet.  Stripping out food and energy prices because of their strong volatility, core CPI remained unchanged at 5.9% over the past 12 months, slightly missing expectations of 6.1%.

Ethereum (ETH) fell more than 5%.  “I think the market will continue to find confidence in the Fed staying on track with its proposed increases to the interest rates at the September meeting and we will continue to see our relief rally pick up steam in the crypto market,” said Howard Greenberg, cryptocurrency educator at Prosper Trading Academy.  Traders are now betting on a 65% chance that the Fed will hike interest rates by 50 basis points in September, compared with 32% just one day ago, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Recently, traders had been seeing a 75 basis-point hike as the likelier scenario after the jobs report last week showed that the economy is still in very good shape to sustain more rate hikes. Several central bankers have signaled that they will continue to tighten until they see inflation come down significantly.  ""The Fed will be cheered by the news, especially the fact that core inflation was also lower than expected,"" said Richard Carter, head of fixed-interest research at Quilter Cheviot, a U.K.-based investment management firm. ""They will still need to hike rates at their next meeting in September, but this reduces the risk of another 75 basis-point move and, going forward, we might just see markets act a little calmer than they have to date.”  UPDATE (Aug. 10, 2022 13:18 UTC): Adds chart from the CME FedWatchTool and additional information about the Fed's path forward.

Peter Kerstens, a technology and cybersecurity policy adviser at the EU’s executive arm, said the bill’s proposed compliance requirements would ensure stablecoin projects are more transparent and able to redeem customer assets upon request.  “We don’t want people to blow up the system or just go bust without any recourse, as we’ve seen for example recently with Terra-LUNA, which just melted away,” Kerstens said. “MiCA prevents such schemes from coming onto the market.”  The landmark legal framework, which hasn't been made into law yet, aims to provide regulatory clarity to the growing crypto industry in Europe. The legislation – which policymakers agreed to last month after nearly two years of debate – requires crypto issuers looking to do business in Europe to issue a white paper, register with authorities and in the case of stablecoins, have fully collateralized reserves.  Regulators around the world are wrestling with how best to oversee the crypto industry, a matter that has become more urgent as the industry has faced a spate of collapses, liquidations and bankruptcies.  In South Korea, the collapse of Terra has pushed regulators to speed up efforts to come up with their own comprehensive set of laws for that country’s crypto industry.  South Korean regulators have said that the coming Digital Asset Basic Act will take cues from their legal counterparts in the United States and Europe, including MiCA, “to improve global consistency” in crypto regulation.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/10/eu-official-says-europes-mica-bill-would-prevent-schemes-like-terra-from-happening,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7beffcd8c1d33fcef780ef55d02e9ac0a88c738b-4267x3200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The sum includes over $153 million in ransomware proceeds and crypto believed to have been stolen by North Korean hackers, the firm said.  Cross-chain bridges offer an unregulated alternative to using centralized platforms like crypto exchanges for transferring funds between blockchains, and are vulnerable to cyber attacks. Earlier this year, two separate attacks on the Ronin and Nomad bridges saw a total of around $825 million stolen by hackers. Another blockchain analytics firm, Chainalysis, estimates nearly $2 billion may have been stolen from attacks on cross-chain bridges just this year.  ""We believe that the use of RenBridge was part of the laundering process,"" Tom Robinson, co-founder and chief scientist at Elliptic, told CoinDesk in an emailed statement, adding that the obfuscation and layering achieved by passing the assets through RenBridge aided in concealing the illicit origin of the funds.  RenBridge facilitated the transfer of far more funds, but Elliptic said only $540 million of those transactions were crime related.  More than $2.4 million from the hack of the Nomad bridge in August has already been laundered with the help of RenBridge, according to Elliptic.

With over 320 million registered users, it’s one of the largest in Asia.  In the existing version, users interact through avatars, which they can personalize with virtual accessories. A marketplace called Zepeto Studio allows third parties – from small digital artists to global fashion brands like Gucci and Nike (NKE) – to sell customized virtual accessories. In the four years since Zepeto launched, participants have purchased 2.5 billion of them.  The ZepetoX’s 3D open world is intended to make it easier for users to monetize their ownership of NFT accessories, land and more. ZepetoX seeks to onboard crypto-curious Zepeto players to its platform, which will have a look and feel different to the Web 2 version.  “We believe that ZepetoX can build the ideal Web3 platform to not only bring blockchain to our existing users but also to expand our footprint in the blockchain space through various disruptive initiatives,” NaverZ CEO Daewook Kim said in a press statement.

42393795,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpB0Nr,1660130400,"Cloning Tornado Cash Would Be Easy, but Risky","What’s stopping anyone from redeploying the Tornado Cash contract on a new, non-sanctioned address? Technically nothing. But there are a slew of reasons – legal and technical – why it may not be in an individual’s best interest to challenge the will of the U.S. government.  On Monday, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) took the unprecedented step of sanctioning the popular cryptocurrency transaction anonymizer. All U.S. “persons” are thus barred from interacting with this smart contract, and could face the type of penalties usually reserved for terrorist financiers or mob bosses if not in compliance.  Already there have been attempts to thwart what some see as an overzealous attempt to rein in the crypto industry. A pseudonymous crypto user is sending small ETH payments from a Tornado Cash wallet to high-profile crypto holders, making them inadvertently interact with a sanctioned entity (because crypto transactions cannot be refused) in what’s called a “dust attack.”  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Industry think tank Coin Center, among others, is questioning the constitutionality of an outright ban of an open-source project. Members of the Tornado Cash Telegram channel are sharing advice on how to access the application through identity-protecting servers including the Brave and Tor browsers.  Others have noted that because Tornado Cash’s code is open source, and because Ethereum is a permissionless blockchain, it would be trivially easy to simply reconstruct the service. If you know how to copy and paste and know how to deploy a smart contract, you could be done by dinner.  There are many justifiable reasons someone would want to interact with Tornado, which until Monday was a legal and globally-accessible service. Ethereum, like many blockchains, makes transactions visible by default – meaning that anyone who would want to shield their financial history from employers, lovers or the world would have cause to “mix” their funds.  The U.S. government claims the platform was used to launder more than $7 billion worth of crypto since it launched in 2019. But analytics company Elliptic has only identified $1.5 billion worth of crypto filtered through Tornado tied to illicit acts like ransomware or hacks.  Moreover, the $7 billion figure the U.S. Treasury cited likely represents the total value of crypto sent through the vortex. (This is hardly scientific, but Etherscan creates word-clouds of names and labels associated with blockchain addresses and the one for Tornado Cash does say “phish/hack” but also “charity,” “maker vault owner” and something called “dragonereum tokenized asset” – which seems like a pretty neat visualization of a “general purpose technology.” You may not like everything about crypto, or understand it, but not all of it is nefarious.)  “If you were trying to disguise funds on Ethereum, now you have no real viable option,” Dublin University professor Paul Dylan-Ennis told CoinDesk. That sentiment was echoed by Gabagool.ETH, a prominent crypto degen and member of Info Token DAO.  “Tornado Cash was important not just because it worked (in theory) but because it was trusted, keys burned,” Gabagool told CoinDesk. Gabagool is referring to the destruction of the cryptographic keys needed to kick-start privacy-protecting applications, including messaging tools like PGP or blockchains like Monero.  This procedure, sometimes called “key shredding,” ensures that no one has access to the cryptographic keys needed to decrypt anonymized messages or transactions. Because it typically happens at the early stages of a project, sometimes before there are any users, you often simply have to have faith that this was done and that there are no “backdoors” for bypassing the encryption.  Shredding is so essential to the long-term viability of a project that it can take on a ceremonial aspect – like during the multi-day founding of privacy-oriented blockchain Zcash.  So, just because an alternate Tornado is running the same code doesn’t mean you can trust it. This would be all the more complicated considering there will likely be many Tornadoes that spring up, causing some market confusion.  Further, because Tornado Cash operated by tumbling transactions, the liquidity of the program had a direct bearing on whether it could successfully scramble the blockchain. If there were multiple Tornados, and no one could agree which was the “safe” one to use, they would all be less effective.  Or in Gabagool’s words, it’s likely people will redeploy the code, “but it’s not a true solve.” It’s also worth noting that because the project’s documentation was taken down from GitHub, the popular hosting service for open-source code, it would likely be difficult to retrieve.  Then there are the legal questions.  “It's really unclear what positions OFAC will take under their incredibly broad and vague authority,” Gabriel Shapiro, a prominent crypto lawyer, said in a direct message. “There is a reasonable argument that interacting with a new Tornado deployment is not covered by the sanction, but I wouldn't risk it,”  It seems likely that if you redeploy Tornado Cash you are taking on legal risk. And though the sanction document’s language is ambiguous regarding a possible redeployment, Coin Center’s Neeraj Agrawal said users probably would not be liable if they were to use an alternative Tornado.  “OFAC sanctioned a particular ‘service’ at particular addresses,” he said.

Validated takes  Ian and Dylan Macalinao faked a DeFi ecosystem, temporarily inflating Solana’s TVL during the bull run last year.  WHY IT MATTERS: Ian Macalinao, the chief architect of Solana stablecoin exchange Saber, created a web of interlocking decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols that projected billions of dollars of double-counted value onto the Saber ecosystem. “I devised a scheme to maximize Solana’s TVL: I would build protocols that stack on top of each other, such that a dollar could be counted several times,” Ian wrote in a never-published blog post unearthed by CoinDesk. By Ian’s own count, the protocols he built comprised $7.5 billion of Solana’s $10.5 billion TVL at its peak. Read more here.  Vitalik Buterin played down the impact of any hard forks after the network’s Merge in September, while Tron founder Justin Sun has been an active supporter of a hard fork.  WHY IT MATTERS: Prominent Chinese miners like Chandler Guo have proposed a hard fork, so even as Ethereum undergoes the Merge and becomes validated by stakers, miners could continue to support a newly separated PoW version of the chain. Buterin said, “I don’t expect Ethereum to really be significantly harmed by another fork.” Poloniex, a crypto exchange backed by Sun, has offered support for the Ethereum fork, currently called EthereumPOW.

BofA maintained its buy recommendation following release of the exchange’s second-quarter results.  The results warrant “a muted stock reaction,” the report said. Net revenue of $803 million was below the bank’s and consensus of anlyst estimates, while Coinbase adjusted $151 million loss before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization was better than the Street expected.  Importantly, the exchange remains “cautiously optimistic” it can reach its goal of no more than $500 million of adjusted EBITDA loss for the full year, the report added.  Coinbase shares fell almost 8% in premarket trading to $80.74.  Bank of America said Coinbase had no counterparty exposure to the crypto insolvencies witnessed in the second quarter. The company also has a “history of no credit losses from financing activities, holds customer assets 1:1, and any lending activity of customer crypto is at the discretion of the customer, with 100%+ collateral required.” These rigorous risk-management practices will be a “positive long-term differentiator” for the stock, the bank said.

Trading volume and revenue were down materially. Subscription revenue was also lower but would have been much worse were it not for higher interest rates, JPMorgan said in a research report Wednesday.  Coinbase is taking steps on expense management. In addition to reducing headcount inJune it is scaling back marketing and pausing some product investments, the note said.  The bank said Coinbase’s near-term outlook is “still grim,” noting the exchange expects a continued decline in third-quarter 2022 monthly transacting users (MTU) and trading volumes. Coinbase could take more “cost actions” if crypto prices fall further, according to the bank.  JPMorgan is less optimistic than Bank of America about the company in the near term, saying pressure on revenue from falling crypto markets will have a negative impact on the stock price. Still, it sees positives including higher interest rates, from which the firm will generate revenue. It also sees opportunities for the exchange to grow its user base, leveraging almost $6 billion of cash.

Will this retest result in a successful bullish reversal? Key Technical Points: The Theta Network price dropped by almost 10% in the last 36 hours, dropping to $1.50. The price drop increases the doubt about the bullish crossover of the 50 and 100-day SMA. With a market cap of $1.50 billion, the intraday trading volume of Theta Network has decreased by 89% over the last 24 hours to reach $82.47 million. Past Performance of THETA As warned in our previous analysis, the THETA prices reached the overhead resistance at $1.73, but the increased supply inflow resulted in a bearish turnaround. The overnight price drop of 5.95% in Theta Network prices resulted in a bearish engulfing candlestick and retests the psychological mark of $1.50. However, the retracement comes as the retest of the broken consolidation range teasing a potential bullish reversal. Source - Tradingview THETA Technical Analysis The THETA technical chart displays the daily candle forming a tail and avoiding a drop below the $1.47 horizontal level. Hence, traders hoping to ride a fallout should wait for a candle to close below $1.47. As the market price falls, the possibility of a bullish crossover between the 50 and 100-day SMA decreases due to the increased supply pressure.

The developers behind Blur Finance, a yield aggregator intended to leverage different decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and strategies to maximize user profits, appear to have suddenly abandoned the project and deleted its social media channels.  More than $600,000 worth of tokens vanished in the process, security firm PeckShield said on Wednesday. Blur ran on the BNB Chain and Polygon networks.  The protocol's website is returning an invalid certificate, and a link to its Discord channel results in an ""invite invalid"" message.  The move is a textbook rug pull, a scam carried out by developers who launch a working decentralized finance application and carry out social media marketing to popularize it before issuing a token and listing it on a decentralized exchange (DEX). After investors have purchased the tokens in the hopes of a positive return, the developers shut up shop and disappear.  The liquidity that investors provide can run into millions of dollars. Last week investors in Polygon-based Web3 game Dragoma appear to have been subject to a rug pull valued at $3.5 million. A Chainalysis report previously estimated that rug pulls totaled some $2.8 billion in 2021 alone.  Blur had over 754 holders on BNB Chain, trackers show. The project recently integrated with Polygon and provided annualized yields of some 4,000% as of last week. The contract was created July 7.

42394999,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASWhUI,1660109713,"At ETHSeoul, Ethereum Developers Turn Attention to Privacy and Users","SEOUL, South Korea — Ethereum developers turned their attention to privacy systems, scalability and enhanced user-friendliness as they gathered at a swanky building in Seoul’s Gangnam business district for ETHSeoul 2022, a technical conference focused on the second-largest blockchain.  White tees and gaming laptops were everywhere as enthusiasts cheered on Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who took the stage to kick-start the event that ran Aug. 5-7.  Buterin cited zero-knowledge (zk) proofs and Soulbound tokens as major developments within the Ethereum ecosystem that could provide better privacy, better security and real-world use cases for users.  “With zk proofs, you are able to prove you are a human without actually revealing it. You are also able to have reputation systems where you can prove you have done or did not do something,” he said.  “With Soulbound tokens, which are non-transferable, you can prevent dumping and unequal allocations, leading to better governance and fairer token distributions,” Buterin added, referring to the parts of the crypto world filled with opportunistic developers and rug pulls.  That was a view shared by Janmajaya Mall and Barry Whitehat from the privacy and scaling team for the Ethereum Foundation. Mall and Whitehat said the concept of off-chain microtransactions, or transfers of small tokens that are outside of a network, is a way to expand scalability for blockchain users while zk proofs improved the privacy aspect.  Nik Kunkel, developer at Ethereum lending and borrowing platform MakerDAO, summarized the problems and concerns brought about by the lack of transparency and actions of centralized institutions such as Celsius Network, BlockFi and Voyager Digital, and introduced the concept of community consortiums.  “Essentially you want to onboard everybody in the community and every stakeholder to get consensus,” Kunkel said. “You are essentially betting that the entire community isn’t going to murder itself.”  Rahat Chowdhury, an engineer at blockchain network Polygon, emphasized the importance of security and user experience for achieving mass adoption.  “People who are in the space understand gas fees and why we need them, but those who aren’t native to Web3 don’t get it and don’t want to,” Rahat said. “We need to make apps more inviting to people that aren’t native to Web3 if we are to achieve mass adoption.”  Michael Blank, COO of network developer Polygon Studios, spoke on the challenges of bringing Web3 to the masses.  “We need to ask ourselves what additional value the technology provides to the one before it, how easy it is to enter and engage users, and how many repeat users there are,” Blank said.  The Ethereum Foundation’s Aqeel Mohammad expressed the need for more proof-of-stake validator nodes to be established in South Korea and Asia to fulfill the aims of decentralization.

NFTs are here to stay, and with the current diminishing prices, it signals a good buying opportunity for investors. But with NFTs being a new technology, buyers and sellers are still facing difficulties because most platforms make it very hard to find the right NFTs. A company called LUDO is currently developing its own platform to simplify the user experience in the near future. Today, with no optimization or aggregation on marketplaces, organic exposure, SEO, or proper advertising, it is tough to find the right NFTs. But with the tools Ludo is developing for the space, they will change all of that. NFTs have become immensely popular in the last two years, recording a 200x surge in trading volume to reach $21.5 billion by late 2021. However, such growth has also led to a saturation in the market. The NFT space has become so massive and crowded that discovering promising projects is like finding a needle in a haystack. Leading NFT marketplaces like OpenSea and Rarible have successfully connected buyers and sellers, but, at the same time, their scope is mostly limited to front pages and promotions. This creates a gap, especially because existing NFT marketplaces are seldom creator-friendly. Most NFT marketplaces focus on high trading volumes above everything else, including customer turnover.
