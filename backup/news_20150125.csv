42398146,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbShET,1422227742,Coinbase Secures Approval to Launch Regulated US Bitcoin Exchange,"UPDATE (27th January 19:07 BST): An earlier version of this article stated that Coinbase Exchange had received regulatory approval in California. The California Department of Business Oversight has since released a statement denying that Coinbase Exchange received licensure.      Bitcoin services provider Coinbase is set to launch a US exchange on Monday – one reportedly already approved by regulators in 24 jurisdictions.  Coinbase  has until now acted largely as a brokerage for bitcoin users. By expanding into this new vertical the company will be able to ""offer greater security for individuals and institutions to trade bitcoin and monitor real-time pricing of the cryptocurrency"", the company told the Wall Street Journal.  “Our goal is to become the world’s largest exchange,” said Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong. He further explained that Coinbase ultimately plans to expand the exchange to users overseas, although it will be limited to the US for the time being.  Availability  Armstrong told CoinDesk the exchange will have a full order book and limit orders. A list of states whose residents have access to USD wallets and may use the exchange can be found here.  Coinbase hopes to have regulatory approval in all states in the next six months, he said.  The company will offer users two initial months of fee-free trades, and will take a 0.25% commission fee on all transactions thereafter.  Countdown to launch  The launch comes hot on the heels of Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss' announcement of their plans for a US exchange, called Gemini, which was also touted as the first to operate with full regulatory approval, but is not yet open to the public.  It also coincides with the launch of the Coinbase exchange teaser website – a webpage otherwise unmarked except for the title ""To The Moon!"", an animation of a rocket heading towards the moon and a clock counting down to Monday in centiseconds – that has incited speculation amongst the community about the forthcoming news.    T-minus 17 hours https://t.co/eB0on92NRJ      — Coinbase (@coinbase) January 25, 2015    The launch timing was not influenced by the Winklevoss' announcement, Armstrong said. Coinbase is launching the exchange simply because it is ready.  Coinbase now has $106m in VC funding behind it from investors including Andreessen Horowitz, the Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ) Growth Fund, Union Square Ventures, Ribbit Capital and, as of last week's announced series C funding round, BBVA, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Fortune 500 financial services group USAA and Japanese telcom giant DoCoMo.  Road to regulation  In the autumn, Coinbase expanded its services to 18 European markets in- and outside the eurozone and European Union, with varying degrees of bitcoin exchange limits.  It has since hired former Senate aide John Collins as an in-house liaison to US policy makers, a move that many industry observers deemed significant in maintaining and progressing the bitcoin dialogue in Washington.  The company began maintaining balances in USD with instant bitcoin purchases for customers in select US jurisdictions in December. Previously, US customers had to either wait days to acquire bitcoin or enable the 'instant buy' feature by linking a credit card to their accounts.  CoinDesk will continue to monitor this developing story.

42398162,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbShTE,1422202535,Cloud Mining Suffers as Hash Rate Plateaus,"The latest bitcoin price crash has started a new debate on the long-term viability of many aspects of the mining industry.  Notably, one of the first segments to take a hit in the days leading up to the crash was cloud mining – services that lease out hashing power from usually large-scale mining enterprises based in data centres.  On January 12th CEX.io announced it would suspend cloud mining activities due to low prices. In a blog posthttps://support.cex.io/hc/en-us/articles/204116146, the company said cloud mining is simply no longer profitable.  Number of bitcoin miners goes down  Over the weekend, Organ Ofcorti published a comprehensive analysis of weekly bitcoin network statistics.  The anonymous miner and blockchain data analyst pointed out that GHash.io reported a drop from 34,000 active user accounts to 6,000 user accounts on January 13th. The number then went down to 5,500 users. The drop was attributed to CEX.io’s decision to pull the plug on cloud mining operations.  As a result, the estimated number of bitcoin miners plummeted by almost 30,000 in a matter of days. However, this does not mean the hash rate went down. Following the crash, the hash rate recovered and returned to peak levels in less than a week, after hitting a low of 229,513,534 GH/s on 14th January.  Ofcorti shared his thoughts on the demise of CEX.io cloud mining with CoinDesk, concluding that the effect of the drop is negligible:  “I think cloud mining has had negligible effect on the network hash rate. Take for example GHash.io (the only cloud mining entity sufficiently transparent to prove this data) – their recent ceasing of cloud mining removed about 28,500 user accounts – but had almost no effect on their hash rate.”  Ofcorti went on to explain that cloud mining tends to appeal to those who could not afford to invest a lot in order to purchase and run miners.  “Further, there are just too few cloud mining block makers and making too few blocks. If they were having a significant on the network, they'd have a larger share of it,” said Ofcorti.  Digital currency consultant and entrepreneur Jonathan Levin described cloud mining as a good concept with some drawbacks:  “The cloud mining market seems like a good idea in theory ensuring that the ownership of the hashing power is distributed among many participants. However the market suffers from a lack of transparency and operational risk which currently the industry from pricing the contracts efficiently.”  Hash rate to plateau or decrease at current prices  While the hash rate recovered shortly after the crash, long-term projections are difficult to make at this point. Four months ago CoinDesk examined a number of problems facing the mining industry in the long run, concluding that growth rates at the time were unsustainable. Assumptions were based on substantially higher miner revenues and bitcoin prices.  Since then, things have taken a turn for the worse. Although difficulty and hash rate have continued to go up, the price of bitcoin has more than halved. The cost of ASIC development, tape-outs and manufacturing is bound to go up as chipmakers transition to new FinFET manufacturing nodes.  “Assuming no significant [order of magnitude] improvements in chip cost and efficiency, at the current price the hash rate will either plateau or decrease slowly. Most of the smaller players and those without low-cost electricity will leave the network once it's clear they won't recoup any losses,” said Ofcorti.  Ofcorti shares Levin's concerns about the possible centralisation of hash power:  “I think the main problem caused by the low BTC price is increased centralisation.”  While the question of centralisation looms over the industry, there are a number of influential industry leaders who consider the matter overblown. Gavin Andresen, the Bitcoin Foundation’s chief scientist, downplayed the risks at the annual Web Summit three months ago.  Andresen argued that centralisation is likely to occur in waves and therefore can be rolled back. He said economies of scale are currently forcing companies to create huge mining farms, but as mining ASICs become commoditised, the trend could reverse and the industry could decentralise again.  Mining companies remain bullish  However, a number of mining companies remain bullish and see a lot of potential in cloud mining. The pre-order business model is all but gone – as the market for individual and hobbyist sales dries up, cloud mining may be the only way for mining companies to move forward.  At the same time, some companies are exiting the cloud mining market, with CEX.io being the biggest player to pull out so far. Last week cloud mining service ZeroHash also announced that it may be forced to shut down its service due to unprofitability.  Hardware makers are feeling the pinch too. CoinTerra is the latest bitcoin mining hardware company to default. Earlier this year, the company found itself unable to service its debts and last week it was forced to default on roughly $4.25m of secured notes. CoinTerra CEO Ravi Iyengar said the industry downturn was unpredictable, both in terms of price and mining difficulty.  On the opposite side of the spectrum, some mining companies are still expanding, attracting investors and clients. They are not bucking the trend – they are simply doing what has to be done to maintain competitiveness at a time of crisis.

42398159,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbShSF,1422193531,How Anonymous is Bitcoin? A Backgrounder for Policymakers,"Adam Ludwin co-founded Chain.com, a bitcoin developer platform. Prior to Chain, Adam was a venture investor in companies including Vine, Slack, Kik, and Paperless Post. In this article, he addresses the distinction between privacy and anonymity in bitcoin.  Bitcoin is often described as a way to transact anonymously. But just how anonymous is it?  First off, it is useful to draw a basic distinction between anonymity and privacy in the context of financial transactions. We will call a transaction “anonymous” if no one knows who you are. We will call a transaction “private” if what you purchased, and for what amount, are unknown.  Let’s draw a simple matrix and locate different kinds of financial transactions within it:  Cash or barter are the most intrinsically private and anonymous means of transacting.  In the opposite corner are transactions which are neither anonymous nor private. This includes, say, campaign contributions over a certain amount. We may also include in this quadrant credit card transactions: although not public knowledge like a campaign contribution, your identity is nevertheless connected to every purchase you make, and this information is available to the merchant, credit card network, issuing bank, and — if subpoenaed — law enforcement.  Certain financial transactions are private but not anonymous; for example, the donor wall at the local art museum, which identifies the names of donors but not the amounts donated.  Bitcoin, by contrast, is anonymous but not private: identities are nowhere recorded in the bitcoin protocol itself, but every transaction performed with bitcoin is visible on the distributed electronic public ledger known as the block chain.  The anonymity provided by bitcoin is at once a point of attraction and a challenge for financial regulation. As the pace of adoption of the currency grows and as it comes under scrutiny by the legal and financial systems, particularly with regard to compliance with applicable anti-money laundering (AML) statutes and know-your-customer (KYC) controls, its true level of anonymity will become an increasingly closely studied subject.  For many users of bitcoin, who access the currency through one of the popular online wallet or exchange services, their participation at the outset entails linking their personal identity to their bitcoin holdings. Bitcoin for these users is effectively no more anonymous than a bank account, although this loss of anonymity takes place at the point of entry into the currency and is not a feature of the bitcoin protocol itself.  For those who wish to take advantage of bitcoin’s intrinsic anonymity, they must find an alternative entry point, such as acquiring bitcoin in a private transaction, as compensation for goods or services rendered, or as a reward for mining. Subsequent bitcoin transactions can then be anonymous, since real-world identities are not recorded on the block chain ledger: the only identifying information recorded there are the bitcoin addresses, whose corresponding private keys are held by the owners as proof of ownership.  Maintaining one’s anonymity from this point forward, however, is in no way guaranteed: even supposing one manages to acquire bitcoins without giving up personal information, one’s real-world identity can still be discovered in the course of transacting bitcoin within the network. Let’s look at how this can happen.  Broadly speaking, deanonymization techniques pursue one of two complementary approaches, having to do with the public nature of the transaction ledger and with the possibility of exposing the IP addresses of the computers originating the transactions.  Anonymity and the transaction ledger  There is no upper limit to the number of addresses a bitcoin holder can control. All one’s bitcoins can be stored in a single address, or they can be dispersed into dozens or even thousands of addresses. Meanwhile, good practice recommends (though does not enforce) that every address be used only once: any amount left over in change from a transaction should not be kept in the old address but moved to a new one. This proliferation of addresses designedly obscures which ones are controlled by a single individual at a single point in time, and makes it difficult to track the flow of funds controlled by that individual over time.  It is possible, however, to leverage the perfect transparency of the transaction ledger to reveal spending patterns in the block chain that allow bitcoin addresses to be bundled by user. This is the domain of transaction graph analysis.  Transaction graph analysis  Transaction graph analysis applies a few tricks and some educated guesswork to link the approximately 57 million transactions taking place between 62 million addresses to a subset of the unique holders of bitcoin. It then allows transactional relationships between these bitcoin holders to be mapped.  One basic technique in transaction graph analysis involves transactions with more than one input address. By definition these inputs are controlled by the same person — and if either address appears elsewhere in the block chain then the associated transactions can also be linked to the same person.  A second technique takes advantage of the “good practice” mentioned above: if exactly one of the output addresses in a transaction has never appeared in the block chain before, then it is a good bet that the new address is the change address.  A third technique looks at the numerical precision of the amounts involved in a transaction. For example, in a transaction generating two outputs corresponding to two new bitcoin addresses, where one of the outputs is, say, 3 BTC and the other is 2.12791 BTC, then it is a very good bet that the first number corresponds to the recipient and the second number to the change. What is the chance, after all, that the change should happen to end up in such a neat figure? The address originating the transaction can thus be linked to the change address with a high degree of confidence. The same analysis can be repeated after converting to major currencies such as USD to find “whole numbers” that might otherwise be hidden in bitcoin-denominated transactions and that enable sender to be distinguished from receiver.  Address deanonymization using these methods can be thwarted by sending bitcoins through so-called mixers or tumblers, which take a set of bitcoins and returns another set of the same value (minus a processing fee) with different addresses and transaction histories, thus effectively “laundering” the coins. But these services come with serious caveats. Users must hand over control of their bitcoins and trust the service to return them. Transaction graph analysis can identify use of a mixing service and flag the user as potentially suspicious. Mixers do not work well for very large sums, unless others with similarly large sums happen to be mixing their bitcoins at the same time. Some mixing services do not work as advertised and can be reverse-engineered. Services that operate legally must keep detailed records of how the coins were mixed, which could later be hacked or subpoenaed. And the new bitcoins received might themselves be tainted by illegal activity.  Seeding the transaction graph  Transaction graph analysis by itself only reveals the imprint of individual agency in the block chain; it does not reveal any real-world identities. For this it is necessary to refer to information not contained in the block chain.  A great deal of information linking bitcoin addresses to their identities is available publicly. Businesses accepting bitcoin may place a QR code near a cash register or on a website. Others may announce their bitcoin address through services such as blockchain.info, which identifies the owners of thousands of addresses. Thousands more addresses can be harvested from public email forums when individuals include personal bitcoin addresses in signature lines to posts. This partial knowledge of identities can be combined with the transaction graph to deanonymize a swath of the transaction ledger.  Retroactive geolocation is one potential consequence of this deanonymization. Suppose a café accepts bitcoin and uses a fixed address for their over-the-counter transactions. If you are a patron of that establishment, and your bitcoin addresses become associated with your identity, then someone can easily call forth from the block chain a partial record of your personal whereabouts over time.  Conversely, suppose someone wanted to link your identity to your bitcoin address, and you happen to mention that you visited the same café for lunch that day. Someone can look up the address used by the café, find the subset of transactions on that address taking place over the lunch hour, and filter the results by price to exclude transactions involving just a hot drink. Perhaps a bit more information on what you had for lunch, and a look at the café’s menu, and the chances of making a successful match are high.  Perfect knowledge of the transaction ledger also means that any additional information discovered at a later date can be retroactively applied, allowing further pieces of the identity puzzle to be dropped into place at any time. A single disclosure of identity, even years in the future, and every transaction on that address and those connected to it is compromised.  IP address anonymity  A complementary source of potentially deanonymizing information is available to every computer that participates in the decentralized transaction network by hosting a bitcoin node. This information is the set of IP addresses of the computers that announce new bitcoin transactions.  At the time of writing there are around 6,500 nodes accepting inbound connections from other nodes, and perhaps ten times that number which don’t accept requests for connections. The former maintain connections to several dozen peers on average, while the latter typically have eight peers. Both kinds of nodes generate transactions. Transaction propagation through the node network begins with the computer that first broadcasts the event to its peers, which then forward the event to their peers in an information cascade that usually reaches every node in the network within a few seconds.  The simple observation which can be exploited is that, provided one can find a way to connect to a majority of nodes, perhaps by controlling a coordinated sub-network of nodes spread over many devices, the very first node to relay a transaction is on average the originator of that transaction. The risk increases if multiple transactions are relayed from the same IP address. While a small random delay is baked into the transaction propagation protocol to help preserve the anonymity of the original sender, with the proper techniques enough signal is available through the noise to make a positive identification in many cases. And while use of a TOR router offers some measure of protection against IP address discovery, it exposes the user to other potential attacks.  An example of this kind of IP address deanonymization made public is blockchain.info, which discloses the IP address of the first node to report a transaction to its servers. The information is only as reliable as the web site’s node connectivity: with a declared 800–900 connected nodes at the time of writing, it is probably not enough to reliably pinpoint the originating IP in all cases.  So…  How anonymous is bitcoin today? Average users should be aware that it is certainly less anonymous than cash. Meanwhile, dedicated users willing to go through extraordinary lengths can find ways to acquire and use bitcoin anonymously, but the open nature of the transaction ledger and other unknowns leave open the possibility that identities and activities once considered perfectly secure may be revealed at some point down the road.  What about the future? As bitcoin adoption continues to increase, it is not out of the question that a technology arms race could arise between anonymizers and deanonymizers: on the one hand, increasingly sophisticated data mining schemes will be developed, possibly combining transaction graph analysis with IP address discovery, to trace the movement of funds in the block chain between individuals and across borders. On the other, improved techniques will be devised to better conceal individual identity and activity.  Here there are many unknowns. Will the core bitcoin code be modified to further protect anonymity or to facilitate regulation? Will bitcoin mixing services become pervasive and secure? Will transaction graph analysis reach a degree of sophistication where most user activities can be easily traced? Will an alternative digital currency or side chain arise which tilts the balance for or against anonymity? All we can say with certainty is that bitcoin is still in its infancy and that existing thinking and tools in the area of anonymity are still primitive. We have seen only the opening moves; the endgame has yet to be played.

42398147,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbShGR,1422184537,Searching for a Cryptocurrency Security Standard,"Bitstamp's recent hacking woes suggest that security in the bitcoin world seems to be getting worse, rather than better. Whether it's down to external attacks, or internal irregularities as alleged at Mt Gox, it's clear that something has to change.  When bitcoin wallet Blockchain experienced its own security problems in December, decentralised cryptography expert Emin Gün Sirer noted that the standard security practices among technology companies would not stand up in the bitcoin world.  Too much was at stake, he said. Social media companies may hold pictures of your pets, but your bitcoin account holds something more valuable. It seems reasonable that the cryptocurrency world should be held to a higher level of account than, say, Twitter (although a hacked Twitter account can still have pretty devastating results).  ""We certainly need better security practices, as we have seen from the constant stream of spectacular failures of bitcoin exchanges,"" he told CoinDesk more recently. ""These services have been failing at the rate of one major failure every two months, leaving many distraught people in their paths.""  So, if we accept that companies holding real live funds for customers should have higher security standards, what should those standards be?  Advice from bankers  If bitcoin companies shouldn't be looking to the general technology sector for their security, then they'll need to look elsewhere. Perhaps the banking industry might be able to offer some sage advice. Banks have been valiantly trying to stop hackers from pilfering their customers' data for years. Could bitcoin companies learn something from them? Given JP Morgan Chase's recent losses, maybe not.  The JP Morgan Chase hack was undeniably bad, but there's a key difference between that and a hacked bitcoin account. JP Morgan customers lost personal information, but not money. If a hacker targets your bitcoin account, your funds are gone.  Former digital forensics investigator Michael Perklin is president of the CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium (C4), which has developed a certification for cryptocurrency professionals. He argues that bitcoin companies must go beyond even banks in terms of security:  ""If someone breaks into a bank and someone edits their database to say 'Now I have a million dollars than I have before,' or they wire transfer funds out of the bank to go to another bank – then all of that is traceable and reversible.""  Conversely, he argued that on-blockchain bitcoin transactions aren't, as some exchanges and other bitcoin services have found to their cost.  ""With bitcoin, once you've taken the keys and transferred them someone else, there's no way to get them back without relying on traditional law enforcement,"" he warned.  If bitcoin companies can't look to Silicon Valley or to banks, then where can they look? Perhaps to themselves.  ""It's high time for the exchanges to realize that they are in this together, that a perception that bitcoin is insecure hurts the entire ecosystem, and it's in their best interest to establish practices (like the use of strong databases, multisig wallets, real-time proof of reserves, and trustworthy computing) for the entire industry,"" Sirer said.  Better software needed  One area where exchanges could improve is software development, argues Charles Hoskinson, cryptography expert and former CEO of Ethereum, who is now working on an educational project around cryptocurrency.  ""Exchanges need to clean up their acts and create a standards body for proof of solvency, along with smart contracts to regulate behaviour and restore trust, he said, adding that many exchanges are startups with limited resources. ""That's the other problem, which is that the software is pretty crummy.""  Building secure software is difficult. In 2003, Microsoft froze its entire development cycle for months, and effectively retrained its developers from the ground up to write more secure code. It began outlawing functions in different software libraries, forbidding its developers to use them.  Microsoft even designed a whole process, called the Security Development Lifecycle (SDL), to create software that was bulletproof (or, at the very least, contained fewer holes than the average lump of Gruyere).  Software development alone is not enough, however (and in Bitstamp's case, it isn't entirely clear where the vulnerability lay that allowed hackers to steal bitcoins from the company). There are other issues to consider, too, including infrastructure management. Elements such as change control and security patching are crucial for the operation of a secure environment.  Internal processes must also get better, experts say. Performing suitable background checks on personnel responsible for keys is one example, argued Perklin.  The good news is that some of these secure processes can be hard-wired into the technology used. Multi-signature technology is a good example. You may vet your senior executives responsible for accessing private keys, but having a system that requires several of them to authenticate a transaction would help to minimise, if not entirely eliminate, the risk of corruption and blackmail.  Taking care of business  If they don't get their heads around this, the danger for organisations holding peoples' cryptocurrencies is that they end up having someone else regulate it for them. Too many big thefts may draw interest from policymakers who may take matters into their own hands.  ""If there are enough customer complaints, regulators might just be compelled to step in with their usual heavy-handed approach,"" said Gun Sirer, adding that he hoped the industry pulls itself together before that happens. ""I'm in favour of getting the industry to clean up its own act.""  There's certainly enough money floating into the bitcoin community to pay for some grown-up programmers. CoinDesk's State of Bitcoin report in January documented venture capital investments in bitcoin reaching $433m, and $335m of that happened in 2014. That's a lot of salaries for technical security leads.
