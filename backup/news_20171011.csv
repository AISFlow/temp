The two enterprise blockchain heavyweights join a diverse group of organizations, including big corporates like Microsoft and Accenture, startups such as Civic and Gem, as well as open-source projects like uPort and Sovrin.  ""This should be a signal that there is broad agreement in this area that crosses some significant strategic [and] organizational boundaries,"" Daniel Buchner, the DIF's executive director, told CoinDesk by email.  While some of these firms compete with each other, they are nonetheless collaborating on this project in order to avoid building systems that function like disconnected silos – basically, the same as the legacy infrastructures they seek to replace.  ""[T]his diverse set of individuals and organizations is bound by a common creed: the belief that identity is composed of a deeply personal collection of data that defines us, and that your identity should answer to no one but you,"" the foundation said in a blog post published Wednesday.  To achieve such self-sovereignty requires ""the fundamental primitives, protocols, and tools necessary to create an interoperable ecosystem,"" the group said.

The four-page position note features two sections: one that largely reiterates a 2014 statement effectively banning banks and financial institutions from handling or otherwise working with cryptocurrencies, and another that hones in on the issue of ICOs. It comes on the heels of similar statements from other central banks regarding the legal ramifications of such offerings.  On the question of ICOs, or the sales of cryptographic tokens commonly used to bootstrap a new blockchain network, the central bank outlined a number of national laws that could apply – depending on the characteristics of the project and the function of the token itself.  Marius Jurgilas, one of the central bank's board members, said in a statement:  ""Notwithstanding the fact that such activities are not regulated, in their essence, they are the raising of funds from investors, often unprofessional, to finance some activity. Since the risk of losing investors' funds and other risks are particularly high, our position is that such offering, in certain cases, should be subject to investment related legislative requirements and restrictions.""  The central bank said that Lithuania's laws regarding securities, crowdfunding, collective investment schemes and the offering of financial services more broadly could impact the blockchain use case, per the text of the position note.  At the same time, the institution clarified that there is no specific piece of regulation regarding ICOs – a factor that both organizers and investors should bear in mind when moving ahead with any launch plans.  ""It should be noted that, when deciding on the application and scope of specific legislation of the Republic of Lithuania for specific ICO, the conditions of the relevant ICO should be analysed and assessed,"" the document states.

42427880,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4Xbh,1507744826,The Byzantium Countdown: What's Left Before Ethereum's Next Fork?,"The next major update to ethereum, the world's second largest blockchain by total value, is set to go live in less than a week.  Part of a larger, multi-component upgrade called Metropolis, the so-called ""Byzantium"" code will be enforced at block 4,370,000 – or in about four days according to current metrics – as a hard fork. A common (yet controversial) strategy for upgrading blockchains, this means the changes are required to be accepted broadly by all stakeholders on the ethereum blockchain.  In this light, however, it's notable that the use of this mechanism in the past has had mixed results for ethereum. To date, the platform has conducted four hard forks, with only one resulting in the creation of an alternative blockchain, ethereum classic.  Given the changes in Byzantium have been outlined in the ethereum roadmap as far back as 2015, it's unlikely it will prove problematic. With two major upgrades from Metropolis postponed, Byzantium is perhaps best seen as a conservative upgrade that will introduce nine key ethereum improvement protocols (EIPs) to the platform.  In total, the changes are designed to make the platform lighter and faster to run, improving transaction speed, smart contract security and eventually perhaps, privacy.  However, that said, there's still work to be done on the upgrade, with various stakeholders now entering the final stages of their preparations.  Clients  As the shift toward Byzantium is dependant on the network nodes updating, the main focus in the days ahead will be ensuring the clients that offer software to nodes are ready for the upgrade.  This means that startups responsible for overseeing clients need to ensure their software actually contains the EIPs that enforce the Byzantium hard fork. While each client enforces the same rules, they're written in different programming languages and backed by different developer teams.  This is what ethereum has called ""client diversity,"" which is intended to allow for innovation while retaining a stable, unambiguous base protocol.  In order for the upgrade to occur consistently across the platform, all ethereum clients must update with software that enforces the block number 4,370,000 (this doesn't impact third-party services such as online wallets, though, and is only relevant for people running nodes directly). The EIPs are coded into the clients alongside a block number, at which point the Byzantium hard fork will be triggered.  Within the next week, all major ethereum clients will need to release a Byzantium upgrade, with ample time for nodes to update. If certain nodes get left behind, the blockchain will split, creating different versions of the same platform.  However, at press time, most appear ready.  Go ethereum (also called Geth) is the most popular ethereum client, possessing roughly 69 percent of all ethereum nodes. Last week, it released a Byzantium-ready upgrade containing the block number, though, at the time of writing, only about half of the nodes that run Geth have been updated.  The second largest client, Parity, released a Byzantium-ready upgrade yesterday, but it was retracted after a consensus bug was found in a fuzz test (a kind of detailed fault analysis which involves filling a computer program with eclectic data until a weakness shows up).  A new upgrade is expected to be released later today. Of the approximately 35 percent of nodes that run on Parity, none of these have been updated to enforce the hard fork correctly.  The remaining node clients are comparatively small, and some have also released a Byzantium-ready release. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin's python-based ethereum client made available an update this morning. Similarly, java-based EthereumJ and java script EthereumJS released an upgrade earlier today.  The developers behind Cpp-ethereum say they are still working on the shift.  Miners  Those familiar with ethereum's roadmap likely know the protocol has long planned to phase out its proof-of-work consensus mechanism for a more experimental, and they argue, more egalitarian alternative called proof-of-stake.  That transition, however, will not be ready for Byzantium, though there are some upgrades designed to ease the eventual shift.  Most notably perhaps is that with Byzantium the mining difficulty will be significantly lowered. This means that ethereum transaction time will be faster, and miners will be paid less for their efforts. On ethereum, miners also run an ethereum client, and so will need to update for Byzantium accordingly, which will also introduce significant changes.  The update makes block mining faster, and in order to compensate for this, block rewards for miners after Byzantium will reduce by 2 ETH, or about $604 according to current metrics.  This upgrade has been largely supported, but it has been the cause of some dispute, leading some parties to threaten to continue to mine the pre-Byzantium ethereum. Unless these efforts turn out to be significant, though, this is unlikely to pose any impact on the exchanges.  Exchanges  If everything goes according to plan, these startups will be unaffected by the Byzantium fork.  Here, however, it's wise to note past complications. Ethereum's last major hard fork, an emergency measure in response to the failure of a major decentralized application called The DAO caused the sudden creation of two competing ether cryptocurrencies.  As a small group of users rejected the change, they were able to restart the old blockchain, forming a project now known as ethereum classic, valued at $11.48 according to current metrics.  As mentioned, there are a handful of signs that the Byzantium fork will be contentious, although none seem to be of particular significance.  A couple projects worth noting are those that intend to introduce new variations of ethereum, for example Etherite, which wants to create a version of Byzantium that does not lower the mining reward. If the movement gains support, this could put pressure on exchanges, which have shown a recent willingness to support assets running on so-called ""minority"" blockchains as a way to offer new alternatives for speculators.  Application developers  Applications running on ethereum are also unlikely to run into difficulties.  Mist, the ethereum browser for decentralized applications (dapps), automatically upgrades to Byzantium once it has been restarted. The same applies for all the dapps on ethereum.  Providing the hard fork occurs consistently across the nodes, the upgrades should activate instantly after block number 4,370,000.  However, there is one major change that will make a marked difference to how developers will interact with transactions on the ethereum blockchain.  After Byzantium, the way to detect failed transactions will change, even for contracts that are already deployed. The method for detecting a failed transaction after Byzantium is explained in more detail here.

According to an ASX announcement, iCandy had planned to develop the token – called ""NOX"" – itself, as a means to add functionality to a new gaming content marketplace. However, after a discussion with the ASX, during which iCandy's securities were suspended from quotation on the exchange, the firm said it has decided to no longer have any role in developing or managing either marketplace or token.  With the ASX potentially considering the activities a change of direction for the firm, iCandy indicated that those efforts will now be undertaken by a separate company, though it will remain the sole game content supplier.  Speaking to local media source StockHead, iCandy chairman Kin-Wai Lau said:  ""The discussion [with the ASX] was centered around whether by managing cryptocurrency, be it video-games related, iCandy has a change of its activities. We have since decided to focus on iCandy's key contribution to the Nitro project which is its ability to use its gamers and developers network to publish games funded by Nitro project.""  The firm will continue to fund the development of the marketplace. However, rather than profiting directly from the platform, iCandy will now receive a fixed amount of 3 million NOX per year for its role, equivalent to 3,750 ether (around $1.5 million).  Intended to democratise the video-game economy, the Nitro project had been planned as a mobile-based marketplace allowing users to vote on featured games, using NOX as an internal currency.  Marketplace users could vote on projects with the token, which would then be translated into ethereum's native cryptocurrency, ether, and passed on to game designers to fund development.

42427890,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4Xxh,1507737648,Nearing Bottom? Litecoin Prices Consolidating After Rough September,"Litecoin's price has had a hard time in the fallout of China's initial coin offering (ICO) ban.  While both bitcoin and litecoin took a hit after the early September statement from Chinese regulators – followed by domestic cryptocurrency exchanges voluntarily ceasing to offer services in the aftermath – bitcoin quickly recovered and neared record highs against the US dollar this week.  As litecoin support struggled, bitcoin seems to have benefitted from the rotation out of ether and ethereum-based tokens, triggered by fears of China-like ICO restrictions in other jurisdictions.  Against the U.S. dollar, litecoin is now down by more than $40 from its record high of $98.28, achieved on September 1. Further, the litecoin-bitcoin (LTC/BTC) exchange rate fell from 0.019 BTC (September 2 high) to 0.0098 BTC this week.  At press time, LTC/BTC is trading at 0.0105 BTC – down 0.9 percent on the day. Week-over-week, the pair is down 13.22 percent, while on a monthly basis, it is nursing a 34 percent loss.  However, price action analysis suggests that the LTC/BTC pair could be nearing a bottom.  4-hour chart  The 4-hour chart shows that:  The relative strength index (RSI) is rising from the oversold region.  The falling trend line is seen offering resistance at 0.0115 BTC.  Daily chart: RSI oversold  The weekly chart shows that:  Prices are currently hovering around the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level of 0.01025 BTC, which acted as a strong support mechanism in May, June and August.  Trading volumes have dropped significantly during the recent sell-off.  The upward sloping 50-day moving average is seen offering support at 0.0098 BTC.  View  The oversold conditions on the daily and 4-hour chart – which come at a time when prices are hovering around the critical 61.8% Fibonacci retracement support level – indicates the LTC/BTC pair could be nearing a bottom.  The dips below 0.01025 BTC (61.8% Fibonacci retracement) are likely to be short-lived.  The pair is more likely to rally to 0.012 and 0.0135 (200-day moving average) levels in the short run.

42427878,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4XZh,1507734027,Bitcoin-Ethereum Atomic Swap Code Now Open Source,"A team of cryptocurrency startup developers is open-sourcing technology that enables trustless trading between the bitcoin and ethereum blockchains.  Now available on GitHub, the code has already been used to execute what startup Altcoin Exchange claims is the first so-called ""atomic swap"" between the largest cryptocurrencies by market value. As a result of the release, a now larger community of developers can play around with and build on top of the code.  For example, using Altcoin Exchange's tech, developers can lock ether tokens in an ethereum smart contract that specifies the funds will only be sent if an equal amount of bitcoin is sent to a bitcoin address during a specific time window.  At a high level, that's how the developer team at Altcoin Exchange executed the trade (the ethereum code for the transfer can be viewed on the ethereum block explorer Etherscan), which shows how 0.12345 ether was traded for 0.12345 bitcoin.  But while that might seem experimental or complex, developers instead see the milestone as another step toward the tangible goal of replacing centralized cryptocurrency exchanges with the ability to swap assets directly between blockchains.  Long theorized, the idea of atomic swaps has been around since at least 2013, but it's seen a burst of new activity of late, with developers testing the technique to trade bitcoin for litecoin and bitcoin for zcash.  'Stepping stone'  Still, it's important to note the technology is in its early stages.  This means there are practical reasons atomic swaps might not be viable today, including the fact that one-to-one bitcoin-to-ether exchanges aren't exactly fair trades given the price disparity between the assets.  To this, Altcoin Exchange CEO Andrew Gazdecki told CoinDesk that the team set up the demonstration this way for ""testing purposes,"" though the likely next step will be to trade bitcoin to ether for their respective U.S. dollar amounts or another fiat currency equivalent.  Further, though Gazdecki believes this marks a ""milestone"" for atomic swaps, he admitted developers still have plenty of problems to iron out before this new type of trade sees everyday use.  As such, he framed today's release as a small step toward a better alternative, adding:  ""Decentralized trading is the next step forward in this industry.""

42427877,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4XTh,1507725019,Still Alive: NY Judge Delays Decision in Fight Against BitLicense,"""Is he paying you in bitcoins?""  The question directed by a court security guard to the legal counsel of New York resident Theo Chino yesterday, highlights a central issue long facing regulators considering the technology – is bitcoin a currency or commodity?  As the industry has found out, time and time again, that just depends.  But that answer isn't quite good enough in New York, where early rules were put in place for startups on the basis that money transmission laws applied. While most businesses have resigned themselves to the rules, getting practices in shape or else shipping out, Chino hasn't given up the fight.  Two years  after initially filing court documents, Chino's lawyer argued in court yesterday that the so-called BitLicense regulations brought an early end to his client's career as a bitcoin entrepreneur, as many others have claimed.  On one side, Chino's legal counsel argued that the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) overstepped its mandate when it issued the BitLicense. On the other, the defendant's lawyer argued that Chino had no grounds for his complaint.  But rather than dismissing the underdog claim, Judge Carmen Victoria St. George issued what may be one of the more surprising statements in bitcoin's short legal history.  She concluded:  ""Court reserves decision.""  Instead of formally weighing in on the case, Judge St. George set a future court date for the participants to reconvene on January 11, 2018.  But while that could seem like an irritating bureaucratic measure, Chino was all smiles at the day's conclusion. Not only does this mean his case gets to live another day, but the judge seemed, at times, swayed by his lawyer's arguments.  The plaintiff  For Chino and his legal counsel, the indecision can be seen as a small victory, one that will move their case ahead in court, and hopefully, provide relief for smaller businesses they argue have been hurt by the law.  Stepping back, the thrust of Chino's argument is and has been that as a ""small business"" owner, he did not have the resources to go through the notoriously expensive application process for the BitLicense. Not only does the application cost $5,000, but it has also resulted in applicants spending millions on legal fees.  So, back in 2015, Chino filed a complaint against NYDFS and ceased work on his business.  ""From the moment the license was promulgated,"" Chino's counsel Pierre Ciric argued in court, ""he knew the cost of compliance was prohibitive.""  And there's evidence to back up the claim. To date, just a handful of BitLicenses have been granted, and many more companies remain stuck in application status.  Still, it was perhaps Chino's critiques based on bitcoin's legal classification that had the most impact. When asked by the judge if bitcoin was, in fact, a financial instrument, Ciric responded, ""No, absolutely not.""  Instead, he argued the cryptocurrency was a commodity, more closely aligned with the definition put forth in 2015 by the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission.  And Judge St. George seemed open to the argument.  The defense  On the other side, however, Jonathan Conley, who represented NYDFS, spent much of his time sidestepping this larger intellectual question.  Rather than addressing bitcoin's open-ended legal definition, Conley argued instead that Chino had no right to proceed with his claim due to the fact that he botched his BitLicense application, among other claims.  According to Conley, Chino filed his forms with multiple fields stating ""not applicable"" and ""I will not disclose,"" before stopping the process altogether. Because of this Conley argued damages were only ""speculative.""  In this way, the remarks cut to the core of what could be another issue in the case – whether Chino is a suitable candidate to back his claims. But for now, that determination will be delayed.  Come January, it remains to be seen just how the judge will rule – and if more surprises are in store for what is perhaps the industry's most unlikely legal case.

The bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate clocked a fresh five-week high of $4,925 on Tuesday, but ended the session with marginal losses at $4,750.  The decline lacked clear catalysts, however. Techies may consider overbought conditions responsible for the retreat, while news traders may blame Putin's comments on cryptocurrency for stalling the rally at a time when record high was within touching distance.  But, whatever the reason, bitcoin's descend from $4,925 to $4,750 does call for caution. At press time, BTC is trading at $4,800 – up 0.20 percent on the day. Week-on-week and month-on-month, the cryptocurrency is up 14 percent.  Price action analysis suggests the broader outlook remains bullish unless prices end on a negative note today. In that event, a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change would be confirmed.  Daily chart  The chart above shows:  Doji-like candle signaling indecision in the market place  Average true range (ATR) continues to drop, indicating the uptrend lacks momentum or low volatility.  A doji candlestick forms when a cryptocurrency's open and close are virtually equal. It forms due to indecision between the buyers and sellers and signals exhaustion.  The average true range essentially tracks the range of price movement in the cryptocurrency. It is considered a volatility indicator due to the fact that it measures the distance between a series of past highs and lows for a given period. A higher ATR means the move (bullish/bearish) has strong momentum or the cryptocurrency is volatile.  The falling ATR on the bitcoin daily chart indicates weak momentum and a choppy market.  View  BTC could still test $5,000 as doji candles alone do not signal trend reversal.  Bearish Scenario: a negative price action today would confirm bearish doji reversal and open doors for a pullback to $4,500 levels.

42427884,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4Xfh,1507718706,Ethereum First: Investment Product Opens for Trading on Nasdaq Exchange,"A first-of-its-kind investment product focused on ethereum is now open to investors on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange.  Announced today, CoinShares, headed by former JPMorgan Chase trader Daniel Masters, is launching an exchange-traded note (ETN) for ether, the cryptocurrency that powers the ethereum blockchain. With the news, the ETN joins CoinShares's original bitcoin ETN offering, launched in 2015, in bringing a well-used mechanism from traditional markets to the world of cryptocurrency.  ETNs function similarly to exchange-traded funds, except rather than give investors access to a basket of assets, they generally give investors exposure to just a single asset.  In this way, more conservative investors wary about putting their money into funds that invest in multiple cryptocurrencies (some very new and yet to prove their use case), can invest now in only ether or bitcoin, the two cryptocurrency projects with the most market traction.  A principal at CoinShares, Masters framed the company's interest in ETNs as stemming from its belief that people should have ""hassle-free exposure"" to the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.  Masters told CoinDesk:  ""Bitcoin disrupts the functions of analog money and analog gold, and ether disrupts the function of the stock markets and the process of forming capital.""  The announcement is notable given that XBT Provider, which is wholly owned by CoinShares, currently holds a substantial cryptocurrency portfolio.  The firm recently announced a bitcoin position of 58,451 BTC — which, at current market prices, is worth over $250 million. (CoinDesk has seen a signed letter from CoinShare's Hong Kong-based custodian attesting to the size of their position.)  ETN details  As for what makes the product unique, Masters said the fund will differ from actively traded options in that it will be ""100 percent passive.""  Prices between the ETNs and the underlying coins will be about 99 percent correlated, Masters said, meaning that since the ETNs are based on a derivative product, the price of the notes and ether may not be the same at all times. Investors in the product can realize their profits (or losses) by selling their ether ETN in the open market.  Masters further added that his firm's ether-based ETN does not use any leverage. However, depending on which platform an investor uses to purchase the ETN, it may be possible to apply leverage through the investor's broker.  This option generally hasn't been available to investors purchasing ether and bitcoin on cryptocurrency exchanges, and shows the growing interest in the more sophisticated investment mechanisms that are prevalent with more traditional assets.  Only in Europe?  While the new ether-based ETN is being marketed exclusively to European investors for regulatory reasons, anyone with access through their brokers to NASDAQ Stockholm will be able to purchase the product from a technical, market access perspective.  Moreover, Masters told CoinDesk, that using a broker's platform to purchase the ETN may allow investors to hold exposure to ether in a retirement account, which may, under certain circumstances, result in a tax-advantaged tax treatment for the ETN in certain jurisdictions.

The president of Gary Shilling & Co, Inc and a frequent commentator on TV networks, Shilling told Business Insider he takes issue with the lack of clarity behind who invented the concept. Further, he related a recent conversation with a friend during which he asked about the pseudonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, comparing the answer he received with past financial scams.  He told the publication:  ""I'm just very suspicious of things that are not transparent. If I can't understand it, I don't want to invest in it.""  But while Shilling is the latest mainstream analyst to chime in on the cryptocurrency, he is certainly not the only one to voice suspicion about the idea. Earlier this summer, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called bitcoin a ""fraud"" and predicted its demise at the hand of regulation.  Other observers, however, have taken a more neutral tack.  Recently, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink – head of the world's biggest asset manager – said he was a ""big believer"" in the idea of cryptocurrencies, though he criticized the spate of speculation in the market.

In theory, the platform would link customers' fiat accounts at the three banks to the blockchain system. They would then be able to use the app to send money, as well as making deposits and withdrawals. On top of value transfer, the blockchain trial will also test clearing and settlement functionality.  Fujitsu explained in a press release that the pilot scheme will allow it to:  ""Evaluate the system's application of the series of processes involved in monetary transfers between individuals, including transferring funds from the money transfer account for individuals and the actual bank account linked with it.""  Fujitsu has already been working on developing the platform, and construction is set to continue for the next three months, the release indicates.

15990243,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/singapore-regulate-bitcoin-payments,1507687650,Singapore To Regulate Bitcoin Payments,"Singapore is working closely to regulate any Bitcoin payments. The minister for the nation’s central banking authority; the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), is working closely to create a regulatory framework for all Bitcoin payments. Despite Tharman Shanmugaratnam confirmed that the Monetary Authority of Singapore has been monitoring cryptocurrencies; it has no intention of actually regulating them, although certain peripheral activities will require a legal framework. However, they are now working to create a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency payment services, as a way to ensure that these are not misused for money laundering and terrorism financing. He went on to explain in a statement; “Virtual currencies can go beyond being a means of payment, and evolve into ‘second generation’ tokens representing benefits such as ownership in assets, like a share or bond certificate. These are financial activities that falls under MAS’ regulatory ambit”. Despite the fact that trading cryptocurrencies are very popular in the US, Japan and Hong Kong, the trading volume is actually fairly low in Singapore, which makes it easier to regulate the Bitcoin payments. Just like the trading volume, in other countries, many retailers are starting to accept Bitcoin; however, there are only about twenty different retailers in Singapore that accept Bitcoin. This research, according to the central banking authority, again, makes it easier for Singapore authorities to keep track, and regulate all of the Bitcoin payments.

15989280,http://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/singapore-regulate-bitcoin-payments,1507687650,Singapore To Regulate Bitcoin Payments,"Singapore is working closely to regulate any Bitcoin payments. The minister for the nation’s central banking authority; the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), is working closely to create a regulatory framework for all Bitcoin payments. Despite Tharman Shanmugaratnam confirmed that the Monetary Authority of Singapore has been monitoring cryptocurrencies; it has no intention of actually regulating them, although certain peripheral activities will require a legal framework. However, they are now working to create a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency payment services, as a way to ensure that these are not misused for money laundering and terrorism financing. He went on to explain in a statement; “Virtual currencies can go beyond being a means of payment, and evolve into ‘second generation’ tokens representing benefits such as ownership in assets, like a share or bond certificate. These are financial activities that falls under MAS’ regulatory ambit”. Despite the fact that trading cryptocurrencies are very popular in the US, Japan and Hong Kong, the trading volume is actually fairly low in Singapore, which makes it easier to regulate the Bitcoin payments. Just like the trading volume, in other countries, many retailers are starting to accept Bitcoin; however, there are only about twenty different retailers in Singapore that accept Bitcoin. This research, according to the central banking authority, again, makes it easier for Singapore authorities to keep track, and regulate all of the Bitcoin payments.
