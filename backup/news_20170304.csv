42379244,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82XRj,1488634209,Why You Won't See Bitcoin in a Casino Anytime Soon,"As evidenced by a Google search for 'bitcoin casino', bitcoins and gambling go together like two pedals on the same bike.  Bitcoin’s appeal as a cheap, efficient and low-key means of transmitting money has made it a hit among both online bettors and operators seeking reduced fees, lower chargeback risk and a way around legacy payment systems.  But as of now, these benefits mainly apply to online casinos operating in jurisdictions with little or no regulatory oversight.  While there has been some movement in Curacao, the UK and Malta recently, the use of cryptocurrencies in a legal and strongly-regulated gambling environment like the US still remains largely at the conceptual stage.  Because of heavy regulation and a desire among the gaming industry and its regulators to protect the industry's slowly improving public image, bitcoin appears to be years away from earning approval for use in either physical or online casinos in the US.  ""We have looked at digital currencies and do not find them appropriate for use in casino gaming at this time,"" AG Burnett, chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, told CoinDesk.  As Nevada is by far the country's largest gambling market, its regulators have an outsize influence on policymaking nationwide.  Burnett continued:  ""I think for us to consider allowing operators to use digital currency in gaming operations, there would have to be a high level of demand amongst operators, coupled with a clear demonstration of the safety and accountability that regulators could utilize in their duties.""  Asked why he maintains this position, Burnett stressed that the US dollar remains the backbone of Nevada's regulatory apparatus, and that any rethink of that must meet a high standard of merit.  ""Our regulations and statutes are all based on monetary units that are standard, such as the US dollar,"" he said. ""In fact, I think most of our regulatory foundation, from audit to enforcement and accounting standards, are all based upon normal US currency being used in a gaming operation.""  Burnett added that too much ambiguity surrounds bitcoin and its contemporaries, while questions of consumer demand still remain.  ""There are multiple types of digital currencies, whereas there is only one US dollar,"" he said.  Opportunity's knock  But none of this is to say that there isn’t enormous opportunity for the use of bitcoin in a legal and regulated gaming context.  ""It's a billion-dollar question,"" said Stu Hoegner, a cryptocurrency attorney with Gaming Counsel in Toronto. ""The potential is huge.""  For the land-based industry, bitcoin offers a potential remedy to casinos that are simultaneously seeking new ways of appealing to more tech-savvy young players, while reducing the amount of cash that shuffles around gaming floors.  Much like other industries, gaming is bending head-over-foot to attract millennial patrons to replenish its customer base. But younger players who grew up in the world of Xboxes and iPhones have a much higher threshold for being thrilled than do players in their 50s and 60s, many of whom are perfectly fine in front of a slot machine.  Slots remain the key revenue drivers for the industry, so figuring out how to replace or augment any declines is a critical task.  Opening doors  To this end, Burnett explained that the NGCB allows its licensees to operate bitcoin kiosks on their properties as long as the funds are used for non-gaming purposes.  At least two Las Vegas properties have embraced this opportunity. The D Las Vegas Casino and Hotel and the Golden Gate Casino and Hotel made a splash in early 2014 by announcing a move to accept bitcoin payments for hotel rooms, restaurants and other on-site vendors.  While this can be construed to some extent as a marketing gimmick, it is worth noting that Las Vegas has significantly diversified away from slot machines and table games towards hospitality and entertainment more broadly.  Non-gaming revenues now comprise roughly two-thirds of revenue generated at Las Vegas Strip properties, and this revenue stream is a core component to any property’s business model.  The other major issue facing casinos that digital currencies could potentially remedy is that they are heavily dependent on cash compared to other industries. Some experts estimate as much as 95% of casino floor transactions are conducted in cash.  This has become problematic in recent years as federal law enforcement agencies, led by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), have begun putting pressure on casinos – which offer banking-type services like lines of credit and are regulated under the Bank Secrecy Act – to tighten up their anti-money laundering efforts.  This has spawned a mini-wave of innovation within the space with regards to how payments are accepted, with companies like Sightline, Vantiv and others jostling for pole position in the race to rescue casinos from an overdependence on cash.  Looking abroad  At the 2016 Global Gaming Expo, the industry’s premier trade show in Las Vegas, one of the prevailing themes of the breakout sessions and vendor exhibits was the amount of work that remains to be done in this realm.  But the strict regulatory framework in which US casinos operate again comes into play. The industry claims that it is the most heavily-regulated industry in the world.  While casinos sometimes wear this as a badge of honor, the practical implication is that they often need regulatory approval for even the smallest of changes – such as moving a slot machine 10 feet on the gaming floor in some jurisdictions – with the end result being a throttling effect on outside-the-box innovation.  Sara Slane, senior vice president of public affairs at the American Gaming Association – the trade body that represents casinos – said that the industry is still probably five years behind where it would like to be with regards to non-cash payments.  Putting it all together, industry observers are confident that the US won’t be doing much trailblazing at the intersection of bitcoin and gambling in the coming years.  ""It could be another way they'll evolve with moving currency around,” said David G Schwartz, director of the Centre for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas.  He added:  ""I don’t really see casinos pushing the boundary on this.""  Others reckon that regulators in the US will likely take a follow-the-leader approach of their own and look for other countries to set the bar before deciding to dive in themselves.  ""The leadership of a place like the Isle of Man might be constructive. Maybe an outfit like Malta pushing it forward,"" he said, concluding:  ""I don’t think it’s going to be a regulator in the US that leads off.""

42379260,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82Xlr,1488632420,Long Live Dogecoin: Why Developers Won't Let the Joke Currency Die,"'Such crypto. Very currency. Wow.'  So went the enthusiastic, disjointed dialogue of the 'Doge', the cute Shiba Inu dog turned internet meme that was later adopted by cryptocurrency users in search of a less serious twist on the tech.  From 2013 to 2014, dogecoin carved its place in the crypto world, in part because its community used it more as a currency at a time when rivals bitcoin and litecoin were typically held as (serious) assets. At its height, hundreds or thousands of dogecoins would zip around Twitter and Reddit, sent back and forth between users who collectively dubbed themselves 'shibes'.  That momentum then expanded out into more serious endeavors, with the community raising money to fund a bobsled team and water wells in developing countries, among other charitable initiatives.  But as the cryptocurrency protocol closes on 18 months without an upgrade, is the fun-loving dogecoin finally dying? And what does dying even mean for a distributed software currency?  According to Jackson Palmer, the cryptocurrency's founder (who departed the community amidst growing acrimony in 2015), dogecoin has seen a broad decline on the development side – a state of affairs that doesn't bode well for its longevity.  Palmer, who continues to maintain his distance although he checks in on the parody currency every so often, told CoinDesk:  ""New features aren't being implemented into dogecoin because there's no active development anymore. Eventually, it will become outdated. And with that, the network will organically wind down.""  State of affairs  A look at the dogecoin GitHub page bears out this perspective to some degree.  According to data available, no changes have been made to the code since 20th October, 2015, and since a burst of activity in the middle of that year, contributions have essentially ceased.  Perhaps more telling is that trade volumes have also declined sharply since the cryptocurrency’s peak in popularity, according to CoinMarketCap.  The reason? People are moving on, said Palmer.  ""A lot of people that cut their teeth on dogecoin have moved on to bigger and better things,"" he said, adding that most of those people have migrated to platforms like ethereum.  On the other hand, the currency looks quite healthy compared to others, since new mining power continues to come online and dogecoin's hash rate keeps on climbing, according to data from BitInfoCharts.  Yet Max Keller, lead core developer of dogecoin, confesses that metric probably doesn’t hold much weight since the altcoin is merge mined with litecoin, meaning that litecoin’s hashing power provides security to the dogecoin network as well.  Keller suspects most new miners to dogecoin come in from litecoin (since dogecoin mining is not profitable anymore) – not only because the price of dogecoin has dropped, but also the mining reward for adding a new doge-block has fallen to 10,000 coins, or about $2 in US dollar terms.  And this low price point (dogecoin's all-time high price was around 200 satoshis, equal to about $0.002), is one of the reasons many cryptocurrency enthusiasts don't see it as being worthy of attention.  Yet the cryptocurrency continues to provide value to a group of people that together trade anywhere between $50,000 and more than $200,000 per day, data shows. And its three-person volunteer development team continues to keep tabs on the project, albeit when they have the spare time.  ""It's a DIY project for us, a hobby just to pick at every now and then,"" explained Ross Nicoll, a 37-year-old dogecoin developer.  In brighter news for the shibes, though, Nicoll told CoinDesk that he’s likely to take some time off from his day job as a software developer at blockchain consortium R3 to work on a dogecoin upgrade soon.  Keller too, hasn't given up on dogecoin, adding:  ""When you’re part of a community that large for over three years, you do get attached. Plus, you know how it works and if you can relatively easily apply that knowledge to an update, or providing something new to the community, why not do it?""  According to Keller, who’s also a mobile app developer for German Railroad, the only way he’d abandon his role as a dogecoin developer would be if everyone stopped using it.  'Zombie' currency  Therein lies the true question as to whether or not a cryptocurrency protocol – like other kinds of software – can experience a true kind of 'death'.  According to Nicoll, that’s no easy task. Even the old dogecoin client (current until a February 2014 fork) could still be used today if two nodes began running the client and were able to connect with one another.  With the right software, they could mine each other’s transactions, pocketing thousands of albeit valueless tokens.  Cryptocurrencies are ""a bit zombie-like"", Nicoll said. ""It's very, very hard to kill a cryptocurrency.""  Some might call a valueless cryptocurrency 'dead', but that would be missing any educational or entertainment value the token might provide. For instance, Nicoll said even after the 2014 fork, shibes were moving the old version of the coin around for about five or six months.  ""It was a functional currency, but you couldn’t use it at shops or on exchanges. We don’t know why they were doing it, but they were having a whale of a time,"" he said.  But how do you really kill it? The proverbial headshot for a 'zombie coin', according to Nicoll, would require removing the original code from GitHub, making it exceedingly hard to recreate it since very few people keep copies of source code material. Yet the nature of open-source software means that, in that rare instance, copies of the code could still be floating out there somewhere on the internet.  According to Gideon Greenspan, founder and CEO of Coin Sciences, there’s another way to inhibit these crypto zombies that would be just as detrimental as outright death.  ""When there’s a spiral of decreasing value and decreasing mining until [the cryptocurrency] becomes very insecure in terms of proof of work, at that point someone attacks the cryptocurrency with a 51% attack, possibly reversing a long period of seemingly confirmed transactions,"" Greenspan said.  At that point, he said:  ""The currency becomes completely discredited and worthless, since no one can transact in it with confidence.""  And even without being attacked, a coin can be discounted.  That, according to Greenspan, happened to mastercoin. When the price of the cryptocurrency began to drop, the developers stopped believing they were working on a project that would enrich them in the future, he said. As a result, they dumped their mastercoins, only worsening the effect, he said.  The result is more of an economic death, said Keller, rather than a technological one.  Long live dogecoin  As it stands today, dogecoin likely won’t see a technological death.  The current core devs are adamant about keeping the network running for the community – as long as there are people that want to learn about cryptocurrency via experimentation, or more serious users that still purchase digital goods and items on Steam, a marketplace for PC games.  Nicoll said an update for dogecoin will likely come very soon, since bitcoin has gone through two or three upgrades focusing on performance and user interface improvements since dogecoin was last updated in 2015.  ""That all tips an upgrade towards more reward than risk,"" said Nicoll.  One update that dogecoin is unlikely to integrate is Segregated Witness, a proposed scaling upgrade for the bitcoin network. The core team doesn’t see SegWit as potentially beneficial to dogecoin, which doesn’t have the same constraints as bitcoin, since its release rate is much faster.  As for the long period of inactivity on the development side, Keller pointed to the version 1.7 release of the altcoin, released in late 2014, by which the dev team sought to abandon legacy code in an effort to bring technological stability over a longer period of time.  While performance improvements will likely soon come through a soft fork, no major changes through a hard fork are planned without an impelling reason, such as a security threat.  ""There’s that saying, 'Never change a running machine',"" Keller said. ""That kinds applies here. If dogecoin is running well, and is well-tested, I don’t see many reasons to fiddle with it.""

42379250,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX82XaX,1488628231,A (Short) Guide to Blockchain Consensus Protocols,"We hear plenty of talk of how public blockchains are going to change the world, but to function on a global scale, a shared public ledger needs a functional, efficient and secure consensus algorithm.  A consensus algorithm, like bitcoin's proof of work (the one we hear about most often), does two things: it ensures that the next block in a blockchain is the one and only version of the truth, and it keeps powerful adversaries from derailing the system and successfully forking the chain.  In proof of work, miners compete to add the next block (a set of transactions) in the chain by racing to solve a extremely difficult cryptographic puzzle. The first to solve the puzzle, wins the lottery. As a reward for his or her efforts, the miner receives 12.5 newly minted bitcoins – and a small transaction fee.  Yet, although a masterpiece in its own right, bitcoin's proof of work isn't quite perfect.  Common criticisms include that it requires enormous amounts of computational energy, that it does not scale well (transaction confirmation takes about 10-60 minutes) and that the majority of mining is centralized in areas of the world where electricity is cheap.  Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto woke us up to the potential of the blockchain, but that doesn't mean we can't keep searching for faster, less centralized and more energy-efficient consensus algorithms to carry us into the future.  While not a comprehensive list, the following are a few of the alternative approaches being kicked around out there.  Proof of stake  The most common alternative to proof of work is proof of stake.  In this type of consensus algorithm, instead of investing in expensive computer equipment in a race to mine blocks, a 'validator' invests in the coins of the system.  Note the term validator. That's because no coin creation (mining) exists in proof of stake. Instead, all the coins exist from day one, and validators (also called stakeholders, because they hold a stake in the system) are paid strictly in transaction fees.  In proof of stake, your chance of being picked to create the next block depends on the fraction of coins in the system you own (or set aside for staking). A validator with 300 coins will be three times as likely to be chosen as someone with 100 coins.  Once a validator creates a block, that block still needs to be committed to the blockchain. Different proof-of-stake systems vary in how they handle this. In Tendermint, for example, every node in the system has to sign off on a block until a majority vote is reached, while in other systems, a random group of signers is chosen.  Now, we run into a problem. What is to discourage a validator from creating two blocks and claiming two sets of transaction fees? And what is to discourage a signer from signing both of those blocks? This has been called the 'nothing-at-stake' problem. A participant with nothing to lose has no reason not to behave badly.  In the burgeoning field of 'crypto-economics', blockchain engineers are exploring ways to tackle this and other problems. One answer is to require a validator to lock their currency in a type of virtual vault.  If the validator tries to double sign or fork the system, those coins are slashed.  Peercoin was the first coin to implement proof of stake, followed by blackcoin and NXT. Ethereum currently relies on proof of work, but is planning a move to proof of stake in early 2018.  Proof of activity  To avoid hyperinflation (what happens when too much of a currency floods the system) bitcoin will only ever produce 21m bitcoins. That means, at some point, the bitcoin block reward subsidy will end and bitcoin miners will only receive transaction fees.  Some have speculated this might cause security issues resulting from a 'tragedy of the commons', where people act in self-interest and spoil the system. So, proof of activity was created as an alternative incentive structure for bitcoin. Proof of activity is a hybrid approach that combines both proof of work and proof of stake.  In proof of activity, mining kicks off in a traditional proof-of-work fashion, with miners racing to solve a cryptographic puzzle. Depending on the implementation, blocks mined do not contain any transactions (they are more like templates), so the winning block will only contain a header and the miner's reward address.  At this point, the system switches to proof of stake. Based on information in the header, a random group of validators is chosen to sign the new block. The more coins in the system a validator owns, the more likely he or she is to be chosen. The template becomes a full-fledged block as soon as all of the validators sign it.  If some of the selected validators are not available to complete the block, then the next winning block is selected, a new group of validators is chosen, and so on, until a block receives the correct amount of signatures. Fees are split between the miner and the validators who signed off on the block.  Criticisms of proof of activity are the same as for both proof of work (too much energy is required to mine blocks) and proof of stake (there is nothing to deter a validator from double signing).  Decred is the only coin right now using a variation of proof of activity.  Proof of burn  With proof of burn, instead of pouring money into expensive computer equipment, you 'burn' coins by sending them to an address where they are irretrievable. By committing your coins to never-never land, you earn a lifetime privilege to mine on the system based on a random selection process.  Depending on how proof of burn is implemented, miners may burn the native currency or the currency of an alternative chain, like bitcoin. The more coins you burn, the better chance you have of being selected to mine the next block.  Over time, your stake in the system decays, so eventually you will want to burn more coins to increase your odds of being selected in the lottery. (This mimics bitcoin's mining process, where you have to continually invest in more modern computing equipment to maintain hashing power.)  While proof of burn is an interesting alternative to proof of work, the protocol still wastes resources needlessly. Another criticism is that mining power simply goes to those who are willing to burn more money.  The only coin that uses proof of burn is slimcoin, a cryptocurrency based on peercoin. It uses a combination of proof of work, proof of stake and proof of burn, but is only semi-active at this time.  Proof of capacity  As we’ve seen, most of these alternative protocols employ some type of pay-to-play scheme. Proof of capacity is no different, but here you 'pay' with hard drive space. The more hard drive space you have, the better your chance of mining the next block and earning the block reward.  Prior to mining in a proof-of-capacity system, the algorithm generates large data sets known as 'plots', which you store on your hard drive. The more plots you have, the better your chance of finding the next block in the chain.  By investing in terabytes of hard drive space, you buy yourself a better chance to create duplicate blocks and fork the system. But with proof of capacity, we still have the problem of nothing at stake to deter bad actors.  Variations of proof of capacity include proof of storage and proof of space. Burstcoin is the only cryptocurrency to use a form of proof of capacity.  Proof of elapsed time  Chipmaker Intel has come up with its own alternative consensus protocol called proof of elapsed time. This system works similarly to proof of work, but consumes far less electricity.  Further, instead of having participants solve a cryptographic puzzle, the algorithm uses a trusted execution environment (TEE) – such as SGX – to ensure blocks get produced in a random lottery fashion, but without the required work.  Intel’s approach is based on a guaranteed wait time provided through the TEE. According to Intel, the poof-of-elapsed-time algorithm scales to thousands of nodes and will run efficiently on any Intel processor that supports SGX.  The one problem with this protocol is it requires you to put your trust in Intel – and isn’t putting trust in third parties what we were trying to get away from with public blockchains?
