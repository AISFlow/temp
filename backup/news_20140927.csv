42397971,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEvIP,1411837585,China's Market Dominance Poses Questions About Global Bitcoin Trading Flows,"China's position as the most active bitcoin trading market has come to attention again as Beijing exchange OKCoin topped daily dollar trades for the first time earlier this week. This comes weeks after Shanghai exchange BTC China highlighted that yuan trades comprised more than 70% of trading volume.  As Chinese exchanges jostle for the top spot in global trading volumes, yuan trading is now three times greater than dollar trades. Analysts and exchange operators say China's dominance in bitcoin trading is largely due to macro factors like China's investment environment, but caution that current volume figures may mask an accurate picture of bitcoin trading flows.  Raffael Danielli, an economist who tracks digital currency trading at his Matlab Trading blog, took a macro view of China's dominance in the bitcoin markets:  ""It should not come as a surprise if we see more volume growth coming from Asia than from the West as it would simply reflect the existing disparity in economic growth.""  Trading volume data  Bitcoin trading volume was dominated by US dollar trading until the end of 2013. USD-BTC trades routinely accounted for more than 70% of traded volume, according to data from Bitcoinity.  Last October, dollar dominance began to slip, while yuan-bitcoin trades shot up. This came after the news that the US government had shut down the Silk Road black market, and as 2013 came to a close, CNY and USD trading took turns as market leaders.  By March, however, yuan trades began a decisive climb away from dollar trades, breaking the 70% mark of trading volume. Dollar trades plunged to under 25%, and the end of June saw the widest spread in the share of trading volume between yuan and dollar trades: the Chinese currency accounted for 79% of trades, while greenbacks comprised just 16% of the share.  Weekly trading volume data from Bitcoinity was used to look at trading volume trends and features over the last two years. Bitcoinity data was chosen because the three top Chinese exchanges were represented, along with the major exchanges outside China.  Kacper Cieśla, who runs Bitcoinity, says the data on his site is all self-reported by each exchange. There is a gap in OKCoin data for Nov 2013 to May 2014, which Cieśla attributes to a technical issue at the exchange (OKCoin confirmed that there was a halt in data collection by Bitcoinity for the period).  Macro factors and data accuracy  OKCoin's chief technology officer Changpeng Zhao echoed the macro theme brought up by Danielli, and noted that the range of assets available for retail investors in China is relatively limited, with tight controls on real estate, for example:  ""There is not much else one can invest in. This, combined with the increase in buying power – people naturally look to bitcoins.""  Arthur Hayes, who runs cryptocurrency derivatives exchange BitMEX in Hong Kong, agreed that Chinese trading volumes should outpace trading in the rest of the world, given the Chinese economy's growth.  Hayes cited China's larger population, restricted investment environment and more Internet-friendly banking system as specific reasons for greater bitcoin trading in that country, but he cautioned that the trading volume data may overstate China's dominance, because it's self-reported.  ""China definitely is number one, but quantifying its lead is debatable. But I don't doubt that China trades more bitcoin than any nation globally,"" he said.  Questions about the veracity of self-reported exchange volume data have dogged Chinese exchanges in the past. OKCoin's Zhao insisted that his exchange provided accurate data. BTC China founder Bobby Lee didn't respond to a request for comment.  Huobi's chief executive, Leon Li, suggested instead that users place a 100 BTC market-sell order on various exchanges to confirm market depth themselves – a suggestion that was also offered by BitMEX's Hayes.  ""That is an empirical method, which provides more useful information than self-reported exchange transaction volume,"" Li said.  Huobi and OKCoin now in the lead  As the share of yuan trading has grown, the amount of trades handled by Chinese exchanges has increased with it. The yuan share spiked last October, closely tracked by an increase in trading volume on BTC China. That exchange briefly held the largest share of trades, accounting for 48% of trades at its peak, from last October to December.  By contrast, the amount of trading activity on large exchanges outside China, like Bitstamp and BTC-e, has declined steadily since last autumn. Total trading volume has increased at a steady rate this year, after a growth spurt around the end of last October.  BTC China then lost its pole position to Huobi, which overtook the share of trades in mid December and continued to rocket to 67% of trades by January.  Huobi was surpassed by OKCoin this year, and Bitcoinity data shows that OKCoin emerged as the trading volume leader in late May.  OKCoin's own trading data shows that it completed trades worth just over 1m BTC in the last week of March, while Bitcoinity data shows Huobi trading volume for the corresponding period was 729,686 BTC.  Today, OKCoin trades take up about 30% of volume while Huobi accounts for around 20%. BTC China, however is climbing quickly, adding 10 basis points over September to take 18% of the volume pie.  Zero fees and wash trades  While macro factors may account for China's lead in bitcoin trading, specific details like fee structures on Chinese exchanges give a further boost to the amount of trades on Chinese exchanges.  Danielli pointed to OKCoin's margin-trading structure as one reason trading volumes have grown on that exchange. As users trade more, they accumulate 'reward points' that allow them to borrow more yuan for margin trading. CNY-BTC trading is free on OKCoin and Huobi.  ""People are 'trading with themselves' to increase volume and get to [the desired points level],"" Danielli said.  The sort of trading described by Danielli is illegal in US equities and commodities markets, where it's known as 'wash trading'. In these transactions, a security doesn't technically change hands, and is effectively being traded by one party who takes both sides of the deal.  Such trades are outlawed because they distort market information about a security and can mislead other investors, according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Hayes, formerly an equity derivatives trader at Citi, said the zero-fees structure used by Chinese exchanges means that the chances of wash trading on those platforms are high:  ""Wash trading is a very big deal in traditional finance, but in bitcoin-land, I could just say I traded $1tn in bitcoin derivatives yesterday, but if you're stupid enough to believe me, then go ahead.""  Tim Swanson, who has written books on business in China and works for Hong Kong-based altcoin exchange Melotic, pointed out that even with possibly-inflated yuan trading volumes, dollar trades may actually be far greater, but aren't represented in the data because they're traded over-the-counter.  Swanson noted that miners and US-based 'universal' bitcoin firms like BitPay or Coinbase could be processing thousands of coins daily with counterparties with large fiat and bitcoin holdings, but are never traded on an exchange.  ""The OTC and off-chain liquidity inventory is not being factored into most of the overall discussion on trade volume. The aggregate volumes of OTC or 'dark inventory' numbers may actually be larger in US dollars than [yuan],"" he said.  Impact on wider bitcoin economy  Even if trading volume on Chinese exchanges is inflated by wash trades, it's unclear how the exchanges stand to gain from occupying the top spot in global trading volumes, since they don't earn any revenue from the activity.  Swanson thinks pumped up trading volumes could simply be used to build a user-base that would then pay for revenue-generating products. Huobi, for example, has launched a fixed-term certificate of deposit that requires a minimum deposit of 1 BTC.  ""[Chinese exchanges] are busily trying to answer that question with a variety of value-added services like margin trading and issuing derivative products as well as integrating with API services,"" he said.  China maintains strict controls on foreign exchange, although the government is said to be loosening these restrictions gradually. Current rules mean companies and individuals can only move small amounts of funds in and out of the country.  For Hayes, China's currency controls and the large amount of genuine trading taking place mean the bitcoin markets are divided into those that can tap Chinese markets and those that can't.  Institutional investors in financial centres like New York or London already face regulatory obstacles to accessing Chinese equity markets, for example. As a result, Chinese markets are walled off, and their dominance may have little impact on traders outside the country.  Hayes said:    ""China might have 70% of the volume, but institutional investors will not trade Bitcoin onshore in China [...] The market is bifurcated. As a non-Chinese person, you can't interact with the Chinese banking system. Yuan is still a restricted currency. It means a global investment firm has to trade bitcoin-dollar, because they're in New York or London.""              Update (28th Sept, 10:10 GMT): An earlier version of this article stated that Huobi CEO Leon Li had declined to comment on the veracity of his exchange's volume data. Li had actually stated it was competitors' data he did not wish to comment on, and he stood by his own company's statistics.

42426080,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiRvh,1411829678,Planning the Perfect Bitcoin-Only Vacation,"The convenience of having a truly borderless currency can’t be overstated.  Similar to how the Internet broke down barriers for global communication and made information more accessible to everyone, bitcoin has the potential to change international travel in a significant way.  Anyone who has felt ripped off by a foreign currency exchange company, had their credit card abruptly cancelled or has dealt with a lost or stolen wallet while traveling abroad can attest to the benefits of using a completely digital, non-fiat currency for international travel.  For these reasons, the travel industry has been particularly receptive to digital currencies. A number of airlines now accept bitcoin, Expedia has made booking hotels with bitcoin easier than ever and the number of merchants accepting the digital currency continues to rise.  All of this has made planning a bitcoin-only vacation much less daunting than even just a year ago.  With this in mind, below are four carefully-curated vacations that may appeal to bitcoiners with an itch to travel. For the most part, the expenses for each trip can be paid entirely with bitcoin, and of course there are many other options beyond those listed when planning the perfect bitcoin vacation.  Live lavishly in New York City  How to get there: Use CheapAir to book a flight into any major NYC airport (JFK, La Guardia, Newark). Ridesharing company Uber processes payments with Braintree – which recently announced a bitcoin partnership with Coinbase ­– so getting around the city with bitcoin may become much easier in the near future.  Where to stay: There are countless hotels to choose from on Expedia, but for those seeking the most extravagant NYC experience, go ahead and book a suite at the iconic Waldorf Astoria – it will set you back about $529 per night, or around $1.3 BTC per night at press time.  What to do: New York is famous for its eclectic cuisine, and many restaurants and cafes in the city accept bitcoin. For free entertainment, explore Central Park or just walk around and marvel in the concrete jungle of skyscrapers.  Explore the beauty of Bali  How to get there: A full service travel agency – BitcoinTour ­– will make planning your Indonesian getaway a breeze. The company helps customers book their flight, hotel and train reservations all with bitcoin, so you can start relaxing before your trip even begins.  Where to stay: Thanks to the BitIslands initiative, Bali is quickly becoming a 'bitcoin paradise' for travelers near and far. BitcoinTour claims to work with “almost all” three-star hotels in Indonesia, so you won’t have to sacrifice comfort for convenience when paying with bitcoin.  What to do: Bali is known for being one of the most beautiful places in the world, so for starters, soak up the natural beauty! Once you’ve gotten your fill of the many beaches, there are plenty of options for dining and shopping with bitcoin, and the island even has a 'bitcoin center' where you can learn more about the digital currency.  Backpack through Europe on a budget  How to get there: CheapAir saves the day again, as the bitcoin-accepting flight company operates in many European cities. Options for ground travel through Europe are limited when paying with bitcoin, but Spanish bus line Destinia accepts bitcoin and operates in many popular European cities like Amsterdam (pictured above), Barcelona, Florence and London, to name a few.  Where to stay: For bitcoiners on a budget, peer-to-peer apartment sharing company 9flats will be a lifesaver when traveling through Europe. While not as widely recognized as its competitor Airbnb, 9flats certainly wins points with the bitcoin community for accepting the digital currency for user bookings and reservations.  What to do: The number of things to do, places to explore and sights to see in Europe is truly astounding. The challenge, then, is finding activities that can be paid for with bitcoin. For this, CoinMap is an invaluable resource for researching the many different places that accept bitcoin throughout the continent.  Kick back and relax at Island Villas Jamaica  How to get there: Book your flight to the Kingston Airport using CheapAir. The airport is about 100km from where Island Villas Jamaica is located in Port Antonio, so unless you can work out arrangements directly with management, you may have to shell out some fiat to get to your villa.  Where to stay: Island Villas Jamaica manages 30 private villa properties in the northeastern Jamaican city of Port Antonio, so you'll be certain to find a luxury villa to suit your needs. The vacation rental firm is particularly welcoming to the crypto community – it also accepts litecoin and dogecoin for booking accomodations.  What to do: There's something in the Carribbean air that just helps ease away any stress that can build up from everyday life. Relaxing should be a top priority when you're at Island Villas Jamaica, but in case you want to venture out, the world famous Blue Lagoon is just a short trip away.  Wherever you decide to go, you can rest assured that traveling with bitcoin can help add convenience and flexibility to your itinerary – just remember to pack your passport.

42426095,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIiS1h,1411822522,12 Ways to Measure the Bitcoin Network's Health,"The ultra-resilient bitcoin network is the world's largest distributing computing project in terms of raw computational power, having long ago surpassed 1 exaFLOPS (1,000 petaFLOPS) – over eight times the combined speed of the top 500 supercomputers.  Although since increasing to an amazing 3.2 zettaFLOPS (3,200 exaFLOPS), the project was quietly removed from Wikipedia's list of distributed computing projects. This is probably due to the fact that the exaFLOPS estimate breaks down with bitcoin's specialized ASICs, since they are not capable of floating-point operations.  Instead, the estimate may be used for estimating how well other supercomputers and distributed networking projects would be able to mine bitcoin, since supercomputers have the capability to perform the integer operations used in hashing.  Therefore, today's fastest supercomputer, China's Tianhe-2 with a performance of 33.86 Pflop/s, would measure at about 0.001% of the bitcoin network.  Monitoring network health  As bitcoin matures and starts to compete with legacy retail payments networks like Visa and MasterCard, and wholesale networks like Swift, the health of the decentralized network becomes vital to its performance capabilities.  Community site Bitcoin.org does an excellent job of maintaining the historical archive of network status alerts and vulnerabilities.  The assembled report below lists the critical statistics for monitoring the ongoing health of the distributed bitcoin network, covering the measurements important for reachability, scalability, security and transaction processing speed.  1. The Bitnodes Project  Bitnodes estimates the size of the bitcoin network by finding all the reachable nodes in the network. The current methodology involves sending getaddr message recursively to find all the reachable nodes in the network starting from a set of seed nodes. It performs this polling every 24 hours and displays the results on a world heat map of countries, including rankings and version of bitcoin reference client.  The Bitnodes Project launched in April 2013 with the Bitcoin Foundation’s sponsorship as a community resource. The project's latest report can be seen herehttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/09/bitnodes-project-2014-q3-report-the-state-of-bitcoin-p2p-network/.  2. Data Propagation  The information exchange in the bitcoin network is all but instantaneous. Exactly how fast is information being propagated in the network though? Maintained by BitcoinStats, the propagation evolution chart shows the 50th percentile of the inv-messages received by peers (ie: the plot shows the time since a transaction or block enters the network until a majority of nodes has received and processed it).  3. DNS Bootstrap Servers  DNS seeds are used by almost all bitcoin clients to identify a set of nodes to connect to when starting. The seeds are run by volunteers using a multitude of mechanisms to ensure the returned seeds represent a good sample of nodes currently online.  Except for bitseed.xf2.org, the seeds aim to return nodes that are currently online and reachable. Also provided by BitcoinStats, the chart shows results from regular bootstrap attempts using the seeds with the plot representing the average hourly connection success rate for each of the seeds. The closer to 100%, the better the seed is.  An auxiliary chart with response time of DNS seeds to queries is also provided, which indicates the response times in milliseconds (ms) elapsed between sending the query and receiving a response.  4. Network Hashing Rate  Provided by developer Pieter Wuille, this series of graphs display hashing difficulty and the estimated number of terahashes per second (computation speed) that the network is performing for various time windows (1 terahash equals 1,000 gigahashes).  Calculated by dividing maximum target by current target where target is a 256-bit number, difficulty measures how difficult it is to find a new block compared to the easiest it can ever be. Difficulty adjusts every 2,016 blocks (or two weeks) and to find a block, the SHA-256 hash of a block’s header must be lower than or equal to the current target for the block to be accepted by the network.  5. Hash Rate Distribution  This pie chart from Organ Ofcorti is an estimation of hash rate distribution amongst the largest mining pools at a weekly interval. It is important to monitor because the integrity of the network depends on a single actor not exceeding 50% of the overall hashing power.  A table of solved block statistics lists all statistics that can be derived from the number of blocks a hash rate contributor has solved for the past week. Block attributions are either from primary sources such as those claimed by a particular pool website, or secondary sources such as coinbase signatures, or known generation addresses.  When dependent on secondary sources only, data may be inaccurate and miss some blocks if a particular block-solver has gone to some trouble to hide solved blocks and this will result in an underestimate of the block-solver hash rate.  An alternate chart across 24-hour, 48-hour and four-day time horizons is provided by Blockchain.  6. Selfish Mining Indicator  Produced by Coinometrics, this metric attempts to measure the likelihood and prevalence of bitcoin miners engaged in a subset behavior of the 'Selfish Mining' strategy, as described by Ittay Eyal and Emin Gün Sirer in their paper, Majority is not Enough: Bitcoin Mining is Vulnerable.  Since the bitcoin protocol relies on miners following the rules laid out by the software, as soon as miners have found a block they need to announce it to the network.  Selfish mining defies this rule, because certain miners, once they have found a block, can withhold it from the network and start working on their next block. Once they have a number in their hidden chain, they can release them to invalidate the blocks that the network thought were part of the main chain.  The lower the probability that at least k (actual distribution) blocks will be found in the time represented by the first bucket, the more likely that miners are engaging in quick succession behavior under the Selfish Mining strategy.  Coinometrics explains:  ""One way to estimate the likelihood of such a strategy being implemented is to measure the distribution of the time between blocks against the expected distribution. The rate of creation of bitcoin blocks is determined by how quickly the first miner solves for a hash meeting the difficulty requirements of the protocol. Every attempt to meet this difficulty has a set probability of being correct. By definition, the probability is independent between hashes. As a result the rate at which blocks are generated should follow an exponential distribution.""  7. Orphaned Blocks  Orphaned blocks are valid blocks which are not part of the main bitcoin block chain. They can occur naturally when two miners produce blocks at similar times or they can be caused by an attacker with enough hashing power attempting to reverse transactions.  Initially accepted by the majority of the network, orphaned blocks are those that are rejected after proof of a longer block chain is received that doesn't include that particular block. In other words, a user could see a transaction as having one confirmation and then revert to zero confirmations if a longer blockchain was received that didn't include the transaction.  8. Double Spends Monitor  Blockchain maintains a real-time monitor for double spends detected in the last 500,000 transactions utilizing a 10-minute cache. This could be used to alert users to potentially malicious transactions on the network.  9. Unconfirmed Transactions  Blockchain also maintains this live updating list of new bitcoin transactions waiting to be included in a block. The monitor displays total number of unconfirmed transactions, including total fees and total size in kilobytes.  10. Average Transaction Confirmation Time  This measures the average (mean) amount of time in minutes that it takes for a transaction to be accepted into a block. Reasonable estimates differ on the amount of time and confirmations for a transaction to be considered cleared and ‘good’, but that appropriate risk level would be associated with the transaction’s value.  11. Block Chain Total Size  The block chain total size is important because of the storage space considerations as it grows as well as the time it takes for initial synchronization after installing the reference client for the first time. This measurement shows total size of all block headers and transactions not including database indexes.  12. Average Block Size  Measured here in fractions of a megabyte, the block size will become a heated debate once the bitcoin network starts approaching its current throughput limit of approximately seven transactions per second.  Ultimately important for scalability, the stated block size limit will have to be increased, linked to another variable, or remain the same with more confirmations pushed off chain, each path having corresponding implications for decentralization of the system.  Please let us know in the comments section below if we have omitted any measurement critical to network operations or if any references are out-dated.
