28062462,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608786,1716069629,"This Crypto Trader Just Sold All His Bitcoin For Altcoins Like Cardano And XRP, Here’s Why","Crypto expert Michaël van de Poppe recently revealed that he had sold all his Bitcoin and rotated his capital to altcoins. The analyst explained the reason for this move and remarked that he was doing this to acquire more of the flagship crypto later on. Why This Analyst Swapped His Bitcoin For Altcoins In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Van de Poppe explained that altcoins have been “crushed unreasonably hard.” As such, he believes things can only improve from here on, noting that the “upside (for these altcoins) can’t be denied.” Related Reading: Crypto Analysts Reveal Sub-$1 Altcoins Set To Outperform In The Bull Run Based on his explanation, the analyst suggested that these altcoins will likely outperform Bitcoin from here on as the flagship crypto already had its moment before the halving when crypto natives swapped their altcoins for Bitcoin. Before now, Van de Poppe had already predicted that altcoins would make a bounce in their Bitcoin pairs post-halving. He also mentioned back then that there would be a narrative shift to Ethereum. More recently, he indicated that the news around the Spot Ethereum ETF would trigger a rally for Ethereum and other altcoins. While explaining his decision to swap his Bitcoins, he again touched on this and hinted that Ethereum would be integral to any move these altcoins make. Van de Poppe claimed everyone expects the worst, that the Spot Ethereum ETF applications will be denied because the SEC considers the crypto token a security. Therefore, he believes the market is already priced in accordingly and can only recover from here on, even if the SEC eventually rejects the applications. The crypto analyst further claimed that the markets could make a “significant U-turn” if the news ends up being slightly better than a rejection. He also highlighted other developments that could help trigger this move. One is the FIT21 bill, which the House will soon vote on. This bill is expected to provide regulatory clarity for digital assets in the United States. Van de Poppe also noted that the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple is coming to a “final stage” and predicts that the crypto firm will likely secure a final victory, which could also help provide a major boost for these altcoins. Meanwhile, he expects that Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) and Real World Assets (RWA) will be “massive,” with traditional companies transitioning into the Web3 ecosystem. As such, Van de Poppe urged his followers to “allocate” themselves if they wanted to “make a large return.” Van De Poppe’s Big Bet It is worth noting that Van de Poppe’s decision to swap his Bitcoins for altcoins isn’t an end in itself but a means to an end. The crypto expert hopes to make a return of 300% to 900% on his investment in the coming six to twelve months. Van de Poppe hinted that he would rotate his capital back to Bitcoin after this period and predicted that he could make another 300% to 600% return on his investment as long as Bitcoin stabilizes. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Willy Woo Predicts Bitcoin Has Room To Run – Here Are The Drivers He warned of the risk of taking such a bet, revealing that he is currently down around 20% on his overall investment. He also remarked that he could still post more losses on his investment, considering these altcoins could still experience further declines from their current price levels. However, Van de Poppe added that he is fine with whatever the outcome of his investment is. Again, he reaffirmed that he is “happily allocating” his entire capital towards altcoins and concluded by stating that the bull cycle will be “glorious.” Chart from Tradingview.com",POSITIVE,없음,ADA | ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/crypto-trader-bitcoin-altcoins/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

28054571,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608774,1716058835,Floki Inu Frenzy: Memecoin Eyes New Highs As Open Interest Soars,"Floki Inu (FLOKI), the Shiba Inu-inspired memecoin, has rocketed into the spotlight with a surge in trading activity and a nearly 20% price increase in the past week. However, experts caution that this “pup-ularity” might be short-lived, fueled more by hype than by strong foundations. Related Reading: Crypto Alert: VeChain Bull Run Imminent, Expert Predicts 500% Rally Open Interest Takes Off: Newcomers Flock To FLOKI The key indicator driving excitement is the skyrocketing Futures Open Interest for FLOKI. According to Coinglass, this figure, which reflects the number of outstanding futures contracts, has climbed a staggering 110% since May 1st, reaching a 30-day high of nearly $20 million. This suggests a surge of new market participants entering FLOKI positions, potentially anticipating further price increases. Adding fuel to the fire is the significant rise in FLOKI’s daily trading volume. On May 15th, Santiment reported a daily volume exceeding $1 billion, marking the highest level for FLOKI since late March. This intense buying activity indicates a surge in investor interest, pushing the price upwards. Momentum Indicators Point To A Bullish Charge Further bolstering the case for a bullish FLOKI is the behavior of its key momentum indicators. Both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Money Flow Index (MFI) currently sit comfortably above their neutral lines, at 62.68 and 65.37 respectively. In simpler terms, these metrics suggest that the price momentum leans towards further gains in the short term. Also, the broader market sentiment surrounding FLOKI is notably positive. Increased trading volumes and a surge in social media mentions have amplified investor interest, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is gaining traction not just among retail traders but also institutional investors. Recent partnerships and strategic developments within the FLOKI ecosystem are likely to fuel further growth. These factors, combined with the strong technical indicators, paint a promising picture for FLOKI’s near-term performance, potentially paving the way for substantial price appreciation. However, beneath the shiny exterior lies a potential cause for concern. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), an indicator that measures the buying and selling pressure of an asset, paints a rather bearish picture. Still In Negative Zone Despite the price appreciation, FLOKI’s CMF remains firmly in negative territory, currently hovering around -0.11. This suggests that even though the price is rising, the buying pressure might be weakening. This divergence between price and buying pressure is often seen as a sign of a potential reversal, indicating a rally driven by short-term speculation rather than long-term investor confidence. Related Reading: ADA Price Surge Could Push Ratio Of Holders In Loss Below 55% While FLOKI’s recent performance is undeniably impressive, the underlying factors suggest a potentially volatile future. The surge in open interest and trading volume hints at a market frenzy, but the negative CMF raises concerns about the rally’s sustainability.

If so, this will be massive for ADA, which could experience significant price surges soon enough based on this development. Related Reading: Solana On The Brink? Price Stalemate At Crucial $140 Support Cardano Whales Add To Their Holdings The market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock recently revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Cardano whales (who hold between 100 million and 1 billion ADA) have now added 11% to their balances over the past 30 days. These investors now hold 6.71% of Cardano’s total supply. This represents a bullish development for Cardano since whale accumulation usually suggests that these investors are positioning for a potential price surge. These whales also contribute to the price surge since buys of such magnitude could trigger a rally in the price of any crypto token. Besides the whales, retail investors are also heavily invested in Cardano. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that the bid-ask volume imbalance is bullish for ADA. Furthermore, the ‘In The Money’ metric has also turned bullish for Cardano, meaning that most of these investors are currently in profit. Generally, the confidence in the Cardano ecosystem is growing once again. Data from DeFiLlama shows that the Total Value Locked (TVL) on the network has increased by over 5% in the last seven days. Lately, there has also been a significant increase in Cardano’s trading volume, meaning users are actively trading on the network. Cardano’s Rally Is Imminent Crypto analyst World of Charts suggested that Cardano might soon experience a significant rally, noting that the crypto token’s breakout was already confirmed and moving toward the projected price targets. The analyst had previously predicted that a successful breakout would take Cardano’s price to $1 in the coming weeks. Crypto analyst Trend Rider also confirmed that Cardano is already witnessing a bullish reversal, highlighting the bounce the crypto token made after flashing a bullish signal on the daily chart. In the short term, the analyst expects ADA to climb back above $0.5 and added that Cardano will need to hold above $0.51 on the weekly to end the price correction and confirm a bullish continuation. Related Reading: Whale Watch: Ethereum Fresh Buy Signal Sparks Speculation Crypto analyst Dan Gambardello, the founder of Crypto Capital Venture, also provided insights into Cardano’s future trajectory. He noted that Cardano is currently breaking its 20-day moving average (MA), which the analyst claimed is a very “nice sign” for ADA. Gambardello pointed out on Cardano’s daily chart that the 50-day MA has crossed the 200-day MA, which likely means that the bottom is already in, and this is the lowest Cardano will go.

This can be seen in the below image. 4-Hour RSI: The formation of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in the above image also suggests that the price of AGIX is bullish as the RSI signal line is seen trending above the 50% level. This indicates that buyers are active in the market therefore overpowering the strength of sellers. Alligator Indicator on the 4-hour timeframe: A look at the alligator indicator from the 4-hour time frame shows that the price is trading above the alligator lines as the alligator lip and teeth have both successfully crossed above the alligator jaw, suggesting that the price might continue to move in an upward direction. Support And Resistance Levels To Break Conclusively, the price of AGIX is currently trading around the $0.99038 resistance level and if it manages to break above this level, AGIX’s price will continue to move further toward the $1.04237 resistance level and if it breaks above this level, an upward trend might begin. However, should the price of AGIX fail to break these resistance levels, it will reverse and start a downward movement toward its previous support level of $0.82620. If it manages to break below this support level, the price might move further to test the $0.75779 support level.

AI computing demand competes with Bitcoin mining, with some miners diversifying their income through AI projects. Mt. Gox potentially distributing $9.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, which could impact the market if it aligns with a bearish climate. I've been arguing that the Bitcoin ETF launches, like the iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), as well as the halving event (which recently happened) were a big deal for Bitcoin. That's not immediately evident if we look at the price action post halving. Data by YCharts Previously, see Bitcoin ETF Approval What Does It Mean For Crypto Stocks, I wrote that I wasn't too sure where BItcoin was headed in the short-term. At the time, it was still below $50k. But I expected the selling post the launches of the Bitcoin ETF's to be short lived. One major reason being the halving event that would quickly become the next thing in focus. Now it may appear like the market anticipated the halving and drove prices up ahead of time. Meanwhile, the event itself is a dud. Although the halving is a discrete event it shouldn't be viewed like an ""event"" similar to a corporate take-over or a dramatic election outcome like we've recently seen in Argentina. Instead, the halving limits the rewards that go to miners which drives up their costs and leads to a decrease of supply of Bitcoin over time. However, Bitcoin sales by miners are just one factor in the supply and demand dynamic. Sentiment among retail and institutional traders can easily dwarf the change on this front. When Bitcoin rose sharply at the end of 2023 and at the start of 2024 this lead to miners raising quite a bit of fresh capital and investing in new mining equipment. They did so to attempt to maintain revenue post-halving but this also mitigated some of the supply loss due to the halving. I like to think of the halving as raising the floor on the Bitcoin price and lifting the ceiling. I'm still not certain where the price will go but if people continue to view Bitcoin as an interesting asset its trading range has likely moved up. Coinshares published an interesting report on the break-even prices for miners post-halving and they estimate it went from $29.5k per Bitcoin to $53k per Bitcoin. Bitcoin mining rewards (Coinshares) One thing that really stood out to me from the report is that AI computing demand seems to compete quite directly with Bitcoin mining: Our recent mining company management discussions reveal a notable shift, with some miners increasingly turning to AI at their energy-secure sites. Although this trend is relatively new, companies like Hve and Hut 8 report 3.6% and 2.9% of their revenues from AI, respectively, with others also developing AI projects. We are witnessing a growing preference for AI over Bitcoin mining in these energy-secure locations. Looking ahead, it is conceivable that Bitcoin mining could become predominantly based at energy-insecure stranded energy sites, especially where it can subsidise such energy projects financially. Conversely, miners seeking revenue diversification and potentially higher margins are likely to invest in AI, exacerbating this divergence. I'm skeptical of the share prices that most publicly traded miners trade at. When there is a willingness to ""diversify"" income by performing AI compute that makes me even more skeptical. It may be solid business to run data centers but it's not generally a business that trades at astounding multiples of earnings, free cash flow or book value. However, the urgency with which companies and governments invest in AI and AI capacity is real. Just this week a bipartisan group of U.S. senators has been calling for a $32 billion increase in government funding into AI. This isn't immediately relevant to the Bitcoin price right now. It does suggest the demand for datacenter locations and hardware is likely to remain high meaning it won't be as easy for miners to bring on capacity as it could otherwise have been. Meanwhile, Crypto research firm K33 Research has argued Tuesday report that Mt. Gox, may be distributing up to $9.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. Potentially, as early as this month. This has been a known bearish argument for a while as the payouts were delayed multiple times. It could definitely make an impact if distributions line-up awkwardly with a bearish crypto climate. Otherwise, it could easily be a non-event. The Bitcoin market cap is well over a trillion. To put it in some perspective; Apple's market cap is $2.91 trillion and it just launched a $110 billion buyback program. Meanwhile, flows into the crypto ETFs look to be picking up and I think these will be quite important in driving Bitcoin's valuation in the near term. Bitcoin ETF flows (Coinglass) The most important consideration whether to invest in IBIT is whether Bitcoin exposure is desirable or not. After all this is a one asset ETF. I've compared the major U.S. based Bitcoin ETF's when they were launched see; How To Choose Between The Bitcoin ETFs . It is often argued, and I tend to agree, holding Bitcoin through self-custody is the best option. However, this introduces quite a bit of execution risk as the stories of people having lost access to their Bitcoin or got their wallet hacked are myriad. A potential advantage is that you never lose value if there is some kind of signficant hard fork (which is how Bitcoin Cash came to be), airdrop, switch to a proof of stake (like Ethereum) type of transaction verification model. The latter seems particularly unlikely. Currently, this value loss isn't a hugely signficant issue given haven custody taken care of is worth something as well. Yet, down the line it is possible that the vulnerabilities the ETFs create become expoited and there will be a tracking error (besides fees) between Bitcoin and the ETFs. The fees aren't too bad though as IBIT charges 0.25% per year. It is still more than a broad-based equity ETF (arguably a more complicated product) but it is a far cry from the previous generation of products that often charged 2% or more. Blackrock, IBIT's sponsor, actually lowered the fees over the first $5 bilion for the first year to 0.16%. Currently there's already $18 billion in the fund and we're halfway through the year so that discount isn't as attractive anymore. If someone wants to get Bitcoin exposure through a U.S. based ETF IBIT is one of the best options because of liquidity, modest fees, and having the premier asset management firm put its reputation on the line. In conclusion, while the market's response to the recent Bitcoin halving didn't result in an immediate explosive price movement upwards as some expected, it is a significant milestone. It is likely to have raised the trading range of the asset. Miners start breaking even just below $60k now. When the price dips below that, or it trades close to that level, it doesn't make a lot of sense to invest in mining capacity. Meanwhile, the computing equipment ages quite quickly. This doesn't determine value but it does have an impact on supply. Demand for Bitcoin can fluctuate in surprising ways but there are no similary large changes on that front. That's why I continue to believe the halving is an event that's a positive for Bitcoin, and the potential upside far outweighs the downside.",POSITIVE,없음,BCH | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4694311-ibit-ishares-bitcoin-trust-why-the-halving-may-still-impact-prices-going-forward?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/28042657.jpeg

28038398,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608684,1716037233,Why Did Bitcoin Just Jump 10%? Blockchain Firm Weighs In,"The cryptocurrency market has been on a hot streak in the past few days, with several large-cap assets posting significant gains in the past week. Most notably, the Bitcoin price bounced back from around $61,000 to above $67,000 for the first time in nearly a month. As expected, this latest price movement has sparked a lot of speculation and discussion around the premier cryptocurrency. Popular blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant has shared on-chain insights into the recent Bitcoin price rally and its future trajectory. How Did Bitcoin Price Reach $67,000? In a recent report, CryptoQuant revealed the catalyst and on-chain manifestations behind BTC’s latest rally to above $67,000. According to the analytics firm, the price of Bitcoin rode to its new highs on the back of the news of lower-than-expected inflation in the United States. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin About to Take Off? Indicators Suggest Upward Momentum Ahead The inflation data released on Wednesday, May 15 showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.3% in April – lower than the expected 0.4%. This revelation suggested that inflation might be on a downward slope in the US, making risky assets like Bitcoin more attractive. In its report, CryptoQuant revealed that there has been a decreased selling pressure in the BTC market, as short-term holders are selling at low or negative profits. Meanwhile, Bitcoin balances at over-the-counter (OTC) desks have steadied, implying that fewer coins are entering the open market. What’s more, the analytics platform highlighted a particular on-chain signal that might have predicted the recent Bitcoin price rally. According to CryptoQuant, BTC miners have been extremely underpaid over the past few weeks, which often correlates with price bottoms. The Catalysts For Sustained BTC Rally? CryptoQuant, in its report, identified potential catalysts for a continued rally for the Bitcoin price. According to the on-chain data company, demand from permanent holders and largest investors is on the rise but it needs to climb rapidly to push the price of BTC even higher. Related Reading: Solana Takes The Crown: CoinGecko Ranks It The Best, Leaving Ethereum Behind In Key Metric Furthermore, the latest data shows that Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded funds) purchases have dwindled to nearly zero daily, while stablecoin liquidity growth is also on a decline. CryptoQuant noted that these two metrics need a jolt, which might be critical for a sustained Bitcoin rally. As of this writing, the Bitcoin price continues to hover around $67,000, reflecting a 2.5% increase in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the premier cryptocurrency is up by a significant 10% in the past week.

This positive price performance by the maiden cryptocurrency has been attributed to the low inflation levels reported in the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. However, Bitcoin is an asset subject to the influence of several forces. According to a report by blockchain analysis platform LookonChain, BTC may soon experience another price rally following an increase in the supply of a specific stablecoin. Related Reading: Unstoppable Bitcoin? CryptoQuant’s CEO Foresees Bull Run Extending To 2025 Can USDT Replicate Surging Effect On Bitcoin? In an X post on Friday, LookonChain reported that the Tether Treasury has minted an additional 1 billion USDT indicating a consistent rising demand for the stablecoin. USDT which ranks as the third largest cryptocurrency doubles as the most dominant stablecoin in the crypto space with a market cap value of $111.25 billion. The USDT token has famously recorded much growth in the last year with over 31 billion new tokens minted on the Tron and Ethereum network. Interestingly, LookonChain reveals that this rise in USDT market share contributed significantly to Bitcoin’s ascent from $27,000 to $73,000 in the past fifteen months. The theory behind this relationship stems from an increase in traders’ liquidity provided by investments in USDT. This increased market liquidity can alter the status of Bitcoin’s supply and demand and oftentimes lead to a rise in BTC’s price. Following the most recent 1 billion USDT minted by the Tether Treasury, most investors and spectators could be expecting a similar boosting effect on Bitcoin’s price, especially with the crypto bull season in play. However, Bitcoin’s price in the coming months is still likely to be influenced by other factors such as the BTC spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) market. According to data from SoSoValue, net inflows on Friday reached $177.01 million bringing the total value of the Bitcoin spot ETF market to $12.58 billion. As more major traditional finance players gain a piece of this novel market, Bitcoin is expected to experience monumental levels of demand which will translate into weighty price gains.

The crypto market leader is currently in a consolidation state as it gathers momentum to break past the 67,000 resistance zone.

In a surprising move, ADA has instead become the top performer among major coins, experiencing a 7% surge in the last 24 hours. This price action has ignited discussions about ADA’s potential to revisit its 2021 glory days, when it reached a peak of $3.10. Related Reading: Whale Watch: Ethereum Fresh Buy Signal Sparks Speculation A Tale Of Two Whales: Retail Accumulation Vs. Profit Taking The recent price increase can be attributed to two key factors: a surge in buying pressure and a potential upcoming “battle of the whales.” On-chain data reveals that retail investors, the so-called “whaley” masses, have been accumulating ADA aggressively, particularly between $0.48 and $0.50. This large cluster of buyers could act as a support system if the price reaches that level. However, lurking beneath the bullish sentiment is a potential obstacle. Data shows that only 40% of current ADA holders are in profit. A price increase to $0.49 could be particularly significant, as it could push the ratio of holders in loss below 55%. This milestone could trigger further buying pressure as more investors see an opportunity to move into profit territory. Whales Return? On Volume And Market Cycle Cardano’s price rally is also being fueled by a significant rise in trading volume, reaching a weekly high of $461 million according to Santiment. This surge in activity indicates growing interest in ADA, which could propel the price further upwards. But can this momentum be sustained? The answer might lie with the “original whales,” the large investors who hold a significant portion of the cryptocurrency. Interestingly, the current distribution of ADA shares some similarities with the market conditions in 2021, when the price hit $3. Back then, whales held roughly 6% of the total supply. Today, that number sits at nearly 7%, suggesting a potential return of these big players. However, analysts caution that the success of this “whale comeback” narrative depends heavily on the broader market cycle. If the current bull market reaches its peak, ADA’s price growth could be restricted, hindering its ability to revisit its all-time high. Can ADA Defy The Odds? Cardano’s recent price surge has instilled a sense of cautious optimism in the cryptocurrency community. While the strong buying pressure from retail investors and the potential return of whales are positive signs, the profitability of current holders and the unpredictable nature of the market cycle pose challenges. Related Reading: Filecoin On Fire: Analyst Torches Doubters With $15 Target In the coming weeks, it will be crucial to observe whether ADA can overcome the selling pressure at $0.49 and sustain its upward trajectory.

He made this claim based on an indicator that suggests crypto investors are still willing to buy the flagship crypto at higher prices. Related Reading: Filecoin On Fire: Analyst Torches Doubters With $15 Target Bitcoin Still Has “A Lot Of Room To Run” Woo mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin still has a lot of room to run before the flagship crypto experiences a reversal or consolidation. To support his bullish sentiment, he shared a chart highlighting Bitcoin VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price). The crypto analyst further suggested that bulls were firmly in control, stating that he would hate to be a “trapped Bitcoin bear right now.” The VWAP measures the average price of Bitcoin over a specific period and factors in the volume at each price level to determine the current sentiment in the market. The chart Woo shared showed that Bitcoin’s VWAP was currently on an upward trajectory. In a subsequent X post, Woo highlighted Bitcoin’s risk signal to further reinforce his bullish sentiment. He noted that Bitcoin is still in the early stages in its liquidity cycle and is still doing “warm-up exercises.” He added that Bitcoin’s long-term frame risk signal is relatively low as it is still consolidating under all-time highs. He claimed that this risk “only starts climbing after the floodgates open,” meaning that the best is yet to come for Bitcoin. Meanwhile, the wave of profit-taking by Bitcoin investors (since the crypto hit a new all-time high in March) looks to be done, which indicates that Bitcoin may be ready for its next leg up. Woo confirmed that profit-taking has been completed as he provided an update on Bitcoin’s Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). He noted that Bitcoin is undergoing a “very healthy reset, against a backdrop of capital flows into the network climbing again.” Other Bullish Indicators For Bitcoin Crypto analyst Crypto Jebb recently highlighted an inverse heads and shoulders pattern that had formed on Bitcoin’s chart. The analyst claimed this bullish pattern could send Bitcoin’s price to $100,000. The analyst also noted several other indicators currently signaling a bullish outlook for Bitcoin. One is the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD), which he claimed had turned very bullish on the daily chart and indicated that the bulls were regaining control. He also highlighted a ‘green red green’ formation on the daily chart, which, according to Crypto Jebb, shows that Bitcoin is “doing very well.” Related Reading: Crypto Alert: VeChain Bull Run Imminent, Expert Predicts 500% Rally Meanwhile, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto highlighted a striking similarity between Bitcoin’s 2020 post-halving price action and its price action after this halving.

Optimism Sees Higher Activity And Rising Transaction Fees According to a recent Messari report, Optimism’s circulating market cap increased 11% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) to $3.7 billion, while its fully diluted market cap rose 1% to $15.7 billion. Despite the broader crypto market rally, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) gaining 69% and 53% QoQ, respectively, OP’s market cap ranking slipped from 26th to 39th among all blockchain networks. However, within the Ethereum ecosystem, OP remains one of the top four rollups by market capitalization. Driving this growth was a significant uptick in Optimism network activity. Daily active addresses reached 89,000 in Q1 2024, a 23% QoQ increase, while daily transactions surged 39% to 470,000 over the same period. These metrics approached, but did not quite reach, their all-time highs in Q3 2023. Related Reading: Expert Sets Timeline For When Ethereum Price Will Begin Rally To $10,000 The network’s revenue also saw a substantial 78% QoQ increase to $16 million, driven by higher activity and a 48% rise in the average transaction fee to $0.42. However, this average fee dropped significantly in the latter half of March due to the implementation of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4844, which reduced L1 submission costs by 99%. Total Value Locked Jumps 18% In Q1 Despite the fee reduction, Optimism’s on-chain profit for Q1 2024 increased 14% QoQ to $2 million. The network’s Total Value Locked (TVL) also grew by 18% to $1.2 billion, though its TVL ranking among all networks fell to 11th place. Within Optimism’s TVL, the DeFi sector dominated, accounting for 86% of active addresses. According to Messari, non-fungible token (NFT) applications and gaming followed with 6.9% and 6.7%, respectively. TVL’s leading protocols included Synthetix ($307 million, +4% QoQ), Aave ($270 million, +52% QoQ), and Velodrome ($171 million, +10% QoQ). Optimism’s stablecoin market capitalization also grew significantly, reaching $809 million (+32% QoQ) by the end of Q1 2024. Circle’s USDC stablecoin and Tether’s USDT made up most of this, with USDT seeing a 64% QoQ surge to $512 million, or 63% of the total stablecoin market cap on Optimism. OP Rebounds Alongside Crypto Market Resurgence Despite Optimism’s strong performance across key metrics in Q1 2024, the network’s native token, OP, did not see a corresponding price increase at the end of Q1. Instead, OP followed the broader market downtrend, hitting an annual low of $1.80 just one month after hitting an all-time high of $4.84 in March. However, OP has followed suit as the overall cryptocurrency market has seen a resurgence of bullish momentum in the past few days. In the past 24 hours, the token has recorded a 9% price increase and a 3% uptick in the past week, currently trading at $2.56. Furthermore, CoinGecko data shows a 19% increase in OP’s trading volume over the past 48 hours, reaching $290 million. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $100,000: Infamous Head And Shoulders Pattern Appears To Signal The Start Of Another Rally While this renewed bullish sentiment is encouraging, OP still trades 46% below its all-time high and faces significant resistance levels soon before a potential retest of this milestone. The first key resistance is at $2.65, followed by $2.90, which must be overcome before the token can push towards the $3.00 level. Conversely, the $2.34 support level has proven crucial and must be monitored closely in case of any bearish resurgence.

The attack stole millions of dollars in users’ funds, but the reasons behind it and the exact amount of the loot were unclear. Amid the uncertainty, some claimed that a crypto Robinhood had emerged. Related Reading: Bitcoin Still Has “A Lot Of Room To Run Before Reversal,” Says Top Analyst $80 Million Taken In Crypto Heist? On Thursday, the platform Pump.fun announced its bounding curve contracts had been compromised. In the post, the team alerted users that all trading was temporarily halted while they investigated the incident. Pump.fun is a trading platform created to “prevent rugs” by ensuring that all created crypto tokens are safe. The platform allows users to easily launch instantly tradeable tokens with no presale and no team allocation. This solution became an extremely popular alternative among influencers and users who wanted to create tokens without the complexity or high costs of launching a project. It uses bonding curve contracts for the tokens, a mathematical model that determines a token’s price based on supply, increasing with the number of tokens bought. After the token’s market capitalization reaches $69,000, part of the liquidity is deposited on Raydium to be burned. Since the attack, the team has assured users that the contracts have been upgraded to prevent further fund loss, adding that the protocol’s total value locked (TVL) is safe. However, the community’s reports were contradictory and alarming. Some users claimed the attacker had taken $80 million in crypto from the platform’s bonding curve contracts, which worried the affected users. According to Lookonchain’s report, the hacker was quickly identified. At first, he pretended to be an unaware user, asking what the damages were. However, he later accused the platform’s founders of withdrawing the exact amount stolen a day prior. An X user claimed the individual chose to “be a Robin Hood, dropping hacked cash to $SOL communities.” The attacker also stated in a post his desire to “change the course of history.” However, his “heroic outlaw” endeavors affected 1,882 addresses. What Happened? Despite the speculation and the attacker’s posts, it was later revealed that he was a Pump.fun ex-employee. In its post-mortem post, the platform’s team revealed that the individual had used their position to misappropriate funds from the bonding curve contracts. The attacker illegitimately accessed the accounts after obtaining the private keys, “using their privileged position at the company.” The former employee used flash loans from Solana lending protocol to steal 12,300 SOL, worth around $1.9 million. Per the post, he borrowed SOL to buy as many tokens as possible in Pump.fun. When the tokens hit 100% on their respective bonding curves, the attacker used the keys to access the bonding curve liquidity and repay the flash loans. Fortunately, the attacker could only access $1.9 million out of the $45 million liquidity in contracts. Since then, the team has redeployed the bonding curve contracts and offered a plan to help affected crypto investors. Related Reading: Fetch.AI Soars 14.5% As AI Tokens Surge, Can FET Reach $4? To make users whole, the team will “seed the LPs for each affected coin with an equal or greater amount of SOL liquidity that the coin had at 15:21 UTC within the next 24 hours.” Moreover, they are offering 0% trading fees for the next 7 days.

28002177,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=608603,1715990421,Crypto Analysts Reveal Sub-$1 Altcoins Set To Outperform In The Bull Run,"With the Bitcoin price having already seen a massive rally over the past year, crypto investors have turned their attention to altcoins. This is because altcoin season usually comes after Bitcoin finishes rallying and they present more potential for upside. Ahead of the second leg of the crypto bull market that is suppose to happen sometime this year, the crypto analysts at Analyst Buzz have revealed the top altcoins that are trading under $1 right now that could be a good buy. Still Bullish On Polygon’s MATIC The first of the altcoins featured on the list is Polygon’s MATIC. This comes as a surprise, as MATIC has been one of the only top altcoins that has failed to see any kind of outperformance in the last year. However, this could be part of the reason why the analyst feels the altcoin is set to outperform. Related Reading: Why Is This Crypto Pundit Warning XRP Investors To Be At Alert For The Next 3-12 Months Despite rallying in the last day, the MATIC price is still down more than 75% from its all-time high price of $2.92. This is in start contrast to larger cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have either broken a new all-time high or come close to it this year. Ondo Finance Still A Top Contender Among Altcoins Ondo Finance has been making waves this year, and despite being relatively new compared to the other altcoins on this list, its performance has been among the top movers. The cryptocurrency was pushed into the limelight following its partnership with trillion-dollar asset manager BlackRock. In 2024 alone, the coin has seen an over 1,000% gain, going from $0.08355 to over $1 before correcting back downward. But despite this, the crypto analysts expect the altcoin to continue to perform well going into the bull run. Oasis Network (ROSE) Makes List Of Altcoins With Potential Oasis Network’s ROSE also makes it into Altcoin Buzz’s list of altcoins set to outperform in the bull market. This Layer 1 blockchain project had flown under the radar during the bear market, which eventually saw its price fall around 90% from its all-time high of $0.59. However, the price of ROSE is beginning to pick up now and is currently trading at what many call a steal at $0.091. Unlike the altcoins already mentioned, the ROSE market cap is still under $1 billion, which gives it a lot of room to run during the crypto bull market. Golem (GLM) Is Still In The Game? Featuring among the list of altcoins with the potential to outperform in the crypto bull market is GLM, the native token of the Golem platform. Golem has been in the crypto market for a while but it is only now that it is making its play as AI and computing become a leading narrative in the market. Related Reading: Why Did The Bitcoin Price Rise Above $66,000 Today? The project features a peer-to-peer distributed computing resource which allows users to interact directly with each other. As computing becomes an even hotter narrative, Golem could very well be a great investment. GLM is currently down around 57% from its $1.25 all-time high after a rather eventual start to 2024. Just like Oasis Network (ROSE), its market cap is still under $1 billion, making it one of the altcoins with the potential to run hard.
