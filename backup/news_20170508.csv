42399831,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbysYR,1494285336,Delaware Introduces Bill to Legally Recognize Blockchain Stocks,"Senators in Delaware have introduced a bill that would legally recognize blockchain stock ledgers and other business records.  Introduced on 4th May, the measure explicitly clears the way for ""the creation and maintenance of corporate records"" using blockchain. The definition would further capture a corporation's stock ledger, an accounting record used to keep track of when stocks were sold and to whom.  As the bill explains:  ""Any records administered by or on behalf of the corporation in the regular course of its business, including its stock ledger, books of account and minute books, may be kept on, or by means of, or be in the form of, any information storage device, method, or one or more electronic networks or databases (including one or more distributed electronic networks or databases), provided that the records so kept can be converted into clearly legible paper form within a reasonable time.""  Proposed legislative language for the bill first began circulating in March, following the release of a draft law by the Delaware State Bar Association's Corporation Law Section.  CoinDesk previously reported that Delaware has been seeking a path to integrating blockchain into its business records framework, working with industry startups and legal minds to develop a path forward. State officials have said they want businesses to start utilizing the tech sometime this year.  If passed, the bill would clear the way for blockchain-based proxy voting – a concept that one judge in Delaware has said would significantly improve conditions for investors.  The introduction comes just over a year after now-former Delaware Governor Jack Markell unveiled a wide-ranging plan to integrate blockchain into the state's business records processes.  At the time, Markell talked about the prospects of managing shares via distributed ledger, predicting a ""dramatic increase in efficiency and speed and an increase in commercial transactions"" would result from the tech's more widespread use.  Though the law could become effective as soon as 1st August if passed, because of the schedule by which Delaware’s legislature operates, it could be sidelined if work isn't completed before 30th June. In order to become law, both chambers of the legislature would have to finalize the bill before sending it to new Governor Jack Carney for approval.  Sources close to the effort tell CoinDesk that they are confident the bill will be completed and signed into law by that date.  Michael del Castillo contributed reporting.

42399847,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbysnC,1494279061,$25 Billion in 30 Days: Are Cryptocurrencies in a Bubble?,"The combined market capitalization of all public cryptocurrencies has surged nearly 80% over the last month, as more than $20bn worth of new investment dollars has flooded the nascent market.  In roughly 30 days alone, the market cap for experimental blockchain-based cryptographic assets has ballooned from $27.8bn to $49.5bn, according to data from CoinMarketCap, with the strongest gains observed outside of the market's historical leader, bitcoin.  A closer look reveals the total market cap of so-called 'altcoins', cryptographic tokens that seek to serve alternative use cases to bitcoin, has surged to $23.5bn, up more than 600% from just over $3bn in early March.  Amid this sharp rally, some market observers have expressed concerns that the asset class may have entered a speculative bubble.  When supporting his argument, Jacob Eliosoff, a trader who runs a cryptocurrency fund, pointed to not only to the price gains, but also the fact that so many cryptocurrencies – including those that haven't seen technical or business progress – have risen in value.  Eliosoff told CoinDesk:  ""I've been making the bubble argument for weeks. Doge, Dash, Litecoin, Stellar, Gnosis ... practically every coin has surged.""  He further cautioned that this development is ""a sign of unthinking buyers that will sell as soon as the tide turns.""  Daniel Masters, director of the regulated investment vehicle Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund (GABI), offered similar sentiment, emphasizing that even cryptocurrencies with smaller market caps – like litecoin, ether, namecoin and ripple – have all experienced strong gains over the last few months.  He told CoinDesk that he believes ""sentiment [is] too strong,"" noting that between this and record prices for cryptocurrencies, a bubble may be forming.  More room to grow  While the aforementioned analysts provided cautious viewpoints, other market observers were more optimistic, asserting that cryptocurrency prices have significant room to appreciate despite current prices.  Harry Yeh, managing partner of Binary Financial, took a bullish slant, telling CoinDesk that ""there's still quite a ways to move"" as more investors take note of big gains in the sector.  Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Currency Fund, also spoke to the market's potential. ""I would agree that prices have increased too far too fast, but I don't think it's a serious problem – more like a buying opportunity,"" he said.  He elaborated on this statement, pointing out that it is challenging to determine the ""true value"" of a cryptocurrency:  ""I'm not sure I would label it a bubble, at least not yet. It's quite difficult to definitively state what the intrinsic value is or should be of an altcoin,"" he said, adding:  ""Property is worth what people are willing to pay for it.""  Rising OTC trading  One strong indicator of the bullish sentiment is robust trading. While transaction volume for many of the digital assets listed on Coinmarketcap has risen, over-the-counter (OTC) trading firms have also reported an increase in activity.  Martin Garcia, vice president of Genesis Global Trading, noted that his New York-based firm is experiencing such an improvement.  ""Our new applications are up significantly, and old clients are circling back as well,"" Garcia said.  Ryan Rabaglia, head trader for Octagon Strategy, expressed similar sentiment.  ""Our desk has had [a threefold] volume increase over the last few months and over the last few weeks we're onboarding new counterparties at a record rate,"" he said.  Finally, Rabaglia spoke to the changing demands of his customers, emphasizing that while bitcoin and ether are still the ""hottest names,"" his trading desk has repeatedly received requests for trades involving lesser-known alternative cryptocurrencies such as ZEC, DASH, ETC and XRP.  Ultimately, he characterized the current market as one with abundant opportunities for his business.  He concluded:  ""Up to this point we've dabbled in each and are considering dedicating more resources if the demand persists.""

42399845,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbysmD,1494265814,Vermont Law Adds Bitcoin as 'Permissible Investment' for MSBs,"Vermont has passed a new bill that tweaks state law to account for digital currencies.  The bill  , signed into law on 4th May according to public documents, updates the state’s money transmission rules with a definition for ""virtual currency"". It was first introduced in February with six sponsors.  Money transmitters are also now allowed to hold digital currencies as a kind of ""permissible investment"", but with the caveat that this can be done ""only to the extent of outstanding transmission obligations received by the licensee in identical denomination of virtual currency"".  That the state would look to shore up its rules around digital currencies and money transmitters is perhaps unsurprising, given past developments.  A lack of concrete rules previously led to uncertainty among those who operated in that gray area, including bitcoin ATM owners. In early 2015, representatives from the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation said that the state didn’t need to pursue an approach like New York’s BitLicense framework, which some have criticized as too onerous.  The bill is Vermont’s second that focused in part on the tech. Last year, the state passed a measure that made blockchain records admissible in court.  With the measure’s signing, Vermont becomes the latest state to update its existing rules to account for digital currency business activity. States such as New York, North Carolina, Washington and Hawaii, among others, have pursued legislative approaches to overseeing the space.  Other states, including New Hampshire, have by comparison looked to deregulate aspects of the industry, particularly independent brokers.

42399843,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbysjG,1494260111,"Litecoin Mining Pool Disappears, Stoking Fears of Fraud","A litecoin mining pool seemingly pulled the plug over the weekend, stoking accusations of theft and fraud.  WeMineLTC, according to posts on social media yesterday, closed down their website and shuttered their Twitter account without explanation. Mining is an energy intensive process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain, with new coins minted as a reward.  Previous social media posts pointed to a growing host of problems at the mining pool. Last week, a WeMineLTC user took to Reddit and reported that the site had disabled manual payouts, stymying their attempts to withdraw. A post on BitcoinTalk indicates that at least some users began experiencing login issues in late March.  One of the older litecoin pools, WeMineLTC had attracted accusations of shady dealing in the past. Back in 2013, users alleged that the pool's operators were misappropriating funds through inflated or fictitious hash rates.  At this time, the scale losses by users of the mining pool isn’t clear.  One user claimed that at least several miners had lost more than 1,000 LTC apiece – at press time, the price of the digital currency is roughly $29.

42399836,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbysdM,1494256508,"Blockchain Regulations Likely By 2019, Russian Ministry Says","Russia's government is said to be moving ahead with plans to introduce rules for blockchain use by 2019.  According to state-owned news service TASS, the disclosure came from a report from the Ministry of Communications, which at press time was not publicly accessible. TASS reports that the documents touch on ""the adoption of legal acts"" related to blockchain, positing 2019 as the time frame for the update.  Notably, the Communications Ministry was one of several public institutions in Russia tasked with researching blockchain by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev earlier this year. In March, the former president also instructed the Ministry of Economic Development and the Russian Development Bank to research applications of the tech.  Medvedev has struck a somewhat bullish tone toward the technology in recent months.  During an investor event in Sochi in late February, he said:  ""I'm not against the use of [blockchain] technologies that have become widely circulated and which may thus decisively change our lives. It's quite an interesting story, but so far we do not see results.""  What remains unclear is how the regulation might dovetail with efforts in Russia to regulate cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.  Recent statements from senior officials of the Russian Finance Ministry suggested that bitcoin could be recognized as a kind of financial instrument next year, yet other Russian officials – namely one of its central bankers – cautioned that any determination is subject to review.

42399839,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbysfK,1494245733,Northern Trust Moves to Scale Up Live Equities Blockchain,"Northern Trust is preparing for more advanced applications of its blockchain platform.  After launching possibly the first fully functioning blockchain for trading private equities in February, the Chicago-based bank with $6.7tn assets under custody is now in the process of scaling up its work.  Initially comprised of four nodes powered by Hyperledger's open source Fabric codebase, and with Switzerland-based management firm Unigestion as the inaugural client, the blockchain has been processing transactions continually since the launch.  Over the next few months, however, Northern Trust plans to complete implementation of the beta version of Hyperledger's Fabric 1.0, the platform's signature distributed ledger technology which was first released in March and is one of several overall offerings.  Once complete, credentials will be given out to multiple clients, and the upgraded infrastructure will let the bank spin-up nodes for any number of limited partners, general partners and more.  Driven by what Northern Trust's senior vice president and global head of market advocacy, Justin Chapman, said was ""significant interest,"" the bank began the upgrade in April, embarking on a process he predicted will take several months.  Chapman told CoinDesk  ""The key for the upgrade is the expansion of the capabilities of nodes and scalability in that space for some of our clients who demand individual nodes.""  The upgrade will also feature an improved development kit, designed to simplify the transition process.  Due to disclosure restrictions around the asset class, Chapman said he wasn’t able to reveal transaction volumes of the live platform. However, he did report that the activity within the fund had met expectations.  ""We're comfortable we can scale that up across more funds,"" he said.  Product planning  Last year, a ""big chunk"" of Northern Trust’s blockchain investment went into issues of regulatory compliance with the Guernsey Financial Services Commission and the 48 other jurisdictions in which it is compliant. (The British Crown Dependency manages a node in which the investment vehicle is also compliant.)  However, this year, Chapman expects an investment to be made into building new products.  In addition to scaling the number of nodes, Chapman said Northern Trust has begun to explore which new types of assets would best suit the move to a blockchain.  As part of that effort, he said the company is now engaged in conversation with more than 100 private equity clients to determine exactly what other types of products might be suitable for the platform.  He concluded:  ""What we’re doing now is reviewing with other clients and other prospects the next stages of what we want to be launching in that ecosystem.""

42399830,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbysVU,1494243004,Litecoin is Giving New Life to Bitcoin's Most Experimental Tech,"Usually dismissed as less innovative than the more widely used bitcoin blockchain, the activation of a code upgrade called Segregated Witness (SegWit) is inspiring developers to give the smaller litecoin network a second look.  The fourth-largest public blockchain by total investment, litecoin is expected to formally add SegWit this week – a move that could pave the way for projects that are all but impossible to implement on bitcoin today. And, with the chances that SegWit will activate on bitcoin appearing less likely, the decision has put a new spotlight on litecoin, launched in 2011 as one of the first 'altcoins' seeking to optimize the bitcoin code base.  Now, projects that were seeking to build on top of SegWit on bitcoin are beginning to talk openly about using litecoin as a testbed that would hopefully prove their ideas on a live, public blockchain.  So far, the Lightning Network is the most concrete example of how some teams are adapting to the new possibility. Last week, one Lightning project released a version of its software designed to be compatible with litecoin.  But other projects that are dependent on SegWit look to be eyeing the bitcoin alternative as well.  Nicolas Dorier, bitcoin developer and CTO for distributed ledger startup Metaco, summed up the current mood by explaining that developers are simply becoming eager to continue their work in any way possible.  Dorier told CoinDesk:  ""[L]ots of developers assumed that SegWit would pass, and [they] built a lot of stuff. The last thing developers want is to see their work wasted.""  New migrations  Still, the transition won't be as easy as it might sound, as there is work needed to ensure both the litecoin code base and projects that seek to use it can make the switch.  For example, Johnson Lau, one of the lead developers behind MAST (which seeks to enable more complex smart contracts on bitcoin), now plans to implement the project on top of litecoin. So far, this has seen Lau taking a more active day-to-day role with litecoin's code, writing up a guide to help miners to prepare for SegWit activation.  Dorier, who also leads development of NBitcoin, a .NET library for programmers, mentioned that he has spent some time adding support for SegWit into the software.  After growing ""frustrated"" with the fact that SegWit wasn't activating on bitcoin, he made the library compatible with litecoin – a process that took him only a few hours, he said.  Dorier's other well-known project is NTumbleBit, an implementation of the theoretical decentralized coin mixer TumbleBit that works as a top-layer network similar to Lightning. (Dorier hopes eventually to add functionality that will allow users to exchange bitcoin for litecoin trustlessly and with more privacy via the service.)  ""That’s my goal,"" he said.  Momentum boost  The buzz over SegWit is also helping jumpstart previously announced litecoin R&D efforts.  For instance, another much-talked-about project that could see use on litecoin is 'confidential transactions', designed to shield sensitive data on public blockchains.  Litecoin developers have been working on implementing the idea since at least September, when Litecoin Core developer Xinxi Wang issued a development update in which he argued that SegWit would make it easier to deploy the privacy-focused technology.  Yet, when contacted by CoinDesk, Litecoin Foundation director Franklyn Richards said that the team isn't ready to talk about the project yet.  One potential problem is that confidential transactions take up about almost 20 times more space on the blockchain than normal transactions. Considering that blockchain networks have limited capacity today (prompting much caustic debate in the bitcoin space), this factor could perhaps represent a problem for litecoin further down the road.  Further, Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell, who's been working on confidential transactions, argued in a recent talk that it would be ""premature"" to add the technology to litecoin today.  Other developers, however, spoke to their desire to use litecoin, if only for short-term ideation.  Sergio Demián Lerner, a developer at bitcoin smart contract startup RSK, said the team is unlikely to change its plans depending on ""which blockchain activates SegWit first"".  He emphasized:  ""RSK is bitcoin-centered at this point.""  However, since the firm plans to open source the tech, it's possible that others will take up the reigns and build their own version on top of litecoin.  ""We will help any serious group that works to foster RSK technology,"" he added.  The caveats  Still, it's worth noting that there's an element of politicization in the works.  Despite the fact that litecoin has passed SegWit, as RSK's comments show, there's still a preference among developers toward the bitcoin network, which is seen as a more serious and more valuable long-term project. Further, the kinds of technical projects that are considering migrating efforts to litecoin are generally experimental and very early stage.  The combination of both factors has raised some concerns in the community.  While litecoin may enable a wave of youthful projects to test their ideas, some have expressed fears that in doing so they will 'pump' the value of litecoin's token by way of making grand technical promises that win attention from investors.  Already, litecoin's price has swelled to three-year highs on the SegWit news.  And Dorier, for one, has been mulling over longer-term problems, telling CoinDesk:  “Even if [SegWit] makes litecoin better for some use cases right now, the main problem is that the mining centralization issue is still not solved, whether it’s bitcoin or litecoin. If litecoin gets big enough, it will have the same problems that bitcoin is having right now.”  He pointed to the current favored way of making upgrades to bitcoin consensus rules, echoing the opinion that it unintentionally gives miners too much power to veto development upgrades.  The concern is, if this issue is never rectified on bitcoin, future litecoin upgrades along the lines of SegWit might have trouble getting support as its network and value grows.  With so much still uncertain, the takeaway might be that it’s still too early to know how (or whether) litecoin will play a role in bringing these projects to life as a get-around to bitcoin's long-standing scaling quagmire.  Still, Blockstream's Maxwell expressed general optimism about litecoin's upcoming SegWit activation, saying at a recent meetup:  ""You are going to have bitcoin developers working on litecoin eventually, because nobody really doing protocol development in bitcoin wants to do script enhancement without SegWit because it makes it so much easier.""

42427527,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyKVvzh,1494237757,Bonding Experience: Can Kenya Pave a Path for Blockchain Change?,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis and corporate finance, and a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.  A country with rickety infrastructure and a reliance on agriculture could be poised to kickstart mainstream use of blockchain technology.  I'm talking about Kenya, where last month, the government issued infrastructure bonds – with a twist. They were only available via mobile phones.  In a world first, the general public had access to government debt via an app. The M-Akiba project (akiba is Swahili for 'savings') aims to: 1) broaden participation in public financing, 2) stimulate the savings rate, and 3) raise funds for infrastructure investment.  The target was $1.5m, with the minimum investment set as low as KSh3,000 (approximately $30). It was open to all Kenyans with an M-Pesa mobile money account – well­ over half the population.  The issue sold out two days ahead of schedule.  Blockchain sweet spot  As CoinDesk reported this week, the World Bank plans to formally support the project with research on, among other things, how blockchain technology could simplify the underlying platform.  The use case is appealing. A recent World Bank report pointed out that the two main weaknesses of the bond issue were: 1) the intermediaries between the Treasury and investors, each charging fees, and 2) the lack of a liquid secondary market for the bonds.  A blockchain platform connecting the issuer and the buyer could lower costs and enhance yields. And a blockchain-based secondary market could improve liquidity and make the investment more attractive to retail investors.  The Commonwealth Bank of Australia is also looking at the blockchain for issuing bonds, as are Japanese securities firm SBI and French bank BNP.  However, comparing M-Akiba to other bonds-on-blockchain projects is missing the point. This isn't about adapting a current system to a new technology – it's about bypassing the current system altogether.  In 2007, Kenya’s leading network operator Safaricom started offering M-Pesa mobile banking accounts to anyone with a Safaricom phone number.  For many, the choice wasn't between their current banking system and M-Pesa, it was between no banking system and M-Pesa. The lack of a strong infrastructure propelled Kenya into the lead position in global rankings of mobile money use.  A similar trend could be happening to public investment in government bonds.  While Kenya has one of the most developed bond markets in Africa, it's still relatively new. It is also dominated by foreign and local institutional investors. With a minimum investment of KSh50,000 and significant paperwork requirements, small retail investors are largely excluded.  Opening up  But that could soon change.  Offering a 10% tax-free return (almost double that on standard savings accounts) with a low minimum investment and easy inscription, the bond is likely to appeal to a broad demographic, from long-term savers to first-timers.  The April issuance was a trial, and the government is planning a much bigger tranche of KSh4.85bn ($48m) on the M-Akiba platform for June.  The World Bank research on the blockchain potential is part of a broader initiative, and will not be completed for some time. Meanwhile, the technology will continue to develop, gradually removing obstacles to implementation. And the experience in Kenya shows that the market is eager for a platform that directly connects issuer and investor, and removes access barriers.  If this takes off, it could herald a new form of public financing and private savings.  The system could end up expanding, not only to other countries, but also other sectors, bringing in private issuers and offering the public an even broader choice of saving and investment vehicles. If users get accustomed to parking their money with bond issuers accessed via easy-to-use apps on their phones, this could change how they view banking. And, as such, it could change the banking industry.  The irony is that a country with a relatively unsophisticated financial infrastructure could end up kickstarting a fundamental reform that might achieve what higher-profile and better-funded projects have yet to pull off: putting the blockchain in the hands of the man on the street. And in the process, improving public finances and private wealth.

Revealed last week  , Overstock reported an $8m pre-tax loss related to the effort for Q1 2017, a figure that was up from the $3m loss it observed in Q4 2016, and down slightly from the $11.8m loss it saw for fiscal year 2016.  But, the filing also showed that 'loss' is perhaps best viewed as an investment in the firm's strategy to disrupt Wall Street.  As the documents show, the majority of the loss was tied to a $4.5m impairment charge connected to Overstock's investment in blockchain startup Peernova. Overstock invested $5m in the firm in March 2015.  As such, public statements found Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne striking a positive note, arguing that the company believes it is investing into a technology trend that will drive long-term value for shareholders.  Byrne said:  ""I remain confident that we are doing the right thing for our shareholders by having Medici pursue a position of global leadership in blockchain technology.""  That Medici is spending money is unsurprising, after all, last fall it launched its long-awaited sale of blockchain-based securities, netting a total of $10.9m. That move came more than a year after the sale of the first 'crypto-bond' for $5m.  Overstock has been active in the blockchain industry since early 2014, when it became one of the first retailers to accept bitcoin.
