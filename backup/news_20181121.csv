42402246,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3jhL,1542839410,Amended Suit Against Coinbase Details Bitcoin Cash Insider Trading Claims,"A new amended class action complaint has been filed against Coinbase, providing more detail on how insiders allegedly profited from the cryptocurrency exchange's rollout of bitcoin cash last December.  The document, filed Nov. 20 with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, outlines why the plaintiffs believe Coinbase ""made false and deceptive statements"" about its rollout of the bitcoin fork; how the exchange allegedly caused bitcoin cash's price to spike while simultaneously depressing bitcoin's price; and how insiders who knew Coinbase would list bitcoin cash were able to allegedly buy and sell the token before other customers.  The complaint explained:  ""As a consequence of this scheme, the Individual Defendants and Coinbase enabled Coinbase to earn significant fees from the trades of its customers, from which Coinbase earned a spread over an inflated price for BCH, and to avoid a 'run' on the Company by sellers anxious to take advantage of the inflated price, by closing down trading within minutes of the Launch to all except certain insiders who were positioned to and did sell BCH at inflated prices during the Launch.""  Tuesday's filing comes just under a month after a federal judge initially dismissed plaintiff Jeffrey Berk's original suit. At the time, Judge Vince Chhabria stated that it was unclear what Berk's legal basis was, what he believed Coinbase should have done or how the rollout could have gone more smoothly.  As such, the amended complaint alleges that the rollout failed to abide by the token listing standards on GDAX (now Coinbase Pro). Further, while Coinbase said it would let investors know ahead of time when it would permit bitcoin cash withdrawals, it instead opened withdrawals without warning, the suit claims.  When bitcoin cash was listed, only purchase orders were permitted on the platform, causing the price to spike, the plaintiffs allege.  The plaintiffs are seeking damages and restitution, in an amount to be determined at trial, as well as the costs incurred during the course of the lawsuit.  The document concludes by demanding a jury trial on the issues laid out.  While the amended complaint was originally due within 21 days of the previous order – Nov. 13 – the plaintiffs and defendants agreed to an extension, allowing the plaintiffs to file the new document on Nov. 20.  Moving forward  , Coinbase must provide a response by Dec. 20, and while both parties will have an opportunity to file another response each, a hearing has been scheduled for Jan. 31, 2019.  An attorney for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Coinbase declined to comment.

Touting itself as ""The Banking Platform for Innovators"" in its S-1 prospectus, filed with the SEC on Nov. 16, Silvergate Capital disclosed that the bank now serves 483 crypto clients, with a combined $1.7 billion in non-interest-bearing deposits as of Q3 2018. The number of clients is up from 114 on Sept. 30, 2017, marking an increase of 323 percent.  Its primary customers are crypto exchanges, with $793 million in deposits; institutional investors such as hedge funds and VC funds taking a focus on crypto assets, with $573 million in deposits; and other firms including new protocol developers and miners, with $227 million in deposits.  ""The majority of our funding comes from noninterest bearing deposits associated with clients in the digital currency industry,"" Silvergate states, adding that that ""unique source of funding"" offers an advantage over traditional financial institutions. Those deposits are invested into interest-earning deposits at other banks and investment securities, as well as into lending opportunities ""that provide attractive risk-adjusted returns,"" it says.  Capitalizing on its crypto relationships, the firm has developed its own crypto infrastructure, called the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) – a network of digital currency exchanges and investors that, it says, allows ""the efficient movement of U.S. dollars between participating digital currency exchanges and investors"" around the clock.  SEN was developed and tested in 2017 with some customers and opened up to all crypto-related customers in early 2018.  Bullishly, the corporation believes that the market for crypto-related financial services infrastructure solutions and services is ""significant"" and will grow as the crypto market grows.

Grant Thornton LLP, the U.S. branch of Grant Thornton International, reported in an attestation dated Nov. 16 that Circle had $127,412,240.89 held in custody accounts as of Oct. 31, 2018, slightly exceeding the 127,408,827 USDC tokens in circulation at the time.  As of press time, there were 162,968,332 USDC tokens in circulation, according to CoinMarketCap, with a total supply of 163,204,910.03 according to the token tracker attached to the USDC smart contract.  While not a full audit, the report confirmed information provided by Circle chief financial officer Naeem Ishaq about the funds backing up the stablecoin now jointly issued by Circle and Coinbase through the CENTRE Consortium.  In its report, Grant Thornton noted that its examination ""was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,"" meaning that ""the nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Reserve Account Information, whether due to fraud or error.""  The report went on to explain that:  ""In making an assessment of the risks of material misstatement, we considered and obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the preparation of, and the Reserve Account Information in, the accompanying Reserve Account Report in order to design procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of such internal control.""  Other stablecoin issuers such as Gemini and Paxos have similarly published attestations from auditing firms to support their holdings. While these were not full audits either they stand in contrast to the evidence of reserves provided by Tether, the largest issuer in the space at present.  The controversial company produced a letter from Deltec Bank and Trust Limited earlier this month proving that it had a ""portfolio cash value"" of $1.8 billion, though it is unclear whether it holds the funds in cash specifically or if other assets are also being considered.

42402265,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3jw6,1542813316,"In First Since 2015, Bitcoin's Price Is Testing a 200-Week Average","The pace of bitcoin's ongoing sell-off is setting new records with every passing day, the latest being its test of a key long-term moving average for the first time in three years.  Indeed, the world's most valuable cryptocurrency network fell below its 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) of $4,180 yesterday, marking the first break of the crucial support since August 2015. Back then, BTC was changing hands around $220, according to Bitstamp data.  The breach of long-term support, however, was short-lived as record low readings on the relative strength index (RSI) likely put a bid under BTC, helping it regain some poise.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $4,440, having clocked a 14-month low of $4,048 yesterday.  Notably, the recovery has established the 200-week EMA as the level to watch out for in the near-term. The already bearish technical setup would be bolstered further if the cryptocurrency finds acceptance below the long-term EMA support, leading to a deeper drop below the psychological support of $3,000.  Weekly chart  As can be seen above, the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from 2015 lows to 2017 highs lines up at $4,328 - just above the 200-week EMA of $4,180. So, it seems safe to say that the area between $4,100 and $4,350 is packed with key support lines.  The chart also shows that a break below the 200-week EMA could prove costly as the next major support is seen directly at $3,130 – the widely followed 200-week simple moving average.

The watchdog announced on Tuesday that the U.S. state's securities commissioner, Gerald Rome, has signed four new orders against Global Pay Net, Cred (doing business as Credits LLC), CrowdShare Mining and CyberSmart Coin Invest.  The companies all allegedly placed fraudulent statements on their websites with unverified data, false promises, claims of excessively high profits and dividends, insufficient disclosures and misrepresentation of facts, said the agency.  With these four new orders, the total count of orders signed against ICOs in Colorado has now reached 18. There are at least two more orders pending to be signed, taking the total cases to 20 since May, the agency said, adding that all these ICOs violated the Colorado Securities Act.  The spate of actions are the outcome of investigations by the ICO Task Force set up by the Colorado Division of Securities, which targets potentially fraudulent activities targeting investors looking to profit from cryptos.  “The sheer number of orders entered against ICOs should be a red flag to all investors that there is a real risk that the ICO you are considering is a fraud,” said Rome.  He added:  “Our investigations show that there are fraudsters who will simply create a fake ICO to steal investors’ money, or spoof a legitimate ICO to trick investors into wrongfully paying them.”  Earlier this month, Rome signed orders against Bitcoin Investments, PinkDate, Prisma and Clear Shop Vision.  Other U.S. state regulators are also increasingly taking action against what they consider fraudulent token sales.

Giga Watt was founded by bitcoin miner Dave Carlson with the plan being to open up the industry to smaller scale miners by creating customized mining “pods” along with a cheap and stable electricity supply and round-the-clock maintenance at a facility in central Washington.  As part of a plan to allow investors to buy a stake in the company’s services, it held an initial coin offering (ICO) in May 2017 that raised about $22 million-worth of cryptocurrency at the time.  However, this January, a group of plaintiffs sued Giga Watt for allegedly conducting an unregistered securities offering. The plaintiffs were seeking the return of their investments as the firm did not meet construction deadlines and then allegedly did not honor promises to refund contributions.

42402261,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3ju8,1542801635,The Crypto Insurance Market May Total $6 Billion. That's Nowhere Near Enough,"As Wall Street raises the stakes around cryptocurrency, large institutional players are circling this new asset class and bringing with them their own set of requirements.  For example, there’s a need for qualified custodians to hold the assets these big-money investors will trade, as in the traditional, regulated financial realm. But a less-discussed yet critical condition for making institutions feel at home is providing adequate insurance against theft for all those custodied assets.  The problem is that there's not enough of this insurance to go around.  While insurance is an opaque market, estimates of the total amount of coverage the industry is willing to provide to crypto custodians and exchanges top out at $6 billion – a drop in the bucket, considering that the top three exchanges each handle more than $1 billion of trades a day, to say nothing of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies of $140 billion, even after this week's brutal sell-off.  And that's the optimistic insurance scenario.  “Total available capacity for crypto-related crime insurance placements starkly lags demand,” said Jacqueline Quintal, financial institutions practice leader at insurance broker Aon Risk Solutions,  Insurance is critical for getting institutions to invest because unlike stocks and bonds, crypto is for all intents and purposes a bearer asset. Once a thief obtains the private keys to a wallet, the money is gone, like cash or jewelry pilfered from a safe.  And despite the 2018 bear market, crypto remains a juicy target for criminals around the world, as evidenced by kidnapping and extortion cases from New York to India. The large amounts institutions would hold would only compound the risk.  One reason for the shortage is that right now there's a chicken-and-egg problem for the insurance industry: there is almost nothing to go on in terms of a history of losses and claims, which underwriters crave to model the risks involved.  “Increasing numbers of policyholders will be looking for comfort that they have specific coverage that is expected to apply in the event of a blockchain-related loss,” said Daniel J. Healy, a partner in the Washington, D.C., office of the law firm Anderson Kill.  Coinbase's big score  In this context, it’s notable that one of the big exchanges, San Francisco-based Coinbase, has eaten up a huge chunk of the cover being written, with about $250 million worth, according to people familiar with the situation.  To put that figure in perspective, Quintal said limits depend on the type of wallets and storage but around $100 million is about right for an exchange doing a mix of hot and cold storage, i.e. online and offline wallets, respectively.  For purely cold storage, “you can get considerably north of that figure,” she said.  While Coinbase would not discuss numbers, Philip Martin, the company’s vice president of security at Coinbase, acknowledged that it’s one of the market’s largest consumers.  Noting that Coinbase has been active in obtaining crypto insurance since 2013, and that the market is still in its infancy, Martin told CoinDesk:  “We are definitely at the high end of coverage in this space ... There's not yet a ton of capacity.”  Greg Spore, US placement leader, financial and professional practice at insurance broker Marsh, cautioned to take any claims about a single company's coverage with a grain of salt.  “You do hear rumors in the market that an insured [party] could, for their own reasons, want to promote that they have more limits than they have; maybe their customers get a sense of comfort if they have greater limits and so maybe the stated limit is $200 million,” said Spore.  “But actually, there is some type of coinsurance provision, where it means, in reality, there is only $100 million in risk transfer,” since the insured party pays a share of the claim.  Crypto insurance 101  Stepping back, there are two distinct types of insurance product providing crypto policies today: the commercial crime market and the specie market.  Commercial crime covers things like cash in ATMs or moved around in armored cars, and it’s this market that generally provides coverage for “hot” wallets, where the keys are in a device connected to the internet.  On the other hand, the specie market has traditionally insured vaults or specially designed premises where high-value items like gold bullion or art are stored. It’s this sort of cover that custodians are looking at for cold storage, where the private keys to a wallet are kept on a piece of paper or an offline device.  Any large exchange is probably talking to both the crime and specie markets. Coinbase, for example, holds less than 2 percent of assets in hot wallets and the remaining 98 percent in cold storage. (At its height during the crypto bull market, the company stored $25 billion worth of assets on customers' behalf, but the company would not provide a recent figure.)  One large policyholder who has studied the market extensively estimated that the commercial crime market's capacity is relatively low, less than $1 billion and probably in the vicinity of $750 million.  This source, who did not want to be identified, pegged the specie market’s global capacity for crypto assets at $3 billion to $5 billion, for a total insurance industry appetite of $6 billion at best.  On a more granular level, Spore said he knows of specie consortiums that have the capacity to cover up to $660 million of cold storage only for a single entity. However, it's highly unlikely any crypto firm would get that amount, he said.  Conversely, hot storage-only capacity would not even approach $200 million, Spore said.  Pricing  There is also a stark disparity in premiums depending on whether the crypto being insured is in a hot or cold wallet. “In terms of the pricing, they are really in different stratospheres,” Spore said.  The way crypto insurance generally accumulates is via one or two underwriters who understand the risk deeply and then the rest of the capital follows their lead. For example, a lead underwriter may toss $5 million to $10 million of capacity to a “tower” and the rest gets filled out by 30 or 40 other syndicates.  In this structure, if there is a theft of crypto, the underwriter at the base of the metaphorical tower will be the first to pay claims after the deductible, followed by the next one up, and so on. The higher an insurer is in the stack, the less risky the position, and hence the smaller a premium it will demand.  There are at most half a dozen underwriters willing to take the first-loss position, numerous market participants said. (Underwriters are generally publicity-shy when it comes to crypto, but some big names linked to the space include AIG, Chubb and XL Group.)  Hence, the cost of cover for a mix of hot and cold storage works out to between 1 percent and 2 percent of total insurance purchased, usually depending on assets under custody, but that figure can be “highly variable,” said Quintal at Aon, which has been arranging insurance policies in the crypto space since the early days of 2014.  Cold storage-only solutions will get you closer to the bottom of the range, as will “high total limits,” she said, explaining that the first few layers of capacity (say, $5 million to $10 million) will be more expensive than the next and last ones, which drives the overall average rate down as you buy more.  Insurance of crypto assets is generally offered on an all-or-nothing basis. In other words, a custodian can't offer it as an option to each customer; it has to insure everything, according to Ari Paul, chief investment officer and managing partner at BlockTower Capital. This makes it expensive, and the cost is passed to investors.  If the custody service itself costs 50 basis points, for instance, then adding 1 percent to that is tripling the cost, noted Paul. ""One and a half percent total fees for custody is very high, compared to the traditional world. To a pension, that feels like a lot,"" he said.  All roads lead to Lloyd’s  Today the vast majority of crypto insurance is written out of London. That said, Coinbase’s policy includes participation from underwriters in New York, a first for the crypto space, according to a source familiar with the arrangement. The Bahamas is also said to be starting to show an interest in this market.  The hub for crypto cover, nevertheless, is Lloyd’s of London, the centuries-old insurance market where ship-owners and captains originally clubbed together into syndicates to spread the risk of losing their cargos.  Last year some 85 Lloyd’s syndicates, comprised of corporations and individuals, collectively wrote £33.6 billion ($43.3 billion) of gross premiums covering a wide range of property and liability.  Brokers have been working with Lloyd’s to educate underwriters and show that crypto insurance presents a significant opportunity to the London market (which last year took a battering thanks to numerous hurricanes and wildfires).  Yet, following an unprecedented announcement this summer that Lloyd’s was underwriting custody of crypto assets, industry sources said underwriters in the London market have put the brakes on this activity, under pressure from the umbrella organization of Lloyd’s.  “I wouldn’t call it a clampdown,” a representative for Lloyd’s told CoinDesk, adding:  “Lloyd’s has written a small number of policies in recent years for cryptocurrencies. However, in view of the fact that this is a new and rapidly evolving area Lloyd’s does require syndicates to proceed with caution and additional underwriting scrutiny.”  Independent reviews  While Lloyd’s wouldn’t give specifics on what form the syndicates’ additional scrutiny has taken, underwriters have been requiring independent reviews of crypto custody solutions carried out by technically adept third parties.  The cost is borne by the placing custodial company, and it does not come cheap.  “It will run anywhere from $50,000 to $150,000 for the company to come in and do that,"" said Jerry Pluard, president of Safe Deposit Box Insurance Co.  Financial costs aside, these reviews also require companies to open the proverbial kimono.  ""There’s a real concern for the custodians about exposing their proprietary information; that level of review starts at the foundation and goes up to the roof,” said Pluard.  Aon’s Quintal acknowledged the concern among custodians in sharing proprietary details, but said some degree of technology and security information is absolutely essential to securing a policy.  “Based on experience, there are ways to be specific enough without revealing too much,” she said.  Besides, engaging a company to survey a vault is a very traditional approach to underwriting, noted Martin of Coinbase, concluding,  “Maybe they are taking that approach with newer risks, or more risky risks, if you will.”  Lloyd's of London image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/11/21/the-crypto-insurance-market-may-total-6-billion-thats-nowhere-near-enough,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ee9e8bb8a1dc9644dea96d7353f2b88e4d4c8c7f-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402262,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3jz3,1542798119,$5K Bounce? Bitcoin Price May Have Hit Bottom For Now,"Bitcoin (BTC) could be in for a stronger recovery rally in the next few days, having found a temporary bottom near $4,000.  The leading cryptocurrency, which hit a 14-month low of $4,048 on Bitstamp yesterday, is now trading at $4,580, representing a 2 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  The $500 recovery seen yesterday indicates that the market is finally paying heed to the record oversold levels reported by the 14-day relative strength index (RSI). Currently, the indicator is still hovering in oversold territory below 30.00. As a result, BTC is unlikely to revisit yesterday’s low of $4,048 for now.  Further, the correction looks set to gather pace, as the RSI on the 3-day chart has dropped into the oversold region for the first time since January 2015.  3-day chart  Oversold readings on the RSI tend to put a bid under the cryptocurrency, historical charts show.  For instance, BTC bottomed out at $275 in the first week of October 2014 – with the sell-off looking overdone as per the RSI – and rose to highs above $400 in the next few days.  On similar lines, the oversold conditions signaled by the RSI in January 2015 likely triggered a recovery rally, pushing prices above $300 by mid-month.  As of writing, the RSI is hovering well below 30.00. Therefore, the cryptocurrency looks due for a break above $5,000.  4-hour chart and hourly chart  The bullish RSI divergence, seen on both the hourly and 4-hour charts, also indicates the recent sell-off has likely run out of steam near $4,000 and a relief rally could be in the offing.  Daily chart  On the daily, the primary trend remains bearish, as the 5- and 10-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) are sloping downwards. These averages, currently at $4,854 and $5,242, respectively, could cap any corrective rally.  View  Bitcoin could rise above $5,000 in the next few days, as per the oversold RSI on the 3-day chart.  The overall bearish outlook would be invalidated if the corrective bounce ends up pushing prices well above the 10-day EMA of $5,242.  The sell-off would resume if BTC finds acceptance below the 200-week EMA of $4,182, opening the doors for a drop below the psychological level of $4,000.

Announced  Tuesday, the MVIS Bitcoin US OTC Spot Index (MVBTCO) is said to be the first index that covers the performance of bitcoin on selected over-the-counter (OTC) platforms in the U.S.  The index represents the average spot price of bitcoin and tracks performance based on three providers in OTC liquidity: Circle Trade, Cumberland and Genesis Trading, the release states.  The index tracks just bitcoin and does not consider forks, according to the MVIS website.  “We are excited to be the first provider to launch a bitcoin index based on the pricing feed of OTC trading desks. This enables clients who trade over the counter to use this index as a reliable benchmark for their trades or potential investment products,” said Thomas Kettner, managing director at MIVS.  With the new addition, the firm said it now has a total of 24 digital asset indices.  Gabor Gurbacs, director of digital asset strategies at VanEck and MVIS, said:  “The index may pave the way for institutionally oriented products, such as ETFs as well as provide further tools to institutional investors to execute institutional size trades at transparent prices on the OTC markets.”  Back in June, VanEck partnered with financial services company SolidX in an attempt to launch the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), planned for listing on the Cboe BZX Equities Exchange.  However, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed its decision in August. Later in September, the SEC said that it has begun proceedings to decide whether to approve the proposed ETF.  Gurbacs told CoinDesk at the time that delay was entirely expected and that the company remained committed to bringing to market “a liquid, insured and appropriately regulated physical bitcoin ETF.”  Van Eck image via Twitter",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Yogita Khatri,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/11/21/vaneck-subsidiary-launches-index-tracking-otc-bitcoin-price,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6712ad81413e52c42059c6758846dbd7985044c7-525x275.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Antoine Dresch, co-founder of tech investment fund Korelya Capital (which led an $80 million funding round for Bitfury) and former executive at several major investment banks, will join Bitfury's board of directors.  At the same time, Annette Nazareth, a former member of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, has joined Bitfury's advisory board.  “Antoine’s years of experience in investment banking and mergers and acquisitions will be valuable assets as Bitfury continues to grow,"" said Bitfury's CEO Valery Vavilov in a press release. ""Annette will serve in a different capacity; as a trusted advisor, she will help guide and support Bitfury by offering her comprehensive knowledge on financial markets and regulation.”  Dresch had a long career in investment banking. Starting in 1997, he led Goldman Sachs' telecoms, media and internet group as vice president, and later worked as a managing director for the media and tech divisions at UBS London and Morgan Stanley, where he oversaw major mergers and acquisitions and initial public offerings in Europe.  In 2012, Dresch started his own consulting firm DDMA Ltd., advising tech investors in Europe, and in 2016, he founded Korelya, a 200 million euro fund, with Fleur Pellerin. Korelya's focus has been on European tech startups, including an investment in the crypto hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger.  On Bitfury’s board of directors, Dresch is joining Vavilov, George Kikvadze, Bob Dykes, and Bill Tai.  Regulatory expertise  Nazareth, an SEC commissioner from 2005 to 2008, has been a partner for ten years at the law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, where she is the head of the Washington, D.C., office and leads the Trading and Markets practice within the firm’s Financial Institutions Group, advising clients on regulatory issues.  On Bitfury's advisory board, she will oversee the company growth and provide expertise on financial markets and regulatory advancements.  ""She is an experienced financial markets regulator and recognized authority on regulatory issues. As SEC commissioner, she worked on numerous groundbreaking initiatives, including execution quality disclosure rules, implementation of equities decimal pricing, short sale reforms, corporate debt transparency rules and modernization of the national market system,"" Bitfury said.  The company met Nazareth through another advisory board member, Tomicah Tillemann, Vavilov told CoinDesk.  ""We were lucky enough to have Annette attend and speak at our annual Blockchain Summit in Morocco this past summer, where she joined other regulatory and legislative experts to discuss how institutions can be re-imagined to take advantage of new technologies,"" Vavilov said.

42402274,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3jx5,1542777650,Bitcoin Cash Is Now Two Blockchains – That Might Not Change Anytime Soon,"It’s been six days since the bitcoin cash split and neither side looks ready to call it quits.  What's more, cryptocurrency exchanges that froze holdings of bitcoin cash in lead-up to Thursday's contentious hard fork activation are beginning to warm up to idea that bitcoin cash may remain two cryptocurrencies.  On Tuesday, Coinbase, one of the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges, affirmed it was ""now prepared to resume limited trading in [bitcoin cash],"" designating the Bitcoin ""Adjustable Blocksize Cap"" or Bitcoin ABC chain with the bitcoin cash (BCH) ticker.  In addition, Coinbase added that its intention was to eventually ""support withdrawal services for the [Bitcoin Cash ""Satoshi Vision"" or Bitcoin SV] chain"" but that development work for this would likely take ""at least a few weeks.""  Other exchanges such as Poloniex and Bitfinex have already begun supporting active trading for both networks, simply doing away with the original BCH symbol entirely and differentiating the two cryptocurrencies as BCHABC or BAB and BCHSV or BSV.  In addition, data from Coin Dance indicates that the Bitcoin ABC chain is leading Bitcoin SV both in terms of block count and proof of work.  Despite the clear disadvantage in terms of market price and the number of blocks mined, proponents of Bitcoin SV affirm that plans to eventually outpace the Bitcoin ABC blockchain are unwavering.  Craig Wright, a leading Bitcoin SV proponent and the chief scientist at nChain – which developed the Bitcoin SV roadmap - told CoinDesk that ""We’re still competing. This is going to take some time. This is not a split, this is one survives and one dies and it is not going to be us that dies.""  Explaining that the Bitcoin SV chain would ultimately come out as the victor by “bankrupting” the other side, Wright contended that the current computational energy or “hash power” supporting the Bitcoin ABC network was unsustainable. Predicting that an eventual slowdown to hash power would enable Bitcoin SV to overtake the ABC chain and shut it down completely, Wright referred to his tactics as “persistence hunting.”  However, on the Bitcoin ABC side, proponents such as Roger Ver, CEO of mining pool bitcoin.com claim that the current hash power going to mine blocks on Bitcoin ABC can sustainably run for months.  In a weekly rundown of bitcoin cash news on the official Bitcoin.com Youtube channel, Ver said:  “It’s none of your business where the hash rate came from and it’s not for a single day, it’s for as long as we want. We can go for a single decade if we need to so bring it baby.”  Persistence hunting  As such, the competition between Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV is far from finished given persisting sentiment that a hostile takeover of either chain is well within the realm of possibility.  Wright claims that over the long haul his network will accumulate enough hash power to launch a 51 percent attack – which simply indicates possession of the majority of computing energy on the Bitcoin ABC network to create invalid transactions and blocks.  This has been an ongoing threat posed even before hard fork activation on Thursday.  Though most assumed such an attack would be imminent after the Bitcoin ABC chain took the lead in creating the longest-running bitcoin cash chain, Wright explained to CoinDesk that his method of fighting – which he called “persistence hunting” – was never about “quick bursts” of activity.  “We follow behind, we track them, we keep them on their tails, we basically make them expend money until they burn out,"" said Wright.  But speaking to the possibility of a 51 percent attack, bitcoin cash developer and supporter for Bitcoin ABC Chris Pacia emphasized in a Medium post published Saturday that certain measures had already been put in place to prevent massive reorganizations to validated blocks on the ABC chain.  Called checkpoints, the additional software unique to the Bitcoin ABC network ensures that no proposals to replace or “reorg” blocks before a certain “checkpoint” can be approved on the blockchain – no matter if the proposal is made by the longest running chain.  Though criticized as being against the core principles of reaching consensus on the blockchain, Pacia asserts that the technology of checkpoints has been widely used since 2010 even by the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, to safeguard the blockchain against 51 percent attacks.  Three-pronged approach  It’s important to note that the implemented checkpoint on Bitcoin ABC does not prevent possible reorgs of blocks created after hard fork activation.  Only blocks before the checkpoint are safe from malicious attacks by a competing blockchain, meaning, as Pacia hints in his article, they are useful to prevent against a 51 percent attack by Bitcoin SV miners “mining a hidden chain” since before the bitcoin cash split.  With new blocks being created each day on Bitcoin ABC, the likelihood of a 51 percent attack at present sabotaging any of these blocks through Bitcoin SV hash power is not out of the question.  However, Bitcoin ABC developer and miner Jonathan Toomim told CoinDesk there are a series of options.  First, the Bitcoin ABC chain can continue to mine at a loss to the bitcoin blockchain as suggested by Ver. Bitcoin ABC can also revert hash power to bitcoin and only redirect as necessary to the network when under threat of an imminent Bitcoin SV attack. Finally, on the matter of block reorgs, Toomim suggests:  ""There are also some technical solutions to protect against reorg attacks even without hash rate, like writing code that simply prevents reorgs that are more than six blocks deep. If we do either of those two things then we can get revenue parity with BTC while still keeping [Bitcoin ABC] safe from attack.""  When asked whether an alternative counterstrike on the Bitcoin SV network by Bitcoin ABC miners was possible, Toomim affirmed that while ""ABC could attack SV with hash power superiority .... we choose not to.""  ""The ABC side believes that anybody who wants to implement a coin with their own ruleset is welcome to do so. They may create and innovate freely without asking anybody for permission ... [Bitcoin ABC] has not used [hash power] to destroy BSV because that would be a violation of our beliefs. We prefer not to launch preemptive attacks,"" said Toomim.  Losses on both sides  Still, the reality is that both Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin ABC miners are mining at a loss.  According to figures on Coin Dance, bitcoin cash miners would make 75 percent more profit by mining the bitcoin blockchain than either the Bitcoin SV or Bitcoin ABC chain.  This is especially pertinent to mining pools such as Ver’s bitcoin.com, which has purposely redirected hash power away from mining bitcoin (BTC) to mine bitcoin cash (BCH).  But unlike before the split, the price of bitcoin cash is far from what it once was.  According to markets data site TradingView, the price of bitcoin cash a day prior to hard fork activation hit a high of $504.04. Since its creation, Bitcoin ABChttps://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BCHABCUSDT/ has barely shot over a price of $300.  What’s more, though Bitcoin SV reached a peak of $170.97 shortly after launching, the cryptocurrency has since declined steadily in value over the course of the past six days to sit roughly at $60.00.  As a result, several proponents of the wider cryptocurrency space assert that at present heavy losses are being experienced on both sides.  Saying that ""everyone lost"" and that damage had been done to the reputations of leaders on both the Bitcoin ABC and SV side, Ryan X Charles – CEO of online payments platform MoneyButton – affirmed with CoinDesk that events were ""not over yet.""  Agreeing with this sentiment, Taariq Lewis – CEO of digital payments network Promise Protocols – also affirmed that while the split had ""hurt the cryptocurrency's perceived value"" in the markets, his prediction was that both Bitcoin ABC and SV would continue to ""survive.""  ""They will both survive. [Dogecoin] survives and Bitcoin Gold survives. We have precedent that as long as a cryptocurrency has a community, it will not die,"" said Lewis.  As such, the question remains: will Bitcoin ABC continue to maintain the lead as the dominant bitcoin cash network or falter to suffer network attacks promised by Bitcoin SV miners who themselves may or may not have the resources to support such operations in the long-run?  At the end of day, the expected outcome to the ongoing bitcoin cash controversy as highlighted by bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver doesn’t look to be a “win” for either side.
