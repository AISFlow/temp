42426417,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJNbph,1436996148,Digital Advocacy Groups Critical of California Bitcoin Regulation,"While members of the bitcoin and blockchain industry have been vocal in their praise for proposed regulation in California, more broadly focused digital advocacy groups are taking a surprisingly critical stance.  In the latest bill analysis on AB-1326, filed on 13th July, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and Copia Institute entered opposition arguments, a position that places them at odds with bitcoin advocacy firm Coin Center, which has called the newest version ""vastly better"" in interviews and published materials.  The EFF's response, portions of which are now public via the state's website, suggests that the non-profit digital rights group believes the bill to be ""premature"" and ""technically inaccurate"". Founded in 1990, the group was an early supporter of bitcoin as a technology, accepting it for payments and supporting students who have faced legal issues as a result of industry-focused experimentations.  The EFF's filing reads:  “Virtual currencies are still developing, and this bill threatens to both stunt the growth of this innovative industry and hamper the enthusiasm driving consumer interest. Also, privacy and free speech are central issues in the virtual currency space, which the bill fails to adequately consider.”  Digital think tank Copia Institute was perhaps more broad in its criticism, arguing that the bill made little sense given the need for innovators to create without boundaries.  ""We should be exceptionally careful when implementing rules that have the potential to shape – or strangle – the very roots of innovation,"" the Redwood City-based firm wrote. ""New York, for instance, has already established BitLicense regulation, chilling bitcoin innovation in the state that is the financial center of the world.""  The comments notably follow more positive remarks by some of the industry's best-funded startups including BitGo, Blockstream, Chain and Xapo that lauded the bill even while suggesting it should provide more leniencies for early-stage firms.  The bill passed a final hearing in the Banking and Financial Institutions Committee today by a vote of 7-0, and now moves to the Committee on Public Safety for further deliberation.  EFF arguments  The EFF argued in its opposition to the bill that the state's definition of a ""virtual currency business"" was still ""overbroad"". This comes in spite of supporting filings from digital currency advocacy groups like Coin Center, which has argued the wording implements its preferred definition of custody.  The EFF, however, suggested that smart contracts, or agreements automated using blockchain-based technologies, could make custody frameworks more complex, as such arrangements could involve multiple parties.  ""The vague language of the bill will leave those in the virtual currency space unclear about their obligations and may also deter those who are thinking about getting involved in the nascent industry,"" the EFF wrote.  Technical issues with the bill, according to the EFF, include its assertion that transactions on a blockchain are approved in a fixed amount of time, a property the group says is not shared by other alternative blockchains such as those offered by Ripple, Stellar and Tendermint.  ""More generally, it is a mistake to mandate this kind of technical description given the large variety of possible technical designs,"" the EFF states.  The EFF further argued that the definitions are perhaps so broad they could be read as capturing video game currencies.  Copia's concerns  Copia suggested that it felt the bill had improved from initial versions, but went on to question whether licensing would be in the best interest of the industry's innovators.  In particular, Copia called attention to the rising interest among the general public in the blockchain, bitcoin's underlying decentralized ledger.  ""Bitcoin is just the currency aspect, and the blockchain itself is much more powerful. And there’s a real risk that when you set up a permission-based system for bitcoin you slide down a very slippery slope towards regulating all blockchain-based innovation,"" the group wrote.  Copia went on to note how understanding of the technology remains in the early stages, and that it believes it is crucial for this investigation to continue undeterred. It also evoked a letter issued by major bitcoin firms, which he asserted aimed to draw a similar conclusion.  ""Saddling new core infrastructure like Bitcoin and the blockchain with a permission-based framework sets the wrong tone entirely,"" the statement reads, ""and virtually ensures that Silicon Valley won’t be home to the leading innovators in this new and exciting space.""  Coin Center's take  Alternatively, Coin Center's Neeraj Agrawal and Peter Van Valkenburgh have suggested the bill remains improved in its current form when compared to New York's BitLicense, especially in wording that it feels excludes blockchain-based innovation.  ""The possibility of clearing and settlement and doing things on a ledger, you don't want those being swept up into a money transmission regime,"" Agrawal told CoinDesk. ""The BitLicense is so broadly drafted...the California bill seems to do a pretty good job with language.""  Agrawal and Van Valkenburgh went on to voice their belief that regulations like the California bill are meant to be ""narrowly focused"" on the traditional definition of money transmission.  ""It's odd they're applying it to a technology that can do so many things, but that's the role we've seen states play in the legacy payments industry and that's the field we'd like to see them play in the digital currency industry,"" Agrawal continued.  Coin Center also lauded the bill's clarity regarding multisig technology, arguing the bill overall does better than the BitLicense in zeroing in on rules that are typically the focus of state rather than federal regulators.  In this light, the team further voiced their hope that the current bill does not change, at least for the worse.  ""This is just now hitting the Senate, it can still be amended,"" Van Valkenburgh said. ""We still need to fight for what we have.""

42426419,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJNc3h,1436991029,Berklee Report Proposes Blockchain Royalty Network for Musicians,"A research study published by Boston's Berklee College of Music outlines how a blockchain-based royalty payment system could improve working conditions for musicians.  Published by Rethink Music, an initiative under the auspices of Berklee's Institute of Creative Entrepreneurship, the report outlines the current state of payments and revenue in the US recording industry and proposes a series of recommendations to improve transparency, reduce friction and provide a greater degree of fairness to working artists.  Among other recommendations, the report calls for the creation of a distributed rights database. This database ""would each have separate servers, synchronized with a main database, where they enter information about musical works, which would then be propagated around the world"".  The authors suggest that an implementation of the blockchain be used to create a payment network for artists as part of that database concept. The system, if built, would be programmed to split payments between parties whenever a work is purchased.  The Berklee report states:  ""The label would receive ¢68.175, and the recording artist would get ¢22.725. The blockchain network could also further divide this ¢22.725 between the members of a band, if applicable. This entire process would take place in less than one second, allowing all parties to access their money immediately after it is generated.""  Such a design would cut third parties from the process, ensuring that artists receive more revenue directly as a result of work sales and creating a transparent ledger of music industry payments.  The report also calls for education and certification programs for record labels that focus on fair music practices and the creation of a bill of rights for performing artists.

42426420,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJNc1h,1436985156,Bitcoin Firm Xapo Cuts North Carolina Access,"Bitcoin services provider Xapo has confirmed that it will no longer operate in the state of North Carolina.  The company, which recently moved its headquarters to Switzerland, cited state-level regulation as the decisive factor behind its decision. Earlier today, one North Carolina customer posted a message on Reddit stating that they had received a 30-day closure notice.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Wences Casares, founder of Xapo, said:  ""It is correct that we are not operating in North Carolina. We do not have a money transmitter license in that state and we think the effort to comply with their upcoming bitcoin bills is not justified by the number of customers we have there.""  As previously reported, an effort to regulate digital currency activity under the state's money transmission laws advanced in the North Carolina Senate earlier this week.  Casares declined to comment on the ongoing lawsuit with LifeLock.  Mounting regulation concerns  Xapo is not the first company to cease operations in a part of the United States amidst the development of regulation perceived to be onerous and potentially damaging to digital currency focused companies.  In June, San Francisco-based Coinbase announced that it was shutting down operations in the state of Wyoming until further notice, citing actions taken by the Wyoming Division of Banking.  ShapeShift recently revealed plans to stop serving the New York market following the official launch of the BitLicense digital currency regulatory framework, which came into effect last month.

42426421,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJNbzh,1436979692,Timeline: Putin Adds to Bitcoin's Rocky History in Russia,"Russian President Vladimir Putin issued his first remarks on digital currencies yesterday, telling the nation that while the technology faces challenges to adoption, it couldn't be dismissed.  The statements  , broadcast during an educational segment on TV channel Russia 24, conveyed a lukewarm response from the leader. While praising the Bank of Russia's advocacy against an outright ban on digital currencies, he also outlined a number of issues, including the fact bitcoins are ""backed by nothing"".  The comments, which one startup took as the ""biggest sign of bitcoin legality"" in Russia, follow a steady stream of statements made by government officials since the country's lawmakers first began discussing the issue last January.  The conversation is likely to escalate further ahead of the formal decision on a draft bill that would ban the use of digital currencies is still pending in the national legislature.

42426429,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJNcJh,1436964427,Has the Greek Crisis Increased Bitcoin Awareness?,"As the Greek Parliament readies to vote on a third bailout agreement today – which would inevitably seal the country's fate within the eurozone – there's still a steady stream of media reports suggesting bitcoin could prove useful to Greek citizens.  Although it's difficult to quantify whether the economic crisis has driven Greeks to purchase the digital currency, perhaps the more important question to ask is this: Have recent events even increased awareness of bitcoin in Greece?  One man's wish  Nikos Houtas owns Tavern Agelos – a traditional Greek restaurant opened by his father 20 years ago – and thinks ""virtual currencies are the future"".  Bitcoin is not new to him. His restaurant has been accepting payments in the digital currency for three years, after Houtas was introduced to bitcoin by an American friend.  Payments in the cryptocurrency, Houtas said, are still few and far between, but he hopes this will soon change.  Currently offering customers paying with bitcoin a 20% discount, Houtas told CoinDesk:  ""No one in Greece has asked me whether I accept bitcoin, but I hope that this will change due to the capital controls. Bitcoin has the potential to be successful in Greece, we need more stores to accept bitcoin and to offer a discount for bitcoin payments.""  The few bitcoin payments he has received have mainly come from European tourists, with the average transaction amounting to €10.

Agelos.gr pic.twitter.com/rn9qynNXXY        — Alyson Margaret (@alylovesbitcoin) July 10, 2015      Cracking the market  A recent Ask Me Anything (AMA) session Houtas took part in on reddit was well received by the bitcoin community. Inundated with offers from fellow bitcoin enthusiasts, Houtas was particularly taken with a proposal from a bitcoin ATM operator.  Commenting on reddit, Eric Grill, CEO of Coinoutlet, offered to meet with Houtas and discuss the possibility of installing a bitcoin ATM machine in his restaurant. Although the two have yet to meet, Grill told CoinDesk:  ""I do think bitcoin ATMs will be successful even if capital controls are lifted. The Greek people are now aware that the money they relied on is not under their control and can be used against them.""  Coinoutlet, however, is not the first company in the space to focus on the Greek market during the country's economic turmoil. Amid increasing speculation that people within Greece – fearing their country would crash out of the euro – had been buying bitcoin and inadvertently driving the the digital currency's price, some bitcoin exchanges waived fees for EUR/BTC transactions.  Other bitcoin ATM operators, such as Bitchain, are also attempting to crack the Greek market. Having installed a bitcoin ATM last weekend, J. Fenoy, CTO and co-founder of Bitchain, said he witnessed reasonable demand for bitcoin it the first couple of days since the machine's launch.  ""We have been pleasantly surprised by peoples' response. In the last two days, the working ATM machine has completed over 70 transactions and the support from the bitcoin community has been overwhelming.""  Bitchain has also temporarily waived commission fees.  Meeting the Greek bitcoin community  Miriam Liapi, a founding member of Bitcoin Community Greece – represented by Anthony A.Tsakoumis, founder of Bitcoinx.gr, at the first ever bitcoin meetup held in Athens yesterday – said incoming information requests on the group's Facebook page had soared by 423% in recent times.  Some of these requests portray concerns over the safety of bitcoin transactions and generally seek more information about the different ways in which the digital currency can be purchased. Exploratory enquiries, she added, are also flooding in from companies curious about how Greeks are surviving in the wake of the capital controls.  While it seems awareness of bitcoin has increased in the country, Liapi isn't convinced this is behind the recent increase in the price of bitcoin.  ""I am convinced that we are experiencing a new kind of war, a noiseless financial war ... I think the Greek crisis, amid other financial crises during this period, awakened citizens' fears about who is going to be next ... The citizens around the world have every reason to fear that their country might be next. This is where I attribute the rise of bitcoin's price. Not to the Greeks who, according to academic research, are late adopters,"" she said.  Spreading the word  Liapi believes more education is needed in order for bitcoin to reach mainstream adoption, a sentiment shared by Felix Weiss, a freelance programmer originally from Luxembourg, who is currently on a mission to raise bitcoin awareness in Greece.  ""There's still a lot of scepticism towards new technology in general,"" Weiss said.  He has devoted time recently to handing out bitcoin flyers to people protesting outside the Greek Parliament in Athens. What he learned during the exercise is there is a burgeoning interest in the digital currency.  ""Lots of questions were asked ... [but] unfortunately it's not easy to explain bitcoin in five minutes,"" he said.  Nevertheless, he still has still hope, explaining:  ""Bitcoin can now show people that they don't have to fight the old system. The solution is to stop using central bank issued paper bills and start using free, open source money: bitcoin.""  It's safe to say bitcoin has entered the spotlight once again, with numerous news headlines suggesting the people of Greece are turning to it in their droves.  In reality, there are few hard facts to indicate that understanding, acceptance and adoption of bitcoin have significantly increased in the country over the past month. The country's existing advocates are trying their best to push the agenda, but it seems there is still a long way to go.  Athens image via Shutterstock.

42426425,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJNcBh,1436950102,Hardware Vulnerability 'Could Compromise Bitcoin Private Keys',"Users storing bitcoin with hardware from a leading data protection company have been urged to update their devices or risk losing funds.  In a company blog post on Friday, Gemini CSO Cem Paya released details of a vulnerability he encountered that allows attackers to brute-force secret keys from SafeNet's brand of hardware security modules, or 'HSMs'.  These tamper-proof, specialist devices are used to safeguard all manner of cryptographic keys for the likes of governments, banks and payment companies. They've been hailed as the 'next step' for bitcoin security.  While testing the SafeNet Luna G5 for use in the forthcoming exchange's cold storage, Paya discovered a design flaw in its software that meant both public and private keys could be extracted – even though they are designed never to leave the device. Clients using any of Safenet's three HSMs to manage their bitcoin keys would be at risk, he said, adding:  ""Bitcoin is the one payment technology where possession of money can be boiled down to pure cryptographic capability: generating a signature with an ECDSA private key is money. If you lose control of that private key, you lose the ability to spend your funds, plain and simple.""  According to SafeNet, which released a fix last Thursday, the firm rated the severity of the vulnerability as 'high'.  Chris Dunn, VP of technology and crypto management at Gemalto, the company that acquired SafeNet in January, told CoinDesk there have been no known exploits so far. This, he added, was partly due to the specialised nature of the hardware – which can only be accessed by a trusted client.  ""Vulnerabilities with the HSM itself are quite rare and difficult to exploit given where and how customers deploy their HSM. The HSM also includes several usage and access control policies that can be used to protect against this type of vulnerability.""  Commonly, HSMs are held in air-gapped, covert locations that are only known to select staff members. Certain models are even programmed to self-destruct if they are compromised.  Bitcoin and HSMs  Though the company protects some 750 million encryption keys, relatively few of its 25,000 clients are using these machines to protect their bitcoin.  ""We ... have some bitcoin focused customers currently, however this is a new use case for our HSMs,"" Dunn said.  The devices are still a relatively niche, and costly, product for the bitcoin industry. However, as part of a wider move to traditional security standards – also visible in insurance – venture-backed companies like Gemini and API developer Gem are now utilising these bits of kit as part of their offline (or 'cold') storage solutions.  ""There are things [in bitcoin] we can do better than Visa, MasterCard and American Express, but they do a pretty good job of securing private keys. How do they do that? They do that through HSMs,"" Gem's COO Ken Miller told CoinDesk.  His company has been vocal about its eight-month integration with Thales, a manufacturer of military-grade HSMs, which required a team of engineers from both companies to create new software that allowed the machines to ""speak bitcoin"", not RSA.  ""We've since found out that a lot of really well-known companies in the bitcoin space have gone down this path and decided not to for that very reason, it's too much work,"" Miller said, adding that if enough people come knocking, Gem might consider reselling its custom machines.  By contrast, Paya said Gemini did not run into any significant compatibility issues when using SafeNet for bitcoin key storage. ""Their HSMs supported ECDSA algorithm as well as the specific bitcoin curve out-of-the-gate without any problems,"" he said, adding:  ""While I'm not familiar with the specific problems Gem face, I can say that each product has a unique set of strengths and weaknesses. Some units we are evaluating did not support bitcoin until recently, while others had OS/software issues that required additional workarounds.""  Future adoption  Due to its rarity, Paya said the vulnerability – now patched – does not impact Gemini's plans to use HSMs as part of its back-end security, or Safenet hardware in particular.  ""This vulnerability serves as a reminder that sometimes even the additional layers of defence that go above-and-beyond (such as using dedicated HSMs to manage keys) can fail,"" he said.  However, he added: ""HSMs remain the best-practice for managing cryptographic keys.""  Gem's COO agreed. While there is no silver bullet for companies to safeguard bitcoin and prevent attacks, the best strategy, he said, was one based on multiple layers of security – including HSM hardware.  ""Any hardware or software solution is only going to be as good as the implementation of that solution so it’s critical to be rigorous and thoughtful around the implementation, management, and review of the solution. But having the best available hardware solution is worlds better than not having it.""
