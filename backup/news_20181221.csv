42381427,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95lUj,1545427807,US Lawmakers Seek Sanctions Against Iran's Cryptocurrency Efforts,"A bill introduced this week in Congress takes a hard line on Iran’s efforts to develop its own cryptocurrency.  U.S. regulators have warned in recent months that Iran’s government wants to use a sovereign cryptocurrency, similar to the petro in Venezuela, to evade economic sanctions.  Portions of the Blocking Iran Illicit Finance Act, introduced by Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wisc.), call for a report on Iran’s efforts to create a sovereign cryptocurrency. A corresponding bill was submitted in the Senate by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). The proposals call for sanctions against those who knowingly provide Iran with funding, services or “technological support, used in connection with the development of Iranian digital currency.”  The move comes in context of the Trump administration’s decision in May 2018 to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).  ""Withdrawing from the JCPOA was only the first step in ratcheting up pressure on the Iranian regime,” Gallagher said in a statement. “We now have an important window to impose maximum economic pressure and degrade the Iranian regime’s ability to export violence across the region. This legislation does exactly that by effectively cutting Iran off from the international financial community.”  Iran has been in the news for a number of cryptocurrency-related issues in recent weeks.  Earlier this week an Iranian government official talked up the positives of embracing blockchain. Cheap electricity in the Islamic Republic has made Iran a hot destination for bitcoin mining farms.  Meanwhile, recently-released U.S. sanctions have ensnared Iranian bitcoin traders, one of whom later told CoinDesk that he’s innocent.

42381431,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95lZl,1545411334,Grin and Beam: A Tale of Two Coins Being Built on Mimblewimble,"Update: Beam's launch has been postponed until January 3.  Mimblewimble is about to go live – not in one, but in two distinct implementations.  On Dec. 30, and Jan. 15, respectively, two different networks – dubbed Beam and Grin – are expected to launch, each offering slightly different custom builds of the privacy-oriented protocol.  “So far, privacy has always been introduced at the detriment of scalability. We're changing that,” the pseudonymous Grin developer, known as “Ignotus Peverell”, told CoinDesk.  First proposed  in 2016 by an anonymous cryptographer called “Tom Elvis Jedusor” – loosely named after the Harry Potter book series' arch-villain, Voldemort – the tech was designed to solve privacy and scalability on the world’s largest blockchain, bitcoin.  The first implementation of the tech, Grin, began being coded in late 2016. In March 2018, it was joined by Beam, an Israel-based startup that's offering a slightly different interpretation of the technology.  An atmosphere of friendly competition between the two has taken shape since Beam’s announcement – though it's occasionally tipped into outright resentment from each side.  Whereas Grin followed a highly principled, cypherpunk ideology – including no token premine or ICO, as well as volunteer-based development – Beam sought VC funding and hired a team of developers to work on the software full-time, allowing it to speed ahead of Grin in its implementation.  Subtle differences in the design choices hint that while Grin maintains an emphasis on community-driven decentralization, Beam stands out for its sharper business sense.  Still, developers are urging on each side that due to their differences, and the two implementations will continue to co-exist – and even complement one another other. And both expressed a will to overcome the community tribalism that exists in the industry.  Guy Corem  , an advisor to Beam and the former CEO of Israeli-based bitcoin mining firm Spondoolies-Tech, told CoinDesk:  “We share a common goal which is to implement Mimblewimble in the most robust way possible.”  Harry Potter tech  What the designs have in common is their basis in the privacy-oriented protocol, Mimblewimble.  Stepping back, Mimblewimble was named after the Harry-Potter tongue-tying curse due to its ability to fuse transactions together such that they become indecipherable.  “It’s a privacy-centric chain in a new format without any of the baggage weighing down previous coins,” summarized Grin developer Yeastplume.  Yet while they’re alike in this respect, there’s a host of differences between Grin and Beam as well.  History  Grin, which prides itself on its large community, has been under active development since 2016.  According to the open-source code repository Github, its primary core developers are Antioch Peverell, Gary Yu, hashmap, Ignotus Peverell, Quentin Le Sceller, and Yeastplume.  It stemmed from a community that formed organically around the tech following the announcement of Mimblewimble throughout 2016, and became closely associated with the underlying technology.  Beam, on the other hand, came later into the industry, entering the space in March 2018.  Speaking to CoinDesk, CTO Alex Romanov said that while Mimblewimble seemed to be the best choice for a privacy-centric protocol at the time, the Grin development team was moving slowly.  “Grin is structured as a research project. They do not receive any outside funding except for donations, they do it part-time, they’re doing it very slowly,” Romanov said.  When it formed, Beam was treated with caution from the Grin community. And that’s in part because, on its early days, Beam was not open-source, leading suspicion to build surrounding the project.  “No one knew what we were doing and when there is something that is hidden there is speculation going on,” Romanov said.  Nowadays, though, Beam's code is public, and the two projects are feeding back on each other as well. For example, Beam even partially funded Grin’s security audit.  “Our projects take different approaches, but we're collaborating and exchanging ideas daily. [Mimblewimble] tech can only get stronger as a result,” Grin developer “Yeastplume” tweeted in late October.  Governance  One of the most significant differences between the two cryptocurrencies is their different approaches to governance.  For example, Beam takes its example from privacy-centric cryptocurrency zcash, maintaining a corporate structure, and funneling a portion of the block reward into a Foundation to support the blockchain’s development.  “Beam is a professional effort to create a privacy coin, there is an alignment of incentives within the block rewards so that the project won’t die,” Romanov said.  In this regard, Grin takes a different approach, relying on a community funding model that is similar to the one utilized by the monero project.  And while it’s a less reliable income source, Grin sees this as an advantage that ultimately increases the security of the project.  “The project has a firm commitment to not engage in any ICO, pre-mine, founder’s rewards, or similar activities,” Yeastplume wrote in a statement, adding:  “We are not driven by profit or corporate interests. We’re open-source and community-driven by design.”  Audience  Beam has a heavy emphasis on usability, having built a simple wallet interface that is considered central to the project’s overall value-add.  “Having a GUI wallet and mobile wallet will increase adoption, increase number of transactions and usage and will thus increase the anonymity set,” Corem told CoinDesk.  In addition to being designed from a user-friendly perspective, the wallet boasts implementations in different operating systems, including MacOS, Windows, and Linux. Beam will also release a light client alongside its mainnet release, Coreum said.  Grin, however, currently only offers a command-line wallet, and is less accessible for non-technical users.  “We’ll have a fairly well-tested MimbleWimble chain and a relatively stable and tested command-line wallet out, with all sorts of features in varying states of development to assist the community in creating unique transaction exchange solutions and other crucial infrastructure,” Yeastplume told CoinDesk:  “It’s still very much aimed at a technical crowd, and will be very much ‘use at your own risk’, especially in the early days.”  Design  Additionally, Beam is coded in C++, whereas Grin relies on a more contemporary coding language named Rust.  And while there are slight architectural differences, perhaps the most notable difference between the two cryptocurrencies are their economic models. In particular, Beam sees itself as a “store of value” coin that has a fixed issuance schedule akin to bitcoin.  “We wanted to create a confidential store of value coin, the emission to be limited,” Romanov told CoinDesk.  By contrast, Grin’s monetary policy is unfixed. Currently, a new token is issued every second. This is due to the project’s belief that sustained issuance will stabilize the value of the currency.  “We want Grin to be a currency, not a ‘store of value’ (whatever that actually means in the ridiculously volatile crypto space),” Yeastplume said. “We want to encourage use, and we don’t want to unfairly reward early adopters with an arbitrary deflationary halving schedule.”  Mining  The projects also have slightly different attitudes to mining, or the process by which new transactions are added to the blockchain.  Each project deploys a slightly modified version of Equihash, and both have committed to changes in order to manage highly-optimized, application specific integrated chips, or ASICs.  Currently, Grin combines Equihash with another proof-of-work algorithm, named Cuckoo Cycle, which is intended to block the use of ASICs by making the algorithm less predictable.  After two years, Grin will settle on Cuckoo Cycle permanently, with the belief that ASIC hardware will have become more affordable by that time.  Beam has announced a similar strategy, launching with a slightly modified version of Equihash that only general purpose hardware (GPUs) should be able to mine. However, it only intends to keep the ASICs at bay for a 12 month period, giving the GPU miners a “head start,” Corem said.  Going forward  For both cryptocurrencies, the launch of their mainnets represents only the first step.  “The long term vision is to be the best digital money there is, and with some more work I know we can get there,” Ignotus Peverell told CoinDesk.  Both cryptocurrency projects have plans to implement new and experimental features. For example, Beam cited its plans to integrate with BOLT, the privacy-centric lightning implementation, as well as adding atomic swaps and other features.  Yeastplume echoed this, telling CoinDesk:  “Launch is just another milestone in Grin’s lifecycle, and a relatively early one at that.”  Yeastplume cited “tentative plans for enhancements,” while Peverell said that ""we have tons of improvements in usability, scalability and privacy in mind.""  For example, concerns that both implementations may potentially be vulnerable to machine-learning analysis – due to the design’s failure to conceal inputs and outputs – are also under discussion.  While both teams currently implement a privacy feature named Dandelion to better conceal these potential leaks, there may be other experimental efforts that can be concluded as well going forward.  To support such changes, both cryptocurrencies will undergo regular system-wide software upgrades, or hard forks, in their early days.  Corem said that he hopes to see Mimblewimble implemented as trustless, privacy-centric sidechain for other cryptocurrencies, adding:  “Mimblewimble is putting the pressure on other cryptocurrencies to adapt and find the right tradeoffs, creating a net positive to the ecosystem.”  The headline of this article has been updated for clarity.

42381434,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95lcH,1545404424,Civil-Backed News Site Stores Full Article on Ethereum Blockchain,"A U.S. news article has been stored in its entirety onto the ethereum blockchain, in what its writer claims is a world first.  Maria Bustillos, editor with the journalist-owned Popula news site, announced Monday that she had archived an article originally published in Death and Taxes magazine onto the ethereum in full, as well as storing its hash on the IPFS protocol. As a result, the article will be preserved ""for as long as the ... blockchain and IPFS persist.""  Bustillos told CoinDesk that the goal of storing news articles irrevocably on a blockchain is one she has been pursuing as far back as 2012–2013, when she began writing about bitcoin.  ""Even in those early days it seemed to me that the key benefit of blockchain technology was decentralization, as a means of producing incorruptible records,"" she said. ""It was immediately evident to me, as a journalist, that this technology could be used to protect speech rights and press freedom.""  Bustillos further noted that in the past, many different libraries or archives have been destroyed both accidentally and deliberately, saying:  ""For the first time in human history it might be possible to create absolute receipts, absolute, unassailable, unchangeable, incorruptible records. That would mark an enormous turning point, if people were to value this development at its true value.""  The article was stored with the aid of blockchain journalism startup Civil and its engineers. Civil provided Popula with a grant as it began operations  The process of actually storing the article was carried out using MetaMask, and turned out to be far easier than expected. Bustillos said she was done archiving the article within half an hour.  Going forward, every article published on Popula will be stored on the blockchain, typically about 90 days after publication.  ""There are kinks still to work out, a viewer to build, and so on,"" she said.  Bustillos emphasized the difference between storing the full text of the article on ethereum and storing a digital signature as a hash on the IPFS network.  ""Digital signatures are important, but without absolute full-text archives to a broadly distributed public blockchain that anyone can join, and anyone can download, your work is still vulnerable,"" she explained. ""But once you've written full text to a real blockchain archive, as we are doing, it cannot be erased or corrupted. That difference can't possibly be overestimated.""

CoinVantage, formerly a subsidiary of accounting firm MG Stover, is joining with Picks & Shovels, a provider of tools for crypto investors, to become a new entity known as Interchange. The new, eight-person company features software products that will initially service over 100 clients, including fund administrators, hedge funds and digital exchanges.  Front- and back-office systems for managing crypto assets are an unsexy, yet potentially lucrative corner of the blockchain industry as more financial institutions march into the space. That’s where Interchange says it will have a stronger software product relative to its competitors.  “We’ve been working very diligently, and now we have these partners that are going to catapult our knowledge and lend expertise that is very rare,” Picks & Shovels co-founder and CEO Matt Galligan told CoinDesk.  CoinVantage was a subsidiary of MG Stover up until Friday’s announced merger. MG Stover is an early entrant into cryptocurrency management, being among the first firms to provide services to digital asset funds as early as 2014. CoinVantage was launched as an MG Stover subsidiary in November 2017.  “The merger with Picks & Shovels is going to allow the firms to combine systems to create a superior product,” MG Stover founder and CEO Matt Stover told CoinDesk. “We’re really excited about Interchange being one of the leaders in the tech space for digital assets.”  Picks & Shovels was founded by Galligan, Dan Held and Clark Moody. While Galligan had previously launched tech startups in the media (Circa) and social (Socialthing) arenas, Held and Moody are longtime cryptocurrency veterans. Held, who recently penned a four-part series on the history of bitcoin for CoinDesk, co-founded ZeroBlock (which was acquired by Blockchain in 2013). Moody was the founder of RTBTC, which itself was acquired by ZeroBlock/Blockchain in 2014.  As for the momentum behind institutional crypto, Galligan says moves like Friday’s merger could represent a trend heading into 2019.  “I think there will be a general theme around making participation in this asset class easier for institutions,” he said. “Portfolio accounting and reporting is a necessary function no matter the state of the market.”  Galligan declined to share the financial terms of the deal. Stover will remain as CEO of MG Stover and join the board of directors of the new company. Interchange will become the software platform of choice for MG Stover, according to a company statement.  Galligan says Interchange – which is fully distributed but with offices in San Francisco, New York and Denver – is actively hiring for engineers.

42381414,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95jGL,1545391912,Executives at Korean Crypto Exchange UPbit Indicted for Fraud,"The executives of UPbit, one of South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, have been formally charged by the country’s prosecutors.  According to a report from CoinDesk Korea on Friday, the Prosecutors’ Office of the southern district of Seoul has indicted three senior staff members, including founder Song Chi-Hyung, on charges of fraud.  The executives are alleged to have made fraudulent transactions between September to December of last year, using a fake corporate account to make bogus orders worth 254 trillion won (or $226.2 billion) to inflate trading volume figures and attract more customers to the exchange.  They are also accused of selling 11,550 bitcoins to customers to reap 150 billion won (or $133.8 million) through rigged transactions.  UPbit, however, denied the allegations in a notice issued Thursday, stating that, “The Company provided liquidity to the Company's corporate account in order to stabilize the trading market at the beginning of the service opening. This period is from September 24, 2017 to December 11, 2017."" It added that the corporate account does not have a withdrawal function.  The exchange went on to say that has ""not benefited or traded"" in this process, though it conceded it had made some transactions early for marketing purposes over about two months. They did not affect the market, UPbit claimed, and comprised about 3 percent of the total volume at the time.  Back in March, the prosecutors had also raided the UPbit’s head office in the Gangnam-gu district, by seizing its hard disks and accounting books. At the time, the exchange was suspected of fraud for allegedly selling cryptocurrency to customers that it does not actually hold.  The South Korean government has been increasingly taking action against crypto exchanges since the start of the year. In January, the country’s police and tax office officials raided Bithumb and Coinone exchanges amid an investigation into alleged tax evasion. In March, prosecutors raided three unnamed cryptocurrency exchanges over suspicions that staff embezzled funds from customers’ accounts.

42381420,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95jMd,1545387347,This Price Chart Indicates Bitcoin's Bulls Are Back in Business,"Bitcoin (BTC) is looking increasingly bullish on a key technical chart following its strong move above $4,000.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value first teased bullish reversal on Dec. 17 with the creation of an “outside reversal” candle on the widely followed 3-day chart. The early indicator of a bearish-to-bullish trend change, however, needed confirmation in the form of a positive follow-through.  Alongside BTC's $600 rally, the cryptocurrency closed above $4,000 yesterday confirming the bullish reversal on the 3-day chart.  BTC, therefore, could rise to next major resistance of $4,400 in the near-term.  As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $4,000 on Bitstamp, largely unchanged on a 24-hour basis.  3-day chart  Confirmation of the bearish-to-bullish trend change can be seen on the 3-day chart above, where the last candle has ended well above $3,590 – the high of Monday's outside reversal candle.  Adding credence to that positive trend change is BTC's move above the 10-candle exponential moving average (EMA) yesterday.  Further, the relative strength index (RSI) has jumped into undersold territory, validating a bullish divergence created on Dec. 15.  Daily chart  On the daily chart, BTC created a “gravestone doji” candle on Wednesday – widely considered an early sign of bearish reversal. The recovery rally from 15-month lows near $3,100 would likely have ended had BTC closed yesterday below $3,642 (Wednesday’s low).  The cryptocurrency, however, closed well above $3,924 (high of gravestone doji), reinforcing the bullish view put forward by Tuesday's convincing close above $3,633.  Other technical studies are also biased toward the bulls. For instance, the 5- and 10-day EMAs are trending north and the 14-day RSI is holding well above 50.00.  View  A bullish reversal is confirmed on the three-day chart.  BTC could extend the ongoing rally to $4,400 in the next few days.  A daily close below $3,633 would abort the bullish setup, although the probability of a bearish close happening in the near term is low.

According to the HKEX filing database, Ebang submitted the new draft application on Dec. 20 with disclosures of its financial information up until June 30 of this year, after its first application to sell shares on the exchange had lapsed.  Ebang's latest figures reveal that, for the first six months of 2018, it took 2.1 billion yuan ($304 million) in revenue – eight times as much as the same period in 2017. The profit for the first half of this year is also up significantly at $135 million. That's 16 times that seen in H1 2017.  In the ""Material adverse change"" section of the new filing, Ebang indicated that average monthly sales orders for its bitcoin mining machines in Q3 2018 were notably down, stating:  ""We experienced significant decreases in revenue and gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the preceding three months ended June 30, 2018. ”  However, the firm didn't choose to reveal detailed figures for Q3, when the overall crypto market started to take a notable dip – a factor that concerns the HKEX when evaluating IPO applications from crypto mining firms such as Ebang and Bitmain.  Based on the HKEX's current listing requirements, the financial period reported by any new applicant ""must not have ended more than six months from the date of the listing document."" As such, Ebang was compelled to disclose financial numbers up to June 30, but was permitted not to disclose its Q3 records at this point.  Nonetheless, a source familiar with the filings told CoinDesk both Ebang and Bitmain will both still have to disclose their Q3 financials to the HKEX at the beginning of 2019, should they want to move the IPO process towards a listing hearing.  While it remains unknown how much Ebang intends to raise, the source told CoinDesk its planned offer size has been “reduced by more than half” since the firm's initial filing. A Reuters report suggested in May that Ebang was seeking to raise as much as $1 billion.  Ebang first submitted its application to the HKEX on June 24, in which it revealed only financial information for the period ending Dec. 31, 2017. That application became inactive nearly six-months after the initial filing date.

Citing anonymous sources familiar with the plan, a Bloomberg report on Friday said the company will first focus on the Indian market to let users transfer money via a fiat-pegged cryptocurrency on WhatsApp, the messaging app Facebook acquired in 2014.  However, the report added the actual launch of the stablecoin could still be a way off, since the initiative is at a strategic planning stage. Currently, WhatsApp has over 200 million monthly active users in India.  India is also one of the largest markets for remittances, with migrants sending $69.59 billion back home in 2017 alone, according to the latest annual report from the World Bank.  Facebook set up its blockchain team in May, aiming to explore the emerging technology. It posted five job openings earlier this month, looking to add more members to its blockchain team with expertise on data science, software engineering and marketing.  David Marcus, who previously served as a vice president for Facebook's Messenger app division, heads blockchain team. In June, the firm appointed appointed Evan Cheng, a senior engineer, as its first blockchain engineering director.  ""If Facebook launches the stablecoin they are reportedly building, it will quickly become the most used product in crypto,"" tweeted Anthony Pompliano, a crypto analyst and founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital Assets, adding: ""The Indian government has been fighting crypto too so things are about to get very, very interesting.""  Meanwhile, other global messaging applications, such as Kakao, LINE and Telegram, have already revealed plans to move into the blockchain space.  In August, Japan's LINE became one of the first publicly traded companies to have launched its own blockchain mainnet with a cryptocurrency called the LINK token.

42381411,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95jCZ,1545368435,"The Crypto Winter Wasn’t the Real Story of 2018, and It Won’t Be for 2019 Either","Eric Piscini is the CEO of Citizens Reserve and the former blockchain lead for Deloitte.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.    Blockchain moves so quickly that last month’s news sometimes feels like ancient history. But instead of thinking about our crypto winter, this month I’ve been thinking about the early days of blockchain.      We’ve come a long way, but still have far to go. In 2012, I launched Deloitte’s blockchain practice with two friends, and the following year, I moderated a panel at the Money2020 conference. Blockchain was so new it didn’t even have a proper name yet: the panel I led was called “Bitcoin 2.0.”      However, we knew more would come from the industry. Charlie Lee, David Johnson, and Taariq Lewis were talking about self-governing organizations, about digitized commodities, and about decentralized business models. Most of the room was completely lost. I was energized.      As we close 2018, one of the key lessons is that the most important stories in cryptocurrency aren’t always the ones with the loudest headlines. Despite being the center of many discussions, the “crypto winter” doesn’t strike me as the key story of 2018. What do I think was more important?      First, the rise of “other” tokens — security tokens, non-fungible tokens, stablecoins, and equity tokens demonstrated the continued vitality of the blockchain community. That a single year, and a tough year at that, saw so many diverse and innovative products proves the enduring value of the blockchain.      Second, significant investments in cryptocurrency and blockchain infrastructure from traditional financial institutions and new technology companies mean we have much stronger foundations to build on: wallets, trading technologies, custodian solutions, exchanges, broker solutions, and more.      Finally, the regulatory environment. While a certain strain of crypto enthusiast might believe regulation sounds a death knell for blockchain, I think this viewpoint is misguided on two counts. First, regulation removes and discourages the bad actors who have done such harm to blockchain’s reputation. Second, regulation proves that blockchain is here to stay.      There’s no need to regulate a fad; it will expire well before a bill reaches committee. An enduring new asset, however, needs a place in a legal framework. Legislators have decided that blockchain is growing, not evaporating.    What do I expect to see in 2019? Given the speed and volatility of cryptocurrency, you’ll have to allow me some margin of error, but here’s what I see coming in the next 12 months:  Investing at the bottom:If we haven’t reached the solstice of the crypto winter yet, we’re very close; brighter and warmer days are coming soon. The early days of 2019 are the time to make bets on the best tokens and the best teams. I call it the new Rockefeller moment.  A new Howey test: The SEC’s increased scrutiny of blockchain has meant that blockchain proponents have had to learn about SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., the 1946 Supreme Court case that defined securities in U.S. law. I expect the courts to promulgate a new test for blockchain, which will let investors place their money with greater confidence.  Better core tech: It may have taken a bear market to drive this point home to some, but blockchain is not about getting rich tomorrow. We need to pay more attention to improvements in performance and scalability and pay less attention to new projects. #BUIDL is the new #HODL.  Decentralized business models: This may be the hardest of my predictions to imagine. In 2019, we will see the rise of decentralized businesses in banking, capital markets, payments, insurance, supply chain and other fields. The next Google or Amazon could make its appearance, but they’ll be very different: They won’t be looking for a place on Nasdaq, because they’ll be generating network value more than equity value.  A killer consumer app: While blockchain conferences were the killer app of 2018, we’re still looking for the product that will bring blockchain’s value to the non-tech, non-business consumer audience. I’ve tried a few apps that purported to be killer apps, but the experience was so bad I wonder if the developers thought killer apps were supposed to kill their users. I survived, and I’m hoping for more and better next year.  To return again to that long-ago Money 2020 conference: it’s rare to be speaking to a single visionary, much less three. Most of the ideas that Charlie, David and Tariq discussed that day were so forward-looking that they were, at the time, dismissed as impossible or ignored as incomprehensible.  Today, many of their ideas have become implementations. Tomorrow, more will follow.  I’m beginning to wonder if those pie-in-the-sky predictions for 2020 were, in fact, too conservative. Who knows what we’ll see next year? Sometimes, good ideas arrive too early. Time and again, I’ve seen that the difference between genius and stupidity, between a project that will succeed versus one that is premature, is 18 months.

42381401,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95j2V,1545361386,Wyoming County Moves to Put Land Records on Blockchain,"A county in the blockchain-friendly state of Wyoming is planning to put its land registry on a distributed ledger.  Teton County (pop. 23,265 ), which includes the town of Jackson and part of Yellowstone National Park, has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Medici Land Governance (MLG). The startup, majority-owned by Overstock.com's blockchain investment arm Medici Ventures, will build the new registry on the Open Index Protocol (OIP).  The new system will keep track of land transactions, such as mortgages, releases of liens and similar records, starting from 1996, Overstock said in a press release Thursday, adding that it will preserve existing privacy protections and public access.  ""The title information that is obscured for viewing on the current system will also be obscured from the blockchain-based system, but all public records will be available at the county clerk’s office,"" the release says.  “We are proud to see Wyoming lead the way in implementing cutting-edge technologies, such as blockchain, into existing markets like land registry,” Sherry Daigle, Teton County’s County Clerk, said in the press release, adding that if the new system succeeds, it can be expanded into other Wyoming counties.  OIP indexes files from storage or distribution systems such as IPFS and others using the Florincoin blockchain.  ""I’d heard Wyoming was working to proactively welcome blockchain and I wanted to support their efforts,"" OIP co-founder Devon James told CoinDesk via a spokesperson. ""I began attending Blockchain Task Force meetings and contributing to their public discussions, but I was particularly interested in their ‘Real Property Records on Blockchain’ initiative because the specification we’ve been working on for almost 5 years ...is a worldwide public database where anyone can publish, read, display, sell or audit the records, making it a perfect fit for their use case.""  According to Caitlin Long, a co-founder of the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition and ex-chairman of the enterprise blockchain startup Symbiont, the project began as an initiative of state senator Ogden Driskill, who brought several county clerks and James to the table to discuss the collaboration.  Wyoming has been aiming to become a leader among states in supporting blockchain technology for a while: in March, the governor signed into law a measure exempting utility tokens with certain properties from securities regulations, and a litany of similar bills was introduced recently.  There are in total six bills regarding blockchain regulation now waiting to be heard during the next legislative session in January, Long said. ""These bills were endorsed by joint committees and they have elevated chances to pass,"" she told CoinDesk, adding:  ""There will be more. This in an industry where nobody has leadership, and Wyoming moved to grab it.""  Long believes that the land initiative will be followed by others, and the next step for the state will be putting all its corporate registration and business records on a blockchain.  Medici Land Governance earlier this year announced a pilot with the government of Zambia to build a blockchain-based land registry for the African country. Medici Ventures owns 57% of the startup, and Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne owns the rest.
