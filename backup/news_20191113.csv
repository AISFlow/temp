As part of the deal, Uncork's founder Jeff Clavier was named to Messari's board of directors.  Uncork joins existing Messari investors including Blockchain Capital, CoinFund, Danhua Capital, Fabric Ventures, Semantic Ventures and Underscore VC, among others.  In a statement, Messari co-founder and CEO Ryan Selkis described ""one of the industry’s toughest problems"" as being the ""coordination challenges of self-regulating an emerging asset class and providing accurate, timely data to investors with diverse compliance requirements.""  In a Telegram conversation with CoinDesk, Selkis described Messari's relationship with Uncork:  ""Clavier is a straight shooter that hasn’t bought the crypto hype, but likes picks and shovels businesses building infrastructure in the space.""  The additional funding will help Messari automate on-boarding data and registry participants along with offering new products for subscribers in its self-described effort to sift out ""bad actors"" from the crypto space. Messari's funding round began last May, closing six months later. The ""broader macro challenges in the industry this year"" slowed securing funding quickly, Selkis said.  Founded in 2018, Messari offers investment products such as a Bloomberg Terminal–styled registry and data analytics via its Messari Pro interface, an API service. The firm says it has some 60 projects and several exchanges utilizing its data.  Disclosure: The author of this post is a former Messari employee.

42403543,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgGAi,1573659041,Kik Suffers Setbacks With 'Void for Vagueness' Defense in SEC Case,"Kik is struggling to mount a strong defense in a case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over its $100 million initial coin offering.  As reported last month, Toronto-based Kik's legal team attempted to persuade the district court of the Southern District of New York that the SEC's case – alleging the 2017 token sale violated securities laws – was void based on the premise that the legal definition of an “investment contract” is unclear. Kik argued that this ""vagueness"" precluded the definition from applying to its ""kin"" token offering.  The firm also sought to depose SEC officials in a bid to show the securities watchdog wasn't in a position to give clear guidance on token sales at the time of Kik's ICO.  The SEC, not surprisingly, vigorously opposed the ""void for vagueness"" defense, stating at the time:  “This defense asserts that, notwithstanding 70-plus years of well-settled jurisprudence, the term ‘investment contract’ in the securities laws is void for vagueness as applied to Kik’s investment scheme. This claim is untenable and should be dismissed.”  Soon after our previous report, the judge in the case, Alvin K. Hellerstein, sided with the SEC view and refused Kik's motion for discovery.  Not only that, but Hellerstein on Tuesday threw out a subsequent motion to reconsider from the former messaging app company, tearing up Kik's vagueness defense with the explanation:  ""Defendant's motion for reconsideration is a reargument of matters that were before me when I denied the discovery sought. Defendant does not mention any new matter of fact or law, or any binding precedent that I failed to consider. That is enough to deny the motion. Furthermore, as I originally held, the deliberations within an agency sheds no light on the application of the statute or regulation in issue. If the law is vague, or confusing, or arbitrary, as defendant argues, that can be argued objectively. Proper discovery should be focused on what defendant did, and not why the agency decided to bring the case.""  Last month, Kik's messaging platform was acquired by MediaLab, a holding company with Whisper and other apps in its portfolio. Kik CEO Ted Livingstone has said the SEC action prompted the sale.  So what's next? In the latest filing, also made public Tuesday, the SEC asks Judge Hellerstein to allow it to depose seven individuals after the current fact discovery deadline of Nov. 29.  These individuals include blockchain author and investor William Mougayar, kin app developer Luc Hendriks and Ilan Leibovich, who was Kik's VP of product around the time of the ICO. Hellerstein has yet to respond to the SEC's request.  The date of the next hearing is yet to be determined.

Bitski  thinks its developer platform can help the crypto sector overcome a key hurdle: For most folks, setting up a wallet is a pain. By having one pre-loaded into, say, your favorite video game, Bitski says its single-sign-on wallet can move the needle on mainstream adoption.  “We’re using this money to expand the funnel of people that are building on blockchain,” Bitski co-founder and CEO Donnie Dinch said of the $1.81 million in fresh capital. (The startup’s total fundraise is $3.54 million, including a late-2018 pre-seed round, Dinch said.)  Bitski also announced its product is being used by a pair of game development studios, an ethereum-powered sports betting site and YouNow, the live-streaming platform behind the SEC-regulated props token.  “There are a lot of projects out there that are interesting to the core crypto users but we’re trying to work on things that have broad mainstream appeal,” Dinch told CoinDesk, adding that gaming has been the company’s early focus.  ""We’re excited for Bitski to help catalyze the next wave of companies integrating blockchain into their products,"" Winklevoss Capital partner Sterling Witzke said in a statement.  The wallet’s simple UX does come with a tradeoff on self-custody, Dinch said, though the bet is most users will prefer to have a third party handling key management for them. All user wallets are stored using hardware security modules (HSMs) in ""biometrically-secured"" data centers, Dinch added.  Compound protocol founder Robert Leshner, who participated in the Bitski seed round through his Robot Ventures fund, says the startup could be a major on-ramp for new crypto users.  “Public-key cryptography is the bedrock of the growing decentralized application ecosystem – but as it stands, it's simply too cumbersome and confusing for a mainstream user experience,” Leshner told CoinDesk via email, adding:  “Bitski is a necessary experiment to (re)imagine how we interact with blockchains. They remove the friction and difficulty of wallet management, while preserving security and increasing portability.”  Bitski is currently a four-person team based in San Francisco.

42403533,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgG1r,1573648224,ASX-Listed DigitalX Seeds New Fund With Half Its Bitcoin Holdings,"The first ever cryptocurrency firm to be listed on a major stock exchange has launched a new bitcoin fund.  DigitalX, which debuted on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) under its previous name DigitalBTC as far back as 2015, announced the new fund on Wednesday. The firm said it's offering qualifying wholesale and professional investors such as family offices and high-net-worth individuals exposure to the cryptocurrency via a ""standard unlisted fund structure"" without the effort and risk of holding it directly.  DigitalX executive director Leigh Travers said in the announcement:  “DigitalX has held its bitcoin position through the 2017 bull market and 2018 drawdown because of our fundamental long-term belief in the value of the asset. What has become more and more apparent to us as we speak to investors and market participants generally, is that there is a growing interest in accessing bitcoin from people who have traditionally not considered investment in digital assets.”  To get the fund off the ground, DigitalX will provide 215 of its total 431 bitcoin, valuing its investment at around US$1.89 million at current prices. The firm said it aims to quickly grow the investment vehicle and hence its funds under management, and will see income via the fees receivable from the fund. Management fees are disclosed as being set at 1.65 percent annually, while no performance fees will be charged.  The fund's holdings will be secured via custody services provided by insurance-backed BitGo. DigitalX further plans to use ""blockchain-based security"" for the registration and transfer of units in the fund.  The Bitcoin Fund is licensed and administered by Boutique Capital, which is also the licensee of DigitalX's existing indexed crypto fund. Launched last April, that fund was said to give exposure to ""leading"" crypto assets and potentially ICO tokens.  DigitalX, following a move into bitcoin mining that was later abandoned, has morphed into a company offering blockchain consulting and development services and asset management. It's not been without its controversies, having been taken to court by investors over an ICO for which it acted as adviser. Its former executive chairman was also indicted by the US government for alleged involvement in a fraudulent text messaging scheme.

42403550,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgGEe,1573642811,"Telegram Refutes All SEC Allegations, Asks Court to Dismiss in New Filing","Messaging app firm Telegram has made a new plea to a U.S. court to drop an action brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleging its yet-to-be launched token is a security.  In a filing to the district court of the Southern District of New York on Tuesday, Telegram broke down and refuted all the allegations made by the SEC in its case brought last month, barring some fundamentals such as the nature of the company and its team and uncontested details of its fundraise.  On Oct 11, the SEC secured an emergency restraining order against the Telegram Group and its subsidiary developing the TON blockchain network against their $1.7 billion sale of gram tokens. SEC Division of Enforcement co-director Stephanie Avakian said at the time that the emergency action was “intended to prevent Telegram from flooding the U.S. markets with digital tokens that we allege were unlawfully sold.”  However, while sold, the gram tokens still are not yet issued or distributed to investors and were not to have been until the launch of the TON blockchain. That had been scheduled for Oct. 31, but was delayed by the SEC case.  ""[The SEC's] claims are without merit as Telegram’s private placement to highly sophisticated, accredited investors was conducted pursuant to valid exemptions to registration under the federal securities laws and Grams will not be securities when they are created at the time of launch of the TON Blockchain,"" said Telegram in the latest filing.  In its announcement of the court action, another SEC Division of Enforcement co-director, Steven Peikin, said:  “We have repeatedly stated that issuers cannot avoid the federal securities laws just by labeling their product a cryptocurrency or a digital token. Telegram seeks to obtain the benefits of a public offering without complying with the long-established disclosure responsibilities designed to protect the investing public.”  Telegram takes issue with this stance in the filing too, saying that the SEC has ""engaged in improper 'regulation by enforcement' in this nascent area of the law, failed to provide clear guidance and fair notice of its views as to what conduct constitutes a violation of the federal securities laws, and has now adopted an ad hoc legal position that is contrary to judicial precedent and the publicly expressed views of its own high-ranking officials.""  Telegram further claimed that it had ""voluntarily engaged"" with the SEC seeking guidance to avoid breaking federal securities laws. Yet the SEC ""failed to provide [guidance] prior to bringing this enforcement action.""  The company again stressed that its gram tokens have not yet been created, claiming that ""if and when they do, they will constitute a currency and/or commodity – not securities under the federal securities laws.""  Telegram conceded it didn't file a registration statement with the SEC because ""none was, is or will be required under the federal securities laws.""  As such the firm asked the district court to deny the SEC's claim for relief and dismiss the claims against it ""with prejudice and order such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.""

42403552,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgGIa,1573638760,"HSBC, SGX to Investigate if DLT Offers Efficiency Boost for Bond Markets","Can digitalizing bonds with distributed ledger technology (DLT) bring benefits to market participants?  That's a question being asked by HSBC Singapore in a new trial being developed in partnership with Singapore Exchange (SGX) and investment firm Temasek.  The effort will examine the potential of DLT to streamline the issuance and servicing of fixed income securities, debt instruments that pay fixed interest to investors, with a specific focus on the Asian bond markets.  In an announcement on Wednesday, HSBC sets out that, while the Asian bond markets have been seeing speedy growth, issuance and servicing of the instruments lack efficiency without a single platform for sharing data between different entities and tracking bonds across their lifecycle.  The trial aims to address that shortfall by tokenizing bonds using smart contracts on a permissioned ledger with the intention of streamlining these processes and easing friction in the markets. Ultimately, DLT could cut costs for issuers, investors, bond arrangers and custodians, the bank said.  HSBC is already deep in the blockchain and DLT space, having launched numerous projects involving the tech and often speaking out in advocacy. Last year the bank warned that ""digital islands"" could inhibit global blockchain-based trade. An exec also called on the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to make more “positive noise” about DLT to encourage reluctant businesses into using the tech.  While all this seems extremely bullish on the technology, Tony Cripps, HSBC Singapore CEO, argued that DLT's potential to reduce inefficiencies in the fixed income market still has to be determined. ""Only by collaborating with market participants will we fully understand its actual viability,"" he said.  ""Having HSBC and Temasek on board will enable us to evaluate holistically whether smart contracts and DLT can solve some of the long-standing challenges in the fixed income issuance ecosystem,” said Lee Beng Hong, head of fixed income, currencies and commodities at SGX.

42403542,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgG6m,1573635657,Three Fronts in the Global Digital Currency Wars,"Jeremy Allaire is co-founder, CEO and chairman of Circle, a global financial services company that provides a platform for individuals, institutions and entrepreneurs to build businesses, invest and raise capital with open crypto technologies.  The views expressed here are his own.    The past several months have brought dramatic new technology, market and regulatory developments in the cryptocurrency sector, with major global technology and state actors pushing forward digital currency initiatives.      These new initiatives are forcing global leaders everywhere to ask what the role of digital money will be in the next decade, and are ultimately a proxy for shifts in the broader political and economic landscape that are going to re-shape the future of the international monetary system.      Deep, fundamental digitalization of the economic system is now well underway as blockchain infrastructure moves from the fringe and early adopters and into the spotlight of major nation-state actors. Synthetic, crypto-powered central bank money tokens, and the introduction of smart contracts that can represent and tokenize other real-world financial assets and contracts are on the rise around the world.      These rapid changes are leading regulators everywhere to grapple with an economic system that is beginning to mirror the open, global and connected internet of information and communications.      At the foundation of these shifts is the rapid development of public blockchain infrastructures, such as ethereum, which allow market participants to issue cryptocurrency tokens representing fiat currencies and other financial assets. This “base layer” of trusted computing, record-keeping and transaction processing can be compared to the base layer of TCP/IP and HTTP, protocols that allowed the vast global internet to come into everyday use.      There are now several competing approaches to building a new financial system on this infrastructure.      1. Open finance      The first is represented by crypto-native ecosystem players, including Circle and Coinbase, who are building fiat-backed stablecoins such as USD Coin (USDC) on top of public blockchains. These developments are enabling a broad base of developers and companies to build higher-level financial constructs such as decentralized lending and credit markets, payments services and tools for trade finance.      Regulated by existing payments banking rules in the US and EU, these private market-based approaches are growing rapidly and help to form a pillar of the open finance movement.      2. Government-run      The second approach is best represented by China’s forthcoming Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) infrastructure, which aims to build an entirely controlled, centralized and permissioned infrastructure for a digital currency version of the Chinese RMB.      While likely appropriate for the Chinese economic and political model, this approach flies in the face of the open internet ethos and is not likely to receive much of an enthusiastic response from the broader internet development community.      3. Private consortia      The third approach, anchored in the proposed Libra Association and Libra Reserve Currency, attempts to build an “over the top” synthetic global digital currency.      Like China’s effort, the Facebook proposal creates a centralized, permissioned infrastructure for this payment system, which will radically limit how open and accessible the infrastructure becomes for developers and companies wanting to build on top of it.    Competing worldviews    In each of these approaches, we can extrapolate a fundamental worldview.      With the first, do we want an open financial system built on the public internet that allows value to move freely and easily anywhere in the world with strong privacy protection, one that enables people and companies to build financial arrangements in code, enforced by public blockchain infrastructure and enabling commerce and transaction arrangements between people everywhere? In short, do we want a global financial system built in the image of the internet?      Or, if the world embraces the Chinese approach, do we want a world with tightly controlled access to innovation in the financial system, with extremely tight controls on where capital moves and who can access the system? Such a system may enhance efficiency and global reach for the Chinese RMB. But will it mirror the tightly controlled internet that exists in China today? Will it be offered on equal terms to people and companies globally who seek to transact with China?      The worldview put forward by Facebook and Libra suggests a new global financial system that is controlled and run by the largest private companies in the world. And rather than building on existing sovereign money, the Facebook construct seeks to create a new global currency that stands above the state. Do we want a new global financial system controlled by a few private companies, where permission to participate and innovate is mediated on a closed infrastructure?      The largest governments in the world, especially those responsible for major global trade currencies, must now grapple with the innovation of public cryptocurrencies that have the reach of the global internet.      The choices they face, and the decisions that are ultimately made by relevant policymakers, will have a dramatic impact on what our future global economic system looks like.      Meanwhile, while governments study and debate these topics, bit by bit and block by block, technical innovators all around the world are using crypto to rebuild the global economic system in front of our eyes in a marvel of human ingenuity.
