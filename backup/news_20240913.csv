33555687,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641766,1726270232,Bitcoin On-Chain Health Remains ‘Net Positive’: ARK Invest Report,"Although Bitcoin (BTC) on-chain health remains net positive, from a price perspective two crucial support levels must be maintained for a continued bullish uptrend, notes ARK Invest in its latest monthly report. Bitcoin’s Healthy On-Chain Metrics, What Does It Mean? In its report, ARK Invest posits that Bitcoin requires some upside if its market structure is to be maintained. The report notes that in August 2024, BTC’s price slid by 8.7% to $58,972. The leading digital asset was also unable to overcome its 200-day moving average, making two key support areas at $52,000 and $46,000 critical for its bullish momentum. The report states that despite the temporary headwinds faced by Bitcoin, its on-chain health remains ‘net positive.’ Essentially, the Bitcoin network is net bullish across different on-chain metrics such as network security, network usage, and holder behavior. Bitcoin’s long-term holder supply, or BTC held for more than 155 days by holders, is up 3.3% month-over-month (MoM) and down a marginal 0.23% year-over-year (YoY). In addition, Bitcoin’s locked supply has increased in both MoM and YoY terms by 0.58% and 1.82%, respectively. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Supply Reclaims ATH, Return Of Conviction? Bitcoin’s transaction volume has tumbled by 24.5% MoM and 2.3% YoY, a bearish on-chain indicator. However, Bitcoin’s bullish on-chain metrics overshadow the one bearish indicator, allowing its on-chain health to remain net positive. Another key performance indicator strengthening ARK Invest’s bullish stance on Bitcoin is its short-to-long liquidation dominance. Essentially, this metric measures short-term liquidations relative to long-term liquidations over the last 90 days, and found that it’s at its lowest since Q2 2023. Bitcoin ETF Investors Underwater At Large The report highlights that at the end of August 2024, the estimated cost basis of US spot exchange-traded-fund (ETF) participants was higher than BTC’s price, hinting that the average ETF investor may be at a loss. The higher estimated cost basis of US spot ETF participants compared to its price can be confirmed from the chart below. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this year, which made it easier for institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to the world’s largest cryptocurrency through a compliant investment product. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Approval Triggers $1.2 Billion Trading Volume And New Highs For BTC Price Bitcoin ETFs are witnessing unprecedented interest from institutional investors. Specifically, Wall Street titans such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have poured millions of dollars into Bitcoin ETFs. Conversely, Ethereum ETFs haven’t yet piqued institutional interest at comparable levels. At press time, Bitcoin trades at $57,836, up a minimal 0.2% in the past 24 hours. BTC’s total market cap stands at $1.14 trillion.

42407632,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0HsE,1726269017,"Even Temporarily Blocking Election Contracts Risks 'Irreparable' Harm, Kalshi Argues","Prediction market company Kalshi should be allowed to list and trade its new political contracts while the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission appeals its court loss, the company said in a filing Friday.  Kalshi, which won a significant victory in court last week when a federal judge ruled its political prediction markets should be allowed to trade in the U.S., said the CFTC wouldn't suffer any major harm if its new contracts were allowed to trade during the appeal process, but the company would ""suffer substantial – indeed, irreparable – harm"" if it's blocked from letting people bet on the outcome of the 2024 elections.  ""A stay will deny Kalshi significant revenue derived from trading these contracts. Indeed, a stay would strip the Congressional Control Contracts of any value derived from the current election cycle – which will be over long before this appeal concludes,"" Kalshi said. ""In effect, a stay would allow the CFTC to win in practice even though it lost in court.""  Kalshi filed to list the markets last year, but was blocked by the CFTC, which cited concerns about political prediction markets. The company sued and won last week. The CFTC filed for an emergency stay blocking Kalshi from immediately listing its contracts, but lost that fight too. The contracts went live Thursday afternoon, before being temporarily suspended by the D.C. Appeals Court while it considers the emergency stay.  Kalshi's filing on Friday is an effort to convince the appeals court judges that it should be allowed to trade its contracts while the CFTC's appeal of the overall case works its way through the court system.  The stay would block Kalshi from making back the ""millions of dollars"" it spent building and marketing its new products, the filing said, while also blocking it from ""carv[ing] out a competitive niche"" in a world where offshore platforms like Polymarket enjoy their own prediction markets.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/09/13/even-temporarily-blocking-election-contracts-risks-irreparable-harm-kalshi-argues,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/df5d478b2ec2720467e5f6cc9336ba7ced55ba1d-2500x1406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Despite the bullish momentum, on-chain data reveals that long-term holders are beginning to take profits. The ratio of daily on-chain transactions in profit to loss has turned positive, suggesting that many investors are capitalizing on recent gains. Related Reading: Injective (INJ) Breaks $18 Resistance: Investors Expect Higher Prices As the market continues to evolve, ADA strives to maintain its uptrend, buoyed by positive sentiment and growing optimism for further price recovery. However, this profit-taking activity indicates that some investors are cautiously locking in gains, potentially leading to short-term price volatility. With high expectations for a continued rally in the coming weeks, investors are closely watching ADA’s performance to see if it can sustain its momentum. The next few days will be critical for confirming whether Cardano can hold above these levels and push toward new highs. Cardano Long-Term Holders Selling Cardano is testing local supply levels after a significant surge, with investors becoming cautious in their short-term strategies. Yesterday, the ratio of daily on-chain transactions in profit to loss reached 1.53, meaning that for every ADA transaction resulting in a loss, 1.53 transactions have generated profits. This metric highlights that many investors are taking advantage of the recent price gains, leading to some long-term holders selling their coins for profit. Data from Santiment supports this view, showing a slight decline in Cardano’s Mean Coin Age and Mean Dollar Invested Age on September 11. These metrics track long-term holders’ behavior, reflecting the average age of ADA coins and the amount invested over time. A drop in these metrics suggests that holders who purchased ADA at lower prices are now taking profits, decreasing the average age of the coins in their possession. Despite this selling pressure, ADA still has the potential to maintain its bullish momentum if market conditions continue to push. Cardano could target higher prices, but the cautious behavior from seasoned investors signals that the rally might face resistance soon. Related Reading: Is Chainlink (LINK) $12 Breakout Imminent? Data Reveals A Rising Open Interest The coming days will be crucial for ADA, as it needs to hold above its current levels to confirm a continued uptrend. If buyers regain control and demand increases, Cardano could break through key resistance levels and aim for new highs. ADA Price Action Details ADA trades at $0.3565 after testing a key resistance at $0.36. The price has closed above the 4-hour 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.3490. This is a significant indicator of short-term strength that ADA had respected as resistance since early August. This successful reclaim of the 4H 200 EMA is crucial for maintaining the uptrend. If ADA manages to retest this EMA and hold it as support, it would confirm a short-term bullish trend. Breaking and holding above this level suggests that ADA could continue to push upward. Investors and analysts see the next target as being in the $0.38 to $0.40 range. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Rally Brewing? On-Chain Metrics Suggest Investors Optimism However, if ADA loses this support level, the price could drop to lower demand zones, possibly retreating to around $0.33.

In a recent statement, the firm reiterated a school of thought that has been gaining momentum within the financial world for years. According to the investment company, BTC is a good tool for hedging against increasing global disorder, which might arise from growing distrust in governments, banks, and fiat currencies. Reflecting on this perspective, renowned cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe aligns with BlackRock’s outlook, predicting a Bitcoin price as high as $600,000 in the current market cycle. BlackRock’s Involvement With Bitcoin There’s no denying the fact that BlackRock’s decision to foray into Bitcoin in 2023 through applications of Spot Bitcoin ETFs was a turning point for the cryptocurrency. As the biggest asset manager in the world, this move sent ripples throughout the investment community and affirmed Bitcoin’s growing role as a legitimate asset class. Related Reading: XRP Price To Reach $40? Crypto Analyst Says You Should Get In Right Now CEO of BlackRock, Larry Fink, who was once a proud Bitcoin skeptic, changed his stance and became an advocate of investors adding Bitcoin to their portfolio in order to hedge against inflation. According to him, Bitcoin “is an asset class that protects you.” In a similar statement, Blackrock noted that Bitcoin could be a “hedge against increasing global disorder and declining trust in governments, banks, and fiat currencies.” This comes amidst inflation concerns in economies all around the globe since the beginning of the year. The company’s perspective echoes the sentiments of many investors who believe that as the cracks in conventional financial systems become more apparent, BTC will play a critical role in preserving wealth as its value continues to increase in the future. An example of such investors is Michaël van de Poppe, who is a staunch Bitcoin enthusiast. In reply to a social media post mentioning BlackRock’s comments, van de Poppe noted that Bitcoin’s current valuation is still very low. In terms of a correct valuation, the analyst notes a target between $300,000 and $600,000. Bitcoin currently trades at $57,983, which represents price increases of 417% and 935%, respectively. This explains it all. The current valuation of #Bitcoin is still super low. I wouldn’t be surprised with $300,000-600,000 this cycle. https://t.co/5GUaBPMZ6A — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) September 12, 2024 What’s Next For BTC? Although BTC is up by 3.89% in seven days, it continues to hover beneath $58,000 in what seems like forever. This is because Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which recently went on two days of inflows after weeks of consecutive outflows, recently registered another day of outflow. This could suggest a slowdown in a growing bullish sentiment among institutional investors. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Accumulation: Whales Pull Out $4 Million From Exchanges, Can SHIB Recover?

42407639,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0I5S,1726256652,"Sam Bankman-Fried Appeals Fraud Conviction, Requests New Trial","FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has formally appealed his fraud conviction, requesting a new trial and accusing the judge overseeing his case of being unfairly biased against him.  Last November, a New York jury convicted Bankman-Fried of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy tied to the collapse of his crypto exchange in November 2022. In March, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison for his crimes.  In the 102-page appeal filed Friday afternoon in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, Bankman-Fried’s lawyers argued Judge Kaplan was unfair to the FTX founder throughout the trial, making “biting comments undermining the defense” and “deriding” his testimony in front of the jury.  “Sam Bankman-Fried was never presumed innocent,” his lawyer, Alexandra Shapiro wrote in the filing. “He was presumed guilty by the judge who presided over his trial.” Shapiro took over from Bankman-Fried's trial lawyers, Mark Cohen and Christian Everdell, after his conviction.  The filing emphasized this point throughout, pointing to the judge's blocking of certain defense arguments, including testimony about Bankman-Fried's well-performing investments (such as Anthropic).  Bankman-Fried's lawyers also charged procedural violations, saying the judge ordered an ""unlawful"" forfeiture and ""Bankman-Fried was erroneously deprived of Brady material"" – evidence that would have favored the defense which, if deliberately withheld, could result in the case being thrown out.  The 32-year-old Bankman-Fried's trial lawyers had suggested a lighter sentence of 6.5 years. The government had sought a much heftier 40-50 years in prison.  Several of Bankman-Fried’s closest friends and colleagues – including his ex-girlfriend Caroline Ellison, Nishad Singh, Gary Wang, and Ryan Salame – testified against him during his trial, and pleaded guilty to their own counts of fraud. Salame was sentenced to 7.5 years in prison in May. Ellison is set to be sentenced later this month, and has asked for no jail time.  Bankman-Fried’s defense, as well as his supposed grounds for appeal, have heavily rested on the customer recovery achieved by the FTX estate. Bankman-Fried has insisted that the collapsed exchange was never actually insolvent, and claimed that he was pushed to file for bankruptcy prematurely by the estate team, including turnaround CEO John J. Ray III and white-shoe law firm Sullivan & Cromwell.  In his appeal, Bankman-Fried’s attorney criticized a ruling from Judge Kaplan that blocked Bankman-Fried from claiming to the jury that FTX customers had not actually lost money, because they were expected to get it back in the bankruptcy process.  “The government thus presented a false narrative that FTX’s customers, lenders, and investors had permanently lost their money,” Bankman-Fried’s lawyer wrote. “The jury was only allowed to see half the picture.”  The defense team also alleged the DOJ worked with the bankruptcy estate more closely than was allowed, but used the veneer of distance to block Bankman-Fried from accessing potential Brady materials.  ""The district court summarily refused to order discovery, or even a hearing to determine whether the Debtors and their counsel were an 'arm of the prosecution,'"" the filing said.

33548805,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641722,1726254050,Is DogWifHat (WIF) The “Most Bearish” Of All Major Meme Coins?,"Meme coins have been sliding in recent weeks. According to Coingecko, all meme coins’ total market cap is around $42 billion. Dogecoin remains the most valuable, with a market cap of over $15.4 billion, followed by Shiba Inu, which has a market cap of around $8 billion. It has been a turbulent few trading months for meme coins, whose valuation is down from over $65 billion in Q2 204. WIF Struggling, Is This The “Most Bearish Meme Coin”? Though Bitcoin is turning the corner, a development that can yank top altcoins like Solana and meme coins higher, one analyst is bearish on DogWifHat (WIF). According to Coingecko, WIF is one of the top meme coins on Solana, commanding a market cap of over $1.5 billion and a slot in the top 5. Related Reading: POPCAT Jumps 20% As Whales Load Their Bags, Is A ‘Cat Season’ Ahead? While WIF might be up over 98,000% after dropping to all-time lows of $0.00155 in December 2023, the token is down 68% from recent all-time highs. WIF prices exploded, riding on Solana expansion and the meme coin fever that swept across the industry in the first half of the year. The analyst now thinks WIF will likely dump in the coming sessions. Driving this outlook is the state of the chart pattern, which points to weakness all through. From how the WIFUSDT chart is aligned, the token, the analyst claims, could be the “most bearish of all major meme coins.” Bulls Have A Chance If Bitcoin Recovers, DogWifHat Finds Resistance At $2 While there is optimism that WIF could bounce and benefit from the market-wide recovery, the current bearish structure damps optimism. From the analyst’s assessment, buying the meme coin at spot prices is risky. The only time traders can consider loading WIF is once it breaks out from the descending wedge, as is evident in the daily chart. Related Reading: Legendary Bitcoin Puell Multiple Finally Enters ‘Buy’ Territory In summary, WIF is down nearly 50% from July highs. Although prices recovered after the bounce in early August, buyers didn’t build sufficient momentum to reverse losses. The immediate resistance is $1.99, while support is $1.30. For the uptrend to take shape, WIF bulls must break above $2, ideally with rising trading volume. In turn, this may set the momentum for another leg up that could see the token expand to as high as $3–or July highs in a bull bar continuation formation.

Given these advancements, many expected Artificial Superintelligence Alliance to experience a significant surge in value. The combination of AI and gaming—a sector that continues to grow exponentially—seemed like a surefire way to attract new investors and boost the FET token’s price. However, despite these efforts, FET’s performance in the market has been overshadowed by the incredible rise of Mpeppe (MPEPE). The Surprising Success of Mpeppe While Artificial Superintelligence Alliance was focusing on technological partnerships, Mpeppe (MPEPE) was quietly building an army of supporters. This meme coin, which started as a simple internet joke, quickly gained traction through its strong community and viral marketing strategies. What began as a light-hearted project rapidly transformed into a serious contender in the cryptocurrency space. Mpeppe’s success can be attributed to a few key factors. First and foremost is its ability to harness the power of social media and community-driven promotion. Mpeppe’s supporters, known for their enthusiasm and creativity, have created a sense of camaraderie around the coin, making it more than just a financial asset—it’s a movement. Secondly, Mpeppe’s simplicity and accessibility have made it appealing to a broad audience. Unlike Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, which requires a deep understanding of AI and blockchain technology, Mpeppe is easy to understand and invest in. This has allowed it to attract a wide range of investors, from seasoned crypto veterans to newcomers looking for the next big thing. Impending Future of Artificial Superintelligence Alliance and Mpeppe As we look to the future, the question remains: can Artificial Superintelligence Alliance’s (FET) technological prowess eventually catch up to Mpeppe’s momentum? Or will Mpeppe (MPEPE) continue to dominate the market, fueled by its passionate community and viral appeal? Artificial Superintelligence Alliance’s recent price performance indicates potential growth, with some analysts targeting $3.4 as the next major resistance level. The FET token has shown resilience, holding above crucial support levels and gaining bullish momentum. However, Mpeppe’s ability to capture the imagination of the market cannot be underestimated. In the short term, Mpeppe appears to have the upper hand, with its value continuing to climb at an astonishing rate. However, in the long term, Artificial Superintelligence Alliance’s focus on real-world applications and technological innovation could see it reclaim its position as a leader in the crypto space. For now, investors and analysts alike are watching closely as this battle between AI-driven utility and meme coin hype unfolds. One thing is certain: both Artificial Superintelligence Alliance and Mpeppe have proven that in the world of cryptocurrency, anything is possible.

33548758,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641863,1726254011,AI vs. Meme Coin: Here’s Why Analysts Have Placed All Bets with Artificial Superintelligence Alliance Rival Mpeppe,"In the world of cryptocurrencies, a fierce battle is brewing between two contrasting forces: the sophisticated, utility-driven AI tokens and the community-fueled, hype-driven meme coins. This battle is epitomized by the ongoing rivalry between Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET), an artificial intelligence-driven cryptocurrency, and Mpeppe (MPEPE), a meme coin that has taken the crypto world by storm. The Birth of Artificial Superintelligence Alliance Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) has long been considered a pioneer in the realm of decentralized artificial intelligence. With its platform designed to empower autonomous agents to perform complex tasks in a decentralized economy, FET has captured the attention of developers, investors, and technologists alike. The platform’s ability to enable efficient machine-to-machine communication, facilitate smart contracts, and optimize various processes across industries has positioned it as a promising player in the AI and blockchain space. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance’s recent partnership with GameSwift, a modular Ethereum Layer-2 solution designed for GameFi, further solidified its status as a leading AI-driven cryptocurrency. By integrating its AI agents into GameSwift’s gaming platform, FET aims to harness the power of decentralized AI to enhance the gaming experience. This move was expected to boost FET’s value, attracting a wave of new investors eager to capitalize on the synergy between AI and blockchain technology. However, despite these advancements, FET’s performance in the market has been volatile. While the token has managed to secure some bullish momentum recently, analysts remain cautious as FET continues to face challenges in breaking through key resistance levels. This uncertainty has prompted some investors to explore alternative opportunities, leading them to consider Mpeppe (MPEPE), a rapidly rising meme coin that has captured the market’s imagination. The Unexpected Ascendancy of Mpeppe While Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) was making headlines with its innovative partnerships, a seemingly unlikely competitor was quietly gaining momentum. Mpeppe (MPEPE), a meme coin born out of internet culture and driven by community enthusiasm, began to capture the imagination of the crypto community. Despite lacking the technological prowess of FET, Mpeppe leveraged the power of virality and social media to create a loyal following and a sense of camaraderie among its holders. What started as a simple joke quickly transformed into a movement. Mpeppe’s community, united by their shared belief in the coin’s potential, began to actively promote it across various platforms, creating a buzz that spread like wildfire. As the meme coin narrative gained traction, Mpeppe’s value skyrocketed, surprising even the most seasoned analysts. The meteoric rise of Mpeppe (MPEPE) has been a stark contrast to the more gradual growth of FET. While FET continues to build on its solid technological foundation, Mpeppe has demonstrated the unpredictable power of community-driven projects in the cryptocurrency space. This success has led many analysts to reconsider the dynamics of the market and to place their bets on Mpeppe. Why Analysts Are Betting on Mpeppe The success of Mpeppe (MPEPE) has led many analysts to take a closer look at the factors driving its rise. While Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) remains a strong contender in the AI space, Mpeppe’s rapid ascent highlights several key dynamics in the crypto market: Community Power: In the crypto world, community engagement can often be more valuable than technology itself. Mpeppe’s success is a testament to the power of a dedicated and enthusiastic community. Analysts recognize that in a market driven by sentiment, the collective actions of a strong community can propel a coin to new heights. Accessibility and Simplicity: Mpeppe’s appeal lies in its simplicity. Unlike AI-driven tokens like Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET), which require a deep understanding of complex technology, Mpeppe is accessible to anyone with an internet connection. This accessibility has allowed it to attract a broader audience, including those who may not have previously invested in cryptocurrencies. Market Momentum: Mpeppe’s rapid rise has created a self-reinforcing cycle of hype and investment. As more people buy into the coin, its value increases, attracting even more investors. This momentum has led analysts to predict that Mpeppe could continue to outperform more technologically advanced tokens in the short to medium term. The Future of Artificial Superintelligence Alliance and Mpeppe While Mpeppe’s (MPEPE) success is undeniable, it’s important to remember that the cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) has a strong technological foundation that provides it with long-term potential, especially as AI and blockchain technology continue to evolve. However, in the current market climate, where meme coins are thriving, Mpeppe has proven that it can hold its own against even the most sophisticated competitors. As we move forward, it will be fascinating to see how these two contrasting tokens fare in the ever-changing world of cryptocurrency. Will Artificial Superintelligence Alliance’s technology-driven approach eventually win out, or will Mpeppe’s community-driven momentum continue to defy expectations? Only time will tell, but for now, Mpeppe has captured the spotlight and the bets of many analysts who see it as the next big thing in crypto.

33548756,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641861,1726254002,Artificial Intelligence Coin Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) Loses Ground After Mpeppe Spikes 100x,"In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, competition among tokens is fierce, with each striving to capture the attention and investment of the market. Recently, Mpeppe (MPEPE), a meme-based cryptocurrency, has made significant waves, overshadowing even the prominent AI-focused coin, Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET). As Mpeppe surged 100x, Artificial Superintelligence Alliance struggled to maintain its position, leading to a noticeable shift in investor sentiment. Mpeppe’s Meteoric Rise To Meme Fame Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly established itself as a formidable player in the meme coin space. Combining the viral nature of meme culture with strategic marketing and community engagement, Mpeppe has captured the imagination of both retail investors and crypto whales. The recent spike, which saw Mpeppe’s value increase by 100x, is a testament to its growing popularity and the strong belief in its long-term potential. One of the key factors driving Mpeppe’s success is its integration with online gambling platforms. By creating a utility for its token beyond mere speculation, Mpeppe has differentiated itself from other meme coins, providing real-world value that resonates with a wide audience. This approach has not only attracted a loyal following but also significant investment, pushing the coin to new heights. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) Struggles Amidst Mpeppe’s Success On the other side of the spectrum, Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET), a token known for its focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning, has faced challenges in recent months. Despite its innovative technology and potential applications in various industries, FET has struggled to maintain its market position, especially in the face of Mpeppe’s meteoric rise. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) recently enjoyed a 48% surge in just two weeks, outpacing other AI-themed coins and even major players like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, this positive momentum was not enough to compete with the explosive growth of Mpeppe. As investors shifted their focus toward the rapidly appreciating meme coin, FET experienced a cooling-off period, with its gains appearing modest in comparison. The Impact on the Market The rapid rise of Mpeppe (MPEPE) and the concurrent struggles of Artificial Superintelligence Alliance reflect a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market. Investors are increasingly drawn to tokens that offer quick returns, often driven by social media buzz and viral marketing. While this can lead to short-term gains, it also creates a volatile environment where long-term projects like FET may struggle to gain traction. However, it’s important to note that the cryptocurrency market is highly dynamic, and the fortunes of tokens can change rapidly. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, with its strong technological foundation, still holds potential for future growth, particularly as the demand for AI-driven solutions continues to rise. The token’s recent price surge and positive market sentiment suggest that FET could challenge key resistance levels, particularly the $1.5 mark, if it can maintain its momentum. Looking Ahead As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to gain momentum, it will be interesting to see how it sustains its growth and whether it can maintain its position in a highly competitive market. For Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET), the focus will likely shift towards reinforcing its value proposition and demonstrating the real-world applications of its technology to regain investor confidence. In conclusion, the recent developments between Mpeppe and Artificial Superintelligence Alliance highlight the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While Mpeppe’s 100x spike showcases the power of community and meme culture, FET’s challenges underscore the need for continuous innovation and adaptability in this fast-paced industry. As both tokens navigate their respective paths, investors will need to stay informed and agile, ready to capitalize on opportunities as they arise.

BTC bottomed last week and should rise further based on daily cycles theory, according to chartist Bob Loukas.  The Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates next week, but market participants are divided on the size of the cut.  Cryptocurrencies rallied on Friday with bitcoin {{BTC}} nearing the $60,000 level, buoyed by strong gains across the board on traditional markets.  Bitcoin tumbled some 1% to $57,600 earlier during the day after software company MicroStrategy announced the purchase of 18,300 BTC for $1.1 billion. The largest crypto quickly recovered the losses and rose sharply later in the session, up 2.2% over the past 24 hours at $59,700.  Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} reclaimed the $2,400 level, up 2.7% during the same period. Crypto analytics firm IntoTheBlock noted that Ethereum's revenues from fees rose nearly 60% in the past week as blockchain activity picked up.  The broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index advanced 2.5%, led by double-digit gains of Polygon's native crypto {{MATIC}} as Binance added spot and perpetual trading of the recently upgraded POL token.  The price action happened as U.S. stocks climbed higher, with the S&P 500 less than 1% away from its July record high a few hours before the market close. Gold continued to break record highs, hitting $2,600 per ounce for the first time ever. A decline in the U.S. dollar against major currencies supported the rally across asset classes.  Read more: Bitcoin's Dilemma: Follow Gold's Market Beating Rally or Stick With Technology Stocks?  More room to run  Bitcoin's rally may have more fuel in the tank based on the asset's daily cycles analysis, well-followed trader and analyst Bob Loukas noted. Cycles theory in technical analysis argues that prices move in waves and have certain periodicity between local peaks and troughs.  According to a chart shared on X, bitcoin likely found a local bottom below $53,000 on September 6 and is only on its 7th day in a fresh cycle. The previous daily cycle lasted over sixty days and topped on the 24th day, leaving plenty of time for BTC to make news highs before rolling over.  ""These cycles have time left should remain strong into FOMC,"" Loukas said.  Next week's key event to watch will be Wednesday's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which will most certainly mark the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut since 2020. Observers are still divided about the size of the cut, with probabilities almost evenly split between a 25 basis point and a larger, 50 bps cut, according to CME FedWatch Tool.

33547548,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24150,1726249364,What Do We Know About Fantom’s Sonic Migration?,"Fantom’s Sonic upgrade is set to significantly enhance the network’s performance by introducing a new Fantom Virtual Machine (FVM), optimised Lachesis consensus mechanism, and Carmen database storage. This upgrade will enable Fantom to process over 2,000 transactions per second (TPS) with a finality time of around one second, a substantial improvement from the current 30 TPS. Sonic also reduces storage requirements by up to 90%, making node operation more cost-efficient and accessible. Fully compatible with existing Ethereum tools and contracts, Sonic is poised to support a wide range of high-frequency Decentralised Applications (DApps) without compromising security or decentralisation. Fantom’s Sonic Migration Could be the Next Step for Next Gen DeFi Fantom’s forthcoming Sonic upgrade represents a major leap forward in the network’s performance and capabilities. Unlike the current Opera version , Sonic introduces new technological improvements designed to address limitations in transaction speed, finality, and storage efficiency. At its core, Sonic replaces Opera’s underlying framework with a new Fantom Virtual Machine (FVM) , an optimised Lachesis consensus mechanism , and Carmen database storage , which together aim to achieve over 2,000 transactions per second (TPS) with an average finality of around one second. This marks a significant enhancement from Opera, where performance is capped at 30 TPS and finality is slower. Additionally, Sonic will drastically reduce storage requirements, making it cheaper and more efficient for validators to run nodes. One of the standout features of the Sonic upgrade is the new FVM. The FVM replaces the previous Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) implementation, offering higher execution performance and improved smart contract processing. This improvement allows for faster transaction execution by bundling common instructions into “super instructions,” which streamline operations. Moreover, FVM supports caching of cryptographic hashes and jump analysis results, further enhancing execution speed and security. Notably, Sonic is fully compatible with existing EVM-based tools and contracts, meaning developers can transition smoothly to port their DApps over, without altering their codebases. Another key component of the Sonic upgrade is the Carmen database, which significantly reduces the storage burden on the network. Unlike the traditional method of offline pruning, Carmen introduces live pruning, allowing validators to continuously prune unneeded data without going offline. This innovation lowers the disk space requirements for running nodes by up to 90%, making it much more accessible for participants to contribute to network security. Validators will benefit from smaller, more cost-effective storage needs while maintaining high performance, further reinforcing Fantom’s decentralisation and efficiency. Sonic presents a more scalable, faster, and cost-efficient solution compared to Fantom’s current Opera mainnet. By improving TPS, reducing finality time, and cutting down on storage costs, Sonic is expected to enable new use cases like high-frequency DeFi platforms, blockchain gaming, and real-time oracles. Additionally, its smooth compatibility with existing EVM tools ensures that the upgrade will not disrupt the development environment, making it an evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, change for Fantom’s growing ecosystem. As the mainnet launch approaches in November/December 2024, Sonic positions Fantom to compete more effectively with high-throughput blockchains, addressing long-standing scalability challenges without sacrificing decentralisation or security. What Kind of Performance has Fantom Sonic Demonstrated on Testnet? Fantom’s Sonic migration has demonstrated impressive performance on its testnets , showcasing the next level of blockchain scalability. On the closed testnet, Sonic has achieved over 2,000 transactions per second with an average finality time of around 1.1 seconds which is a 6700% increase in performance, as noted above. This far exceeds the current performance of the Fantom Opera mainnet, which operates at approximately 30 TPS. The closed testnet focuses on pushing the limits of the network’s capabilities, simulating real-world scenarios with a mix of synthetic transactions that include native token transfers, ERC20 token operations, and complex Uniswap trades. The results demonstrate Sonic’s capacity to handle significantly higher transaction volumes while maintaining fast finality. The closed testnet has been subjected to heavy synthetic transaction loads, processing up to 175 million transactions per day without faltering. This high throughput is critical for blockchain applications that require near-instantaneous confirmations, such as DeFi, gaming, and high-frequency trading platforms. Notably, the testnet has managed to maintain stability even under such strenuous conditions, with transaction confirmation times consistently remaining around 1.1 seconds. The efficient use of gas and low finality times position Sonic to compete with, or even outperform, traditional financial networks in terms of transactional speed. Currently, Visa processes around 150 million transactions per day on average, which equates to roughly 1,700 TPS. During peak times, Visa’s network is capable of handling up to 65,000 TPS, although it typically operates well below this maximum capacity. This makes Visa one of the most high-performance payment processing networks globally. Fantom’s Sonic upgrade would put it in a position to compete with centralised payment processors like Visa, but utilising a wholly decentralised network and architecture, which until now was simply not possible. Sonic’s open testnet, which allows public interaction, has also demonstrated strong performance, albeit with a lower transaction throughput of around 130 TPS. This open environment gives developers and users the opportunity to experience the network’s enhanced speed and scalability firsthand. While synthetic transactions continue to run in the background, the open testnet offers ample capacity for real user transactions, maintaining a finality time of approximately 0.6 seconds. This responsiveness is crucial for user-facing DApps, ensuring smooth and fast interactions without the latency often experienced on other blockchain platforms. Beyond speed, Sonic has also proven its efficiency in storage and resource usage. The testnets have shown a significant reduction in storage requirements for validators, with Sonic cutting node storage needs by up to 90% compared to the Opera mainnet. This reduction not only lowers operational costs for node operators but also enhances the scalability of the network by making it more accessible for new participants. Overall, the performance metrics from the Sonic testnets highlight its readiness to deliver scalable, high-speed, and cost-efficient blockchain infrastructure when it goes live. What Kind of Benefits Could Fantom’s Sonic Migration Deliver for Web3? Fantom’s Sonic upgrade promises significant benefits for the Web3 ecosystem, particularly in the areas of scalability, speed, and cost-efficiency. Sonic aims to address one of the most critical challenges in blockchain technology, the ability to handle a high volume of transactions without compromising speed or security. For DApps and platforms that rely on frequent and rapid transactions, such as DeFi, Blockchain-based gaming, and NFT marketplaces, this enhanced scalability can significantly improve user experience by reducing latency and preventing network congestion during high-traffic periods. Another key advantage of the Sonic upgrade is its substantial reduction in storage requirements. With up to a 90% decrease in data storage needs, operating nodes and validators on the Fantom network will become far more accessible and affordable. This is crucial for Web3 projects, as lower infrastructure costs make it easier for more participants to run nodes, contributing to a more decentralised and resilient network. This reduction also benefits developers who need to store large amounts of historical data for their DApps, making it feasible to operate complex applications without being burdened by high storage costs. Sonic’s enhanced consensus mechanism, Lachesis, optimises transaction validation, improving both security and efficiency. This ensures that while the network handles more transactions at faster speeds, it also maintains a high level of security, crucial for financial applications and data-sensitive platforms in the Web3 space. By eliminating the need for sharding or additional layer-2 solutions, Sonic keeps the network architecture simpler while still achieving remarkable performance gains. This could encourage more Web3 developers to build on Fantom, knowing they can scale without needing to redesign their applications or adapt to new infrastructure layers. Sonic’s compatibility with the EVM and its ability to run Ethereum-based smart contracts seamlessly offer a major benefit for Web3 adoption. This cross-chain compatibility allows developers and users already familiar with Ethereum to transition to Fantom without needing to learn a new environment or rewrite code. As Web3 continues to expand across multiple blockchains, this kind of interoperability will be essential in enabling DApps to integrate across ecosystems, thereby boosting the overall utility and adoption of decentralised technologies. With the Sonic upgrade, Fantom is now poised to compete directly with established centralised payment infrastructures like Visa, marking a significant milestone for decentralised blockchain technology. Sonic’s ability to process over 2,000 TPS with sub-second finality positions it in the realm of traditional financial networks, which are known for their speed and reliability. This is a monumental achievement for a decentralised blockchain, as it brings blockchain performance closer to real-time payment systems, enabling applications like DeFi, Web3 payments, and DApps to scale without the latency or congestion issues that have traditionally hindered decentralised networks. Fantom’s improvement in both transaction speed and cost efficiency, coupled with its security and transparency as a blockchain, allows it to challenge the dominance of centralised payment giants, signalling a new era in blockchain-based financial infrastructure.

Should that occur, Bitcoin’s market capitalization would soar to $3.4 trillion, therefore confirming its supremacy at 57% of the total market. This kind of increase would cause knock-on consequences, drawing up other assets including Solana. Should Bitcoin reach such milestone, Solana should follow with a significant surge to $920. Solana’s market size would be shockingly $432 billion if this rise occurred, significantly higher than Ethereum’s present market worth. Solana is among the top competitors in the crypto field for the upcoming bull market according to this forecast. Although these forecasts are bold, the crypto sector has a track record of showing considerable growth. Solana had an amazing 650% rise in the last year alone; Bitcoin climbed by 125%. This historical background gives some support for Solana’s prediction of exponential price ascent in the next few years. Source: CoinCheckup Related Reading: AAVE Excites Investors With 20% Gain As Developments Roll Out Long-Term Optimism Despite Short-Term Challenges For the short term, the price forecast of Solana remains conservative. Presently, the coin is trading below predictions, and market sentiment is bearish. However, for a prediction going forward, Solana is bound to see an increased growth. In the mid-term forecast, it is estimated to grow about 116.32% in six months, while in a year’s time, the coin is expected to surge by about 50.42%.

Although the possibility for large profits connected to the rise in Bitcoin gives investors hope, the erratic crypto market calls for prudence even then.

42407646,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0ISb,1726248562,"Bitcoin Left Out as Stocks, Bonds and Gold Party on Global Monetary Easing","A global coordinated monetary ease campaign is underway  Most asset classes are on the rise as a result, but bitcoin remains under pressure  The crypto may need more than a handful of modest rate cuts before a new bull run can get started  What if bitcoin bulls were told that Western central banks had embarked on a new monetary easing campaign, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq – even with a mid-summer mini-panic – were tripping along very close to record highs, U.S. Treasury yields were falling to multi-year lows and gold was soaring to all-time levels? Is that something they might be interested in?  While it remains up in the air about whether the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark lending rate by 25 or 50 basis points next week, it's a certainty the U.S. central bank will embark on its first easing cycle since 2019. In this, the Fed will be joining other major Western central banks – the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada – all of whom have already cut interest rates, some more than once. While Japan hasn't yet joined in and in fact has made the first initial steps towards tightening, its benchmark policy rate of 0.25% is only a few basis points above zero.  The reaction in traditional markets has been as expected, with stocks, bonds and the price of gold all sharply higher as a coordinated developed market monetary easing campaign began to manifest itself.  Bitcoin {{BTC}}, though, hasn't joined in the fun. Though putting in a nice rally on Friday, the price remains below $60,000 and roughly 20% below an all-time high above $73,500 set six months ago.  Bitcoin's struggle  Zoom out, said one smart observer CoinDesk talked to, noting even with the major pullback since March, bitcoin remains higher by more than 40% year-to-date and 127% from year-ago levels. Much of bitcoin's underperformance over the past few months might be nothing more than a breather after an outsized upside move. The crypto's performance in 2024 and year-over-year remains far ahead of U.S. stocks and gold.  Still, zooming out even further might be frustrating to bulls. After all, bitcoin today is well lower than its level nearly three years ago when it touched what was then a record $69,000. Taking into account the speedy inflation in those three years, the performance looks even worse, particularly if bitcoiners would like the crypto to be known as an inflation hedge. The S&P 500 is higher by about 33% over that time frame and the barbarous relic gold is up more than 50%.  Steno Research noted that bitcoin hasn't seen a whole lot of rate cutting cycles – really just the one that started in 2019. Bitcoin, the team said, actually declined about 15% between the time of the Fed's first rate cut in August and the end of November, by which the Fed had trimmed by 75 basis points. It wasn't until the massive Covid-era monetary push in March 2020 that bitcoin finally put in a bottom and began what became a meteoric rise.  It's possible that a short, pedestrian series of rate cuts might do very little for bitcoin's price and only larger, emergency-style central bank measures will be enough to spark a new bull run.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Stephen Alpher, Krisztian Sandor",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/13/bitcoin-left-out-as-stocks-bonds-and-gold-party-on-global-monetary-easing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c6b5ec9a3181dee3cd4e93215d291f1b5e28f8b8-7952x5304.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

GoodEgg Raises 250K In 24hrs","The cryptocurrency space is buzzing with the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) integration, and three standout tokens—Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET), GoodEgg (GEGG), and Internet Computer (ICP)—are leading the charge. These tokens, which combine AI with blockchain technology, are making waves, positioning themselves as potential 100x gainers in 2025. In particular, GoodEgg (GEGG) has captured investor attention, raising an impressive $250K within just 24 hours of its presale. But how does it stack up against major players like Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) and Internet Computer (ICP)? Let’s explore their potential and what might be driving their explosive growth. GoodEgg (GEGG) — A Rising Star in AI and Cryptocurrency GoodEgg (GEGG) has rapidly emerged as one of the most promising AI-powered cryptocurrencies. Unlike most memecoins, GoodEgg goes beyond mere speculation and introduces a practical, innovative concept: an AI-driven online dating platform that utilizes blockchain to ensure security and efficiency in matching users. By raising $250K in its presale within 24 hours, GoodEgg (GEGG) has demonstrated strong investor confidence in its concept and future potential. Its AI-powered dating platform is set to revolutionize the online dating scene, and its ability to capture the imagination of both retail and institutional investors makes it a formidable player in the crypto market. With its focus on AI and real-world application, GoodEgg (GEGG) is well-positioned to join the ranks of top-performing cryptocurrencies by 2025, potentially achieving 100x gains. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) — Leading the AI Revolution As one of the most established AI cryptocurrencies, Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) continues to dominate the market with its cutting-edge AI technology. Recently, FET saw a major surge in price, jumping 30% in just three days and breaking key resistance levels. This move has caught the eye of crypto analysts who predict further growth potential for the token. Analysts point out that FET could rise to $3-$4 in the short term, with long-term projections going as high as $10-$12. This surge has been driven by strong market sentiment, with Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) showing technical patterns that indicate a bullish trend. A key indicator, the inverse head-and-shoulders formation, suggests that FET is set for significant upward movement in the coming months. Despite some mixed signals in the short term, the overall outlook for FET remains positive. Investors are keeping a close watch on its movements, especially as Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) continues to dominate the AI space, integrating advanced algorithms into blockchain applications. Internet Computer (ICP) — The Internet of Tomorrow Internet Computer (ICP) has also been gaining traction in the AI crypto world, and its recent price performance is worth noting. With a 20% gain in a short period, ICP is showing signs of a potential bull run that could see its price touch $19 in the near future. Internet Computer has positioned itself as a leader in decentralized cloud computing, aiming to provide a foundation for the next generation of decentralized internet applications. Currently trading at $8.71, ICP has garnered attention due to its growing social sentiment and bullish market momentum. Its recent performance has also sparked a rise in trading volume, further pushing the price upward. The combination of a positive market outlook and strong technical indicators, like the Money Flow Index (MFI), suggests that ICP could soon reclaim the $10 mark and beyond. Analysts predict that if the bullish momentum continues, Internet Computer (ICP) could see its price rise to $19 in the coming weeks. However, investors should keep an eye on key resistance levels and be prepared for potential corrections as the market fluctuates. Why These Three Tokens Could 100X in 2025 Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET), GoodEgg (GEGG), and Internet Computer (ICP) share a common theme: the integration of AI and blockchain technology. This combination of advanced algorithms with decentralized networks has the potential to disrupt multiple industries, from online dating to cloud computing and beyond. In 2025, AI and blockchain could reach new heights as investors and developers continue to explore their synergies. GoodEgg (GEGG)’s innovative AI dating platform, Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET)’s dominance in the AI space, and Internet Computer (ICP)’s vision for a decentralized internet all make them strong contenders for massive growth in the coming years. As these tokens continue to develop and gain investor confidence, the potential for 100x gains by 2025 seems increasingly plausible. While the crypto market remains highly volatile, the use cases and technological advancements offered by Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET), GoodEgg (GEGG, and Internet Computer (ICP) position them as key players in the AI-driven future of cryptocurrency.

While the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) has been instrumental in shaping decentralized AI frameworks, the emerging AI dating platform, GoodEgg (GEGG), is quickly gaining ground by integrating advanced AI algorithms into the dating world. Investors from the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) are starting to notice GoodEgg’s innovative use case and are now adding it to their portfolios as they diversify within the AI sector. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) — The AI Powerhouse The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) is no stranger to innovation, having brought together giants like SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol under one decentralized AI network. The alliance aims to push the boundaries of artificial general intelligence (AGI) while leveraging blockchain technology for decentralized and scalable AI solutions. A recent move by the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) has sparked excitement in the market: a proposed merger with CUDOS, a decentralized physical infrastructure network platform (DePIN). The CUDOS native token will be converted into FET tokens, expanding the alliance’s scope and bringing in new computational resources for decentralized AI services. This merger highlights the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance’s (FET) commitment to becoming a leader in AGI, and investors are watching closely as FET continues to grow. The GoodEgg (GEGG) AI Dating Revolution While FET focuses on general AI advancements, GoodEgg (GEGG) is carving out its own niche by merging artificial intelligence with dating. GoodEgg aims to provide a seamless and efficient dating experience by using AI-driven algorithms to match users based on advanced data metrics and preferences. This unique platform is not just another dating app—it uses blockchain to ensure user privacy and secure transactions, offering a decentralized experience for users looking for genuine connections. The presale of GoodEgg (GEGG) raised a whopping $250K in just 24 hours, showing significant market demand and the growing interest in AI applications beyond traditional sectors. As the platform develops, GoodEgg (GEGG) has become a favorite among Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) investors looking for promising AI projects with real-world use cases. FET’s Expansion and Collaboration with CUDOS The proposed merger between Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) and CUDOS, announced on September 11, 2024, is set to bring new computational capabilities to the alliance.

If approved by the FET and CUDOS communities in their upcoming vote, the CUDOS token will be exchanged for FET tokens at a ratio of 112.427:1, with a 5% merger fee to balance the ratio. This shift will provide more computational power to the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET), fueling its mission to lead in the decentralized AI space. The merger would further consolidate FET’s dominance in the AI sector, giving investors even more reasons to back the alliance. With the daily trading volume for CUDOS spiking by over 113%, it’s clear that the market is reacting positively to the proposal, and the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) stands to gain even more traction in the months ahead. Why GoodEgg (GEGG) is Attracting FET Investors With the AI sector rapidly evolving, many Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) investors are now looking beyond traditional AI applications to diversify their portfolios. GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a unique blend of AI and social interaction, positioning itself as a high-growth project within the memecoin ecosystem. As GEGG gears up for future listings and continues to innovate, it’s quickly becoming an attractive asset for those invested in FET and other AI-driven cryptocurrencies. The integration of artificial intelligence into the dating world may seem unconventional, but it represents a natural evolution of how AI can improve human interactions. The success of GoodEgg (GEGG)’s presale shows that investors are excited about the potential for AI in non-traditional sectors. As GEGG continues to gain momentum, FET holders see it as a complementary addition to their AI portfolios, expanding their reach into the social and personal tech spaces. Looking Ahead: FET and GEGG The growth trajectories of both Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) and GoodEgg (GEGG)highlight the diversity and innovation in the AI sector. While FET continues to strengthen its position as a leader in decentralized AI and AGI, GEGG offers a new, creative application for artificial intelligence in the dating world.

Floki (FLOKI) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) Holders Seek Alternatives Amid Market Uncertainty As the memecoin season unfolds, some Floki (FLOKI) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors are beginning to explore new opportunities. This interest comes at a time when Shiba Inu (SHIB) has faced a grim outlook from analysts, who warn that a bull run may not be coming soon for the popular memecoin. Similarly, Floki (FLOKI), while consolidating for a potential breakout, has shown some volatility in recent weeks. Crypto analyst Zack Humpries recently delivered a warning to Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders, urging them to prepare for a possible downturn. The price of SHIB has struggled to gain momentum, and a recent market event caused the token to plunge briefly before stabilizing. While Floki (FLOKI) has shown signs of strength and whale activity, some of its holders are considering diversifying into new projects, and GoodEgg (GEGG) seems to be the perfect opportunity. GoodEgg’s (GEGG) Groundbreaking A.I. Platform What sets GoodEgg (GEGG) apart from other memecoins is its innovative A.I.-powered dating platform. Unlike Floki (FLOKI) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), which have primarily focused on their memecoin status and community engagement, GoodEgg (GEGG) is building a product that integrates blockchain technology with real-world applications. The platform leverages machine learning and artificial intelligence to match users based on preferences and compatibility, creating a seamless dating experience driven by crypto. Additionally, users will be able to use GEGG tokens within the platform to tip, send gifts, and access premium services, further integrating cryptocurrency into everyday social interactions. This innovative concept has piqued the interest of Floki (FLOKI) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors, especially those looking for the next memecoin to offer both financial and functional value. Why Floki (FLOKI) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) Holders Are Joining the GoodEgg (GEGG) Movement One reason Floki (FLOKI) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders are drawn to GoodEgg (GEGG) is its presale success. Raising $250K in just 24 hours, the GoodEgg (GEGG) presale demonstrated the excitement and demand surrounding the token. Investors are flocking to GEGG because of its promising future, particularly its potential for major Tier 1 exchange listings in 2024. Moreover, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers an opportunity to hedge against losses in the memecoin market. With Shiba Inu (SHIB) facing uncertain times, some investors are moving their funds into GEGG in the hopes of catching the next memecoin surge. Floki (FLOKI), on the other hand, has a loyal following and has shown resilience in the face of market fluctuations. However, many Floki (FLOKI) holders are exploring new investments that have the potential for massive returns. GoodEgg (GEGG), with its innovative A.I. dating platform and growing community, fits the bill for those looking to diversify their portfolios and tap into the next wave of memecoin success. RCO Finance vs. GoodEgg (GEGG): The Race to the Top Another reason Floki (FLOKI) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders are gravitating towards GoodEgg (GEGG) is the recent comparison to RCO Finance (RCOF). While RCOF has gained attention for its DeFi platform and AI trading tools, many investors are choosing GoodEgg (GEGG) because of its focus on real-world applications in the dating space. Unlike RCOF, which is primarily focused on DeFi trading, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a unique use case that appeals to a broader audience. By tapping into the $5 billion online dating market, GEGG has the potential to become a household name not just in the crypto world but in everyday life as well. Tentatively Watching GoodEgg (GEGG), Floki (FLOKI), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) With GoodEgg (GEGG) gaining momentum and attracting Floki (FLOKI) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders, the future looks bright for this new memecoin. Its innovative A.I. dating platform and successful presale make it a strong contender in the world of cryptocurrency, offering real-world utility and the potential for massive returns. As the memecoin market continues to evolve, GoodEgg (GEGG) stands out as a promising investment opportunity. Whether you’re a Floki (FLOKI) holder looking for the next big project or a Shiba Inu (SHIB) investor seeking to hedge against market losses, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a unique and exciting path forward in the world of crypto.

33545531,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641825,1726246815,Mpeppe vs Floki: Memecoins Battle for Dominate Meme Cryptocurrencies,"The memecoin space has seen explosive growth in 2024, with the likes of Floki (FLOKI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) leading the charge. However, a new player is gaining attention for its innovative approach—GoodEgg (GEGG). This AI-powered dating cryptocurrency is offering something different, and investors are taking note. As Floki (FLOKI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) battle for dominance in the meme sector, GoodEgg (GEGG) is carving out its own path, especially as it leverages AI and social engagement for growth. Investors are now wondering whether GoodEgg (GEGG) could be the next big name to challenge these established memecoins. GoodEgg (GEGG)’s Unique AI Dating Approach What sets GoodEgg (GEGG) apart from traditional memecoins like Floki and Mpeppe is its unique integration of artificial intelligence within the dating industry. GEGG uses a “play-to-date” model, where users engage in dating activities while earning rewards through the GEGG token. Unlike Floki (FLOKI), which primarily relies on community hype and whale activities, or Mpeppe, which has gained traction due to its decentralized finance (DeFi) integrations, GoodEgg (GEGG) brings real-world utility into the mix by offering an innovative use case in online dating. This AI-driven dating platform could be a game-changer, providing more than just speculative value for token holders. As memecoins continue to evolve, the fusion of social interaction and AI could position GEGG as a strong competitor in the market, offering utility that goes beyond the traditional memecoin model. FLOKI’s Strong Price Action Amid Competition Meanwhile, Floki (FLOKI) continues to capture attention with its promising price action. FLOKI has shown resilience, holding key support levels and positioning itself for a potential breakout. However, despite the excitement around its price stability and whale activity, GoodEgg (GEGG)‘s novel approach presents a different kind of value proposition that could attract new investors looking for more functional applications for their tokens. With FLOKI’s market cap growing, especially with significant whale activity (with 86% of FLOKI supply controlled by large holders), many investors are keeping their eyes on the memecoin. Floki (FLOKI) has seen significant transactions, which continue to drive its market influence. But could GoodEgg (GEGG) steal the spotlight with its tangible use case in the online dating world? Mpeppe’s Rise and GEGG’s Entry Into the Scene Mpeppe (MPEPE) has also made a strong entrance in the memecoin sector, attracting attention with its focus on DeFi and online gaming. Investors are excited about Mpeppe’s unique use case, which has helped it stand out from other memecoins like Floki (FLOKI). However, GoodEgg (GEGG)’s entry into this competitive landscape has introduced a different kind of dynamic, one that blends entertainment with real-world AI-driven applications. As the memecoin space becomes more competitive, GEGG offers a different angle, combining the viral appeal of meme culture with real-world utility. This approach could differentiate GoodEgg from FLOKI and MPEPE, providing investors with both financial rewards and social engagement through its AI-powered platform. How GoodEgg (GEGG) Fits into the Future of Memecoins As Floki (FLOKI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) battle for memecoin supremacy, GoodEgg (GEGG) is stepping into the scene with a vision that goes beyond speculative trading. By merging AI technology with the world of online dating, GoodEgg is creating a unique value proposition that could appeal to a broader audience. The GEGG platform allows users to earn rewards for social interaction, creating a more engaging and practical use for the token compared to traditional memecoins that rely heavily on market hype. The memecoin market is constantly evolving, and the introduction of GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a fresh take on how cryptocurrencies can integrate with everyday life. While Floki (FLOKI) remains strong due to its large community and market activity, and Mpeppe continues to grow with its DeFi and gaming approach, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a glimpse into the future of how memecoins can become more functional and interactive. Conclusion: GEGG’s Potential to Stand Out While Floki (FLOKI) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) have established themselves in the memecoin landscape, GoodEgg (GEGG) is quickly emerging as a unique alternative that goes beyond simple speculation. With its AI-powered dating platform, GoodEgg offers both a real-world application and financial rewards, making it an appealing option for investors who are looking for more than just another meme token. As memecoin investors weigh their options, GEGG presents a fresh and exciting opportunity that could very well disrupt the space. Whether Floki (FLOKI) and Mpeppe can maintain their dominance remains to be seen, but one thing is clear—GoodEgg (GEGG) is here to make its mark.

Both tokens are making significant strides, leveraging cutting-edge AI technology to create real-world impact, and analysts are confident they could be among the next big 100x gainers. GoodEgg (GEGG) – A New Wave in AI-Driven Platforms One of the most promising new cryptocurrencies driven by artificial intelligence is GoodEgg (GEGG). This innovative project aims to revolutionize the dating industry with its AI-driven matchmaking platform. By integrating blockchain security with sophisticated AI algorithms, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a secure, transparent, and user-friendly platform for online dating. Since the announcement of its platform development, GoodEgg (GEGG) has seen substantial attention from both retail investors and institutional players. The token raised an impressive $250K in just 24 hours during its presale, signaling strong market confidence. With its unique blend of AI technology and real-world utility, GoodEgg (GEGG) is positioning itself as a key player in the fast-growing AI-cryptocurrency sector. What makes GoodEgg (GEGG) stand out is its emphasis on privacy and user security through the use of blockchain technology, making it a prime contender to revolutionize the dating industry while offering significant investment returns. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) – Dominating the AI Blockchain Sector Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) has long been a leader in the AI-crypto space, consistently delivering on its promise of decentralized AI applications. Recently, FET saw a price surge of 30% in just three days, following market optimism triggered by OpenAI’s $6.5 billion equity raise. As one of the top AI-focused cryptocurrencies, FET continues to gain momentum as its technology and applications evolve. The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) token broke through key resistance at $1.40 and is now trading near $1.85, according to analysts. This breakout signals that the token has substantial room for growth, with predictions suggesting it could reach $3 to $4 in the short term and up to $10 to $12 in the long run. With bulls in control, the recent rally has attracted significant whale activity, further driving FET’s upward momentum. FET is capitalizing on its strong AI-based foundations, focusing on decentralized applications across industries such as finance, logistics, and healthcare. With the increasing demand for AI solutions globally, Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) continues to be one of the most promising tokens in the AI and blockchain sector. Why Analysts Are Bullish on GEGG & FET Both GoodEgg (GEGG) and Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) have gained significant traction in recent months, driven by their innovative AI-driven solutions and strong community backing. Analysts are particularly optimistic about these tokens due to their real-world applications and growing market presence. For GoodEgg (GEGG), the unique focus on revolutionizing the online dating industry through AI has caught the attention of investors, especially as the demand for secure, AI-powered platforms continues to rise. With a growing community and robust market interest, GEGG is well-positioned to see exponential growth in the coming years. On the other hand, Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) continues to attract attention with its groundbreaking AI applications. The recent surge in price, coupled with whale activity, indicates that FET is on the cusp of significant gains. Analysts believe that as more industries integrate AI and blockchain technology, FET could see major price increases in the next 12 months. AI-cryptocurrency revolution: GEGG Taking Charge Both GoodEgg (GEGG) and Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) are leading the charge in the AI-cryptocurrency revolution. With GoodEgg (GEGG) breaking new ground in the AI-driven dating space and Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) continuing to dominate decentralized AI applications, these two tokens are positioned to deliver substantial returns to investors. The strong market demand for AI solutions, combined with the innovative approaches of both projects, suggests that GEGG and FET have the potential to 100x by 2025. As the AI-crypto space continues to evolve, these tokens remain at the forefront of technological advancements and are must-watch assets for investors looking to capitalize on the next wave of growth.

CEO Paulo Ardoino says the hire reinforces the company's ""commitment to responsible innovation.""  Tether hired a government-affairs veteran from PayPal and Chainalysis, Jesse Spiro, to head its own shop as the issuer of the leading {{USDT}} stablecoin has long been under a cloud of reported U.S. investigations.  Spiro comes straight from PayPal, where he spent a few years as chief of regulatory relations in its blockchain and digital-currencies arm.  ""Tether plays a significant role in the current and future development of the digital economy and U.S. dollar hegemony,"" Spiro, who also ran government affairs at blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, said in a Friday statement. ""The ever-evolving legislative and regulatory landscape will continue to require strong collaboration between the public and private sectors.""  Tether has reportedly been the subject of U.S. federal investigations, though the probes haven't yet produced any criminal or regulatory action against the company. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has openly speculated about Tether getting hit by U.S. authorities, though Tether's CEO pushed back on that vulnerability and further underlined the very public showing of aid the company has been giving to U.S. authorities pursuing criminals.  Meanwhile, some jurisdictions globally have begun to establish stablecoin regulation, but the U.S. has fallen behind as Congress can't manage to make headway on legislation that has – from time to time – flirted with bipartisan support. Republican and Democratic lawmakers have been at odds over the proper role of the Federal Reserve and state regulators in policing the tokens, which are meant to track a steady asset (generally the U.S. dollar) and provide stability in interactions with other more volatile elements of the crypto markets.  While U.S. legislation has made some progress in the Republican-majority House of Representatives, its fate is uncertain in the more reluctant Democrat-controlled Senate. The U.S. efforts have generally contemplated a highly regulated future for stablecoins, including some form of U.S. registration and oversight, which could be at odds with Tether's offshore business model.  ""Jesse’s appointment reinforces Tether’s commitment to responsible innovation and leadership in the digital asset space,"" said CEO Paolo Ardoino, in a statement.

Mpeppe (MPEPE) is gaining momentum due to its potential for skyrocketing growth, making it an attractive option for those seeking additional profits alongside Shiba Inu (SHIB). Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s ERC20 Compatibility: A Major Advantage for Investors One of the key reasons SHIB bulls are adding Mpeppe (MPEPE) to their portfolios is its status as an ERC20 token.

This compatibility makes it easy for Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors to adopt Mpeppe (MPEPE) without having to switch platforms or wallets, ensuring a smooth transition for those looking to diversify their holdings. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Maximum Supply: A Strategic Move for Scarcity With a maximum supply of 7.6 billion tokens, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is strategically positioned to capture attention in the cryptocurrency community. This limited supply creates a sense of scarcity, much like Shiba Inu (SHIB), which could drive up demand as more investors recognize Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s potential.

ETH/BTC Charts Gears Up For 180% Surge,"Crypto investors may need to start paying attention to Ethereum (ETH), as the cryptocurrency’s price could be gearing up for a major rally against Bitcoin. A crypto analyst predicts a potential 180% surge in the ETH/BTC trading pair, signaling that now might be an opportune time for investors to consider converting their BTC holdings to Ethereum. Time To Swap Bitcoin For Ethereum The price of Ethereum has been in such a significant bearish trend over the past few months that analysts have labeled it “the ultimate shitshow of this cycle.” Despite the launch of Spot Ethereum Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), the market sentiment for ETH remains low, and its price continues to fluctuate. Related Reading: XRP Price To Reach $40? Crypto Analyst Says You Should Get In Right Now Taking Ethereum’s price slump into consideration, a crypto analyst identified as ‘CryptoBullet,’ has declared that investors are now entering the final stage of the ETH/BTC bear market. As such, the analyst predicts a 180% surge for ETH/BTC, highlighting that it may be time for investors to begin swapping their Bitcoin for Ethereum to capitalize on ETH’s anticipated price rebound potentially. On September 12, the analyst took to X (formerly Twitter) to discuss his observations about the ETH/BTC trading pair on the monthly chart. CryptoBullet pointed out that the ETH/BTC monthly chart highlights a longstanding recurring trend in ETH/BTC price movements over the years. This recurring pattern is characterized by a testing phase, followed by a breakdown and accumulation period before a pump to new highs. CryptoBullet has identified this unique trend in past cycles, including between 2016 and 2017 before a major rally, again from 2018 to 2021, and now from 2022 with expectations of a strong price rebound extending into 2025. With 2022 acting as the testing phase, and 2024 marked by an accumulation and breakdown period, CryptoBullet forecasts that the price of Ethereum relative to Bitcoin could climb to $0.0885 or $0.11. This suggests that by 2025, the price of one Ethereum may be worth around $5,109 or $6,351. New Bullish Targets Unveiled For ETH ‘TopGcrypto,’ a crypto analyst on X has predicted that Ethereum could see a price increase to new levels before the end of the year. The analyst disclosed that Ethereum is currently experiencing strong price movements and approaching a key resistance trend line. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Accumulation: Whales Pull Out $4 Million From Exchanges, Can SHIB Recover? Sharing an Ethereum price chart showing its movements from July to September, TopGcrypto pointed out that the crucial resistance level is around the $3,115 price level. He indicated that if Ethereum’s price can surpass this critical trend line, it could signal a good opportunity for investors to consider going long on the cryptocurrency. According to the analyst, such a breakout could potentially drive the price of Ethereum toward new targets of $2,560, $2780, and $3,115. It’s important to note that as of writing, the price of Ethereum is trading at $2,338, according to CoinMarketCap.

42407647,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0Oxz,1726242365,DAOs Need a Vibe Check,"On July 28, 2024, the Compound community passed Proposal 289, empowering a group of five token holders to steal about $24 million from the CompoundDAO treasury. Of course the community didn’t intend to authorize a big heist. And the “Golden Boys,” the group of token holders who advanced Proposal 289, probably weren’t planning one. Proposal 289 sought to allocate 5% of the DAO’s treasury holdings for full-control by the Golden Boys in their yield-bearing vault. Many railed against the Golden Boys’ proposal as a prime example of a “governance attack,” manipulation of a DAO’s governance mechanisms with the goal of draining its treasury or consolidating control.  Whatever the Golden Boys’ intentions, how did this danger arise in Compound? Compound is one of the pioneers of decentralized token-voting, and has a Nakamoto coefficient of 17, making it more decentralized than many proof of stake networks. Yet the Golden Boys’ exploit exposes CompoundDAO’s chronic voter apathy. The Golden Boys were able to squeeze through Proposal 289 with less than 7% of the total COMP supply. That’s because many token holders simply chose not to vote — on average, only 51 out of Compound’s almost 5000 members vote on on-chain proposals. But this isn’t captured in existing metrics and notions of decentralization. That’s a big problem.  Today’s decentralization metrics  Popular metrics of decentralization today, such as the Nakamoto Coefficient or the Gini Coefficient, are token-centric. They focus on token distribution over addresses.  Consider two hypothetical DAOs, WhaleDAO and MinnowDAO. WhaleDAO has its tokens split evenly among 5 wallets. MinnowDAO, which has tokens evenly split among 100 wallets.  This isn’t captured in existing metrics and notions of decentralization. That’s a big problem  At first glance, we would assume that MinnowDAO is more decentralized than WhaleDAO. However, this conclusion doesn’t consider who controls these wallets in the first place. Suppose, for example, that in MinnowDAO, 70 of those wallets are owned by one whale, i.e., the same person or group. Then MinnowDAO would actually be more centralized than WhaleDAO, with a single person controlling 70% of the voting power.  This is exactly what happened in the case of the Golden Boys. The group’s “yes” vote of around 700k COMP was split amongst dozens of wallets, with many of the individual wallets holding less than 25k COMP. Existing, token-centric metrics of decentralization, such as the Nakamoto coefficient, would lead us to falsely conclude that this vote was decentralized, since the “yes” vote was split across multiple addresses.  Token-centric metrics miss other forms of centralization too. What if 80% of voters in a DAO have been bribed to vote for a proposal? Bribery doesn’t affect token holdings, so a token-centric metric won’t capture it. The same is true for groupthink, collusion, and other ways in which control of a DAO’s governance may fall to a single or small number of groups.  To measure decentralization in a way that matches meaningful notions of the robustness of a DAO’s governance, there’s a crying need for a new metric.  A new decentralization metric  To better understand the true degree of decentralization in a DAO, we propose a new family of metrics called Voting Bloc Entropy or VBE (pronounced “vibe”) for short. As the name suggests, VBE does not just measure token holdings in individual wallet addresses. It takes into account clusters of token holders that are exhibiting similar voting patterns. We call such a cluster a “voting bloc,” by analogy to voting blocs in political systems. Voting blocs may be loose coalitions or they may be self-identifying groups of individuals like the Golden Boys. VBE measures whether there are large, dominant voting blocs — what we regard as the key form of centralization in DAO governance.  In the case of the Golden Boys, a VBE metric would treat all the attackers’ votes as a single voting bloc, regardless of how many wallets they split their tokens into. It would also treat all of the non-participating voters in CompoundDAO as a bloc, since they too exhibit aligned behavior. Those voters, the majority by voting weight, would constitute a single, massive bloc that we call an “inactivity whale.” That huge bloc which the Golden Boys exploited — would imply low VBE and thus poor decentralization in Compound.  One of the most important benefits of a good decentralization metric is that it leads to useful, actionable guidance about how to reinforce decentralization. Our recent research enumerates a number of key lessons that VBE offers on DAO decentralization. For example, you might expect delegation to increase centralization by concentrating voting power. Surprisingly, our results show that when a DAO has a big inactivity whale, delegation can shrink the whale and lead to higher VBE, i.e., higher decentralization.  To illuminate the state of decentralization across the DAO landscape, we’ve created a new resource for the community: The IC3 VBE dashboard, which offers ways to compare VBE across DAOs (although some caution is warranted in cross-DAO comparisons) and enables DAOs to monitor fluctuations in VBE over time. As a proxy for the “health” of a DAO, VBE can help DAO operators guide governance practices.  We also believe that our research can inform the delegation process in DAOs. For example, by clustering delegates into voting blocs that resemble political parties, VBE offers token holders a way to easily identify delegates (possibly create AI agents) that can represent their interests, and in turn reducing voter apathy in DAOs.  With tools such as VBE, DAOs can better avoid governance attacks exploiting DAO voter apathy like the recent Compound case. Beyond this goal, though, by measuring and seeking to optimize their VBE, DAOs can achieve better governance that leverages a diversity of viewpoints in voting communities and fosters healthy debate. While our research is still a work in progress, we have involved major DAOs and stakeholders in implementing, testing, and iterating on an open-source library to power the dashboard and other applications of VBE.  As in so many other decentralized systems, the ""D"" in DAO is perhaps the hardest letter to get right. But maybe good vibes can help.

The purchase, the largest by the company in over three years, was disclosed in a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which took place between August 6 and September 12, 20241. MicroStrategy Now Holds 1% Of All BTC Ever Issued This purchase brings MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to around 244,800 BTC, valued at approximately $14 billion. Notably, this represents about 1% of all Bitcoin ever issued. The company acquired its Bitcoin at an aggregate purchase price of about $9.45 billion, with an average purchase price of approximately $38,585. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast: Trump Win Could Boost BTC To $125,000, Standard Chartered According to Bloomberg, the company’s latest acquisition was financed through the issuance and sale of common shares, a strategy that has been part of its broader capital allocation plan. In August, MicroStrategy conducted a 10-for-1 stock split to make its shares more accessible to investors and employees. Based in Tysons Corner, Virginia, MicroStrategy began its Bitcoin acquisition strategy in 2020 as a hedge against inflation. Co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor has been a vocal advocate for Bitcoin, viewing it as a superior store of value compared to traditional assets like cash, bonds, or gold. Despite the volatility in the cryptocurrency market, Saylor remains confident in Bitcoin’s long-term potential and continues to accumulate more digital assets. Bitcoin Price Analysis As reported by NewsBTC, Saylor revealed that he owns about $1 billion worth of BTC and has no plans to sell any of his holdings. He believes Bitcoin is a great investment for individuals, families, institutions, and even countries. However, Saylor’s belief in BTC’s potential is further reflected in his prediction that the cryptocurrency could reach a value of $13 million by 2045, based on the belief that BTC will eventually evolve to reach 7% of the world’s capital. Moreover, the company’s investments have led to a surge in MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR), which has more than doubled this year, outperforming the approximately 40% increase in the Bitcoin price over the same period.

It's only a matter of time until more CEOs catch on and understand that Bitcoin can help any company outperform its peers over the long run. MicroStrategy has performed so well over the last 4 years that the company performed a 10 to 1 stock split thanks to all of the bullish demand. MicroStrategy Overview MicroStrategy is a business software and Bitcoin development company founded in 1989 by Michael Saylor and Sanju Bansal. It's funny because MicroStrategy is headquartered in Vienna, VA, just outside of Washington, DC where I grew up. My father talked about Michael Saylor during the Dot com boom and said he was once the richest man in Washington, DC at one point! Of course, all this took place before MicroStrategy adopted a corporate Bitcoin strategy in August 2020. The company generates revenue through product licenses, subscriptions, support, and other services. However, most MSTR investors are interested in the company's Bitcoin accumulation strategy. MicroStrategy accumulates Bitcoin in 3 ways: Investing free cash flows in Bitcoin Borrowing money to buy Bitcoin Raising money through ATM offers to buy Bitcoin MicroStrategy borrowed $3.8 billion in senior secured and convertible debt to acquire more Bitcoin. In June 2024, the company issued an $800 million 2032 convertible note at an adjusted conversion price of $2,043 per share. Also, MicroStrategy raised $2 billion using an ATM market offering to buy more Bitcoin. On September 13th, 2024 , MicroStrategy tapped its ATM offering and purchased an additional 18,300 BTC for $1.1 billion at ~$60,408 per Bitcoin. The company now holds a whopping 244,800 Bitcoin and could add even more BTC since MicroStrategy still has $900 million left in its ATM offering. MicroStrategy invented the term ""BTC Yield"" to show the % change period to period of the ratio between Bitcoin holdings and assumed diluted shares. Right now, the BTC yield is 12.2%, but the company plans to bring this down to 4 to 8% over the next 3 years. Saylor and co are some of the biggest Bitcoin bulls on the planet, and the company alone owns more than 1% of Bitcoin's total supply. With so much BTC on hand, I consider MSTR the best leveraged Bitcoin play on the market right now. It's been humbling to witness how consistent MicroStrategy has been with their Bitcoin purchases. MSTR Bitcoin Accumulation Over Time (microstrategy.com) MSTR Q2 2024 Results In Q2 2024, MicroStrategy earned $111.4 million in revenue (down 7.4% YOY). Net losses were $200 million in Q2 2023, but most of that was due to digital impairment losses. Bitcoin was down 12.9% in Q2 2024, so the company lost $180.1 million because of this. The good news is that digital impairment losses are unrealized losses since MicroStrategy believes in a ""Never Sell"" Bitcoin adoption strategy. MicroStrategy purchased 12,222 Bitcoin in Q2 2024 for $805.2 million or $65,882 per coin. As of July 2024, the company holds 226,500 bitcoins at a total cost of $8.3 billion or $36,821 per coin. Q2 2024 MSTR Bitcoin Highlights (microstrategy.com) To break things down on a daily basis, MicroStrategy accumulated 135 Bitcoin on average per day in Q2 2024. That's literally 30% of the daily issued being acquired by 1 company. Are you starting to understand why so many investors are bullish on MSTR? If Bitcoin becomes the global treasury reserve asset and hits Hal Finney's $10 million BTC price prediction , then MSTR shareholders will be very happy! Understanding Crypto Bull Markets The reason I'm so bullish on MicroStrategy right now is because of the upcoming Q4 2024 crypto bull run cycle. My prediction is based on the historical 4-year Bitcoin cycle that usually starts with the Bitcoin halving event. The Bitcoin halving event is when the daily issuance of Bitcoin gets cut in half every 4 years. Satoshi Nakamoto (the anonymous founder of Bitcoin) wanted to build scarcity and value into the Bitcoin network by reducing the daily release of BTC on a predictable schedule. This is the exact opposite of the legacy financial system that prints too much money, causing inflation. Scarcity increases value, whether you are talking about Gold or rare baseball cards. Saylor understands this well, which is why MicroStrategy's massive 244,800 Bitcoin stash should garner more attention before the next crypto bull run takes into effect. Risk Factors Lower Bitcoin prices : MicroStrategy is extremely linked to Bitcoin prices because the company holds so much BTC on its balance sheet. Typically, MSTR shares will go up quicker than Bitcoin on green days and crash harder than Bitcoin on red days. That's because MSTR is a leveraged Bitcoin play to most retail and institutional investors. I don't expect Bitcoin to crash in price, but an unexpected Bitcoin crash could really tank MSTR share prices. Crypto Hackers : MicroStrategy uses Coinbase as their Bitcoin custody partner, but I always wonder what would happen if Coinbase got hacked and MicroStrategy lost their Bitcoin. This would crush the company's market cap at a record pace. The good news is that Coinbase keeps most of its Bitcoin in cold storage, but the whole FTX situation puts everyone on edge. Coinbase is publicly traded on the NASDAQ, which helps with credibility and trust. However, I always fear that Coinbase could ruin MicroStrategy's BTC stash if something were to happen inside the company. Death of Michael Saylor : Saylor has millions of followers across social media who own MSTR stock because of him. I don't want to think about it, but an untimely death of Michael Saylor would really tank MSTR stock prices. A lot of retail investors own MSTR because of him even though they don't understand how the company works. Delayed Interest Rate Cuts : Fed Chairman Jerome Powell needs to cut interest rates soon before the U.S. economy starts tanking. So many people are broke or struggling to pay bills, which means the Fed must step in and cut rates to boost economic activity. Interest rate cuts are generally bullish for stocks and crypto because high-yield investors look for returns elsewhere once the risk-free 5% yield on cash dries up. However, if Jerome Powell doesn't cut rates, then MSTR shares cannot go as high without attracting fresh capital from the sidelines. My Game Plan for MSTR I plan to load up on MSTR shares during September while prices remain depressed. September is historically the worst month for Bitcoin while October, November, December, and January have been extremely bullish months for Bitcoin over its 15-year history. Bitcoin Average Monthly Returns 2010 to 2024 (bitwiseinvestments.com) Holding MSTR shares can provide 2x to 5x returns over the next 3 to 6 months if history repeats itself. During the previous 2020 halving cycle, MSTR shares soared from $15 in September 2020 to $75 in February 2021. Data by YCharts Last cycle provided a solid 5x gain over the same 6-month period, but I'm being a bit conservative this time around. Here's a quick PT breakdown, assuming MSTR shares like the last bull run: 2x: $260 3x: $390 4x: $520 5x: $650 With a $14 billion Bitcoin stash, MicroStrategy shares will positively correlate to Bitcoin price movements. Saylor built a wide Bitcoin moat around the company that takes the focus off of day to day operations and puts it on the company's iron clad Bitcoin treasury holdings. It's possible that management does a share offering if the price of MSTR shares soars quickly. They could use that money to buy more Bitcoin during the bull market since Saylor quoted ""he would be buying the top forever"". Of course, you can buy some call options to maximize your gains. My guess is MSTR has a very strong Q4 with 3 bullish months in a row followed by a selloff in January as early MSTR investors take profits. That makes the following call option strikes dates extremely attractive to mid-term MSTR investors: October 25 $150c: These calls have a good chance of finishing ITM during the ""Uptober"" pump. Bitcoin is up around 28% historically in October, so it MSTR could close October at $167 or higher (most likely higher since MSTR moves higher during bullish Bitcoin moves). November 15 $180c: November is also historically bullish for Bitcoin with an average annual gain of 37%. If Bitcoin continues to run higher, MSTR should finish over $228 by December 1st, 2024. January 17 $200c: December and January are both historically bullish for Bitcoin, so I expect MSTR to pump well over $250. These Jan 17 calls have the potential to make bank if held long enough. I choose these options because they have the best chance of making money over the next 6 months. You can either sell the options for profit or exercise them into shares if you have enough capital. All of these call options should print before the expiration date, so load up those MSTR call options if you are bullish on Bitcoin over the next 6 months. MSTR is a better play than Bitcoin miners such as CleanSpark ( CLSK ), MARA ( MARA ), or Riot Blockchain ( RIOT ) because the company has a stronger accumulation strategy and doesn't dilute shareholders as aggressively. I also prefer MSTR over Bitcoin ETFs because you don't pay any expense ratio fees. Even just a small 0.25% can add up over 10 to 20 years if you have a long-term investment horizon. Final Thoughts What's in store for MSTR? I have no clue, but it's my current largest stock holding right now. Beware of the upcoming crypto bear market in 2026, but things should be smooth sailing over the next 3 to 6 months if history repeats. I may take some profits on my call options in January 2025 and let my shares ride.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4720992-microstrategy-buy-before-the-upcoming-crypto-bull-run?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/33543377.jpeg

Many Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders are now flocking to GoodEgg (GEGG), seeing it as a promising opportunity for massive returns. Dogecoin’s Profitability Leads the Pack When comparing memecoins, Dogecoin (DOGE) consistently ranks as the most profitable. As the original memecoin, Dogecoin (DOGE) has always set the tone for the rest of the market. Data from Santiment shows that 72% of Dogecoin (DOGE) investors are currently in profit, with only 27% holding their assets at a loss. This makes it the most profitable memecoin, ahead of its rivals. For Dogecoin (DOGE) holders, this impressive profitability has created an opportunity to explore new ventures without liquidating their entire positions. Many are now turning to GoodEgg (GEGG), which is being hailed as the next big memecoin to watch. With the added potential of Tier1 listings, investors see GoodEgg (GEGG) as a chance to replicate the gains they experienced with Dogecoin (DOGE). Shiba Inu Investors Look for the Next Big Win While Dogecoin (DOGE) investors enjoy their profits, Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders have had a more difficult time. According to Santiment, 45.42% of Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders are in profit, with 52.32% in the red. This has led many Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors to consider diversifying into other assets, particularly as the Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem faces challenges in sustaining its previous growth.

With its presale raising significant funds and the buzz surrounding its upcoming Tier1 listings, GoodEgg (GEGG) is quickly becoming a favored investment among Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders looking for the next big opportunity. Dogecoin Vs. Shiba Inu: Who’s Winning in 2024? When comparing the current state of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), it’s clear that Dogecoin (DOGE) remains the dominant player in terms of profitability. Dogecoin (DOGE)’s market value-to-realized value (MVRV) ratio for 30-day investors stands at 1.7%, meaning these short-term holders are slightly in the green. However, long-term Dogecoin (DOGE) holders, who bought their tokens over the past year, are experiencing a 21% loss, highlighting the volatile nature of the memecoin market. On the other hand, Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders are seeing more significant losses. The MVRV ratio for 30-day Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders is down by 1%, while long-term Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders are underwater by a staggering 31%. This has prompted many Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors to explore new opportunities like GoodEgg (GEGG) in search of better returns. Why GoodEgg (GEGG) is Attracting Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Investors So, what makes GoodEgg (GEGG) so attractive to both Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors?

With its innovative approach and the promise of Tier1 listings, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors an opportunity to diversify their holdings while still staying within the memecoin market. For those looking to replicate the success they’ve had with Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), GoodEgg (GEGG) represents a fresh chance for significant gains. Ultimately Memecoins Continue to Win As Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) continue to dominate the memecoin space, a new contender is emerging in the form of GoodEgg (GEGG).

33542516,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641810,1726239646,"Dogecoin Holders Find New A.I Dating Cryptocurrency To Utilize DOGE As Payment, Here’s How To Join","Dogecoin (DOGE) has always been a favorite in the world of cryptocurrencies, particularly among meme-coin enthusiasts. Known for its loyal community and often humorous origins, Dogecoin has captured the attention of investors and traders alike. Now, it’s not just about holding DOGE for fun or potential gains — it’s also about using DOGE for practical, real-world applications. Enter GoodEgg (GEGG), an AI-powered dating cryptocurrency that is set to revolutionize how DOGE holders interact in the digital dating world. Elon Musk and the DOGE Resurgence Recently, Dogecoin (DOGE) has been back in the headlines, largely due to the influence of Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. The coin surged by 5.26%, with Musk once again showing his playful support for Dogecoin. Musk’s tweets have historically had a significant impact on DOGE’s price, and his latest interactions on social media have reignited the conversation around the meme coin. Many traders are now speculating whether Musk’s continued endorsements will fuel a new Dogecoin bull run. One of Musk’s recent stunts involved a play on words, where he hinted at Dogecoin in connection with a “Department of Government Efficiency” — abbreviated as DOGE. These subtle nods have a powerful effect, as evidenced by Dogecoin’s price increase following his tweets. GoodEgg (GEGG): The New Play-To-Date Platform While Dogecoin (DOGE) enthusiasts are always on the lookout for ways to use their favorite coin, GoodEgg (GEGG) presents a unique opportunity. This AI-driven platform offers Dogecoin holders a chance to use their tokens for something fun and innovative: dating! GoodEgg allows users to participate in a “play-to-date” model where they can earn GEGG tokens while interacting with others on the platform. The integration of Dogecoin as a payment method within this ecosystem makes it even more appealing to DOGE investors. As Dogecoin holders look for new and exciting ways to utilize their tokens, GoodEgg provides a seamless solution that combines AI technology with real-world dating applications. Imagine going on a virtual date while earning GEGG tokens, all paid for with DOGE. It’s a whole new level of engagement for the Dogecoin community. Why Dogecoin Is Still a Top Choice Despite the ups and downs of the cryptocurrency market, Dogecoin (DOGE) has proven itself to be resilient. Recently, Dogecoin has shown signs of a potential bullish phase, thanks to renewed interest from major influencers like Elon Musk. According to Ali Martinez, a well-known on-chain analyst, Dogecoin’s daily chart indicates a falling wedge pattern, which typically signals an upcoming breakout. If DOGE can close above $0.10, traders could see a rally that pushes DOGE to $0.15 or higher. This technical setup has excited many Dogecoin enthusiasts, and with DOGE currently trading around $0.1025, it’s a pivotal moment for the coin. Combined with new applications like GoodEgg (GEGG), which offer practical uses for DOGE, the meme coin is showing it still has plenty of utility and growth potential. Dogecoin’s Increasing Use in the Dating World The integration of Dogecoin (DOGE) within the GoodEgg (GEGG) platform highlights a growing trend: the use of cryptocurrency in everyday applications. GoodEgg’s play-to-date model is the first of its kind to incorporate DOGE, giving users a chance to earn rewards while enjoying the dating experience. With more businesses and platforms starting to accept Dogecoin as a form of payment, it’s clear that the meme coin is becoming more than just an internet joke — it’s evolving into a functional asset. Moreover, Dogecoin’s large and loyal community plays a crucial role in driving adoption. As more DOGE holders engage with platforms like GoodEgg, it’s likely that the token’s value will continue to rise, supported by its growing real-world use cases. Elon Musk’s Influence: Dogecoin to the Moon? Elon Musk’s connection to Dogecoin (DOGE) is well-documented. From his tweets to playful references, Musk has been a key figure in keeping DOGE relevant. His latest involvement, where he jokes about leading a “Department of Government Efficiency” (D.O.G.E.), has caused a fresh wave of excitement within the Dogecoin community. Many believe that this renewed attention from Musk could help trigger another Dogecoin rally, similar to the one seen in 2021 when DOGE reached its all-time high of $0.73. While some may view Musk’s influence as a wild card, the reality is that Dogecoin benefits greatly from his support. For DOGE holders, this connection to one of the world’s most influential figures can only mean good things for the coin’s future. Conclusion As Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to make waves in the crypto world, platforms like GoodEgg (GEGG) are offering innovative ways for DOGE holders to use their tokens. With Elon Musk reigniting interest in Dogecoin and analysts predicting a potential breakout, it’s an exciting time for the DOGE community. The introduction of GoodEgg’s AI-powered dating platform, where DOGE can be used as payment, adds another layer of utility to this popular meme coin. For those looking to diversify their DOGE holdings or explore new ways to earn, GoodEgg presents an attractive opportunity. Whether you’re in it for the fun, the rewards, or the potential profits, this new play-to-date platform is a perfect match for Dogecoin enthusiasts.

33542565,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641813,1726239646,Dogecoin vs GoodEgg (GEGG): Dogecoin Give Up On DOGE 100X Dreams and Join New A.I Dating Cryptocurrency,"Dogecoin (DOGE), once the reigning meme coin, now finds itself in a struggle to retain its momentum, leaving many long-term holders reconsidering their faith in the cryptocurrency. With recent data showing dwindling returns for Dogecoin investors, a new player has emerged in the space—GoodEgg (GEGG). The unique aspect of GoodEgg is its innovative use of artificial intelligence, creating a “play-to-date” platform where users can not only find love but also earn tokens. It offers a fresh opportunity for DOGE holders who are looking for more utility in their investments. As we dive into the current state of DOGE and GEGG, the question becomes: Is it time to shift from Dogecoin and join this new trend? Meme Coins: A Market in Flux The popularity of meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe has surged in recent years, creating vibrant communities and eye-popping market fluctuations. However, the latest market trends show a stark contrast in performance between these once-promising meme coins. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu investors have experienced losses, with some analysts wondering if their days of dominance are behind them. Meanwhile, tokens like Pepe have emerged as the surprising winners in this volatile sector. Dogecoin Holders Under Pressure For many Dogecoin (DOGE) holders, the last year has been rough. According to recent analysis, those who invested in DOGE a year ago are now facing an average loss of 21%. This has caused long-term DOGE investors to question their strategies and wonder whether they should look for alternative opportunities in the cryptocurrency space. While DOGE has seen a modest 1.7% gain for short-term investors, the question of whether the meme coin can ever recapture its former glory remains. Adding to the uncertainty is Dogecoin’s limited use case. Despite its widespread recognition, DOGE has struggled to find practical applications beyond trading. This is where GoodEgg (GEGG) comes in, offering Dogecoin holders a real-world application for their tokens in a growing niche: the online dating world. The Rise of GoodEgg (GEGG) Unlike other meme coins, GoodEgg (GEGG) provides a unique utility, merging artificial intelligence with the ever-growing dating industry. As DOGE continues to stagnate, GEGG offers Dogecoin holders a new frontier to explore. The platform operates on a play-to-date model, where users can interact with one another and earn GEGG tokens while doing so. What sets GoodEgg apart from other AI-based platforms is its integration of cryptocurrency, enabling users to use DOGE as payment within the app. For many Dogecoin holders, this is a significant development—DOGE is finally being used for more than just speculative trading. Shiba Inu and Pepe Struggle While Pepe Unchained Surges The struggles facing Dogecoin are echoed by other meme coins like Shiba Inu, which has seen even steeper losses over the past year. Shiba Inu investors are facing an average loss of 31%, with little relief in sight. Meanwhile, Pepe, a more recent entry into the meme coin market, has performed better than its older counterparts. Pepe has shown a 24% gain for long-term investors, highlighting that some newer meme coins can still deliver impressive returns. Interestingly, Pepe Unchained, a new offshoot in the meme coin space, has been gaining traction. Its layer-2 blockchain promises faster transactions and lower fees, making it a strong contender in the meme coin sector. This shows that even as older coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu struggle, there are still opportunities for growth in this volatile market. Is It Time for Dogecoin Holders to Move On? For many Dogecoin (DOGE) investors, the allure of the coin has been its potential for exponential growth. However, with recent market trends indicating a slowdown, it may be time for DOGE holders to consider diversifying their portfolios. GoodEgg (GEGG) presents an exciting alternative. With its unique play-to-date model, GoodEgg provides a tangible use case that could make it more appealing to long-term Dogecoin (DOGE) holders who are looking for something new. Moreover, as Dogecoin (DOGE) struggles to regain its former momentum, GEGG is poised to take advantage of the growing interest in AI and cryptocurrency integration. This new dating platform offers Dogecoin holders a way to stay engaged with their favorite token while exploring new avenues for growth and utility. Conclusion: Dogecoin or GoodEgg? The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, and while Dogecoin (DOGE) has been a favorite among meme coin enthusiasts, its future remains uncertain. GoodEgg (GEGG), with its unique AI-driven dating platform and integrations, offers a fresh opportunity for Dogecoin holders to put their tokens to good use. As the meme coin market continues to fluctuate, those who are willing to adapt and explore new opportunities like GEGG may find themselves better positioned for future success. For now, the choice between DOGE and GEGG is clear: while Dogecoin continues to face challenges, GoodEgg offers real-world utility and a new way to earn. The 100X dreams may be fading for DOGE, but with GEGG, a new chapter in the world of meme coins and cryptocurrency could be just beginning.

Two tokens currently gaining attention are Binance Coin (BNB) and GoodEgg (GEGG), an AI-powered dating platform token. Binance whales, known for their significant influence on the market, are now taking positions in GoodEgg (GEGG), signaling confidence in the future growth of this innovative cryptocurrency. CZ’s Release: A Catalyst for Binance Coin (BNB) In an unexpected turn of events, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the founder of Binance, is set for release from prison on September 29. This has led to a renewed sense of optimism within the Binance ecosystem, especially for Binance Coin (BNB). Following the news, BNB surged by 5.95%, pushing the price to $542.19. Investors and traders are now eyeing BNB with projections suggesting a potential rally towards the $600 mark. CZ’s release has also led to speculation about his future involvement with Binance Coin (BNB). Though Richard Teng remains the current CEO, CZ’s influence on the platform’s development is undeniable. As the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) continues to expand and Binance Wallet integrates more features, the impact of CZ’s return could further bolster confidence in BNB. Binance Whales Shift Focus to GoodEgg (GEGG) While Binance Coin (BNB) enjoys renewed momentum, there is a growing shift among Binance whales towards GoodEgg (GEGG). GoodEgg is an AI-driven dating platform built on blockchain technology, offering users an opportunity to participate in a unique play-to-date model.

The Binance Smart Chain remains a key player in the blockchain space, and BNB holders are likely to benefit from CZ’s continued involvement. At the same time, GoodEgg (GEGG) is making waves as a new player in the AI-driven blockchain space, attracting attention from key market players like Binance whales. With a successful presale and a unique platform offering, GoodEgg is poised for significant growth in the coming months.

Instead, the cryptocurrency now faces a bearish extension, with its sights set on the key support level at $288. As sellers regain control, the market is on high alert, wondering if this renewed downward pressure will drive BCH even lower or if a bounce-back is still possible. This article explores Bitcoin Cash’s recent bearish extension following its failure to break above the trendline. It will analyze key technical indicators, examine the market sentiment, and assess the potential for further downside movement toward the critical $288 support level. Additionally, the article will consider whether BCH can find stability amid growing selling pressure or if a deeper decline is on the horizon. Bearish Extension In Play: Bitcoin Cash Path To The $288 Level On the 4-hour chart, BCH shows notable bearish momentum as it approaches the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The failure to overcome this critical trendline indicates that the pressure is intensifying, with sellers increasingly taking charge. This renewed downward force raises the likelihood of further declines, potentially driving the price toward the $288 support level. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart has recently dropped toward the 50% threshold. This decline suggests a waning bullish momentum and indicates that the market may be shifting towards a negative sentiment, reinforcing the potential for more declines in BCH’s price. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Go Up 680% This Week? This Analyst Believes So On the 1-day chart, BCH is exhibiting a bearish trajectory toward the $288 support level, following a rejection at the trendline. The pessimistic outlook is highlighted by the formation of two consecutive bearish candlesticks. Also, the fact that the price remains below the 100-day SMA reinforces the prevailing negative market sentiment and indicates that the downward pressure may persist, which could drive the price downward. Lastly, on the 1-day chart, the RSI signal line, which recently rose to 54%, is now testing the 50% threshold once more, suggesting that upbeat momentum may be waning and that the market could be transitioning back to a bearish phase. If the RSI falls below the 50% level, it would confirm a shift in sentiment towards selling pressure, potentially supporting the continued downward trend in BCH’s price. BCH’s New Challenge: Navigating The Bearish Path Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is facing notable downbeat pressure as it moves toward the $288 support level. Should the bearish pressure continue and the price breach this support, the crypto asset could see further declines, possibly dropping to the $211 support level and exploring additional key support zones beyond that. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Surges 15% As Coinbase Plans Futures Listing Conversely, if BCH manages to hold above the critical support level, it could signal a potential recovery and push toward the $367 resistance mark. A breakout above this level might propel the price higher, possibly testing the $457 resistance and extending to other significant resistance areas. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash was trading at approximately $329, reflecting a 2.71% decline. With a market capitalization surpassing $6.5 billion and a trading volume exceeding $158 million, BCH has seen a decrease of 2.78% in its market cap and a 23.14% drop in trading volume over the past 24 hours.

Over the last 24 hours, Shiba Inu’s burn rate has soared by more than 242%, resulting in nearly 3 million SHIB tokens being burned. This reduction in circulating supply has sparked optimism among SHIB investors, who believe the token could be gearing up for a price rally. When a cryptocurrency’s supply diminishes while demand remains constant or increases, basic economic principles suggest that prices could rise. The massive token burn rate of Shiba Inu (SHIB) gives hope to holders looking for an upward trend in the market. GoodEgg Raises $250,000 in 24 Hours—How to Join the Revolution Amid the SHIB buzz, GoodEgg (GEGG), an innovative AI-driven dating cryptocurrency, has grabbed attention by raising a staggering $250,000 in just one day. This future-focused cryptocurrency is redefining the crypto space by merging the world of online dating with blockchain technology, allowing users to participate in a revolutionary platform with real-world utility. For those who are intrigued by GoodEgg (GEGG) and want to be part of its rapid growth, the presale is still live, and it’s attracting a massive influx of early adopters. At its current price of $0.00015, GoodEgg (GEGG) is poised for massive gains as its presale tokens continue to sell fast, with more than 74% already sold. Shiba Inu’s Price Prediction—Will SHIB Reach $0.0001? While GoodEgg (GEGG) continues to raise significant funds, Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders are keeping a close eye on the token’s potential for an upcoming price rally. The increase in SHIB’s burn rate, along with ongoing ecosystem developments, has led to speculation that SHIB could make a strong push toward $0.0001 in the near future. In the past week, more than 271.05 million SHIB tokens have been burned, reducing the overall supply significantly. With demand holding steady, this reduction in circulating supply could be the catalyst needed for Shiba Inu (SHIB) to break out of its recent slump and head toward higher price targets. Lucie, an executive at Shiba Inu, recently highlighted the upcoming incorporation of knBONE into the Shibarium ecosystem. This update could provide additional utility to Shiba Inu (SHIB), further boosting its appeal to developers and investors alike. Why GoodEgg May Be a Better Bet Than SHIB Although Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to be a fan favorite, some investors are shifting their focus to GoodEgg (GEGG), which offers a unique value proposition that extends beyond traditional meme coins. The AI-driven dating platform behind GoodEgg (GEGG) has the potential to revolutionize online interactions, setting itself apart from other tokens like SHIB that rely more on market speculation. With a clear use case and a growing community of supporters, GoodEgg (GEGG) presents a compelling opportunity for those looking to get in early on a project with real-world potential. The token’s innovative “Play-2-Date” feature, which combines social interaction and gaming with cryptocurrency, could lead to substantial gains as it captures the imagination of both crypto and dating enthusiasts. Conclusion: Shiba Inu or GoodEgg—Which Should You Choose? Both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and GoodEgg (GEGG) have their merits. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is making waves with its burn rate surge and upcoming ecosystem upgrades, giving hope to those who believe the token is poised for a significant rally. However, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a fresh and innovative take on the crypto space by merging blockchain technology with online dating, presenting a unique investment opportunity. For those seeking quick gains, Shiba Inu (SHIB) could still provide short-term profits if the burn rate continues to increase and the token sees more positive developments. However, for investors with a long-term outlook, GoodEgg (GEGG) may be the better bet, thanks to its strong use case and the rapid success of its presale. As both cryptocurrencies continue to evolve, investors should consider their risk tolerance and investment goals when choosing between Shiba Inu (SHIB) and GoodEgg (GEGG). Whether you’re drawn to SHIB’s potential rally or GoodEgg (GEGG)‘s revolutionary platform, both tokens have the potential to generate significant returns in 2024 and beyond.

GoodEgg (GEGG), a futuristic A.I-driven dating platform and meme coin, has caught the attention of crypto investors by raising a staggering $250,000 within 24 hours. With Solana (SOL) poised for a bullish breakout, GoodEgg is emerging as the next big player in the crypto space, set to disrupt both the digital dating and cryptocurrency markets. Solana (SOL) Shows Strength Despite Market Challenges Solana (SOL) has long been a favorite in the blockchain world, known for its scalability and high transaction speed. Despite the broader challenges in the cryptocurrency market, Solana (SOL) has demonstrated relative strength, with investors continuing to show faith in its potential. In fact, while other major assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have faced outflows, Solana (SOL) has been the only asset to record capital inflows for two consecutive weeks, totaling $6.2 million. This uptick in investor confidence comes at a time when Solana (SOL) has seen an increase in daily active addresses, signaling strong user interest and activity. Analysts believe that this may be the calm before the storm, predicting that Solana (SOL) could experience a massive bullish run that might propel it beyond its previous all-time high. The market correction currently affecting Solana (SOL) could, in fact, be the precursor to a major surge, with investors positioning themselves for potential gains. GoodEgg (GEGG) Emerges as a Strong Contender While Solana (SOL) prepares for its next breakout, GoodEgg (GEGG) has already set its sights on the future with its innovative A.I-powered “Play-2-Date” platform. Positioned as a meme coin with real-world utility, GoodEgg (GEGG) has rapidly gained traction, raising $250,000 within 24 hours during its presale phase.

33540896,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641750,1726236029,"Solana Whales Increase SOL Investment In New A.I Dating Cryptocurrency, GEGG Play-To-Date","In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency, Solana (SOL) has emerged as a significant player, challenging the dominance of traditional payment systems like PayPal with innovations such as Solana Pay. Now, Solana whales are turning their attention to GoodEgg (GEGG), a revolutionary new AI-powered dating platform with a play-to-date model, positioning itself as a key player in the cryptocurrency space. Solana Pay’s Growth and the Whale Influence Solana (SOL) has made notable strides in the digital payment sector with Solana Pay, launched in 2022. This alternative payment solution offers faster and more cost-effective transactions compared to giants like PayPal. A significant development for Solana Pay was its integration with Shopify, opening doors to millions of merchants globally. This move put Solana on the radar of major investors, particularly Solana whales, who are now seeking additional investment opportunities in new and promising projects like GoodEgg (GEGG). These Solana whales have seen potential in GoodEgg (GEGG), a platform that is transforming the dating scene by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for more personalized matchmaking while using blockchain technology to ensure privacy and transparency. The surge of interest from Solana (SOL) investors in this project signals a major shift as they diversify their portfolios to include not just DeFi but also innovative social applications powered by cryptocurrency. GoodEgg (GEGG) Taking the Crypto Space by Storm As Solana (SOL) continues to gain traction in the DeFi world, GoodEgg (GEGG) is carving out a niche with its play-to-date model, where users interact on the dating platform while earning incentives in the form of crypto tokens. The integration of AI within the dating sector has garnered widespread attention, and GoodEgg (GEGG) has raised an impressive $250,000 in its presale, reflecting growing interest from investors looking for the next big thing in AI-based cryptocurrency projects. GoodEgg (GEGG) is more than just a dating platform—it’s an ecosystem that uses cutting-edge AI to create more meaningful and successful connections, while also rewarding users with GEGG tokens. These features have caught the eye of Solana (SOL) investors who see it as a strategic long-term investment with potential for high returns. Solana’s Bullish Rally The success of Solana Pay has many investors bullish about the future of Solana (SOL). As Solana competes with PayPal for market share, it is gaining popularity for its lower fees and faster transaction times. According to experts, if Bitcoin reaches $175,000 by 2025, as predicted by the X account “The House of Crypto,” Solana (SOL) could see its price skyrocket to $920—a 685% increase from its current price of $135. Such a bullish run for Solana (SOL) would undoubtedly have a ripple effect across the entire Solana ecosystem, benefitting projects like GoodEgg (GEGG)). With Solana whales backing innovative projects like GEGG, the platform is set to benefit from both the price surge of SOL and the growing popularity of AI-driven applications. Why Solana Investors Are Backing GoodEgg (GEGG) The backing of GoodEgg (GEGG)by Solana (SOL) investors comes as no surprise. GEGG offers an attractive blend of innovative technology and real-world applications that appeal to both seasoned investors and those looking for the next breakout project. Here’s why Solana whales are flocking to GoodEgg (GEGG): AI-Powered Innovation: GoodEgg (GEGG) uses AI to enhance the dating experience, providing users with personalized matchmaking while ensuring privacy through blockchain technology. Play-to-Date Model: GEGG allows users to engage in a fun, incentivized environment where interactions are rewarded, making the dating process both engaging and profitable for participants. Strategic Investment for Solana Whales: With Solana (SOL) positioned for significant growth, investors are looking for high-potential projects within the Solana ecosystem. GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a new frontier with its AI integration and real-world utility. Positive Market Sentiment: As the broader crypto market, led by Solana (SOL), continues to grow, the attention on GoodEgg (GEGG) is increasing. With Solana whales backing the project, GEGG is poised for exponential growth. The Future of Solana and GoodEgg The future looks bright for both Solana (SOL) and GoodEgg (GEGG). As Solana Pay continues to grow and expand its market presence, SOL investors are diversifying into high-growth sectors, including AI and social applications like GoodEgg (GEGG). With a projected price target of $920 for SOL, investors are looking ahead to 2025 and positioning themselves for the next big wave in AI-driven cryptocurrency solutions.

33540894,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641748,1726236019,Crypto Experts Explains Why New A.I Dating Cryptocurrency is Attracting Solana and ADA Whales To It’s 100X Presale,"In the fast-evolving world of cryptocurrency, projects that combine innovation with real-world applications are drawing serious attention. GoodEgg (GEGG), a new A.I-powered dating cryptocurrency, is quickly emerging as a hot presale item, capturing the interest of whales from both the Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) ecosystems. With its unique platform offering and the potential for massive growth, GoodEgg (GEGG) has already raised $250,000 in just 24 hours of its presale. Let’s dive into why whales from Solana and Cardano are flocking to this 100X opportunity. Solana Whales Flock to GoodEgg (GEGG) As Solana (SOL) continues to show strength in the blockchain world, its whale investors are diversifying their portfolios, with GoodEgg (GEGG) becoming a new focal point. Solana’s on-chain activity has recently surged, with daily active addresses tripling to a record high of 3.11 million in the past month. This uptick in activity has been driven by the rise of new projects, especially meme coins, but the addition of GoodEgg (GEGG) to the mix has garnered special interest from the Solana (SOL) community. Moreover, Solana (SOL) whales have been moving significant amounts of capital, as one notable whale recently added 34,807 SOL to their holdings, now totaling over 207,000 SOL ($29 million). These movements indicate a bullish outlook for Solana (SOL) investors, who are now looking beyond traditional blockchain applications and embracing innovative projects like GoodEgg (GEGG). Why Cardano Whales Are Joining the GEGG Bandwagon Not to be left behind, Cardano (ADA) whales are also showing increasing interest in GoodEgg (GEGG). In recent days, Cardano (ADA) has experienced an explosion in trading volume, with an 83% increase over the last 24 hours, pushing the total trading volume to $395.69 million. Much of this volume comes from major exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and OKX, where Cardano (ADA) traders are turning bullish on the asset. As Cardano (ADA) experiences this wave of heightened activity, whales are looking to diversify their holdings, and GoodEgg (GEGG) has emerged as a compelling choice. The A.I dating platform is not only a fresh and innovative concept but also comes with a presale price of $0.00021, making it an attractive buy for investors seeking high-growth potential. GEGG’s Unique Appeal So, what is it about GoodEgg (GEGG) that has these whale investors, both from Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), so excited? The answer lies in its innovative blend of A.I and social interaction, creating a platform that combines crypto with the rapidly expanding online dating industry. Users of GoodEgg (GEGG) can engage in a gamified dating experience, earning rewards, rare NFTs, and exclusive content. The project’s ability to merge A.I-driven matchmaking with blockchain technology makes it stand out in the crowded crypto space. As an additional incentive, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers significant growth potential. With a presale that has already raised $250,000 within 24 hours, the project is well on its way to achieving its funding goals, and investors see the possibility of a 100X return by 2024. The buzz surrounding the upcoming Tier 1 exchange listing only adds to the excitement, positioning GoodEgg (GEGG) as a must-have in long-term crypto portfolios. Cardano’s Price Action Signals Bullish Sentiment The growing interest from Cardano (ADA) whales in GoodEgg (GEGG) comes at a time when Cardano (ADA) itself is seeing bullish momentum. In just the past 24 hours, Cardano (ADA)’s price has surged by over 7%, now trading at $0.3595, a significant jump from previous lows. The price rebound signals shifting market sentiment, as traders look forward to Cardano (ADA) pushing past the $0.3655 resistance level to trigger a more sustained rally. Given this bullish backdrop, it’s no wonder that Cardano (ADA) investors are turning to GoodEgg (GEGG) as their next potential big win. The combination of strong market fundamentals and an innovative project like GoodEgg (GEGG) makes it an appealing choice for those looking to capitalize on the next crypto success story. GEGG Set to Draw More Whales to Their Explosive Presale As both Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) whales continue to diversify their holdings, GoodEgg (GEGG) stands out as a project with enormous potential. With its A.I-driven dating platform, innovative use of blockchain technology, and the potential for 100X returns, GoodEgg (GEGG) is becoming a must-watch presale in the crypto space.

One of the most exciting developments in the space is the rise of GoodEgg (GEGG), an A.I-powered dating platform that has caught the attention of Solana (SOL) traders and whales alike. Priced at just $0.00021 during its presale, GoodEgg (GEGG) is positioned for a Tier 1 exchange listing in 2024, with many investors eyeing its potential to 100x. Why Solana (SOL) Investors Are Flocking to GoodEgg Solana (SOL), a top contender in the cryptocurrency world, has gained a strong reputation for its scalability and speed. Recent expert analysis suggests that Solana (SOL) is on the verge of a significant price breakout. Currently trading at around $135.63, analysts predict that Solana (SOL) could surge to as high as $400, driven by strong market trends and a solid technical foundation. The support level at $120 has held firm, signaling a potential rally for Solana (SOL) in the coming months. Despite this, Solana (SOL) traders are diversifying their portfolios by investing in promising new projects like GoodEgg (GEGG). With its innovative A.I-powered dating platform, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a unique blend of social interaction and blockchain technology. The presale’s success—raising $250,000 in just 24 hours—has solidified GoodEgg (GEGG) as a project to watch closely. Solana (SOL)’s Stability Amid FTX Concerns While Solana (SOL) remains a favorite among traders, recent developments involving FTX have raised concerns in the community. FTX, one of the largest holders of Solana (SOL), recently withdrew 177,693 tokens from the Proof-of-Stake network, valued at $23.75 million. This move has sparked speculation about a potential sell-off, although Solana (SOL) prices have remained stable, currently sitting at $134.71. FTX still holds a massive 7.057 million Solana (SOL) tokens, worth $943 million, but reports suggest that a significant portion of these holdings may have already been sold through OTC (over-the-counter) transactions, keeping the public market stable for now. Investors remain cautious but optimistic, as Solana (SOL) continues to show resilience in a volatile market. GoodEgg (GEGG) Aims for Tier 1 Listing The success of GoodEgg (GEGG)‘s presale has drawn attention not just from individual investors but also from institutional players and whales. With its A.I-driven dating platform, GoodEgg (GEGG) aims to revolutionize the social interaction space by integrating blockchain technology with user engagement. The project’s roadmap includes a planned Tier 1 exchange listing in 2024, further increasing its visibility and accessibility in the market. Solana (SOL) traders, known for their keen interest in projects with real-world applications, are increasingly backing GoodEgg (GEGG) due to its potential for mass adoption. The A.I-powered dating ecosystem allows users to earn rewards while connecting with others in a gamified environment, creating a new kind of social experience that merges technology and personal interaction. Solana (SOL) Set for Rally and Long-Term Growth While Solana (SOL) traders diversify into projects like GoodEgg (GEGG)), they are still keeping a close eye on Solana (SOL)‘s long-term growth potential. According to recent market analysis, Solana (SOL) is poised for a strong bull run, with some experts predicting a price surge to $400 or even beyond in 2024. Factors such as network upgrades, institutional investments, and the potential launch of Solana ETFs could all contribute to this growth. Moreover, Solana (SOL)’s unique ability to handle large-scale applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), positions it as a key player in the broader blockchain ecosystem. As the market stabilizes and grows, Solana (SOL) is likely to remain a dominant force, with significant upside potential for investors. A Fresh Niche for a Stabilizing Market As we look ahead to 2024, both GoodEgg (GEGG) and Solana (SOL) offer exciting opportunities for investors. Solana (SOL)’s stability and potential for long-term growth make it an attractive option, while GoodEgg (GEGG) presents a fresh, innovative approach to social interaction and blockchain technology. With Solana (SOL) traders migrating to GoodEgg (GEGG) and a Tier 1 listing on the horizon, the future looks bright for both of these projects. Whether you’re a seasoned Solana (SOL) investor or new to the crypto space, keeping an eye on these developments could lead to substantial rewards in the near future.

42407653,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0PEW,1726235946,U.S. Political Prediction Markets: Why Kalshi's Court Victory Matters,"This week, Judge Jia Cobb of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of the prediction market Kalshi in its case against the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. As professionals in the space we believe Judge Cobb’s ruling could be among the most important in the history of prediction markets.  Aaron Brogan is the managing attorney of Brogan Law PLLC, where he specializes in cryptocurrency regulation and disputes. Matthew Homer is a VC investor and advisor to founders in the crypto space.  The CFTC, chaired by Rostin Benham, has taken an aggressive posture toward prediction markets. First, in January 2022, the Commission ordered the crypto-based prediction market Polymarket to pay a $1.4 million penalty and “cease offering access to trading in markets” in the United States. Next, In August 2022, the CFTC withdrew the more traditional, fiat-based prediction market PredictIt’s no-action letter — an agreement not to sue a company— in an attempt to shut down the platform.  Kalshi was next, but it had protection because it was registered legally as a regulated exchange (technically a designated contract market or DCM). Within this framework, Kalshi is entitled to self-certify “event contracts,” and the CFTC may only prohibit them where they are contrary to public interest and involve specific activities, including “war,"" “terrorism,"" and “gaming.”  In September 2023, Kalshi attempted to certify a market concerning which party would control each house of Congress. The CFTC quickly issued an order disapproving the contract and effectively prohibited Kalshi from listing event contracts based on political outcomes.  The CFTC argued that Kalshi’s political contracts involve gaming “because taking a position in the Congressional Control Contracts would be staking something of value upon the outcome of a contest of others [and] The Congressional Control Contracts are premised on the outcome of Congressional election contests.”  This week, in a memorandum opinion, Judge Cobb, a Biden appointee, disagreed, finding that “Kalshi’s congressional control contracts involve elections (and politics, congressional control, and other related topics) and not illegal activities or gaming.”  The CFTC did not accept this loss. Instead, at a hearing on Sept. 12, it argued repeatedly that this motion should be stayed pending appeal (a stay would mean that the contracts remained offline).  The CFTC argued that despite Kalshi’s win, the court should grant it a stay because “even a short listing of Plaintiff’s contracts” would cause “irreparable harm.” Late Thursday, the D.C. Circuit Appeals Court granted the CFTC a stay.  Why is the agency so worried about these contracts being listed for even a moment? The answer is that the Commission is engaged in so-called “midnight rulemaking.”  You see, perhaps recognizing the weakness of its arguments, the CFTC began hedging its bets in May — issuing a proposal to define “gaming” through its rulemaking power. In the notice, the Commission attempts to broaden the scope of gaming by defining it:  “as the staking or risking by any person of something of value upon: (i) the outcome of a contest of others; (ii) the outcome of a game involving skill or chance; (iii) the performance of one or more competitors in one or more contests or games; or (iv) any other occurrence or non-occurrence in connection with one or more contests or games.”  Agencies like the CFTC are “independent,"" meaning they do not answer directly to the President. However, the President is entitled to appoint the majority of the five commissioners from within his or her party, and it is typical for the Chair to resign when a new President takes office, as previous Chair Heath P. Tarbert did in 2021. This means that the Benham Commission became a lame duck when Biden dropped out of the election on July 21.  We know a Republican CFTC would take a less hostile stance to prediction markets than the current Commission because the current Republican Commissioners have told us so. Commissioners Summer Mersinger and Caroline Pham dissented to the Kalshi order and to the proposed rulemaking, with Commissioner Mersinger arguing “it is hard not to conclude [ ] that [the proposed rule] is motivated more by a seemingly visceral antipathy to event contracts than by reasoned analysis.” Similarly, Kamala Harris, should she win, will have an opportunity to set her own direction at the Commission.  The current CFTC knows this. If it conceded that Kalshi’s contracts are legal under the current rule, and waited for its proposed rulemaking, then the next administration could take a different stance. Instead, it is pulling every stop to prevent these contracts from ever being offered while it still can.  This is a problem. The Congressional Research Service has recognized that some consider midnight rulemaking concerning because “an outgoing administration has less political accountability compared to an administration faced with the possibility of re-election.”  There is a bright spot, though. The CFTC’s efforts may be in vain. Under Judge Cobb’s ruling, the proposed rule may not prohibit event contracts involving elections at all.  Judge Cobb found that the “a contract or transaction [only] ‘involves’ an enumerated activity if the event being offered and traded as part of that contract or transaction relates to that activity,” and the Kalshi contracts did not involve gaming. The proposed rule changes the definition of gaming to the “staking or risking of something of value on [e.g. the outcome of a contest],” but it does not change the “involve” language critical to Judge Cobb’s ruling. Because elections are not “the staking of value,” but rather the underlying contests themselves, under Judge Cobb’s rule, they are likely still outside the CFTC’s authority.  We won’t be certain until the appeals shake out, but even during “midnight rulemaking” some light may have appeared. If it turns out that Judge Cobb’s rule preempts the CFTC’s proposed rulemaking, election event contracts may now be completely legal.  We hope this marks a turning point in the regulation of these markets. In the past few years, there has been a concerning trend of some federal regulators opting to ban markets they disfavor, rather than fulfill their duty to regulate them.

With diminishing momentum and declining prices, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is struggling to maintain its position as a leading meme coin. As investors grow cautious, Shiba Inu (SHIB)’s future looks uncertain, leaving room for emerging players like Mpeppe (MPEPE) to step into the spotlight. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Rise: Gaining Traction Amidst Market Downturn While Shiba Inu (SHIB) battles the bearish trend, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has been building significant traction in the crypto community. The project has garnered strong support from Ethereum (ETH) whales, who are increasingly backing Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a promising new player in the meme coin market. This growing support highlights Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s potential to outperform its competitors, even in challenging market conditions. As Shiba Inu (SHIB) falters, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a beacon of hope for investors seeking new opportunities. Yield Farming Integration: Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Game-Changing Feature One of the key features that sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart from Shiba Inu (SHIB) is its integration of De-Fi protocols, specifically yield farming. Yield farming allows users to stake their crypto assets and earn returns, providing an additional income stream for Mpeppe (MPEPE) holders. In contrast, Shiba Inu (SHIB) lacks this innovative feature, limiting its appeal to investors looking for advanced financial opportunities within the De-Fi ecosystem. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s yield farming capabilities make it a more attractive option for those looking to grow their assets while engaging with the project. Tokenized Rewards: A New Dimension in Online Gambling Mpeppe (MPEPE) is also exploring the potential of tokenized rewards within the online gambling space. By issuing in-game tokens as rewards, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is creating a seamless integration between online gambling and De-Fi ecosystems. Players can use these tokens for liquidity provision, lending, or trading, making their gambling experience more rewarding and versatile. Shiba Inu (SHIB), on the other hand, does not offer such integration, leaving it behind in terms of innovation. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s tokenized rewards provide an additional layer of functionality that Shiba Inu (SHIB) currently lacks.. Conclusion: Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Innovation Outpaces Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) may have enjoyed its moment in the spotlight, but it is now struggling to keep pace with newer, more innovative projects like Mpeppe (MPEPE). As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to build momentum through its De-Fi integration and online gambling initiatives, it is becoming clear that Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a more dynamic and rewarding ecosystem for investors. With the support of ETH whales and a growing community, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is poised for continued success, leaving Shiba Inu (SHIB) to fight an uphill battle in the bearish market.

While meme coins often come with volatility and unpredictability, their massive returns in short time frames have made them enticing investments. Let’s explore what 10,000 tokens of each of these meme coins—Pepecoin (PEPE), Brett (BRETT), and MPEPE—could potentially be worth by 2025. 1. Pepecoin (PEPE): Can the Frog Meme Hold Its Ground? Pepecoin (PEPE), inspired by the popular internet meme Pepe the Frog, has seen impressive growth since its inception. It’s already a well-known player in the meme coin sector, backed by a loyal community. However, can 10,000 Pepecoin (PEPE) tokens really lead to substantial profits by 2025? Price Growth Potential: Community Strength: Pepecoin (PEPE) has a strong and active community, which will likely drive future pumps. Volatility Risk: While it has soared in the past, Pepecoin (PEPE) is vulnerable to market shifts, especially if investor interest wanes. What 10,000 Pepecoin (PEPE) Could Be Worth by 2025: If Pepecoin (PEPE) continues to see modest growth and maintains a stable user base, analysts predict that 10,000 Pepecoin (PEPE) tokens could potentially be worth $500–$1,500 by 2025, depending on overall market conditions. 2. BRETT: A Promising Memecoin Brett (BRETT) has emerged as a promising meme coin, often described as a hidden gem in the cryptocurrency space. Its playful branding and ability to capture the imagination of meme culture lovers have given it traction. But how far can 10,000 Brett (BRETT) tokens go? Price Growth Potential: Fresh Momentum: Brett (BRETT) benefits from being a newer entrant, attracting investors looking for the next big meme coin. Community Growth: If Brett (BRETT) can expand its community and leverage strategic partnerships, it could see substantial price increases. What 10,000 BRETT Could Be Worth by 2025: Given its recent surge and growing community, 10,000 Brett (BRETT) tokens could be worth anywhere from $1,000 to $3,000 by 2025 if it maintains its current trajectory and market demand grows. 3. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Utility-Driven Meme Unlike many meme coins, Mpeppe (MPEPE) stands out due to its utility in the gaming and sports betting industry. This gives it an edge over other meme coins by providing real-world use cases through decentralized finance (De-Fi) integration. So, how valuable could 10,000 MPEPE tokens become by 2025? Price Growth Potential: De-Fi Integration: Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s integration with De-Fi protocols allows for yield farming, liquidity mining, and decentralized governance, adding real value to the token. Gaming Utility: With its focus on gaming and sports betting, Mpeppe (MPEPE) could attract a significant user base beyond just crypto investors. Long-Term Growth: As Mpeppe (MPEPE) continues to develop its platform and partnerships, its utility could lead to a more sustained price rise compared to pure meme coins. What 10,000 MPEPE Could Be Worth by 2025: With its unique combination of meme appeal and practical use, 10,000 MPEPE tokens could be worth $2,500–$5,000 by 2025 if its ecosystem expands and gains widespread adoption. 4. Why Mpeppe (MPEPE) Has the Most Potential Mpeppe (MPEPE) stands out from PEPE and Brett (BRETT) by offering utility beyond speculative trading, focusing on gaming and De-Fi. Its unique combination of meme culture and practical application makes it a promising token. Key reasons for MPEPE’s potential success include its de-Fi functionality, its strong position in the gaming ecosystem, and its clear roadmap for future growth, ensuring it remains a valuable asset for investors. 5. Final Thoughts: Which Meme Coin Will Lead to the Biggest Gains? Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a promising contender in the meme coin market, offering a balanced opportunity for short-term gains and long-term value creation. Brett (BRETT) and Pepecoin (PEPE) still have a place, but their growth may be limited by hype rather than utility. MPEPE’s combination of meme appeal and real-world utility makes it a standout contender for success by 2025.

42407664,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0PiH,1726233354,Odds of 50 Basis Point Fed Rate Cut Next Week Jump to 45%,"A 25 basis point Fed rate cut was nearly fully priced in, but a WSJ article questioned that assumption  Odds are now nearly evenly split between a 25 basis point and 50 basis point move  Bitcoin appeared to move a bit higher on the news, but the gain was short-lived  Just 24 hours ago, it was thought to be nearly a done deal that the U.S. Federal Reserve could trim its benchmark fed funds rate by just 25 basis points when it meets next week, but the calculus has quickly changed.  After all, the employment picture, as suggested by the August jobs report last week remained robust. And inflation, as shown by this week's CPI and PPI reports, continued to remain a bit stickier than hoped.  Wall Street Journal report Nick Timiraos – occasionally referred to as ""Nikileaks"" due to his excellent sources inside the Fed – Thursday afternoon, however, published an article suggesting the decision on the size of the rate cut was still up for debate.  ""I think [it] is a close call,"" Jon Faust, previously a senior advisor to Fed Chair Jerome Powell, told Timiraos. ""You can make a very good case for 50,"" said Esther George, president of the Kansas City Federal Reserve for more than a decade until last year. She noted that the Fed moved quickly to tighten policy above the ""neutral"" rate, so it might make sense for the central bank to move just as quickly to ease.  Shortly following the article, the chances of the Fed slashing 50 basis points next week – per CME FedWatch, which tracks positions in short-term interest rate markets – jumped to more than 40% from percentages in the high teens just a few days earlier. At press time, the odds of a 50 basis point cut had risen a bit further to 45%.  The news may also have been responsible for a quick turnaround in the U.S. stock market Thursday afternoon, which closed with decent gains after sporting losses earlier in the session. Bitcoin {{BTC}} too rose to about its highest in more than a week to $58,400 (it's since slipped to $57,800).  All things being equal, easier monetary policy is generally assumed to be a good thing for risk assets, bitcoin included. But in bitcoin's current bear phase, assumptions can quickly change. At least some analysts have said the Fed moving faster with rate cuts – to the extent that it signals the bank's worry about a struggling economy – might send prices even lower.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/13/odds-of-50-basis-point-fed-rate-cut-next-week-jump-to-45,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2337aadb4f71e7a53fb8e4ec4bad5510214c6574-5760x3840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33539417,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641672,1726232422,"Get Ready For Take-Off! Shiba Inu Price To  Jump 7,350% — Analyst","Shiba Inu (SHIB) can be building up steam for a jumbo rally as TradingView analyst Krao projects a massive 7,350 % increase. He said SHIB will breach $0.001 in the next few months, representing quite a jump from where it is now. Related Reading: As Bitcoin Supply Tightens, Could A Breakout Be On The Horizon? Shiba Inu’s price projection by CoinCodex appears somewhat different for the near future despite such a bold projection. By October 13, 2024 their forecast shows a rise of 5.68%, pushing its price up $0.00001337. Since reaching its all-time high of $0.00008854 back in October 2021, SHIB has been in a multi-month downswing. Krao is still hopeful since first and foremost the meme coin has been kept under control by a declining trendline. Based on his analysis, the key trendline could start a breakout as early as January or February of 2025 that might see SHIB reach $0.001, but with the bearish sentiment still dominating the market and SHIB locked within a narrow range between $0.000005 and $0.00003, the road ahead is very much unknown. Technical Hurdles Ahead While Krao’s longer-term prediction might sound brilliant, the technical indicators suggest some near-term hurdles. Shiba Inu’s price currently finds itself caught in a symmetrical triangle on the daily chart. While this setup does often precede a breakout, one way or another, it is not clear in which direction SHIB will go. The token is currently hovering around $0.00001337 and must break resistance at $0.00001562 for any uptick momentum to be seen. If that fails, SHIB could fall toward support levels of $0.00001154 or even $0.00001028. Meanwhile, the RSI is close to the neutral line on the monthly chart and exhibits no signs of being overbought or oversold. Although this does leave much room for movement, the bearish sentiment of the market may turn out to be an entirely different story. Investors might, therefore, need to keep a watchful eye out for any signs of volatility, as SHIB’s technical setup is capable of moving either way in the near term. Shibarium Growth Sparks Optimism On the bright side, the Shiba Inu ecosystem is growing. For instance, Shibarium, its Layer 2 blockchain is nearing yet another milestone. According to Shibariumscan, on September 5 there were 34 smart contracts deployed through, just short of the three-month high of 36 set back in July. Shibarium and Shiba Eternity Update Shibarium approached a 3-month high in deployed contracts, showing strong developer activity. Shiba Eternity Build Update Highlights: •Tournaments: New leaderboards and rewards system. •Bug Fixes: Issues with freezing, loading screens,… pic.twitter.com/ekQg7gELrk — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) September 9, 2024 Updates were provided by marketing lead Lucie, who highlighted the phenomenal growth of Shibarium and milestones reached in Web3 gaming via the Shiba Eternity project. Related Reading: AAVE Excites Investors With 20% Gain As Developments Roll Out This expansion is a further reflection of the team’s commitment to building well beyond the price of the token. As it grows, Shibarium strengthens this ecosystem by providing a bedrock for future blockchain developments. Although it’s difficult to say whether or not the price will fluctuate, there is certainly some technological backing in Shiba Inu that might help it in the long term. Shiba Inu: Bearish Forecast As Shibarium develops well, the short-term prospects for SHIB look foggy. According to CoinCodex, the price is expected to slightly decrease by October 2024, which corresponds with the Fear & Greed Index score at 32 characterizing market fear.

XRP and dogecoin were notable exceptions, with XRP's increase linked to Grayscale's new fund.  Bitcoin has added more than 6% this week, putting it on track for the first weekly gain in three weeks.  However, there has been a notable decrease in transactions over $100,000, with a 33.6% drop for bitcoin and a 72.5% drop for ethereum since their peaks earlier in the year.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} and major tokens showed slight declines over the past 24 hours with few catalysts to keep a midweek rise going.  BTC, ether {{ETH}}, Solana’s SOL, BNB Chain’s BNB and Cardano’s ADA all lost just under 1%, CoinGecko data shows. XRP and memecoin dogecoin {{DOGE}} were the only major tokens solidly in the green, climbing 5% and 4.5%, respectively. The broad-based CoinDesk 20, a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market capitalization, rose 0.85%.  XRP started to rise on Thursday after investment fund Grayscale launched a professional fund that holds the token in the U.S. There was no apparent catalyst for DOGE.  Despite the lack of movement over the past 24 hours, bitcoin has risen more than 6% this week, putting it on track for its biggest one-week gain since the week ended Aug. 25, when it rose 10%.  Santiment, an on-chain analysis tool, noted earlier this week that there has been a steep drop in activity by so-called whales – or large holders of a specific cryptocurrency – over the past month. That's a sign the influential market participants are looking for a clear signal before deploying large amounts of capital.  Bitcoin transfers of over $100,000 have fallen 33.6% since a peak in March and April, Santiment said. Ether has fared worse, with a 72.5% drop, a peak in April.  “This isn't necessarily a bearish signal,” Santiment said. “Whales can be equally active during a bull or bear market. But this indicates that large key stakeholders continue to bide their time as they wait to make their next moves during times of extreme crowd greed or fear.”  “Based on sentiment patterns, a return to $70K would likely come with major crowd FOMO, and $45K would likely lead to major FUD,” the firm said.",NEUTRAL,BTC | DOGE | XRP,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/13/xrp-doge-lead-market-gains-as-bitcoin-dips-under-58k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9c3c5aa37d6e1583db3e7ab22e546bb9be69b2a2-4500x3000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The broader digital asset market has risen around 0.9%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, with XRP rallying more than 5% to lead the gains. XRP was buoyed on Thursday by digital asset manager Grayscale's launch of a trust offering exposure to the token, paving the way for a possible effort to turn it into an exchange-traded fund, as it did with its BTC and ETH products.  The market value of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) has hit $12 billion, according to research by crypto exchange Binance. Bigwigs from Wall Street, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have successfully forayed into RWAs alongside several crypto-native projects such as Securitize and Polymath. Tokenized treasury funds, digital representations of the U.S. Treasury notes, have surpassed $2.2 billion in market value, with BlackRock's BUIDL boasting nearly $520 million. With a market cap of $434 million, Franklin Templeton's FBOXX is the second-largest tokenized Treasury product. Elevated interest rates in the U.S. have catalyzed the rapid growth and leadership of the tokenized Treasuries market, according to Binance Research.  Starknet token holders voted on Friday to implement staking on the layer-2 network, a proposal that’s been in the works since July, in a landmark governance election on Snapshot's new decentralized Snapshot X platform. The vote, which went live on Tuesday, passed with overwhelming support, though only 0.08% of eligible voters took part. A full 98.94% of participants voted in favor of implementing staking, while 0.45% abstained and 0.61% voted against it. The new mechanism on Starknet means that anyone holding more than 20,000 of the project's native token, STRK, will be able to stake on the network, starting in the fourth quarter of this year.  Chart of the Day  The chart illustrates the distribution of trading activity in decentralized exchanges (DEX) over different blockchains over the past 11 months.  Arbitrum accounts for more DEX volume than Binance Smart Chain. Still, Arbitrum's ARB is down over 60% this year, while binance coin (BNB) is up 75%.

Here’s How To Join,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been at the forefront of the crypto market once again, thanks to a dramatic surge in its burn rate. Over the last 24 hours, Shiba Inu’s burn rate has soared by more than 242%, resulting in nearly 3 million SHIB tokens being burned. This reduction in circulating supply has sparked optimism among SHIB investors, who believe the token could be gearing up for a price rally. When a cryptocurrency’s supply diminishes while demand remains constant or increases, basic economic principles suggest that prices could rise. The massive token burn rate of Shiba Inu (SHIB) gives hope to holders looking for an upward trend in the market. GoodEgg Raises $250,000 in 24 Hours—How to Join the Revolution Amid the SHIB buzz, GoodEgg (GEGG), an innovative AI-driven dating cryptocurrency, has grabbed attention by raising a staggering $250,000 in just one day. This future-focused cryptocurrency is redefining the crypto space by merging the world of online dating with blockchain technology, allowing users to participate in a revolutionary platform with real-world utility. For those who are intrigued by GoodEgg (GEGG) and want to be part of its rapid growth, the presale is still live, and it’s attracting a massive influx of early adopters. At its current price of $0.00015, GoodEgg (GEGG) is poised for massive gains as its presale tokens continue to sell fast, with more than 74% already sold. Shiba Inu’s Price Prediction—Will SHIB Reach $0.0001? While GoodEgg (GEGG)) continues to raise significant funds, Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders are keeping a close eye on the token’s potential for an upcoming price rally. The increase in SHIB’s burn rate, along with ongoing ecosystem developments, has led to speculation that SHIB could make a strong push toward $0.0001 in the near future. In the past week, more than 271.05 million SHIB tokens have been burned, reducing the overall supply significantly. With demand holding steady, this reduction in circulating supply could be the catalyst needed for Shiba Inu (SHIB) to break out of its recent slump and head toward higher price targets. Lucie, an executive at Shiba Inu, recently highlighted the upcoming incorporation of knBONE into the Shibarium ecosystem. This update could provide additional utility to Shiba Inu (SHIB), further boosting its appeal to developers and investors alike. Why GoodEgg May Be a Better Bet Than SHIB Although Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to be a fan favorite, some investors are shifting their focus to GoodEgg (GEGG), which offers a unique value proposition that extends beyond traditional meme coins. The AI-driven dating platform behind GoodEgg (GEGG) has the potential to revolutionize online interactions, setting itself apart from other tokens like SHIB that rely more on market speculation. With a clear use case and a growing community of supporters, GoodEgg (GEGG) presents a compelling opportunity for those looking to get in early on a project with real-world potential. The token’s innovative “Play-2-Date” feature, which combines social interaction and gaming with cryptocurrency, could lead to substantial gains as it captures the imagination of both crypto and dating enthusiasts. Conclusion: Shiba Inu or GoodEgg—Which Should You Choose? Both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and GoodEgg (GEGG) have their merits. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is making waves with its burn rate surge and upcoming ecosystem upgrades, giving hope to those who believe the token is poised for a significant rally. However, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a fresh and innovative take on the crypto space by merging blockchain technology with online dating, presenting a unique investment opportunity. For those seeking quick gains, Shiba Inu (SHIB) could still provide short-term profits if the burn rate continues to increase and the token sees more positive developments. However, for investors with a long-term outlook, GoodEgg (GEGG) may be the better bet, thanks to its strong use case and the rapid success of its presale. As both cryptocurrencies continue to evolve, investors should consider their risk tolerance and investment goals when choosing between Shiba Inu (SHIB) and GoodEgg (GEGG) Whether you’re drawn to SHIB’s potential rally or GoodEgg (GEGG)’s revolutionary platform, both tokens have the potential to generate significant returns in 2024 and beyond.

33537906,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641734,1726228831,"DOGE,GEGG & SHIB: 3 Cryptocurrencies Positioned To Generate Major Profits In September","Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been a favorite among meme coin enthusiasts and crypto whales, thanks to its massive community and frequent endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. However, as the market evolves, new contenders like GoodEgg (GEGG) are emerging, offering unique features that could soon challenge even the giants like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Here are three reasons why Dogecoin whales are increasingly flocking to this new A.I.-powered dating cryptocurrency. Elon Musk’s Continued Influence on Dogecoin (DOGE) In the last week, Dogecoin (DOGE) saw a 4.7% rise, largely attributed to another tweet from Elon Musk. On September 12, 2024, Musk once again teased the DOGE community by posting on X (formerly Twitter) using the acronym for Dogecoin—DOGE—within a playful message about a fictitious government department. Musk’s tweet sparked excitement within the Dogecoin community, and transactions above $100,000 surged within a single day. Despite this, technical analysis suggests Dogecoin (DOGE) may face some weakness in the near term, with the Simple Moving Average (SMA) indicating the potential end of a recent uptrend. While Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to benefit from Musk’s influence, many whales are diversifying their portfolios, eyeing newer projects like GoodEgg (GEGG) that offer both high upside potential and unique real-world applications. GoodEgg (GEGG)’s Innovative Approach to Cryptocurrency One key reason GoodEgg (GEGG) is attracting Dogecoin (DOGE) whales is its unique combination of A.I. technology and social impact. Unlike most meme coins that rely solely on community hype, GEGG aims to build a broader utility through its Play-2-Date platform, which blends A.I. matchmaking with a cryptocurrency rewards system. Users can earn GEGG tokens while interacting in a virtual dating ecosystem, making the coin more than just another speculative investment. Whales understand the importance of utility in the long-term success of a cryptocurrency, and GoodEgg (GEGG) provides that in spades. Its presale is gaining massive attention, and with analysts predicting a potential 100x return, the coin is shaping up to be a strong competitor to Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) in the meme coin space. A Growing Community and Whale Participation Data shows that 70% of Dogecoin (DOGE) holders are currently in profit, with large holders (whales) controlling 62% of the coin’s supply. These whales are now starting to look at other projects to diversify their holdings, and GoodEgg (GEGG) is increasingly becoming a go-to option. With its community-driven approach and an innovative platform that appeals to both crypto enthusiasts and casual users, GoodEgg is capturing the attention of large investors. The shift from Dogecoin (DOGE) to GoodEgg (GEGG) represents a strategic move by whales looking to capitalize on the next big thing in the meme coin space. As more whales begin to accumulate GEGG, it strengthens the project’s market position, making it a formidable competitor against established players like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu. Conclusion While Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to ride the wave of Elon Musk’s endorsements and community hype, newer projects like GoodEgg (GEGG) are proving to be strong contenders in the meme coin arena. Offering a unique combination of A.I. technology, social impact, and cryptocurrency rewards, GoodEgg is positioned to attract not only small investors but also large whales looking for the next big opportunity. As the presale gains momentum, it’s clear that GoodEgg (GEGG) could soon outshine Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) in terms of both innovation and long-term growth potential.

33537904,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641726,1726228818,"Near and ICP Predicted to Reach $10, Could This AI Meme Altcoin Priced at $0.00015 Dominate First","The cryptocurrency market continues to surprise both newcomers and veterans alike, with explosive growth seen in some of the more well-established projects. However, a new contender has entered the space: GoodEgg (GEGG), an AI-driven meme coin priced at just $0.00015. While both Near Protocol (NEAR) and Internet Computer (ICP) are on their respective trajectories towards the $10 mark, investors are beginning to take notice of GoodEgg and its rapid presale success. Could this meme-powered altcoin rise to dominance before Near Protocol (NEAR) and Internet Computer (ICP)? Internet Computer (ICP) on a Bullish Path The Internet Computer (ICP) has garnered significant attention in the past few weeks with a price surge of 12%. Currently trading around $8.73, the project has shown signs of continued bullish momentum. With trading volume jumping 169% to $228 million, it’s clear that Internet Computer (ICP) is positioned for a potential breakout. The token’s price action suggests that Internet Computer (ICP) could soar beyond $10 in the coming months, as the bulls capitalize on the current market dynamics. Key indicators such as the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) show that Internet Computer is set for a bullish trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved into the overbought region, standing at 72, which confirms that there’s significant buying pressure driving this momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has also crossed into positive territory, further supporting the optimistic outlook for Internet Computer (ICP). Internet Computer (ICP)’s double-bottom pattern formed over the past few months suggests that it could push beyond the $8.87 resistance level and continue its upward trajectory. Should the bulls maintain control, the next target for Internet Computer (ICP) is $10.56, but investors should watch for a potential fallback to $7.54 if bears re-enter the market. NEAR Protocol (NEAR) Eyes a $10 Breakout Like Internet Computer, NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is also showing signs of strength in the market. Trading just above $4.02, Near Protocol (NEAR) has recently seen a 3.5% price increase, bouncing off key support levels around $3.90. Near Protocol (NEAR) has been attempting to break through its previous highs since reaching $8.82 in March, and analysts believe that it could soon test the $5 level. If Near Protocol (NEAR) manages to break above this resistance, it could target $7.8 as the next major price level, potentially rallying to $10 in the coming months. Social sentiment around Near Protocol (NEAR) remains positive, with its Weighted Sentiment indicator turning bullish. Moreover, Near Protocol (NEAR)’s trading volume has increased, signaling that there is growing market interest in the project. While some bearish indicators, such as a declining Long/Short Ratio, suggest caution, Near Protocol (NEAR)’s technical indicators, such as the MACD and Money Flow Index (MFI), continue to paint a positive picture for its price performance. However, as Near Protocol (NEAR) and Internet Computer (ICP) aim to break the $10 mark, a new player in the meme coin space is capturing the attention of investors who are searching for high-growth opportunities. GoodEgg (GEGG) – The AI-Powered Meme Coin Stealing the Spotlight GoodEgg (GEGG) is an AI-driven meme coin that combines the viral appeal of meme tokens with the transformative potential of artificial intelligence. The project is quickly gaining traction thanks to its unique “Play-2-Date” application, which leverages AI for social engagement and rewards users with GEGG tokens. Priced at just $0.00015 during its presale, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers a low-entry opportunity for investors seeking substantial returns. While Near Protocol (NEAR) and Internet Computer (ICP) are on their respective paths to $10, GoodEgg (GEGG)’s presale success indicates that it could deliver faster gains. The AI-powered nature of the project, combined with its meme culture appeal, has resonated with a wide audience of retail investors and crypto enthusiasts. This is particularly significant as meme coins have historically seen massive price movements, driven by community engagement and viral trends. As Near Protocol (NEAR) and Internet Computer (ICP) focus on their technological advancements and growing ecosystems, GoodEgg (GEGG) is building a different kind of ecosystem—one centered around entertainment, social interaction, and AI-driven rewards. This unique combination makes it a compelling option for those looking to diversify their portfolios and tap into the meme coin craze with real utility. Will GoodEgg Surpass NEAR and ICP? While NEAR Protocol and Internet Computer are established projects with strong fundamentals, GoodEgg (GEGG) is positioning itself as the next big thing in the meme coin space. Its rapid presale growth and AI integration provide it with a unique edge, especially as meme coins continue to dominate the crypto conversation. With a price of $0.00015, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers the potential for exponential returns, making it a standout project for those seeking high-growth opportunities. Whether GoodEgg (GEGG) can surpass Near Protocol (NEAR) and Internet Computer (ICP) in the short term remains to be seen, but the project’s momentum suggests that it has the potential to become a major player in the cryptocurrency space. Investors looking for the next big meme coin sensation may want to keep an eye on GoodEgg (GEGG) as it continues to attract attention and onboard new investors.

33537902,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641731,1726228817,GoodEgg: Top Analyst Explains Why Dogecoin Investors Are Flocking Into This New A.I Dating Cryptocurrency,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been a favorite among meme coin enthusiasts, especially after Elon Musk’s endorsement back in 2021. However, with the ever-evolving crypto landscape, even the most loyal Dogecoin (DOGE) investors are starting to diversify their portfolios. One new project that’s catching their eye is GoodEgg (GEGG), an A.I. dating cryptocurrency designed to combine social impact with financial gains. But what makes GEGG so attractive, especially to Dogecoin holders? Elon Musk’s Dogecoin (DOGE) Influence Remains Strong In recent crypto news, Dogecoin (DOGE) surged by 5.26% following another round of endorsements from Elon Musk. The tech mogul has been teasing his support for Dogecoin through social media, once again rallying the meme coin faithful. While the Dogecoin (DOGE) price remains volatile, with significant resistance at the $0.10 level, investors are wondering if this latest pump signals the start of a new bull run for the token. As Musk continues to play a crucial role in keeping DOGE relevant, many investors are still waiting for a more significant breakout, hoping it could return to its 2021 highs of $0.73. GoodEgg (GEGG): A Fresh Opportunity for Dogecoin Holders At the same time, a new contender has emerged in the crypto world: GoodEgg (GEGG). This A.I. dating cryptocurrency has intrigued Dogecoin (DOGE) holders, not just for its innovative concept but also for its potential financial returns. With the presale currently live at a price of $0.00015 per GEGG token, early investors are expecting significant gains, with analysts predicting a potential 100x return. GoodEgg sets itself apart by combining blockchain technology with a social platform aimed at enhancing user connections and fostering real-world impact through its Play-2-Date ecosystem. GoodEgg (GEGG) Gaining Popularity Dogecoin (DOGE) may have its appeal rooted in meme culture and celebrity endorsement, but GoodEgg (GEGG) offers something more tangible—an actual use case. With its AI-driven platform, GEGG allows users to earn tokens through their engagement, making the project more than just another meme coin. The platform’s dating and social scoring features add a layer of utility that most meme coins lack, making it an appealing option for Dogecoin (DOGE) investors looking for more diversified opportunities. Dogecoin’s Market Struggles Despite its recent surge, Dogecoin (DOGE) is facing some significant challenges. The Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA) of DOGE, a key indicator that measures the average age of invested funds, has shown a downward trend. This suggests that more investors are selling their DOGE holdings rather than holding onto them long-term. Additionally, the ratio of new wallets to closed wallets is shrinking, indicating a decline in new users entering the Dogecoin (DOGE) ecosystem. With DOGE currently facing resistance at the $0.10 level, analysts warn that if this barrier isn’t breached soon, the token could fall to $0.091, signaling a potential downturn for short-term investors. However, if the bulls regain control, there’s hope that DOGE could climb back up to $0.12. GoodEgg’s Competitive Edge For Dogecoin (DOGE) holders looking for the next big thing, GoodEgg (GEGG) presents a compelling alternative. Its presale is already showing strong interest, and the combination of A.I. technology and social impact positions it well for long-term growth. Unlike DOGE, which relies heavily on speculative market movements, GoodEgg (GEGG) offers real-world utility, giving it a more stable foundation for future success. Can DOGE Hold Off New Meme Challenger? While Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to benefit from Elon Musk’s influence, its long-term prospects remain uncertain. The token faces considerable resistance, and many investors are seeking more reliable opportunities.

33537960,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641736,1726228814,Shiba Inu and GoodEgg: Two Cryptocurrencies Positioned To OverTake Dogecoin In 2025,"In the world of cryptocurrency, the 2021 bull run stands as a key event, where both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) soared, turning modest investments into massive fortunes. Investors who held just $1,000 in Shiba Inu (SHIB) or Dogecoin (DOGE) became millionaires, as these meme coins skyrocketed in value, thanks to community support and influencer hype, notably from figures like Elon Musk. Now, as the crypto market eyes its next major rally, the question on many investors’ minds is: which cryptocurrencies will mirror the success of Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) in 2025? GoodEgg (GEGG), a rising star with a unique approach, could very well be the answer. GoodEgg (GEGG): A New Player in the Field While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have maintained their popularity in the meme coin space, GoodEgg (GEGG) is emerging as a contender that offers more than just community hype. Combining artificial intelligence with the social-fi movement, GoodEgg (GEGG) stands out by providing an actual product—a dating platform that leverages cryptocurrency for real-world interactions. This social dating platform, built on blockchain technology, allows users to earn GEGG tokens while interacting with others, offering both a fun and financially rewarding experience. As of now, GoodEgg (GEGG) is priced attractively at $0.00015, making it an accessible option for those looking to get in early on a project with the potential for explosive growth. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Its Continuing Journey Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to ride on the success of its 2021 rally. With strong community backing and a growing number of use cases in DeFi and NFTs, Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains a top pick for many investors. On the technical side, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has found support around $0.00001267 and is attempting to break resistance at $0.00001697. Should it succeed, it could regain the momentum it had during its peak in 2021. However, Shiba Inu (SHIB) faces challenges in distinguishing itself beyond the meme coin label. Although there are ongoing efforts to expand its utility, its competitors, such as GoodEgg (GEGG), are offering innovative real-world applications that could put pressure on Shiba Inu (SHIB) in the long run. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Original Meme Coin Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme cryptocurrency, also continues to enjoy immense popularity. With Elon Musk’s frequent tweets and the strong community behind it, Dogecoin (DOGE) remains a top contender in the meme coin space. In recent news, whales have been accumulating Dogecoin (DOGE), signaling bullish sentiment. Over 400 million Dogecoin (DOGE) tokens were purchased by large holders, and on-chain signals look promising for the token’s near future. Despite this, Dogecoin (DOGE) is still down from its all-time high of $0.73 in May 2021. While it remains an iconic cryptocurrency, many investors are beginning to look for alternatives like GoodEgg (GEGG) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), which offer new and exciting opportunities in the ever-evolving crypto space. The Race for 2025: Who Will Lead? As we look towards 2025, the race is on to see which cryptocurrencies will capture the public’s imagination and deliver the kind of returns seen with Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) in 2021. GoodEgg (GEGG), with its unique AI-powered dating platform, offers a fresh angle that could attract both new and seasoned crypto investors. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is working to expand its ecosystem with DeFi applications, while Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to ride the wave of community support and high-profile endorsements. The Future of Meme Coins and Beyond Both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have proven that meme coins can generate life-changing returns for early investors. However, as the market matures, tokens like GoodEgg (GEGG), which offer real-world use cases and innovative solutions, are likely to capture the interest of the next generation of crypto investors. For those looking to position themselves for the next bull run in 2025, Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and GoodEgg (GEGG) are all worth keeping an eye on. While meme coins will always have their place, projects like GoodEgg (GEGG) that push the boundaries of technology and community interaction may just be the future of the cryptocurrency market.

Hash price continues to make new lows. WGMI is an actively managed ETF that aims to offer investors broad exposure to the Bitcoin mining industry. The fund has high turnover and concentration compared with other crypto-equity ETFs. Top ten holdings appear to skew more to mining stocks that are working on growth in HPC data center segments rather than just BTC mining pure plays. With Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) having gone virtually nowhere for six months and mining stocks struggling since July, it's potentially a good time to find the right BTC proxy plays before any potential seasonal bump in both the coin and crypto-related equities between now and the end of the year. In past cycles, we've seen miners generally offer serious alpha when Bitcoin is going parabolic. Of course, this time may very well be different due to the existence of spot ETFs in the United States. Such products figure to compete with mining companies for investment capital. Year To Date Performance Since the beginning of the year, the price of Bitcoin is up just under 36%. Prior to spot ETF conversion, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) was one of the more straightforward ways to gain exposure to any rally in BTC. Those shares have performed nearly as well. The miners have been much less convincing: Data by YCharts The Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF ( WGMI ) is actually down 6% year to date. It trails BTC, GBTC, and other Bitcoin-proxy plays like MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) to a significant degree. In this article, we'll go over the state of the sector and mining economics. We'll look at the top holdings in the fund. And we'll compare WGMI to two other crypto-equity ETFs from which investors may choose. Mining Sector Health As of mid-September, we are approaching a fifth full month since the block reward halving in April. To summarize, BTC is a fixed-supply cryptocurrency that is mined through proof-of-work consensus. For the cost of validating ledger transactions with electricity and equipment, the miners are paid in BTC. In the future, this BTC incentive will have to come primarily from transaction fees. Currently, new token issuance is the primary driver of mining revenue. However, since the BTC supply is fixed, new token issuance can't mathematically continue forever. Miner Revenue (Bitcoin Magazine PRO) Every four years, we see the mining reward from new token issuance drop by 50%. The most recent example of this was April 2024. The impact of these events are substantial. So long as the price of BTC remains the same - and it's actually down since the halving - miners see their cost of revenue essentially double if they want to produce the same amount of BTC post-halving. Thus, many miners try to 'scale their way out' of declining BTC rewards, and the impact of that has been an explosion in global hash rate: Data by YCharts Paradoxically, the more difficult it has become to generate BTC-denominated rewards from mining Bitcoin, the more we've seen machines continue to be turned on to compete for those dwindling rewards. Obviously, this is due to the USD-denominated value of the BTC generally increasing over time. Yet, despite the rise in USD price of BTC, the USD revenue generated from compute is currently at an all-time low: USD Hashprice (Hashrate index) The chart above is showing the five-year trend in price per PH/s from Bitcoin mining. In early September, that price fell below $40 PH/s per day. This is not a great sign if you're bullish on Bitcoin miners, and speaks to the recent consolidation moves we've seen from companies like CleanSpark ( CLSK ). Peers & Holdings As far as I am aware, WGMI is the only ETF that is specifically structured to provide investors exposure to the Bitcoin mining industry. However, there are additional funds that have both a similar AUM to WGMI and similar holdings in Bitcoin mining stocks. Those funds are the Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF ( FDIG ) and the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF ( BITQ ). For the sake of comparison, we'll use each of these funds as WGMI peers. WGMI FDIG BITQ Inception 02/07/2022 04/19/2022 04/27/2021 Expense Ratio 0.75% 0.39% 0.85% AUM $114.5 $91.0 $115.5 Dividend Yield (TTM) 0.33% - 1.47% YTD Price Performance -5.56% -8.11% 3.28% Source: Seeking Alpha, $ in millions All three of these funds are actively managed with expense ratios that aren't what I'd call overly problematic given the turnover. WGMI has underperformed both the market and BITQ year to date. In my view, the biggest difference between the funds is holder concentration: WGMI FDIG BITQ Number of Holdings 21 39 35 Assets in Top 10 76.4% 51.7% 58.6% Turnover 74% 53% 61% Source: Seeking Alpha 76.4% of WGMI is allocated to the top 10 positions, and there are just 21 stocks in the fund. This is well below FDIG and BITQ. From a top 10 holdings standpoint, I actually don't hate the approach to portfolio construction that I'm seeing, given the mining economic issues I mentioned above: WGMI Top 10 (Seeking Alpha) I find these allocations to be quite interesting and indicative of fund management that appears to be thinking through the future of the industry. At least five of the top seven companies in the fund are openly trying to build an HPC/AI compute segment in addition to BTC mining. Furthermore, the top company in the industry by market capitalization is only the 8th largest holding in the fund. Thus, it would appear that a bet on WGMI is becoming just as much of a play on HPC data centers as it is Bitcoin miners. Closing Thoughts In this article, I've made the case for why I believe the Bitcoin mining space is facing a deteriorating economics. Thus, it is not a surprise to see most mining stocks and WGMI down year to date, even as Bitcoin and other Bitcoin-proxies have performed quite well in 2024. As I see it, there are a handful of ways out of this for Bitcoin miners; the price of BTC either has to rise exponentially, again, global exahash has to come down as the weaker miners throw in the towel, transaction fees need to take the place of supply issuance as the primary mining incentive, or the companies need to simply pivot to something else like AI/HPC I suspect almost everyone in this space is banking on number 1 coming to fruition to some degree. And we're clearly seeing efforts for number 4. In my view, number 3 is unlikely given the declining usage seen through daily active addresses on the chain. That leaves number 2 as the most realistic path forward for the industry leaders who don't pivot to other businesses. There are questions then for each individual investor to consider. Should investors buy WGMI and simply endure the possibility that some, or even many, of the companies in the ETF may fail long term? Should investors try to pick survivors individually? Or should we be staying away from the sector entirely? I won't be presumptuous enough to answer that for you, as each reader may have a different strategy and pain tolerance. But I will say I don't think WGMI is the right way to play Bitcoin as a long-term investment.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4720918-wgmi-top-ten-holdings-tell-the-tale?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/33537941.jpeg

The market, which has seen over $1.7 million in bets, will only resolve to ""Yes"" if Trump personally issues a verifiable token on a blockchain by November 4, 2024, despite plans for a governance token named ""WLFI"" in the project's white paper.  Betting odds on Republican candidate Donald Trump issuing a token before the November presidential elections jumped to over 84% on Polymarket early Friday, before reversing, as he confirmed a launch date for the Trump family-helmed World Liberty Financial crypto project.  The odds of a “yes” in the “Will Trump launch a coin before the election?” market were just 40% on Thursday and 16% a month ago. That seemingly changed in the past 12 hours as Trump said the World Liberty Financial project will released on Monday.  The market has attracted over $1.7 million in bets by Polymarket users as of Friday. It will resolve to ""Yes"" if conclusive evidence emerges that Trump is involved in “deploying a new token” by November 4, 2024, 11:59 PM ET.  That means mere plans or confirmation for the token will not resolve the market to “Yes:” it will have to be an actual token issued on a blockchain in a way that can be verified by all.  A copy of the World Liberty white paper seen by CoinDesk states plans for the project to issue a non-transferable governance token called “WLFI.” However, it remains unknown what specific part Trump plays in the project and his role in issuing the proposed token.  Still, some Polymarket users are taking their chances.  “The development team already launched multiple test tokens on Ethereum,” user “Car,” who holds over 4,400 yes shares, wrote. “Funnily enough, that's enough to resolve this market to YES.”  “Non-fungible tokens are indeed Tokens,” another user, “563defi,” who holds 6,600 yes shares, said, referring to Trump’s lineup of NFT projects.  Those on the other side of the bet remain skeptical: “Even if a token launches, it will be his son's,” user “Tenebrus7,” who holds 2,000 “No” shares, wrote. “After the scam - trump will not want to be associated with it anytime soon.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/09/13/polymarket-bettors-see-84-chance-of-donald-trump-starting-his-own-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fbf25bec2220f16365287df226ab3e12393c4de2-5184x2916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The ruling comes as the government proposes a new classification of property that would specifically cover cryptocurrencies.  The High Court of Justice for England and Wales said Tether's USDT stablecoin, the largest by market cap, can be considered property in a ruling one day after the U.K. government started legislating on the status of cryptocurrencies.  ""USDT attract property rights under English law, "" Richard Farnhill, a deputy high court judge, said in the court filing on Thursday. ""It can be the subject of tracing and can constitute trust property in the same way as other property.""  The case was brought by Fabrizio D’Aloia, who said he was the victim of a cryptocurrency scam, and relates mainly to crypto exchange Bitkub, named as one of seven defendants including two unidentified people and Binance, the largest crypto exchange by volume traded. The case against Binance was settled, according to the filing.  D’Aloia claimed he was induced to hand over cryptocurrency in the form of USDT and Circle's USDC totaling around 2.5 million pounds ($3.3 million) by an unidentified defendant. The alleged scammer passed the funds through various blockchain wallets before it was withdrawn by the other unidentified defendent as fiat currency through Gate and Bitkub.  On Wednesday the government introduced a bill paving the way for crypto to be treated like property. The bill, drafted by independent statutory body the Law Commission, had its first reading in Parliament. Farnhill's ruling echoes the bill's assertion that crypto is neither a thing ""in possession,” which covers items such as money and cars, nor a thing “in action,” such as debt and shares, but is property nevertheless.  Still, the judge concluded in favor of Bitkub, saying D’Aloia has no claim against the company because ""it did not receive anything from him.""  D’Aloia's claim against crypto trading platform Aux Cayes Fintech was ""struck out,"" the court document said.

42407660,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0PBD,1726227634,Tokenized Real-World Assets (Excluding Stablecoins) Market Value Hits Over $12B: Binance Research,"RWAs continue to experience growth led by tokenized U.S. Treasuries.  BlackRock's boasts a market value of over $500 million.  The market value of on-chain real-world assets (RWAs), excluding stablecoins, continues to rise, representing continued investor interest in blockchain-based tokenization of traditional assets.  Currently, total RWAs are worth more than a record $12 billion, according to a report published by Binance Research on Friday. That amount excludes the $175 billion stablecoin market.  Tokenization of RWAs like real estate, government bonds, stocks, and intangible assets like carbon credits makes traditionally illiquid markets easier to trade, allowing investors to purchase assets in fractions while facilitating clear records and streamlining the settlement process.  For over a year, tokenization has been touted as a trillion-dollar opportunity, accelerating traditional finance's transition to blockchain rails. Bigwigs from Wall Street, like BlackRock (BLK) and Fidelity, have successfully forayed into RWAs alongside several crypto-native projects such as Securitize and Polymath.  Tokenized treasury funds, digital representations of the U.S. Treasury notes, have surpassed $2.2 billion in market value, with BlackRock's BUILD boasting nearly $520 million. With a market cap of $434 million, Franklin Templeton's FBOXX is the second-largest tokenized Treasury product.  Elevated interest rates in the U.S. have catalyzed the rapid growth and leadership of the tokenized Treasuries market, according to Binance Research.  ""This growth has likely been impacted by U.S. interest rates being at a 23-year high, with the federal funds target rate having been held steady at 5.25%-5.5% since July 2023. This has made the US government-backed yield of Treasuries an attractive investment vehicle for many investors,"" analysts at Binance Research said in the report.  The Federal Reserve, however, is expected to cut rates in the coming months, potentially denting the appeal of yield-bearing instruments, including tokenized Treasuries. The central bank is likely to announced the first rate cut next week.  Per Binance Research, sizeable rate reductions may be needed to weaken the demand for tokenized Treasuries materially.  ""With rates so high at the moment, the size and regularity of any cuts will be crucial. As things stand, the major tokenized Treasury products yield between 4.5%-5.5%, thus it will take quite a few cuts before these yields become uncompetitive,"" analysts noted.  Binance Research also took stock of on-chain private credit, tokenized commodities and real estate. The report said the on-chain credit market is worth $9 billion or just 0.4% of the traditional private credit market sized at $2.1 trillion in 2023.  Besides, Figure, a fintech company providing lines of credit collateralized by home equity, accounted for most of the market value of the on-chain private credit market. However, excluding Figure, the sub-sector has still experienced growth in terms of active loans, led by Centrifuge, Maple, and Goldfinch.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | RESEARCH | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/13/tokenized-real-world-assets-excluding-stablecoins-market-value-hits-over-12b-binance-research,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f921937d7bb27000736b40dac2f500f53aeef4d8-1234x736.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33537174,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641656,1726227038,XRP Price To Crash To $0.33 Before Surge To $9 Post-SEC Appeal; Analyst Reveals,"Earlier in August, the XRP community got some positive news when the court ruled that Ripple Labs should pay a $125 million fine to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for selling unregistered securities. However, the regulator has been unhappy with this decision, leading to an appeal of the court’s decision. Naturally, the appeal has pushed back the finish line for the 4-year battle, but the end could still be very bullish for the XRP price. The XRP Crash Before The Surge While the SEC and Ripple continue to battle it out in court, a pseudonymous crypto analyst on the TradingView website who goes by the name AnalysisParalysis has shared their expectation for the XRP price. In this case, the crypto analyst expects that the altcoin’s price will rally. But not without first suffering a decline due to the SEC appeal. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forms Golden Cross On 2-Month Chart, Here’s What Happened Last Time According to the analyst, the SEC appeal is expected to come sometime before October 6, 2024, during which time they expect the XRP price to struggle. “I believe this will be the catalyst this time around that causes XRP to crash just before its going to go on a massive upward movement,” the analyst said. The initial crash here is expected to cross 30%, pushing the price as low as $0.33. However, after this, fireworks are expected to follow as the XRP price begins its uptrend. From here, the altcoin is expected to clear the $1 easily, moving toward new all-time highs in the process. As for how high the XRP price could go, the crypto analyst believes that it could rise as high as $8.80. If this happens, it would mean a 2,566% increase from the $0.33 lows expected after the price crash. The analyst speculates that the timeframe for the altcoin’s price to touch this new all-time high is sometime in summer 2025. So, somewhere between June and September 2025. The State Of The Ripple Vs. SEC Lawsuit Currently, the battle between Ripple and the SEC rages on as the regulator has appealed the court’s decision that secondary programmatic sales of XRP tokens do not count as a securities offering. The outcome of the appeal is still heavily debated but securities lawyer Marc Fagel has offered various possibilities. Related Reading: XRP Price To Reach $40? Crypto Analyst Says You Should Get In Right Now On an X (formerly Twitter) post, Fagel stated; “The Court of Appeals could conclude the district court erred in stating that XRP is not itself a security; and if it is, then the holding on programmatic sales gets reversed. But they could also reverse the programmatic sales without addressing the question of XRP being a security per se (as seems more likely).” However, way the appeal does play out, the consensus remains that a final end to the battle between the crypto firm and the regulator would be good for the XRP price. Projections following the outcome have ranged from a price tag of $1 to as high as $100.

33534811,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641542,1726221619,Legendary Bitcoin Puell Multiple Finally Enters ‘Buy’ Territory,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Puell Multiple has recently declined into the historical bottom zone as BTC’s continued consolidation. Bitcoin Puell Multiple Is Now Under The 0.4 Level As an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post explained, the BTC Puell Multiple has declined under 0.4 for the first time since the end of 2022. The “Puell Multiple” here refers to a popular on-chain indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the daily Bitcoin miner revenue and the 365-day moving average (MA) of the same. The daily miner revenue here refers to the USD value of the BTC amount the chain validators receive as compensation for solving blocks on the network. Miners also earn revenue from another source, the transaction fees, but in the context of the Puell Multiple, only the first component, often called the Issuance, is relevant. Related Reading: Which Altcoins Could Skyrocket Next? Analytics Firm Points To These When the value of this ratio is greater than 1, miners are currently making more revenue from block subsidy than the average for the past year. Similarly, it being under the threshold suggests these chain validators are earning less than usual. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Puell Multiple over the past decade: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Puell Multiple had shot up earlier in the year and peaked in April. The rally mainly caused this surge that BTC had witnessed in the first quarter of 2024. It’s apparent from the chart, though, that the indicator had observed a sharp plunge under the 1 mark right after this peak. The reason behind this lies in an event that had occurred then: the fourth Halving. Halvings are periodic events programmed into the Bitcoin blockchain that permanently slash the BTC block subsidy in half every four years. With the Issuance being halved during the latest such event, it makes sense that the Puell Multiple registered a crash. As BTC’s price has been showing a slow descent in the months since then, the USD value of the miner revenue has also been declining, which has naturally been reflected in the Puell Multiple. With its latest downward move, the indicator is under the 0.4 level. Historically, the zone below this 0.4 mark has proven significant for the Bitcoin price. As the quant has highlighted in the graph, the asset has tended to form bottoms when the metric has been in this region. Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs Shiba Inu Vs Pepe: How Do The Top Memecoins Compare In Investor Profits? The last time Puell Multiple was in this bottoming zone was when the cryptocurrency had observed its bear market lows in 2022. Given these past examples, it’s possible that the Bitcoin price would follow and show something similar this time. That said, the price has generally only reached a bottom after BTC has spent some time in this zone. As such, it may be a while before the coin can reach a rebound, assuming the pattern holds. BTC Price Bitcoin has been trying to move beyond the $58,000 mark during the past day, but the asset has been unable to gather enough momentum, with the latest attempt sending the coin to $57,600.

The vote, which went live on Tuesday, passed with overwhelming support, but only 0.08% of eligible voters holding Starknet’s native token, STRK, participated. 98.94% voted in favor of implementing staking, while 0.45% abstained, and 0.61% voted against it.  The new mechanism on Starknet means that anyone holding more than 20,000 STRK will be able to stake on the network, from the fourth quarter of this year.  “A minting mechanism that strikes a balance between rewarding stakers and setting inflation expectations was also approved in the vote,” StarkWare, the main developer firm behind the Starknet blockchain, wrote in a press release shared with CoinDesk.  To power the governance process, Starknet is making use of Snapshot X, the governance protocol that the team behind Snapshot released Tuesday and its first on-chain feature.  “Snapshot X determines voting power based on the voters’ STRK holdings,” StarkWare wrote. “The goal is to ensure votes are coming from genuine community members, and to prevent people outside of the community from buying STRK today, voting, and then selling the day after. To achieve this, Snapshot X takes a snapshot of STRK holdings at predetermined time.”  Read more: Snapshot, Popular DAO Voting Platform, Finally Moves On-Chain, Atop Starknet",POSITIVE,STRK,BLOCKCHAIN | SPONSORED | STRK,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/09/13/starknet-token-holders-ratify-plan-to-implement-staking-in-landmark-decentralized-election,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/645e2f4365f470d83de3e2a6b2f4f2e3bcc893c1-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33533195,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641593,1726218041,Bitcoin Price Set For Major Breakout? Coinbase Premium Signals Imminent Move,"Recent analysis from CryptoQuant highlights that Bitcoin price may soon undergo a significant move, according to an indicator known as the Coinbase Premium. A CryptoQuant analyst under the pseudonym ‘Avocado Onchain’ noted earlier today that the Coinbase Premium, which measures the price gap between Bitcoin on Coinbase and Binance, is showing signs of convergence. The narrowing of this premium suggests that Bitcoin’s price is approaching its fair value, leading many to believe that a decisive move is imminent. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Leverage Ratio Hits New High: What Does This Mean BTC? How Does The Coinbase Premium Suggest Big Move Ahead For Bitcoin? The Coinbase Premium reflects the difference in Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase compared to other exchanges, primarily Binance. When this premium is high, it suggests that US institutional investors, who often favor Coinbase, are buying more Bitcoin, pushing the price higher. Conversely, a low or negative premium indicates that these investors are either selling or that demand is higher on other exchanges like Binance. Avocado Onchain identified that the Coinbase Premium has gradually been narrowing in the past few weeks, with the price gap between Coinbase and Binance shrinking. According to the analyst, this convergence creates a triangular pattern on the one-hour chart, signaling that a decisive price move is approaching. While the direction of this move remains uncertain, previous instances of such convergence patterns have led to significant upward price movements in Bitcoin. For instance, the analyst mentioned that a similar pattern was observed during the 2021-2022 bull market, with the Coinbase Premium forming a triangular convergence. The moment this pattern was completed, Bitcoin’s price surged to new all-time highs. The analysis noted: I believe that the current triangular pattern in the Coinbase Premium reflects a standoff among large investors (whales), as they cautiously gauge each other’s moves before the next major price shift. BTC Market Performance And Outlook After previous attempts, Bitcoin could once again trade above the $58,000 mark earlier today with a 24-hour high of $58,435. However, according to the latest data, the top crypto has now corrected as it trades below it with a current trading price of $57,619 at the time of writing, though still up by 1.5% in the past day.

42407669,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0Pyo,1726217051,Bitcoin's Dilemma: Follow Gold's Market Beating Rally or Stick With Technology Stocks?,"Idiosyncratic factors keep BTC under pressure as gold rallies to record high.  Gold's surge hints at a favorable macroeconomic conditions for bitcoin ahead.  Some analysts caution against reading too much into the gold rally.  Gold rose to a new record high reaching $2,564 per ounce on Friday, taking its quarter-to-date gain to 10%. Bitcoin {{BTC}}, often touted as digital gold, remained under pressure at nearly $58,000, representing a 7% quarterly loss, according to CoinDesk data.  The yellow metal's performance looks even more impressive, if you consider that Wall Street's benchmark index (S&P 500) has only eked out a meager 2% rise this quarter. Bitcoin has recently moved in tandem with technology stocks amid fears of a U.S. economic recession and the threat of mass unwinding of the ""risk-on yen carry trades.""  Most observers are of the opinion that idiosyncratic factors are responsible for the ongoing BTC-gold divergence, and the rally in the yellow metal suggests favorable macroeconomic conditions for the cryptocurrency ahead.  Per Charlie Morris, chief investment officer and founder of ByteTree, gold's surge is linked to increased accumulation by central banks, a privilege bitcoin still lacks, which also suggests monetary policy easing eahead.  ""The appeal of government bond in reserves is lesser and gold has stepped up. Many central banks are accumulating gold, which used to be priced off U.S. Treasury inflation-protected securities but is now being influenced by global factors like structural government deficits,"" Morris told CoinDesk.  ""The strength in gold reflects increasing current and future [fiat] money supply, among other things, and bitcoin will rally when the economy picks up or when the sound of stimulus is heard,"" Morris added.  The year-on-year change in the combined fiat money supply growth of U.S., Eurozone, U.K. and Japan flipped positive in August and could continue to grow as central banks embark on renewed liquidity easing. The European Central Bank cut interest rates on Thursday, and the Fed is likely to do the same next week, kicking off the so-called easing cycle, meaning stateside investors could soon hear the sound of stimulus.  André Dragosch, head of research Europe at Bitwise, opined that gold's rally likely indicates a sharp slide in inflation-adjusted U.S. government bond yields ahead. The decline in the so-called real yields typically has investors rotating money into riskier investments like bitcoin and technology stocks, as observed in 2020.  ""Gold prices have completely decoupled from U.S. real yields. This implies two things: Either gold is overpriced, or gold is already anticipating a massive decline in U.S. real yields,"" Dragosch told CoinDesk. ""A massive decline in U.S. real yields is equivalent to a sharp easing in monetary policy, which is not yet priced more broadly into financial markets except in gold, which is why bitcoin and other assets might follow gold higher.""  The U.S. 10-year real has already pulled back to 1.61%, the lowest in over a year, from the peak of 2.52% in October, according to data source TradingView.  Gold-bitcoin demand divergence  Central banks snapped up 37 tonnes of Gold in July, doubling net purchases from the preceding month, according to the World Gold Council. That's the highest monthly since January, when net purchases were 45 tonnes.  In 2022, central banks purchased a 1,037 tonnes of gold, the second-highest annual purchase in history, following a record 1,082 tonnes in 2022.  In contrast, the bitcoin market has been hit with supply worth billions of dollars since June, thanks to liquidations by Germany's Saxony state, Mt. Gox creditor reimbursements and the U.S. government.  Meanwhile, the uptake for the 11 U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds has weakened in recent months and the funds have witnessed a net outflow of around $1 billion since late August, according to data source Farside Investors.  The outflows and supply increase explains BTC's dour performance, according to the LondonCryptoClub newsletter service.  ""Gold is anticipating lower real rates, rising liquidity and a softer dollar, much like bitcoin. Overlaying that, however, is the supply/demand dynamic. Gold has seen huge demand from central banks, but little negative supply, whereas bitcoin has had to digest a lot of supply in recent months from the German and U.S. government and the Mt Gox distribution,"" founders of the LondonCryptoClub told CoinDesk  ""Short-term, gold outperformance can be seen as a lead on where BTC should be headed,"" founders added.  That said, not everyone in the crypto market is psyched by the gold rally.  Alex Kruger, a partner at the digital assets and macro advisory firm Asgard Markets, cautioned investors from reading too much into the gold rally as far as bitcoin is concerned.  ""Its irrelevant. Bitcoin never trades with gold. When you look too intently into something, you end up seeing what you want to,"" Kruger said in a Telegram chat, as some market participants drew parallels with 2020 when gold rose to record highs before BTC.  Besides, traders should be watchful of a renewed August-like growth scare in risk assets, which saw BTC nosedive to $50,000. A potential 50 basis point rate cut by the Fed next week might just do that.  ""Bitcoin is a risk-on asset, gold risk-off. Gold likes the system to be cold and falling rates. In contrast, bitcoin likes the system to be overheating,"" Morris noted.

The token has led the feline sector, becoming the first cat-themed cryptocurrency to reach a $1 billion market capitalization. Whales have noticed the token’s recent performance, loading their bags with millions of tokens in the last few days. Related Reading: Failed Solana Token Scheme? Hacker Targets 2.6 Million Indian Cricket Fans With X Scam Whales Go Popping Their Bags On-chain analytics firm Lookonchain revealed that a crypto whale had purchased millions of POPCAT today. The purchase was made by an investor who previously held the memecoin but sold its holdings earlier this month. Per the report, the whale bought 2.36 million POPCAT in the early hours of Thursday at an average price of $0.68. The address swapped 1.47 million USDC in 9 transactions varying from 150,000 to 200,000 USDC. After Lookonchain’s post, the investor purchased another 299,345 tokens for 200,000 USDC. In the past eight hours, the whale acquired a total of $2.66 million POPCAT, worth $1.75 million, at an average price of $0.65. The on-chain data firm also noted that this address purchased 6.05 million POPCAT between April 21 and April 26. At the time, the investor spent 1.84 million USDC for the memecoin. However, they sold the tokens a week ago for 3.31 million USDC, making a profit of over $1.47 million in the stablecoin. Similarly, online reports revealed that another whale address has been on a shopping spree for the last three days. This address bought 5.67 million tokens on Monday, worth around $3 million, in three Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) transactions. Since then, the investor has continued to purchase the cat-themed memecoin, acquiring another 470,000 tokens today, valued at $308,000. As a result, the address now holds a total of 6.14 million POPCAT, worth $3.88 million. Is Popcat About To Lead The ‘Cat Season’? Following the whales’ transactions, POPCAT’s daily activity surged 25%, jumping to a daily trading volume of $151 million. The memecoin’s price also saw a significant 20% increase, hitting the $0.067 mark earlier today. The token’s performance made POPCAT the largest gainer among the top 10 memecoins, leading the sectors’ rally. Additionally, it became the largest daily gainer among the 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, seemingly fueling a bullish sentiment among investors. Some market watchers noted that the memecoin has been in “an uptrend ever since” the rest of the market started its downtrend in March. The cat-themed token displays green numbers in the longer timeframes, registering 17%, 139%, and 110% increases in the one-month, three-month, and six-month timeframes. Sjuul from AltCryptoGems highlighted POPCAT’s performance throughout September, bouncing from the $0.45 zone before reclaiming the $0.55 support level in the last seven days. Previously, the trader noted that the cryptocurrency failed to reclaim the $0.7 resistance level as August ended, resulting in a price drop to the $0.55 support zone. The token’s price continued to fall below the $0.50 mark in the following days. According to the post, the memecoin continued to move inside a bullish structure despite the dip. However, the trader deemed that investors should watch out for key support levels at the $0.50 and $0.40-40.45 ranges in the following weeks. Related Reading: Altcoins About To Take Over? Analyst Suggests Time To Accumulate Will End Soon To Sjuul “bouncing at either one of these two levels would imply that bulls are still in control of the market structure.” This would ensure that the memecoin forms a “new higher low on the high time frame,” opening “the gate to a further push into resistance” and could ultimately lead to a massive rally. As of this writing, the cryptocurrency has reclaimed the $0.65 price range, currently trading at $0.655. POPCAT's performance in the weekly-chart.

A California Judge ruled last month that the SEC's lawsuit against Kraken will proceed to trial.  Kraken suggested action had been taken against it for exercising its first amendment.  Crypto exchange Kraken has demanded a jury trial in the case brought against it by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a court filing Thursday showed.  A California Judge ruled last month that the SEC's lawsuit against Kraken will proceed to trial. The verdict came after similar rulings in cases brought on by the agency against Binance and Coinbase (COIN), which also face allegations of violating federal securities laws by not registering as a broker, clearinghouse or exchange with the SEC.  The SEC sued Kraken in the Northern District of California last November asking the court to permanently enjoin the exchange from further securities violations, seeking disgorgement of its “ill-gotten gains” and other civil penalties. The regulator listed ADA, ALGO, ATOM, FIL, FLOW, ICP, MANA, MATIC, NEAR, OMG, and the SOL tokens as the 11 unregistered securities.  In Thursday's court filing, Kraken reiterated its position denying that it has engaged in illegal conduct, responding to each allegation in the SEC's lawsuit and presenting 18 other defenses.  Kraken's legal argument appeared to be based on its interpretation of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act because neither includes digital assets. The exchange said it never registered with the SEC because it was never required to do so, and that it was not an exchange, a broker dealer or a clearing agent within the meaning of the Exchange Act.  The firm further argued that the SEC failed to state ""a claim upon which relief may be granted because it did not have the authority to regulate Kraken.""  ""The digital assets themselves cannot be the investment contracts because they carry none of the rights and obligations of a share of stock, a bond, or any other financial asset that Congress has said is subject to SEC regulation,"" the filing said.  Kraken admitted to listing more than 220 crypto assets globally, permitting margin trading, over-the-counter trading desk, instant buy features, and customer applications, but denied that these services transform its platform into a securities exchange, clearing agency, or broker-dealer.  Specifically, Kraken accused the SEC of acting without due process and fair notice, suggesting action had been taken against it for exercising its first amendment.

Analyst Predicts Bull Run As Key Metric Approaches Critical Level,"Ethereum appears to have now seen a notable shift in its major metric. Particularly, a recent CryptoQuant analyst, Burak Kesmeci report, highlighted the potential significance of Ethereum’s current funding rates. The analyst pointed out that similar patterns in the past have been followed by substantial price increases, suggesting that Ethereum might be on the verge of a new surge. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts $4,000 Mid-Term Target for Ethereum, Declares End to ETH Correction Calm Before The Storm? Funding rates are a key future market metric, indicating the balance between long and short positions. When the funding rate stays low for an extended period, it can signal market indecision or calm, but if the rate rises sharply, it often precedes a strong price movement. According to the report by Kesmeci, Ethereum’s funding rates have been hovering between 0.002 and 0.005, a relatively low level last seen in September 2023. The funding rate then spiked above 0.015, followed by a price rally from $1,500 to over $4,000. The analyst further explored whether Ethereum’s funding rate in September 2024 could signal a similar price movement. The current low funding rates have persisted for about a month, starting from August. This situation mirrors the period before last year’s significant price surge. September and the final quarter have historically been pivotal times for crypto markets, often seeing increased trading volume and price gains as summer ends. However, Kesmeci noted: I can’t say if history will repeat itself, but there’s certainly a rhythm to it. We will wait for Ether’s funding rate to rise above 0.015 to see if the calm before the storm breaks. A move above this level in funding rates is crucial for tracking healthy increases during bull markets. How Is Ethereum Faring So Far? While Ethereum hasn’t seen a further decrease following its low of $2,197 last month, the asset hasn’t seen a major price increase in the past weeks. Instead, ETH has continued to consolidate within a specific range. Following an attempt to create a new all-time high back in March, trading above $4,000, ETH has seen a consistent decline ever since and has remained below $3,000 since August. So far, the asset has declined 2.7% in the past weeks and has also seen a 0.7% increase in the past 24 hours. However, the asset remains below the $3,000 mark, currently trading for $2,331 at the time of writing. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees Massive Outflows from Derivatives: What Does This Mean For ETH?

The price is now consolidating gains and might aim for more gains above $550. BNB price started a fresh increase above the $525 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $535 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a short-term rising channel forming with support at $540 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $525 pivot level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Settles Above $525 In the last analysis, we discussed the chance of more gains in BNB price above the $525 resistance. The price outperformed Ethereum and Bitcoin. It surged above the $525 and $535 levels. It even tested the $550 resistance zone. A high was formed at $549.5 and the price started a downside correction. There was a move below the $545 level. The price slipped just below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $507 swing low to the $549 high. The pair is now trading above $535 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a short-term rising channel forming with support at $540 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $548 level. The next resistance sits near the $550 level. A clear move above the $550 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $562. A close above the $562 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $580 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $585 level in the near term. Are Dips Limited? If BNB fails to clear the $550 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $540 level and the channel trend line. The next major support is near the $525 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $507 swing low to the $549 high. The main support sits at $520. If there is a downside break below the $520 support, the price could drop toward the $505 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $500 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently above the 50 level.

33527407,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641588,1726203657,Dogecoin Registers 4% Increase Following Elon Musk’s Latest Post – Key Levels To Watch,"Dogecoin (DOGE), the leading meme coin in the crypto sphere, witnessed a notable uptick on Thursday, propelled by the influential backing of Tesla and SpaceX tycoon Elon Musk, a longstanding advocate of the digital asset. Musk once again showcased his support for Dogecoin through a cleverly crafted social media post, triggering a surge in the token’s value and stirring reactions across the cryptocurrency community. Elon Musk’s DOGE Humor Boosts Price, Michael Saylor Chimes In In a characteristic move on Thursday, the tech mogul, who now owns the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), addressed two topics in a single post. Elon Musk referenced former President Donald Trump’s proposal for him to spearhead a government efficiency commission, encapsulating the idea with the phrase “Department Of Government Efficiency,” cleverly abbreviated as DOGE. Related Reading: Grayscale Unveils First XRP Trust In The US, ETF Ahead? This playful nod not only fueled a rally in Dogecoin’s price but also prompted responses from industry figures like Michael Saylor, a prominent Bitcoin proponent, who retorted with the acronym “Banish, Tedious, Complexity” (BTC), underscoring the enduring appeal of Bitcoin. This recent episode follows Musk’s earlier engagement with the Dogecoin community, where an X post featuring an image of the billionaire spelled out the word DOGE, triggering a price resurgence for the cryptocurrency. Subsequently, DOGE’s value experienced a revival, inching closer to the $0.10 mark. Despite a modest pullback, the token secured a 2% increase on Sunday, reclaiming the $0.096 threshold. Dogecoin Price Analysis Musk’s latest social media intervention has propelled Dogecoin towards $0.101, marking a substantial surge of nearly 4% over the past week and over 2% within the last 24 hours. Nonetheless, the daily trading volume for the meme coin has not mirrored this bullish momentum. CoinGecko data indicates a $508 million trading volume in the last 24 hours, reflecting a 10% decline amidst broader market uncertainties. Related Reading: SUI Bulls Gear Up, Can They Push Through The $1.16 Ceiling? Preventing further gains for the token, DOGE is still trading just below its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.107, which could act as a short-term resistance wall for bullish investors in the scenario that the current momentum continues. This is also because Dogecoin has seen additional downward pressure in longer time frames, amounting to nearly 4% over the past month, mirroring the struggles of major cryptocurrencies that have failed to regain higher levels. Furthermore, the prevailing bearish market sentiment, compounded by the lack of significant macroeconomic catalysts, has hindered the potential for further price upside across the digital asset landscape.

It is now consolidating gains above $0.550 and might aim for more gains in the near term. XRP price gained pace for a move above the $0.550 resistance zone. The price is now trading above $0.550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a new connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $0.550 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could regain traction if it stays above the $0.550 pivot level. XRP Price Gains Momentum XRP price remained well-supported above the $0.5320 level like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price started a fresh increase and was able to clear the key hurdle at $0.5420. There was a surge above the $0.5550 and $0.5650 levels. The price even tested the $0.5870 zone. A high was formed at $0.5869 and the price started a sharp pullback. There was a move below the $0.5720 level.

The trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5234 swing low to the $0.5869 high. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5660 level. The first major resistance is near the $0.5720 level. The next key resistance could be $0.5850. A clear move above the $0.5850 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5920 resistance. The next major resistance is near the $0.600 level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.6050 resistance or even $0.6120 in the near term. More Downsides? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5660 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5550 level. The next major support is $0.5500. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5500 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5380 support in the near term. The next major support sits at $0.5250.

42407668,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga0PvV,1726200861,Kalshi's New Political Prediction Markets Halted as CFTC Appeals Loss,"A U.S. federal appeals court halted Kalshi's brand-new political prediction markets, heeding the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's request for an emergency stay after the regulator lost a similar motion to a lower-level judge.  Judge Jia Cobb of the District of Columbia court ruled last week that the CFTC exceeded its authority by banning Kalshi from listing U.S. political prediction markets, basically bets on which party might control the House of Representatives or win the White House in any given term. Kalshi, the plaintiff in the case, sued the CFTC, arguing the agency was behaving arbitrarily in banning these markets.  The CFTC initially asked Judge Cobb, who's overseeing the case, to still prevent Kalshi from listing any contracts while it waited for her full opinion, which she published Thursday morning. The judge denied the CFTC's request, and Kalshi listed its first U.S. political prediction markets in the afternoon. The CFTC filed an emergency motion to stay the markets to the appeals court while it considers whether to appeal the full ruling, court records showed Thursday.  Trading on Kalshi's two new contracts, asking which party will win the House and Senate, was paused as of 11:30 p.m. ET Thurday (03:30 UTC Friday), with a notice on Kalshi's website citing a ""pending court process.""  ""Appellee KalshiEx LLC ('LLC'), knowing that this Court’s review was imminent, has raced to launch its election gambling contracts on the same day the District Court issued a memorandum opinion, before Appellant the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ('Commission' or 'CFTC') has had the opportunity to file this motion for stay pending appeal about the serious legal issues and public interests at stake,"" the CFTC said in its filing.  Kalshi wouldn't be harmed much if the appeals court temporarily halted its contracts, while the public interest may be harmed more if the contracts continued, the CFTC argued.  Kalshi's attorneys pushed back, saying ""no administrative stay is necessary or appropriate.""  ""Kalshi will promptly oppose the CFTC’s renewed stay motion on the merits in this Court. But in the meantime, no administrative stay is necessary or appropriate. Judge Cobb’s decision on the merits was clearly correct because the statute empowers the CFTC to block event contracts only if they involve (as relevant here) 'gaming' or 'unlawful activity,'"" the company's letter said. ""As Judge Cobb observed, elections are neither.""  The appeals court ordered Kalshi to halt its contracts while it considers the motion, and ordered Kalshi to file a response by Friday evening. The CFTC can file a reply by Saturday evening.  The CFTC is also in the middle of a rulemaking process to ban political prediction markets in general from the U.S., citing concerns about policing fraud in the underlying market – namely, elections.  Judge Cobb, in her Thursday opinion, said she was sympathetic to that reasoning but it was irrelevant to her assessment of the agency's case against Kalshi specifically.",NEGATIVE,없음,COMMODITY | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/09/13/kalshis-new-political-prediction-markets-halted-as-cftc-appeals-loss,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6cf6d5a3ada20c376051ec9efbc9bd8be91cef57-1980x1020.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The analyst also revealed what happened the last time this pattern formed, suggesting that the leading crypto could enjoy a significant price rally soon enough. Golden Cross Forms On The Bitcoin Chart Titan of Crypto revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Golden Cross has formed on Bitcoin’s 2-month chart. He added that the leading crypto company experienced a “massive” rally every time this bullish indicator appeared on its 2-month chart. His accompanying chart showed that this happened last in 2021 when Bitcoin rose from around $13,000 to above $60,000. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Accumulation: Whales Pull Out $4 Million From Exchanges, Can SHIB Recover? While it remains to be seen what will happen this time, there is no doubt that a significant rally is long overdue for the leading crypto, considering how its price has stagnated since reaching a new all-time high (ATH) of $73,000 in March earlier this year. In another X post, Titan of Crypto suggested that the much-anticipated Bitcoin rally could begin in October. The crypto analyst noted how the historical bearish September always sets the stage for risk assets like Bitcoin and US stocks to end the year with a big bounce. Meanwhile, Titan of Crypto is still confident about Bitcoin’s bullish outlook despite calls that it is now in a downtrend. He stated that Bitcoin is still bullish on the monthly timeframe. He added that the crypto is still holding its Tenkan and claimed that its bullish outlook will remain intact as long as it holds above the Tenkan line at $49,900. Based on the accompanying chart he shared, Bitcoin needs to break above $71,000 to reach a new ATH in this market cycle. The crypto analyst had earlier predicted that the flagship crypto could reach a market high of $120,000 by 2025. October Is The Month To Look Forward To Crypto analyst Rekt Capital also echoed a sentiment similar to Titan of Crypto, suggesting that October is the month to look forward to. He noted that history suggests Bitcoin should enjoy a breakout from the reaccumulation range in the next two weeks.

BTC is now showing positive signs and might aim for a move toward $60,000. Bitcoin is attempting a fresh increase above the $57,200 support zone. The price is trading above $57,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a key contracting triangle forming with resistance at $58,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could climb higher if it clears the $58,500 and $58,650 resistance levels in the near term. Bitcoin Price Could Extend Gains Bitcoin price started a decent increase after it broke the $57,000 resistance zone. BTC was able to climb above the $57,500 resistance. The pair even cleared the $58,000 resistance zone. However, the bears seem to be active near the $58,500 resistance zone. A high is formed at $58,450 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $58,000 level. The price even dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $55,550 swing low to the $58,450 high. Bitcoin is now trading above $57,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $58,500 level. There is also a key contracting triangle forming with resistance at $58,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The first key resistance is near the $58,650 level. A clear move above the $58,650 resistance might start a steady increase in the coming sessions. The next key resistance could be $59,200. A close above the $59,200 resistance might spark more upsides. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $60,000 resistance. Another Drop In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $58,500 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $57,600 level. The first major support is $56,650 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $55,550 swing low to the $58,450 high. The next support is now near the $56,220 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $55,550 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone.

33523190,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641478,1726192842,Bitcoin To Hit $100K? Investors Believe US Election Won’t Affect Its Rise,"No matter who wins the US presidential contest this November, the trajectory of Bitcoin seems to be set to remain strong despite growing partisan fervor. Related Reading: AAVE Excites Investors With 20% Gain As Developments Roll Out Market observers and crypto enthusiasts mostly believe that the long-term future of Bitcoin is safe. Former President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto posture inspired recent hope that is starting to wane, although this has not affected the general state of the sector. US Election: Effect On Bitcoin’s Value Although some forecast instantaneous changes in price depending on election outcomes, the longer-term impact on Bitcoin could be negligible. Head of private clients at Swan Bitcoin Steven Lubka thinks, independent of any outcome, Bitcoin might hit six figures by 2025. James Davies of Crypto Valley Exchange also remarked, suggesting that fears about a future Kamala Harris presidency affecting Bitcoin’s price are overblown. He notes that while crypto businesses may struggle, the broader industry will keep growing. With Bitcoin’s growing institutionalization—especially with US Bitcoin ETFs recently added—it is clear that its fundamental ideas are good. Short-Term Variability And Market Vibe The election can cause some temporary fluctuation in the price of Bitcoin. While a Harris victory would trigger a brief downturn, analysts predict that if Trump wins there might be a big price increase. Tyrone Ross of 401 Financial, on the other hand, thinks that the outcome of the election will have only a negligible effect on the performance of Bitcoin within the next year or so. The macroeconomic considerations and present market trends are perhaps more important in determining the price swings of Bitcoin. Having peaked at $73,000 early in the year, Bitcoin has traded between $54,000 and $65,000 for most of 2024. Recent price fluctuations are attributed more to global economic conditions and interest rate changes rather than US election news. Related Reading: Analysts Predict XRP ‘Mega Pump’ And ‘Perpetual Cycle’ – Details Looking Beyond Political Uncertainty Despite all the political noise, bitcoin has proven incredibly resilient. Daniel Cawrey from Tonkeeper says the election has done a great deal to raise awareness for the bitcoin space in earnest. In contrast to the Biden administration, which has largely tried to sweep crypto under the rug, Kamala Harris has tended to interact with industry participants – albeit in a way that at least could bring more clarity to guidelines and regulations. As Cawrey notes, more regulatory clarity resulting from this higher engagement would help the sector. Lubka agrees; Bitcoin has flourished even in adverse surroundings. Despite political and legal obstacles, Bitcoin has shown resilience throughout its history surpassing numerous assets. In essence, Bitcoin’s long-term future is bright even if the US presidential election can cause some transient market reactions. The rising institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies and more general economic considerations drive them forward and help them to be positioned for success independent of political drama.

33513472,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641565,1726185712,Crypto Analyst See 300% Rally on The Way For Internet Computer (ICP) and Mpeppe (MPEPE),"As we head deeper into 2024, the cryptocurrency market continues to surprise investors with promising opportunities. Among the most discussed potential breakout tokens are Internet Computer (ICP) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). Both cryptocurrencies have attracted the attention of analysts and investors alike, who predict that these assets could see gains upwards of 300% in the near future. With Internet Computer (ICP) showcasing renewed strength and Mpeppe gaining traction as a high-potential meme coin, the two tokens are positioned for impressive growth. In this article, we’ll dive into why these two cryptos could be poised for massive rallies, and why now might be the time to jump in before the next wave of gains. Why Internet Computer (ICP) is Attracting Investor Attention Internet Computer (ICP) has been steadily gaining momentum in 2024. After experiencing a series of dips in the latter half of 2023, Internet Computer (ICP) began to regain its footing, surging over 12% in the past seven days. With its current price standing at around $8.5, Internet Computer (ICP) has shown resilience, particularly when compared to other Layer-1 blockchain projects. The anticipation for a breakout above the $10 mark is growing, with analysts setting their sights on $11—the resistance level the token struggled to break past in July. One of the reasons for Internet Computer’s (ICP) growing momentum is the increasing use cases and applications built on its blockchain. As one of the most scalable and decentralized Layer-1 blockchains, Internet Computer (ICP) is designed to enhance the speed, security, and efficiency of decentralized applications (dApps). This has attracted a growing number of developers and users to the ecosystem, contributing to the positive price action in recent weeks. Moreover, the recent spike in trading volume suggests that the bulls may be gearing up for a major push. ICP’s technical indicators, including the Money Flow Index (MFI) and MACD, are flashing bullish signals, further solidifying predictions of a potential 300% rally. The key levels to watch are the $9 resistance and the $10 psychological barrier, both of which could spark a sharp upward move once breached. The Mpeppe (MPEPE) Meme Coin Phenomenon While Internet Computer (ICP) represents the more established side of the crypto world, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is carving out its own niche as a fast-rising meme coin with serious upside potential. Since its introduction to the market, Mpeppe has quickly gained popularity among meme coin enthusiasts and early adopters, with many investors comparing it to the likes of Shiba Inu and PepeCoin. What makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) particularly interesting is its ability to tap into the meme culture while offering a community-driven project with strong growth potential. The token’s current price sits at $0.0021, and experts predict that it could easily surge past $0.01 once it is fully listed on major exchanges and completes the final stages of its presale. With 80% of its presale already completed, the excitement surrounding Mpeppe is palpable. As more investors pile in, the token’s low entry price and high upside potential make it a prime target for those looking to secure early gains. Some analysts have even suggested that Mpeppe could follow in the footsteps of other successful meme coins and deliver 300% or more in returns within the next year. 3 Reasons Why Both Tokens Could Surge in 2024 Here are three key reasons why both Internet Computer (ICP) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are likely to see significant rallies in 2024: 1. Growing Developer Interest and Use Cases for ICP Internet Computer (ICP) continues to attract attention due to its ability to support scalable and efficient decentralized applications. As more projects choose Internet Computer (ICP) as their platform of choice, the increased network activity will drive demand for the token, pushing its price higher. With major updates and new partnerships on the horizon, the momentum is expected to carry forward into 2024. 2. Mpeppe’s Growing Community and Viral Appeal Mpeppe (MPEPE) benefits from its strong meme coin appeal and growing community support. In the world of meme coins, a dedicated community is often the key driver of price appreciation. As Mpeppe nears the completion of its presale and prepares for exchange listings, the viral nature of the project could propel it to new heights, delivering massive returns for early investors. 3. Whale Activity and Bullish Technical Indicators Whale activity has been increasing for both tokens. Large investors have been steadily accumulating Internet Computer (ICP) and Mpeppe, which often signals that a big price move is on the horizon. Additionally, bullish technical indicators such as the MACD crossover for Internet Computer (ICP) and the rising social sentiment for Mpeppe suggest that both assets are poised for strong upward momentum. Conclusion: Is Now the Time to Invest? As we move through the final months of 2024, both Internet Computer (ICP) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer compelling opportunities for investors. ICP is gaining traction thanks to its robust blockchain ecosystem and improving technical indicators, while Mpeppe is drawing attention as a potential breakout meme coin with significant upside. For those looking to diversify their portfolios with a mix of established and emerging tokens, both ICP and Mpeppe should be on the radar. With the possibility of 300% gains on the horizon, now might be the perfect time to consider investing in these two exciting assets.

33520492,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=641390,1726185627,Which Altcoins Could Skyrocket Next? Analytics Firm Points To These,"The on-chain analytics firm Santiment has pointed out how these three altcoins may be more likely to see price jumps in the coming future. These Altcoins Are Being Heavily Shorted On Binance Right Now In a new post on X, Santiment has discussed about some altcoins that could be worth keeping an eye on because of a trend forming in their Binance Funding Rate. The Funding Rate here refers to an indicator that tracks the periodic amount of fees that traders on a given derivatives exchange (in this case, Binance) are paying each other right now. Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs Shiba Inu Vs Pepe: How Do The Top Memecoins Compare In Investor Profits? When the value of this metric is positive, it means the long investors are paying a fee to the short holders in order to keep their positions. Such a trend suggests the majority of the derivatives users share a bullish sentiment. On the other hand, the indicator being negative implies the shorts are outweighing the longs, so a bearish mentality could be assumed to be the dominant one in the sector. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Binance Funding Rate for three altcoins, Aave (AAVE), The Graph (GRT), and Decentraland (MANA), over the past week: As is visible in the above graph, the Binance Funding Rate has recently switched from green to red for all three of these altcoins. This would suggest that the investors have opened a large amount of short positions on the exchange related to these assets, thus shifting the balance. Interestingly, this heavy shorting from the investors has come as the cryptocurrency market as a whole has been rebounding, led by Bitcoin’s recovery back above $58,000. It would appear that derivatives users don’t expect AAVE, GRT, and MANA to continue the bullish wave. This pessimism around the altcoins, however, can actually play into the benefit of their prices. This is because mass liquidation events are more likely to affect the side of the market with the most positions. At present, the dominant side is the bearish one, so mass short liquidations could likely occur in the coming days. Whenever a large amount of liquidations take place at once (an event that’s popularly known as a squeeze), the price can see a burst of volatility arising out of all this fuel. As such, Santiment believes that should these shorts get caught in a liquidation event, the altcoins could see big price jumps. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovery: Has BTC Prevented A Fall To $41,000 With This Surge? It only remains to be seen, though, whether Aave and others would show price surges from here and punish these investors betting on a bearish outcome. Aave Price Aave has been enjoying bullish momentum during the last few days as its price has risen to $147 after witnessing a surge of over 11% in the last seven days.

Less than a year after transiting to the mainnet after months of testing, the platform is taking bold steps to scale the base layer and further boost data availability. Celestia Plans For 1 GB Blocks For Scaling In a recent announcement, the platform’s core developers said it was preparing for the next phase, which will see the blockchain introduce 1 GB blocks. The decision to unleash 1 GB blocks will be a major move to scale on-chain and push throughput even higher. Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs Shiba Inu Vs Pepe: How Do The Top Memecoins Compare In Investor Profits? It will only make sense. Celestia uses a modular architecture that allows the network to scale. Unlike Ethereum, which is struggling to scale on-chain and heavily reliant on off-chain platforms like Base and StarkNet, Celestia remains scalable and flexible, circumventing challenges legacy networks encounter. With 1GB blocks and scaling increased, Celestia said developers would be free to build whatever they wish. Exemplifying progress made by modern chains, developers are not confined to deploying smart contracts using a single programming language like struggles to scale on-chain, which is Solidity or Rust. Instead, they can choose what they are comfortable with. To achieve the 1 GB blocks, Celestia plans to introduce innovations such as content-addressable mempools and compact blocks. Moreover, plans will be made to deploy internally sharding nodes and improve its data availability sampling protocol. TIA Down 80%, Will The Supply Uptick Fast-Track The Dump? Impressive as this could be, TIA, the native currency, has been on a free fall. Price data shows that bears have been in control after prices soared to as high as $21 in February, forcing the coin down by over 80%. At spot rates, the coin remains under intense selling pressure. If anything, sellers could unwind all progress made after listing on Binance in early November. Related Reading: XRP Price Stalls in Range: Will a Breakout Come Soon? The immediate concern is the upcoming token unlock set for October 30. Usually, token unlocks are considered bearish due to the expected spike in supply.

By next year, Token Unlocks, a monitoring platform, projects that TIA’s supply will be up by nearly 4X.
