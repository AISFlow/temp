42387067,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWcGr,1623714991,"Human Protocol Expands hCaptcha Tool, Launches Wallet to Make AI Smarter","Human Protocol has launched a tool that lets developers plug its “Proof-of-HUMANity” feature into cryptocurrency wallets.      By using Human’s hCaptcha – the anti-bot feature on websites that you may know as that thing that forces you to identify fire hydrants in a picture grid – developers can ensure transactions on their networks are executed by humans. The hCaptcha tool can be introduced to the design of third-party wallet plug-ins for web browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Brave.      With the boom in decentralized finance (DeFi), front-running bots have increasingly become an issue. The bots are known to cut in line in an execution queue, right before a known future transaction occurs, in order to capitalize on a price change.    Read more: Ethereum Trading Bot Strategy ‘Extracted’ $107M in 30 Days, Research Suggests    Human’s bot-buster is an independent and more private alternative to Google’s reCAPTCHA, which is used by the majority of the web.      “Proof-of-HUMANity is a gamechanger for the blockchain industry, which has long been plagued by nefarious bot activity,” Alex Newman, Human’s hCaptcha co-founder, said in a statement.      The tool not only boosts know-your-customer capabilities, he said, but it also can “maintain the integrity of on-chain governance.”      To this end, Human Protocol previously partnered with popular crypto wallet MetaMask and data oracle network Chainlink to give users access to the hCaptcha method (if app developers support it).    But wait ...    In addition to the added “Proof-of-HUMANity” functionality, Human Protocol Labs is releasing a native wallet, the HUMAN wallet, that will serve as the main way to interact with dapps and platforms within the protocol’s orbit.      Essentially it’s a decentralized platform where requesters can crowdsource people to perform tasks that help bolster machine-learning networks. Artificial intelligence is not so good at identifying specific content in a video, so that’s where humans come in. Workers are compensated in the Human’s native token, HMT.      Human’s Lonnie Rae Kurlander said one of aims here is addressing the lack of financial security and recourse when it comes to late or absent payments for workers who’ve completed tasks.      “The goal of Human Protocol is to create a trustless environment for the gig economy, especially when it comes to better incentivizing participation in human intelligence tasks and digital labor platforms,” Kurlander said in an email.    Read more: Protocol Hosting Google reCAPTCHA Competitor Expands to Polkadot    Learning from as many humans as possible will be critical to AI’s development and is vital to training machine-learning algorithms.      The HUMAN Wallet will be used to view jobs as they’re posted, secure the Human network by staking with trusted validators and tap into cross-chain applications.      “The launch of the HUMAN Wallet will enable participation in this new decentralized job market for human intelligence tasks, and the availability of the new Proof-of-HUMANity developer tool will ensure the integrity of participation in blockchain networks,” said Kurlander, adding:    “Together, these systems will enable a trustless and autonomous environment for humans and machines to solve increasingly complex issues relating to data science and machine learning.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | LINK | MARKET | TRADING,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/06/14/human-protocol-expands-hcaptcha-tool-launches-wallet-to-make-ai-smarter,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d98974be03f255317fcbf08ce69a99b5a4ca24e4-1500x877.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin ownership should be “decriminalized,” he said, according to an English translation.      The proposed law change comes after local media reported that a 17-year-old Tunisian boy was arrested in April for using cryptocurrency for an online transaction. The incident caused outrage in Tunisia’s crypto community, with many blaming the arrest on lack of regulatory clarity in Tunisia.      While regulators across Africa seemingly struggle with crypto policy, offering contradictory statements and issuing crackdowns, adoption by African retail users is only speeding up. In an appearance on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” earlier this month, Paxful CEO Ray Youssef said the African continent is leading the world in global cryptocurrency adoption and encouraged the crypto community to “have all eyes on Africa right now.”      At Swiss crypto conference last year, Tunisian central bank governor Marouane el Abassi said regarding bitcoin:    “We are convinced that restraining a technology at its beginnings would be a mistake. … The Central Bank of Tunisia has opted for the strategic choice of positioning itself as a facilitator with the Tunisian innovation ecosystem.”    But regardless of statements, efforts to get crypto-friendly laws on the books in Tunisia have languished, resulting in events like April’s arrest.      Even without regulatory clarity, crypto adoption in Tunisia is growing at a record pace.

The BIS published a survey examining the possible cross-border use of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) based on 50 central banks. While BIS did not disclose which banks replied to the survey, it says that 18 were in advanced economies and 32 in emerging-market and developing economies (EMDE). About two-thirds of them are already experimenting with CBDC and conducting pilots, the BIS said.      “A number of central banks are open to allowing tourists and other non-residents to use CBDCs within their own jurisdiction,” BIS wrote, reiterating that “a CBDC could function as a means of payment for tourists to a currency zone or even entire countries outside it.”    Read more: BIS Researchers Grapple With Implications of Interoperable CBDCs    While many banks are still concerned about volatility in exchange rates, especially “if flows between domestic currency and a foreign CBDC were to be disorderly,” 28% told the BIS they would be interested in forming multi-CBDC (mCBDC) arrangements to build a single payment system.      “Central banks are considering a variety of mCBDC arrangements. Some central banks are even contemplating multiple CBDCs run on a single system,” BIS wrote.      One of the biggest concerns among banks, particularly those in EMDEs, are economic and monetary implications. For example, “digital dollarization,” which refers to the risk of a foreign CBDC replacing the domestic currency in payments and financial transactions.

42406580,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAevEDR,1623705659,The Age of Autonomous Supply Chains,"We associate the concept of central planning with grim images of collapsing Soviet economies, but it turns out that central planning is also the main engine for how capitalist modern economies run – at least inside the enterprise, though with perhaps a slightly better track record.      It turns out, whether it’s at the national level or inside the enterprise, that people do not like being told what to do or being guided by central planning. Despite that, since the 1960s, companies have been trying to make computerized top-down planning and scheduling work so that they can operate their business networks more efficiently.    Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.    These central planning systems are costly and complex, and with the rise of blockchain-based industrial operations, there is an opportunity to put many of them out to pasture. Just like the real world, blockchains are decentralized systems where individual actors participate alongside others, but there is no centralized coordinating entity.      In the place of top-down inventory planning and forecasting, smart contracts could be used to allow decentralized operations. Stores or locations that run out of inventory can then look around for potential suppliers – checking on the cost of buying replacement inventory from nearby stores, distributors or directly from the factory. Each local participant needs to focus only on setting their own rules to manage their replenishment plans and forecast.      Crowdsourced services like ride sharing already do something like that. None of them directly tells drivers when to drive (or riders when to ride). Instead, they allow some form of supply and demand matching to occur directly in the market. Current systems are still highly centralized, with a lot of analytics and tools being used to nudge drivers and riders toward an equilibrium with things like bonuses and surge pricing. It is less hands-on than centralized planning, but still far from an entirely free market.    Crowdsourced services like ride sharing already do something like this    These types of systems are still much more responsive than central planning systems, although that’s a low bar to hurdle. Planning has always been tough, and the gradual evolution of the process has taken decades. In the process, you take the material plan for a product and then backwards calculate how many should be ordered based on your production schedule. The result is, in theory, an orderly sequence of purchases that will refill your stocks in a timely manner. Once products are built, a separate plan, often known as the distribution plan, pushes them out into the sales channel.      The theory sounds good. In reality, most enterprise supply chains are a dumpster fire of panic drills and frantic fulfillment efforts. No plan ever survives contact with reality and just about anything can go wrong, from errors in product design to giant container ships getting stuck in the Suez Canal. I once met an executive who supervised a network of private jets focused primarily on emergency supply chain runs. While spending $100,000 to ship $10,000 in plastic door handles might seem ridiculous, it’s cheaper than idling a $1 billion factory or making several thousand cars without door handles and then having staff manually attach them later. And all that has happened before we’ve dealt with sudden changes in supply or demand.      Given all the things that can go wrong, the most successful companies make the coordination of business operations a strategic priority for their top executives and are very hands-on in managing the details of the supply chain. Early on in my career, I worked at a supply chain planning software vendor, and had the opportunity to watch the CEO of a major technology company preside over its sales and operations planning meeting.    Read more: Paul Brody: The Future of Everything Is Free    I was invited to attend the planning meeting as an observer to inform my work in process and system design. Once there, I was amazed to watch the CEO personally engage in the process. A shortage of parts from a key supplier meant that the company’s high end (and high margin) products that were key to the holiday season would be in short supply, and while that was far from ideal, there was still available capacity to increase production of the company’s lower margin products.      In that meeting, they agreed to ramp up production of the lower margin items and change the advertising and sales emphasis to the products they would have in stock, not the ones they originally planned. The agility they showed in the planning process probably made the very best of a bad situation. That meeting set a benchmark of CEO-level engagement in supply chain management that I have never yet seen equaled.      Although there aren’t yet any models for autonomous and decentralized supply chain planning, there is at least one centralized method that comes close, and it works very well: The Kanban system was originally developed by Toyota and executed in the early days without any software at all. Like many great ideas, the system is a perfect encapsulation of the philosophy that less can sometimes be more. Kanban systems eschew advanced planning software for physical cards. When inventory runs low (or out), a card is sent to the next level back in the supply chain requesting replenishment. Without regard to some grand plan, inventory flows through the system by a set of pull signals.      The best feature of the Kanban system is that the “planning” signal comes all the way from the marketplace and the network responds to the demand signal directly, rather than pushing products forward based on a plan. Kanban systems are simple and efficient, and work well both in paper and digital versions.      There remain significant limitations on these kinds of systems. They do not work well in “build-to-order” environments, where every product is customized or where there are frequent engineering changes. There are also big challenges for centralized systems. Want to make a supply chain planner cry? Tell them you have an engineering change order coming.    Read more: Paul Brody: A Big Carbon Footprint Compared to What?    For many cases, though, a blockchain-based autonomous supply chain network would bring big benefits. Smart contracts would be free to look at supply not just from the warehouse or factory, but perhaps also from nearby stores and other sources. Local smart contracts could get even smarter over time, developing unique, localized historical data of demand and an understanding of how to balance difference supply sources in time and money.      To get to this future state, we still need to make dramatic progress in our ability to tokenize digital assets as they move through the supply chain. This data exists today, but it is rarely packaged in the form of digital tokens that can be seen and managed by smart contracts. As blockchain transaction capacity rises and more companies move their procurement and traceability activities on-chain, adding planning and shifting toward self-organizing networks looks more and more feasible.      The future of planning is the rise of self-organizing systems over top-down planning. From ride sharing to vacation homes, we are already experiencing how systems that are driven by individual entities can be as responsive and effective as top-down models. It is only a matter of time before this approach moves into the industrial supply chain.

42406598,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAevEQE,1623703334,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Sustains 'Musk Jump' as Crypto Sentiment Improves,"A string of positive news kept bitcoin buyers active on Monday as analysts searched for signs of a short-term bottom. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is up about 20% over the past e seven days and is testing the $40,000 price level for the first time in two weeks.      A number of signals “all firmly point to an undervalued bitcoin at current prices,” wrote Alexandra Clark, sales trader at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, in an email to CoinDesk.      Buyers stepped in after Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted on Sunday the electric car maker would allow bitcoin transactions again ""when there's confirmation of reasonable (50%) clean energy usage by miners with a positive future trend.""      “Although many analysts are still on the fence when it comes to determining whether the digital asset is ready to continue its uptrend,"" Clark wrote, ""what we do know is that Musk is responsible.”      The tweet triggered a near-6% bounce in BTC, which had been trading in a tight trading range between $30,000 and $40,000 over the past month.    Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC) $39,738 +2.8%  Ether (ETH) $2,537 +2.5%  Buyers go 'all in' onbitcoin    Traders also reacted to hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones’ assertion he could “go all in on the inflation trades,” during an interview with CNBC on Monday. Jones said he “likes bitcoin” and wants a 5% allocation of it with the same percentage in gold, cash and commodities.      MicroStrategy is also in the news again, preparing to buy up to $488 million in bitcoin with the proceeds of a $500 million bond sale that closed on Monday. MicroStrategy’s stock (Nasdaq: MSTR) jumped about 14% on Monday and is up about 30% year to date, roughly in line with bitcoin's price gains.      Overall, sentiment appears to be shifting to the positive following a volatile May. In fact, 87% of investors surveyed by cryptocurrency brokerage firm Voyager plan to increase their bitcoin or other crypto holdings over the next quarter.      “It’s encouraging that investors remain bullish following the recent market correction as we continue to see some interesting trends in our user sentiment surveys,” wrote Steve Ehrlich, CEO of Voyager, in an email to CoinDesk.      However, uncertainty regarding bitcoin as an asset class still lingers, which could weigh on sentiment.      Goldman Sachs' consumer and wealth management division published a report on Monday stating crypto is ""not a viable investment."" The bank doesn't recommend it for client portfolios.    Bitcoin options market shows demand for downside hedges    Investors have shown lingering fears of further drop in bitcoin prices and continued demand for downside hedges, as seen in the cryptocurrency’s “options smile.”      Options smile, a U-shaped graph resembling a smiley emoticon, is created by plotting implied volatilities against options at various strike prices expiring on the same date.      The ""smile"" shows relatively higher implied volatility or demand for options at strikes below bitcoin’s current market price than the implied volatility for higher strikes options.    Bitcoin deviates from 11-year trend    Bitcoin is trading about 36% below its 11-year exponential trend, according to a report published on Monday by Pantera Capital.      The recent peak that preceded the May sell-off was just a touch over trend value. Bitcoin has only spent about 20% of its history far under trend valuation, according to Pantera.      The deviation from trend could have further room to decline compared to prior lows seen in 2012 and 2020, although bitcoin does not appear overvalued relative to historical extremes.    Cycle check: Where to from here?    A research report published by Enigma Securities last week suggested bitcoin's price could head sideways for a while but may face further downside when compared with previous bear markets in 2013 and 2017.      “Under no circumstances do we expect a quick recovery. It is, however, conceivable that we see a quicker recovery,” the report writes.      The bear market for bitcoin in 2017 was no less severe than 2013, but was shorter, according to Enigma.    Bitcoin poised to outperform ether    Investors could be warming up to the world’s top cryptocurrency again as technicals show bitcoin is beginning to outperform ether.      The BTC/ETH ratio is now above the 50-day moving average, which could point to improving relative strength of bitcoin versus ether, according to Katie Stockton, managing director of Fairlead Strategies.    Goldman Sachs Plans to Offer Ether Options: Report    Goldman Sachs plans to offer investors options and futures trading in ether, according to a report on Monday.    The investment bank plans to offer ether trading in the months ahead, Mathew McDermott, head of digital assets at Goldman Sachs, told Bloomberg.  McDermott said clients see the recent rout as a good entry point and that the bank also plans to facilitate trades with exchange-traded notes that track ether.  In May, CoinDesk reported Goldman Sachs had started to offer investors access to non-deliverable forwards (NDFs), a derivative tied to bitcoin’s price that pays out in cash.  Technical analysis    Price charts for bitcoin and ether might be turning bullish after a month of market stagnation, potentially offering respite in the coming weeks, a new analysis shows.    Bitcoin's weekly stochastic oscillator has turned up from an oversold level or below 20, signaling the possibility of a near-term ""relief rally,"" according to Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies.  Seasoned traders use the oscillator in conjunction with other indicators to gauge oversold and overbought conditions, which act as triggers for long and short trade entries. A reading below 20 implies oversold conditions, while an above-80 print indicates an overbought market.  Thus, bitcoin appears poised for a more substantial relief rally – a price bounce due to seller exhaustion. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at 2.5-week highs above $40,000, representing an 8% gain on a 24-hour basis.  According to Stockton, an initial resistance for bitcoin is near $47,000, which, if breached, would open the doors for further gains. However, Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, expects fresh sellers to step in above $45,000.

The report obtained by CoinDesk Monday cited a couple of reasons for pessimism, including the high energy consumption of mining and the possibility of technological advances such as quantum computing making current blockchain technology obsolete and the risk of greater regulatory oversight hampering crypto's status as a speculative asset.  The scarcity of regulated exchanges has also contributed to a paucity of available data on crypto assets. The data is ""improving,"" though still ""poor,"" the report stated.

42406582,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAevEIM,1623694738,4 Crypto Tax Tips to Get You Through Market Dips,"As crypto has taken off over the past few years, we’ve seen drastic ups and downs in the market. When you’ve invested money into cryptocurrencies, seeing the prices dip can undoubtedly trigger panic. Do you HODL for dear life? Buy the dip? Cut your losses?      As it turns out, the market dips can actually be a positive when it comes to crypto and taxes. It’s merely a matter of moving when the market moves with a strategy called tax-loss harvesting. The concept is simple: Sell your crypto assets when in loss positions to offset your capital gains.    Michelle O’Connor is VP of Marketing at TaxBit, which provides cryptocurrency tax automation software to enterprises, consumers and government entities.    Crypto traders who take advantage of tax-loss harvesting can potentially save hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars on their taxes. Once you understand how to move with the market, you won’t hodl through those dips again.    What is crypto tax-loss harvesting?    Crypto tax-loss harvesting is the selling of cryptocurrency assets that are in loss positions to offset capital gains. Since every sale or trade of an appreciated asset triggers a taxable capital gain, many crypto traders find themselves owing a rather large sum of money in taxes at the end of the year. These taxable capital gains can be offset with strategic capital losses, which is exactly what tax-loss harvesting does.    How can you use tax-loss harvesting to minimize your crypto taxes?    Crypto tax-loss harvesting, when done right, can not only lower your tax liability, but in some cases, it can actually help you get a tax refund. To use tax-loss harvesting to the fullest extent, keep these tips in mind:    1. Take advantage of no wash-sale rules in cryptocurrency.    Wash-sale rules prevent a taxpayer from selling a security at a loss and buying back the same asset within 30 days. The good news for cryptocurrency traders is that wash-sale rules don’t currently apply to crypto. When the market dips, you can sell your assets at a loss and buy them back to offset your capital gains.    Read more: Seth Wilks: How to File Your Crypto Taxes (and Not Get Screwed)  2. Harvest your losses year-round, not just at the end of the year.    Many people choose to harvest their losses only once a year at the end of the year. When it seems clear that an asset isn't going to show a profit before the year ends, then they'll consider harvesting the loss for tax purposes.      However, with crypto’s wild price swings throughout the year, that strategy leaves money on the table. Instead, take advantage of the price dips throughout the year, and you’ll reap much greater tax savings.    3. Deduct any remaining capital losses from your ordinary income.    If you have capital losses left over after netting them against your capital gains for the year, you can deduct up to $3,000 of them from your ordinary income. And, any additional losses beyond that can be carried over to future tax years to offset capital gains. This is a great way to rake in even more savings, since ordinary income tax rates can be as high as 37%.    Read more: Crypto Tax 2021: A Complete US Guide  4. Pay attention to the holding period of the assets you are tax-loss harvesting.    Keep in mind that while tax-loss harvesting allows you to strategically defer and lessen your crypto taxes, it doesn’t allow you to skip out on taxes altogether. For this reason, it’s important to remember that long-term capital gains are taxed at a more favorable rate than short term capital gains. If you have both long- and short-term capital gains of a certain cryptocurrency, it is more beneficial to first harvest the short-term capital losses and offset your short-term gains. You may consider holding on to your long-term capital gains to get a more favorable tax rate when you do decide to sell.      It’s also important to note that you are only allowed to offset long-term capital losses against long-term capital gains and short-term capital losses against short-term capital gains. After you’ve offset losses of the same type, you can use either long-term or short-term capital losses against short-term capital gains.      When you properly understand how to use cryptocurrency tax-loss harvesting, you can realize considerably more tax savings than when you hodl. By applying these tips, you’ll be able to use market dips to your advantage, and potentially even get a tax refund.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Michelle O'Connor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/06/14/4-crypto-tax-tips-to-get-you-through-market-dips,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/278f4b4ddc16ef7b295113589ee3451e8b97af77-1206x708.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406584,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAevEFP,1623694131,2 Tweets Make a Story: Bloomberg's Bitcoin Miami Report,"It may in fact turn out that lots of people got COVID-19 at Bitcoin 2021 (June 4-5 in Miami), but even if they did, the first story on the subject was still ill advised.      On Thursday night, Bloomberg filed: ""Miami Bitcoin Gathering Was a Covid Hot Spot, Attendees Say.""    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Did they? There's not much in the story that supports that headline.      The story reflected almost no real reporting on what attendees did or didn't say. The entire thesis was supported by the following bits of information:    Two tweets: One by someone who said he came back COVID-positive and one by someone who said he didn't but knew people who did (no evidence that Bloomberg attempted to verify or substantiate claims)  A statement from the conference organizers saying they tried to encourage safety  An account of what attendees were or weren't doing with regard to masking, presumably an attestation by the two reporters cited on the post.    I guess the standard here is: Bitcoin is weird and our readers don't really like it, so it doesn't actually matter if we try to get the story right. From Bloomberg's account:      ""Bitcoin ... has become a popular and controversial investment, but unlike many normal investments, it has developed a unqiue [sic] culture unto itself marked by a sort of macho, anti[-]authority ethos.""      Another line from the Bloomberg post nearly acknowledges that little could be known about infections in Miami so soon:      ""It’s [sic] wasn’t clear whether the attendees got the disease at the conference itself or at the gatherings.""      Of course, the post hadn't honestly established that many people had gotten COVID-19 there at all. In fact, toward the end, the author admits, ""It remains difficult to pin outbreaks on specific events – and the Bitcoin event probably won’t be an exception.""      The problem with stories like these is that in a competitive environment they put pressure on other news outlets to continue to investigate and poke at a narrative that may create the appearance of a story when there really isn't one. Gizmodo followed with basically the same set of thin facts. CNBC went on to find a couple more tweets.      As the narrative spread like small-town gossip, that pressure reached CoinDesk. Editors here believed the site could not ignore the conversation and had a duty to readers to acknowledge and address it – with appropriate epistemic humility. With extensive contacts within the crypto space, CoinDesk was able to uncover several more testimonies of COVID-19 cases out of Miami but also many testimonies of people who were vaccinated and came back with negative tests.      Since filing that report on Friday, more personal testimonies have come in, mostly of negative tests but also of positive ones. Yes, we have some actual reporting beyond Twitter to our credit, but can we really count it toward a generalizable finding? I still don't think so.

The funding comes as action on Polkadot ramps up in anticipation of the interoperability network’s “parachain” auctions. Auctions for slots on Polkadot’s experimental “canary network,” Kusama, begin this week.    Read more: Polkadot’s Kusama Network to Start Parachain Auctions Next Week    Parallel Finance will run on both Polkadot and Kusama, offering DOT and KSM holders compound staking and zero-collateral, fixed-rate loans for parachain auctions in addition to interest rate swaps and a decentralized credit rating system.      DOT and KSM holders are currently challenged by the competition between lending and staking, Ruan said. If the lending rate is higher than the staking rate, holders have to unstake their tokens to earn yield, hurting network security. If the lending rate is lower than the staking rate, holders will prefer to stake DOT as the higher-yield option.      Ruan said Parallel solves this problem by using a lending protocol that allows holders to borrow cash on top of their staking derivatives.

Startup NFT Genius will be using $4 million it raised in a seed round of funding to build a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace on Dapper Labs’ Flow blockchain, the company said Monday. The round was backed by Dapper Labs CEO Roham Gharegozlou, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, actor Ashton Kutcher and bitcoin advocate Anthony Pompliano.      While NFT Genius is largely focused on music, it also expects to bring NFTs into sports, gaming and even comedy, its press release said. The company is betting that NFTs will remain popular in spite of the recent cooldown in demand in what had been a white-hot market.      NFTs have already begun gaining popularity in the music industry. In March, rapper Post Malone released his second NFT collaboration with concert streaming service Aux Live. Music-related NFTs reportedly topped over $25 million in sales in February alone.      “What NFT Genius is doing that others are not is creating a verticalized destination for interactive experiences and meaningful virtual connections,” Cuban said in a statement.    Digital ‘fanfic’    Cuban compared the appeal of NFTs to “the phenomenon of fanfiction,” where superfans craft their own works related to their favorite books or movies. It’s an internet-era twist on the relationship between creator and consumer.      That relationship is at the core of the company's vision, said NFT Genius CEO and co-founder Jeremy Born. He cited the music industry as an example of a business that can be revolutionized with the storytelling capabilities of NFTs.      “The industry has been transformed into something about streaming. It’s all about how many plays, how many eyes, how many downloads you have,” Born told CoinDesk in an interview. “Artists are forced into this specific cookie cutter mold to succeed. Back in the older days, music was all about collectibility. I think that NFTs bring back that collectibility aspect to the industry, and allow artists to more creatively connect with their audience.”      Read more: Kings of Leon to Release New Album as NFT With Tokenized Tickets for Superfans      The NFT Genius marketplace is still under production, but the company did release a Bitcoin-themed NFT collection in the fall of 2020. The collection allowed users to experience the story of Bitcoin’s creation through a cross-platform treasure hunt for a prize of 1 BTC.      While few have an idea of what exactly the future of the NFT industry will look like, NFT Genius is betting on immersive experiences.      “The experiential side of things, and how deep you can dive into [NFTs], and connect with the fan, that’s for us the key.

42406594,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAevEPF,1623673851,Bitcoin 'Options Smile' Shows Market Fearful of Downside Despite Tesla News,"Bitcoin has put in a positive performance in the past 24 hours on comments by Tesla CEO Elon Musk that the electric car maker would accept crypto transactions on the condition of reasonable clean energy use by miners.      Still, the move to 2.5-week highs above $39,000 has failed to calm market fears. That's evident from a chart pattern known as the ""options smile,"" which shows relatively higher implied volatility or demand for options at strikes below bitcoin's current market price than the implied volatility for higher strikes options.      The unique structure speaks of extreme fears and continued demand for downside hedges, as tweeted by trader and analyst Alex Kruger. In plain English, investors continue to buy puts in anticipation of a more profound price decline.      Options smile, a U-shaped graph resembling a smiley emoticon, is created by plotting implied volatilities against options at various strike prices expiring on the same date. Implied volatility is investors' expectations of price turbulence over a specific period. A higher implied volatility results from greater demand for options and vice versa.      Options are hedging instruments that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option represents the right to buy and put the right to sell.      Options smile for the June 15 and June 18 expiries charted by analytics platform Genesis Volatility is quite steep at strikes well below bitcoin's current price and relatively flat on the higher side. The subsequent expiries due on June 25, July 2 and July 30 exhibit similar structures.      The steeper slope at lower strikes reflects fears of a sell-off and the flatter slope at the right end shows market participants expect rallies, if any, to be gradual.      One may argue that the steeper slope at lower strikes could be stemming from increased demand for call options or bullish bets than for protective puts. However, put-call skews, which measure the cost of puts relative to calls, suggest otherwise.      The one-week, one- and three-month put-call skews remain entrenched in the positive territory, implying stronger demand for short- and near-term puts. Had the market participants been buying in-the-money calls, or even higher strike (out-of-the-money) calls in large numbers, the put-call skews would have been negative.      Deep-in-the-money calls – ones at strikes well below the spot – are relatively costly and eliminate the low risk-high reward advantage provided by calls at higher strikes. As such, in calls, hedging/trading activity is almost always concentrated at strikes just below the spot price, near the spot price and above the spot price, while in the case of puts, activity is mostly seen in strikes near and below the spot price. That seems to be the case with bitcoin as well.      Data from dominant exchange Deribit tracked by the Swiss-based Laevitas platform shows a relatively high concentration of open interest (number of open positions) in out-of-the-money and at-the-money calls and lower strike puts.      While the market remains cautious for the short term, the longer-term bias looks bullish. The volatility smile for the Dec. 31 expiry options carries a steep slope for higher strikes.

Monetary policy in the country is governed by the European Central Bank, and therefore a unilateral ban in a single eurozone state would have limited effect.  Monitoring and supervising cryptocurrency would be preferable: ""My observation is now that that is more effective than a total ban in the Netherlands,"" Hoekstra said.

Of 60 exchanges in the country, only four are using real-name accounts that meet this standard, according to the Korea Times.  This latest statement of intent by the FSC around stricter regulation of the crypto industry comes as exchanges have until Sept. 24 of this year to register as virtual-asset service providers (VASPs) for the regulator to then assess the legality of their operations.

42406558,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAevAYA,1623659248,Bitcoin Tops $40K as Musk Says Tesla May Accept Crypto in Future,"Bitcoin surged past $40,000 for the first time in two weeks after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the electric-car maker would accept the cryptocurrency as an alternative payment subject to miners meeting environmental standards.    The bitcoin price was $40,187 as of 13:09 coordinated universal time (9:11 a.m. ET), up 12% over the past 2 hours, according to CoinDesk 20 data.  Buyers stepped in on Sunday after Musk tweeted that Tesla will allow bitcoin transactions again ""when there's confirmation of reasonable (50%) clean energy usage by miners with a positive future trend.""  ""Musk's latest tweet is net positive for bitcoin because it not only gives a benchmark for Tesla to deem the cryptocurrency carbon neutral, but it will force mining groups to publicize information, therefore making the entire mining operations more transparent and environmental, social and governance friendly,"" Nick Mancini, a research analyst at Trade the Chain, said.  ""It will put the juice to the upside,"" Brian Tehako, executive director of Trading Desk Operations at the digital-assets market maker Hehmeyer, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""Our five-day simple moving average crossed through the 20-day average [a bullish development]. The market could rise to $41,900.""  The widely tracked 200-day simple moving average (SMA) resistance is currently located at $42,484, according to technical analysis data source TradingView.  Tesla announced bitcoin as a payment option in February, only to suspend it early May on environmental concerns.  While the market mood has improved in the past 24 hours, caution ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve rate decision, due Wednesday, may keep gains in check.  The Fed's liquidity-boosting monetary policy has come under fire in recent weeks, with former central bank officials, economists and market participants calling it inappropriate amid inflation concerns.  ""Rather ironic to live whining about the Fed, yet without the Fed and its expansionary policies, the price of bitcoin would be 90% lower,"" trader and analyst Alex Kruger tweeted.
