42398871,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh7Fn,1454955714,Inside Earthport's Bid to Push Banks Past Blockchain R&D,"Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) are often branded as disruptors – upstart technologies that aim to 'eat the lunch' of financial incumbents.  As with most generalities, however, this idea falls apart upon observation. Startups are not the only entities researching the opportunities technology could unlock and entering the now-burgeoning market for blockchain solutions – established companies are entering the space, too.  For example, London-based Earthport, an Internet payment infrastructure provider founded in 1997, is already choosing to embrace DLT technology by adding it to existing product lines. The cross-border payments specialist is now using the Ripple protocol as part of a new solution that yields insight into the problems major banks are facing in bringing their tech out of the lab and to the market.  In a new interview, Earthport’s Daniel Marovitz – the firm's in-house blockchain expert and president of its European division – explains that the firm's new Distributed Ledger Payments Hub is a result of its belief that the technology could improve on or complement its existing services, and that technology itself is secondary to providing a better service to clients.  ""The traditional correspondent rails are just not fit for purpose. No one wants to spend $40 to move $50,"" Marovitz said. ""When we got into DLT, we viewed it as an organic continuance of the same theme. This is a new payments rail we can deliver through the same API.""  The company, which already connects banks and payment aggregators, has identified deficiencies with current offerings – for example, that ""traditional correspondent banking” is too slow, and that the need to wait three days for funds has caused “customer frustration"".  With this in mind, Earthport is venturing to test its market hypothesis, launching its DLT service complete with the kind of brochures you’d expect from a company with mature business lines.  To Marovitz, Earthport can use distributed ledger technology to tap a potentially lucrative market: Financial institutions that have heard about the benefits of blockchain, but are uncertain about what steps to take or how to integrate it into their services.  Marovitz told CoinDesk:  ""The conversation goes like this. You talk to a major bank and they say they are interested in DLT. You ask, 'Well, are you doing anything about it?' [They say], well we’ve got an innovation lab, we’ve got Ripple and Ethereum running. [We ask] ‘Have you figured out how to take that beta and turn it into a production system?’ We get a blank stare and awkwardly mumbled words.""  Missing link  Marovitz believes there are two reasons financial institutions aren’t taking their products out of the labs – fear of the unknown and compliance.  ""They see the vast majority of central banks and regulators are quiet [about blockchain]. The banks are terrified that as promising as it seems, they’re going to get into trouble,"" Marovitz added.  To this end, Marovitz sees the Distributed Ledger Payments Hub as a missing link – a product that can capitalize on the established trust able to delivered by a company that has a history connecting banks to payment technologies.  Earthport quite simply sees value in serving as a business and compliance layer built on top of a nascent technology, performing data collection for know-your-customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML) and politically exposed persons (PEP) screening.  Earthport doesn't see these services as competitive to Ripple, but complementary to its tech-first approach to the market.  ""Ripple has no intention of running those kinds of pieces. They want to manage the ledger and the crypto complexity,"" Marovitz said.  Appetite for DLT  Earthport provides three models for how banks and financial intuitions can use its DLT service depending on their comfort level with interacting with the Ripple protocol.  For starters, it offers to integrate a client directly with Ripple. In this instance, the client would set up a Ripple wallet, host its own ""DL server"" and initiate payment directly via the Ripple protocol.  The level of assistance provided increases from there.  When acting as a ""distributed ledger service bureau"", Earthport agrees to host the server that will connect to the protocol and initiate any fund transfer via its API.  The firm is also offering to ""indirectly"" connect clients to Ripple, with Earthport even owning the wallet under this third option.  As an added upsell, Earthport boasts that users don’t have to interact with market makers on the Ripple network at all. Earthport’s marketing materials tout that the company approves and screens market makers that can then acquire and offload the necessary XRP (the native token on the Ripple network) to transfer the value from one currency to another.  If only one party is ""Ripple enabled"", Earthport says, the transaction is then completed via traditional rails, but with improved overall efficiency.  Still, Marovitz says the company is seeing some interest and has reasons to believe ""all its partner banks"" will integrate the technology, as its FAQ sheet on the subject suggests.  ""There are 10 to 15 banks that want to initiate proof of concepts (POCs) with us, and we hope to have a European bank in a POC with us now,"" Marovitz added.  Bitcoin under the bus  A clear theme is also evident from Earthport’s approach, in that its sales literature actively distances the product from bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.  The materials read:  ""Although the distributed ledger model serves as the support layer, or protocol on which cryptocurrencies (bitcoin, 'dogecoin', 'litecoin', etc) function, these cryptocurrencies are not used in any capacity related to the Earthport DL Gateway.""  This is despite the fact that the product uses XRP, which, though branded differently due to the Ripple network's use of trusted transaction validators, is a publicly traded cryptographic token that runs on a blockchain-like system.  In sections related to market makers, the text hints that the Ripple network requires a publicly traded asset, but softens the language.  ""There are currently 45 institutions that are market makers, meaning that they run auctions to determine the ask/bid rate for a transaction in a given set of currencies,"" it reads.  Marovitz attests that Earthport intends to expand the number of blockchains it offers access to as the product matures, but as for whether the bitcoin blockchain could become one of those options, the company suggests it believes this is unlikely.  On the subject of whether the offering is ""related to bitcoin"", the marketing material is blunt, providing only a two-word response:  ""Absolutely not.""

42398860,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh73z,1454951491,Bitcoin Group Stock Exchange Debut Delayed Again,"Bitcoin Group Ltd has once again delayed its public listing on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), despite its recent initial public offering.  The Melbourne-based bitcoin mining firm first announced its intention to list on the ASX in October 2014. However, it has now suffered as many as six hold-ups due to requests and reprimands from the stock exchange.  The latest news came by way of a Bitcoin Group investors' update on 5th February, which said:  “Investors will appreciate that ‘block chain’ is a new technology and we are working with ASX to satisfy its request for additional information as part of the listing application process.""  The company said that it would provide additional updates in the future regarding when the stock would begin to float on the open market.  Lackluster IPO  Following final revisions to Bitcoin Group's filing in December, the ASX allowed the IPO to go ahead on 25th January.  Yet the IPO fell short of expectations. The firm raised just $AU5.9 million, below the AU$20 million it had hoped to obtain.  Providing it meets the ASX's requirements, the firm is still on track to become the second bitcoin firm on Australia's largest stock exchange, following digitalBTC's listing in 2014.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/02/08/bitcoin-group-stock-exchange-debut-delayed-again,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f5f1e7dc958d245aaaccd98332f35968e6fb16a9-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398867,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh7Br,1454942416,Five UK Mutual Funds Partner on Blockchain Trading Project,"Five major British mutual fund operators have partnered to explore blockchain technology's cost saving potential in trading systems.  As reported in the Financial Times, Schroders Investment Management and Aberdeen Asset Management have initiated the project, along with Columbia Threadneedle Investments. Aviva Investors and Henderson Global Investors are also said to be involved in talks about the initiative.  Together the funds – which manage over £1tn ($1.44tn) in assets – are exploring the possibility that blockchain or distributed ledger tech can save billions by removing intermediaries and reducing manual processing of trades, which can take days to complete with current systems.  According to the FT, the firms are looking into various applications for the technology, including the direct trading of illiquid securities.  Financial institutions have been coming together in numbers over the last year to explore the possibilities of blockchains, joining consortia such as R3, which now has over 40 banks on board. However, this would seem to be the first time in which fund houses have come together to investigate the technology.
