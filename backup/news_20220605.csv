42421561,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoclZ,1654472108,The Meme Economy,"Cryptocurrency is a meme.  Currency has always been structured around fundamentals, whether it be precious metals, governmental powers or advantage in commerce. The reduction of major currencies to untethered fiat currencies has brought about a transformative reaction in the form of cryptocurrency.  While many declare the value of crypto lies in a set of complex technologies, in fact the value – like all value – is entirely memetic.  Chris Gabriel is the host of MemeAnalysis, a YouTube channel that parses the meanings of internet memes, trends and philosophies. He will speak on the Big Ideas stage at Consensus 2022 in Austin, Texas next week. Follow him on Twitter: @thegoddisk. Register for Consensus 2022 here.  “Meme” is a difficult word for many, because it has been inextricably linked with “internet jokes,” but memes are in fact units of cultural transmission, or as the writer William S. Burroughs put it, word and image viruses. Memes are reproduced endlessly through culture.  Read More: Investing in Meme Coins? 3 Things Every Crypto Trader Should Know  Consider “physical” memes like the peace sign or middle finger, “mental” memes like good and evil, and “world-building” memes like the state. These all began as ideas, which “caught on” and reproduced themselves through culture.  All currencies have been built on memetics, but crypto is now the closest to the source; it often does not pretend to have a material basis.  In essence, crypto rises and falls with belief, with vibe. While that has made crypto extremely volatile, with huge price surges and crashes, few have grasped the logic behind these shifts.  Dogecoin, celebrities and memes  Dogecoin (DOGE) is the most vital “meme coin,” declaring no value other than its link to the popular meme of a Shina Ibu dog. Through the popularity of the meme, the memetic spread bolstered by celebrities, DOGE skyrocketed from a minuscule fraction of a cent for most of its history to a high of 74 cents during the pandemic. It’s down to pennies again. While Elon Musk’s seeming endorsement might have pumped the price for a time, association with the billionaire muddied the meme’s character, hurting its value over the long term.  While the meteoric rise of various cryptocurrencies has been attributed to a multitude of factors, the most essential is memetic virulence.  Those who can grasp the memetic nature of not only crypto, but all value, can gain immense power by reading these natural flows of meaning. To do this, one must build a symbolic understanding, as symbols are the radicles of meaning. The field of meme analysis posits memetics as an essentially psychoanalytic pursuit: to grasp the unconscious significance of images, symbols and phrases and to trace their libidinal flows.  Read More: The Psychology of Meme Coins, From Actual Investors  Meme analysis offers a unique insight into memetics, avoiding popular political and economic modalities and aiming for unconscious meaning, stripped of superficial morals and biases. The irrational unconscious doesn’t trade in logics and manufactured systems, but solely in spontaneous energetics.  Economists have failed to make sense of these irrational processes, building their own esoteric methods while ignoring the archetypal patterns at play. J.P. Morgan (the tycoon, not the bank he founded) put it best: “Millionaires don’t use astrology, billionaires do.”  Just as the ancient Chinese believed that observing natural cosmic processes would illuminate human processes, Western occultists structured cosmic systems for understanding man. Though these are often derided as pseudosciences, that critique has been leveled at economics as well. In truth, both are grappling with fundamentally irrational processes that defy simple laws, making the esoteric a necessity.  Investors must be cognizant of this essential instability. Treating investment like a computer program works in a relatively stable market, but the volatility of crypto defies such shoehorning.  The French writer Georges Bataille declared, “tragedy is the impotence of reason,” perfectly illustrating the inherent inadequacy of rational analysis. A rational analysis of irrational processes is bound to fail.  NFTs, memes and the irrationality of markets  This is where psychoanalysis and occultism come into play. Both grapple with the irrational through the mechanisms of the irrational: symbols and language, which is to say memes. The formulation of a memetic approach to economics is a necessity, especially in regard to cryptocurrency, the most volatile market – and the most mimetic.  This approach is ideal for the creators and entrepreneurs in the crypto world as well. By leaving behind traditional approaches to fundamental problems, they enter a new, darkened world that must be illuminated with new light, not borrowed from the systems they are working to overcome. Cryptocurrency can be made less fragile through conducive and consistent memetic branding. Things like potent colors, symbols and motifs can make or break a burgeoning power.  Read More: Jeff Koons’ First NFT Project Is a Riff on Crypto’s ‘Moon’ Meme  The inconsistent adoption of crypto endeavors has been a notable aspect of this new field: Some projects explode in popularity while others never make their first step. This has been illustrated perfectly in the non-fungible token (NFT) market, where some low-quality projects can make millions, while others make nothing. Ironically, the ugliness of some popular NFTs is precisely what makes them memetic, while the beauty of others is entirely mundane.  A study of memetics is a study of virulence. What makes art popular? Why do businesses succeed? Rational answers to these questions are constantly offered. Their success is linked to established fundamentals. But sometimes meteoric popularity can’t be explained in rational terms. It can appear as if failure and success are totally random, or at best fated.  To understand the volatility of this world, we must see the world as the ancients did: a playground for immense inhuman energies that we understand as symbols and what can now be called memes.

42421558,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXociT,1654459720,The Intelligent Crypto Thesis,"“Software is eating the world” has become one of the iconic phrases of the last decade of the software industry. Quoted in 2011 by software legend and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, it synthesized the idea that companies that operated mostly in the physical world were transitioning to the digital economy in a trend that will essentially transform every company into a software company.  Jesus Rodriguez is CEO of IntoTheBlock, a blockchain and cryptocurrency market analysis firm. This article is a preview of a talk he will give this week on the Big Ideas stage at Consensus 2022 in Austin, Texas.  In recent years, the evolution of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) has permeated all areas of the software industry, leading many experts to claim that “machine learning is eating software.” Crypto and digital assets are rooted on the foundation of code and programmability and, consequently, are likely to be influenced by ML-AI trends. The intersection of ML-AI with digital assets is likely to usher in a new era in which intelligence becomes a native component of crypto assets.  The idea of intelligent crypto assets is conceptually trivial but full of practical challenges. What are some of the fundamental ML trends that can rapidly impact the next generation of crypto assets? What are the main scenarios that can benefit from intelligence capabilities in crypto or some of the key technical challenges that need to be overcome for crypto to become intelligent? This essay explores some of these ideas and develops a thesis about the potential of the intersection of crypto and ML.  Only crypto can be natively intelligent  An important point to realize when thinking about AI-ML in the context of crypto assets is that crypto is the only asset class in history that has the potential to become natively intelligent. AI-ML capabilities in traditional asset classes, such as commodities or equities, are implemented in vehicles like robo-advisors or quant strategies that live outside the asset itself. Even though there is an obvious role for those vehicles in the crypto space, crypto assets can natively embed those AI-ML capabilities in the assets. This benefit is, obviously, a side effect of the programmable and digital capabilities of crypto. Crypto assets are based on code and that code could take the form of AI-ML models.  Machine learning will eat crypto, but how?  AI-ML is likely to play an important role in the next decade of the crypto market. While the initial phases of crypto have centered around digitization and automation, the next iteration seems to be destined to be focused on intelligence. There are plenty of applications of AI-ML in crypto today, but we can’t claim that crypto assets are inherently intelligent. In the near future, we should expect to see crypto assets and protocols start to incorporate AI-ML as native capabilities that will allow them to learn and adapt their behavior based on their surrounding environment or markets.  The inevitability of digital assets becoming intelligent is partly dictated from the astonishing evolution of AI-ML technologies in the last few years. In the context of crypto, we shouldn’t think about AI-ML as a generic thing but rather as a group of interrelated types of methods. From that perspective, there are a small number of AI-ML schools that seem particularly well suited for applications in the crypto space. Let’s explore some of the most popular techniques through the lens of their potential within crypto technologies.  Transformers  Considered by many the most important evolution of the last decade of AI-ML, transformers are behind the revolution in natural language understanding (NLU) and are making inroads in other areas, such as computer vision. Models like OpenAI’s GPT-3 or Nvidia’s Megatron are able to generate synthetic texts indistinguishable from those written by humans, engage in highly complex question-answer interactions or even exhibit reasoning capabilities over textual forms. Models like OpenAI’s DALL-E 2 or Google’s Imagen are able to generate artistic images from textual forms bridging intelligence across multiple domains.  Understanding the impact that transformers have had in the NLU and computer vision space, it's not difficult to imagine the influence they are likely to exert in areas like NFTs that rely on visual representations and textual interactions.  Self-supervised learning  Meta (Facebook) AI Research recently referred to self-supervised learning (SSL) as the “dark matter of AI” as an analogy about the foundational role that this new type of technique can have in the next generation of AI models. Conceptually, SSL tries to enable intelligent capabilities that resemble how babies learn by observation and interaction. SSL tries to overcome some of the limitations of traditional supervised learning methods that need to be trained with large volumes of labeled data. Models like Meta’s DINO are able to classify objects in images without previous training.  The applications of learning without massive amounts of labeled data seem perfect for crypto. Decentralized finance (DeFi) could be an immediate beneficiary of these methods.  Graph neural networks  Blockchain datasets represent the biggest source of data in crypto. From a structural standpoint, blockchain datasets are natively hierarchical as they model relationships between addresses, transactions or blocks. Graph neural networks (GNNs) is the AI-ML discipline that specializes in learning over hierarchical datasets. Companies like Google’s DeepMind are using GNNs to predict traffic in Google Maps or even understand the structure of glass.  GNNs seem like a perfect AI-ML technique for crypto assets. If blockchains are ever going to become intelligent, GNNs are likely to play a key role in developing knowledge from their native datasets.  Reinforcement learning  Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) became sort of pop culture after DeepMind’s AlphaGo defeated Go world champion Lee Sedol. AlphaGo mastered Go by playing an unfathomably large number of games against itself and correcting its own mistakes. This trial-error, learning by interaction form is the essence of DRL.  Since AlphaGo, DRL has been at the center of remarkable AI-ML achievements. DeepMind’s own AlphaFold shocked the scientific community by being able to predict the structure of proteins from a sequence of amino acids, a discovery that can unlock a new era in medicine. Another marquee DRL model from DeepMind is MuZero, which is able to master games, such as Go, chess or Atari games, without even knowing the rules.  The principles of DRL of learning by trial and error seem relevant to many areas of crypto, such as DeFi or NFTs, in which conditions change all the time. After all, most crypto protocols are based on strong game theoretic rules and DRL has excelled at games.  The path towards intelligence in crypto  Cyberpunk legend and science fiction writer William Gibson once said, “The future is already here – it's just not evenly distributed.” That quote could serve us as a philosophical guideline as we think about the path towards intelligent crypto assets. The creation of crypto coincided with the golden era of AI-ML research and technology developments. Today, AI-ML technologies are rapidly becoming mainstream and it’s a matter of time before they become a first-class citizen in the crypto space. The use cases seem to be everywhere. Let’s explore some of the most obvious.  Intelligent NFTs  There have been some applications of using AI-ML generative methods to create non-fungible tokens (NFTs). However, the influence of AI-ML should expand to all areas of the NFT space. Let’s imagine NFTs that incorporate language and speech capabilities to establish a dialog with users, answer questions about its meaning or interact with a specific environment. Just like you interact with your favorite digital assistant, imagine having a conversation with a visual NFT that can change its appearance based on the nature of the dialog. Similarly, think about using AI-ML transformer models that have been pretrained with millions of paintings to generate unique NFTs that capture unique aspects of the styles of the masters.  Intelligent DeFi protocols  Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are all about automation, but they are not exactly intelligent. Incorporating AI-ML capabilities into DeFi protocols seems inevitable. We can envision a new generation of automated market maker (AMM) protocols that can adjust the balances in pools using real-time predictive models based on existing market conditions. Similarly, we can think of lending protocols that adjust the size of loans based on an intelligent profile of the addresses requesting it.  Intelligent L1-L2 blockchains  AI-ML is influencing all aspects of software infrastructure, such as networking, compute and storage, and blockchains are unlikely to be an exception. It’s not far-fetched to think about intelligent consensus protocols that improve performance based on predictive models. Similarly, we can think of blockchains that develop intelligent economies to control the computation cost in the form of ""gas"" or other equivalents.  Intelligent crypto apps and dapps  User experience seems to be one of the most obvious areas to introduce AI-ML capabilities. It’s a matter of time before wallets or exchanges start incorporating native intelligence capabilities that help improve investment and trading decisions that today are fully reliant on human subjectivity.  Intelligent programmable stablecoins  The topic of programmable stablecoins seems very prominent these days after the Terra UST collapse. What if, instead of thinking about this form of stablecoin as programmable, we could think about forms that are not only programmable but also intelligent? Instead of programmable stablecoins that adjust the peg based on statically defined economic gymnastics, what if they could rely on AI-ML algorithms that organically learn from market conditions. A combination of AI-ML with human supervision seems to be an interesting approach to explore in this area.  AI-ML is influencing crypto, but crypto can also contribute to AI-ML  The relationship between crypto and AI-ML is more bidirectional than most people think. While the scenarios in which AI-ML can influence the next generation of crypto assets and infrastructure are fairly clear, there are some nonobvious areas in which crypto can influence AI-ML technologies.  Decentralized AI is an emerging technology movement that looks to leverage the decentralization compute as well as tokenization mechanisms to mitigate some of the increasing centralization challenges of AI-ML technologies. A subdomain of the general decentralized AI approach are mechanisms that leverage crypto assets to create economies in which companies and individuals are incentivized for sharing data and AI-ML models.  Data is the electricity of AI-ML, but it is highly controlled by a small number of incumbents, and there are virtually no incentives for companies to collaborate and share data to break that monopolistic cycle. Introducing clever tokenomics and incentive mechanisms could organically help to establish channels for companies to regularly cooperate in the creation and training of AI-ML models for specific tasks and share the benefits.  Bias and fairness is another hot topic in AI-ML these days that could be hugely influenced by the use of native crypto technologies. Datasets used in the training of AI-ML models are permeated with biases, discrimination and toxic data points that can influence the knowledge of AI models.  While there have been a lot of advancements in quantifying and monitoring the fairness of AI-ML models, there are no robust accountability and benchmarking mechanisms that are trusted across the entire industry. Imagine using a blockchain layer to keep track of the bias and fairness score of specific AI-ML models and compensate for models that are improving their fairness scores. This is a low-entry point scenario for the usage of blockchain technologies in AI-ML infrastructures.  Without a doubt, AI-ML should be a foundational element of the next generation of digital asset technologies, but there is also a lot of tangible value that crypto and blockchains can deliver in the world of AI-ML. Fundamentally, crypto could serve as an economic and accounting layer that helps build fairer and more democratic AI-ML solutions.  From digitization-automation to intelligence  AI-ML is influencing each and every area of the software world, and crypto is unlikely to be an exception. The core principles of digital asset technologies have been centered around democratizing financial services by using digitization and automation. Intelligence is one of the next frontiers for crypto, and we are likely to see the impact across the entire space. From intelligent NFTs to DeFi protocols to new forms of crypto assets, the incorporation of AI-ML is likely to unleash a new era of innovation in crypto. The technologies and use cases are already here. It’s time to start building.

While Bitcoin has fallen below the $29K range, Ether has lost its hold on the $1800 handle and is approaching the $1700 support level. In addition, ETH&apos;s price behavior indicates a significant chance of adverse repercussions that might push the cryptocurrency&apos;s value below $1700. If investors are unable to defend the crucial support at $1,700, ETH is more likely to drop to the next major level at $1,450, which is also its January 2018 all-time high.

42421564,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXocph,1654440600,"Bitcoin Might, in Fact, Be the Great ‘Equalizer’","A few months back, some of my work proximity associates thought it would be interesting to run a wide-reaching, sweeping Bitcoin survey to learn more about the demographics, user behaviors and general perceptions of this hotly debated digital thingamabob. Of course, we had other things to do, and so it got away from us.  Like all good ideas, we weren’t the only ones who had it. Over Memorial Day weekend Block (SQ) – the parent company of two prominent Bitcoin businesses, Cash App and Spiral – published a report titled “Bitcoin: Knowledge and Perceptions” with Wakefield Research. The report surveyed 9,500 people in 14 countries.  As a bitcoiner, I already had some of the findings anecdotally established in my head, but now I have pertinent survey data to back up my idealistic thoughts about how “Bitcoin’s going to fix the world” or whatever.  In all, the report is worth diving into, so let’s do that.  – George Kaloudis  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I recognize the cheapness in co-opting 12 pages of content produced by a ⅛-hippie-bitcoiner-led, publicly traded company whose entire strategic direction depends on the success of Bitcoin for this newsletter.  Whatever.  The report is worth paying attention to for two main reasons.  It’s a quality piece of professional content to back up some of the anecdotal “good stuff” so that we can stop waving our hands while evangelizing Bitcoin.  It made Bitcoin look pretty good.  The three key findings outlined in the report are:  Bitcoin provides promise for a more equitable economy.  Bitcoin education is key for its adoption.  Bitcoin is far better known than other cryptocurrencies.  Keep in mind we don’t have access to the survey itself, and so there might be implicit bias in the framing of the survey questions. That would explain the third-party market research consultancy that was attached to the report. While that doesn’t absolve Block from potential bias, it makes me less skeptical. (Yes, I am hedging, and no, I don’t feel bad about it.)  Bitcoin for a more equitable world  There are three main focuses related to Bitcoin and equity mentioned in the report: 1) income, 2) geography and 3) gender.  The findings related to income levels, while interesting, aren’t as pronounced as the other two. What’s more, the geography bit is tied to the income/wealth bit. In short, the report suggests higher-income people buy for investment reasons (make money, diversify, etc.), and lower-income people buy bitcoin for utility reasons (easy way to send money, to purchase goods).  The geography bit that’s tied to the income/wealth bit manifests itself when you consider the percentage of respondents who would buy bitcoin to buy things plotted against the per-capita gross domestic product of the country they live in. There is a clear (visual) relationship of “down and to the right,” suggesting that individuals from poorer countries see more value in bitcoin as a means for transacting.  Bitcoin as “digital cash” is the original use case, but as discussed in previous newsletters, that’s just narrative. In fact, the survey shows there is also a logarithmic-looking relationship between the percentage of respondents who would use bitcoin to protect against inflation versus the rate of inflation in their country.  Small note here: A willingness to use bitcoin to protect against inflation doesn’t guarantee it will.  Moving past the money part of Bitcoin, findings on perceived exclusivity is presented as one of the negative results of the survey. The report presents a map that shows the percentage of respondents who agreed with the notion that the Bitcoin community is not inclusive of people like them. A lot of countries are split. South Africans poll very pro-Bitcoin, but Indians feel quite the opposite.  There are two possibilities here. 1) India’s historically tough stance on crypto has soured sentiment on Bitcoin, or 2) the Bitcoin community’s toxic maximalism culture that shows itself on social media platforms has soured Indian sentiment on Bitcoin. A single bad experience on social media is all it takes.  Lastly in this section, the report makes an interesting claim:  The gender divide in bitcoin ownership and self-described knowledge is more pronounced in the Americas but less male-dominated when looking at the rest of the world.  That quote’s accompanying graphic can be overwhelming, but the main takeaway is this: Women in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and APAC (Asia-Pacific) claim expert knowledge at higher rates than men. Sure, this is great, but I would like to see more on this topic before using the phrase “there is no gender divide” as stated in the report (Block’s quote was: “There is no gender divide between people who both own bitcoin and see themselves as experts.”).  Knowledge feeds optimism  In this section, Block put it best: “Education is key.” When it comes to growing Bitcoin’s network effect by getting more people to buy and use bitcoin, the more respondents knew about Bitcoin, the more likely they were to purchase bitcoin in the next year.  Anecdotally, a lack of education on the topic is what most developers point to when I ask them about the biggest blockers for adoption.  Bitcoin is No. 1  On the last page of the report, Block made an innocuous claim: Bitcoin is the best-known cryptocurrency. We know that. But the gap between bitcoin and second-place ether (ETH) was much larger than I would have thought. While 88% of respondents had heard of bitcoin, only 43% had heard of ether.  My gut tells me Block included this to make investors feel that the company was right to focus only on Bitcoin. But I feel it is also included to highlight that longevity has perks. One of the reasons Bitcoin is better known is because it has succeeded for a longer period of time.  In all, the report is high level and should be shared widely. It provides a great overview of the pertinent social questions being asked about Bitcoin, while giving some concrete figures in response to those questions.  But we need to go deeper. I look forward to reading (and maybe writing) some of the surveys and reports this one inspires.",POSITIVE,ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | RESEARCH,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/05/bitcoin-might-in-fact-be-the-great-equalizer,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/753cc422a6fad1d5a086bd4d52e4720091db7a94-5184x3348.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
