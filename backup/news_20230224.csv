In a blog post, Oasis, which develops multi-signature wallet software into which the hacker deposited funds, said whitehats recently notified it of “a previously unknown vulnerability in the design of the admin multisig access.” Following a Feb. 21 order from the High Court of England and Wales, it exploited that vulnerability to take back the funds.  “We stress that this access was there with the sole intention to protect user assets in the event of any potential attack, and would have allowed us to move quickly to patch any vulnerability disclosed to us,” Oasis said.  It said it returned the funds to an “authorized third party.” A Blockworks article that preceded Oasis’ blog post identified Jump Crypto – developer of Wormhole – as the owner of the wallets that received the seized funds.

42414354,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB4TEq,1677279634,Crypto Investors' $28M ‘Black Thursday’ Lawsuit Against DeFi Giant Maker Dismissed by US Judge,"A federal judge dismissed a class-action lawsuit that alleged investors on Maker, one of the largest decentralized finance protocols, suffered some $8 million in losses because the platform misrepresented risks, according to a court document filed on Wednesday.  The “Black Thursday” lawsuit filed in April 2020 claimed that Maker-related entities including Maker Ecosystem Growth Foundation misrepresented collateralized debt positions on the platform as more secure investments than other assets because they required over-collateralization, CoinDesk reported at the time.  The Maker Ecosystem Growth Foundation was dissolved as part of a strategy helmed by founder Rune Christensen to decentralize the protocol, handing operations over to a decentralized autonomous organization called MakerDAO.  Read more: MakerDAO Foundation Plots Its Own Demise  Judge Maxine M. Chesney of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed the complaint, saying that “Maker Growth [Foundation] is not a proper defendant because it has been dissolved, and therefore lacks capacity to be sued,” and that the “plaintiff has failed to allege facts sufficient to support each of his claims for relief.”  This was the second amended version of the complaint.  Maker is a lending protocol, where users can withdraw loans in the platform’s native stablecoin dai (DAI) by pledging assets such as ether (ETH) as collateral. Borrowers must maintain a certain collateral level to avoid liquidation. To counter volatile crypto prices, Maker requires loans to be over-collateralized, meaning borrowers have to lock up a higher value of assets than their debt.  But Peter Johnson, the lead plaintiff, claimed that Maker advertised the over-collateralization policy as a safeguard that caps losses at 13% and that the collateral would return to users. When ETH’s price sharply dropped in March 2020 during a market-wide crash, his position and that of many others on the platform were liquidated, Johnson alleged.

Plaintiffs may amend the complaint and file a third version until March 17, “as there is no showing the deficiencies noted above cannot be cured,” the judge said.",NEGATIVE,ETH | DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MKR | DAI,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/24/crypto-investors-28m-black-thursday-lawsuit-against-defi-giant-maker-dismissed-by-us-judge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e794c3571a2bcd5381d345837041d1263b23a3a7-6048x4024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393854,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brQyD5,1677277205,"Crypto Markets Analysis: Bitcoin Falls for the Week Amid Inflation, Rate Hike Fears","Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) have lost their momentum over the past seven days, with each posting 6% declines as investors worried about inflation and continued monetary hawkishness.  On Friday the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization plunged after the U.S. Commerce Department reported that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index climbed by an unexpectedly robust 5.4% in January, offering the latest evidence that inflation remained problematic. The PCE price index is the U.S. Federal Reserve’s favored inflation gauge.  BTC dipped near $23,000 at one point Friday, its lowest level in nine days. ETH was recently off about 2.5% over the past 24 hours.  Weekly rankings  On a relative basis, BTC’s seven-day performance was 22nd among crypto assets with a greater than $1 billion market capitalization. Ether finished 23rd among the group. Still, the two assets remain up 39% and 32% year to date amid a moderately, more upbeat economic environment than in 2022.  Topping the list was tezos (XTZ), the token of the self-amending protocol that facilitates the creation of smart contracts. Tezos posted an 8% gain over the most recent seven days, and is up 74% year to date.  At the bottom was fantom (FTM), the token of the Fantom smart contract platform, that posted a 17% loss.  While falling below the $1 billion market cap threshold, the token (OP) of the Optimism network rose approximately 20% this week, following Coinbase Global’s (COIN) announcement of its new layer 2 network launch. The network will be built using Optimism, which will also serve as a core platform developer.  Technically, momentum for both BTC and ETH declined this week because their Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings fell near the neutral level of 50. Bitcoin’s price has declined for four consecutive days on above-average volume. ETH’s price has fallen in five of the most recent seven days.  BTC’s 50-day moving average remains above its 200-day moving average, a so-called golden cross that usually yields positive results but has yet to do so in this most recent instance. BTC’s price is down 6% since its occurrence on Feb. 18.  The pricing relationship between BTC and ETH remains tight, as their correlation coefficient sits at 0.94.  Bitcoin’s prior inverse correlation with the dollar index (DXY) has shifted this week to positive, with a correlation coefficient of 0.50.  On a macroeconomic basis, little occurred this week to shake the probabilities of continued interest rate hikes by the U.S. central bank's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). While inflation has moderated, the persistently tight labor market remains concerning for Federal Reserve governors.  Week-to-date performance among the CoinDesk CMI sectors shows the Digitization sector up slightly to lead the rankings, with all other CMI sectors trading negatively. Members of the CoinDesk Digitization index include Braintrust (BTRST), Civic (CVC), Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and Galxe (GAL).",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH | ENS,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | ENS,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/24/crypto-markets-analysis-bitcoin-falls-for-the-week-amid-inflation-rate-hike-fears,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/04f70d4c76b76b55e6202d8c9f449637a9048a04-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Now that the public sale has ended, users will be able to claim their purchased FCTR tokens Saturday, Feb. 25, at 18:00 UTC, which is the same time the token starts trading on decentralized exchange Camelot.  Factor, which doesn’t require users to learn coding to create customized strategies for asset management, aims to provide middleware infrastructure for the decentralized finance (DeFi) space by aggregating various markets on its platform.  Several hours before the four-day public sale finished, FactorDAO announced on Twitter several changes designed to decrease the initial circulating supply to 18 million tokens, or 18% of the total supply, down from 32.5 million tokens originally.  First among these changes was increasing the liquidity owned by the protocol for the USDC/FCTR pair on Camelot. When participating in the token generation event, users would deposit stablecoin USDC into the protocol in exchange for FCTR. Half of the USDC funds raised from the public sale will now be deployed into a liquidity pool that is owned by the protocol. Initially, only 40% was to be used for protocol owned liquidity.  Second, ecosystem incentives, such as emissions from staking, are now vested for 12 months and not made available immediately.  By Saturday, holders of FCTR will be able to trade or stake their tokens. If users decide to stake their token as liquidity, they’ll receive veFCTR, which allows them to participate in Factor’s governance process as well as earn 50% of the fees from the revenue generated from the protocol, according to Factor’s documents.  Factor’s token FCTR has a circulating market capitalization of $13.6 million at time of press, according Factor’s launchpad page on Camelot.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Sage D.

42410830,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggrtoK,1677272063,"‘Italian FTX’ Leaves Users in Limbo, Citing ‘Difficulties in Liquidity Management’","On Feb. 17, users of a small but well-known Italian crypto exchange received emails saying The Rock Trading (TRT) was having liquidity issues and is ""interrupting"" its work.  “The company is conducting internal audits to identify the causes of the problem and evaluating the adoption of all appropriate or necessary initiatives to protect customers and other stakeholders,” said the email, reviewed by CoinDesk. The website became a single page showing the same message.  By Tuesday, Feb. 21, the exchange said it was pausing its operations.  TRT's problems are yet another chapter in the history of the past year's crashes, shutdowns and bankruptcies in crypto. The list includes the collapse of Terraform Labs, the bankruptcy of the Three Arrows Capital hedge fund, crypto lenders Celsius Network, BlockFi and Voyager Digital, miners Core Scientific and Compute North and the spectacular downfall of U.S. crypto exchange FTX.  Read also: CoinDesk Wins a Polk Award, One of Journalism's Top Prizes, for Explosive FTX Coverage  'I owe you an apology'  On Tuesday, TRT had a new announcement: Users could access their accounts but in read-only mode, meaning they could view their balances and trending history and generate reports, but could not trade or withdraw money from the exchange.  The same day, TRT Chief Financial Officer Andrea Medri told about 2,370 people in the TRT Telegram group that “the TRT team has been working cohesively and non-stop since last Friday to manage the crisis,” and promised more information.  “Do I owe you an apology? Yes, of course. I understand the fears and discomforts many of you have and all of my work is to find solutions that get us out of this storm. Unfortunately, I will not be able to answer the many questions that will follow, but I guarantee you that I will not spare myself in the work in progress,” Medri said.  On Thursday, journalists at RAI, the national public broadcasting company of Italy, reported they could not find the exchange team at the official company address.  Some users called for joint legal action against TRT, but so far there is hope the exchange will find a way out of the crisis. TRT has been trusted by Italian traders for more than a decade. “The Rock is a small exchange, but here in Italy it was considered one of the most trustworthy,” a user named Carlo told CoinDesk.  “I have been very happy with TRT for over 6 years, and I am sure and hope that they will resolve this situation to restart even stronger and with a storm overcome as in the times of the crisis [at] Mt. Gox,” one of the users posted in the group chat.  Mt. Gox, which operated out of Japan between 2010 and 2014 and once transacting 70% of all bitcoin, collapsed spectacularly, leading to years of user lawsuits to retrieve funds held by the exchange.  Read also: Mt. Gox’s 2 Largest Creditors Pick Payout Option That Won’t Force Bitcoin Sell-Off: Sources  Old as Mt. Gox  TRT was founded in 2011, proudly calling itself “The First European Exchange” – TRT was indeed among the first crypto exchanges ever. It was founded the same year as another early European exchange, Bitstamp, and one year earlier than LocalBitcoins (which recently closed). The founders, Andrea Medri and Davide Barbieri, started their first joint enterprise, an insurance company in the virtual reality space called “Second Life,” in 2007.  In 2010, the two repurposed the company for trading currencies and stocks; the following year they launched a bitcoin exchange. Since 2013 the company has been registered in Malta. In September 2020, TRT raised 1.5 million euros in funding.  According to Italian media, which often calls TRT the ""Italian FTX,"" the platform had about 34,000 registered users, although members of the Telegram group chat believe that active users did not exceed 5,000.  According to CoinGecko, TRT trading volumes have been pretty modest through 2022, barely reaching even $1 million daily. However, in March there was a sudden surge in activity when the daily volume exceeded $72 million for just one day. According to one of the users, back then founder Andrea Medri told a closed group of investors that the abnormality was created by a single trading bot that ran berserk.  According to Il Fatto Quotidiano, TRT has had financial difficulties since 2021, when its IT provider was compromised and 311 ether (ETH), worth about 900,000 euros, was stolen from the exchange. The company filled the hole in its coffers with its own reserves, the publication wrote. In January 2023, the Italian bank Banca Sella closed TRT’s account; on Feb. 8, TRT announced the company had switched to the Irish bank Modulr, Corriere della Sera wrote.  It’s hard to tell how much customer money was stuck in TRT’s crypto wallets on Feb. 17 when the company revealed its liquidity issues.  TRT users had been complaining about long withdrawal times for months before the shutdown, according to Corriere della Sera. Now, over a thousand users are discussing potential legal steps to get their money back in a separate Telegram group, and some said they have already complained to Italy’s register of financial agents, the OAM.  Andrea Medri and Davide Barbieri (who is the chief tech officer of TRT) did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment in Telegram and LinkedIn by press time.

42393921,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brc4Zl,1677271634,Inside the mtnDAO: Solana Devs Gather for a Month-Long Utah Retreat,"Across from a seedy 7-Eleven and around the corner from a Victorian-style municipal hall in central Salt Lake City, Utah, Solana developers flock for a month-long coding retreat: mtnDAO.  “GM,” the builders crowed to each tired face that shuffled into The Shop – this hacker house’s upscale coworking space – on a recent Monday morning. “Are you skiing later today?” one arrival asked Barrett, the ringleader who rips Snowbird ski resort when he’s not building software to trade tokens that centralized exchanges don’t touch.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s “BUIDL Week.""  “Nah,” Barrett replied. His team at Cypher had just launched version three of its on-chain trading software and the behind-the-scenes needed a little risk tuning. “We’ve got some degenerates on the platform already,” he said a little later to a passerby.  Besides, he said, the midweek snow forecast for Little Cottonwood Canyon looked absolutely delectable: 60 inches! Better to frontload the backend work to make room for powder heaven. “I have been known to get up there and get inverted from time to time,” he explained.  Getting inverted is what it’s all about at this code-hard-shred-harder crypto club. A record 250 people applied to attend this February’s self-proclaimed “notorious action-packed hacker house,” now in its third iteration. For some Solana devs, the community-run mtnDAO has become a seasonal tradition that began during the chain’s heady bull run. It continues today through the depths of the bear.  Read more: Dan Kuhn - It's Time to BUIDL Week  MtnDAO version 3 (v3) is putting to the test whether Solana’s developer ecosystem can recapture its momentum after a dreadful 2022 bookended by chain halts and the collapse of FTX. Cracks are showing: MtnDAO, once a purely Solana event, is now co-sponsored by rival platform Aptos.  But mtnDAO founders Barrett and Edgar Pavlovsky, from another decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol called MarginFi, are just as committed to Solana as ever. They’ve turned a sponsor-backed budget near $100,000 into a one-month coworking bonanza where code regularly ships.  The Shop  Barrett’s army of 24 computer monitors command the entire second floor of The Shop and on any given day most of his rented seats are filled. These hoodie-wearing twenty-somethings hail from as far away as South Korea and as close as down the street. They slam energy drinks well past last call, breaking only for lunch and also late night poker games. Many rip cigarettes, gnash nicotine gum, smash vapes.  Clickety-clack went their keyboards at 11:59 a.m. on this Monday as big-haired Barrett, dual-wielding Red Bulls, strode past three rows of hungry devs. Ambient alt-rock wafted down from The Shop’s third floor, where this coworking space’s non-crypto clientele mostly roamed, drawing out pre-lunch jitters. But after noon-time food delivery – today’s menu: chicken katsu and rice – the hacker house horde had started to rally and break into conversation.  Read more: Bitcoin’s Future Hinges on Donations, and That’s Got People Worried  Calling mtnDAO a “hacker house” is a bit of a misnomer. Sure, some of the attendees are hackers (though most are indeed coders and some such) but Edgar and Barrett haven’t hosted them in a house since the event’s precursor in 2021. That was when the former college roommates stuffed 25 “kids” into a six-bedroom house owned by a producer of the high-octane dirt bike TV show ""Nitro Circus."" It was called mtnCompound, and it was a lot.  One year later, Barrett wanted to throw his concept into “turbo mode” with paying sponsors who might thumb their noses at, say, the mansion of a guy best known for collaborating with Johnny Knoxville of ""Jackass."" So he asked The Shop, a boutique coworking space in central Salt Lake City where some 200 members pay for clean desks, natural lighting, speedy internet and subtle Union Pacific railroad motifs, if it would host his band of digital nomads for a month.  Anne Olsen, community manager at The Shop and member of mtnDAO’s Telegram group, said the company had never before worked with a month-long coworking event, but it jumped at the opportunity to bring people together.  “It’s one of the first times that a hacker house was brought to a place designed for productivity,” Olsen said.  The ambiance of mtnDAO is different from Solana’s roving armada of official hacker houses. Seemingly every month Solana Labs and market-making giant Jump Capital stage week-long coding extravaganzas in a different global city. Their guerrilla marketing campaign attempts to spread the gospel of Solana’s super-fast blockchain by appealing directly to its would-be converts.  Read more: Casey Rodarmor: The Quest to Make Bitcoin Fun Again  But these collaborative ordeals trend more clubby than coworker, according to the partisans of mtnDAO. They’re not fans of the Solana hacker house’s blasting techno, or its seeming insistence on drenching desks in enough purple lights to turn Barney the Dinosaur colorblind. If you can hear your desk-mate amid the din, it must only be because the organizers are between panels.  “Here I feel people are not pressured to sit and listen to lectures. They can work on their stuff,” said Angelo Boskovic, head of business development for token management startup Streamflow. He’d flown from Belgrade for two weeks of mtnDAO.  Work-from-office  Even as some tech companies slowly reel their workforces back for part-time in-person workweeks, in crypto – especially DeFi, with its emphasis on decentralization – brick and mortar simply doesn’t exist. Many of the teams at mtnDAO scatter across time zones and Telegram chats, some employees have never before met their own coworkers in person. Work in an office? Monday through Friday? Fuggetaboutit.  At mtnDAO, they work on Saturday and Sunday, too.  “Every night I’ve been here late,” said Lee Tirrell, a full-time data scientist who flew in from Oregon to work on his crypto side hustle, a Solana-based analytics product called Spire. Never before a crypto conference attendee, he recognizes fellow developers by their “monkey JPEGs on the internet,” not their faces. He decided to come after hearing about mtnDAO on Twitter.  Most everyone at this winter’s mtnDAO heard about it on Twitter or through word of mouth. Barrett and Edgar spend nothing on marketing (beyond paying a trio of interns to organize events, take photos and push out promotional tweets).  “My strategy here is memes and s**tposts,” said Harry Swales, mtnDAO’s tweeter-in-chief, who said his job is “to get people to show up and engage and build.” It's not a hard sell for the hired marketing gun: “I’m selling the experience, but the experience is free.”  There’s no cost to attend mtnDAO. It's one month of unlimited free coffee, ski lift tickets, tables at clubs, mountains of swag and enough Red Bull to kill Cocaine Bear. There are several sponsors, including Solana.  Community conversations  It’s the kind of place where dinner conversations spiral between the quixotic futility of crypto idealism and breathless speculation of when the next bull run will hit.  “Everyone is trying to do democracy through DAOs and democracy is [damned] retarded – you need to have a chain of command,” said one mtnDAO developer at a recent taco Thursday, referring to decentralized autonomous organizations. He later described his project’s slightly questionable tokenomics: It grew in value by accruing value generated by newcomers for the benefit of the first-in token-holders.  Over meals and between meetings, builders shared their life-hacks for getting work done faster. A common refrain was the limitless potential of ChatGPT, the generative artificial intelligence (AI) program that can be prompted to produce tailored poetry, essays, film treatments, restaurant reviews – and also much of the front-end code for one’s Web app.  Read more: Jeff Wilser – A Day in the Life of a Dev: Ethereum’s Justin Florentine  The meme-laden internet-speak these builders tout online leaked into their time IRL. For example, if something goes awry, “you got rugged.” It was as if their text-based conversations had never stopped.  Not all attendees were taken by the energy of mtnDAO, however. One visitor told CoinDesk the entire affair felt rather muted, a feeling they chalked up to the slightly depressed state of Solana overall.  The current crypto bear market hit the chain harder than most others, manifesting in falling network usage statistics and the battered price of SOL, one of the worst major token performers of 2022 (the asset is down roughly 38% since the FTX crypto exchange’s collapse in November). Still, Solana’s developer scene remains the largest and most vibrant of any outside the Ethereum community.  MtnDAO began as a Solana-only event and the vast majority of this rendition’s members were building in Rust, the chain’s base coding language. But a handful are focused on Aptos. The up-and-coming network notably co-sponsored mtnDAO v3; it sent representatives to run workshops with attendees and swag for them to rep during “Aptos week,” which included a free trip to Snowbird.  “The only thing we changed is we opened up to it being multichain,” Barrett said.  The success has emboldened Barrett and co-founder Edgar to take mtnDAO corporate – literally. On Feb. 6, mtnDAO LLC was registered in Delaware, state records show. Barrett hinted mtnDAO “may go multi-location” in future iterations, and v3 will certainly not be the last. He’s not stopping at The Shop.  But The Shop is as eager as ever to host his strange and scrambled band of globetrotting hackers, Anne Olsen, the community manager, said. She presumes mtnDAO will keep happening with the changing of the seasons – winter, summer and winter again. It’s not like she or the Shop gets early warning of the coming swarm.  She found out v3 was happening via Twitter.  Barrett says he remains committed to building Cypher on Solana, even if his event money comes from a chain some see as its rival. He framed the decision as one that makes mtnDAO more inclusive of crypto builders; after all, some Solana builders have left for Aptos in recent months.  MtnDAO’s model has spilled out to the wider Solana ecosystem. In Greece, Solana developer Dean Pappas is organizing his second annual “AthensDAO” hacker house inspired by mtnDAO. Pappas said AthensDAO adheres to a set of “environment” guidelines from the Solana Foundation – “being open, lighting, seating and desks” – in exchange for funding, merchandise and the Foundation’s stamp of approval.  When asked if mtnDAO was interested in seeking Solana leadership’s “hacker house X” designation, Barrett scoffed. The brand is too “valuable,” he said, clearly proud of mtnDAO’s independence.  A handful of teams who formed here or built here have gone on to win hackathon prizes, or get funding from venture firms.  “It’s cool to see what we’ve done inspire other people to take the initiative and not wait for Solana to host a hacker house in their city, and just do it themselves,” Barrett said.",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | SOL | TRADING | APT,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/02/24/solana-devs-gather-for-a-month-long-utah-retreat-coindesk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/82bff93fa2f92ecae65f01aaef1f2558dd139dab-1800x1200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414345,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB4Sdh,1677271175,"For Solana Users, 'Priority Fees' Mean Paying Up to Skip the Line","Doing business on the Solana blockchain is more expensive than ever. For the network and its users, that might be a good thing.  Priority fees, a key feature among major tech upgrades Solana developers pushed last year to fight crippling congestion issues, are going mainstream among the ecosystem’s wallets and trading protocols, with heavyweights including exchange aggregator Jupiter and trading pool operator Orca joining in.  Users can pay the additional fees to validators on the Solana network to have their transactions prioritized – so they go through faster. The extra boost can make all the difference in high-traffic situations, like a fleeting crypto-trading arbitrage opportunity or in the scramble for a hot non-fungible token (NFT) mint.  In one recent epoch (the blockchain’s time period for validators) nearly three-quarters of all nonvote transactions had priority fees attached, per data from validator statistics service Solana Compass. That rate set a new high water mark for priority fee adoption, which has been growing all year.  The average transaction fee Solana users paid in that epoch (epoch 402) was 0.000014641 SOL, a 67% increase over rates in early July but still only fractions of a penny based on the current market price. That added up to 963 SOL spent on priority fees last epoch, or nearly $24,000 – a rounding error based on the overall value moving across the network.  “Most users can pay 100x current costs and not care since it's still sub-cent,” the pseudonymous 7Layer, who runs Overclock validator service, said in a Twitter DM.  The priority fees are helping bring order to a network that’s had its share of chaos, most memorably and infamously at the hands of trading bots who in 2021 spammed the network into oblivion. Developers say such things shouldn’t happen under the new tech regime.  Trade-Offs  Solana’s trade-off between price and speed isn’t nearly as poignant as on Ethereum, where congestion in one corner of the network makes doing business expensive for everyone. That’s because Solana’s architecture is built to handle many transactions at once, said Austin Federa, head of strategy for the Solana Foundation.  For example: If lots of traders are trying to swap BONK tokens for the stablecoin USDC on the same exchange at once, they might start paying priority fees to ensure their trades go through at the prices they want. But even during that high traffic time, the local fee market for minting an NFT elsewhere on Solana won’t get more expensive. On Ethereum it would.  Jonny Platt, CEO of Solana Compass, told CoinDesk priority fees are changing the economics of running his validators on Solana. He said average block rewards are 20% higher year over year.  Half of the value of priority fees go to validators such as Platt as reward for lending their compute power to the network; the other half of the priority fee gets burned. Platt said this burn mechanism should drive more value into SOL tokens over time by making the tokens more scarce.  “So many normal everyday users of Solana are excited to see this because there’s recognition that we’ve improved over last year,” Platt said of priority fees.  Outrageous outages  Solana suffered multiple well-documented (and excoriated) network outages in 2022 and 2021, some of which were driven by bots pummeling one corner of the blockchain simultaneously. In one such outage, in September 2021, bots crowded a token sale on exchange Raydium with more transactions than Solana could handle. Solana basically broke, going offline for 17 hours – an eon in 24/7 cryptocurrency markets.  To address the spam issue, core developers began a year-long effort to change how Solana handles transactions. It would ditch the “first-come-first-served” transaction execution model for “fee markets” that gave favor to those who paid for priority.  Solana transaction fees are the sum of a static base fee plus a dynamic computational fee. With priority fees, users who want faster execution can opt to pay some extra SOL. Bots who previously spammed the network for dominance won’t win on transaction volume alone, validators said.  “It reduces the incentive because priority based on fee matters more instead of just spamming hard to get in front of the queue,” 7Layer said. “There haven't been any spam issues close to what they used to be.”  Priority fees haven’t completely solved Solana’s spam issue, said St. Gnu, another pseudonymous validator. The network is extremely cheap to do business on, extra fees or not. He said Solana’s core developers will need to build out more fee features that make spamming less economical.  “The issue is that if you want to just ‘spray and pray’ a bunch of transactions there's not really a big cost to do that,” he said in a Telegram message.",POSITIVE,SOL | BONK,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | BONK,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/24/for-solana-users-priority-fees-mean-paying-up-to-skip-the-line,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a50863c306a2ebd727bbd954238ca7b8086a27f5-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414344,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB4Sj0,1677269370,"SEC’s Coinbase Insider Trading Case Is ‘Backdoor Rulemaking,’ Trade Association’s CEO Says","The Chamber of Digital Commerce is trying to stop a case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against a former Coinbase (COIN) employee accused of insider trading. The organization’s founder, Perianne Boring, said if the SEC succeeds, many digital assets could be defined as securities.  “We see this action as seriously concerning and would have significant ramifications for the entire digital asset industry,” Boring said Friday on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” about the group's “friend of the court” (amicus) brief in the SEC action before the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.  Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) charged former Coinbase manager Ishan Wahi with wire fraud for sharing information with his brother, Nikhil Wahi, and friend Sameer Ramani regarding which tokens would be listed on the crypto exchange’s platform before they went live.  The SEC swiftly followed suit, charging the trio with the same insider trading allegations. According to Boring, the SEC “piggybacked” on the DOJ case, essentially “latching onto a third party who had nothing to do with the issuance of these tokens.”  At a time when crypto companies find themselves in a tussle with regulators, Boring said what the SEC is doing is another example of regulating by enforcement and does nothing to define “what sort of digital asset transactions it considers to be securities transactions.”  If the court rules in favor of the SEC, nine of the supposed 25 crypto assets the trio purchased and sold could be defined as securities. This could lead to further legal battles for other crypto companies that list the tokens, she said.  That's why her group filed the amicus brief, arguing that the SEC’s crackdown is a form of “backdoor rulemaking.”  Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world and itself in the crosshairs of U.S. regulators, is among one of the contributors to the association’s legal filing.  Attempts to dismiss SEC case  Earlier this month, Wahi pleaded guilty to insider trading charges, while his brother Nikhil pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy charges. Wahi’s lawyers, however, have since filed a motion to dismiss the SEC’s securities fraud charges, claiming the tokens listed were utility-based and not investment contracts.  The SEC’s Wahi case could be redundant, in part because “they’ve already been indicted by the DOJ,” Boring said. Still, in “no way, shape or form,” is the trade association “trying to downplay the seriousness of insider trading” she said.  “I want to be super-clear that anyone who breaks the laws, breaks just basic code of ethics, we should absolutely enforce against those individuals,” Boring said, adding that the DOJ’s case would have “absolutely nothing to do with the punishments” Wahi and his counterparts face.  Nonetheless, “a ruling that embraces the SEC’s position and endorses its tactics could have negative implications for the digital asset ecosystem,” Boring said.  She added the only regulatory guidance provided by the SEC has been in “the form of nonbinding speeches and statements that have been conflicting from administration to administration.”  CoinDesk reached out for comment from the SEC but did not hear back by the time of publication.

42421074,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXWRbh,1677268402,Peloton’s Robin Arzón Is Building a Web3 Community Around Working Out,"The fitness industry has long used gamification methods to motivate health and wellness. From FitBits to workout-tracking apps, data gamification has given fitness brands new insights into customer behavior while motivating gym goers to stay on target with their goals.  “Anything that gets people moving is a good thing,” says Robin Arzón, vice president of fitness programming and head instructor at Peloton. “I've gone through seasons of gamification in my life, even though I certainly wouldn't call myself a gamer.”  Arzón has been exploring how Web3 can embolden fitness communities more effectively than centralized membership platforms. She recently founded Swagger Society, a Web3 lifestyle membership club that is expected to be launch in the coming months. Though she says she prefers “throwing barbells” over her head and running sprints more than working out through augmented reality (AR) games and virtual reality (VR) headsets, she’s open to the ways that Web3 technology might improve our overall health.  “Who knows what the future holds?” says Arzón. “I'm not going to knock somebody's path to wellness. If [games] work for them, and they're able to do it consistently — go for it.”  The move-to-earn economy  Behavior change is a major component in most fitness clubs today. Gym memberships often come with proprietary data-tracking apps that sync with members’ devices and document progress over time. In some ways, the fitness industry’s culture is similar to that of Web3, which places a major focus on incentivizing participation. Many decentralized protocols (DeFi) protocols and Web3 communities function smoothly due to a shared allegiance to economic incentives. Examples include non-fungible token (NFT) airdrops for loyal fans, crypto rewards for staking a particular coin or distributing proof-of-attendance protocols (POAP) for showing up to an event. Even the existence of crypto is made possible through mining rewards, which pay miners for using their computer power to verify transactions.  Interesting possibilities emerge when we combine the economic approach of Web3 with the fitness industry. Last year, a new fitness-oriented category of blockchain gaming called move-to-earn (M2E) games tested the theory that rewarding consumers with crypto tokens would motivate them to exercise. The popular Solana-based M2E game StepN reported $122.5 million in profits in the second quarter of 2022, and its ecosystem token GMT has a total market cap of ​​over $231 million. Moreover, StepN says its users ran more than 104 billion miles in the process of earning their crypto last year, a nod to the potential efficacy of M2E gaming. But is such progress sustainable?  Arzón believes that gamification can certainly motivate behavior, but beyond any new gimmicks and gadgets, it’s good old-fashioned consistency that unlocks the true benefits of fitness as a lifestyle. For this level of transformation, a person needs more than a game or a token, they need an accountability partner, says Arzón.  “Finding like-minded, values-driven folks who are willing to put those values into action is what gives [a new behavior] ‘stickiness,’” said Arzón. “That's certainly what Swagger Society will be based on, community as the linchpin of everything that we do.”  She believes that, beyond the short-term incentivization of M2E gaming, NFT membership models may provide the perfect level of “stickiness” because members become more than simply monthly subscribers. Purchasing an NFT acts as a lifetime, all-access pass, granting holders entry to a community led by their favorite instructors without third-party intermediaries and centralized platforms.  “It's exciting for me to be able to reward my day-one followers and my new followers in unprecedented ways, as well as have them invest in this new creative economy in a way that's never been possible before,” said Arzón.  She hopes Swagger Society will give her more direct communication with her followers and create a “feedback loop” allowing her to go deeper with members’ needs.  “I want to engage in a way that I've never been able to do before this technology,” she said. “I’m interested in being a fire starter in people's lives through the mechanisms with which I can do that the most dynamically, robustly and directly.”  Listen: Silencing Your Inner Critic: Peloton’s Robin Arzón Introduces ‘Swagger Society’",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | AR,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/02/24/pelotons-robin-arzon-is-building-a-web3-community-around-working-out,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/975be8e31fd417843d7b15679abaf2281a5b9012-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421355,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnshJ,1677268069,"Crypto Industry Needs More FTC, Less SEC","Is there a method to the SEC’s madness?  Of all the Securities and Exchange Commission’s actions against crypto entities that have stirred the industry’s ire, the agency’s recent move forcing New York-based Paxos to cease issuing its partner Binance’s BUSD stablecoin is the most deserving of an outcry. How, critics rightfully asked, can a token that’s explicitly designed not to fluctuate in price be considered a security?  But a recent account in Fortune suggests the SEC may not have been thinking of securities law at all in that action. Binance was automatically converting competitor-issued stablecoins held by its exchange’s customers’ into BUSD. To me, that looks like an antitrust concern, not one of BUSD being a security.  Now, if there’s one area of enforcement where the crypto community, with its anti-middleman ethos of decentralization, should get behind, it’s prosecution of monopolistic behavior. But that leaves us with the question of why is the SEC getting involved here and not the nation’s trustbuster, the Federal Trade Commission?  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  I get two takeaways from this:  Another reminder that, in the absence of clear legislative boundaries for crypto, the SEC is striking out wherever it can to assert authority. It’s partly turf war, partly political posturing during a post-FTX moment in which crypto is a convenient whipping boy.  The crypto community has done a lousy job picking its friends and enemies within the U.S. government. Advocates should simultaneously work with the FTC to enforce a decentralized market structure for their own industry and with their allies in Congress to prevent the SEC from crimping mass adoption and undermining blockchain-based challenges to monopolies in other industries, such as finance and internet platforms. Instead, the industry fixates on the SEC as the bogeyman, a role in which Chairman Gary Gensler has seemed perfectly at home as his agency has launched a flurry of attention-grabbing actions against Binance/Paxos, Kraken, Terra-Luna and now the Voyager Digital creditors.  Head-scratcher  First, a look at the Binance-Paxos case.  On Feb. 13, Paxos confirmed it had received a Wells Notice from the SEC, indicating that enforcement action may be forthcoming, and separately announced that it would cease minting new BUSD tokens under order from the New York Department of Financial Services. After that, The Wall Street Journal reported the SEC intended to sue Paxos on grounds that BUSD is an unregistered security.  The SEC’s argument about the one-to-one dollar-pegged BUSD was baffling because it’s hard to see how a stable-value token meets the Howey Test, which, among other stipulations, says that, for an instrument to be a security, the buyer must have expectation of profit – i.e. that the asset is going to rise in value at some point.  Now there are scenarios where investors could profit from BUSD. If fears arose that Binance was failing to adequately maintain BUSD’s dollar reserves, its market price could fall below a dollar, allowing investors to speculate on an expected price recovery as the company moved to rejuvenate reserves and drive the token back to dollar parity.  But that scenario runs counter to Binance’s incentives. It’s never motivated to let BUSD’s price fall, since that would undermine trust in the token and reduce its market share. Paxos’ management said from the beginning that it “categorically disagrees” with the designation of BUSD as a security. And it seems hopeful it can get the SEC to back down, amid reports that its conversations with the agency are “constructive.”  But the Fortune account paints an alternative picture of alleged wrongdoing by Binance, arguing that in forcibly converting its exchange customers’ USDC and other stablecoins into BUSD tokens, it captured interest earnings on the reserves deposited against them that should have accrued to issuers of those competing coins. That sounds a bit like the issues that prompted the U.S. government’s landmark 2001 lawsuit against Microsoft (MSFT), when it accused the Redmond, Wash., giant of abusing its dominance of personal computers’ operating systems to give its own Internet Explorer browser an advantage over Netscape’s Navigator product.  Note: My point here is not to argue that Binance is guilty of monopolistic practices. It’s worth noting that in September, Binance openly announced it was converting competitors’ stablecoin to BUSD. Also, a company spokesperson told Fortune that while the company had “previously acknowledged that these processes have not always been flawless, at no time was the collateralization of user assets affected” – essentially denying the diversion of interest earnings. For the record, CoinDesk decided not to follow up on the Fortune story, which seemed more like a rehashing of those previous details than anything new.  What’s important here is whether regulators believed they had a case for action on monopolistic practices grounds. If so, once again, why was the SEC involved? That’s the question the crypto industry should strategically seize upon.  Crypto should be vehemently against monopolies  It’s a truism that in a market economy, all industry leaders are incentivized to seek monopolistic positions that hurt customers and competitors alike. It’s why the Theodore Roosevelt-era antitrust laws were so groundbreaking. They established a role for the U.S. government in asserting and protecting a public interest in market competition that, in some respects, went against the natural order of capitalism.  Crypto is no stranger to these problems – not because its business leaders are any more or less inclined to behave badly, but because, as in other industries, the biggest players are able to exploit their dominance. Where it differs from other industries is that crypto’s core foundations are built on resisting these centralizing tendencies, fostering perpetual tension between the ideal of decentralization and the reality of a tendency toward centralization. Hence the endless debates over cross-chain interoperability, trademarks, and the restrictions that some marketplaces impose on the resale of non-fungible tokens on competing platforms.  Read more: Crypto Regulatory Initiatives Show SEC’s Dominance Among US Regulators: JPMorgan  So why aren’t more crypto people engaging with government agencies such as the FTC to encourage competition?  Partly that’s because of a natural aversion to government generally. Non-interference aligns with a prominent capitalist-libertarian bent in the community, where the preference is for software developers to find disruptive, disintermediating ways of attacking monopolies without bringing in the distorting intervention of the state.  I think this is naive; as the past few months have demonstrated, the government has great power to curtail the advance of this industry. In the same vein, it has the power to help it. Crypto leaders should recognize that power and seek to harness it constructively.  Another explanation for a lack of antitrust policy engagement could be that the crypto lobbying movement is largely funded by for-profit crypto companies and their venture capitalist funders. They have an interest in protecting their dominant market positions.  Perhaps crypto lobbying needs a different funding model. Do decentralized autonomous organization structures make sense here, such that private wealthy interests are diluted by a wider body of many smaller contributors? Or is it just a case of the various representative organizations strengthening their independence charters and shifting priorities over the changes they seek and with whom they’ll work with?  Either way, something needs to change. It’s unacceptable that a single government agency is allowed to range beyond its jurisdiction and singlehandedly set this industry’s path.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Michael J.

42421351,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnskP,1677263262,Sam Bankman-Fried Cosplayed as a Genius. The Facts Reveal His Incredible Stupidity,"One nagging question about Sam Bankman-Fried and his FTX Crime Family has always been: what was the endgame? Given the incredible extent of the theft taking place, how did Bankman-Fried and his inner circle of co-conspirators foresee escaping their giant con with their freedom and dignity intact?  New charges filed Thursday against the disgraced effective altruist support the idea that he hoped to curry enough favor in Washington, D.C. to somehow escape the consequences of his actions. This strategy doesn’t withstand scrutiny – but then again, neither do most of Sam Bankman-Fried’s apparent goals or strategies, now that the reality behind his media facade is being revealed.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  This helps drive home a tricky but important point about many of the crypto wunderkinds who ascended to the heavens in 2021 and fell to Earth in 2022. Bankman-Fried represented himself, and was lauded in the media, as some kind of genius. Same goes for Terra con artist Do Kwon and Su “Bitcoin will only go up forever” Zhu, CEO of Three Arrows Capital.  In fact, though, these people were putting on an act – an impression. They leveraged credentials, relationships and theatrical self-representations to create what you might call “a dumb person’s idea of what a smart person looks like.” This helped attract huge amounts of money.  But it’s now clear Bankman-Fried and the rest weren't just unlucky. They were remarkably dumb.  Way down in the hole  Thursday’s superseding indictment from the U.S. Department of Justice adds very serious new charges, including investment fraud, banking fraud, wire fraud and election fraud, to Bankman-Fried’s already-long rap sheet. Sources told CNBC that Bankman-Fried could face an additional 40 years in prison based on the new charges, on top of the existing allegations.  The documents detail Bankman-Fried’s various false public statements about FTX’s risk management and custodial practices, which support both the investment and wire fraud allegations. Sam was certainly of the “go big or go home” school of fraud: He stated in front of no less than the U.S. Senate that ""as a general principle FTX segregates customer assets from its own assets across our platforms,"" even as he was secretly funneling customer deposits off the platform for FTX’s own uses (including sending donations to one-third of Congress).  The new charges also claim Bankman-Fried misrepresented FTX’s operation and the purpose of fiat bank accounts to U.S. regulated banks, which is an extremely serious allegation more associated with Mexican cartels and global terrorists than tech startups.  The most significant new charges address, in the words of the Southern District of New York, Bankman-Fried’s “unlawful political influence campaign, which involved flooding the political system with tens of millions of dollars in illegal contributions to both Democrats and Republicans made in the names of others in order to obscure the true source of the money and evade federal election law.”  See also: Sam Bankman-Fried's Altruism Wasn't Very Effective | Opinion  It might not be obvious, but this is a big, big deal. U.S. lawmakers, prosecutors and judges are understandably not huge fans of attempts to illegally subvert U.S. democracy (after all, they’ve created plenty of convenient, legal methods for doing so). The charges describe in depth the use of so-called “straw donors” to funnel FTX money (really, FTX user funds) to political campaigns by fraudulently representing them as donations from individuals, including two unnamed FTX executives.  Almost as a footnote, the charges detail incredibly brazen accounting fraud that flowed from the campaign finance fraud. Messages now in evidence show an unidentified FTX executive, referred to as CC-1, proposed backdating the sale of roughly $80 million in cryptocurrency to conceal the use of a personal bank account as a funnel for these fraudulent donations. (Public campaign finance records reported by CNBC strongly suggest that CC-1 is Nishad Singh, former FTX director of engineering.)  Fear the Reaper  All of this implies two ways Bankman-Fried may have been thinking about his long-term game plan. He may have simply thought he could do nothing but win, and that all the money he was stealing would magically regenerate somehow through his deranged financial and influence-peddling machinations. This species of stupidity would have flowed from Bankman-Fried’s apparently incurable case of elite delusion.  A more grounded theory of mind might suggest Bankman-Fried thought he could simply buy off politicians by funneling enough illegal, stolen donations to them. This is stupid in a more basic and embarrassing way: However cynical you may be about the U.S. justice system, relying on political connections for legal protection is a fairly poor strategy. Enron CEO Kenneth Lay was personal buddies with President George W. Bush. Elizabeth Holmes had Henry Kissinger on her board. They were both convicted nonetheless.  I’m reminded of Bankman-Fried’s declaration that “I would never read a book.” One wonders if he’s ever even heard of Enron, which collapsed when he was about 10 years old. (For that matter, one occasionally wonders if he's ever heard of ""accounting"".)  The foolishness of whatever plan was bonging around Bankman-Fried’s blissfully book-free skull was obvious to at least some inside the operation. Both a recent FT piece and the new charging documents describe Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison as essentially relieved when it all came crashing down.  “I just had an increasing dread of this day that was weighing on me for a long time,” Ellison wrote in a message seen by Bankman-Fried on or before Nov. 6. “And now that it’s actually happening it just feels great to get it over with one way or another.”  See also: The Faulty Moral Universe of Sam Bankman-Fried | Opinion  In other words, whatever ignorant delusions Bankman-Fried was and seemingly still is under, those around him saw what was happening as a fraud in real time. Caroline Ellison seemingly never had much hope of escaping dire fallout.  Bankman-Fried’s obliviousness to the inevitable consequences of his actions also invites a review of evidence that stimulants were widely used and abused within FTX’s top ranks. That includes a seemingly direct confirmation, posted by Caroline Ellison on Twitter:  This matters because, contrary to Ellison’s self-assessment, research shows that regular amphetamine use degrades cognition and judgment. One study specifically found that amphetamine abusers, like heroin abusers, were “profoundly … impaired on a test of pattern-recognition memory.” Pattern recognition sounds like it might be a significant skill for, oh I don’t know, a trading firm.  You might feel smarter when you’re tweaking, just as you feel perfectly safe to drive after three beers. You might also feel smart because you graduated from MIT, or because your parents are decorated scholars.

The bloc wants to avoid mistakes it says were made with internet policy in the past, as the EU’s executive arm prepares to set out its strategy on virtual worlds in a policy document due in May.  “We want to make sure that the developments that we see in virtual worlds are fully in line with our European values from the outset – values such as inclusion, respect of privacy, non-discrimination and equality,” Yvo Volman, director of data at the European Commission's digital department, DG Connect, said at an event hosted by the Commission in Brussels.  “We have to make sure that people feel safe in virtual worlds, as safe as they do in the real world or actually perhaps even safer,” he said. “We need to make sure that people have the right skills and tools to protect their assets in virtual worlds – their data.”  “We need to get it right from the start,” said Volman. “We need to avoid some mistakes that we perhaps have made with the advent of the internet.”  The EU has lately set out sweeping regulations to control the ability of big companies like Google and Amazon to dominate the online space.  Officials from the commission’s powerful antitrust department have already expressed concerns that similar things could occur in Web3 – such as from social media network company Facebook, which has rebranded itself as Meta Platforms as it seeks to create its own online virtual-reality space.

42393906,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brc3Px,1677251523,ReFi for the People: How Crypto Can Help Local Communities Help Their Ecosystems,"Suriname, a country in the northern part of South America, has a truly remarkable credential: It is one of three carbon-negative countries in the world, along with Bhutan and Panama. More than 97% of the country of 600,000 is covered by dense tropical forest that has escaped the deforestation trap of its neighbors, meaning it absorbs more carbon dioxide equivalent emissions that it puts out.  Not even this tiny, out-of-sight and out-of-mind nation can escape the pressures of globalization. Its residents are increasingly turning to logging and deforestation, often illegal, to better their livelihoods. Its entrepreneurs are looking for a solution in crypto.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s “BUIDL Week.”  A couple of projects in Suriname look to connect its indigenous communities, currently operating on the fringes of the financial and trade systems, with global markets through crypto. BioTara, founded and led by John Goedschalk, aims to “unlock the potential of Amazonia’s bio-economy by empowering local communities to engage in the global marketplace” through a franchising program. Locals set up manufacturing facilities that produce Amazonian goods, such as cosmetics, in a small-scale and sustainable way.  Blockchain is key in two ways, Goedschalk says. It provides “radical traceability and transparency by logging every step on-chain” while crypto directs the proceeds from the franchises ”to the communities who are often ‘unbankable’ or financially excluded and marginalized.”  ReFi renaissance  In the past year or so, crypto-hippies, climate scientists and everyone in between have been building what they’ve dubbed regenerative finance (ReFi). This breed of crypto project aims to build economic systems that revive nature instead of “degenerating” it and harming the people that live in it.  A lot of the efforts in this space have focused around carbon offsets or credits: financial instruments representing allowed carbon emissions or reductions in emissions (e.g., reforestation) traded in voluntary markets such as Gold Standard or Verra. These have often been found to be of low quality and offer no additional carbon reductions. The idea is that putting these assets on a blockchain brings transparency and traceability to an otherwise opaque market, boosting market participation along the way.  There is another idea: a hyper-localized brand of ReFi. Using technology, local communities can be organized to pool their resources in a governable organization, building ecosystems that can avoid extractive systems. In the BioTara example, blockchain brings supply chain traceability and crypto facilitates access to global markets.  In others, blockchain and tokenization either enable the formation and governance of these organizations or create trustworthy systems of monitoring and reporting. Blockchains such as Cosmos, Hedera Hashgraph, Celo, Regen Network and Topl are key to this equation.  Exactly where the technology figures into some of these projects is somewhat TBD or to be built. Many of them, such as ReFi Barichara in Colombia, have started out focused on building regenerative ecosystems working with local communities, which is a huge undertaking. “The secret sauce is in the synergy between weaving projects and local communities,” said Antonio Paglino, who leads ReFi Barichara, another region of Colombia that is currently in the early stages of being “regenerated” through a collaboration between the local community and crypto.  Many of these ReFi projects are now at the stages where they are working out exactly how and where to add crypto to the mix.  Read more: In the Colombian Andes, Figuring Out How Crypto Can Save the Climate  But the model has just started to promulgate around the world, with seed-stage projects popping up anywhere from Suriname’s BioTara and KOKODao in Colombia to Shamba Network in Africa.  Investment obstacles  Putting this to work is not an easy process – and it is not immune to pitfalls common to traditional investment vehicles.  First, it is hard to convince investors to fund the projects. “Folks are looking for silver bullets as opposed to the step-by-step work of reconfiguring value and supply chains,” said BioTara’s Goedschalk.  The market for these tokens either doesn’t exist or is quite small, making investment into the projects a hard sell. The space needs “capital which is strategic, thoughtful, experimental and long-term oriented,” Lucia Gallardo, CEO of Emerge, a group building tech for sustainable impact, said.  At the same time, attracting investment from public crypto markets is often not a suitable option. “Web3 ‘degens’ expect to find in ReFi projects the same utility and short-term returns that other Web3 [non-fungible token] projects offer,” said Ana Maria Mahecha, founder of KOKODao, which aims to protect small scale forests in Colombia.  Lessons from Toucan/KlimaDAO  For example, KlimaDAO and Toucan Protocol tried to turbo-charge carbon neutrality using blockchain – but dumping their carbon credits on crypto markets turned out to be a wilder ride than they had anticipated.  KlimaDAO is a major project in the broader ReFi space, which launched in 2021 with much fanfare and $17 million in funding. The idea was to create a digital reserve currency backed by natural assets, specifically carbon credits/offsets. KlimaDAO used on-chain carbon offsets issued by another protocol, Toucan, which takes off-chain carbon credits from Verra into its Polygon-based platform.  Together, KlimaDAO and Toucan would bring “transparency and market activity within what is currently an opaque, heavily intermediated market, while empowering everyday people to participate in climate action and scale this key market,” said KlimaDAO’s Natacha Rousseau.  Toucan did a “mass rebalancing” within a couple of months of its launch due to the risk of arbitrage between the different tokens it issued.  A few months later, millions in carbon credits had flowed into the system. Many of these were found to be related to long-dormant green projects of low quality. Because they could be traded for KlimaDAO’s token, which was valued more highly than the original Verra credits, traders could make a quick buck with little climate-positive effects. Verra eventually halted the tokenization of its retired offsets on Toucan in May 2022.  The storm passed, and KlimaDAO said in October it has locked in more than 18 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, or about 2% of Verra’s voluntary carbon market. Verra has also softened its stance, and it closed a public consultation on carbon tokenization in January.  Reality check  Protecting these community-driven ReFi projects from “degenerative” systems is a challenge in itself. “We need deeper discussions on underlying incentives and value dynamics to ensure we aren’t just digitizing and distributing the same processes that got us to where we are today,” Gallardo said.  This means that the space needs “deeper innovation” than simply digitizing or tokenizing natural assets and hoping the markets will work it out. Gallardo added there are particular gaps around data collection to assess the impact and unintended consequences of projects.  There is often a “disconnect” between the Web3 projects and on-the-ground needs, such as the fact that many people don’t have smartphones so most crypto wallets are of no use to them, Mahecha said.  On top of that, each “indigenous community has its own idiosyncrasy, so the amount of individual work that needs to be done for a specific community to accept any of these ReFi tools is huge and very labor intensive,” Mahecha said.  Often, being accepted by these groups is not an easy process. Mahecha described the hesitancy of locals to participate. The particular region of Colombia she is working on has been ravaged by war for the past few decades, which only intensifies people’s guardedness towards strangers. Once they get to know the team and start seeing that the model works, they open their arms, she said.  Still, proponents of ReFi think they can truly make a difference in the world – and perhaps rehabilitate crypto’s ever-worsening image.  Read more: ReFi Is Going Mainstream  “We need to be collectively talking about regenerative finance at all levels – from peer-to-peer relationships all the way up to the international macroeconomic landscape,” Gallardo said. While blockchain can help with some of this, “integrating crypto to existing ecological initiatives does not automatically mean it is applied regenerative finance. [...] We must be intentional and thoughtful about how we are re-imagining value.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/02/24/refi-for-the-people-how-crypto-can-help-local-communities-help-their-ecosystems,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2c9e13252d4083ab4668648cda0e4b482a65e997-1600x899.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The PCE Price Index for January rose 5.4% from a year ago, compared with a 5.3% increase in December. The January number was far stronger than economist forecasts of a 5.0% increase. The core rate, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 4.7% versus 4.6% in December and was higher than the estimated 4.3% growth.  On a monthly basis, the PCE Price Index gained 0.6% in January, up from 0.2% in December and against expectations for a 0.5% increase. The core rate also rose 0.6% in January, versus a 0.4% increase in December and forecasts for a 0.4% rise.  Risky assets fell following the report, with bitcoin (BTC) shedding about $200 to $23,730 and threatening to fall to $23,000, which would be its lowest level of this week. Nasdaq 100 futures were down 1.9%, and S&P 500 futures were lower by 1.4%.  In addition, crypto-related stocks are off sharply. Coinbase (COIN), MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Marathon Digital (MARA) are all lower by 5%-8%.  Though severely backward looking – this report is for January – the gauge of personal consumer expenditures remains the Fed's favored inflation indicator. Following the report, odds of a 50 basis point rate hike (as opposed to 25 basis points) at the Fed's next policy meeting in March are rising, with traders now nearly evenly split between the two choice, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. As recently as one month ago, there was roughly a 100% expectation of a 25 basis point move in March.  Though remaining elevated, inflation during late 2022 had been trending lower, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell saying in January he was seeing signs of a disinflation trend. This report could call that into question.  ""Inflation remains stubborn and sticky between 4%-5%,"" tweeted RSM Chief Economist Joe Brusuelas. ""Service inflation continues to increase with goods disinflation cooling. [The] risk of a March 50 basis point hike [is] rising and we are clearing moving toward a 5.5% policy peak at a minimum.""

42421344,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnseD,1677248306,How to Use a DAO to Build a Web3 Community,"What even is a DAO? A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a global collaboration tool that allows communities to make decisions in a decentralized, transparent and accountable manner by recording activities on a blockchain.  It’s a general purpose solution that uses general purpose technologies – like those smart contracts you may have heard of – to automate general activities. This form of “decentralized governance” promotes a more inclusive and equitable distribution of power. In other words, DAOs allow for greater collaboration and cooperation among members.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s “BUIDL Week.” Arjun Krishan Kalsy is the head of ecosystem at Mantle.  Today, in the crypto industry, DAOs have started to provide incentives for contributors (like a governance token that trades on the open market, or even paychecks) with the idea being to align individual and collective desires. The hope is that better decisions are made at scale.  DAOs also provide a powerful tool for community building. Members of a DAO can share resources, knowledge and skills in a way that benefits the entire organization. DAOs, vehicles for global collaboration, are potent tools when they’re built correctly.  Ecosystem building using DAOs  A Web3 project is only as good as its community and ecosystem. That’s because Web3 projects are open source and thus require global participation in order to evolve and grow.  How do you hack global participation? You go and build a global community.  What happens when you have a large and participative community? This attracts other builders and projects to come and build with you.  Et voila! Now you have built an ecosystem which in terms of participants has users, builders and projects, all of whom are now transacting with each other and thereby creating a healthy economy.  Let’s break down the steps above and try to go a few levels deeper.  To tokenize?  Step one in the process is to build a global community of people who believe in your vision and want to contribute and participate in the idea or project. This is a marketing and communication problem that requires the founding team to clearly communicate the value of what it is building and most importantly, why it is building it.  This is where DAOs are especially effective. The ability to bind together a group of people globally within a construct that allows both for decision making and transparent execution is crucial to making this kind of a system work. Furthermore, every DAO member is also incentivized in some sense to make the community larger so that more work can be done and better decisions can be made.  Injecting a token into this construct creates incentives that allows a DAO to prioritize different aspects of its growth, meaning both the community and its product portfolio. It may also attract builders (perhaps interested in both profit and community). As the quality and quantity of projects improves, there is momentum for other builders to join the DAO.  See also: What Are VCs Funding After FTX? More Decentralized Infrastructure / BUIDL Week  Marketing incentives  Step two is where things really become interesting. When more and more participants enter the fray, DAOs take on a life of their own. At some point, it may be appropriate to call the community and its suite of projects an “ecosystem.”  Running an ecosystem invariably requires a system of incentives to keep everyone aligned – or as aligned as possible. Web3 ecosystems tend to grow horizontally, due to the established ethos that protocols should be “composable.” Composability is the process of when projects build on top of each other, increasing the value and utility they provide to all users.  Similarly, DAO communities can also be said to scale horizontally as its membership grows. The larger the community, the more decentralized its decision making. In a sense, this natural state of growth means DAO members have the responsibility to market the DAO and grow its membership. At scale, this is a powerful force leading to even faster ecosystem growth.  Equal opportunity  To unleash the full potential of DAOs, more agile governance structures need to be figured out that allow everyone to have their voice heard and participate in equitable decision making that offers equal opportunities to everyone. We will continue to see innovation in this space as newer governance structures are tried out to improve a DAO’s agility and decentralization.  DAOs are rapidly emerging as a powerful tool for Web3 ecosystem building. Further, open source protocols provide the right incentives for collaboration among multiple organizations and communities – increasing collective traction and leading to better decisions at scale.  By combining these two powerful forces of decentralization and ecosystem building, DAOs are well set to become one of the biggest growth engines in the Web3 space.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET,Arjun Krishan Kalsy,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/02/24/how-to-use-a-dao-to-build-a-web3-community,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b95d3ddec0e1876de06f2ac623d55f2f29307acd-1330x748.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The move is part of a broader plan to make FLOKI, which was originally a meme coin named after billionaire Elon Musk's pet dog, as a serious decentralized-finance (DeFi) token.  Venus provides a simple-to-use crypto asset lending and borrowing product that allows users to directly borrow against collateral at a high speed while losing less to transaction fees. It held over $800 million in locked tokens as of Friday.  Venus will be integrating FLOKI in its money-market platform, thereby allowing FLOKI holders on the BNB Chain to borrow USDT, USDC, BNB and a basket of other cryptocurrencies while using their FLOKI tokens as collateral.  This allows FLOKI token holders to easily access liquidity without having to sell their tokens.  The move is expected to benefit FLOKI holders, developers say, as they continue to build and seek strategic partnerships that ultimately benefit the token’s value.  The FLOKI integration process on Venus has started, and is expected to be completed in March. After that, FLOKI holders will be able to seamlessly lend and borrow on Venus while using their FLOKI tokens as collateral.  FLOKI has so far been one of the strongest crypto performers this year, tripling in value over a 30-day rolling period, according to CoinGecko. Interest in the tokens has heightened in recent months following a $100 million token burn and a push to target Valhalla, Floki’s metaverse game, to the multibillion-dollar Chinese gaming market.",POSITIVE,BNB | FLOKI,BLOCKCHAIN | SHIB | TRADING | BNB | FLOKI,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/24/bnb-chains-second-largest-defi-protocol-venus-to-accept-floki-tokens-as-lending-collateral,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b4dd6f7d5f62eb07ad6de1986b99fe0a04ad581f-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42414348,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB4T4E,1677245584,FATF Agrees on Action Plan to Drive Implementation of Global Crypto Norms,"The Financial Action Task Force has agreed on an action plan to drive the ""timely implementation"" of its global standards for crypto, a report from its recent plenary meeting shows.  The plenary for the global money-laundering and financial crimes watchdog is made up of 206 members, including observer organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, United Nations and Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units.  In Friday's document, the watchdog noted that many countries have failed to implement its norms, including its controversial “travel rule,” which requires services providers to collect and share information of crypto transactions..  ""The plenary thus agreed on a road map to strengthen implementation of FATF standards on virtual assets and virtual asset service providers, which will include a stocktake of current levels of implementation across the global network,"" the FATF said, adding that a report on its findings is due in the first half of 2024.  FATF published its updated standards for crypto in 2019, but last June, it said only 11 of 98 surveyed jurisdictions were enforcing the travel rule and urged them to act faster.  The report also noted that strong crypto regulation is key to disrupting financial flows from ransomware exploits, adding that ""criminals responsible are getting away undetected with large amounts of money, predominantly using virtual assets.""  In its country-specific recommendations – mostly addressing sanctions compliance – the FATF said Jordan ""should continue to work on implementing its action plan to address its strategic deficiencies"" for assessing money-laundering risks involving crypto.

The test network for the Ethereum scaling tool experienced problems related to an issue with Coinbase wallets, which incorrectly estimated how much gas was required to execute transactions, meaning the transactions couldn’t be processed. Plus, Coinbase software engineer Roberto Bayardo said that high demand from users overwhelmed the protocol. Base forms the core of Coinbase’s strategy to expand into the developer business in order to diversify its revenue.  Yearn Finance’s YFI token surged to its highest level in nearly six months Friday after developers said they will introduce a liquid staking derivatives token. YFI surpassed $10,000 in Asian morning hours to prices not seen since September 2022, as part of a 39% increase this week, with trading volume increasing fivefold. Developers said the forthcoming token would give users exposure to a basket of liquid staking derivatives, which analysts say can help active investors diversify risk.  The Litecoin Foundation will work with Metalpha Technology (MATH), a Nasdaq-listed wealth manager, to develop less carbon-intensive mining products for the Litecoin ecosystem. The partnership will focus on facilitating renewable energy use and increasing energy efficiency. Metalpha will also develop financial derivative products for LTC tokens and support miners with hedging products against market risk.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the number of transactions on Ethereum layer 2 scaling tools Arbitrum and Optimism has surpassed that on Ethereum's mainnet for the first time on record.  The data shows an increased preference for cheaper and faster layer 2s because of rising fees on Ethereum. Average transaction fees on Ethereum have tripled since November, according to IntoTheBlock.  ""Progress towards a roll-up centric Ethereum is already on its way and is bound to continue to accelerate with Base's upcoming launch,"" IntoTheBlock said in the weekly report published early Friday.  - Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  Why Nigerians Aren't Turning to the eNaira Despite Crippling Cash Shortages  Coinbase Joins the Ethereum Layer 2 Rat Race – Can It Grow?

Bitcoin has surged over 45% so far this year, outperforming traditional risky assets, including Wall Street's tech-heavy Nasdaq index, by a significant margin. Futures typically trade at a premium in a sign of leverage being skewed on the bullish side when the underlying asset is appreciating in value. Conversely, during bear markets, discounts are often observed.  ""The bull is back,"" Arcane Research analyst Vetle Lunde told CoinDesk.  CME takes the lead  Historically, futures on the CME have traded at a relatively lower premium than those on Binance and other unregulated offshore entities, predominantly because these latter avenues offered higher leverage. That means traders on offshore exchanges were able to take bigger bullish bets while depositing a relatively small amount of money, called a margin.  Offshore exchanges, however, have cut back on leverage since the second half of 2021, and they now account for just 30% of the global futures activity, while the rest comes from the CME.  Another reason the CME has flipped offshore exchanges is that futures-based exchange-traded funds tied to bitcoin invest only in regulated CME futures contracts.  According to Arcane Research, open interest, or the number of open futures contracts on the CME, sits at 80,586 BTC – or 70% of the global open interest. That's significantly higher than 28% during the height of the bull run in April 2021.  ""It is rare to see CME futures trade at a [higher] premium,"" Lunde said. ""With that in mind, CME is a huge part of BTC futures activity as a whole. The offshore futures market is insignificantly small now, with all activity concentrated in perpetuals.""  Looking forward, a continued move higher in the premium may see carry traders return to the market. The cash-and-carry arbitrage involves buying bitcoin in the spot market and simultaneously selling futures contracts in a bid to pocket the premium. Carry trading was quite popular during the bull run when premiums reached as high as 40% on offshore exchanges.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/24/bitcoin-futures-on-cme-trade-at-highest-premium-since-november-2021-binance-futures-lag,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cf779fef3f46513f7c4f5b88ac4803bde5158893-3054x1659.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Mango has been offline since it suffered an exploit in October that resulted in $114 million being siphoned out of the exchange after its pricing oracles were manipulated.  In an attempt to avoid another attack, Mango will impose new limits on the multi-sig wallet, which will allow the developers to respond to ""unforeseen market dynamics"" and any vulnerabilities in the program code.  ""All other changes to the program need to be approved by all holders of the DAO,"" the exchange said in a tweet, using the acronym for a decentralized autonomous organization.  In the event of unforeseen market conditions, Mango's security council can put the protocol into ""post-only mode"" to limit deposits, purchases, lending and position increases. The DAO can then vote on whether to halt trades, force settlement or update risk parameters.  The exchange, which processed over $28 billion in transactions from its inception to when it was halted, is expected to put its v4 product into beta mode over the coming months, although a definitive date isn't set.

42414342,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB4ST5,1677240000,Crypto Wallet Firm Dfns Says ‘Magic Links’ Have Critical Vulnerability,"Some magic links – a passwordless sign-in method embraced by a growing number of crypto wallets and web apps – have a critical vulnerability, according to the crypto wallet startup Dfns.  Dfns offers wallet services and is backed by firms including White Star Capital, Hashed, Susquehanna, Coinbase Ventures and ABN AMRO.  A magic link is a unique, one-time-use URL that is generated by a website or app to authenticate a user without requiring them to enter a password. When a user clicks on a magic link sent to them by a web app, it verifies their identity and logs them into their account.  Initially spearheaded by Slack and other popular Web2 apps, magic links have become an increasingly common sign-in method for crypto wallets. Instead of requiring users to remember a complex key or seed phrase, magic links are promoted as a quicker, simpler and safer way to log in.  But Dfns says magic links – which can be implemented differently from app to app – are often vastly less secure than more traditional sign-in methods.  Dfns categorizes the vulnerability it discovered as a “zero day” exploit – so severe as to essentially render magic links toxic for developers. Given the ubiquity of magic links beyond just crypto wallets (they’re used by some popular password managers, for example), Dfns said in a statement that the vulnerability could “​​pose a considerable risk to a substantial portion of the global economy.”  Services impacted by the vulnerability, however, significantly downplayed its risk to CoinDesk, calling it a more benign – albeit still worrisome – breed of phishing attack. Multiple popular wallets, moreover, complained that Dfns gave them as little as three days’ notice before rushing to publicize their findings, well short of commonly accepted standards for vulnerability disclosure. They added, moreover, that Dfns has a vested interest in disparaging passwordless wallet services; Dfns’ business model involves safeguarding crypto passwords for its customers.  While not everyone agreed with Dfns' characterization of the severity of its findings, individuals who spoke to CoinDesk noted that the findings did highlight how some growth-obsessed cryptocurrency companies have prioritized convenience over security in a bid to attract users.  “Back in the early 2000s, usernames and passwords were constantly compromised. But today we have two-factor authentication, OTP (one-time-passwords),” and other more secure sign-in methods, Web3Auth CEO Zhen Yu Yong told CoinDesk. (Web3Auth offers a paswordless sign-in service that was vulnerable to the Dfns-discovered exploit.) The crypto industry ""is very much still using single-factor seed phrases – single-factor authentication.”  Hijacking magic links  In a demonstration over Zoom, Dfns Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) Dr. Samer Fayssal showed how a hacker can hijack popular “magic link” crypto wallet services using just a user’s email address.  Using a fresh CoinDesk burner wallet as a test dummy, Faysall demonstrated how a hacker could send a magic link that appeared (and was, in a sense) genuine. The link came from the wallet service’s real email address and clicking on it logged into the CoinDesk burner wallet.  But when Fayssal shared his screen, he showed that by clicking on the link, CoinDesk had inadvertently given him full access to its wallet.  With two Dnfs lawyers on the line (apparently to attest to the fact that Dfns was not actually hacking CoinDesk), Fayssal agreed to repeat his attack on another passwordless crypto wallet service.  In both of his demonstrations, Fayssal – not CoinDesk – initiated the sign-in request that triggered a magic link email. If a user receives a log-in email without actually trying to log into a service, this is typically a phishing red flag – even if the email appears completely authentic.  Fayssal would not explain how he pulled the attacks off, telling CoinDesk that he didn’t want his methods to get into the wrong hands. He said, however, that he has personally reached out to more than a dozen companies he believes are vulnerable to the exploit and has offered to help them implement safeguards.  As for users of magic link wallets, “the advice I would give users is to implement two-factor authentication as soon as possible, if possible,” said Fayssal.  CoinDesk spoke with three of the crypto companies that Dfns identified as users of magic links. All of them confirmed that Fayssal’s findings were authentic, but they all said Dfns was overplaying its hand by calling the attack a “zero day.”  Magic Labs, one of the companies Dfns used in its demo, said a day later it was no longer vulnerable.  ""Magic Labs no longer has vulnerability to this type of phishing, and, to our knowledge, none of our end-users have been affected,"" said Sean Li, CEO of Magic Labs. ""We’re constantly evaluating and improving the security of our platform.""  Zero day or phishing attack?  Web3Auth was the other crypto wallet service that Dfns used to demonstrate the magic link vulnerability to CoinDesk. In the opinion of Web3Auth’s Yong, the magic link vulnerability doesn’t qualify as a more severe “zero day” exploit because the user needs to click on a hijacked magic link in order for it to work.  “We see this as a phishing attack,” Yong told CoinDesk. “It’s similar to a phishing attack on MetaMask, where there’s a dapp [decentralized app] that sends a malicious transaction, the user approves it, then the user might send their tokens to a malicious address or something.”  The magic link attack fails if the user misses the hijacked email, clicks on the link after it expires, or finds it suspicious that they’d been sent a magic link when they hadn’t tried to log in. (As to this last point, Fayssal says that an attacker could strategically time the link to arrive around when a user might be expected to log into the target service.)  Yong told CoinDesk that Web3Auth has safeguards to prevent phishing, though he admitted that these safeguards weren’t enough to fend against Fayssal’s vulnerability.  To Web3Auth’s credit, however, the firm has text at the bottom of its magic link emails specifying the IP address that initiated a sign-in attempt. In Fayssal’s demonstration, his hijacked magic link came from a different IP address than CoinDesk’s – an easy-to-miss hint that the link was fraudulent even though the email came directly from Web3Auth.  Yong said Web3Auth would implement additional anti-phishing methods in light of Fayssal’s research.  Sequence, a web3 development platform that offers a passwordless crypto wallet, told CoinDesk that it put safeguards in place that rendered the Dfns-discovered vulnerability ineffective. “For Sequence, I don't think it's as bad at all,” said Peter Kieltyka, CEO at Horizon, the company that builds Sequence. “But you know, yeah, for some other products, I think they could take additional measures.”  Peter accused Dfns of exaggerating the severity of the magic link vulnerability as a “marketing stunt.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/24/crypto-wallet-firm-dfns-says-magic-links-have-critical-vulnerability,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/94278931c131460baec683176f8d9b9f7a2d3adb-1919x1079.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The slideshow, published for a meeting, says other uses such as paying taxes, receiving welfare payments or even paying in physical stores would follow in a later.  The ECB is one of many jurisdictions from around the world considering whether to issue a central bank digital currency, or CBDC. It is scheduled to make a formal decision later this year – but its officials are already thrashing out technical options and say that a digital euro will need to have multiple applications to address user needs and market gaps.  “In practical terms, a staggered approach would contribute to ensure a smooth end-user payment experience” and “reduce the implementation complexities” of trying to roll out new systems all at once, said the document, which was produced by the ECB’s digital euro project team.  The initial release of a digital euro would be for e-commerce and for peer-to-peer payments made among private individuals, the document said. Officials on the team have previously said use cases like paying wages, or applications that could align with decentralized finance, should be considered only in a later phase.  Free money  Using the digital euro for private individuals should be free for basic applications like onboarding and making payments, a separate document produced for the same meeting said – but it added there could be new laws to discourage banks from charging merchants too much for use.  Payment service providers “would be able to charge merchants,” but “legislation might establish an expectation on merchant pricing considering the current levels for comparable retail payment solutions,” the document said.  That broadly mirrors current arrangements for handling cash, although European Union laws known as the Single Euro Payments Area and Interchange Fee Regulation limit the charges that banks and card operators can make for bank transfers and credit card payments.

42410820,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggrtRB,1677233662,Why Nigerians Aren't Turning to the eNaira Despite Crippling Cash Shortages,"Nigeria is struggling with severe cash shortages, with riots erupting across the country just days before a presidential election – but people are still not turning to the national digital currency, the eNaira, which promised to improve retail payments.  The digital iteration of the naira, which was issued by the Central Bank of Nigeria in October 2021, hasn’t had the most impressive start and adoption has been slow. But even if people in Nigeria wanted to turn to the eNaira, transaction options with the central bank digital currency, or CBDC, are limited.  “They want to put it out there to get people to use it, but people don't have enough places to use it,” said Nigerian native Adesoji Solanke, a director at Renaissance Capital, an emerging and frontier markets-focused investment bank that has a branch in Nigeria.  There may be a dearth of merchants willing to accept the eNaira, according to London-based Varun Paul, CBDC and market infrastructure director at institutional crypto custody platform Fireblocks. Paul, who previously worked at the Bank of England as an economist and head of its fintech hub, is now leading Fireblocks’ efforts to build out infrastructure for CBDC integration.  “So you have this chicken and egg problem,” he said.  Cash shortages  At the end of 2022, outgoing President Muhammadu Buhari’s government decided to change the currency design and swap out old bank notes for new ones. The slow changeover caused ATMs to dry out quickly, and the government placed limits on withdrawals.  The country’s $220 billion informal economy stalled, and as the crisis worsened, the already weak naira fell even further against the U.S. dollar on the local forex black market.  Nigeria’s informal economy thrives on cash, and so cash shortages have left everyone from street vendors to bus drivers frustrated, Solanke added.  While protests in Nigerian cities turned violent, citizens also took to Twitter to complain about not being able to access basic necessities like fuel or food without cash.  Read more: Nigeria’s Bitcoin Premiums May Better Reflect Country’s Demand for the Dollar, Not Crypto  Low adoption  A year after the launch of the eNaira, less than 0.5% of Nigerians were using it, Bloomberg reported. By last August, the eNaira was used to carry out transactions worth 4 billion naira ($9.3 million). Comparatively, in 2020, Nigerians conducted $26 billion worth of ATM transactions.  Since then, the central bank has tried to push adoption. The Central Bank of Nigeria announced in December that it would limit cash withdrawals for individuals and corporate organizations to 100,000 naira ($217.19) and 500,000 naira ($1,085.97) respectively by January, and encouraged banks to turn customers to cash alternatives like the eNaira.  Despite the central bank's efforts, people haven't turned to the eNaira as a solution during the current cash shortage because the necessary infrastructure wasn't in place to foster adoption, both Solanke and Paul said.  “I think there's a couple of things they may have wished they did better,” Paul said, referring to Nigeria’s leaders. “One is they went out faster than anyone else, whereas other central banks around the world are researching a lot longer.”  People might have needed to be educated more on the benefits of a digital naira, according to Paul. In June 2021, Nigeria announced it may be kicking off a CBDC pilot program before the end of that year, and a Central Bank of Nigeria official said the institution had been researching a digital currency for two years. Just four months later, the eNaira went live.  Meanwhile, the European Union set up a two-year research and experimentation project for a digital euro ahead of deciding whether to issue one. If it does decide to go ahead, officials have said it could take several more years to launch. The U.K. is seeking public feedback on its recently published multiyear plan for a digital pound.  Internet access  In addition to issues of infrastructure, not everyone can readily access the eNaira, Solanke said.  “The challenge is that the wallet requires you to have a smartphone and use the internet, but think of the people you're trying to send money to, they're relatively poor, right?” Solanke said. “So the cost of the smartphone, the cost of the internet, these are just some of the hindrances to get some of these things up and running.“  Estimates show the number of Nigerians with a smartphone may be anywhere between 25 and 40 million. Africa’s most populous nation, Nigeria is home to more than 219 million, with nearly half over the age of 18 and old enough to have a phone.  There have been some attempts at expanding infrastructure digital payments with the eNaira. In September 2022, popular African payments platform Flutterwave added the currency as a payment option for merchants.  Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that the central bank was on the lookout for new tech partners to build out a new system to support the eNaira.  But Solanke said that “there's a lot of work that needs to happen both at the customer end and also at the merchant end to really get it up and running,” something Nigeria's next president will have to grapple with.  Nigerians are set to vote for a new president on Saturday in what could be one of the most competitive elections the West African country has seen in recent years.

YFI jumped from $7,200 earlier in the week to more than $10,000 in Asian morning hours on Friday, climbing to levels not seen since September 2022.  Yearn developers said on Tuesday that a forthcoming token will give users exposure to a basket of ether liquid staking derivatives (LSD) as the sector gains favor among investors.  “Introducing yETH, an LSD of LSDs. Get exposure to a basket of LSDs in one token. Spread your risk. Boosted yields,” Yearn tweeted. Yearn did not immediately respond to requests for additional comment.  Some analysts say that such tokens can help active crypto investors diversify risk, which may be driving demand for YFI.  ""yETH essentially spreads the risk across the various Ethereum LSDs while also earning additional yields through Yearn’s large veCRV position for Curve Pools,"" pseudonymous crypto investor DeFi Maestro told CoinDesk in a Twitter message. ""This means that yETH will always have higher yields compared to other LSDs and puts Yearn in a prime spot to capture a large portion of the LSD market that will accrue additional fees to veYFI stakers.""  Curve is a stablecoin swapping service, while veYFI and veCRV refer to derivative tokens issued to stakers who lock up YFI and Curve's CRV tokens for a period of time to increase platform liquidity in exchange for yield rewards.  Understanding Yearn and liquid staking  Yearn is a set of protocols working in conjunction with the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to maximize their passive earnings on their crypto assets through lending and trading services. YFI is Yearn’s governance token. It allows holders to vote on protocol upgrades or the introduction of new products and yield strategies.  Liquid staking refers to the exchange of staked ether for tokenized versions of ether that can be used in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Uses range from collateral for loans or margin trading to earning yield.  The LSD sector has performed handsomely in the past two months ahead of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade, which will allow investors to withdraw their ether staked on the Ethereum blockchain. Staked ether cannot currently be withdrawn or freely traded.  Tokens in the sector, such as Lido’s LDO, Stader’s SD and Rocket Pool’s RPL, have seen prices more than quadruple in the past few months as they gained favor among investors.  Tokens of all these products can be used in protocol governance or increasing yield based on the number of tokens held by an investor – which drives value for such tokens.",POSITIVE,ETH | YFI,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING | YFI,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/24/yfi-sets-six-month-high-as-yearn-finance-teases-ether-liquid-staking-product,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/20b261829d99a4ace9a33dd95e6b5c03b8bfebb3-4369x2457.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The news has lit a fire under the cryptocurrencies from the Optimism ecosystem.  Data from CoinGecko shows VELO, the native token of the Optimism-based decentralized exchange Velodrome Finance, has gained 21% in the past 24 hours. The token has more than doubled in the past seven days. Velodrome is the ninth-largest decentralized exchange in the world, accounting for 2.5% of the total market volume.  Optimism-native lending protocol Sonne Finance's SONNE token has jumped 82%, taking its seven-day rally to over 300%.  OPX, the governance and utility token of OPX Finance, has skyrocketed by 144%, while perpetual-focused decentralized exchange Perpetual Protocol's PERP token has seen a 42% rise in its market value. Other lesser-known names like THALE, HND, RING and PICKLE have also chalked up double-digit gains in the past 24 hours.  Optimism's OP token has jumped over 10%, reaching a two-week high of $3.10, CoinDesk data shows.  Coinbase launched the testnet version of its new Ethereum layer 2 scaling product, Base, announcing that it will be interoperable with other blockchains like Solana but won't have its native token.  ""Base aims to be decentralized, permissionless and open to anyone with the vision of creating a standard, modular, rollup agnostic Superchain powered by Optimism,"" the exchange said. ""We're joining Optimism as a core dev on the open source OP Stack and working to create a thriving community of other developers.""  The speculation on Crypto Twitter is that Coinbase is making a know-your-customer-based decentralized-finance (DeFi) portal with the help of Optimism, which will open doors for institutional participation in democratized finance.  Coinbase's foray into the world of Ethereum layer 2 comes a year after the exchange launched a non-fungible tokens marketplace. According to data from Analytics Insight, Coinbase Ventures is one of the most active venture-capital firms in crypto, with more than 240 investments.  So, observers are optimistic about Base evolving as a go-to place for decentralized applications.  ""The collaboration strives to upgrade Optimism Mainnet, Base, and other L2s to an initial superchain,"" pseudonymous analyst Route2FI tweeted.

The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan granted a civil forfeiture request for approximately $1.8 million in today’s value of cryptocurrencies that were seized in May 2022 as part of an operation to disrupt a cash pipeline that funneled the proceeds of narcotics sales to Mexico via stablecoins.  Court filings and source familiar with the matter say that the cash couriers would deposit money generated from drug trafficking, use Binance to purchase USDT as well as bitcoin (BTC), and then send the crypto to a designated address controlled by a criminal organization in Mexico.  Six Binance accounts were named in the criminal complaint.  A source that works with law enforcement on these matters said that the relationship between Binance and the DEA is “pretty tight.” DEA officials and Binance staff regularly meet to share intelligence, which is used to calibrate Binance’s anti-money laundering policies and assist DEA operations, the individual said.

Hedging is a risk management strategy employed to offset losses in investments by taking an opposite position in a related asset.  Crypto mining is a resource-intensive activity that relies on powerful computers to process and validate transactions for proof-of-work blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Litecoin. Miners receive the network’s tokens as a reward, which are typically sold on the open market to cover extensive costs and turn profits.  However, a drop in crypto prices has lead to churn for miners as they are unable to convert the high costs. This is where hedging comes in, allowing miners to continue operations by generating money regardless of market movements.  Meanwhile, Metalpha and Litecoin Foundation added they will work with universities and research institutions to further sustainable blockchain innovation, support public education around the Litecoin network, and improve network awareness, adoption and scalability.",POSITIVE,LTC,LTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING | RESEARCH,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/24/litecoin-foundation-partners-with-digital-asset-manager-metalpha-to-develop-hedging-products-for-ltc-miners,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f86f0f7aeaf8ea67d8d0464ecc9cab1a434d05d1-3594x2022.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Base Protocol’s BASE tokens jumped, then dumped, in the past 24 hours following an announcement by crypto exchange Coinbase about the launch of its layer 2 blockchain Base.  Base, which has a tiny $1 million market capitalization as per CoinMarketCap, spiked from $1.90 in European hours on Thursday to over $6.80 after Coinbase’s Base was announced – a gain of as much as 250% for early participants.  Prices gradually corrected amid heavy profit taking, with BASE dropping overnight to trade just over $2 in Asian morning hours on Friday.  The jump came with a spike in trading volumes, from $46,000 per day to over $566,000 at the price peak, to over $1.1 million at writing time on Friday. These tokens are traded at the crypto exchange Gate and on the decentralized exchange PlasmaSwap.  Base token’s own model is rather novel: Its creators say BASE represents the entire crypto industry, with its price pegged to the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies at a ratio of 1:1 trillion.  “BASE allows traders to speculate on the entire crypto industry with one token,” the token’s site says.

42412772,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6HWq,1677202868,"First Mover Asia: Resilient Bitcoin Rebounds Above $24K Despite Investors' Inflation, Labor Market Concerns","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin tossed and turned above and below $24K before settling over the threshold.  Insights: Bitcoin funding rates have been positive for 10 consecutive days. Why should investors care?  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,118 −2.1 ▼ 0.2% Bitcoin (BTC) $24,052 −101.1 ▼ 0.4% Ethereum (ETH) $1,659 +17.7 ▲ 1.1% S&P 500  4,012.32 +21.3 ▲ 0.5% Gold  $1,832 +0.2 ▲ 0.0% Nikkei 225  27,104.32 −368.8 ▼ 1.3% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Bitcoin Shows Its Mettle in Rebounding Above $24K  Bitcoin spent Thursday in a fretfully, uncertain mood, teeter-tottering below and above $24,000 as investors continued to evaluate the U.S. Federal Reserve's ongoing dialogue about monetary policy and jobs data suggesting that inflation would remain problematic.  The largest cryptocurrency was recently trading at $24,052, down 0.4% over the past 24 hours but well off its earlier week high over $25,000. Still, analysts remain cautiously optimistic about BTC's prospects after watching it surge about 40% since the start of the year amid an improved, overall economic backdrop.  ""People feel that the worst may be over in terms of bad news that we had in the crypto sector last year, and that's why it's [bitcoin] more resilient,"" Bradley Duke, co-CEO of institutional-grade digital asset-back securities provider ETC Group, told CoinDesk's ""First Mover"" program.  In a separate CoinDesk TV interview, Julius de Kempenaer, senior technical analyst at research platform Stockcharts.com, said he was encouraged by bitcoin's ability to hold support first at $18,000 and than at higher levels in recent months, including its recent perch around $24,000. ""As long as we remain around that level, where we now are – we can put in a low here and break through 25K – that is a signal to go up to that 30K area,"" de Kempenaer said.  Ether was recently changing hands at $1,659, up about 1.1%. Other major cryptos were flat, albeit tinted slightly red with AVAX, the token of base-layer network Avalanche Network, and MATIC, the token of layer 2 platform Polygon, dropping about 3% and 2.5%, respectively. OPT, the native crypto of layer 2 scaling tool Optimism, was up more than 6% hours after crypto exchange Coinbase said it was building its layer 2 blockchain using the OP Stack in collaboration with the protocol.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a measure of the digital asset market's performance, was down 0.2%.  Stocks rose with the S&P 500, which has a technology heavy component gaining 0.5% to break a four-day losing streak and the tech-focused Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rising a few fractions of a percentage point. The Nasdaq took heart from semi conductor manufacturer Nvidia, which on Wednesday said it expected business to improve amid the euphoria about the ChatGPT artificial intelligence chat tool. AI tokens have been surging since the public unveiling of chatbot ChatGPT and image generation software Dall-E in mid-2022.  Meanwhile, the U.S. Labor Department reported that initial jobless claims for the week ending Feb. 18 fell by 3,000 to 192,000 but were below the consensus estimate of 200,000. Strong jobs data has been thorny for the U.S. Federal Reserve as it tries to reduce inflation from 6.4% to a target rate of 2%. The ongoing angst about high prices has made risk-on investors hesitant.  On an eventful day, crypto news was mixed. As CoinDesk reported, venture capital powerhouses a16z led a $25 million Series A investment in Here Not There to build out Towns, a Web3 group chat protocol and app that lets online communities build blockchain-based gatherings in a fully decentralized way, and Pantera invested $10 million in Worldwide Webb, creator of a pixel art-based metaverse game. But Federal law enforcement authorities added to charges against Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced, former CEO of crypto exchange FTX, and NFT platform Dapper Labs said that it was laying off 20% of its employees less than four months after a 22% workforce cut.  Stockcharts.com's De Kempenaer noted that the ""risk appetite of the investor is increasing again.""  ""Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general could benefit on the back of that,"" he said. ""And if you just look at what's happening in the crypto market, you see buyers coming in. They're willing to pay higher prices, sellers are holding on longer – they only want to sell at higher prices.""

Funding rates represent payments between holders of perpetual futures contracts. When the rate is positive, holders of long positions pay holders of short positions in order to remain on that side of the trade.  When funding rates are negative, the opposite is the case, where shorts pay longs. In bitcoin’s case, funding rates have been positive every day since Jan. 14, with the exception of a neutral reading on Feb. 12. Investors holding long positions expect an asset’s value to increase, while those who are short an asset expect its value to decline.  Persistently positive funding rates indicate that BTC traders currently view the asset favorably, and are willing to pay a fee to express their bullishness.

The sale will feature a series of physical and digital collectibles linked to elements from the book, including a hand-forged sword created by New Zealand-based designer Wētā Workshop inspired by the one used by the book’s protagonist.  There will also be a sale of a generative art collection titled Infocalypse by artist Tony Sheeder featuring works inspired by “Dioxin Posse,” the graphic novel that preceded ""Snow Crash."" The digital art collection will be sold on Sotheby’s Metaverse non-fungible token (NFT) platform, “a full-circle moment for the man who coined the term,” Sotheby's said in a press release.  The collection celebrates 30 years since the novel was published and its impact on Web3. The book’s exploration into the human experience in the digital world has played a significant role in defining what the metaverse might look like in years to come.  “Half of my life ago, with my head full of computer graphics lore and visions of a satirical cyberpunk future, I sat down to write 'Snow Crash,'” Stephenson said in the press release. “Covered with hand-written edits and typesetting notes that have since been rendered obsolete by digital codes, it bridges the era during which video games and the Internet became ubiquitous in our lives.”  Cassandra Hatton, Sotheby’s global head of science and popular culture, said in a press release that she’s enthusiastic about bringing the lore from the novel to fans at a time when its cultural relevance has been revitalized.  “'Snow Crash' is a cult classic, known by fans all over the world for its prescient look at the future of technology,” said Hatton. “Now considered a true totem of our modern age, Stephenson not only predicted technologies which we consider mainstream today, but his ideas have since gone on to inspire generations of inventors and entrepreneurs who shape the very fabric of our digital development.”  The ""Snow Crash"" manuscript is estimated to be worth between $40,000 and $60,000. Bidding opens on Feb. 27.  In the years since Stephenson published his novel he has been busy developing the foundations for his own metaverse concept. In June, he teamed up with crypto pioneer Peter Vessenes to begin building Lamina1, a metaverse-focused blockchain. In December, the company created an ecosystem fund to distribute grants to Web3 developers.

42412757,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6HHs,1677197482,"Coinbase's New Layer 2 Blockchain, Base, Has Rocky Rollout","The debut of Coinbase's new layer 2 blockchain, Base, proved anything but smooth as Thursday’s testnet rollout racked up user complaints and jabs on Twitter.  The new Ethereum-focused protocol forms an integral part of Coinbase's strategy to steer its business into the developer space – especially critical after a slowdown in its exchange traffic and disappointing quarterly earnings reports.  But just hours after Base's debut the network was already experiencing problems, and users flooded social media to complain about the network's functionality.  ""Base's bridge is off to a rough start. Every single transaction reverting and the bridge contract is unverified so nobody can figure out what's going on,"" Twitter user @0xfoobar wrote alongside a screenshot of a transaction list from Etherscan, in which transactions appear to have been reverted.  The testnet's operational glitches were caused by an issue with Coinbase's wallets, which incorrectly estimated the amount of gas, or fees, required to execute users' transactions, according to Coinbase.  As a result, users paid less gas than needed to execute their transactions, which prompted Base to revert those transactions instead of processing them.  ""The bridge contracts bump up gas usage under load, which wallets weren't properly estimating,"" Coinbase software engineer Roberto Bayardo explained on Twitter some hours after the launch. ""Hardcoded a higher gas limit.""  A sudden rush of users may have overwhelmed the protocol and also been to blame for issues during the testnet's launch day, according to Bayardo.  ""There are still some other limits that could still get hit – people (& bots?) are bridging like mad it seems,"" Bayardo tweeted.  Adjusting on the fly  Additional scrutiny came after the Base team softened a pledge on its website to donate 20% of sequencer revenue to “funding public goods.” Screenshots of the page were posted by Twitter user @tier10k.  Hours after the timestamp on the screenshots, the website was updated to state that Base will contribute an undisclosed percentage, or a ""portion of sequencer revenue,"" to public goods.  A Coinbase representative said the 20% figure was removed from Base's website as it works with the Optimism Collective to finalize the amount of revenue that will be allocated to public goods.  ""Initially, we included a percentage to that revenue amount, but we are in the process of finalizing that percentage, and therefore have removed the specific number from our website until it is established,"" the representative said.
