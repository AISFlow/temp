42426410,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJNA5h,1434392460,MovieTickets.com Brings Bitcoin to Over 900 US Movie Theaters,"MovieTickets.com, one of the largest movie ticket purchasing platforms in the US, now enables movie-goers to buy movie tickets with bitcoin at 985 theaters.  The move was made possible through an integration with bitcoin payment processor GoCoin. As a result, theater chains that use the credit card processing services offered by MovieTickets.com will be able to accept bitcoin for any film offered.  GoCoin CEO Steve Beauregard indicated that this includes Regal Cinemas, the nation's largest theater chain with more than 500 locations. Holdouts notably include AMC Theaters, which itself boasts more than 300 locations in North America.  The partnership is the latest betwen GoCoin and a movie industry firm, following the May announcement that it was in talks with production studio Lionsgate Films.  Beauregard told CoinDesk:  ""We think that the future of digital content is being able to use digital currencies to purchase content.""  The promotion was inspired by the promotional strategy for Dope, the hit indie film that scored big at Sundance and earned high-profile celebrity fans from James Franco to Russell Simmons.  MovieTickets.com CEO Joel Cohen suggested that, however, the company saw the potential in enabling the technology in more of its offerings.  ""Our intention is to keep the option available beyond the film’s theatrical run for other films to benefit from. The more payment options we offer, the broader our customer base becomes,"" he told CoinDesk.  'Dope' promotion  Hailed for its progressive take on youth black culture, Dope centers on the exploits of modern high school students inspired by 1990s-era hip-hop. Notably, bitcoin plays a role in the film itself, as its protagonists use the digital currency to profit from the illicit sale of ecstasy online.  As for the decision to include bitcoin as part of the marketing for the film, this was accomplished through a partnership between US distributor Open Road Films, MovieTickets.com and GoCoin.  In statements, Cohen aimed to describe the company as open to innovative and unique partnerships that drive attention to moviemakers.  ""It’s cool, it’s original and we’re going above and beyond the common boundaries to drive ticket sales,"" Cohen said.  Dope is scheduled to be released in the US on 19th June.

42426392,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN9Xh,1434388594,Bitcoin Exchange MonetaGo Launches in 40 Countries,"MonetaGo, a new exchange with ambitions to take bitcoin ""global"", launched across 40 countries today.  First announced in April, the platform offers bitcoin buying and selling in 28 local currencies. As a twist, MonetaGo users can also 'fix' or 'peg' their bitcoin to these various exchange rates.  Speaking to CoinDesk, serial entrepreneur Jesse Chenard, MonetaGo's CEO, said:  ""Digital currency is supposed to be this global phenomenon that is going to enable the seamless transmission of funds across borders, but the reality of it is that 90-something percent of all bitcoin trading happens in three currencies only.""  In extending services to underserved markets outside the dollar, yuan and euro, Chenard and his co-founders hope to make bitcoin more accessible and cost effective for new users.  On the surface, MonetaGo's interface is little different to other exchanges out there. However, under the bonnet the platform – built using Alphapoint technology – has access to 35 order books from a network of regional partner exchanges, via their API.  Chenard said the platform aims to reach 50 partners by the end of 2015.  Fixed value  Much like Bitreserve, MonetaGo offers users the ability to 'fix' their bitcoin value to any of its 27 regional currencies. However, whereas the former does not offer the option to cash out 'Bitdollars' into real dollars (only bitcoin), MonetaGo does.  The ability to send this fixed-value bitcoin to other users, who can then convert it into other currencies, could be beneficial to businesses, not just consumers, Chenard said.  Besides shielding both parties from bitcoin's volatility, the process could speed up payments for companies who lack a fast and reliable corresponding banking network between them.  ""You have a balance of $12 and you wind up having to spend another $45 to get them their $18.""  Chenard says he is ""still rationalising"" how people will use this 'send' functionality. For now, the focus is on getting MonetaGo's banking relationships watertight, to ensure fiat on- and off-ramps are smooth.  In terms of fees, the platform will be free of charge for the first few weeks, later charging between 0.1% and 0.5% per trade, dependent on each user's monthly volume.  ""If you're converting twice [by using the 'send' function] we're looking at ways to halve that fee as we're double charging at that point,"" the CEO said.  Compliance  MonetaGo is privately funded by a handful of investors, including Chenard, who says the exchange is likely to raise a round ""fairly shortly"".  Alongside Chenard, whose company Tremor Video went public in 2013, MonetaGo's founding team includes Chenard's ""serial co-founder"" CMO Tad Davis, ex-Alphapoint CEO Margaux Avedisian and Igot's Patrick Manasse.  Since its beginnings in October 2014, MonetaGo's team has been laser-focused on compliance. The New York company is in the process of completing the paperwork for its BitLicense, but has spent the last six months in talks with regulators and banks across the globe.  From these conversations, Chenard described a ""shaking out phase"" for bitcoin. Though some states, like New York, have made demands, others remain tight-lipped on the subject of bitcoin. This may soon change:  ""I feel this year there is going to be a lot of clarity brought to how we are supposed to operate and what standards we are supposed to meet.""

42426428,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJN9lh,1434377456,Swiss Crypto Community Reacts to Bitcoin's VAT Exemption,"Switzerland's bitcoin community has spoken out following confirmation that bitcoin is exempt from Value Added Tax (VAT) in the country.  Bitcoin had always been exempt from VAT in the country, Luzius Meisser, president at Bitcoin Association Switzerland, told CoinDesk, adding that the Swiss Federal Tax Administration (FTA) had clarified the situation following a formal question submitted by his group in February last year.  When asked about the implications for bitcoin business in Switzerland, Meisser said:  ""This has direct implications for all bitcoin companies with Swiss customers. They now know for sure that they do not need to charge VAT. However, it does not affect transactions of Swiss companies with foreign customers. In that case, VAT might still apply as the service is exported.""  Erik Voorhees, founder at Switzerland-based cryptocurrency company ShapeShift, also welcomed the news and praised the country's ""measured and reasonable stance on bitcoin"".  He said: ""This is helpful to our business as prices can be more competitive – ultimately the avoidance of any tax is good for individuals and business and makes the market more productive as less capital is extracted from it.""  The digital currency's exemption from VAT was also praised by people outside the bitcoin space. Jean-Christophe Schwaab, a Swiss Socialist politician told CoinDesk:  ""I think that exempting bitcoin is a good decision that could help the rising of bitcoin in my country. To pay VAT on a payment method is quite absurd!""  Bitcoin taxation in Europe  The clarification for Swiss bitcoin companies follows their Spanish counterparts' celebration in April, after the Ministerio de Hacienda – the Tax Office – clarified that bitcoin was exempt from VAT following a question submitted by a digital currency enthusiast.  Meanwhile, an oral hearing to discuss bitcoin's VAT exemption is due to take place at the European Courts of Justice in Luxembourg on Wednesday. The session has been organised to address Sweden's question of whether bitcoin exchanges would be liable to pay tax on the fees that are charged to their users.  The Swedish case is known as C-264/14 Skatteverket v David Hedqvist.
