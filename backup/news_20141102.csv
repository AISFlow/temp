42426146,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjHth,1414962024,Mexican Bitcoin Exchange MeXBT Eyes Latin American Trade and Remittances,"Mexican cryptocurrency exchange meXBT announced the official launch of its professional trading platform in Las Vegas this Sunday at Money 20/20, one of the largest and most prominent conferences for payments and financial services innovation worldwide.  The company showcased its service in combination with AlphaPoint, the exchange technology solutions provider that powers the platform and user experience, allowing meXBT to focus on its broader and longer-term ambitions to expand within its home market of Mexico and Latin America. AlphaPoint provides the infrastructure for the exchange back-end, removing the need to hire developers.  COO and cofounder Joel Cano called Money 20/20 an ideal setting in which to debut meXBT as it extends beyond bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to banking and FinTech.  “In order for us to be successful in this market in Latin America we have to think outside of the bitcoin community,” he said. “We have to think as a solution for people that might have searched for banking solutions but haven’t found what works for them.”  MeXBT differentiates itself from other startups in Mexico and the bitcoin ecosystem in that it is more concentrated on developing partnerships and relationships with regional banks and payment processors, among other efforts for market penetration, than it is on refining the immediate solution – the trading platform – which it leaves to AlphaPoint.  Focusing on usability  CEO and founder Gabriel Miron told CoinDesk that the team spent six months talking to white-label exchange companies and even started working with a few, but didn’t manage to see a product through until it met with AlphaPoint. Now, he said, he believes meXBT “has the best technology in Latin America”.  Users are required to verify their accounts before they can be active on meXBT, but when they have, they can deposit Mexican, Colombian and Chilean pesos, US dollars, Brazilian reals and Peruvian nuevo sols through cash deposit, wire transfer or payment processor, depending on the currency. They can only cash out in dollars or Mexican pesos.  “When we started this we decided that our main focus was going to … make it simple enough that new users can come into cryptocurrencies,” said Miron. “Being in Latin America, that was kind of a challenge, so we really try and focus on usability.”  Once logged in, users are able to withdraw, deposit, buy or sell using the options menu at the top of the page. Traders can buy bitcoin or litecoin at market price, or place limit orders if they prefer.  The platform has also integrated Coinapult’s LOCKS tool to tie the value of cryptocurrency to another asset, thereby protecting its underlying value from price volatility.  Market opportunities  Miron said that meXBT, while interested in speculation and the ability to move money quickly, its real focus is on its own business in its home market – specifically, remittances for consumers and international commerce for businesses.  AlphaPoint CEO Vadim Telyatnikov said that remittances could be bitcoin's best value proposition and that he's excited to see how meXBT can bring such services to the Latin American region:  “Remittance could be that early killer app and meXBT is perfectly positioned to enable remittances to and from Latin America through their local relationships.”  Cano added that the company’s banking partnerships are critical to the success of bitcoin and of meXBT in Mexico and Latin America, saying:  “I think we are using the leverage of a great technology company and doing what we do best in local markets, which is expanding the market and making sure the customer has a great user experience.”  Mexico leads in both remittances and international trade, Cano pointed out. Remittance flows to Latin America totalled almost $54bn last year. In 2012, Mexico alone accounted for about $23bn. Latin America also exported $1.12tn last year, he said citing World Bank numbers, of which $380bn came from Mexico.

42426148,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjHhh,1414943123,London Startup Seeks to Unleash DIY Bitcoin Trading Bots on the Markets,"Bitcoin trading bots will no longer be the exclusive preserve of software and finance wonks if startup Tradewave has its way.  The London-based company has developed a platform that lets users create their own trading bots, stripping away some of the complexities of programming such tools independently.  Tradewave  's founder James Potter said his platform would address the ""mismatch"" between institutional traders with the resources to develop their own bots and retail investors who are left to execute trades by hand:  ""A lot of institutional trading is now automated and retail is very manual ... There's a wave of companies now that are democratising automated trading.""  Trades placed by software have seen explosive growth in the established financial markets. High-frequency trading, which is conducted by algorithms, accounts for up to three-quarters of trading volume in US stock markets, according to the Bank of England. This has grown from less than 20% of trading volume in 2005.  Democratising bot trading  Tradewave lets users write trading strategies in Python, a programming language. The Python scripts are run off Tradewave's website, which means users don't have to set up a programming 'environment' to operate their bots, which can be a cumbersome process.  Users can payhttps://tradewave.net/pricing/ $19.99 a month to connect their Tradewave bots to four exchanges: Bitstamp, BTC-e, Bitfinex and Kraken. The Tradewave bots can then buy and sell on those exchanges on the user's accounts.  Potter said he has raised seed funding for Tradewave from a prominent angel investor in the cryptocurrency space, who he declined to identify for the record.  Tradewave began as a side-project for Potter, who has worked as a software engineer for startups in Silicon Valley. Initial postings about the platform on Reddit, Bitcoin Talk and Twitter last December garnered about 1,000 users, he said. He declined to say how many users he currently has on the platform.  Although Tradewave users currently have to write their trading strategies in Python, Potter said he is working on simplifying that process. His platform will let users create strategies in simple English, keeping the programming language hidden. He plans to release this feature in two to three weeks, he said.  ""People are really fascinated by automated trading,"" he continued. ""But once they sign up, they find they can't code in Python. So, over the last two to three months, I've been working on a new way of building a trading strategy in English ... We just translate it into Python, but the user never sees it.""  Algorithmic trading trends  Even if users write strategies in English instead of Python, is there a market for DIY bitcoin trading bots? Potter, for one, believes a niche exists. By his estimates, about 50,000 individuals trade actively on the cryptocurrency markets, and he's betting that some of them will pay for a sophisticated tool like Tradewave.  Trading bot software has proliferated in the cryptocurrency markets. Off-the-shelf bot subscriptions, like at Butter Bot, can be purchased for about $140 a year. Opensource bots, like RBTC Arbitrage, can be installed for free. In the wider financial markets, a startup called Quantopia has raised millions to build a platform that allows individuals to create their own automated trading methods.  A new bitcoin-based derivatives platform, First Global Credit, said it's developing an API to allow automated trading because of demand from its clients.  Cofounder Marcie Terman said:  ""We have traditional funds who are putting together high net-worth money that they will trade ... We also have some private traders who asked for automated trading.""  A former bot trader, Joseph Lee, wrote his own software to execute trades, claiming to have made $200,000 in profits. Today, Lee doesn't run his bots; instead he operates derivatives platform BTC.sx. He said he is also seeing demand from his customers for automated trading.  Lee added that services like Tradewave are useful for introducing algorithmic trading to the cryptomarkets because they remove some of the tedious but complex tasks – like back-testing trading strategies – involved in creating a bot.  ""The tricky part, back-testing the algorithm, requires large datasets and a lot of number crunching. This requires development skills ... easy if you know how, difficult if you don't,"" he said.

42426152,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjI1h,1414926320,6 Types of Businesses Bitcoin Will Enable for the First Time,"Bitcoin is not just a new form of payment, and it isn’t simply a store of value. It is, perhaps most importantly, a public ledger, and it is the part of bitcoin known as the block chain that many argue holds the true innovative potential of the technology.  In essence, bitcoin is a new foundational technology built using the Internet, utilizing both the power of cryptography, as well as aspects of older, less disruptive forms of virtual currency.  Because bitcoin provides a totally new infrastructure, this means there will be a number of businesses built both surrounding it and on top of it. Those built surrounding it, you may be more familiar with today, as companies like wallet providers and processors will store bitcoin and allow you to use it as payment.  However, there is another part of the industry, one that is only in its earliest stages, that seeks to build new projects using the block chain, thereby allowing entrepreneurs to pursue ideas that did not exist at all just five years ago.  Here are six examples of new business models that block chain technology could enable.  1. Record-keeping  Bitcoin’s public ledger has the ability to enable trusted record-keeping on the Internet while increasing overall transparency. There hasn’t been a really good way to offer a public database of information prior to this type of cryptographic ledger.  Some interesting projects have already appeared that seek to record public information with block chain technologies. One example is Monegraph, spearheaded by a New York University (NYU) professor to record digital art ownership on the namecoin block chain.  Business cases for an Internet-enabled public record are already percolating as well.  The startup CrowdCurity has used the block chain to help find vulnerabilities in websites. Further, developers looking for easy programmatic access to bitcoin’s ledger can use Hello! Block, a startup offering public ledger data-as-a-service via HTTP.  The block chain could be used in the future to help businesses automate record-keeping and facilitate general business transactions, not only those conducted in bitcoin.  2. Asset distribution  Bitcoin’s market capitalization is above $5bn right now. And while that may be a far cry from its peak, the strong value of its network, in turn, gives credence to the value of bitcoin as a new type of asset class.  This means simply that people are beginning to see cryptocurrencies as an asset that can be used to back the value of anything that has worth.  Overstock is working on a new type of stock exchange that uses cryptography called Medici. The retailer has hired the developers behind Counterparty, a crypto 2.0 protocol built on top of bitcoin, to accomplish this. Another is Hyperledger, which is using something called consensus algorithms to back assets. This allows Hyperledger users to quickly create assets without the need for a secure network like bitcoin, which has taken years to grow its vast computational power.  These projects may soon face their own regulatory issues, as evidenced by recent rumors about the potential for such assets to be viewed as securities, but there are some interesting technical ideas that seek to make cryptographic asset distribution a viable business.  Cryptographic asset distribution may allow companies to raise money in a secure and effective manner without relying on bankers who charge massive fees.  3. Wallet technologies  Wallets that allow users to store bitcoin have been around since the very first software client for the cryptocurrency was created. However, that doesn't mean this sector is without innovation, as more advanced wallet technologies are now being built by companies in the space.  Probably the most important tech emerging for wallets today is multi-signature. It is a type of private-key security that protects wallet balances by using several keys to unlock funds – hence the name 'multi-signature'.  BitGo  is a company focused on wallet technologies and is building advanced multisig technology that can be used in large organizations.  Similarly, companies like Hive continue to push the envelop with what a wallet can do, offering things like third-party apps, BIPS32 hierarchical deterministic (HD) security and a HTML5 web wallet that is the exact same product across all user devices.  Wallet technologies in the future will allow more flexibility in the way money is handled; creating new financial tools and escrow products that can execute themselves in a trustless manner.  4. Smart contracts  The concept of smart contracts was first conceived by researcher Nick Szabo in the 1990s. The idea is to implement programmable, self-executing agreements without the need for a third party.  The true application of smart contacts hasn’t been fully realized yet, but bitcoin’s emergence is generating momentum for this type of digital agreement between parties.  One company, Hedgy, is working to build smart contracts in the bitcoin block chain in order to enforce contractual price agreements. Hedgy’s goal with smart contracts like this is to reduce the risk of bitcoin price volatility.  Ripple Labs is using fault isolation technology developed for the web by Google for its smart contracts project, called Codius. Another effort, called BitHalo, uses multisig technology to create peer-to-peer smart contracts that users can easily transact with one another.  Smart contracts have the potential to replace archaic paper contracts in the future, and offer dynamic agreements that tie into technology systems. For example, a smart contract could be programmed to launch a specific subset of code at a certain date and time.  5. Mining  Bitcoin mining, the process by which computers confirm transactions on the network, is likewise turning into big business, and as mining grows more powerful, advanced tools are required to manage these systems.  Mergers and consolidation  are occurring in the mining sector as companies try to reduce overall costs associated with mining infrastructure.  PeerNova  is a good example of these consolidation efforts underway. The company is the result of a merger between mining hardware developer HighBitcoin and mining-as-a-service company Cloudhashing. Combined, they are now working on advanced mining solutions.  A lot of companies not previously involved in mining have seen its opportunity as well – especially exchanges. BTC China, currently the world’s largest bitcoin exchange by volume, recently opened its own mining pool to customers. Cryptsy, a exchange for many cryptocurrencies, is working on a platform for trading mining contracts.  One of the most interesting things that future mining applications could provide is computational power for solving tough problems by leveraging proof of work to look for solutions to issues like protein folding.  6. Bitcoin support  These five rapidly developing brand-new business models have sprouted up from the still-nascent cryptocurrency economy. The businesses depend on the smart entrepreneurs who see untapped potential in such an all-encompassing technical innovation.  There are also some ventures that smartly take existing concepts and use the cryptocurrency model.  Microtransaction providers  , bitcoin recruiting services and charities that only accept cryptocurrencies are all playing a part in promoting and expanding the community. They aren’t brand-new business models like the ones listed above, but they are supporting the industry with necessary products and services  Every day, more business ideas are formed around cryptocurrencies. The more there are, the stronger the community becomes to help drive the industry forward. It's easy to imagine there will be plenty more support businesses that will develop around bitcoin, just like in any other industry.  The question is: What other great business ideas will be formulated in near future as this emerging technology continues its progress?
