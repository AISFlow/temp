19525169,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558036,1698530440,"XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Points Out Incoming Mega Bounce, Here’s The Target","Another bullish prediction has come in for the XRP price which is arguably more optimistic than many would expect. This time around, a crypto analyst is expecting XRP to use up its stored energy for an explosive rally that could see the altcoin rally to $27, well above its all-time high. XRP Price Suppressed During Last Bull Run Because Of SEC Lawsuit Crypto analyst ERGAG CRYPTO recently predicted that XRP is poised for a massive 4,000% price surge. ERGAG made this prediction in an X post, detailing how this price surge can be actually possible. According to the analyst, XRP’s price was suppressed during the last major crypto bull run in 2021 due to an ongoing lawsuit from the SEC against Ripple Labs, XRP’s creator. Related Reading: Litecoin Whales Are Back In The Game, Can Price Reach $100? While Bitcoin and other altcoins were hitting new all-time highs, the XRP price struggled to keep up due to fears the lawsuit could severely impact the project’s future. For instance, during this time period, Bitcoin skyrocketed by 23X, and Ethereum also went up a whopping 58X. A federal judge in the United States has since determined that the programmatic sales of XRP do not constitute the selling of securities. Now that the lawsuit seems to be coming to an end with a settlement in sight, XRP is poised to make up for lost time and shoot up with this lost energy. The analyst predicts the XRP price could rally 40 times from its current level to $27 in the subsequent bull run, which would exactly coincide with the Fibonacci 1.618 indicator from the 2017 peak to the 2020 bottom. Source: X Although a timeline for the next bull run is not known at the moment, ERGAG puts this spike to happen around mid-2024. One day for sure. But suggestion March – May 2024 will be fire works. — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 26, 2023 What’s Next For XRP? The entire crypto market has witnessed gains since the middle of October, and the XRP price hasn’t been left out. Bitcoin, for instance, attained a new yearly high of $35,150. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.547, up by 5.73% in the past seven days. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Team Member Clarifies SHIB Burn As Shibarium Grows Although its price is relatively low compared to other altcoins, XRP is still one of the strongest in the entire market, occupying the 5th spot in terms of market cap. ERGAG CRYPTO has also had some very optimistic price predictions for XRP in the past. While a $27 price point seems very overachieving, XRP could easily smash through its previous all-time high of $3.84 in the next bull market. The analyst had initially predicted that the altcoin might not see a new all-time high by July 2028.

However, on-chain data has shown that accumulation has been going on for a while, with SHIB whales now accumulating $300 million in the past three months. Shiba Inu Whales Have Been Accumulating Large Amounts Of SHIB On-chain data from IntoTheBlock has shown that SHIB whales, meaning large holders, have been accumulating huge amounts of SHIB over the last few months. Large holders in the Shiba Inu ecosystem are divided into 12 whales (those with more than 1% of circulating supply) and 47 investors (those with more than 0.1% of circulating supply). These top SHIB wallet addresses have added an increase of +33.17%, around $300 million worth of SHIB in just the last 90 days. Related Reading: Litecoin Whales Are Back In The Game, Can Price Reach $100? Data from the on-chain tracker Whale Alerts has shown various massive transfers during this time period. When investors accumulate large amounts, it often signals an incoming price rally. 🚨 🚨 4,544,030,677,374 #SHIB (32,142,200 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallethttps://t.co/Y7jvL2qtJV — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) October 21, 2023 These massive accumulations by large holders point to their bullish belief in SHIB, despite the crypto having a weak momentum before the ongoing spike in the crypto market. This accumulation can, for the most part, be traced back to the introduction of Shibarium. The layer-2 solution developed by Shiba Inu, known as Shibarium, has had a good deal of success. At the time this article was written, the Shibarium blockchain had a total of 3,685,073 transactions and 1,257,858 wallet addresses. SHIB Future Outlook SHIB has had a price spike in relation to the ongoing inflow of funds into the crypto market currently being spearheaded by Bitcoin. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00000784 after facing rejection at the $0.0000082 mark. Bulls have defended the $0.0000061 support level and $0.0000077 levels very strongly to form support after the price tested the latter level multiple times. A sustained move above $0.0000082 could send SHIB skyrocketing to its August high of $0.00001137. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Rally: Analyst Sets $45,000 Target And It’s Closer Than You Think Large SHIB holders now hold 71% of the total circulating supply, and some of them can manipulate the price to their advantage. While whale accumulation is a positive sign, there are other things to consider regarding SHIB’s price outlook. On the other hand, the Shiba Inu developers and team leaders have pointed at upcoming projects in the ecosystem, one of which is a stablecoin based on Shibarium. If successful, a SHIB-based stablecoin could attract new investors to the Shiba Inu ecosystem, leading to a strong SHIB price spike.

19508901,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=558019,1698501600,"Solana Price Could Reach $3,211 By 2030, VanEck Forecasts","SOL, the native token of the Solana blockchain, has been one of the biggest winners in the crypto market lately, delivering another positive price performance over the past week. This impressive price action reflects the increased interest in the altcoin and the recent shift in the climate of the general crypto market. Interestingly, asset management firm VanEck is amongst the latest entities showing interest in the Solana token and the altcoin’s prospects. VanEck Predicts Potential 10,000% Rally For Solana In a report published on Friday, October 27, prominent asset management company VanEck created different valuation scenarios for the SOL token. This price projection revolved around the current capability and potential of the Solana blockchain. In a base case, VanEck believes that Solana can hold a 30% share in the smart contract market, a significant increase from the network’s current market share. Using this valuation framework, the asset manager projects SOL price to reach $335 by 2030. Related Reading: Aptos TVL Soars To A Record $74 Million, Reflecting Growing Investor Confidence Comparatively, Ethereum can achieve a 70% market share of value transmitted across open-source blockchains, according to the report. This projection makes $11,800 a possible destination for ETH’s price by 2030. Nevertheless, VanEck presented a bull case for SOL in its analysis, putting forward a $3,211 price target for the altcoin in the best possible scenario. The asset management firm said: Were Solana to avoid Ethereum’s event horizon and achieve Ethereum-like dominance, our bull case reveals $51.8B in revenues and a $3,211 price target in 2030. It would take the Solana token a massive 10,000% price rally to reach $3,211 from the current price point. Now, it is worth mentioning that there was also a pessimistic scenario for SOL in the VanEck report, with the token projected to trade below $10 in a bearish case. VanEck, one of the world’s largest asset management firms, has been an active participant in the cryptocurrency space over the past few years. The financial behemoth is one of the few companies looking to launch a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund in the United States. SOL Price Overview As earlier inferred, Solana has been on an upward trajectory over the past few weeks. Since initial concerns of a significant sell-off by FTX have subsided and the general market sentiment has improved, the altcoin’s price performance has been positive. Related Reading: FTX Ramps Up Restitution Efforts, Subpoenas AI Firm CAIS Over $6.5M Investment As of this writing, the SOL token is valued at $32.19, reflecting a 2% in the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin broke its previous 2023 high and gained nearly 10% in a breakout, raising questions about a move to $100K. There are bullish paths towards $100K+, including a direct impulse or an ABC structure, with confirmation needed for the latter. Produced by Ryan Wilday with Avi Gilburt and Jason Appel Against a background of economic uncertainty, a hawkish Fed, and soft markets in bonds and equities, it seems to me that most pundits and macros-oriented analysts have been bearish on crypto. As a prolific consumer of crypto podcasts, I marveled at the number of hosts that recently called the crypto market a bear market. At least, up until last week. How many would say that equities were in a bear market if they spent most of their time 30-100% above the prior year's close? Yet that is where Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has spent the latter half of 2023 to date. I guess crypto investors are too much accustomed to returns in multiples of three to ten. My colleague Jason Appel posted an article in August that noted the potential of a major breakout in Bitcoin. Though Bitcoin took three months to work up to that breakout. But finally, this past Monday, October 23, Bitcoin broke the reins of its previous 2023 high at $31,800. It tacked on nearly 10% that day in a major breakout. Is this the beginning of our long-expected move to $100K? Or are Bitcoin traders and investors destined for a return to the low, range-bound action we have seen over the last few months? Or, worse, will this breakout turn into a fakeout and a return to the bear market? Before we jump in, I give you my usual warning. In my view, the Elliott Wave theory, my primary analysis tool, is best used as a means of establishing risk versus reward. As a full-time trader, I accept a certain amount of very controlled losses. To that effect, if a key level I consider to be critical is breached, my view of the market changes. I am then likely to adjust my position or plan. A Bearish Mention Let's get the 'bear-talk' out of the way first. Every trader of breakouts knows that some breakouts fail. I see the chances of this one failing as slim. But regardless of how price structure forms from here, if Bitcoin breaches $26,530 it should return to its six-month consolidation. Further, it could easily slip through the bottom of the range at $25K. If it were to do so, that would not mean that Bitcoin was back in its 2022 bear market. But it would open the door to challenging $18,900, which, if breached, would bring the bear back. On top of $26,530, I want to see Bitcoin fill in five waves before it breaks $42K, and hold $30,600 if it starts its fourth wave from its current price of $34,500. Breaking $30,600 would be an early warning that price will collapse, until the five waves in circle-1 are completed. For those inclined to trade more tightly, this is a level you can watch. I lean bullish. But I am faithful to tell you where the bears will take hold, so you can measure your risk. The Bullish Paths Let's assume that the bears have given up the ghost and Bitcoin is free to run. Again, this is my leaning. I am watching two paths towards $100K+. The first is a direct impulse toward $100K and ideally stretches to $125K. But first, as mentioned above, Bitcoin should form five waves under $42K. After that it should pull back to the mid to low $27Ks before it gives us a more decisive breakout from the higher low at circle-2. That should start a very rapid ascent in wave-iii to $80K+ before the final major consolidation in wave iv. That wave iv may take four months, just as wave ii did before the final push to $100K. Bitcoin, 2HR chart (MotiveWave software) Bitcoin, 1D chart (MotiveWave software) The second path I am watching is an ABC structure, shown in red on my chart. This is based on my view that the five-wave structure that started off the 2018 low, and is working on its final move higher, is an ending diagonal. This is a debatable view. But I will have confirmation of this potential if Bitcoin breaks over $42K without finishing five waves. That would make it likely that we see an A-wave top in the $50K region. In that event, as long as Bitcoin holds the $19K region, it should make a final push as a C-wave to $100-125K. What About the Coming Halving? I don't watch the halving cycles to help with my decision-making. (Halvings are when the Bitcoin rewards to miners are cut in half, as determined by Bitcoin's code, roughly every four years. These cycles have corresponded to significant price rises for Bitcoin.) I develop my trading strategies off hundreds of data points. We've had only three halving cycles. But it does seem that this scenario lines up well with the next halving event, which will be in mid-2024. In Conclusion To wrap this up, we've been looking for six-figure Bitcoin prices for a long time. While Bitcoin has not made haste to fulfill our expectation, it has not invalidated this view. 2023 has given us a slow-moving bull market, with much time spent tracking sideways. It has been so slow that many voices in the crypto space have called it a bear market. If the Bitcoin breakout on October 23 sustains, that discussion should be put to rest as Bitcoin continues higher into the end of the year, and perhaps to $100K in 2024.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4644424-bitcoin-has-started-its-push-upwards?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/19504918.jpeg

Even amidst whale movements, which suggest that investors are taking profit, LINK has managed to maintain its bullish momentum, gaining by 6.10% in the last day to above the $11 mark. However, despite the positive sentiment that has currently overwhelmed the LINK market, some analysts believe the token may be due for a major retracement. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Surge Far From Done As Crypto Analyst Predicts Rise To $15 LINK To Fall Below $10: Is The Bullish Run Over? In a post on X on Friday, crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa shared a prediction that LINK may soon experience a price dip, falling as low as $9.50. However, Altcoin Sherpa notes that this potential price loss may not spell the end of LINK’s bullish phase. In fact, the analyst describes the token’s price coming down as “healthy.” According to Sherpa’s prediction, LINK’s slide below $10 could simply be a price recorrection before the token resumes its upward trajectory. If this forecast proves true, many traders could view this $9.50 region as a great entry zone. Interestingly, Cryptonary, another analyst on X, has recently shared a similar price prediction. In a post on Thursday, Cryptonary called for much caution in the LINK market, stating the crypto asset may not sustain its current high price levels for long. To back up this forecast, the analyst states the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that Chainlink is currently in the overbought zone, which indicates a price pullback lies on the horizon. Although many traders have opened long positions on LINK as indicated by the market’s positive funding rates, Cryptonary has advised investors against “joining the crowd” Similar to Altcoin Sherpa, the analyst predicts LINK’s price to fall to $9.67 for a short-term retracement. However, with strong selling pressure, Cryptonary states that LINK could trade as low as $8. At the time of writing, LINK trades around $11.54 with a 0.25% gain on the last day. Meanwhile, the token’s trading volume is up by 8.01% and valued at $824.92 million. Related Reading: Chainlink MVRV Enters Bearish Zone As LINK Breaks $10, Correction Soon?

This increased interest led to a robust phase of Total Value Locked (TVL) growth. Ultimately, this surge in demand for APT resulted in Aptos achieving its highest-ever TVL value of $74 million during the trading session on Thursday, October 26th. This surge in TVL is a crucial metric for decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, showcasing the total value of assets, tokens, or cryptocurrencies locked within the platform’s smart contracts.

Source: Coingecko This rally can be partially due to Aptos’ distinct position as a proof-of-stake blockchain that uses a cutting-edge smart contract programming language, to facilitate quicker and less expensive transactions on its network. For this reason, a lot of cryptocurrency fans frequently associate Aptos with certain decentralized Web3 applications, with a focus on the domain of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). 1/ 🎉 Aptos Community, we’re celebrating #AptosOne in style!

Despite concerns looming over a possible market retraction, the record-breaking TVL and the remarkable rise in APT’s value prompt a hopeful outlook, suggesting that Aptos and its native token may be well-positioned to weather potential market fluctuations and maintain their upward trajectory in the near future.

The price of INJ has remained unaffected by the extensive consolidation observed in the cryptocurrency market since Thursday. On Friday, it had a 10% increase, reaching a trading value of $13.15. The current market valuation of the coin stands at over $1 billion. This places the cryptocurrency at the 44th position in terms of rankings based on market capitalization. Related Reading: Bitcoin Braces For $50 Billion Influx Following ETF Launch, Bitwise CEO Says Injective Nears Historical Peak Amidst Strong Partnerships The interoperable Layer-1 blockchain, which facilitates the operation of decentralized finance apps (DApps) in the future generation, is approaching its historical peak value of $31.40, positioning it as one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies in the current year. Prominent blockchain protocol Injective has the support of Dallas Mavericks owner and billionaire Mark Cuban. At the time of writing, INJ was trading at $13.55, and registered a solid 59% increase in the last week, according to figures by crypto market tracker Coingecko. Source: Coingecko The price range of Injective hit a peak value of nearly $12.8 during a 24-hour period. This represents the highest value observed in almost two years. The rise in the value of the token cannot be attributed entirely to the recent surge in Bitcoin prices. The increase is also influenced by Injective’s efforts to strengthen its position in the market through its relationship with Google and the introduction of a new product by Helix exchange. Unlike other blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano, Injective’s focus is entirely on the financial industry. Provides developers with the tools they need to build dApps for a wide range of financial use cases, from lending and savings to derivatives trading and even oracles. The Injective network is notable for its lightning-fast processing speeds and low transaction fees. 1/ Introducing Injective Nexus: Injective’s official data integration & availability on Google Cloud.

The Google team said via a blog post: “Google Cloud to date has only offered BigQuery datasets for major blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum now, Injective will become part of this prominent group of Layer-1 chains.” Meanwhile, a bullish trend in the near and medium term is confirmed by a golden confluence in the Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) on the daily chart.

Its price has increased by 30%, reaching a new yearly high of $35,000, 10% above its previous peak this year. Interestingly, while the growth of Bitcoin is clear to see, the broader cryptocurrency market hasn’t quite managed to keep up. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To Reach $170,000 in 2025 – Mathematical Model Predicts Altcoin Market Cap The Altcoin market cap, which is the total cryptocurrency market cap excluding Bitcoin, has been trading within a descending triangle. This pattern, characterized by its lower highs and equal lows, often indicates a bearish trend in the market. This pattern suggests sellers are gradually overtaking buyers. A breakout from such a pattern is typically seen as a bullish indicator, with the target being the first peak. In this case, the Altcoin market cap would potentially see another 15% increase, matching the yearly highs in April. Crypto total market cap excluding BTC. Source: TOTAL2 on TradingView A similar pattern was seen in the previous cycle, where the Altcoin market cap was trading within a descending wedge. After the breakout, the Altcoin market cap saw an increase of 90%. Such historical trends show the importance of closely monitoring these patterns as potential indicators of market shifts. Contrastingly, as the Altcoin market cap is forming lower highs, Bitcoin’s price is forming new yearly highs. This dynamic suggests that Bitcoin is gaining market share from the rest of the crypto market. This is often referred to as ‘Bitcoin Season’. Bitcoin Season Bitcoin’s market share is at 54%, which is the highest it has been in over two years. The last time Bitcoin’s market share was at this level was during the bull market in 2021. As that year progressed, the asset began losing market share, as investors turned their attention to coins with lower capitalization, enticed by the prospect of higher returns. Now the trend seems to be reversing. Investors are gravitating back towards Bitcoin, lured by its higher returns than the rest of the crypto market. Bitcoin dominance (market share % in the cryptocurrency market). Source: BTC.D from TradingView The next resistance is at 58%, so if Bitcoin breaches this mark, it stands to gain an additional 5% in market share. Historical trends have shown that in the initial phases of bull markets, Bitcoin often takes charge, as it pushes on to create new all-time highs. This is typically driven through Bitcoin-centric narratives such as the halving which reduces the new supply of Bitcoin being mined. This year, heightened anticipation surrounds the potential approval of a Bitcoin ETF. If approved, it could pave the way for a wider range of investors to engage with the asset.

At spot rates, MKR is changing hands at near 2023 highs but is down 16% from October highs. Maker (MKR) Is Selling Off: The Bull Run Is Over? MKR is dumping at an unexpectedly faster pace, reversing gains posted in early Q4 2023, a concern. According to The Data Nerd, Falcon X sent 5,690 MKR worth $8.52 million to multiple exchanges, mainly OKX and Binance, at an average price of $1,497. Typically, whenever crypto whales begin sending tokens to centralized ramps, as currently is the case, it can be interpreted as bearish. That whales are moving their coins to exchanges could indicate that they are planning to liquidate and exit their position. Subsequently, this can dent sentiment, forcing the token to dump. However, the timeliness of the transfer also matters. In some instances, tokens can be moved to exchanges and interpreted as bullish. This is because, depending on the situation, whales could move them to provide liquidity for other traders. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Team Member Clarifies SHIB Burn As Shibarium Grows This can be the case with Falcon X. The platform provides institutional investors access to liquidity and execution services. Notably, Falcon X has, in the past, been used by other crypto exchanges and liquidity providers to offer other services. Since it acts on behalf of institutions and whales, it cannot be ascertained which of its clients is selling MKR. As of October 27, The Data Nerd statistics show that the platform holds 10,150 MKR worth $14.17 million at spot rates. Following the transfer, the tracker also shows that MKR is down 4%. The “End Game” Pumps MKR To New Highs, A Pull Back Incoming? Presently, MKR remains under pressure. As mentioned earlier, the token, though in an uptrend, rallying 170% in four months, is down 15% from October’s peaks. At the same time, there is a double top, a technical formation that may signal a local top. This pattern will only be invalidated if there is a sharp expansion above $1,650. Conversely, losses below $1,350 at the back of high participation levels could catalyze the sell-off. In May 2023, MakerDAO, the issuer of MKR–the governance token of the underlying borrowing and lending protocol, announced the launch of the “End Game.” Herein, the protocol plans to deploy on its independent blockchain, introduce new features, and launch two tokens.

19478667,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=557948,1698451244,"The Hidden Signals: Bitcoin’s On-Chain Data Points To Bullish Outlook, But There’s A Catch","Santiment, a leading blockchain intelligence platform, has recently provided insights pointing to a favorable short-term scenario for Bitcoin (BTC). However, according to other signals that seem ‘hidden,’ there’s a catch. These on-chain metrics can serve as the north star for investors looking to strategize their next steps. However, according to another metric, though recent revelations by Santiment might hint at continued positive momentum for Bitcoin, there’s also a possible contrary move that could play out. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Upcoming Leap? Analyst Predicts A Potential $45,500 Rise By November Bitcoin Sentiments Bullish On-Chain Indications Santiment’s recent post revealed a positive narrative for BTC’s immediate future. One of the key metrics supporting this bullish outlook is the significant number of active Bitcoin addresses. It is worth noting that an increase in active addresses can indicate enhanced adoption, investor interest, and overall network health. Furthermore, a surge in previously dormant tokens moving actively hints at a renewed trader interest. According to Santiment, such activity has often coincided with bullish trends, making this an essential metric to monitor. 👍 If you’re concerned about a #crypto retrace, note that #Bitcoin still maintains a high pace of active addresses. Additionally, the top market cap asset is seeing a high level of dormant tokens now moving, typically synonymous with #bullish conditions. https://t.co/bvjDL2Shga pic.twitter.com/NvxKkQpkg8 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 26, 2023 Given these disclosed metrics by Santiment, Bitcoin may still have more rallies to squeeze out. However, to add another layer of intrigue to the current market scenario is the behavior surrounding meme coins, especially PEPE. According to Onchain Capital co-founder and Crypto Banter host, Ran Neuner, meme coins, with their viral nature and swift price movements, sometimes act as a barometer for market sentiment, albeit unconventional. PEPE’s Performance: A Market Temperature Check? While Santiment’s report offers optimism, some market observers utilize unique indicators to sense potential market shifts. PEPE, a meme coin, has recently caught the attention of several prominent crypto figures. Ran Neuner recently mentioned that PEPE might act as an indicator of an overheated market. The logic? When traders and investors flock to such tokens, and they see significant price pumps, it might be a sign of excessive optimism in the market. An event to walk with caution. If you want to know when a pull back is coming, just watch $PEPE. It’s literally an index for when the market is getting overheated. When people are confident enough to go there and it pumps, that’s your sign to exit. Works every time. pic.twitter.com/vMcqiddHwp — Ran Neuner (@cryptomanran) October 26, 2023 Notably, PEPE has surged by more than 80% in the past week. The meme coin has soared from a low of $0.00000650 seen last Friday, to as high as $0.00000118 at the time of writing. Following the recent increase in price, PEPE is currently down 1.1% in the past 24 hours.

The asset currently trades at $33,620, at the time of writing down by 1.1% in the past hour.
