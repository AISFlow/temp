42398296,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT7H0,1427237866,Neteller Adds Bitcoin Deposit Option in Surprise Policy Reversal,"UPDATE (25th March 17:45 BST): This piece has been updated with additional information and comment from Optimal Payments, the parent company of Neteller.      Payments processor and prepaid card provider Neteller has added a bitcoin deposit feature.  A representative for Neteller confirmed the deposit feature when contacted for comment, telling CoinDesk it may be officially launched as early as tomorrow.  The move is an apparent reversal of policy for Neteller, which previously revised its terms of use policy to explicitly prohibit the “trade, exchange, purchase or sale of bitcoins, or any other virtual currency”.  Users of the service have since taken to social media to advertise the presence of a bitcoin option on the website. The spokesperson said that what users are reporting is likely the first stage of the integration.  “It is brand new,” the representative said, declining to elaborate further on the feature.  According to a 25th March press release provided by Optimal Payments, the parent company of Neteller, the integration was conducted in partnership with bitcoin payments processor BitPay.  Optimal Payments president and CEO Joel Leonoff said in a statement:  ""Neteller already provides merchants and customers a broad and diverse set of online payment options and the addition of bitcoin gives them another valuable payment method to help convert more transactions. We recognize the important role that crypto-currencies play in the future of payments and we look forward to working with BitPay as the acceptance rate grows.""  Optimal Payments  , which earlier this week made headlines for its agreement to purchase prepaid card provider Skrill for €1.1 billion. Neteller has long been associated with the online gaming industry, offering services to a number of well-known sites in the ecosystem. As such, the representative added that the service will not be available initially for users in the US.  CoinDesk will continue monitoring this developing story and provide updates as they become available.

The Swedesboro-Woolwich School District, which encompasses four elementary schools in Gloucester County, New Jersey, was forced to delay a statewide standardized test earlier this week after the ransomware was discovered over the weekend.  As reported by local news source the South Jersey Times, hackers behind the attack have demanded 500 BTC, worth roughly $125,000 at press time.  Investigators from the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are now looking into the matter in conjunction with local and state law enforcement agencies. The school district said a number of computer systems, including point-of-sale terminals and email access, have been impacted.  Superintendent Terry Van Zoren reported that the ransomware had brought tech activities to a halt, telling the news source:  ""There's basically no tech service happening in Swedesboro-Woolwich right now. Essentially our network has been taken over and has been made non-operational.""  The school district said that it planned to work around the issue by rebuilding the computer network, adding that it expected to complete the process by 24th March. As of Tuesday afternoon the situation was still unresolved.  CoinDesk reached out to the school district for further comment, but did not receive an immediate reply.

42398291,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT7C5,1427228126,Bitcoin Ponzi Scheme Operator Pleads Not Guilty to Fraud,"Bitcoin Savings & Trust (BS&T) operator Trendon Shavers has plead not guilty to fraud charges in a New York District court.  If convicted, Shavers faces up to 40 years in prison, as well as millions of dollars in potential fines and penalties. Shavers is charged with one count of securities fraud and one count of wire fraud.  The prosecution alleges that Shavers promised outsized returns to investors but in reality operated a Ponzi scheme by paying early investors with the proceeds from new ones. Shavers, who operated under the username pirateat40, solicited investors for BS&T during 2011 and 2012.  Shavers was found guilty of securities violations in September and was ordered to pay $40m in fines following the conclusion of a trial that began last July.  He was then arrested in November in connection with charges filed by the US Attorney’s Office in Manhattan. Shavers was taken into custody on 6th November and released on bail that same day.  The indictment stated that many of those who Shavers solicited ultimately lost their money, noting:  “In the end, at least 48 of approximately 100 investors lost all or part of their investment in BS&T. At the peak of his scheme, Shavers raised and had in his possession about 7% of the bitcoin that was in public circulation at the time.”  The court hearing, held 23rd March, was presided by District Judge Lewis Kaplan.  Ponzi scheme outlined  A court filing dated 15th March outlines the US Attorney’s Office case against Shavers, who raised more than 764,000 BTC ($188m at press time) from investors during the now-defunct BS&T operating period.  Shavers used both online mediums as well as in-person events to solicit investors. According to the indictment, Shaver misled investors by stating that hedge funds were involved with the company and that it was not a Ponzi scheme.  It was during this time that Shavers allegedly took client funds for personal use, including thousands of dollars worth of bitcoins to trade with on the Japan-based Mt Gox bitcoin exchange and later filter into a personal bank account and money account via the payment processor Dwolla.  The court filing reads:  “Specifically, Shavers transferred about 150,649 bitcoin to an account in Shavers’ name at Mt Gox (the “Shavers Mt Gox Account”). In connection with his trading on Mt Gox, Shavers lost the dollar equivalent of about $434,000 and misappropriated at least the dollar equivalent of about $147,000 of bitcoin for his own personal use.”  According to the document, Shavers spent investor funds on gambling and travel expenses, as well as general living expenses.

42398301,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT7Lv,1427224511,Startups Speak Out on Russia's Looming Bitcoin Ban,"“We don't plan to close.”  Such is the resolve of BTC-e, the largest exchange for the Russian ruble, heading into spring 2015. The informal date has been on the minds of many in the bitcoin community since it was first billed as when Russia would ban bitcoin in August of last year.  The most recent comments suggesting this probable future were issued by deputy finance minister Alexei Moiseev on 20th March. In new statements, the official in charge of coordinating Russia’s financial policy doubled down on his past terse dialogue toward cryptocurrencies, stating that the action will take place as previously announced.  While the rhetoric may suggest a battle between two staunchly opposed sides, interviews with domestic entrepreneurs indicate that Russia’s apparent anti-bitcoin stance has already done much to drive away any interest in the market.  Interviews with native or expatriate entrepreneurs suggest the evolution of Russia’s bitcoin market continues to attract more attention from media abroad than from those who would be positioned to serve its consumers.  The story of ALFAcoins CEO Vladimir Chelpanov, is indicative of the general narrative – the startup, which at first attempted to build a Russian alternative to BitPay, now doesn’t monitor the regulatory situation in Russia at all.  “At the moment, our business model excludes the Russian market,” Chelpanov told CoinDesk.  Chelpanov, however, is by no means alone. Regardless of the final decision, statements suggest Russia may already have done enough to halt its market growth.  Market spike  The statements of current and former Russian entrepreneurs stand in contrast to English-language headlines that suggest bitcoin has become an attractive option for Russian investors given the recent struggles of the ruble.  Anton Vereshchagin, founder of 247exchange, began positioning his bitcoin brokerage business toward the international market last year, and has since added a number of support services. The startup now boasts roughly 7,000 users.  Still, Vereshchagin took little interest in Russia's perceived market activity, suggesting it was more of a byproduct of how difficult it was to secure US dollars given that many foreign exchange brokers had ceased operations.  “People are scared that ruble will continue falling (especially the ones who had RUR balances at BTC-e), and are trying to buy bitcoins hoping that value of their savings will not decrease so much,” he said at the time.  Other market observers like Tuur Demester saw the situation differently, suggesting wealthy Russians may begin opening accounts with bitcoin exchanges to move out of the ruble.  Regardless of what might have been the behavior of Russian consumers at that time, data from Bitcoinity shows BTC/RUR trade volumes have once again settled on BTC-e, and it seems the spike in market activity did little to drive business interest.  Indacoin’s big decision  Bitcoin exchange Indacoin remains one of the few industry startups both openly serving the Russian market and basing its operations domestically, a decision that is currently weighing on the company's top executive.  CEO Stanislav Kosorukov told CoinDesk that he is watching regulatory developments in Russia closely as he considers relocating his eight-person team. He cited the cost of doing so as a factor to consider.  “We’re thinking about that and now we’re waiting,” Kosorukov said, adding that he expects to make a final decision in the spring, when the company’s financial picture is clearer.  The threat of action has still hindered the company, however, as Indacoin was previously dropped by Qiwi wallet, a Russian payments service partner that has since cut ties with the country's emerging bitcoin industry.  Currently, Kosorukov said the company’s main goal is to focus on its ability to offer credit and debit card services and margin trading as the exchanges differentiators. Indacoin estimates that 15% of its volume is from Russia, but he says there are few reasons to expect any growth.  “The community here is not so big and it would take us too much effort,” Kosorukov said.  International focus  Most startups with ties to the market now stress that their goal is to serve international customers broadly.  Boaz Bechar, CEO of block explorer BlockTrail, for example, is keen to stress that, despite the fact that one of its founders started Russia’s largest social network, the company doesn't need similar success in this market.  “While our co-founder and investor is of Russian background, Russia has never been a target market for us, both because of the regulatory environment, but primarily because we are aiming to create a global platform and not a localized service,” Bechar said.  He added that should the regulatory environment change, however, BlockTrail would consider engaging with consumers in the region, a statement echoed by many local market participants.  “BlockTrail will remain unaffected and indifferent on any decisions Russia wishes to make regarding bitcoin,” Bechar continued.  The boldest respondent may be BTC-e, which has suggested it will continue its activity in the RUR markets regardless of any actions by regulators or third-party partners that help it facilitate such trading.  BTC-e's statements suggest that Russia’s budding bitcoin community may continue to be served, even if monetary penalties are passed against its use.  “We don’t live in Russia,"" the exchange representative said.

LHV has been increasingly active in bitcoin, signing a deal with Coinbase in September to bring the company's bitcoin buying and selling services to 13 european countries.  Andres Kitter, head of retail at LHV Bank, said:  ""Services based on blockchain have the potential to change the world. We are very glad to start working with the Coinfloor team and helping them with reliable financial services in exploring this potential.""  LHV previously announced a project that set out to explore the legal framework and potential applications of blockchain technology in the banking sector.  At the time, Priit Rum, head of communications at LHV, told CoinDesk the bank was interested in the technological side of digital currencies, as it hoped to simplify bank services and make them more efficient.  Banking partnerships  The news comes amid increasing tension between bitcoin companies and the banking sector. Securing banking partnerships has hindered the operations of bitcoin companies, often forcing them to halt part of their offerings.  ""Coinfloor is a strong partner that takes compliance very seriously and for us as a bank this is very important,"" said Kitter.  Mark Lamb, CEO of Coinfloor, praised the bank's bitcoin expertise, saying that most banks understood bitcoin on a surface level. ""Coinfloor is thrilled to be partnering with LHV,"" he added.  Coinfloor's website states that it holds accounts with several other banks in Europe to avoid any downtime to its services. Previously, the exchange had partnered with Polish Bank PKO Bank Polski for its services, however LHV is now its main partner in the region.  Lamb added:  ""We will still maintain banking relationships in Poland, although we are moving all processing of client funds to LHV.""  Public audit  Besides banking partnerships, the exchange seeks to foster user confidence via monthly solvency reports, which act as a public audit of customers' balances. Coinfloor also stores 100% of its bitcoin in multisig cold-storage and claims to never hold users' bitcoin on a server.  A spokesperson said:  ""For fiat deposits, Coinfloor undertakes a number of measures, including proper due diligence (KYC) on each customer. The company goes to great lengths to make sure all client funds are kept with European banks that understand bitcoin and Coinfloor's business model"".

42398282,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT74D,1427192904,Survey: 9% of Americans 'Puzzled' by Bitcoin Logo,"9% of Americans were left feeling ""puzzled"" or ""confused"" after being shown the bitcoin logo, according to a recent survey by The Digital Currency Council (DCC).  The survey, which asked 504 people across the United States to provide a one word response to the logo, also found that 7% felt ""nothing"".  Approximately 5% of those surveyed recognised that the image had something to do with either ""money"" or ""wealth"", whilst 3% noted that it represented bitcoin.  The survey also found that 2% of people expressed indifference and the remaining 1% failed to know what the symbol meant. The remaining responses can be viewed here.  David Berger, founder and CEO of the Digital Currency Council, spoke about the implications of the results:  ""What does this mean for bitcoin as a brand? Quite simply, the diversity in response means that the brand doesn't yet stand for much of anything. Mainstream America doesn't know much about bitcoin yet, so there is plenty of room for its re-introduction.""  He added: ""That said, this is also evidence that past outreach and educational efforts have yet to establish a meaningful and common understanding amongst most consumers.""
