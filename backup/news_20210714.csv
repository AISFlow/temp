The film production company Optimist is behind the documentary, with Carrie Weprin producing and Zach Ingrasci and Chris Temple co-directing. Weprin and Ingrasci had both been aware of the crypto ecosystem before getting involved in the project, but they said the interviews they’ve done for the film really turned them into Ethereum fans.      Funding for “Ethereum: The Infinite Garden” is taking place on Mirror until Friday, July 16, with a goal of raising 750 ETH (about $1.5 million at today’s prices). As of press time, 67 people had contributed a total of 60.3 ETH.      For the filmmakers, crypto crowdfunding felt like the most authentic way to raise funds for the film because it allows members of the community to get involved and shape the outcome of the project, which is still currently in the early stages of development.      “I think it’s so exciting that a DAO [decentralized autonomous organization] could be our executive producer,” Ingrasci said. “That would be the first time that’s ever happened for a film. For sure the executive producer will be someone from the community. This is why we wanted to involve the community as early as possible.”      Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) designed by crypto artist pplpleasr are available for purchase on Mirror, with each denoting a level of involvement in the project.      Morgan Beller, co-creator of libra and now an investor at NFX, connected the Optimist team to Buterin.      “I’ve always thought Buterin deserved to have his story out there. The whole Ethereum team is just so pure, authentic, kind and wonderful,” Beller said, adding:    “If you’re first learning about Ethereum and you’re not a crypto person, you don’t necessarily see that side. But I always thought that if the world were able to somehow see and understand where this is all coming from, the heart and thoughts behind it, people would both understand it and be more supportive.”    Weprin said the team hopes to place the film in a major film festival in 2023 and will likely pursue distribution on major streaming platforms.",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/14/vitalik-buterin-is-involved-in-a-new-documentary-about-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc280ac9d1ba4d05e9f2189ddf50e7ba5ef547da-1500x791.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Powell's comments come after Tuesday’s U.S. Labor Department report that inflation accelerated in June by the fastest pace in 13 years. Bitcoin is seen by some investors as a hedge against inflation because of the cryptocurrency's fixed supply schedule.      “What helped cryptocurrencies turn positive was the broad-based rally on Wall Street,” Edward Moya, senior market strategist at Oanda, wrote in an email. “The Fed seems stubbornly dovish and willing to tolerate a few more months of surging pricing pressures before considering a change of tune over the transitory/persistent inflation debate.”    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $32,787.2, +1.62%  Ether (ETH) $1,986.1, +3.19%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4374.3, +0.12%  Gold: $1827.1, +1.04%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.344%, compared with 1.41% on Tuesday    Ether tracked higher with bitcoin, but among altcoins the day’s big story was a jump in price for the FOX token after the backing ShapeShift exchange announced plans to become more decentralized and airdrop the token.    Looking for clues    With bitcoin stuck in the $30,000 and $40,000 range for eight weeks now, cryptocurrency analysts are scouring blockchain data for clues on which way the market will go.      David Grider, head of digital assets at FundStrat, wrote Wednesday in a weekly report that he is looking closely at the “spent output profit ratio,” or SOPR. The metric is calculated by dividing the average price at which bitcoin was sold by the average price at which it was bought.      Writes Grider: “When SOPR is above 1, it implies owners of the asset are in profit at the time of the transaction. Below 1 implies sellers have capitulated and sold at a loss.”      The metric has stayed below 1 since May, possibly a sign there’s a “healthy reset of profit taking,” reminiscent of a similar episode that played out in March 2020, at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Several months after that, bitcoin prices rallied and ended up quadrupling on the year.      “In a bull market, as we expect we are in today, a SOPR below 1 can indicate a local bottom as sellers are reluctant to sell at a loss,” Grider wrote.    Powell talks stablecoins    Jerome Powell spent much of his semiannual testimony before the House Financial Services Committee addressing the outlook for the U.S. economy, the prospects for inflation and the likely path of monetary policy.      He was also questions on cryptocurrencies, as reported by CoinDesk’s Nate DiCamillo.      U.S. Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, the. ranking Republican on the committee, asked when the Fed would deliver its much-anticipated report on central bank digital currencies (CBDC) and crypto.      Powell said that report, previously expected to arrive this month, will appear in September.      “U.S. regulation, along with environmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns, are the biggest risks to cryptos, so a September Fed release of [the central bank's] concerns on digital currencies should be viewed as good news for bitcoin,” according to Oanda’s Moya.      Powell also weighed in on stablecoins, arguing they will need to be more closely regulated if they are going to be a major part of U.S. payments networks.      “Stablecoins certainly have some advantages in terms of faster payment systems and have some attributes of CBDCs, but there are some risks with stablecoins right now,” Powell said. “I think the issue is that stablecoins are a lot like money market funds or bank deposits or a narrow bank.”      In response to a question from Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.), Powell said the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency isn’t in danger of being threatened, even as other countries develop CBDCs.      The chairman said central bank digital currencies might undermine the case for decentralized digital assets.      “You wouldn’t need stablecoins, you wouldn’t need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital U.S. currency,” Powell said. “I think that’s one of the stronger arguments in its favor.”    ShapeShift shutdown    Crypto trading pioneer ShapeShift is closing its doors, handing over its legacy to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) controlled by holders of its FOX token.      As it begins a months-long process of closing up shop, it will begin by airdropping $98 million in crypto to decentralized finance (DeFi) investors across multiple blockchains.      Following the news, the price of ShapeShift’s exchange token FOX surged. FOX was changing hands at $0.51 as of press time; before the news went out this morning, the token was trading at $0.28. It hit $0.68 about an hour after the 11:00 a.m. ET announcement.    Altcoin Roundup  AXS Rally: The rally in Axie Infinity’s governance token AXS is showing no signs of slowing down as users continue to flock to the play-to-earn battle economy amid lackluster action in the broader crypto markets. The AXS token clocked a new record high of $23.60 early Wednesday, surpassing the previous peak of $22.50 reached Tuesday, according to data source Messari. Axie Infinity shards, or AXS, is the governance token of the Axie Infinity platform, an Ethereum-based digital marketplace for the game Axie Infinity. “Axie Infinity, created by SkyMavis, allows players to earn income through non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, and cryptocurrencies by breeding, battling and trading digital pets called Axies,"" a Philippines-based Axie trader told CoinDesk.  Chia continues expansion: Chia Network, the smart transaction platform created by BitTorrent founder Bram Cohen, has added five executives across multiple divisions, including sales, product development and professional services, and has nearly doubled its workforce since closing its last venture round in early May.

Other participating investors included Variant Fund, Jump Capital, DeFi Alliance, the Solana Foundation and Coinbase investor Garry Tan.

Barkley made his announcement on an episode of Joe Pompliano’s new show on YouTube, ""The Best Business Show.""      “You see how high [inflation] is and you learn you can’t save yourself through wealth,” Barkley said on the show. “That's why I am going to be taking my marketing money in bitcoin.""      Barkley said he was influenced by conversations he had with Jack Mallers, the CEO of Strike who was also on the show, in making his decision. Strike uses the Lightning Network payments platform to convert direct deposits made into checking accounts into bitcoin. Mallers said the product Barkley will be using to be paid in bitcoin will be rolled out to all users in the U.S. in the next 30 to 60 days.      Pompliano put Barkley’s annual endorsement earnings in the “eight-plus figures.” Barkley has signed deals in the past with Nike, Pepsi, Visa and Dunkin’ Donuts, among others.      “I think it’s just a smart thing to do and the right thing to do to start taking my investment money in bitcoin and through Strike,” Barkley added.      Barkley, who was drafted by the Giants with the No. 2 pick in 2018, was the National Football League's offensive rookie of the year but was out almost all of last year with an injury. He has a four-year, $31.2 million contract with the Giants that included a $20.8 million signing bonus.

The SEC alleges Coinschedule, a once-popular website that profiled initial coin offerings (ICOs) from 2016 to 2019, was secretly receiving compensation from the issuers of the digital assets it was profiling.      The settled charges against Coinschedule are among a series of charges recently brought by the SEC against operators of ICOs the regulator has deemed fraudulent or otherwise in violation of federal securities law. The SEC has taken an increasingly strong stance against unregistered token offerings since the ICO boom of 2017, deeming them unregistered securities.      Blotics agreed to a settlement that includes a $43,000 disgorgement plus prejudgement interest, a penalty of $153,434 and an agreement to stop violating the anti-touting provisions.      Two SEC commissioners, Elad Roisman and Hester Peirce, issued a statement that they agreed Coinschedule was violating federal law, but they lamented the settlement did not offer any regulatory clarity for other market participants.      “We agree with our colleagues that touting securities without disclosing the fact that you are getting paid, and how much, violates Section 17(b),” Peirce and Roisman wrote. “We nevertheless are disappointed that the commission’s settlement with Coinschedule did not explain which digital assets touted by Coinschedule were securities, an omission of which is symptomatic of our reluctance to provide additional guidance about how to determine whether a token is being sold as part of a securities offering or which tokens are securities.”",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/07/14/sec-settles-charges-against-coinschedule-operator-for-touting-icos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/982e78e842d63b131518aa95f522772b7c8c13a5-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434826,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtkjh,1626287292,The Headache of 'Crypto Colonialism',"Ethiopia is suffering a humanitarian disaster. After months of armed conflict, roads and bridges across the Tigray province are in ruins. Electricity and telephone lines have been cut. Only 15% of Ethiopians have access to the internet at the best of times.      With a civil war in full swing and essential infrastructure in tatters in remote areas, it might seem to be a strange time to kick off the country’s digital revolution. But the developers behind the Cardano cryptocurrency, IOHK, have announced that the U.S. tech firm will help Ethiopia rise from the wreckage. The Colorado-based company has been here for over four years planning blockchain-based citizen ID and educational record systems, as well as various supply chain management tools.    Pete Howson is a senior lecturer in International Development at the University of Northumbria, where he has researched tradeoffs in ""crypto-giving"" efforts.    The initial plan is for a Cardano application to be used to digitally track students’ grades and academic performances across the country. The developers then hope to expand the system incorporating an Ethiopia-wide cryptocurrency payment system, before connecting the entire African continent together with Cardano infrastructure. The platform could possibly enable access to crypto loans or “DeFi” (decentralized finance).      With COVID-19, war, famine and much of Ethiopia’s population already living “well below any reasonable conception of a life with dignity,” a United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty said, the project might seem like a pie in the sky idea. The company’s optimistic investors think otherwise. The deal’s announcement pushed Cardano’s ADA token to all-time price highs in May.      Blockchain projects can do very little to repair the roads and build strong political institutions in places like Ethiopia. Innovators are not drawn to fragile states because they want to fix these things. Poverty and corruption are the ideal conditions for entrepreneurs exploring opportunities to extract resources from vulnerable communities.      Cardano’s also chasing opportunities in El Salvador. Last month, the country’s president, Nayib Bukele, and a 27-year-old crypto investor, Jack Mallers from Chicago, proclaimed bitcoin the Central American country’s new official currency. Starting in September, all Salvadoran vendors with an internet connection will be breaking the country’s “Bitcoin Law” if they aren’t offering crypto-payment options.      Mallers presented his big bitcoin experiment just weeks after the U.S. threatened to pull El Salvador’s aid package following “deep concerns” around civil liberties, extrajudicial killings and human rights abuses. Despite claims that Bitcoin will help El Salvador’s poorest by “banking the unbanked,” research from Northumbria University in the U.K. looking at ""Blockchain for Good"" projects across the Global South, suggest it’s the economic benefits, including land, user data and other resources, that are the main drawing cards for these experiments. Critics have a name for this sort of extractive experimenting: “crypto-colonialism.”      It works like this: In the spirit of right-wing economists like Milton Friedman, blockchain innovators seek out populations suffering debt crises, war, climate disasters, etc. to impose and incubate new crypto-economic ideas. For the host government, struggling to deliver social services and infrastructure projects while suffering from chronic under-investment, its lack of tax revenue and regulations is the real headache. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain services often make those headaches worse, not better.    Populations can be easily disciplined just with code, not cannons    Puerto Rico serves as an example. After hurricanes Irma and María devastated the island, cryptocurrency investors set sail to build a new crypto-libertarian Jerusalem, otherwise known as “Puertopia.” The island soon became a highly contested sandbox for cryptocurrencies. For Jillian Crandall, a researcher at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, these crypto-colonialist projects might be called “disaster capitalism.”      Yet state-adverse tech companies typically tout the advantages of evading taxes via cryptocurrencies as a means of encouraging foreign investment and an entrepreneurial spirit among the locals.      Proponents of the Ethiopia-Cardano deal suggest the partnership will work wonders for corruption and transparency. Our research suggests a more dystopic outlook.      With the use of smart contracts, centralized surveillance capabilities and automated conditions can be encoded into payment platforms. Individual citizens, and even whole populations, can lose their economic sovereignty, while tech companies and central governments track and manage how citizens' funds can be spent.      John O’Connor, Cardano’s Africa director, said the company's crypto experiments make a much bigger splash in the poorest parts of Africa, relative to only marginal improvements for countries like the U.K. But digital ID schemes have always proven to be an intolerably hot potato in the U.K., consistently rejected by the public because of snooping concerns.    Read more: US Financial Surveillance Agency Wants to Know More About Privacy Tech    Not so, in the Global South. Global tech companies, with the help of autocratic politicians in financial pickles, are imposing systems of crypto-surveillance without public debate on entire populations. This includes refugees and other vulnerable groups. In Tigray, where local interests sit squarely at odds with the Ethiopian government, unruly populations can be easily disciplined. Just with code, not cannons.      Blockchains can’t rebuild roads, or end sectarian violence, famine or natural disasters. When countries like Ethiopia need to bounce back from war, they ultimately need support rebuilding infrastructure and strong democratic institutions, including effective legal and tax systems.

42434822,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtkdh,1626286116,Australia Faces Big Choices on Crypto Regulation,"The Select Committee on Australia as a Technology and Financial Centre has launched a new round of consultation to review the federal policy framework around cryptocurrency and blockchain technology in Australia.      This provides an epic opportunity for Australia to lead the way on the next wave of digital innovation globally. A policy approach that allows for more clarity and flexibility for cryptocurrency business models will help to deliver economic growth not seen here since the rising commodity prices of the mid-2000s. However, with a heavy-handed, old-fashioned approach, the Australian economy could find itself lagging behind other nations willing to take a risk on decentralized technology.    Fred Schebesta is a co-founder of financial comparison website Finder.    Get it completely wrong, and Australia risks losing our most talented engineers and business leaders, who may exit the country to build the future of finance in overseas markets that better embody innovation.      The good news is the review is being chaired by Sen. Andrew Bragg, a forward-thinking Liberal party member who has his finger on the pulse of fintech developments globally. He has been a key advocate for the new Consumer Data Right (CDR) regime, which is a major policy intervention that introduced a data-sharing framework for Australian consumers. The CDR regime allows customers to share details on where they’ve been spending their money, which drives useful consumer tools like budgeting apps.      Outside of Australia, these government-led banking data-sharing arrangements are often referred to as “Open Banking” but it is testament to the scale and ambition of the CDR reform that describing it as Open Banking actually undersells the framework. The CDR is rapidly building the rules and rails for an economy-wide data sharing program that is unparalleled anywhere around the world. This means Australians will not only be able to share their banking data with third-parties building useful tools but also their energy, telco and insurance data. This will make much easier for Australians to make better decisions throughout their lives.    Read more: Crypto Adoption in Australia Grows Along With Concern Over Volatility    Once CDR is fully implemented for banking later this year the framework will be introduced to the markets for energy, telecommunications and insurance products. On the international stage, the CDR is already highlighting Australia as a nation taking digital economic growth superseriously. It’s also good to see the review being done by elected politicians at a federal level who have the mandate to set policy direction rather than these decisions sitting with regulators.    The issue with crypto in Australia right now    To date, Australian regulation on cryptocurrency is still nascent. Currently, Australian law does not treat cryptocurrency as money and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has no plans to release a central bank digital currency (CBDC) to retail customers.      Cryptocurrencies have been brought into scope for Australia's anti-money laundering framework, which does mean crypto exchanges need to register with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Elsewhere, the Australian Tax Office (ATO) has attempted to clarify how cryptocurrency is taxed for consumers in Australia but there is still confusion. Cryptocurrencies held by consumers with a profit-making intention are taxed like any other capital gain while those used for business purposes are treated as trading stock.      What is missing, though, is a consistent position on this sector at a federal level.      And that’s where this consultation comes in. So what can we expect from this Senate consultation on cryptocurrency and digital assets?      Primarily, the Committee has been tasked with finding ideas and recommendations that will promote Australia as a financial technology center through the blockchain and cryptocurrency sector. We know this is an industry that certainly can deliver significant economic growth but the committee will also be looking to ensure that Australian consumers are well protected.    Extending the fintech sandbox    One option the committee is likely to explore is extending the nation’s fintech sandbox to include cryptocurrency and blockchain projects. This approach has been favored by the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. and the recently introduced fintech sandbox in Spain. Sandboxes are fast becoming table stakes for innovative fintech businesses looking for a market to run their operations from, so it would be remiss for the committee not to explore this route.      World Bank research also shows these sandboxes work for both private firms and regulators, providing space for businesses to test new ideas with lower compliance costs while also giving regulators strong oversight on new projects pushing the boundaries of what is possible.    Read more: More Aussies Back Bitcoin, the Underdog | Adrian Przelozny    One important issue for the committee to consider here is whether to include crypto products in the current sandbox (and thus consider defining them as financial products) or to create a new one focused on cryptocurrency. The latter would be more work but also allow for a new bespoke approach rather than a rehashed version of old policy frameworks.    Consolidate a regulatory team    While exploring the sandbox, the committee might well also look at the regulators more broadly. Similar to other markets, cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) regulation in Australia is currently being looked at by a mixture of regulators. It would be good to see Australia consolidate the policy and regulatory people working in this space into a single specialized regulatory unit.      This is a complex space where strong domain expertise is absolutely critical for these teams to make the right calls for different projects. If this does occur, I wouldn’t be surprised to see extensive recruitment efforts from the new unit to ensure it has all the skills required to do the job well.    Debunking de-banking    Next up, the Select Committee will also inevitably look closely at when and if banks can restrict banking services to businesses engaging in delivering services related to cryptocurrency. The practice of “de-banking” has hit both individuals and business involved in cryptocurrency in Australia hard for a number of years. This practice is at best stifling innovation and at worst anti-competitive.      Banks are nervous about cryptocurrency. While some level of discomfort holds merit, the digital asset ecosystem has seen rapid worldwide maturation contrasted by little movement forward in its treatment from banks in the Australian market. The government has a role to play in ensuring that vested interests aren’t unfairly protecting the status quo. A strong position on the practice from this Select Committee would set a precedent and, if issues of anti-competitiveness are identified, we could well see a review on the practice from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.    Pushing the boundaries    If the committee wants to encourage inward investment it could also look at introducing innovative policies. Perhaps a new accreditation scheme for Australian projects that want to receive cryptocurrency deposits from consumers? This would give these cryptocurrency businesses clear standards and rules to adhere to whilst acknowledging these organizations are different to banks.      Importantly, this approach would give these businesses a legal status that will help to legitimize them in the eyes of consumers, regulators and other organizations. The committee could also explore a government-backed guarantee for a certain amount of cryptocurrency deposited in these government-accredited wallets. It does the same for fiat deposits in authorized deposit-taking institutions, so why not apply the same approach here?      It could also revisit its position on creating a central bank digital currency or stablecoin. This would show real commitment to taking DeFi seriously and there could be some interesting tax opportunities for the federal government if it captured a small transaction fee on an Australian dollar-linked stablecoin that was created or backed by the RBA.      Regardless of what the committee decides, it is clear that this is a once in a decade opportunity for Australia to take a strong position on decentralized technology. I’m excited and hopeful to see Australia take this opportunity by the horns.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Fred Schebesta,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/14/australia-faces-big-choices-on-crypto-regulation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4476f93a59e1891d4fb96997e0ab8573ca7b84c6-2400x1601.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42434824,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtkZh,1626285766,Bitcoin Is Already Incentivizing Renewable Energy,"The idea that bitcoin mining could subsidize and catalyze a greener electricity grid is already playing out. It was announced today that Compass Mining, a startup that crowdsources hashrate, inked a 20-year deal with Oklo, a nuclear fission company that builds microreactors, to supply the crypto network with low-cost, carbon-neutral power.      Set to go live in 2023 or 2024, the partnership is a “beacon” for the intersection of cryptocurrency and clean-energy development, Oklo CEO Jacob DeWitte told CoinDesk’s Nathan DiCamillo. The deal sees Compass sop up excess energy from various microreactors – with the potential for nuclear sites eventually to be dedicated to bitcoin mining.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    “As demand might change by a few megawatts here and there, you can put that off into bitcoin mining,” DeWitte said.      Climate activists and lawmakers have looked askance at crypto’s energy-heavy environmental footprint. The same qualities that make Bitcoin a secure, permissionless and tamper-proof payments network also make it an energy guzzler.      But crypto industry advocates have argued that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are an essential part of developing a carbon-neutral grid.      “Bitcoin miners are unique energy buyers in that they offer highly flexible and easily interruptible load, provide payout in a globally liquid cryptocurrency, and are completely location agnostic, requiring only an internet connection,” according to “Bitcoin Is Key to an Abundant, Clean Energy Future,” a 2021 white paper authored by Square and ARK Invest.      This seems like a fanciful idea – and one that has rightfully received pushback – but it’s also happening in real time. Square is funding a solar-powered bitcoin mining facility with Blockstream, El Salvador is looking to tap into vast geothermal reserves as a mining experiment and several crypto firms are getting more involved in carbon offset programs.    Read more: ‘Green’ Bitcoin Is the Price of Mass Adoption | Ben Schiller    The economic incentives of bitcoin mining allow firms to “overbuild” renewable energy sources. Solar and wind are intermittent sources of power – the sun doesn’t always shine and wind doesn’t always blow – but bitcoin mining can easily be turned on or off during periods of peak demand or low supply.      Of course, there are other environmental considerations of bitcoin mining. The dedicated computer chips for churning through cryptographic puzzles to secure the network are resource intensive and have a short shelf life (due to competitive pressure to upgrade and also burnout). And nuclear power is a whole other area of concern.

In a Tuesday order launching proceedings on whether or not the agency should approve the application, the SEC asked for feedback from the general public and industry experts on the WisdomTree application and whether the ETF would be a safe product for investors. Comments must be submitted within three weeks of the document's publication in the Federal Register, the national logbook, with rebuttals filed within seven weeks.  The SEC is currently reviewing over a dozen active bitcoin ETF applications. Industry participants, including WisdomTree, have also filed applications for an ether ETF product and a bitcoin futures ETF. The federal securities regulator has yet to approve any crypto ETF within the U.S., though proponents claim that a bitcoin ETF can help investors by creating a more regulated market.  The SEC has typically delayed making any firm decisions on bitcoin ETF applications as long as it legally could, meaning Tuesday's delay is no surprise. This is the second active application to proceed to this phase of SEC rulemaking in 2021, joining a similar application filed by VanEck, indicating the process for potentially approving an ETF continues to move ahead.  Proponents also believe that a bitcoin ETF will expand access to the crypto markets. Because an ETF is regulated, some fund managers, financial institutions or even retail investors may be more willing to purchase shares of an ETF, rather than buy bitcoin directly.  Still, the chances of the SEC approving a bitcoin ETF seem slim. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has raised concerns about bitcoin market manipulation and investor protection during testimony before Congress. The agency has often cited market manipulation as a key concern in rejecting past bitcoin ETF applications.  Indeed, the SEC published questions around whether the ETF ""would be susceptible to manipulation"" and how the proposed product could be protected from fraudulent activity in its decision on Tuesday.

42434814,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtkNh,1626281839,Jerome Powell: CBDC Report Coming in Early September,"U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said a Fed report on central bank digital currencies (CBDC) would come in early September, during a Wednesday hearing before the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services.      In response to a question from ranking member Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), Powell said the report will outline the benefits and risks of CBDCs, as well as cryptocurrencies and stablecoins more broadly. In the hearing, Powell reiterated that stablecoins need regulation if they are going to play a major part within U.S. payments networks.      ""Stablecoins certainly have some advantages in terms of faster payment systems and have some attributes of CBDCs but there are some risks with stablecoins right now,"" Powell said. ""I think the issue is that stablecoins are a lot like money market funds or bank deposits or a narrow bank.""      Powell had previously announced that a policy report on a digital dollar would be published in July.      The Boston branch of the Federal Reserve announced last year it was conducting research into what a possible CBDC would need to have to be useful within the U.S., and it is expected to write the document. A spokesperson told CoinDesk the Boston Fed still anticipated publishing the report in the third quarter of 2021.      In response to a question from Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.), Powell added the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency isn't in danger of being threatened, even as other countries develop CBDCs.      The chairman also added that digital currencies could replace decentralized digital assets.      ""You wouldn't need stablecoins you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies if you had a digital U.S. currency, I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor,"" Powell said.      In response to Rep. Anthony Gonzalez (R-Ohio), Powell also confirmed the paper would review tether, which Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, listed among the “financial stability challenges” the U.S. central bank is watching.      ""In both of the last two financial crises, during the acute phase of the crisis the [commercial paper] market just disappeared, and that's when people will want their money,"" Powell said. ""These are economic activities that are very similar to bank deposits and money market funds and they need to be regulated.""

The “in-flight transaction” tracker received Series A investments from Foundry Group, Blockchain Capital Robot Ventures and others, CEO Matt Cutler told CoinDesk. Rho Capital’s Ignition Fund led the round. Last July Blocknative raised $5 million in a seed round.      Blocknative’s tools surveil the mempool – digital waiting rooms for not-yet-validated crypto transactions – to get a sense of upcoming on-chain activity. Shedding light on this “dark forest” can help projects estimate gas fees, detect attackers and track “in-flight transactions” that haven’t settled in their wallets yet, Cutler said.      Front-running bots on the Ethereum network have become an issue for professional traders.    Read more: Ethereum Trading Bot Strategy ‘Extracted’ $107M in 30 Days, Research Suggests    Mempool data is publicly available, but Cutler said it's nearly impossible for laypersons to parse. Only a handful of companies in the space are currently building tools for the mempool, he said, but he expects that to change as the market grows.      The market has so far responded with gusto. Annual recurring revenue has spiked 1,500% with well-known projects including Compound, Curve, Zapper and Yearn Finance signing up in the last 12 months. About 40% of Blocknative customers are “builders” such as them, Cutler said. The other 60% are traders hoping to leverage mempool data.      “The trading category has grown really rapidly – it came from basically zero” at this point last year, Cutler said.      Altonomy Ventures, the investment firm based in Singapore, began using Blocknative eight months ago as a way to confirm its transactions were executing on decentralized exchanges, head of investments Ricky Li said.      “There’s a lot of very basic things that you enjoy trading at a centralized exchange,” he said, offering order execution notifications as an example. “But on the DeFi side if you trade on 1inch or Uniswap, you don’t have the luxury of that. We send an order out, it’s like sending it into a black hole,” he said.      Beyond tracking “in-flight” orders, Li said Altonomy Ventures has also leveraged mempool intelligence for an all-important edge on cutthroat digital trading floors to avoid being front-run.      A majority of the top decentralized finance protocol builders are also using Blocknative to shore up their networks, according to Blockchain Capital partner Spencer Bogart, who sits on Blocknative's board.      “If you're very proactively monitoring the mempool, you can run blocknative simulation platform to detect if any of those transactions” would pose a threat to the protocol once they confirm, he said.      Cutler plans to double Blocknative’s 20-person staff by year’s end, with new hires in marketing, sales, C-suite, customer support and development.      “We're trying to build a real core infrastructure that's going to be sustained and grow as the whole ecosystem grows,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | YFI,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/07/14/blocknative-raises-12m-to-follow-crypto-transactions-in-flight,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec76ba97e494b636a0189bcd9dfbda870a4c0026-1280x749.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

AXS token clocked a new record high of $23.60 early today, surpassing the previous peak of $22.50 reached Tuesday, according to data source Messari.  The cryptocurrency was changing hands at $23.86 at press time, up 700% from the low of $2.36 reached on June 22, when the broader market tanked and bitcoin fell below $30,000 for the first time since early January.  Axie Infinity shards, or AXS, is the governance token of the Axie Infinity platform, an Ethereum-based digital marketplace for the game Axie Infinity.  ""Axie Infinity, created by SkyMavis, allows players to earn income through non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, and cryptocurrencies by breeding, battling and trading digital pets called Axies,"" a Philippines-based Axie trader told CoinDesk.  Players use AXS tokens to trade these digitized creatures. AXS holders can also stake their coins to earn weekly rewards and participate in governing the protocol. New entrants have to purchase at least three axies priced in ether, and the protocol makes money through axie sales, land sales, axie breeding fees and marketplace fees.  Data tracked by Token Terminal shows Axie has raked in $51.3 million in the past 30 days, the most among decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and blockchains tracked by the site. That's four times more than the second highest, PancakeSwap with $12 million.  According to DappRadar, the game is quite popular and is viewed as an income source in developing countries like Brazil, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Venezuela.  Axie Infinity has widened its lead over prominent DeFi protocols like PancakeSwap, Uniswap and Compound in terms of revenue collection since CoinDesk's last update.

As it begins a months-long process of closing up shop, it will begin by airdropping $98 million in crypto to decentralized finance (DeFi) investors across multiple blockchains (more on that value estimate below).      Founded in 2014 by Erik Voorhees, the Colorado-based ShapeShift announced today it will begin winding down its operations as a formal company. Currently employing 65 people, ShapeShift will have no employees, no bank accounts and no CEO in somewhere between four and 12 months' time, according to Voorhees.      ""It's definitely radical,"" Voorhees said in a phone call, adding:    ""A year ago I would have thought this was sort of fanciful, but at this point I've seen how this tool is getting built and I've seen how these communities get built around a token instead of an equity structure. The fact that ShapeShift is really closing its corporate entity sets it apart.""    Many companies in crypto build a decentralized protocol but leave a business standing that takes part in creating profit atop their blockchain creation (case in point, Compound Labs just launched Treasury to do precisely that). Calling the move ""true decentralization,"" Voorhees said ShapeShift is going a step further.      To get more people involved in this new incarnation of the ShapeShift project, it is airdropping 340 million FOX tokens to all past users of ShapeShift (around 900,000 addresses) and 120,000 addresses on several well-known DeFi protocols.    Will you get the airdrop?    Users of ShapeShift and many flavors of DeFi will get part of the drop.      At the time of this writing, the price of FOX is trading at about $0.29, with an all-time high of $1.65 in April. There's a total supply of 1,000,001,337 FOX tokens with no inflation.      Of that, 34% is getting distributed to the community and to other crypto communities, 32% will be distributed to ShapeShift staff, 24% to the ShapeShift DAO (of which FOX token holders will have control), 7.5% to the Foundation (which will steward whatever can't be decentralized now until it can) and 1.3% to the company to use as it winds down.      There are approximately 10 million FOX tokens already in the wild now.      At the opening of this post we wrote that the airdrop was worth $98 million, but, honestly, that's a wild guess. That assumes the price of FOX stays basically the same as the airdrop begins, an unlikely supposition; but any other guess would be even worse.      There are many different ways a user might get an airdrop. The details can be found on ShapeShift's blog, but here's the really key point for everyone concerned: Airdrops have to be claimed within 90 days. After that, airdrops will gradually reduce to nothing over the following 10 days and everything left over converts to the DAO.      Here's who will get the airdrop: First of all, everyone who has ever used ShapeShift in any way. More usage yields more FOX. More kinds of usage also yields more, so if a user made trades and has a KeepKey connected, that will yield a larger airdrop.      ShapeShift is also making a small airdrop to users of lots of different DeFi protocols, including Gitcoin, Uniswap, Yearn and several others.      There will also be an airdrop for various users of Thorchain.      The checks for those eligible were mostly made as of June 9, 2021, so the relevant activity has to have taken place before then. For Thorchain, eligibility ends on June 16.      FOX isn't needed to use ShapeShift, but it makes the experience better, as Voorhees explained. Holders are able to earn income from the platform, for example.      Users who get the airdrop and want to earn more will also be able to take part in liquidity mining, starting on July 16. Much like Synthetix early on, ShapeShift will reward users who become liquidity providers to key Uniswap pools that help increase liquidity depth for the FOX token.      For the next three months, 15.8 million FOX tokens have been set aside to encourage Uniswap liquidity. After that, it will be up to governance.    The company    ShapeShift's name is apt at this point.      The company has taken several forms. It has evolved from an identity-free facilitator of crypto trades, to an exchange, to something Voorhees says there is no great term for now.      It's become a sort of control panel that allows a crypto user to both monitor their positions and conduct economic activity across multiple blockchains.      ""We're essentially a crypto interface,"" Voorhees said, and it has been built with an eye toward integrating with any wallet, app, blockchain or primitive entrepreneurs want to build.      There are, it should be noted, parts of ShapeShift that could be complicated to run via a DAO, such as its hardware division, KeepKey. Its future remains a question mark for now. It could be spun off into its own company, for example.      As the founder of his company, Voorhees was not especially wistful about the end of this era. He said he looked forward to getting rid of all the bureaucracy he's been burdened with.      Voorhees is hopeful, however, that the move could deepen his relationships with users and builders. ""The most meaningful part of a company is the people. I'm hoping this enhances those relationships,"" he said, adding:    ""Nothing is really next for me. I'm going to remain part of ShapeShift and just be one leader among many.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING | AIRDROP,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/07/14/shapeshift-to-shut-down-airdrop-fox-tokens-to-decentralize-itself-out-of-existence,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dec108397f9ac2398299a4498363e8797b415fa2-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The digital asset manager launchedhttps://trusts.valkyrieinvest.com/algorand-trust its first Algorand Trust on Wednesday. Valkyrie also plans to stake the asset through Coinbase Custody, allowing it to offer a 4%-6% yield on top of exposure to ALGO within a few months, Steven McClurg, Valkyrie’s chief investment officer, said in an interview.    While Valkyrie follows Osprey Funds in offering an Algorand trust, it’s the only asset manager that offers staking within the trust, McClurg said. In April, both Valkyrie and Osprey launched Polkadot funds.      “We will have a few other trusts in the future that do proof-of-stake staking,” McClurg said, adding:    “We have to make sure that the process in which we stake doesn’t violate any type of grantor trust rules. … We’ve figured everything out, and now we just have to implement it from the technology side, which that’s why I say it’s probably another 30 or 60 days before we begin staking.”    Shares of the Aglorand Trust can be redeemed in seven days, slower than the company’s 24-hour redemption process for its Bitcoin Trust and faster than the 30 days needed for its Polkadot Trust.

42434825,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtkhh,1626271294,Bitcoin Mining Firm Compass Inks Deal With Nuclear Microreactor Company Oklo,"Nuclear-powered bitcoin mining appears to be gaining steam.      Compass Mining has signed a 20-year deal with nuclear fission startup Oklo under which Oklo will supply the bitcoin mining and hosting company with 150 megawatts of energy.      The first Oklo reactors will be deployed in 2023 or 2024 and the costs will be “considerably” less than the energy sources Compass plugs into now, Compass CEO Whit Gibbs said. Oklo plans to build mini-nuclear reactors that produce between one and 10 megawatts of electrical energy compared with the hundreds of megawatts produced at conventional reactors.      Oklo has applied for a 1.5-megawatt plant at the Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls and is working on additional applications.      Nuclear energy is increasingly part of the conversation when it comes to energy sources for bitcoin mining. Mining firms and their vast racks of power-hungry specialized computers have drawn the ire of environmental groups as bitcoin has surged in price in the last year.      Earlier this week, nuclear power company Energy Harbor Corp. signed a five-year partnership with Standard Power to fuel bitcoin mining in Ohio. Talen Energy announced plans to attach a bitcoin mining operation to a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania that it already owns and operates.    Read more: Volcano-Powered Bitcoin Mining Goes From Twitter Idea to State Policy in El Salvador    Compass is also in talks with Miami about getting power from the Turkey Point Nuclear Plant in Homestead, Fla., according to Gibbs. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez is said to be offering the plant to crypto mining firms as an inexpensive power source.    Decentralizing power    Compass allows individual miners to shop for a hosting facility and operates their mining hardware for them. In that sense, it operates as the Airbnb for facilities that host mining hardware. Gibbs said Compass aims to have as much of its mining network on carbon-free energy as possible.    Compass has distributed 0.5% of bitcoin’s hashrate into the hands of individual nodeshttps://nodes.com/ around the world and plans to capture 10% by the end of 2022, Gibbs said.    Compass now uses third-party facilities that hold power-purchase agreements and can dictate power prices.      “While the facility's power cost might be $0.030-0.035/kWh (kilowatt hours), they sell to Compass customers for $0.055-0.065/kWh,” Gibbs explained.      With Oklo, however, Compass holds the power-purchase agreement, and Gibbs said he expects power costs to be between $0.02-0.04/kWh.    Oklo’s view    As Compass takes advantage of cheaper energy, Oklo gains a partner that can take up extra energy supply at various reactors, said Oklo CEO Jacob DeWitte. Oklo could eventually build reactors that are solely dedicated to bitcoin mining.      This is the first cryptocurrency company that Oklo has gained as a customer and the first nuclear energy deal that Compass has secured. The deal could serve as a “beacon” for the future intersection of cryptocurrency and clean-energy development, DeWitte added.    See also: The Great Western Hashrate Migration Is Real    Unlike other commodities, bitcoin doesn’t require a great deal of infrastructure. Once the bitcoin is mined, the commodity can be instantly transported with no shipping costs.      “As demand might change by a few megawatts here and there, you can put that off into bitcoin mining,” DeWitte said.      Working with several microreactors as opposed to one large reactor also fits more neatly into the bitcoin ethos of decentralization, DeWitte added.    Is nuclear energy the future of bitcoin?    Oklo’sbusiness model aims to buck the traditional economies of scale that conventional nuclear reactors have taken advantage of by building larger reactors over time versus smaller ones.      DeWitte said he believes nuclear fission has the potential to be the cheapest source of alternative energy, despite the complexity and high costs of building conventional reactors.      “When you think about it from cost and sustainability purposes, looking at all the tools at our disposal to make energy, fission requires the least materials over its lifecycle,” he said.      There are some physicists who disagree with him.      Traditional nuclear plants typically cost billions to build, and while smaller reactors cost less to build, they tend to be proportionally more expensive, said M. V. Ramana, a physicist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. A $15 billion reactor might produce 1,000 megawatts, but building a reactor that produces 1 megawatt won’t be a thousandth of the cost of $15 billion, he added.      The costs associated with nuclear energy also pale in comparison with the declining costs of renewable sources of energy such as solar and wind, which are set to become cheaper over the next decade, Ramana said.      “The cost of generating nuclear electricity today is roughly about four times the cost of generating solar or wind power,” Ramana said.      Costs increase over time for large and small plants, Ramana said. Nuclear energy company NuScale Power, which builds reactors that produce about 60 megawatts of power, saw its costs increase significantly after it went through the regulatory process with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Ramana said.    Read more: A Russian Nuclear Plant Is Renting Space to Energy-Hungry Bitcoin Miners    It’s unlikely that Oklo would be approved to build by 2023 because its safety standards are unorthodox, said Edwin Lyman, a physicist with the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington.      “The mindset of Oklo and some of these other new reactor companies is they just want the NRC to accept the reactor is going to be safer, essentially let them do whatever they want,” Lyman said.      DeWitte noted that Oklo has been accepted into the NRC’s review process, which “represents a high bar and therefore is a major step of itself.” Compass’ Gibbs said he sees a recent $2 million award from the Department of Energy as validation that Oklo will be able to build its microreactors on time.

42434830,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPtkth,1626267624,Anheuser-Busch InBev Taps Vaynerchuk to Lead Beer Giant's 'Long-Term' NFT Play,"A non-fungible token of Bud Light’s blue knight yelling “Dilly Dilly”? Maybe so. The beer king’s parent company is about to go big on NFTs.      Anheuser-Busch InBev is planning a major ramp-up of its NFT crossover content, Richard Oppy, the company's vice president of global brands, told CoinDesk. He said the Budweiser brand is investing in a new NFT media shop run by internet entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk called VaynerNFT. Budweiser will also become its first client, Oppy said.      Described as a “long-term business play” by beer company executives, the tie-up puts everything from ticketing to merchandise on the table for NFTs from the multinational suds conglomerate.      At the start, the action will focus on intellectual property held by Budweiser, the world’s most valuable beer brand at $14 billion in 2020, according to Statista.      Budweiser’s breadth “gave us an opportunity, we thought, to go big into” NFTs, Oppy said, “because we don't think that this is just a fad. We think that this is going to change the way people think about their sponsorship properties in the future.”    Success with Stella    Anheuser-Busch InBev has already had some success with NFTs with its Stella Artois brand. In the last few months, that label has held a handful of niche NFT charity auctions and signed onto some notable projects, such as a digital auction of horse-racing NFTs through Ethereum-based horse racing platform ZED RUN.      “We sold over a million dollars’ worth of virtual horses,” Oppy said.      But the Budweiser playbook will go far deeper. Vaynerchuk, a communications executive at his media shop VaynerX, said he’s working with AB InBev’s marketing team to think of ways to put Bud properties to work.      In an interview with CoinDesk, Oppy and Vaynerchuk highlighted experiential NFTs as one potential focus area. That could mean offering NFT-holding sports and music fans access to their stars they couldn’t get elsewhere.      A marketing team is creating new NFTs, and Oppy named a few they have already forged including digital tokens for such items as collectibles, memorabilia, apparel, merchandise, limited-edition packaging, experiences, Super Bowl tickets and sideline spots at the World Cup.      “You can take it even further than that, like imagine if you had an NFT that allowed you to get beer, a fresh beer from any of our breweries around the world,” he said.      He said a marketing team will pitch more ideas later this week.    Driving revenue    With more than 500 brands and a marketing budget that in 2019 eclipsed $1.5 billion, according to Statisia, AB InBev has plenty of intellectual property to work its NFTs into.      “We already pay for” well-known assets and sponsorships, Oppy said. “It’s all about rethinking how we utilize them.”      Vaynerchuk said NFTs could drive long-term revenue for Budweiser by capturing a slice of the secondary market. Digital ticket stubs could one day be big money, he said. Smart contracts that activate whenever a digital ticket changes hands would allow Budweiser to tap into that cash stream.      Tickets in particular are closely intertwined with the beer behemoth. Budweiser pledged to give away 100,000 sports tickets in April.      “I think all the ticketing that we're involved with around the world, You know, they're all going to be NFTs in the future,” Oppy said. He said Budweiser would play an important educational role in helping customers navigate the technology of that.      “We're already rethinking some of the way we structure our deals, whether it's with our celebrities, whether it's the music space,” Oppy said.      Vaynerchuk said the tie-up will begin yielding public projects in the second half of 2021.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/07/14/anheuser-busch-inbev-taps-vaynerchuk-to-lead-beer-giants-long-term-nft-play,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e4435178211b05db7c9a49122ddffc677e9ec745-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The ECB decided to start the investigation phase of a eurozone central bank digital currency (CBDC), which will last 24 months, an announcement Wednesday said.  The ECB has been discussing the potential launch of a CBDC for the 19 euro countries since the beginning of this year.

Key to defending Ethereum against these MEV forces is the upcoming transition to Eth 2.0 and proof-of-stake (PoS). But will the transition come soon enough?    This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk's weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  Pulse check  Read more: Ethereum 2.0 Explained in 4 Easy Metrics    Bitcoin dominance tends to fall every crypto bull market cycle. As background, BTC dominance is a metric tracking the percentage of total cryptocurrency market capitalization made up by BTC.      During the most recent bull market cycle, BTC dominance dropped from roughly 70% in January to as low as 40% in May. While the volatile crypto markets have since turned bearish over the latter half of Q2 2021, causing BTC dominance to pick back up again, the metric continues to trend between the range of 40% and 50%.      Among the alternative cryptocurrencies eating up the market share of BTC, the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, ether, is the next largest coin, making up roughly 18% of total crypto market share. While ETH is the second-largest cryptocurrency next to BTC and has been since as early as 2016, it is not the fastest-growing altcoin on the market.      In 2021 Q2, the fastest-growing altcoin, excluding stablecoins, by monthly market cap growth, was the native token of Chiliz, a blockchain services network for sports and entertainment providers.      The chiliz token (CHZ) is the exclusive marketplace currency on Socios.com. Socios.com aims at decentralizing fanbase interaction with sports teams by leveraging blockchain infrastructure to facilitate payments for team merchandise, voting rights and other rewards. The marketplace has partnered with over 20 sporting and esports organizations including FC Barcelona, Juventus and Atletico de Madrid.      Fans for each of these teams can purchase branded “Fan Tokens” on Socios.com that allow them to vote on certain team decisions such as renaming facilities or changing entrance songs. Since the CHZ is the exclusive means of exchange in the marketplace, the token accrues in value alongside demand for voting rights and rewards provided by the entertainers on the Socios.com platform.      The sports industry alone has a yearly value in the hundreds of billions of dollars and could gain further value through strong customer loyalty programs like the ones being experimented on through CHZ and Socios.com. The Chiliz token is one way to speculate on the use of Ethereum-based tokens for fan engagement and the continued growth of the Socios.com marketplace as the main platform to do this.      Teddy Oosterbaan    New frontiers: Does Ethereum need a stronger defense against MEV?    Block subsidies, transaction fees and miner/maximal extractable value (MEV): These are the three main revenue streams of Ethereum miners.      In efforts to combat currency inflation, protocol developers lowered block subsidies from 5 ETH to 3 ETH in 2017, and again from 3 ETH to 2 ETH in 2019. Starting in August 2021, transaction fees are also expected to decline as a result of Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559 and its fee-burning mechanism. The only revenue stream that is expected to grow larger and more lucrative for miners in the months to come is MEV.    Read more: Valid Points: MEV on Eth 2.0: The Good, Bad and Ugly    MEV refers to the income a miner receives as a direct result of their ability to insert, leave out and reorder transactions within a block. The order of transactions is of utmost importance in the context of high-frequency trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) where automated bots can identify buy or sell orders waiting for execution on Ethereum and front-run these trades before they get executed.      The higher the liquidity and value being moved on-chain through these DEXs, the greater the profit opportunity for miners to earn additional income through MEV.      *Missing values for daily extracted MEV appear in this chart as interpolated dotted lines that connects the plot points immediately preceding and succeeding the missing value      The larger MEV rewards become in comparison to block subsidies and transaction fees, the greater the financial incentive for miners to adjust not only the order of transactions but also the order of blocks themselves. In what is known as a “time bandit” attack, miners may begin to identify MEV opportunities in blocks that have already been finalized and reorganize the blockchain in their favor if potential rewards from frontrunning are larger than earnings from honest mining (i.e., block subsidies and transaction fees).      Speaking to the potential for miners to reorganize Ethereum blocks and disrupt chain finality, Georgios Konstantopoulos and Leo Zhang from Paradigm Research wrote in a blog post back in March, “This scenario is not obviously plausible: Miners are (for the most part) structurally long ETH, and such an action would directly negatively impact their ETH investment.”    Theory manifesting into reality    However, it would appear the tools for MEV extraction by way of block reorganization are actively being built and already being executed in primitive forms.      Edgar Aroutiounian of Flashbots tweeted on Thursday, July 8, that he had created a personal GitHub repository codifying how payments to miners can be facilitated in exchange for destabilizing blockchain consensus. Shortly thereafter, on Saturday, July 10, Twitter user “0xbunnygirl” announced their own code repository for MEV extraction through block reorgs called “Request for Reorg.”      While the possibility of MEV negatively impacting chain finality and immutability has been a long-running concern, discussed as early as November 2020 among Ethereum researchers, the reality of this happening appears to be manifesting today.      In light of this reality, there are a handful of defense mechanisms that researchers insist will protect the integrity of Ethereum’s blockchain. First, there is the collective will of the Ethereum community to censor this kind of behavior. Users can leave mining pools that are using their computational power, also called hashrate, to reorg blocks. Honest miners can resist accepting blocks they know to be from hostile miners engaging in these MEV practices.      Second, there is the forthcoming upgrade to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol with Eth 2.0, after which miners will no longer have the ability to propose blocks or reorder transactions within blocks. These two responsibilities will fall into the hands of validator node operators, who are required to own a large investment of ETH, worth roughly $63,600 or 32 ETH, and have skin in the game in order to participate in blockchain consensus.    Weak lines of defense    Neither of these two defenses is convincing. The former assumes the collective will of the community is homogeneous and aligned on resisting MEV extraction through block reorgs despite clear evidence to the contrary. For some, such as Aroutiounian, if block reorgs can be done on Ethereum and there is a clear financial incentive for them to happen, they should – regardless of how it impacts public perception of the network.      The upgrade to Eth 2.0 and PoS as a defense against block reorgs for MEV extraction does not address the present reality and the impact these events can have on the value of Ethereum in the interim before the upgrade is ready for deployment. The readiness checklist which outlines all the tasks needed for PoS activation remains in large part unfinished. The earliest that developers estimate Ethereum’s transition to PoS will happen is the beginning of 2022.      Ethereum needs a stronger line of defense to combat the reality of MEV extraction through block reorgs.

TAKEAWAY: Polygon’s DEX trading volume and liquidity came and went with a spike in rewards during the month of June, while remaining comparatively more stable on Ethereum over the same time period.

In today’s low or negative interest rate environment, the bank wrote in a blog post, digital assets offer an alternative to yield generation. (Article, Yahoo)  Gas prices on Ethereum have been on a downward trend since late April, dropping from roughly 150 gwei to 15 gwei. TAKEAWAY: A higher block capacity, the rising popularity of layer 2 scaling solutions and increased use of alternative payment channels between DEX traders and miners are all likely factors contributing to lower gas prices on Ethereum. (Newsletter issue, Coin Metrics)  Circle, the co-creator of dollar-backed stablecoin USDC, is set to go public at a $4.5 billion valuation. TAKEAWAY: USDC is the second-largest stablecoin on Ethereum by circulating supply next to tether. In a presentation on Circle’s plans to go public, the company predicted sevenfold growth in USDC’s market capitalization by 2023. The predicted circulating supply would be $190 billion, much higher than leading stablecoin, USDT, which currently is sitting around $63 billion. (Article, CoinDesk)  Weekly volumes in dollar markets for BTC and ETH reached new all-time highs in 2021 Q2. Notably, notional volumes in ether-dollar pairs consistently surpassed bitcoin pairs for the first time ever in the month of May. TAKEAWAY: Surging interest in NFTs and DeFi since the beginning of this year are likely factors contributing to the growth of ether trading volumes.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and other relevant bodies should issue appropriate guidelines for crypto exchanges advertising on TV, the court said, according to reports Wednesday.  The court is seeking responses from SEBI, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and some of India's prominent crypto exchanges like WasirX, scheduling the matter for discussion in August.  The request comes after lawyers Ayush Shukla and Vikash Kumar petitioned for SEBI to mandate disclaimer text covering 80% of the screen, with a voiceover reading slowly for five seconds.  The suggested format compares with the current practice where a disclaimer is displayed briefly in small text with wording such as ""Cryptocurrency is an unregulated digital currency, not a legal tender and subject to market risks,"" according to the request.  If the guidelines are issued, it might be interpreted as a further sign of India moving away from the outright crypto ban that had been threatened by the government and adopting a more lenient approach by regulating the industry.

Out of China's 34 provinces and province-level cities, 33 have enacted policies to accelerate blockchain innovation, local media reported, citing research from Chinese blockchain news site ChainNews.  The newest issue of China's most important economic-planning document, the Five-Year Plan, named blockchain a nationally strategic technology for the first time, calling on local governments to spur innovation in the field.  Fourteen governments are offering financial rewards to companies that excel in blockchain innovation.  Ganzhou, a city in one of China's poorest provinces, Jiangxi, is promising 17.5 million yuan ($2.7 million) to companies that become unicorns, according to the report. A unicorn company is commonly defined as a startup whose valuation reaches $1 billion.  Shanghai is offering permanent residency to highly skilled workers who move there to work on blockchain, the report said. Permanent residency in Shanghai is a lifetime aspiration for many Chinese citizens because it allows them to live, buy property and access public services in the country's most international city.

The leading cryptocurrency was trading near $32,300 at press time, a 1.4% drop on the day. Prices hit a 2 1/2-week low of $31,669 early today, having run into offers above $33,000 on Tuesday, CoinDesk 20 data show.      The drop to the lowest level since June 26 comes a day after futures tied to the federal funds rate and eurodollars, which track short-term interest-rate expectations, raised bets on Tuesday that the Fed would increase interest rates between December 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. According to Reuters, the repricing happened after the U.S. Labor Department said the consumer price index increased 5.4% year-over-year in June, the fastest pace since 2008.      Rate hikes, or possible tapering as signaled by Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard, boost the attractiveness of holding fiat currencies, in this case the dollar, and dilute the appeal of perceived store-of-value assets such as bitcoin and gold.      However, while bitcoin is nursing losses, gold is trading 0.35% higher on the day at $1,814 an ounce. The discrepancy spurred Amber Group, a crypto services provider, to call for caution in reading too much into the rate-hike narrative for the time being.      ""Bitcoin's weakness this morning could be associated with the Fed rate-hike fears,"" Amber Group said. ""However, it's hard to force this rate-hike narrative as a headwind if other risk assets (stocks) are hitting new highs and gold remains bid.""      Trader and analyst Alex Kruger said the cryptocurrency has been looking heavy for a long time, courtesy of weak flows, and ""the CPI may have helped.""      That said, some analysts say concerns over tightening or gradual unwinding of stimulus may not be a threat to traditional markets, but present immediate downside risk to bitcoin.      ""Is tapering a real concern? Not for broad markets, but arguably it is a risk for bitcoin, considered by fiat-based institutional investors at the extreme end of the risk spectrum,"" Messari's Mira Christanto said in a blog post dated May 27. ""Capital to this new asset class is still mercenary and tends to over-react on the bull and bear side.""      The mid-May sell-off from $58,000 to $30,000 occurred after a reported surge in U.S. inflation in April increased concerns that the Fed may consider an early rate increase or reduction of liquidity-boosting asset purchases, known as quantitative easing.      Stack Funds Chief Operations Officer Matthew Dibb said, ""The recent increase in Fed rate-hike bets may not bode well for BTC in the short term, as the recent correlation is more tied to equities, liquidity and retail sentiment, rather than BTC being a 'hedge' to inflation.""      Dibb said the cryptocurrency has been looking weak on technical charts for the past few weeks, and the latest U.S. CPI release may add to the selling pressure.      However, while bitcoin has come under pressure this week, it is still locked in the broad two-month range of $30,000 to $40,000. ""It's hard to read too much into the price action currently while we're still stuck in this range,"" Amber Group said.

42387245,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmCbf,1626254683,3 More Chinese Provinces Shutter Crypto Mines as Clampdown Continues,"Three provinces in China have joined a growing list of jurisdictions in the country that have ordered a halt to crypto mining amid a nationwide crackdown on the industry.      Heifi Online, a Chinese state-owned website in Anhui, reported Wednesday that the province will ""clean up and shut down"" crypto mines to avoid an imminent power shortage.      Also on Wednesday, Chinese journalist Colin Wu reported that the provincial departments of China's State Grid Corp. in Henan and Gansu will shutter local mining industries in those provinces.      The two provincial State Grid departments are implementing a decision that the state-owned enterprise made late last month, Wu told CoinDesk on Wednesday. The notice by State Grid's headquarters calls on provinces to ""clean up and crack down"" on crypto mines that are using up electricity from the national grid.      More provinces are expected to follow suit, Wu wrote.      Gansu province is in West China, bordering Xinjiang, Qinghai, Sichuan and Inner Mongolia. It accounted for 2% the country's hashrate between September 2019 and April 2020, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index.      China's National Energy Administration has warned that Anhui's electricity demand will exceed its supply starting in 2022, Hefei Online wrote.      Henan and Anhui are landlocked provinces in eastern China.      At a May meeting of China's State Council, ministers discussed a crackdown on crypto mines. Provinces, prefectures and cities have moved against the industry since. Qinghai, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and Sichuan announced they are either cleaning up or shutting down mining.      The concern is partly environmental and partly financial. China is gearing up to achieve ambitious carbon neutrality goals set in its five-year plan in March, while regulators are concerned about crypto's impact on financial stability.      In response, mining firms are starting to move their rigs overseas.

42387241,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBmCXt,1626241873,Q2 Revenue Surges at  Travel Booking Platform Travala,"Binance-backed travel website Travala's Q2 revenue rose 141% over the previous three months amid a rebound in global travel, the company said in a report.      The London-based company generated $9.8 million in revenue from April to June, which was also a whopping increase from the $274,718 it generated in the same period last year when the coronavirus pandemic kept people home. In the Q2 report, Travala also attributed the strong performance to ""strategic initiatives, optimisations and partnerships"" that have broadened its offerings and improved service.      The Q2 result also signaled a wider embrace of the company's blockchain-based travel booking platform after Travala generated only $249,365 in revenue for Q2 2019, a year prior to the pandemic's onset. Co-founder and CEO Juan Otero told CoinDesk in an email that he was heartened by the improvement and expects 2021 revenue to be seven to eight times higher than last year's.      Travala, which accepts over 40 cryptocurrencies, Binance Pay and fiat payment forms, allows guests to purchase hotel stays, flights and experiences directly through its platform. According to data from Travala, crypto purchases account for approximately 70% of the platform’s business.      “Travala.com has been through some challenging times,” Otero said in a written response to CoinDesk questions. ”Now we are starting to see travel rebound and all the hard work we’ve done is starting to pay off. We’re extremely optimistic about travel coming back stronger than ever.”      While hotels account for the largest share of Travala’s revenue, it expanded its flight offerings following a merger with competitor TravelbyBit in May 2020. An existing partnership with tour and activity provider Viator is expected to help Travala increase its revenue.      Otero said Travala plans to find new partners within the crypto industry and traditional travel sector as part of wider expansion plans. Travala is also developing a concierge service that will cater to crypto-VIP and corporate clients looking for crypto-paid luxury travel experiences.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | BNB,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/14/q2-revenue-surges-at-travel-booking-platform-travala,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4ea6863b126a15e242e884512e6c13e2a36a7551-2210x1164.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The bill would also regulate crypto mining as well as trading through exchanges and peer-to-peer marketplaces where participants will be required to register as ""obligated subjects,"" according to Decrypt's reporting.      It's a stark contrast to neighboring Latin American country El Salvador, which last month approved its own version of a Bitcoin Law designed to make the crypto legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar.      Specifically, the rationale of the bill states that crypto mining should be seen as an industrial activity under the purview of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce because of its use of capital, labor, machinery and construction of civil infrastructure.

Global payments giant Visa has approved local Australian startup CryptoSpend to begin issuing debit cards for the startup's users. Those using the CryptoSpend app can then pay using their bitcoin and other supported crypto at retail stores and hospitality venues.      Instead of needing to convert from crypto to fiat, like some other offerings on the market, users of CryptoSpend's app can make direct purchases.      CryptoSpend co-founder Andrew Grech told CoinDesk via email CryptoSpend's card will give Australians another ""flexible way"" to spend their crypto on everyday items.      ""Anything from a cinema ticket to your new pair of headphones,"" said Grech.      ASX-listed Novatti will issue the card, which is expected to hit Australia in September, while custody of the crypto holdings will be handed over to New York-licensed custodian BitGo, AFR reported.      CryptoSpend's app allows users to spend their crypto, pay out to their account, and pay bills with supported cryptos including bitcoin, ether, XRP, bitcoin cash and litecoin. The app has its own wallet on which users can hold their coins.      ""We have customers that range from 18-year-old students to 70-year-old grandmothers, said Richard Voice, co-founder & COO of CryptoSpend. ""[This] further emphasizes the growing appetite for people of all ages to use crypto as an everyday currency.""

The ""move marks the first step for DeFi applications (dapps) to rival and surpass traditional web user experiences,"" the startup said in a blog post on Tuesday.      DeFi exchange Uniswap's transactions are conducted on Ethereum and accompanying gas fees which have, at times this year, reached unsustainable highs. Solutions such as Optimism's seek to reduce costs associated.      During the Alpha period, OΞ will support an initial throughput of 0.6 transactions per second, the startup said in its post.      As a result of Uniswap's third iteration, known as version 3 (v3), and being one of the few protocols deployed on the startup's mainnet, transaction capacity should be in line with layer one (L1) results.      Unlike L1 though, transactions on OΞ should be confirmed instantaneously, the startup said.
