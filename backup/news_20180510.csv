42401510,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczuKb,1525982401,Ripple: XRP Pilot Cuts Payment Fees Up to 70%,"Distributed ledger startup Ripple published the results of its xRapid pilot programs on Thursday,  The report focused on the company's offering centered around the cryptocurrency XRP, stating that pilot-takers saw significant savings on fees as well as overall transaction times. The company has announced a number of partnerships in recent months with companies piloting xRapid as well as xCurrent, another offering that does not utilize XRP.  Head of product Asheesh Birla told CoinDesk that the company looked at seven pilot projects, finding that the results were fairly similar across the board. As a result, the startup aggregated the data into the 40-70 percent savings released in its report on Thursday. He also noted that transactions across borders only took a few minutes, compared to a period of several days for traditional payments of that kind.  The platforms piloting xRapid recognized that speed, he said, adding ""they were like, ‘Wow, this entire thing is happening in a matter of seconds all the way through,’ and that’s just not possible given the way the current legacy financial system works.”  While the transactions from one financial institution to another took a few minutes, the portion actually involving the XRP ledger only took a few seconds, Birla said. The bulk of the time spent was caused by the institutions converting fiat to XRP and back through local exchanges.  ""It takes a few minutes to process and send out into local rails,"" he said.  Now Ripple plans to focus on moving from pilot programs to full-scale launches, he said, though there is no firm timeline yet for those plans.  ""We’re going to continue running pilots and we’re working on putting the final touches on the product. The next step now is moving those customers from pilot to production,"" Birla explained, adding:  ""With financial products and payments, there is no Silicon Valley ‘move fast and break things,’ we really have to make sure we’re buttoned up from security standpoint, from the compliance standpoint.”  XRP token image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,XRP,FIAT | WALLET | XRP,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/05/10/ripple-xrp-pilot-cuts-payment-fees-up-to-70,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b0b1c015c3f801e311385f55b2fa8a32b0309b41-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42401509,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczuLa,1525977940,Walmart Patent Envisions Blockchain-Powered Delivery Fleets,"Automated delivery cars or trucks connected via blockchain could one day deliver packages for Walmart, new patent filings suggest.  The retail giant hinted at the possible use case in an application filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) back in October and published Thursday. Per the documents, the patent centers around technology tools to secure ""restricted access areas"" at a customer's home that would receive packages from the autonomous ground vehicles (AVGs), as Walmart calls them.  Much of the application itself doesn't mention the technology, but at one point, Walmart mentions how blockchain could serve as part of a solution for ""authentication-based access and encryption"" that would allow the vehicles to access those restricted areas.  Additionally, that distributed network could serve as a way to track and authenticate the goods themselves.  As the application explains:  ""When a customer interacts with a product, the customer is permitted to do so via a private or public authentication key. In response, new blocks may be added to subsequent root blocks, which will contain information relating to the date and time a product delivered by the AGV was accessed, as well as the authentication key that accessed the product.""  Walmart wrote in the application that its proposed system could ""increase customer loyalty"" due to the ""significant convenience"" it would provide. Likewise, it added that the system would likely cut costs because of its automated nature – at the expense of delivery drivers who might otherwise serve in that capacity, however.  Indeed, the application further cements the impression that Wal-Mart is looking at blockchain as a possible tool for improving the automation of its services.  As CoinDesk reported in March, the retailer – which is separately researching blockchain as a means to track food shipments – filed a patent application aimed at creating a ""smart"" courier system.

42401516,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczuST,1525973456,Bitcoin Developers Build Prototype for 'Dandelion' Privacy Tool,"Developers hoping to bring a higher level of transaction anonymity to the bitcoin blockchain have built a prototype for their ""Dandelion"" privacy project.  The test, according to an email sent to the bitcoin development mailing list on Thursday, comes after the team behind the project added more theoretical analysis in a bid to address concerns that the initial Dandelion proposal may be exposed to a deanonymization attack.  A variety of projects have focused on this question within the bitcoin network, all of which seek to improve privacy for users of the public – and pseudonymous – blockchain. As previously reported by CoinDesk, the Dandelion Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) was first published in June of last year, led by Giulia Fanti, an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University and backed by Zcash advisor and University of Illinois assistant professor Andrew Miller, and several other faculty members and students from the school.  The proposal initially aimed to introduce a two-phase route for bitcoin transactions: ""stem,"" which is the transaction itself, and ""fluff,"" which is an obfuscation phase that would eventually obscure the original IP address of a bitcoin sender.  However, following the proposal's publication, Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell pointed out that the tech may run into deanonymization over time, which means attackers will still be able to identify the origin by cross-checking transaction patterns.  Yet in the latest update, the team behind the Dandelion project have suggested a ""per-inbound-edge,"" which essentially aims to ensure Dandelion transactions sent from one node will be routed in different paths in the network in order to block the identification of traceable data.  Subsequently, the team has built a prototype and moved to test the project on its own small network, finding that so far Dandelion is compatible with existing versions of bitcoin, the team said.  ""Dandelion does not conflict with existing versions of Bitcoin. A Bitcoin node that supports Dandelion appears no differently to Bitcoin nodes running older software versions. Bitcoin nodes that support Dandelion can identify feature support through a probe message,"" the team wrote in an implementation document.

The tune token, which RecordGram licenses, was created to ""solve digital songwriter rights and royalty transparency issues for the music industry,"" the website says.

Speaking from notes written on the back of a paper plate, he added:  ""We have never had a market mania led by retail before.""  But Novogratz came to talk about the move of institutional investors into cryptocurrency following last year's dramatic boom in prices. Novogratz started his remarks by mentioning his company's own big recent development, the launch of the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, which tracks the most liquid assets trading on blockchains.  ""I'm hoping yesterday marks the beginning of the institutionalization of crypto as an asset class,"" Novogratz said, because ""big problems need big capital.""  And Novogratz emphasized that he believes that crypto's big impacts will happen at the street-level, where regular people do things like rent rooms, ride cars and pay each other to do work.  ""The decentralized revolution is going to have its biggest impact in the retail sense,"" he said, but to get there it will take the investment power of the big institutions.  Describing recent meetings with staff at Deutsche Bank, the New York Stock Exchange and Goldman Sachs, Novogratz said he believes it is happening – and this year.  ""There are three superhighways that all of you need to follow,"" he advised the crowd of roughly 700 people.  First, computer science, where he said he tries his best to sit with his computer engineers and follow the technical underpinnings of the industry. He cited two immediate technical challenges, scaling and the proper balance between speed and security.  ""We have a bet on EOS because I think people like speed and convenience. We also have a bet on ethereum,"" because it has the most developers, he said. ""My intuition is: we don't need 100 blockchains.""  He also said his intuition tells him the problems of balancing security and network scaling will get solved.  Second, he pointed to token economics, saying: ""It's the coins that are exciting.""  Novogratz stated that investors haven't thought deeply enough about the new coins.  ""2018 is an important year because most of us as investors, myself included, didn't think enough about how do these tokens work? And why do they have value?"" he asked.  Typically, it's argued that if a protocol doesn't give reasons for buyers and sellers to hold onto a token, its value will drop to zero. Novogratz doesn't believe that's quite right though.  He argued that in, for example, a decentralized ridesharing protocol, a lot of riders and drivers will both hold onto a small amount of token as a speculative investment.  ""The token is a future on how many rides a token can get,"" he said. As the protocol grows, it will take less of a token to buy a ride and the value of coins will grow. ""Even though that's speculating on the future, it feels a lot like equity.""  Lastly, he mentioned institutional investors. ""The institutional herd is on the move,"" he said, adding that he prays every night that established players will get into the custody game to make it happen.  ""We need custody to hit the tipping point,"" he said, adding that the pension program of state employees in Wisconsin (for example) isn't going to be comfortable using a startup for custody.  ""There are three superhighways and the trucks are moving on all three superhighways,"" he told the crowd, concluding:  ""I'm more bullish this year than I was last year.""

While developers will determine the particular nature of their projects, the firm hopes the grants will encourage a variety of usable dapps oriented toward the preservation of digital rights, privacy and user choice.  ""We're really looking for the best teams to build applications on top of Blockstack that have the highest likelihood of getting widespread user adoption,"" the company's co-founder, Ryan Shea told CoinDesk in an interview.  Shea explained:  ""This is about bringing real value to end users. There is a lot of speculation in the space, there is a lot of talk and hype and not enough real things getting built that touch people's lives.""  The initiative, he said, was borne out of a desire to incentivize developers to build alternatives to major social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.  In the wake of incidents such as the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he said, ""We knew it was the right time for a lot of these social networks to gain traction.""  The company has specifically suggested that developers pursue features like uncensorable microblogs and community-curated blocklists among others. Likewise, it proposed that developers could create dapps targeted toward illness support groups, journalists and activists under authoritarian regimes, and LGBT communities, for example.  However, Shea said Blockstack doesn't intend for these ideas to ""confine people,"" but instead hopes they will provide a point of departure for further exploration.  Additionally, he suggested that the funding will act as a stepping stone for developer teams, helping them to subsist until they are able to raise venture capital.  The grants will be only one source of financing for developer teams. They will also have the option to build monetization into their dapps via a rewards system that is embedded in the Blockstack protocol.  ""Every single application that's built on Blockstack will be eligible for these rewards and they will be eligible proportional to their ratings,"" Shea explained.  He added that Blockstack's support for social network dapps will be ongoing, noting:  ""We really want to empower those teams.""

42401507,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczuHe,1525950059,'Ebay for CryptoKitties' Raises $2 Million from All-Star VCs,"More money is being poured into crypto cats.  Well, cats, and the slew of other non-fungible digital items made possible by new token standards, such as ethereum's ERC-721. And these crypto collectibles now have a home in OpenSea, a marketplace for allowing users to buy and sell these items – an Ebay for CryptoKitties if you will.  Coming out of Y-Combinator last winter, OpenSea today announced a $2 million seed equity round led by 1confirmation, with participation from a series of other high-profile crypto investors, including Founders Fund, Foundation Capital, Blockchain Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Chernin Group, Stable Fund and Blockstack.  ""When CryptoKitties came out, it was this exciting, mainstream, fun use case for blockchain,"" Devin Finzer, co-founder of OpenSea, told CoinDesk.  Indeed, the ethereum-based decentralized application for buying, selling and breeding digital cats was a quick hit within the community, launching in November last year and peaking in December, when the game nearly brought the ethereum blockchain to a halt as it tried to deal with a significant increase in transactions.  Many concluded that the game helped push blockchain technology and cryptocurrency into the mainstream, and others argued that the game displayed a blockchain use case that could expand away from silly cats and into serious business (such as real estate). For instance, Union Square Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz led a $12 million investment round to spin CrypoKitties out of its parent company so that the team could really dig deeper into future applications for the concept of non-fungible digital items.  And while those serious applications have yet to be realized, a spate of similar games were created after CryptoKitties success, including the more general CryptoPets, CryptoCelebrities and Crypto All-Stars.  But according to OpenSea, users need a place to more easily buy and sell those items.  It turns out OpenSea wasn't alone: the decentralized online marketplace for physical items OpenBazaar has plans to open up its platform for digital items such as CryptoKitties as well, plus OPSkins recently created Wax, a platform for spinning up decentralized exchange services for these items.  So far, it looks like a fine idea, according to Finzer, who said:  ""We've so far had about half a million [dollars] in volume pass through our marketplace.""  The go-to marketplace  One of the keys to OpenSea's success, according to Finzer, is the team's relationship with crypto game developers.  As to be expected, OpenSea has done best in offering a ""store"" for games that don't already have built-in marketplaces (many game developers want to focus on the game and so aren't keen to building a marketplace on top). As those game developers hear about OpenSea, they've typically just made OpenSea the game's official digital shop.  ""We've kind of developed a synergistic relationship with game developers,"" Finzer said, adding that OpenSea offers a revenue share model depending on what marketplace duties are handled by what party (although Finzer declined to discuss this in more detail).  Yet, OpenSea is available for more than just games, although that's the company's main stream of business. For instance, one art project used OpenSea and Finzer said it could also work as a marketplace for software licenses.  We've barely scratched the surface on what these crypto collectibles and a marketplace for them could offer.  One thing that's interesting about these programs, for instance, is that because a CryptoKitty, for example, is just a piece of code, different interfaces will create completely different visualizations of that cat (as recently displayed by a viral art image made purely from code).  These different visualizations could be shared between users and might make the games even more fun.  Zombies for kitties?  Plus, Finzer wants to facilitate the trade of items that aren't even part of the same game.  This would go above and beyond digital games today, where items that are part of a centralized game must stay within that universe, he said, adding:  ""I could be breeding zombies and you could be breeding kitties. I think what that results in is, these items having a lot more value than they would in the existing digital world.""  In fact, this kind of cross-collaboration has already happened – a new game called KittyRace allows users to race their CryptoKitties.  This kind of thing, Finzer said, has garnered quite a bit of interest from other crypto gaming companies.  This interest in digital items isn't new only to the world of cryptocurrency, though. In fact, the market for gold within the massively multiplayer online role-playing game World of Warcraft is so lucrative that prisoners in China are made to mine the stuff for sale to gamers in the developed world.  Yet, Finzer said, he plans to stay out of the world of trading digital items for physical cash, namely because it's a business that's somewhat frowned upon, but also because he doesn't see a lot of opportunity in enticing more traditional gaming companies to move to a blockchain.  ""The technological benefits of moving an existing game to a blockchain are actually negative now,"" he said.  That doesn't get Finzer down, though. He sees tremendous opportunity focused on crypto.  He concluded:  ""Our thesis is that the most interesting use cases for blockchain-based games will come from new games rather than existing games.""

The offering, which is limited to accredited investors, will start on May 21 and seek to raise up to $50 million, WENN Digital announced on Thursday. Kodak licensed its brand to the firm for the project, which involves a digital rights management platform that has its own built-in cryptocurrency.  KODAKCoin and its planned sale were first revealed in January, but an expected start date of Jan. 31 was delayed for what was originally said to be a several-week period.  The SAFTs are being sold at $1 apiece, according to WENN. The company's intention to sell SAFTs rather than tokens directly was revealed in a paper published back in March.  As explained in a previous CoinDesk feature, SAFTs are investment contracts designed to be sold to accredited investors as a means of funding development, similar to the way equity changes hands in traditional venture capital. In a SAFT sale, no tokens are offered, sold or exchanged – instead money is exchanged for paper documents that promise access to a future product.  WENN said the sale will be conducted through a platform called Cointopia and that it will be managed by Pickwick Capital Partners and Exemplar Capital.  “We are excited to offer the SAFTs and the rights to the underlying KODAKCoin in a manner structured to fully comply with an exemption to the SEC’s registration requirements,” said Jan Denecke, WENN's CEO, adding:  “Our goal with this offering is utmost security and transparency, working to bring digital tokens to investors by adhering to industry best practices and in a manner that we hope instills public confidence in the crypto space.”  The sale announcement comes days after a cryptocurrency exchange claimed that it was hosting the KODAKCoin ICO, an assertion that a representative for KODAKCoin called ""fraudulent.""

The DHA proposed the framework during a joint standing committee on trade growth on Thursday, a ZDNet report says.

42401522,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczuYN,1525942819,Bear Mood? $9K Still in Play Despite Bitcoin Rally,"Despite a brief rally yesterday, bitcoin (BTC) is still in corrective mode and risks falling back below $9,000, chart analysis suggests.  The cryptocurrency broke out of the bearish falling channel setup Wednesday, courtesy of a bullish relative strength index (RSI) divergence – indicating the pullback from the recent high of $9,990 had ended at a low of $8,980.  The breakout also raised the prospects of a stronger move towards $9,767 (April 25 high) and possibly even the $10,000 mark.  However, the ascent has been cut short around $9,380 in the last 15 hours, as seen in the hourly chart below.  Hourly chart  As of writing, bitcoin is attempting a break above $9,380 on Bitfinex, above which a major resistance is seen at $9,442 – the 200-hour moving average (MA). Meanwhile, a strong support is seen at $9,228 (marked by a circle).  The momentum studies are biased bearish. For instance, the 100-hour MA is trending south in favor of the bears and the 50-hour MA is still gradually descending (yet to bottom out or shed bearish bias).  As a result, a convincing move above $9,442 could be a tough task.  Further, the short-term moving averages in the daily chart have rolled over in favor of the bears.  Daily chart  The bearish crossover between the 5-day MA and the 10-day MA indicates a short-term (5 days) bullish-to-bearish trend change. It also indicates the pullback from the recent high of $9,990 has not run its course.  View  A break below $9,228 (support on the hourly chart) would add credence to the bearish 5-day MA and 10-day MA crossover and open the doors for a drop to $8,980 and $8,868 (100-day moving average).  A daily close (as per UTC) below $8,652 (April 26 low) would confirm a bearish reversal.  On the higher side, a daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA (currently located at $9,452) would signal the end of the pullback from the recent high of $9,990.

The blockchain wing of Morgan Creek Capital Management, an investment advisor, announced Wednesday that it is working with Anexio Technology Services to convert all of its physical shares into an ERC-20 token. The ERC-20 standard allows for the creation of tokens on the ethereum network.  The company plans to raise $40 million by selling the tokens to accredited investors.  Morgan Creek chief investment officer Mark Yusko told CoinDesk that the investment firm partnered with Anexio because it was confident in the firm's economic position, noting that it “is one of the 500 fastest-growing companies in the U.S.”  On its own, Anexio already qualified for financing through a bank, he said, which “gives a sense of the financial health of the business.” The company produces graphical processing units (GPUs) and will expand its production capabilities with the funds it expects to raise.  Anthony Pompliano, a partner with Morgan Creek Blockchain, explained that tokenizing Anexio’s shares allowed it to raise funds from a broader group of people, telling CoinDesk:  ""By tokenizing the business, we took the cap table, the paper shares - every company in the world has paper share certificates - and we tokenized it. We swapped, one for one, the paper shares for tokens, which allow for a global investor base and trades on a security exchange.""

42401514,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAczuPW,1525923577,JP Morgan's New DLT Lead: We're Not Done With Blockchain Innovation,"As JP Morgan Chase's new blockchain lead, Christine Moy has big shoes to fill. And a quandary to resolve.  Moy took over last month from Amber Baldet, one of the most prominent figures in blockchain, after she left to form an as-yet-unnamed startup. Around the same time Baldet announced her departure, word leaked out that JP Morgan was considering a spin-out of Quorum, the ethereum-based, open-source project that had been the cornerstone of the bank’s blockchain work.  To be clear, those deliberations do not mean Quorum is struggling – big corporates like JP Morgan tend to shelve failing projects, not spin them out into funded entities.  Indeed, it could be argued that Quorum may have become a victim of its own success. There are more than 20 organizations within the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance working group looking to build on top of the platform.  But for JP Morgan, the challenge is about allowing Quorum to flourish independently, in true open-source protocol style. Perhaps private blockchains, like their public counterparts, face difficult governance problems, too – especially once they start to gather a network effect.  Yet in an interview this week, Moy was quick to emphasize that the recent speculation around Quorum does not capture the breadth of JP Morgan's work in distributed ledger technology (DLT).  She told CoinDesk:  “That's not the most exciting part about our team's agenda; it's part of the story but it's not, like, the story.”  And it's true that JP Morgan is involved in a number of important blockchain projects that are separate from Quorum, such as its collaborations with Digital Asset Holdings, Axoni and Nivaura. Nevertheless, the fate of Quorum is the elephant in the room that will have to be addressed.  Fortunately for JP Morgan, in Moy it has a leader who not only knows that project inside and out but is all too familiar with the reasons the bank started exploring the tech to begin with.  Cross-trained for blockchain  Moy, the new program lead for the Blockchain Centre of Excellence (BCOE) at JP Morgan, brings to the role firsthand knowledge of exactly the kind of problems that distributed ledger technology aims to solve.  She started her career in the middle office of JP Morgan's syndicated loans business. In this job, Moy had to deal with all the documents that needed to be signed before these transactions could close. Even more antiquated than most corners of legacy finance, syndicated loans can take 20 days to settle.  “I used to be the person that faxed those documents around to settle those trades, so I know that process intimately,” Moy said.  She then spent over a decade working across a range of assets and divisions at the bank. This cross-training included witnessing how securities and chains of custody were frozen solid as the 2008 crash engulfed the entire financial system.  That experience underscored for her the importance of a transparent system of reconciliation – just as the syndicated loans role drove home the need for faster settlements.  With that pedigree and perspective, Moy was a natural for the BCOE, where she was Baldet’s first hire.  Yet perhaps most importantly, working in various parts of a sprawling, diversified company – one assembled from decades of mergers – has shaped Moy’s thinking about one of the key challenges for DLT, particularly the private kind: interoperability.  “It doesn’t make sense to design blockchains to reflect the siloed operating models existing today,” she told CoinDesk, adding:  “Creating a fragmentation of small blockchain networks, without figuring out a way to enable interoperability or connectivity, is likely not the promised path to the cost savings and operational efficiency that enterprises are looking for.”  Open source, open mind  This, of course, brings up another delicate subject for a bank, particularly one whose CEO has famously bashed bitcoin: public blockchain networks.  Quorum, although built with open-source code, is a private blockchain, the kind that was in vogue a few years ago when enterprises (financial institutions in particular) were keen to experiment with the technology but wanted nothing to do with any cryptocurrency.  Lately, though, once-sharp lines have slowly started to blur. According to many ethereum advocates, we are only just at the dial-up internet stage of a totally new value transacting ecosystem. The end goal is connecting the private world of finance with public blockchains.  In an effort that was perhaps unthinkable a year ago, the EEA (which just published its architecture stack diagram) is actively building these bridges, along with the work of the Ethereum Foundation and also the help of a wide and populous developer community.  For her part, Moy said several times that she is “agnostic,” or neutral, about which blockchain or protocols are used. But she said it’s important to stay in touch with the innovation taking place in the public sphere.  “One of the important things for us working on an ethereum variant was kind of being able to stay close to that and potentially even being able to integrate some of that innovation and work into the stuff that we are doing,” she told CoinDesk, before musing:  “Maybe one day this will all converge.”  On the other hand, while she may be protocol-agnostic, Moy believes the basic building blocks for enterprise DLT are now all in place.  “The creation of new protocols in the enterprise space has largely subsided, and there are just a few key protocols that everyone broadly recognizes will remain,” she said.  Quorum quandary  Returning to Quorum, Moy views the project as an example of how open source software, once handed to the community, takes on a life of its own.  “We are entering this interesting point where other entities want to use Quorum, want to take it to production,” she said.  A whole host of entities picked up Quorum and started using it, Moy noted, name-checking IHS Markit, Broadridge, Synechron, ING, and BlockApps. The platform has amassed a tribal following.  ""Quorum has strong momentum in capital markets,"" said John Olesky, managing director at IHS Markit, a global financial data provider. ""It benefits from the halo effect from JP Morgan and the technological rigor that comes from a global bank skilled in enterprise-strength software and compliance issues such as privacy.""  But this raises a problem, because it requires a level of support that’s only really possible if there’s a company dedicated to helping enterprises integrate the technology, the way Red Hat supports corporate Linux users. Businesses want someone they can call to fix bugs or when the network is down. Software support is not the bank’s business.  This is why JP Morgan is mulling over a spin-out. While reviewing its options, the bank is also looking at doing more investing internally and hiring more engineers, a spokeswoman said.  In the meantime, Moy’s focus is on bringing new business applications to Quorum, such as the testing of a debt issuance platform with a host of institutional investors.  Her team recently executed a $150 million Yankee certificate of deposit (denominated in U.S. dollars but issued by a foreign bank) in the form of an ERC-20 token on Quorum. (ERC-20 is the standard that launched countless initial coin offerings on the public ethereum blockchain.)  A smart contract automated the offering, the distribution and, crucially, the “delivery versus payment”– meaning the investors got their securities only upon paying cash. This is notable because cash is king in the world of clearing and settlement – and getting cash onto a shared ledger is seen as a vital part of the puzzle for blockchain builders.  Moy also sees the Yankee CD trial as a harbinger of a more open and transformed financial system.  “This is an example of us issuing a traditional financial instrument natively on the blockchain,” she said. “But the next phase is when you have real asset managers participating in a product like this; it's about, what does custody look like? What does fund administration look like – and what does a trades market look like for something like this?”  Christine Moy photo by Jena Cumbo, via JP Morgan Chase.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/05/10/jp-morgans-new-dlt-lead-were-not-done-with-blockchain-innovation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/925590a73702b2dcaf52fee9898f4020b8ef304c-1367x1254.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Organizers behind the EIP:0 Summit committed to four new governance steps on Wednesday, according to a statement. Notably, Parity Technologies, Aragon and the Web3 Foundation have already pledged their support in signing the statement of intent.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the two-day summit hosted earlier this month addressed governance issues in the ethereum ecosystem resulting from the network's growth and diversity of opinions on technical direction. At present, it is difficult to gauge sentiments among the different parties developing, investing in or securing the software.  To that end, the plan's signatories have committed to creating a statement of shared values for ethereum, supporting the creation of ""open-source tools to collect key signals and metrics,"" having a governance call every month and organizing a second, larger EIP:0 meeting.  Key signals include ethereum transaction volume, the number of deployed contracts, the number of GitHub contributions and other factors.  One way to incentivize that technological development could be through grants, the statement said.  Perhaps most notable, however, is the support that a second EIP:0 Summit is receiving.  For instance, Afri Schoedon, a developer and communications officer at Parity, said in a tweet that ""[the Summit] must be as inclusive as possible. And if 350,000 people show up, we have to deal with it.""  The statement similarly noted that a future summit would have to build on the existing model, including by ""expanding opportunities for interaction from viewers not in physical attendance (time, location and participants to be determined).""
