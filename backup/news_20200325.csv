42404257,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhm2J,1585170027,Devs Plot Launch of Telegram's Blockchain Without Company's Involvement,"A U.S. court order may have barred Telegram from launching its blockchain, but that doesn't mean others can't.      So says the TON Community Foundation, a group of more than two dozen software developers and investors, who are now discussing possible ways to launch the Telegram Open Network (TON) without the messaging platform's participation.      “We consider it seriously,” the group's founder, former communications manager at TON Labs Fedor Skuratov, told CoinDesk. The community is now discussing options and no final decision has been made, he said.      On Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Kevin P. Castel in New York ruled in favor of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which asked the court to deem Telegram’s blockchain tokens, named grams, to be securities, and to halt their issuance to investors in the $1.7 billion token sale. Telegram filed a notice that it would appeal the decision.      The foundation's response underscores the limits of government powers to regulate open-source technology. As with 3D-printed firearms, the state can stop specific individuals or groups from running code, but if it's in the public domain others can take up the mantle.      Read more:Telegram Appeals Court Ruling Barring Gram Token Distribution      According to Skuratov, all the code needed to launch TON is already out there, published previously by Telegram. The community would only need generate the first batch of transactions, or genesis block, and provide at least 13 computers known as validators to run the network.      “Strictly speaking, no additional measures are required to launch TON by the community, except for a consensus within the community. But in order to get recognized, we will need to come to an agreement with investors (at least, with a majority of them),” Skuratov said.      The move would be similar to hard forks, or splintering into separate networks, some other blockchains went through. One key difference in TON's case is the mainnet, or live version of the network, has not been launched yet.    Parallel testnet    In fact, TON Labs, the startup that helped Telegram work on the testnet, or experimental version of TON that's been running since last spring, recently launched its own parallel testnet.      Telegram released the code for TON blockchain nodes in September and kept churning out parts of the project even after being sued by the SEC, publishing a paper on TON's consensus protocol and a native crypto wallet since last fall.      Now the code is available online and theoretically can be used to launch as many versions of the TON blockchain as anyone wants to spin up. It's a different question, however, if such a network would be recognized as legitimate and contain real value – this would require a consensus among the TON investors, Skuratov said.      Read More: Judge Halts Telegram Token Issuance in Injunction Requested by SEC      “Now we will begin to contact those whom we know, and we encourage them to also contact us,"" he said.      According to Skuratov, it’s still being discussed what to do regarding the tokens that have been planned for distribution at launch to investors and the Telegram team in the TON white paper.      As TON is a proof-of-stake blockchain, it will need the validators to stake a meaningful amount of tokens from the start so that they can validate transactions. This means a certain number of grams should be distributed to the project's stakeholders at launch.      Investors impatient    According to one of the investors who asked to stay anonymous, approximately half of the investors at the moment want their money back, on any terms, while the other half would like to see Telegram come up with some way to still issue tokens.      The deadline for TON's launch, rescheduled in October with the investors' blessing, is now April 30. Telegram appears unlikely to meet it, said Yakov Barinsky, CEO of investment firm HASH CIB, which consulted some of the TON investors.      ""But if in October, most investors agreed to postpone, now they wouldn't,"" Barinsky said, explaining that under the agreements signed in October, now investors will only get 72 percent of their money if TON does not launch, but it would be still a good deal given that the capital markets are in a crisis.      Read more: Russia Seeks to Block ‘Darknet’ Technologies, Including Telegram’s Blockchain      But giving money back will leave Telegram underfunded, Barinsky said.      Hence, founder and CEO Pavel Durov ""will be doing everything possible to keep the money, either asking the investors to approve another rescheduling or launching despite the court decision,"" Barinsky said.

42404265,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhm7E,1585168752,This Unstable Moment Is a Chance for Crypto to Go Mainstream,"Mark Blackman consults on emerging technologies after a career at Qualcomm. James Cooper, a CoinDesk columnist, is a professor of law at California Western School of Law in San Diego.      With the impacts of COVID-19 still ravaging financial markets and trillions being deployed by governments and central banks to stem the economic carnage, one cannot help but wonder if this is cryptocurrency’s breakout moment. This unstable environment seems ripe for cryptocurrency to come out of the shadows and become a viable asset class and legitimate alternative to our fiat-based economies. With the proposals for a digital dollar, some legislators in the U.S. Congress seem to think so.      Within a matter of weeks, we have gone from living our lives unencumbered from worry to being confined to our homes and practicing social distancing. With this backdrop, it is easy to believe anything is possible. But is the United States and the rest of the world ready to broadly accept and utilize digital currencies and related blockchain innovations?      See also: The Overton Window Opens for a Digital Dollar      Technology is disruptive, given all the economic and political impacts that come with the adoption of innovations. It is no surprise that the legal structures to regulate the manner in which society utilizes new technologies always lag behind the technologies itself. The regulatory issues surrounding cryogenic freezing of embryos, the advent of online gambling, or the distribution of digitized music are good examples.      Our Founding Fathers did not think about any of these when they set out to create the structures for the democratic governance of this country. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies are no different on the regulatory front. The agencies tasked with protecting consumers concerning securities, overseeing currency, and ensuring the fairness in commodities trading have been slow-footed to catch up to the workings of this complex technology.    We need to clearly determine to what extent smart contracts can be enforced in a court of law.    The dearth of core legal prescriptions is preventing massive adoption. Financial services, property titles, and tax accounting all require new regulations to accommodate the changing realities brought on by blockchain technologies. We need to clearly determine to what extent smart contracts can be enforced in a court of law. There is also a need to increase privacy protections before there is broad adoption of blockchain technologies. Without the fundamentals in place, it will be difficult to trust this new technology with our sacred social relations – identification, our money, our reputation and so forth. This will not be any easier given the immediate need to rebuild our financial systems but for many of us, our jobs themselves.      Beyond the legal challenges, there is the ever-present hurdle of user adoption which continues to prevent the wide scale acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Despite all of the issues with fiat-centric currency, there is great comfort in the traditional security that our current financial services regime provides. If a thief steals your credit card, your funds are replenished; if a bank goes bankrupt, up to $250,000 is covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and if the bailouts and economic stimulus packages achieve their intended outcomes, then our loyalty to the current centralized banking system will only grow.      See also: As This Crisis Worsens, Bitcoin Will Become a Safe Haven Again      For the new world of cryptocurrencies to go mainstream, the average consumer must work through the complexity of current key management implementations. In particular, if cryptocurrencies become a truly distributed asset class, consumers should also be ready to assume their own losses through theft or user error. To maintain legitimacy, we must build the capacity of individuals and businesses to navigate the thousands of incompatible coins and projects to determine what best services their needs. There is a huge need for public education to this end. Moreover, there are few decentralized applications that have sparked the public’s interest or demonstrate a true utility.      Even as Congress considers the use of a digital dollar in its varying versions of the newest stimulus package and the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank continues its study of a digital dollar’s role in the economy, technical and user adoption blockers will remain. There is no doubt a digital dollar can serve as a necessary transitional step, but it will be a new, unproven technology, with the highest of requirements to ensure the scalability, reliability, and ease of use. These problems reflect the legacy of trust that the U.S. (paper) dollar provides. It is likely that government-designed solutions will fail short of their intended mark when compared to proven open source deployed by an ecosystem of competing tech firms.      The federal response to the economic chaos of COVID-19, with both Senate and House bills having considered the introduction of a digital dollar, may well expedite mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. While not known for their nimble innovation nor expedited implementation of laws, the actions this week by the federal authorities auger well for the future of cryptocurrencies. They will not, however, result in a sea change in the world’s financial systems. That will take some time – just like a vaccine for the coronavirus.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,"James Cooper, Mark Blackman",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/25/this-unstable-moment-is-a-chance-for-crypto-to-go-mainstream,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bc320477d4d044e440fdf312e566995b94078105-1480x831.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Global equity markets, however, had a sunnier outlook. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index closed its trading session up a solid 8 percent.

""In 2008, when Lehman filed for bankruptcy, the immediate impact to financial markets was very similar to the reaction that we have witnessed as a result of COVID-19.

See also: Into the Unknown: No Limit on Fed Money Injections      Gold is down slightly on the day as of 20:00 UTC. “A devaluation of global currencies and long-term negative rates are both very positive for gold,” InfiniGold’s Deane noted.

42404271,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhmD8,1585165636,The Overton Window Opens for a Digital Dollar,"Legislation introduced in the U.S. Congress this week signals the Overton Window – a metric of what’s politically feasible – is opening in favor of national digital currencies.      While it’s unlikely we’ll see a digital dollar any time soon, the coronavirus crisis may help precipitate adoption of novel forms of money, members of the cryptocurrency industry and other observers say.      The legislation comes about as U.S. officials look for ways to get much-needed cash into American pockets. According to a Senate bill, using a central bank digital currency (CBDC)*, the federal government could send direct payments to citizen’s wallets held by the Federal Reserve, called FedWallets.      While the proposed bills lack detail, and at least one has been scrubbed of reference to this new payment mechanism, many in the crypto community see this as validation of both an asset class and a set of ideas about the future of the financial system.      See also: Why the U.S.’s $2 Trillion Stimulus, Unlimited QE Will Expose the Monetary System’s Flaws      ""[T]his is not the last we'll see of the digital dollar movement,"" Lawson Baker, founder of Relayzero, a cryptocurrency investment and advisory firm, said in direct message.      The dollar is the United States’ greatest export, and any technologist or financier would want to be a part of its next phase of existence, Baker said. “Favors. Pork. You name it. Everyone wants in to the digitization of the dollar payday.”      Whether introduced out of sheer desperation, as a genuine attempt to utilize instantaneous and transparent payment technologies, or as “bill padding,” as Mati Greenspan, a digital asset researcher wrote, CBDCs are rising up the mainstream agenda. In a few short days, CBDCs have gone from being fringe to getting support from U.S. senators like Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who has proposed digitizing the existing currency and keeping accounts for the public at the Fed.      This centralized version of sovereign national currency likely has the widest support in establishment circles, with backers like ex-Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Chris Giancarlo gathering support through his Digital Dollar Project. At the same time, Facebook and other private entities are also co-opting and sometimes improving on the work of Satoshi Nakamoto.      “We are becoming resourceful in looking at existing technology – and at the flaws in the current system – and applying them to future and current needs,” said Catherine Coley, CEO of Binance.US.      See also: US Senate Floats ‘Digital Dollar’ Bill After House Scrubs Term From Coronavirus Relief Plan      Coley wrote an op-ed last weekend urging Congress to consider blockchain-based stablecoins as a way to payout a direct stimulus. It would save money and reduce contagion risks, she argued. However, the current drafts make no mention of a digital dollar being maintained on a decentralized ledger.      “I'm not going to say I prefer one way or the other as long as we're rapidly moving towards this solution,” Coley said. “Any progress on this matter is a win for everyone. The faster we can get funds into the hands of those that need financial support at this time is crucial.”      Coley’s arguments for digitizing cash payments are pragmatic. There isn’t scientific consensus yet on how COVID-19 spreads, and mailing physical checks to home addresses may negligently expose people to the virus.      See also: 4 Reasons Central Banks Should Launch Retail Digital Currencies      Similarly, Coley reasons that the last time the federal government posted rebates in the mail, in 2008, during Henry Paulson’s tenure at Treasury, many people without stable residences were excluded.      “If the stimulus were delivered via digital assets, every American with internet access, a Social Security number and proof of address could have the ability to access their stimulus,” she wrote. “This [hygienic] distribution would provide a variety of ways for people to get access to cash,” she said.    Libra move    One possible impetus for the government’s examination of digital currencies during this crisis is the much-mistrusted Libra project, spearheaded by Facebook, but moving to decentralize. Coley said, “Libra is perfectly positioned to provide something like this,” but, if up and running, would require everyone to get a Facebook account.      “Are you going to force everyone to open up an account on exchange? The answer is no, but there is an option now for people that are not near their mailboxes,” she said.      As it stands, digital dollars would be paid to wallets maintained by the Federal Reserve. These payments wouldn’t be able to circulate widely throughout the economy, but people would be able to transfer them to their bank accounts and use later as they see fit.      Even such a scaled back approach “would be a first step towards crypto technologies being widely adopted” Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association, a Washington D.C. lobbying firm, said.    People could [grow to] understand that they can have full access to their financial lives.    “Through dollar-backed stablecoins, people could [grow to] understand that they can have full access to their financial lives,” through other digital assets, she said.      But not everyone takes such a rosy view of this solution. Daniel Gorfine, CEO of Gattaca Horizons, a fintech advisory firm, said the current crisis is forcing consideration of how existing technologies can expedite the deployment of money. But he cautioned against moving too quickly.      “Implementing a true CBDC is a really large undertaking. It needs to be done with a lot of care and will involve important questions, design choices and trade-offs,” Gorfine said over the phone.      “While jump-starting pilots and trials could make sense, I caution whether now is the right time to do something as full blown as broadly implementing a dollar-backed digital currency,” he said. “I think it's really important that this doesn't cause any delays in getting emergency funding to needy businesses and individuals through existing channels.”      Gorfine, also the former chief innovation officer at the CFTC, proposed a “digital dollar” along with former CFTC Chairman Giancarlo.      “There's a difference in my mind between doing meaningful pilots versus a whole scale implementation,” Gorfine said. “It seems to me to be something that will take months, if not, years of thoughtful planning.”      Eric Turner, a crypto data researcher at Messari, agreed. ""[CBDCs] aren't a question of if, but when.” A dollar stimulus airdrop is the perfect test application. “But we are at least a year away from the U.S. building such a system,” he said.      If rushed, the procedure could likely do more harm than good, said Josh Lawler, a partner of Zuber Lawler who specializes in crypto and securities law. “The virus situation points to the use case for quick, direct payments of this nature, but it will take more than five days to figure out a way to implement it and not end up in disaster,” he said.      See also: Policymakers Shouldn’t Fear Digital Money: So Far It’s Maintaining the Dollar’s Status      Lawler thinks the current proposals have conceptual flaws “that would drag us in the wrong direction.”      “Those that need it most are the ones that are unlikely to have or know how to use wallets,” he said. Additionally, a digital dollar could be a means of increasing government oversight over personal transactions.      “There are huge security concerns. The Fourth Amendment is at stake here,” Lawson Baker said. Earlier that day Baker tweeted, “Digital Dollar Fed Accounts for consumers [are] worse than the Bank Secrecy Act. Why? Because now the Fed will have direct access to all of your financial transactions AND direct control over the ledger.”      He reasoned this would lead to asset seizure without warrants.      While there are flaws with a bill so quickly introduced, Baker sees the moment as a calling for the crypto industry to rise to the occasion and move its agenda forward.      “This will resonate with people. They'll understand what a digital dollar means. Even if [Congress] had to pull it back and say, ‘We don't want people connecting the dots,’” said Coley. “It means they already know what true digital assets are and therefore are afraid people would connect more dots.”      *Definitions of CBDCs vary from digital ledger entries at central banks to systems necessarily with cryptocurrency design aspects.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | AIRDROP,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/25/the-overton-window-opens-for-a-digital-dollar,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2b42cf7d5510b6a3fbdc2e8bab54554d1b942d16-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel of the Southern District of New York said Tuesday that Telegram's 2018, $1.7 billion token sale appeared to be an unregistered securities sale, and barred the company from issuing grams after it launches its Telegram Open Network. The ruling granted a preliminary injunction request filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which sued Telegram last October.      Telegram filed notice late Tuesday that it would be appealing the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, though it has not provided further details as of press time.      An attorney for Telegram did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

CEO and co-founder Kris Marszalek told CoinDesk that transaction volumes on Crypto.com more than doubled between December and February, with app downloads also hitting all-time highs. ""We saw a million users on our platform last September, and we continue to grow on a monthly basis in double-digit terms,"" he said.      Based in Hong Kong, Crypto.com provides app-based trading services as well as crypto payment solutions through a Visa-powered bank card. When it was known as Monaco, the company raised a total of $26.7 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017. It changed its name to Crypto.com after purchasing the domain name for a reported $10 million in 2018.      Marszalek says the recent robust growth could be a response to the radical steps central banks are taking to stabilize financial markets. In the wake of the coronavirus crisis, the Federal Reserve on Monday launched quantitative easing (QE) with scope to purchase an unlimited amount of Treasury bills and mortgage-backed securities to prop up the U.S. financial system.      See also: Bitcoin, Gold Spike as Fed Unveils Unlimited Coronavirus Stimulus Package      ""People are very interested in crypto in this challenging time,"" Marszalek said, adding that digital assets could offer investors an independent store of value and a possible hedge against the possible side-effects of QE.      Retail investors continued to use the Crypto.com platform even when the market tanked less than two weeks, he added: ""People view this as a buying opportunity.""

42404248,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhlxO,1585147395,Workplace Harassment Lawsuit Against Tron Management Is Going to Arbitration,"A court has moved two fired Tron Foundation employees’ claims of wrongful termination and workplace harassment to arbitration.            On March 12, the San Francisco Superior Court upheld an arbitration agreement the employees signed when they were hired. The defendants — the Tron Foundation, Tron file-sharing subsidiary BitTorrent, Tron CEO Justin Sun and Tron engineering head Cong Li — filed a motion to compel arbitration on Feb. 19, citing the agreement.      “The arbitration provisions incorporated the applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association,” Judge Ethan Schulman wrote in the order compelling arbitration. “[T]he agreements clearly state each party promises to resolve claims by arbitration.”      In arbitration, the case will be heard privately, without a jury trial that would have aired the blockchain non-profit’s dispute in court.      See also: Steem Hard Forks Today Over Fears of Justin Sun Power Grab      The judge also justified the order on grounds the agreement was attached to an employment contract as a separate document that was not hidden from the employees. Plaintiffs Richard Hall and Lukasz Juraszek based their arbitration motion's opposition, filed on Feb. 27, on claims the agreement was presented on a “take it or leave it” basis and that they did not read or understand it.      “Plaintiffs disagree as a matter of law, and we believe the court abused its discretion,” Bill Fitzgerald of Fitzgerald Law Offices, one of two law firms representing Hall and Juraszek, said in an email to CoinDesk.      As of Monday, the lawsuit’s proceedings have been paused until further notice due to a California state shutdown of government buildings spurred by the international coronavirus outbreak. A case management conference scheduled for April was moved to October by a blanket county court order.      Li declined to comment on the arbitration request. Sun and the Tron Foundation’s lawyers at Fisher and Phillips did not respond to requests for comment.    Forced arbitration    The Tron Foundation’s response to the litigation comes as technology companies do away with mandatory arbitration in harassment and discrimination lawsuits.      Last year, Google ended all employee agreements with mandatory arbitration and waived the clause in future agreements, following the precedent set by Facebook, AirBnB and eBay the year before.

42383480,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9w3Hd,1585144207,"Global Stablecoins May Be Subject to Securities Regulation, Says IOSCO","The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) thinks global stablecoin initiatives might be subject to securities laws, according to a new report.      Published Monday, the 31-page examination of regulatory issues around stablecoins – cryptocurrencies with prices pegged to a low-volatility asset reserve – stressed that jurisdiction and regulation ultimately depend on project specifics.      IOSCO looked at a hypothetical stablecoin managed by a company’s governance board, backed by a basket of global reserve currencies and settled on its own private blockchain. It could only be issued to “authorized participants” that buy and sell the stablecoin, and could be passed between users’ digital wallets.      The report did not mention any specific stablecoins by name (though the example looks a lot like the Facebook-led Libra project).      From its hypothetical analysis, IOSCO found such a scheme may fall under securities regulators’ purview.      Because a stablecoin may be used for payments, an activity that ""could potentially amount to regulated payment and banking activities or even regulated payment systems,"" the report says. ""If adopted at a large scale it could become systemically important.""      See also: The US Should Use Stablecoins for Emergency Coronavirus Payments      If the coin project were to grow to become a financial market infrastructure (FMI), ""it would be expected to comply with"" the principles for FMIs (PFMIs) from the Bank for International Settlements, according to IOSCO.      Further, the stablecoin's reserve fund and related interests or obligations ""could amount to various types of securities products, depending on their structure and function.""      The conclusion casts another potential roadblock in development and implementation of stablecoins, especially those that may grow to be integral to financial markets infrastructure.      “It may be challenging for some systemically important stablecoin arrangements to comply with the high standards of the PFMI, particularly for those systemically important stablecoin arrangements that are partially or highly decentralised,” the report says.      That could complicate the paths of stablecoin projects seeking to embrace crypto’s core ethos: decentralization.      See also: The Pandemic Gives Digital Currencies Another Chance to Shine      The Libra Association is the highest-profile global stablecoin initiative to date, and it’s been notably bullish on distributing its governance model and consensus mechanism over the next five years.      “An important objective of the Libra Association is to move toward increasing decentralization over time,” Libra wrote in its white paper.

The Sydney-based stock exchange paused the launch plans for its new DLT-based system that would provide same-day settlements for trades on Wednesday. Originally scheduled for April 2021, consultation on a new implementation timetable, including a new launch date, will start in June, the exchange confirmed in a statement Wednesday.      With the new coronavirus now rapidly spreading in Australia, ASX Deputy CEO Peter Hiom said the exchange's priority was now to monitor daily events and ""focus on day-to-day operations."" Waiting until June before drawing up a new schedule would give the ASX ""more time to consider the replan and better assess the implications of COVID-19,"" he added.

ASX announced a successful first trial in 2016 and finally confirmed it would replace CHESS with a DLT-based system in December 2017. An original launch date was scheduled for Q1 2020, but was then postponed until Q2 2021. In its annual report, published August 2019, ASX said it was ""on track"" to complete the system in time for that date.      ASX said Wednesday it would utilize the extra time to work on the system's operational readiness, review possible changes to its rules of operation and allow back-end engineers to become more familiar with the system ahead of launch.      Plans to trial the new DLT trading infrastructure in an Industry Test Environment (ITE) are still on target for July.      “ASX remains fully committed to CHESS replacement,"" Hiom added.

42383490,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9w3VT,1585136543,Bitcoin Rejected Near $7K Despite US Fiscal Agreement on $2T Stimulus Package,"View  Rejection just below $7,000 and a failed breakout out on the hourly chart has weakened the immediate bullish case for bitcoin (BTC).  A move below $6,250 would confirm a rising channel breakdown on the four-hour chart and shift risk in favor of a drop to support near $5,700.  The U.S. fiscal stimulus does bode well for bitcoin in the long run, according to analysts. More immediately, the cryptocurrency remains at the mercy of sentiment in the traditional markets.    Bitcoin is struggling to maintain its recent upbeat mood on Wednesday despite the rapidly increasing scope of fiscal stimulus efforts in the U.S. and across the globe.      The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading near $6,635, representing a 1 percent drop on the day, after facing rejection at $6,981, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. Prices had rallied from $5,700 to $6,700 in the previous two days.      The pullback from $7,000 has reversed gains seen early Wednesday after White House adviser Eric Ueland informed markets the U.S. Senate and the Trump administration reached agreement on a massive fiscal stimulus package aimed at stemming the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.      The package is expected to be worth $2 trillion and will be put to vote in the Senate on Wednesday. The U.S. Federal Reserve is already running a zero interest rate policy and announced an open-ended asset purchase program, or quantitative easing, earlier this week.      With the announcement, the value of total global stimulus efforts has increased to $8 trillion or 9 percent of the world's gross domestic product (GDP), according to Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya.      A majority of analysts expect the unprecedented stimulus to bode well for bitcoin in the long run.      See also: US Senate Floats ‘Digital Dollar’ Bill After House Scrubs Term From Coronavirus Relief Plan      The cryptocurrency may find bids sooner, too, as the latest stimulus plan will send direct payments and benefits to jobless individuals, according to the New York Times.      ""The U.S. government's cash payments will flow directly into people's pockets. Naturally, some people will buy bitcoin, but far fewer people than others are predicting,"" Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank, told CoinDesk.      Thomas added that fresh money has already entered the market over the last 10 days and fiscal stimulus is unlikely to have a great impact on bitcoin in the short term. An indicator called the “hodler net position change,” tracked by data firm Glassnode, does suggest that investors accumulated coins at under $5,000 earlier this month.      That demand zone, however, could come into play again if the coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, leading to a global liquidity squeeze similar to the one seen earlier this month, he said.      At press time, the equity markets across Europe are flashing green, while futures tied to the S&P 500 are reporting a 1 percent gain. suggesting scope for bitcoin to revisit $7,000.      Technical charts, however, are painting a bearish picture at press time.    Daily chart    The long upper wick attached to Wednesday's candle indicates rejection near $7,000.      The failure to cross the psychological hurdle has weakened the immediate bullish case put forward by Monday's bullish engulfing candle.      Meanwhile, the failed symmetrical triangle breakout on the hourly chart is a powerful bearish signal and indicates scope for deeper losses.    4-hour chart    Bitcoin is trapped in an ascending channel, as seen on the 4-hour chart.      A break below the lower end of the channel, currently at $6,250, would imply an end of the corrective bounce from recent lows under $4,000 and could yield a re-test of support at $5,686 (March 23 low).      So, $6,250 is the level to defend for the bulls.

42383473,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9w38p,1585130400,"Mt. Gox Trustee May Sell Some Crypto Assets, Says Draft Repayment Plan","The trustee of the now-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox intends to liquidate cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin and bitcoin cash, according to a draft rehabilitation plan.      The trustee, attorney Nobuaki Kobayashi, shared with creditors an outline of the draft rehabilitation plan on Tuesday ahead of a meeting Wednesday. The plan marks a significant step toward concluding a case that has kept creditors waiting since 2014, when Mt. Gox collapsed after a 850,000 bitcoin hack.      An outline of the draft (see below), verified by CoinDesk, indicates that creditors who have filed claims for fiat currencies, bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH) will receive these assets in their original form, either via bank transfers or BTC and BCH transactions to addresses at designated exchanges or custodians.      Meanwhile, ""all other assets such as cryptocurrencies other than BTC and BCH will be liquidated into cash to the extent possible,"" the document reads.      Crypto creditors won't be first in line, however, with the trustee saying: ""fiat currency claims allowed in the rehabilitation proceedings ... will be given priority in payment, to secure the interests of such fiat currency claims.""      See also: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      Further, the draft rehabilitation plan, which is yet to be filed and approved in a court, added that the trustee also intends to allow BTC/BCH creditors to request payments in cash if desired.      ""Consequently, a sufficient amount of cash must be secured as the source for distribution for both fiat currency claims and BTC/BCH claims for which cash payment is requested. For reasons including this, the Trustee may, with the permission of the court, sell all or part of the BTC/BCH constituting the Debtor's assets,"" the plan says.      Kobayashi said in the outline that the policy is ""not to purchase additional BTC/BCH."" Therefore, the existing BTC/BCH holdings may not be sufficient as a source for all claims in those assets.      In October, the Tokyo District Court issued an order to extend the deadline for a rehabilitation plan to March 31, 2020.      If approved, the plan could also resolve the legacy issue of how to deal with cryptocurrencies that have come into the trustee's possession as a result of hard forks of the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash networks. In such forks, after a new blockchain is split off from the original chain, all holder's digital assets are duplicated on the new network.      It wasn't disclosed in the draft what quantity of crypto assets other than BTC and BCH the trustee is holding. Its balance sheet indicated it was holding about 141,686 BTC and 142,846 BCH, as of March 2019.      At that time, Kobayashi had approved claims for 802,521 BTC, 792,296 BCH and $38,165,664 in cash, revealing a funding shortfall. The total amount of assets the trustee holds is also unclear at this stage.      See also: Mt. Gox Files for Bankruptcy, Claims $63.6 Million Debt      In November 2018, a hard fork split the Bitcoin Cash network to create Bitcoin SV (BSV). The Mt. Gox holdings of 142,846 BCH would also have brought an equal amount of BSV in the trustee's possession – an amount currently worth about $24 million. A fork of bitcoin into bitcoin cash in 2017 also brought in around 200,000 BCH (now worth $45.6 million).      During the first half of 2018, Kobayashi liquidated around 60,000 each of BTC and BCH following the crypto market bull run in 2017.      Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in 2014 following an infamous hack in which it claimed to have lost 850,000 BTC at the time, although around 200,000 BTC were later found in an old wallet.      In June 2018, the Tokyo District Court granted a petition to move the bankruptcy case to a civil rehabilitation process, allowing creditors to be repaid in their original crypto holdings rather than the fiat value at the time of the collapse.

42383485,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9w3Nv,1585126800,CasperLabs Pivots Away From Ethereum to Fundraise With Its Own Blockchain,"Some crypto startups, including Solana and Dapper Labs, are eager to execute fundraising plans regardless of any coronavirus-induced downturn.      Likewise, CasperLabs, the startup formerly advised by Ethereum Foundation researcher Vlad Zamfir, is now partnering with the Singapore-registered exchange BitMax to conduct its token sale in the form of an Exchange Validator Offering (EVO).      “It’s a really attractive opportunity to participate with the same terms that are usually only available to institutional investors,” said CasperLabs COO Clifford Sarkin.      This fundraising effort comes after the startup raised $14.5 million in 2019 from investors like Arrington XRP Capital and Terren Scott Peizer, who the New York Times dubbed Wall Street’s jack-of-all-trades. It originally focused on Casper protocol experiments.      Since then, CEO Mrinal Manohar said the startup switched to developing a new blockchain inspired by Ethereum’s proof-of-stake plans for participants to deposit their tokens as a way to fuel the network. Manohar’s team of 26 developers and researchers, out of a total staff of 34, plan to launch the new blockchain’s mainnet before 2021. Investor Michael Arrington said he’s not sure whether his firm will participate in the upcoming token sale before CasperLabs’ mainnet launch.      “We will very likely run a node,” Arrington said. “We haven’t made a decision yet on further investment.”      In the meantime, starting on March 30, a new CasperLabs token (CLX) will be sold to retail investors through BitMax, which predominantly serves traders in China, Vietnam, South Korea, Russia and India.      The exchange will automatically stake CLX for buyers when the mainnet launches later this year, after which there will be an enforced 90-day lock up to prevent prompt sell-offs.      “The target audience is for a more sophisticated demographic, since this token won’t be liquid at launch,” said Shane Molidor, head of business development at BitMax.      See also: Long-Festering DeFi Dapp Bug Still Not Fixed by Industry      BitMax is especially popular with crypto traders in Japan and China, where token sales to non-accredited investors may not attract enforcement from securities regulators, as they do in the U.S. But BitMax and CasperLabs are officially registered in Singapore and Switzerland, respectively. And American retail investors will be barred from the sale, Manohar said.      Molidor added that, across the board, his exchange saw more than a 272 percent surge in trading volume this month, compared to February. The coronavirus crisis may turn out to be a boon for exchanges.      As such, BitMax is committed to operating a full node at CasperLabs’ mainnet launch to facilitate staking services for CLX and selling up to $3 million worth of tokens, as evaluated by both participating companies.      “On a relative valuation basis, we’re allowing people to come in at the ground floor,” Manohar said. “It performs exactly like ether will perform when Ethereum becomes a primarily proof-of-stake chain.”    Risky sales    CasperLabs, one of many prospective smart-contract-based Ethereum competitors, is betting its security setup on the hope that the network will quickly decentralize.      Manohar said the team is in talks with several other exchanges and companies that offer staking services. But, as it stands, so far just a few people are committed to staking or running nodes, which could invalidate the security model if it isn’t eventually resolved. Series A investor Omer Ozden of Rocktree Capital said his firm plans to participate in a private token sale and rely on staking services to utilize the tokens.      “We also have a wide ecosystem of partners, clients and projects we have invested in,” Ozden said. “In China particularly, blockchain is being rapidly adopted by large and medium-sized enterprises because of the government's top-down directive.”      See also: Emin Gun Sirer’s AVA Labs Seeks Wall Street Business After Open Sourcing ‘Avalanche’ Protocol      From Ozden’s perspective, he said he wants to see this project as part of the emergence of “Wall Street 2.0.”      Meanwhile, CasperLabs employees will retain roughly 8 percent of the token supply, restricted with a three-year vesting period. Manohar said the total token supply, yet to be launched, will be worth an estimated $100 million.      When asked how to sell such assets to retail investors in coronavirus-stricken jurisdictions, he replied “terms reflect several things to protect risk,” such as the prospect of “built-in yields” once the network launches.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/25/casperlabs-pivots-away-from-ethereum-to-fundraise-with-its-own-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bfda2302221fd81fadbcfe5ddb5f53d58cec36a8-1400x601.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383488,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9w3Sx,1585116000,"For DeFi’s Sake, Maker Should Take Blame for Black Thursday Losses","Anthony Xie is the founder of HodlBot, a trading tool that enables cryptocurrency investors to automate their trading strategies.      Many lifelong cryptocurrency stalwarts had their savings wiped out on Black Thursday when a sudden price crash triggered the auction of under-collateralized ethereum (ETH) posted in the MakerDAO vaults.      While the system did not technically malfunction, a confluence of factors enabled a few opportunists to win the collateral auctions despite placing extremely low bids.      The question stands as to whether MakerDAO should be held responsible for this incident.      See also: MakerDAO Debts Grow as DeFi Leader Moves to Stabilize Protocol      To better understand this situation, first, some background on how MakerDAO works.      For DAI to maintain its price at $1, it must lock away $1 worth of ether, plus an excess amount in a collateralized debt position.      The point of over-collateralization is to help DAI maintain its currency peg. This way, when the price of ETH falls, the value of the underlying collateral is still equal or greater to the value of DAI issued. The target liquidation ratio determines the amount of over-collateralization required.      In the event of a price crash, DAI can become under-collateralized.    More than a third of all liquidations were practically free.    The underlying ETH can only withstand so much of a price crash before it becomes less valuable than its corresponding DAI.      In this case, users can trigger collateral auctions on vaults that now have too few holdings.    The collateral auction process    The MakerDAO network deems a vault unsafe once the posted collateral falls below the amount mandated by the liquidation ratio.      When vaults are in breach, any user can trigger a collateral auction by sending a bite transaction identifying the unsafe vault.      Once an auction commences, participants bid with DAI to acquire the collateral.      The highest bid wins the auction when it remains undefeated for the minimum bid duration (10 minutes).      While this auction system worked in the past under normal circumstances, the crash led to unfavorable conditions causing the auction system to short-circuit and malfunction. Consequently, $8.3 million of ethereum was liquidated for $0.      See also: ""Rune Radio,"" CoinDesk's Most Influential profile of MakerDAO impresario Rune Christensen      During the crash, the ETH network experienced heavy congestion and increased gas prices. Price oracles, parts of the system responsible for fetching market prices, were delayed.      Once the price oracles came back with the news of the market crash, the updated system deemed a large number of vaults to be under-collateralized all at once.      Sensing the opportunity, a few users started triggering liquidation auctions. Then they placed very low bids, often $0, as they realized no other “keepers” were bidding against them.      The reason nobody else was bidding was because the keeper market had collapsed. Not only did heavy network traffic cut down the number of keepers in droves, but a liquidity squeeze was also afoot. Many keepers shut down because they were unable to liquidate ETH fast enough for DAI. Others refused to participate during the liquidity squeeze because the price of ETH was falling too quickly. For example, users incurred a loss after buying ETH for 170 DAI and selling it at 130 DAI two hours later.      After 10 minutes of silence, the opportunists were able to settle their winning bids and acquire all of the ETH posted in the sale.      According to the whiterabbit research team, out of 3,994 liquidation transactions, 1,462 (36.6 percent ) were realized with a 100 percent discount.      More than a third of all liquidations were practically free. Cumulative losses from auctions with zero bids amounted to $8.325 million.      The biggest vault lost 35,000 ether.      The /r/MakerDAO community on Reddit, usually an incredibly steadfast and loyal group, was extremely upset about this incident.      See also: DeFi Leader MakerDAO Weighs Emergency Shutdown Following ETH Price Drop      Those who lost their lifelong savings clamored for MKR holders to take responsibility by compensating victims.      Others pointed fingers at MakerDAO for the lack of accountability. They demanded questions to be answered, such as why the governance protocol changed the minimum bid duration from 3 days to 10 minutes.      Although some argued that the keeper market and collateral auction worked as intended, others countered that the risks were understated and not made clear.      No summary can adequately capture the rawness and veracity of the victims’ accounts. To get a first hand-look, take a look at the top-ranking posts /r/MakerDAO in the past month.    Should Maker compensate?    So far, there has been no planned recourse for the victims of $0 liquidations.      The MakerDAO team’s immediate concern seems to be neutralizing the network deficit by minting new MKR tokens to buy back under-collateralized DAI.      However, they’ve opened up a discussion thread to determine whether compensation should be issued, and if so, how it would happen.      See also: MakerDAO’s Problems Are a Textbook Case of Governance Failure      To an outsider like me, MakerDAO’s response does not seem adequate enough. We have seen this pattern too many times in the traditional financial markets, where large financial institutions transfer tail risks onto their clients.      Innovative DeFi projects will inevitably run into obstacles like this and will need to iron out their intra-system rules. But that does not mean that that burden of systematic failures should be placed upon the shoulders of a few unlucky end-users.      A well-funded project, like MakerDAO, should own up to these mistakes and take responsibility for them. Otherwise, it will severely hamper the confidence of new users, as well as the confidence of their existing community members. If users have less confidence in the project, then it will be harder for MakerDAO to gain product adoption even if their infrastructure is not prone to being susceptible to the same mistakes.    Should Maker take blame? The debate on Reddit    Maker has already eaten about two-thirds of the loss, as they paid out DAI as the loan on the collateral.      Many liquidation victims sold their DAI for ETH and put the ETH back in the collateralized debt position for a more favorable liquidation ratio. As such, they would have lost significantly more than one third.      All the information about how liquidations took place is available on-chain in the form of smart-contract code.      If Maker wants to make the jump to mainstream adoption, it should describe protocol mechanisms in clear, easy-to-understand language.      See also: Thursday’s Market Madness Strained Ethereum’s Killer App: DeFi      Users could have run keeper bots to liquidate their vaults at favorable rates.      Maker can’t expect all users to be programmers.      Users were fairly liquidated as they failed to keep enough collateral in their vault.      The Oasis Dapp, created by MakerDAO, clearly stated that the liquidation penalty would only be 13 percent. This instruction was highly misleading and underrepresented the risk to users.      Setting a precedent for compensating vault users could undermine the game-theoretical mechanisms underpinning the protocol.      The current mechanisms are not perfect, and they must be improved. If users expose protocol short-comings and suffer from harm in the process, then the community should compensate them.",NEUTRAL,ETH | MKR | DAI,ETH | MARKET | MKR | TRADING | DAI,Anthony Xie,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/25/for-defis-sake-maker-should-take-blame-for-black-thursday-losses,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e24b66504d5c5204641538212265f0b62004e748-1480x833.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Since then the startup has started working with Volvo to trace cobalt for electric batteries and Daimler for tracking CO2 in the supply chain.      Circulor CEO Doug Johnson-Poensgen confirmed the talks with Everledger.      “The emerging market for traceability is large,” he said. “We expect that the cooperation that exists between large IT companies now will apply to the upstarts who have meaningful traction like Everledger and ourselves. It all comes down to effective ways of serving the needs of our customers.”      Exploring the ethical and sustainable use case together makes sense because Everledger and Circulor are both built using the same open-source technology called Hyperledger Fabric, an enterprise blockchain heavily backed by IBM.    Double bottom line    Everledger was one of the first companies to show that blockchains can have uses outside of cryptocurrency, creating an immutable digital record of diamonds starting in early 2015. The firm has since built an impressive network of partnerships that cover some 40 percent of all diamonds in circulation.      As well as being first to market, Everledger combines what CEO Kemp calls “value and values,” using blockchain to verify not only that a diamond didn’t come from a factory but also that it didn’t come out of slave labor.      “We saw that the next most potentially conflicted supply chain is going to be in rare earths and batteries,” said Kemp.      Underscoring the importance of the ESG component in this choice, Kemp added: “We’re not interested in tracking lettuce. That’s not where the world needs us to be.”      Johnson-Poensgen anticipates a broad range of use cases opening for Circulor. For instance, it’s not just cobalt mined in places like the Democratic Republic of Congo that is a problem in making batteries, he said: Lithium extraction threatens to cause an environmental catastrophe in South America’s Atacama desert by polluting water sources.      Other exciting areas include chemical recycling of plastics, or creating a circular economy for cotton, much of which is picked using forced labor in places like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan before it even gets to the sweatshops in Bangladesh, said Johnson-Poensgen.      “Every one of these raw materials comes with significant ESG concerns in different parts of the world. Complex industrial supply chains face significant challenges and that’s what we’re interested in,” he said.    Enter IBM    As well as having chats with Everledger, Johnson-Poensgen says Circulor has also been talking about interoperability with IBM.      Unlike a small and nimble startup, IBM has taken a heavyweight consortium approach to sustainable supply chain tracking. Back in April 2019, IBM launched the Responsible Sourcing Blockchain Network (RSBN), which is currently focused on cobalt for batteries and includes the likes of Ford Motor Company, Volkswagen Group, LG Chem and Huayou Cobalt.      “The challenge with the consortium is it slows you down because doing things by committee is not the most efficient way to go,” said Johnson-Poensgen. “I want to provide customers with coalition benefits without consortium constraints. So Daimler pays for all the work around CO2, which will benefit Volvo, without formally having got into bed together.”      Sai Yadati, a partner at IBM Global Business Services, said Big Blue has refined its blockchain governance model to collaborate at speed and is on track for a production release in June of this year.      Yadat said IBM was open to explore interoperability with other Hyperledger projects.      “Industrywide collaboration is certainly our goal,” he said. “We're collaborating with other networks that share common goals, and interoperability is an important part of our 2020 roadmap.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/25/everledger-looks-beyond-blood-diamonds-with-esg-supply-chain-collaboration,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3fc4a4fb413d9b969cdf01b0695ba0eb1d534d9a-1500x889.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
