Donald vs Israel (DONISRA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONISRA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Donald vs Israel can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald vs Israel could become the next viral memecoin. Donald vs Israel launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Donald vs Israel on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald vs Israel by entering its contract address – CKYA6Q1KcWsSJyXgFKwyNXyTAjHD1dRPKTDD2FTUFryn – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONISRA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/solana-memecoin-donald-vs-israel-donisra-to-skyrocket-16000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-while-dogecoin-and-shiba-inu-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37228644,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=657064,1733355049,"US Govt Moves 54.9 billion Shiba Inu, But SHIB Could Explode By 130%","A wallet linked to the United States government has transferred over 54 billion Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens to a newly created wallet. Popular blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence indexed the transaction on December 3. Announcing the move on X, Arkham stated: “ALERT: US GOVERNMENT MOVING $1.5 MILLION OF SHIBA INU.” Specifically, the US government transferred 54,897,092,549 SHIB tokens to the Ethereum wallet ‘0x995’. Following the transaction, the sending wallet—associated with the US government—no longer holds any SHIB tokens. The recipient wallet, now with a total crypto portfolio valued at $33 million, has retained the assets. Notably, the US government acquired these SHIB tokens through the seizure of assets from Alameda Research, the trading firm affiliated with the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX. This seizure was part of a broader forfeiture action involving more than $700 million in assets due to legal issues surrounding FTX and Alameda. The SHIB tokens were among a variety of digital assets seized during this process. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Could Increase 75% If It Holds Current Level – Analyst Shares Price Target Data from Arkham suggests that the recipient wallet was newly created. Its first transaction occurred recently when it received $1.061 million worth of AEGRO tokens from the same wallet that moved the SHIB tokens. Within less than two hours, the wallet also received other crypto assets from the US government-affiliated address, including 4,815 ETH (approximately $17.9 million), 13.58 million BUSD ($133 million), and 631,959 POWR ($221,000). While it remains unclear whether the US government has sold its SHIB holdings, the absence of any identified exchange or over-the-counter (OTC) addresses linked to the transaction suggests that the government may still hold the tokens. Shiba Inu Price Analysis: Potential For A 130% Surge? Crypto analyst Rony Kapoor (@LearnRony) shared a comparative chart analysis between Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) on X, stating: “Next leg up in SHIB will be like DOGE? Shib looks like big Cup & Handle pattern forming like doge before it run turbo. Sooner or later Shiba Inu will pump!!!” The chart for DOGE illustrates a clear “Cup and Handle” formation—a bullish continuation pattern that often precedes a significant price breakout. DOGE’s handle formed near the $0.21 mark, and following a period of consolidation, the token rallied to a peak of approximately $0.48. This move represented a substantial 128% increase from the breakout point. Related Reading: Shiba Inu All Set For ‘Bull Show’, Eyes 180% Rally – Analyst Similarly, SHIB’s chart indicates the potential formation of a Cup and Handle pattern, with the structure still developing. The current trading price is hovering around $0.000030, with resistance levels identified at $0.000038—the anticipated handle resistance. If SHIB follows a trajectory similar to DOGE, a successful breakout could target a price level around $0.000087, based on the proportional increase observed in DOGE’s previous movement. Technical indicators such as the Fibonacci retracement levels support this analysis. SHIB is currently trading below the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $0.000032. A break above this level could see SHIB targeting the 0.786 Fibonacci level at $0.000038. Subsequent targets include the yearly high from March at $0.00004569. Notably, the all-time high of $0.00008854 aligns closely with the projected target from the Cup and Handle pattern identified by Kapoor.

Qubetics Projected to Hit $15 – The Best Crypto to Join This Week Amid Monero’s Upgrade and Avalanche’s 200% Volume Spike,"The crypto market is active, and investors focus on the coins that could yield massive gains. Choosing the best crypto to join this week can be a game-changer for your portfolio in this dynamic landscape. With major updates from Monero and Avalanche, alongside the exciting presale of Qubetics, there’s a lot to unpack. Monero’s focus on privacy has kept it a favourite among enthusiasts, while Avalanche’s recent price surge has brought it back into the spotlight. But the real star of the moment? Qubetics ($TICS). With its innovative solutions for financial institutions and a presale generating serious momentum, $TICS is positioning itself as a standout opportunity. This article will discuss the latest updates for Monero, Avalanche, and Qubetics, with a special spotlight on why Qubetics might be the best crypto to join this week. From Borders to Breakthroughs: Qubetics Leads the Charge The Qubetics Network is shaking things up in the financial sector by offering banks and institutions a cutting-edge blockchain solution. With $TICS, institutions can execute near-instant cross-border payments , cutting down the delays and high costs associated with traditional methods.

To top it off, Qubetics recently hosted a well-received AMA session , where they shared insights into their vision and roadmap. Want to know more? Dive into the details from their AMA—it’s worth the watch. Monero ($XMR): The Privacy Pioneer’s Latest Move Monero continues to lead the charge as the go-to cryptocurrency for privacy-conscious users. With its untraceable transactions and decentralised nature, $XMR has carved out a unique space in the crypto world. Recently, Monero announced enhancements to its stealth addresses, making it even harder to link transactions to individual users. This upgrade reinforces Monero’s commitment to safeguarding financial privacy in an era of increasing surveillance. As debates around privacy and regulation heat up, Monero’s relevance and appeal remain rock solid. Avalanche ($AVAX): The Momentum Keeps Building Avalanche has been making headlines with a significant price surge. Currently trading at $46.34, $AVAX has gained over 4% in the last 24 hours, with trading volumes skyrocketing by 200% to hit $2.07 billion. Investors are optimistic about the coin’s potential to break the $50 mark, driven by whale accumulation and institutional interest. What’s fueling this growth? Avalanche’s scalability and low transaction costs make it a favourite for DeFi applications. As more institutional investors recognise its potential, the demand for $AVAX is expected to climb even higher. 6200+ Holders and Counting: Best Crypto to Join This Week If you’re searching for the best crypto to join this week , Qubetics’ presale is the golden ticket. In Phase 11, $TICS tokens are priced at just $0.028, but that won’t last long. Each weekly phase introduces a 10% price hike, culminating in a massive 20% jump in the final stage. Over $4.3 million has already been raised, with 6200+ holders securing 266 million tokens. Here’s the kicker: $TICS is targeting $0.25 per token post-presale. That’s a staggering 783.45% ROI potential for those who act now. Should the token price climb further to $15, as predicted, a $1000 investment would reach an extraordinary $530,173.50, with an ROI of approximately 52,917.35%. With excitement building and the next phase imminent, this presale isn’t just an opportunity—it’s a must-grab for anyone looking to make serious gains. Think about it: in just a few weeks, you could hold a token primed for exponential growth. But the window is closing fast, so don’t wait. Conclusion: Your Next Move in Crypto The crypto market is brimming with opportunities, but picking the best crypto to join this week is crucial. Monero’s privacy innovations and Avalanche’s price momentum offer compelling cases for investors. But Qubetics steals the show with its transformative vision and an electrifying presale that promises unbeatable ROI potential. If you’re serious about maximising your gains and joining a project with groundbreaking utility, Qubetics is the one to watch. With $TICS poised to disrupt financial systems and a presale offering massive rewards, there’s no better time to get in on the action. Don’t just follow the trend—be part of the movement.

37231255,https://cryptonews.com/?p=316431,1733355000,"Regulators Plan to Allow S Korean Universities to ‘Trade’ Crypto, Companies to Follow","South Korean financial regulators are set to allow universities to “trade” crypto sometime in 2025, a report has claimed. Per Hanguk Kyungjae , the Financial Services Commission (FSC) is also ready to let local government bodies sell crypto. And it will allegedly follow up by eventually allowing companies to open corporate crypto wallets . Universities to ‘Trade’ Crypto in 2025? The newspaper claimed sources had told it the FSC will release a tentatively named “Roadmap for Allowing Corporations to Open Virtual Asset-Won Accounts” before the end of this year. Critics have accused Seoul of dragging its feet on the matter, allowing American, European, and Japanese companies to steal a march on domestic firms. Many South Korean firms want to use their balance sheets to buy cryptoassets, aware of the fact that Bitcoin (BTC) -buying strategies have helped many overseas firms boost the value of their assets. South Korea's martial law turmoil strains alliance with US https://t.co/bKA1QOfTmd — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) December 4, 2024 However, South Korean legal conventions do not allow corporations to invest in Bitcoin or other tokens. The FSC reportedly wants to “gradually” roll out regulations that will change that. And the body reportedly wants to begin with universities, schools, and local government bodies. Several major universities have received crypto donations in recent years. But government guidance currently prevents them from selling their coins for cash. There is no law that explicitly bans public bodies and corporations from opening crypto wallet-linked bank accounts. However, regulators have told domestic banks not to accept applications from anyone except private citizens. The FSC document allegedly outlines a “Stage 1” on the roadmap, which will allow “central government ministries, local government bodies, public institutions, other non-profit organizations, and universities” to “trade” crypto. South Korea’s financial markets tumbled on Wednesday following a night of political chaos, as President Yoon Suk Yeol briefly declared martial law only to withdraw the measure just hours later under pressure from lawmakers. https://t.co/SVXisTSfqp — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) December 4, 2024 University Wants to Make WEMIX Sale The move will allow universities such as the elite Seoul National University (SNU) to finally sell altcoins they have been holding for years. The domestic gaming firm WeMade donated a large quantity of its WEMIX (WEMIX) token to SNU back in 2022. The university has since repeatedly submitted requests to the Ministry of Education and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to allow it to sell the coins. However, the FSC rejected all of these requests, concerned that it could lead other companies to try to promote their coins by donating them to schools. Experts say they think SNU is currently holding some 800 million won ($566,000) worth of WEMIX. WEMIX prices over the past four years. (Source: CoinMarketCap) The media outlet added that “Stage 2” of the roadmap will focus on crypto exchanges and other crypto-related businesses. An unnamed official explained: “In order to foster the virtual asset industry and increase the effectiveness of regulations, business operations such as issuance, listing, and brokerage should be carried out as if [coins] were stocks or bonds.” “Stage 3” of the roadmap will finally give most private companies the right to buy and sell crypto, although this is listed as a “mid to long-range” goal. Banks Last to Get Green Light? The final two “stages” of the roadmap will see “financial companies,” a group that likely includes banks, granted permission to access the crypto market. However, the newspaper said the FSC was “considering building safety measures” into its regulations. One of these will likely see limits placed on stock exchange-listed companies. These companies will only be allowed to “hold a small percentage of their capital” in crypto. This move, Hanguk Kyungjae wrote, will help “prevent side effects” such as the creation of “Bitcoin-themed stocks.” Crypto speculators kept Bitcoin in sight of the landmark $100,000 level in anticipation of further steps to support the sector by Trump https://t.co/cCfVdAcE07 — Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) December 4, 2024 The FSC may find this to be something of an uphill battle. The Korea Exchange is already highly influenced by Bitcoin price fluctuations, with even minor shareholders in unlisted crypto exchanges experiencing high price volatility when crypto news breaks or BTC prices rise . At present, the only South Korean public bodies with fiat-tradable crypto wallets are the Prosecution Service and the National Tax Service. The tax body uses its wallets to liquidate crypto confiscated from (mainly local) tax dodgers . The prosecution mainly uses its wallets to sell the coins of convicted crypto fraudsters.

Seasonality and high RSI suggest the coin may be taking a breather. Bitcoin's Dominance in the crypto market has fallen from 60% to 55% in just two weeks. BRRR is currently trading at a very small discount to net asset value. The fund has not benefitted from Grayscale fee flight to the same degree as other spot ETFs. After a four-month rally, the market has taken Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) from a low of $49k in early August up to $99.7k in late November. An epic tease, perhaps. With many, myself included, expecting a $100k BTC price, crypto's top coin is taking a breather. Have we already seen the top for this cycle? I have my doubts about that, though I don't think the top is as far away as others seem to believe. But with this recent pullback in the orange coin and another month of on-chain activity in the books, I think it's worth updating readers with how I'm seeing the ball currently. In this article, we'll look at chain usage data, seasonality, market dominance, and assess whether the CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ETF ( BRRR ) is the right financial product for investors who want long-term exposure to BTC. On Chain Data Token Terminal If you'd like to see a picture of 'Gresham's Law' in one chart, the one above might suffice. Since September 2023, Bitcoin's price has surged while monthly active addresses have fallen off a cliff. At 9 million active addresses during the month of November, monthly active addresses (or MAAs) on Bitcoin have fallen by 43% year over year while the price of the coin has nearly tripled. I've made this case ad nauseam at this point, but my personal view is that less people using Bitcoin is only sustainable if average transaction fees remain elevated to counter both the declining usage and the declining coin issuance long term. Otherwise, the hash rate is at risk of collapse as ledger validation loses incentive. Thus, my view is investors are better off if monthly fees trend up. Token Terminal For the month of November, Bitcoin produced $38.3 million in fees. This was a 19.2% decline from the $47.4 million fees produced in October and a 73% decline from the $142.1 million produced from transaction fees in November 2023. The general trend in transactions each month has been higher going back to January. That said, there was a 21% MoM decline in November as Bitcoin processed 16.1 million transactions - down from 20.5 million in October. November 2024 transactions were also slightly behind the 16.4 million in November 2023. Token Terminal The average transaction fee was essentially flat month over month from $2.38 in October to $2.41 in November. TPS fell month over month from 7.7 to 6.2. All things considered, network usage was down in November by most important metrics. As has been the case for some time, Bitcoin is being used primarily as a fiat hedge rather than as a peer to peer payment network. Of course, none of that means the price of the coin will go down. If anything, it's indicative of a broad crunch on supply. But I believe there are additional factors to consider. Seasonality & Bitcoin Dominance In previous articles for Seeking Alpha, I've noted the terrific historical setup for Bitcoin seasonality in the fourth quarter - particularly in years of and following halving events. October and November have notoriously been terrific months for Bitcoin gains, December is much less clear: TrendSpider Going back the last 11 years, Bitcoin has a 45% chance of delivering a positive return in December. Despite the month generally being a toss up from a gain or loss standpoint, the mean return is 8%, which still makes December a solid month for Bitcoin on paper. But BTC is typically feast or famine in December. Going back to 2011, December has resulted in a single digit percentage return in either direction just 4 times. So it's a 'go big or go home' kind of month historically. TrendSpider We've also seen Bitcoin generate positive returns in each of the last three months between September and November. Bitcoin has actually generated positive returns for four consecutive months starting in September three different times in the past. But I would caution against expecting that to happen again. Bitcoin is very much a part of the traditional investment world now and that puts the coin at risk of profit taking to end the year and the quarter, in my view. Furthermore, judging by indicators like the RSI, there are signs that BTC is technically overbought on several time frames. Exhaustion in the BTC move is potentially why we're seeing so much action in altcoins like XRP ( XRP-USD ). CoinMarketCap 'Alt season' may finally be upon us. Over the last decade, we've seen the general trend in long term 'Bitcoin Dominance' has been down. As calculated by CoinMarketCap.com, Bitcoin Dominance of the $3.45 trillion crypto market cap has fallen from 60% on November 10th down to 55% on December 3rd. If that was indeed the cycle peak for Bitcoin Dominance on 11/10, it would be yet another lower high in the long-term trend dating back the last two halving cycles. The point is, seasonality and Bitcoin Dominance may both be signaling that the better returns from here are in the altcoins rather than in Bitcoin. BRRR In a recent article covering Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) for Seeking Alpha, I shared the most recent weekly capital flow data that we have from CoinShares. While the net flow in the final week of November was positive for the broader digital asset investment landscape, Bitcoin was actually down by nearly a half a billion dollars in a single week: Asset ($m) Week Flows MTD Flows YTD Flows Bitcoin -$457 $6,226 $33,912 Ethereum $634 $1,427 $2,198 Multi-asset -$16 -$25 $441 Solana -$4 $40 $110 Binance - $0 -$2 Source: CoinShares, Bloomberg, as of 11/30/24 In spite of the final week of November sales, full-month net flow for Bitcoin was enormously positive at over $6.2 billion. That brings the full-year capital flows to nearly $34 billion for Bitcoin. Despite the clear enthusiasm for this asset from the investment community, the CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ETF has not enjoyed the same level of interest: BitcoinTreasuries With a little over 9k BTC managed by the fund, investors haven't looked to BRRR for Bitcoin allocations to the same degree that they have with other funds like the iShares Bitcoin ETF ( IBIT ) or the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF ( FBTC ). There are a few different reasons why there could be relative lack of interest for BRRR, though all of these are just my own speculations. The fund originally launched with a 0.49% expense ratio after waiver expiration. That expense ratio has since been dropped down to 0.25%, which is very much in line with the rest of the market. But it's possible that early fee mispricing soured the market on BRRR. Larger funds are managed by companies like BlackRock ( BLK ), Grayscale, and Fidelity - which may give those ETFs an advantage in areas like product marketing. The fund's original manager, Valkyrie, sold to CoinShares shortly after launch, which may have also contributed to confusion in the market. Again, all of these are just guesses. It's important to keep in mind that smaller funds could potentially produce larger swings in the NAV rate than bigger funds: Data by YCharts So far, we haven't really seen BRRR decouple dramatically from the larger players in the market. That said, at market close on 12/2/24, BRRR shares could be had for a 0.25% discount to NAV, larger than both IBIT and FBTC. Closing Thoughts As far as Bitcoin specifically, I think we're witnessing a small pullback in price that will allow altcoins to have their moment. I suspect there are better gains in select alts from here. That said, I'm of the view that we have not yet seen the peak in BTC for this cycle. I still think we see a BTC price that eclipses the long-awaited six-figure level. There may be better ways to play that possibility as a trade than through BRRR shares.

37228002,https://crypto.news/?p=14316328,1733353837,"Powell says Bitcoin is a competitor for gold, not a dollar","Bitcoin has recently become known as an investment instrument that is called “digital gold” to preserve the value of money; Powell says the same. The chairman of the Federal Reserve (The Fed), the central bank of the United States, has publicly called Bitcoin ( BTC ) a competitor for gold due to the aspect of preserving the value of money rather than using it as a currency. “It’s just like a gold only it’s virtual. People are not using it as form of payment or as a store of value. It’s highly volatile. It’s not a competitor for the dollar, it’s really a competitor for gold,” Powell mentioned on The New York Times DealBook Summit 2024 posted video on YouTube. He also noted that the growing crypto industry should find a position that is suitable for the conventional banking system, which is his concern, and that it must be safe and supervised. Although the central bank does not regulate crypto directly, Powell aims for the people who are involved in these digital assets to have consumer protections, no matter what the crypto-product they hold. Powell also claimed that he does “not at all” hold any crypto, after being asked by the American journalist and author on that occasion, Andrew Ross Sorkin.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. PropiChain’s token presale attracts investors seeking 10,000x gains with its RWA and AI offerings. Table of Contents Why PropiChain is attracting investors PropiChain’s RWA and AI features set a 10,000x presale gain potential Conclusion The crypto market is buzzed about the PropiChain token presale , with investors and top crypto insiders rallying behind its solutions, which combine AI, RWA tokenization, and metaverse integrations. This distinctive feature has set PropiChain apart from other real estate altcoins in the blockchain space, creating unparalleled excitement among investors seeking exponential returns. Why PropiChain is attracting investors Compared to other real estate altcoins in the market, PropiChain’s approach seeks to solve challenges, including inefficiencies, high transaction costs, fraud risks, and reliance on real estate agents. Traditional real estate investment methods are often slow and prone to error, further complicating cross-border transactions and making users vulnerable. Hence, with the assistance of PropChian’s AI technology, investors can be confident that every transaction is efficient and secure. These DeFi integrations, alongside strong blockchain technology, have led to PropiChain’s token presale garnering attention among investors and expert analysts. The project’s recent listing on CoinMarketCap has also solidified potential investors’ interest in its token presale. PropiChain’s thorough security review by BlockAudit is also a huge propeller, as meeting such stringent standards usually culminates in mainstream adoption and higher valuations.

The platform’s interactive experience surpasses traditional methods, with virtual tours, stagings, and meetings reducing uncertainty and enhancing confidence in purchase decisions. Its AR/VR capabilities will eliminate geographical obstacles, allowing users to experiment with different layouts and interior designs to explore a property’s potential fully. RWA tokenization: PropiChain’s approach to digitizing RWA will allow investors to own fractions of high-value real estate assets, lowering barriers to entry and expanding global accessibility.

37227907,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622849,1733353381,"Altcoin searches soar as Bitcoin holds steady at $97K, searches hit record high","The interest in altcoins is growing at an incredible pace, backed by the increased Google search trends and high market turnover. While Bitcoin remains relatively flat above the $97K level, the altcoin market is now back in focus among retail traders and analysts, raising expectations of an altseason. According to Google Trends, the search interest for the term “altcoins” hit 100 in early December. This increase is not a steady growth because it has been observed in the course of 2023. In November, searches reached a high of 93 and then declined to 56 mid-month, which coincided with the market’s response to Donald Trump’s announcement of his presidential candidacy and Bitcoin’s record value. In the past, similar search volume surges have pointed to the involvement of the retail investor, an essential component of the cryptocurrency price movements. The last similar peak was observed during the 2016/2017 bull cycle, which means that the cycle of interest in altcoins is repeating when the BTC price is stable. Several other digital assets have come to light as the top performers in the current market cycle. XRP and XLM have each more than quadrupled this month but are still down from their all-time highs. On the other hand, Binance Coin (BNB) and Tron (TRX) have hit new highs in the market, indicating strong market activities. Altcoin season indicators Crypto analysts are paying attention to these trends in order to determine the general mood in the market. According to Jamie Coutts, the Chief Crypto Analyst at Real Vision, the market dominance of Bitcoin is not the only sign of an altcoin rally. Instead, market breadth, the number of assets trading above their Bitcoin counterparts, paints a different picture. Coutts also notes that the Altseason Indicator, which currently sits at 67%, means that altcoins are in the consolidation phase. However, other analysts, including Daan Crypto Trades, say that the true altcoin season starts when this metric is above 75%. However, the indicator has not reached high enough levels to suggest that the altcoin season has started. The Alt Season Index has been rising at a rapid pace in the past week. It's now sitting at 67, which means that 67% of the top 50 alts outperformed #Bitcoin in the last 90 days. Above 75%+ it's officially labelled as ""Alt Season"". https://t.co/3Z87crI8cx pic.twitter.com/qfHU6dhpSo — Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) December 2, 2024 According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, the transfer of assets from Bitcoin to altcoins is no longer the main factor that moves the market. Rather, the increase in trading volume of the altcoins is being driven by stablecoin and fiat pairs. He stated, “Stablecoin liquidity better explains the altcoin markets.” This futher suggests the shift to real-world application and unique features of the altcoins.

According to a new report by Fox Business, anonymous sources familiar with the matter say that Trump is considering Boring to take the reins of the regulatory agency, partially due to her ability to be conversant and telegenic in presenting financial topics to the public. Other top contenders for the job include Summer Mersinger and Caroline Pham, who both currently serve as Commissioners for the CFTC, as well as Jill Sommers, a former Commissioner of the agency who currently serves as the chief of the derivatives practice group at Patomak Global Partners, according to the report. Neal Kumar, a former special counsel to the CFTC and the current co-head of the commodities and derivatives practice at Willkie Farr and Gallagher, is also in the running. Earlier this year, the Chamber of Commerce – with Boring at its helm – argued that Democratic lawmakers Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown were attempting to take down the crypto industry by proposing bills to make it comply with the same anti-money laundering laws that apply to traditional finance. At the time, Boring penned a letter to Brown asking him to kill the bill. Last year, Boring predicted that Bitcoin ( BTC ) would hit a price tag of $1 million by 2029 if its adoption continued at the rate it was going. According to the CEO, a combination of a spike in demand and a lack of supply will push the crypto king to higher prices during the next few years. Bitcoin is trading for $94,944 at time of writing, a marginal decrease during the last 24 hours.

Its performance was boosted by its newly launched AI-integrated products, which analysts also cited in optimistic fiscal forecasts for 2025. In late October, the customer relationship management (CRM) software heavyweight launched Agentforce, a suite of autonomous AI agents that augment employees and handle service, sales, marketing, and commerce tasks. Impressive Agentforce outing and positive forecast for 2025 In the early hours of morning trading, Salesforce shares hit $368.7, a record high that resulted in a potential addition of $35 billion to its current market valuation of $316.85 billion. Many analysts raised their price targets because of their confidence in the stock, according to LSEG data. Salesforce stock went up 26% this year, with a new median price target of $380 representing an upside of about 15%. Other US tech company stocks in the cloud space have also seen surges in their stock prices. For example, Oracle saw a 3.2% rise, while ServiceNow gained 3.5%. Others like Datadog and Snowflake both saw a 4% rise. Expectations for Salesforce’s revenue for the 2025 fiscal year have slightly increased by $100 million, increasing to a new range between $37.8 billion to $38 billion compared to its previous forecast of $37.7 billion to $38 billion. The company also beat analyst revenue estimates, which rose to $9.44 billion during the third quarter of this year. While its steady growth continues to impress, analysts expect increasing enterprise adoption of Salesforce’s solutions to help the company to a steady double-digit percentage growth performance. Salesforce enters a competitive autonomous AI agent market With Agentforce, Salesforce enters the race for stakes in the supply of autonomous AI agents that help businesses complete tasks. It enters competition with the likes of Microsoft, and a rivalry is already developing between both companies. Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, called out Microsoft in October on X (Twitter) , saying the latter’s Copilot does work and doesn’t deliver any level of accuracy. He also added in a press release that Agentforce is the third wave of AI and actively drives customer success. When you look at how Copilot has been delivered to customers, it’s disappointing. It just doesn’t work, and it doesn’t deliver any level of accuracy. Gartner says it’s spilling data everywhere, and customers are left cleaning up the mess. To add insult to injury, customers are… — Marc Benioff (@Benioff) October 17, 2024 A week before Agentforce’s release, Microsoft announced that it would be enabling customers to build autonomous AI agents through its Copilot studio in the following month, which was November. So far, Salesforce’s Agentforce seems to have delivered on its promise. Bullish on its early success, Salesforce has gone on to project that its AI product will continue to close more deals as it has already delivered 200 deals since its launch. Other than the success of its Agentforce AI, Salesforce’s high-performing data cloud was another major contributor to the company’s strong quarter. To meet up with increasing demand for Agentforce, Salesforce executives are reportedly planned to hire 1400 new staff members in the fourth quarter.

His prediction has thrilled the XRP community, who are now excited about the potential. However, the analyst has also underlined a new Ethereum token, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , with an even better prospect. He insists that the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token will yield higher returns than the XRP price, which is poised to reach $28. XRP Price To Touch $28 Soon, Analyst Claims After correctly predicting that the Dogecoin price will surge massively in 2021, the renowned analyst has once again stated that the XRP price is on its way to $28. The Ripple community has welcomed this news with excitement, as the XRP prive touching $28 will yield significant profits for investors. According to data on CoinGecko, the XRP price is $1.46. A potential surge to $28 will transform investors’ finances by 1,845%. Despite the Dogecoin analyst’s prediction, chances of the XRP price touching $28 soon are low, as the altcoin is struggling with spikes and dips. The Dogecoin analyst, however, named an emerging token with a better prospect than the XRP price: WallitIQ (WLTQ). Interestingly, the token is trading at a low price, as it is still in its presale stages. Investors who want higher returns at a low cost are already storming the ongoing WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale. Analyst Claims The WallitIQ (WLTQ) Token Holds Better Prospect Than XRP Price Hitting $28 According to an analyst who predicted the historical Dogecoin price surge, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token holds better prospects than the XRP price hitting $28. The Dogecoin analyst insists that WallitIQ (WLTQ) has the potential to surge by 17,000% in the bull run. This means investors holding the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token could accrue 17,000% profit in the current bull market. Since this prediction, investors have caught FOMO and are rapidly joining the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale. The presale has raised over $1.3 million and is still fast increasing every day. Priced at only $0.0171 per token, investors can still buy the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token before it sells out. With the demand increasing daily, the presale is poised to sell out in a few days. Beyond its rewarding presale, WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) potential lies in its unique features that make storing and transacting cryptocurrencies smooth and easy. As a decentralized crypto wallet, WallitIQ (WLTQ) allows investors to store their cryptocurrencies without hassle. It is developed with cutting-edge AI technology to create a secure and productive environment for crypto investors and holders. To verify its robust security, SolidProof , a top blockchain audit firm, has audited its smart contract and found no irregularities. Not to mention, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has been listed on CoinMarketCap , a significant milestone for the Ethereum token. WallitIQ (WLTQ) incorporates Escrow Connect (AI-Einstein) , an inventive security feature that provides top-notch protection for investors’ assets, into its platform. This security feature uses advanced authentication, making sure that every connection between investors’ wallets and dApps or web3 websites is secure. This way, investors’ assets are safe from phishing attempts and malicious activity. Investors are provided with AI-powered smart suggestions on the WallitIQ (WLTQ) crypto wallet. The AI technology analyzes real-time data, offering investors actionable insights to assist them in various tasks. These tasks include selecting the right transaction fees, choosing staking opportunities, deciding when to buy or sell holdings, etc. Final Thoughts While the XRP price surge promises investors a potential return of 1,845%, the new Ethereum token, WallitIQ (WLTQ), will provide a higher return potential of up to 17,000% on money invested and at a lower cost. Moreover, the analyst is renowned for his accurate predictions in the crypto space, notably his Dogecoin price surge forecast. Consequently, investors who want enormous returns at a low price should buy the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token now!

Robot Musk (MUSKROBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Robot Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Robot Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Robot Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Robot Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Robot Musk by entering its contract address – KuyNyMswF1p3jYpJwNCsfeM86pnhjMb6urb3EKyNVje – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

Meanwhile, Putin’s swift actions show Russia is working quickly to secure its position in the crypto space. Bitcoin has emerged as a tool for circumventing Western sanctions, especially during the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Russia turned to Bitcoin to maintain access to global financial networks without relying on traditional banking systems. At the BRICS summit in November, Russia and other emerging economies discussed using cryptocurrencies for cross-border payments. This shows Russia’s plan to lead in global crypto adoption, making the coin a key part of its international financial strategy. Russia Push for Financial Independence Through Bitcoin-Friendly Law Putin’s actions suggest that Russia is positioning itself to be a major player in the crypto space. Recently, Russia enacted a new legislation that exempts Bitcoin mining and sales from Value-Added Tax (VAT). The new regulation also removes taxes on services related to electronic payments. Additionally, services related to electronic payment systems, including those involving crypto, will no longer face tax liabilities. These steps not only provide a tax-friendly environment for digital asset transactions. It also aims to create an ecosystem where Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can thrive. By embracing BTC, Russia can leverage this digital asset to strengthen its financial reserves. This is especially true in the face of ongoing geopolitical tensions. The move could be part of a broader strategy to reduce the country’s reliance on the U.S. dollar and traditional financial systems. The Crypto Market’s Response: Bitcoin on the Rise The market responded positively to Putin’s endorsement of Bitcoin. In the 24 hours following his remarks, Bitcoin’s price jumped by 2.88%, trading at $98,752. The digital asset saw a trading volume of $73 billion. This surge indicates that market participants view Russia’s legal and policy changes as a boost for Bitcoin’s legitimacy and long-term growth. The favorable regulatory environment Russia creates could encourage further investment in Bitcoin. This could potentially lead to a ripple effect in global crypto markets.

The solution leverages stablecoins to streamline global transactions. The new solution allows businesses to use a Visa-supported physical or virtual card to make payments using stablecoins. Nuvei Taps Visa and BitGo to Bring Stablecoin Payments to LATAM Merchants In a December 4 announcement , Nuvei revealed partnerships with Rain, a Coinbase Ventures and Circle Ventures-backed issuing platform, crypto custody provider BitGo, and the global payments giant Visa. More payments innovation in LATAM! Businesses can now use stablecoins to make faster cross-border B2B payments and settlements through Nuvei’s partnership with Rain, BitGo, and Visa. Read the full announcement here: https://t.co/OigzUJFlr0 pic.twitter.com/FLqZ3ALZuz — Nuvei (@Nuvei) December 4, 2024 The new solution allows LATAM merchants to make payments using stablecoins through a Visa-supported physical or virtual card. These payments can be made from a digital asset wallet anywhere Visa is accepted. The system benefits from Visa’s global acceptance and offers simplified corporate treasury management, secure digital asset custody, faster cross-border transactions, reduced currency complexity, and improved business liquidity. “By integrating stablecoin technology into our payment platform for B2B settlement, we’re ensuring our merchants continually receive unparalleled flexibility, security, and global reach,” Nuvei Chair and CEO Philip Fayer stated. The launch aligns with a growing trend in LATAM toward stablecoin adoption. The region has seen increased traction for blockchain-based financial solutions, with Tether and Circle leading programs in key markets like Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil. The company has recently achieved several milestones, including becoming the first global payments service provider to offer direct local acquiring in Colombia, launching local acquiring services in Mexico, and securing a Payment Institution license in Brazil. Visa’s USDC on Solana: A Game-Changer for LATAM Crypto Payments? In September 2023, Visa announced it was testing USDC settlements on the Solana blockchain, with payment processors Nuvei and Worldpay joining the initiative. This move reflects the growing industry focus on integrating stablecoins into traditional financial systems. Stablecoins are increasingly popular in Latin America (LATAM), offering a more stable alternative to volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. A June 2024 report by blockchain analytics firm Kaiko revealed that USDT is more widely used than Bitcoin in the region, highlighting the preference for stable digital assets in daily transactions. According to Chainalysis, LATAM received 9.1% of the global cryptocurrency value between July 2023 and June 2024. The region received nearly $415 billion in cryptocurrency during this period, ranking just above Eastern Asia. Centralized exchanges (CEXs) dominate the crypto landscape in LATAM, and 68.7% of participants use them—slightly trailing North America. Most of the transaction value in LATAM is driven by institutional and professional investors, entities transacting over $10,000. The region has emerged as the second fastest-growing crypto market, with a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 42.5%. Argentina leads LATAM in cryptocurrency value received, estimated at $91.1 billion, followed closely by Brazil at $90.3 billion. Diverse markets in countries like Venezuela, Argentina, and Brazil have greatly contributed to the region’s rapid adoption and growth.

37227362,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98364,1733352363,"Fear Looms Over Potential Bitcoin Price Dip After United States Govt Moved 19,800 BTC","The United States government recently transferred 19,800 Bitcoin (BTC) worth approximately $1.92 billion to a Coinbase Prime wallet. This sparked fears of a potential sale around crypto circles, with traders on high alert. The assets moved to Coinbase constitute part of the Silk Road seizures. In 2022, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) seized over 50,000 BTC obtained from the Silk Road dark web. On-chain Analysts Flag Transfers Data from on-chain crypto from Arkham Intelligence showed the transfer split into two wallets. The government moved $969 million to the first wallet, while $949 million was sent to the second address. The government’s wallet now holds 188,303 BTC, which is currently worth $18.2 billion. The transfer sparked sell-off concerns among market participants. This is because asset movement to centralized exchanges often signals a potential sale while transfers to other custodians point to a long-term holding strategy. A similar situation occurred in July which led to a a market plunge. Specifically, the US government sold 29,799 BTC and the asset’s price plunged 24% as a result. “A transfer of such a large amount of Bitcoin to an exchange, especially Coinbase Prime, often signals an intent to sell or distribute. This can create bearish sentiment as market participants anticipate increased supply. When the U.S. Government sold 29,799 BTC on July 29, 2024, the market experienced a sharp price drop, with Bitcoin losing over 24% in value. Such large-scale government sales typically create significant selling pressure,” crypto analyst Amr Taha noted. Bitcoin Price Falls The impact of the US government transfers has been felt in the market, as they wiped off efforts at a price recovery. Bitcoin’s price plunged 2.3% to trade at $95,568 as traders continue to monitor the situation. The market leader influences the wider market and might re-ignite, leading to a rally in altcoins. This was seen in the last meme coin frenzy, as prices moved after huge inflows to BTC. Meme coins are largely influenced by community rallies on social media spaces, among other things.

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE.

37226826,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98361,1733351375,Top Pundit Warns Ripple’s XRP Could Still Crash Back Below $0.60 Despite Recent Stunning Rally,"XRP, the token stewarded by Ripple, has been one of the best performers in the crypto market. On Monday, the XRP price skyrocketed to a fresh seven-year high above $2.81, buoyed by a series of post-election catalysts ranging from hopes of increased regulatory clarity to the potential for U.S.-listed spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, despite XRP’s stellar price action, a popular crypto pundit thinks the token could still drop back below the $0.60 mark. IncomeSharks Explains Why XRP Could Fall To $0.60 In a recent post on X, analyst IncomeSharks told his 576K followers that the Ripple-linked token might be on the verge of a major drop. IncomeSharks observed that roughly 43% of the available coins are not yet in circulation, as Ripple still holds roughly 38.9 billion tokens in its escrow accounts. “There’s a reason this space collectively dislikes this token because it’s always pumping and dumping,” the expert said. In an accompanying chart, IncomeSharks shows that the price of XRP spiked from just a few cents in 2017 to its current lifetime peak of $3.40 in January 2018, only to crash just months later. Notably, a similar trend was witnessed during the 2020/2021 market cycle amid the Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple. Over 43% of the $XRP tokens are still not even circulating. Imagine if you were on Pump Fun and saw the developer owned 43% of supply. There's a reason this space collectively dislikes this token because it's always pumping and dumping. pic.twitter.com/n7wMvyU2nR — IncomeSharks (@IncomeSharks) December 2, 2024 The pundit’s chart suggests that the over 430% gains that XRP witnessed since November could soon vanish. He projects a potential correction from its recent high near the magical wonderland of $3 to as low as 60 cents in the coming weeks. This would represent a nearly 80% fall from current price levels. IncomeSharks further argues that XRP is the “biggest joke in 10 years of crypto,” and after a 4X monthly pump, people tend to “pretend like it’s legit.” XRP Community Disagrees Members of the XRP community quickly refuted IncomeShark’s claims. Moon Lambo, for instance, noted that literally all cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), experience amplified euphoria at some periods in time, with a price correction ensuing. As such, this price behavior is not limited only to XRP. Other XRP backers slammed IncomeShark’s claims concerning XRP’s circulating supply. Analyst Credible Crypto stated that no meme coin has tokens locked in an inaccessible escrow, released slowly over extended periods. He stressed that the wider cryptosphere knows about XRP’s supply dynamics and that IncomeShark prefers to overlook this fact to fit his flawed narrative. “Chart looks fantastic when you actually look at complete price history instead of zooming in on the last consolidation to fit some “never-ending dump” narrative lol. It takes some time to digest a 110,000% move up and that’s all the last 7 years were. Now the next leg has begun,” Credible Crypto continued. Others asked the naysayer to name another crypto asset that has maintained its position within the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap even while mired in a high-profile lawsuit with the SEC.

According to the charges, Ver had failed to file taxes for $50 million of $240 million worth of Bitcoin transactions in 2017. Other charges include that he undervalued his assets when he relinquished his US citizenship in 2014 to escape higher taxes on expatriation. Bitcoin Jesus fights back!

(Coinpedia) #Bitcoin #RogerVer pic.twitter.com/FxgWqZDvZt — Crypto Professor X (@CryptProfessorX) December 4, 2024 According to prosecutors, Ver undervalued two companies before his expatriation – MemoryDealers US and Agilestar – in order to pay less exit tax. The exit tax affects the untaxed capital gains of persons giving up their citizenship in the United States. Ver’s lawyer has since come to his defense and stated that the accusations are due to the absence of clarity in the laws regarding crypto taxes at the time. The defense also points out that the IRS issued its first official guidance on how cryptocurrencies should be taxed in October 2014, when Ver had already renounced his US citizenship The indictment also states that Ver avoided payment of taxes in regard to many Bitcoin transactions in 2017. However, his lawyers claim that he was entirely dependent on the advice of his advisors to make sure that he did not breach any laws. Ver’s lawyers from the firms of Steptoe LLP and Kimura London & White moved to dismiss the case on the grounds of governmental misconduct. They submitted that the prosecutors unlawfully obtained privileged communications between defense counsel and their clients and improperly used them to bolster their case. The defense says that Ver sought legal advice on how to meet all the legal requirements, including taxes and emails that reveal his intention to meet his obligations. In one 2013 email to his attorney, Ver stated his wish to avoid future disagreements with the IRS over his exit tax payments. The defense has also claimed that Ver is being selectively prosecuted for daring to speak out against the US’s perceived over-zealous regulation of cryptocurrencies. They claim that filing criminal charges in a case of regulatory violations that are not well defined is unconstitutional. Crypto community criticizes DOJ The case also illustrates the ambiguity of cryptocurrency taxation in the early 2010s. This case has attracted much interest from the cryptocurrency industry. Civil rights attorney Robert Barnes, a supporter of Ver, said that this was a clear case of selective enforcement. “This prosecution reflects political targeting rather than an objective review of the evidence,” Barnes said. Additionally, Peter Schiff, a renowned economist, also supports Roger Ver’s motion to dismiss tax evasion charges. He stated , “Hopefully, he wins, forcing the government to lower the top income tax rate or risk a flood of expatriations.” #Bitcoin pioneer @rogerkver 's motion to dismiss tax evasion charges on the grounds that the ""exit tax"" is unconstitutional is correct; it’s an unapportioned direct tax.

The transfers involving tokens such as Ethereum (ETH), Binance USD (BUSD), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) stirred curiosity across the digital asset sector. Details of the Transfers According to data from blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, the transactions included two significant transfers of 5,024 ETH and 3,739 ETH, valued at $18 million combined. The funds were sent to unknown addresses beginning with “0x9cd” and “0x9ac.” The wallet labeled by Arkham as “FTX Alameda Seized Funds” also moved $13 million in BUSD and $1.5 million in SHIB. Other cryptocurrencies were also involved in the transactions, including $36,070 worth of Axie Infinity (AXS), $106,430 in Compound (COMP), Numeraire (NMR) valued at $93,950, WBTC worth $50,710, and $47,350 in Yearn Finance’s YFI. The transfers coincided with a broader market rally, with nearly all of the tokens included in the transactions experiencing significant upticks over the last seven days. ETH is currently trading at $3,726, almost 28% lower than its all-time high but 9% up on its level from a week ago, and an increase of more than 50% compared to its value a month ago. On-chain Ethereum volume also hit a year-to-date high of $183.74 billion in November, with analysts attributing the surge to market participants reallocating capital from centralized exchanges to decentralized on-chain activities. More Government Crypto Activity This latest transfer follows another major movement of digital assets by the U.S. government. On Monday, a wallet labeled “U.S. Government: Silk Road DOJ Confiscated Funds” moved nearly $2 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) to Coinbase Prime. The platform has emerged as the government’s go-to service for cryptocurrency liquidations, especially with the stash seized from the darknet marketplace founded by Ross Ulbricht in 2011, continuing to play an important role in the narrative of Bitcoin’s price movements. Arkham Intelligence reported that the transaction involved 19,800 BTC being split between two wallets: one received 10,000 BTC worth $969 million, while the other was credited with 9,800 BTC valued at $949 million. These actions mirror similar movements reported in July, when the blockchain analytics company highlighted that another $2 billion worth of Bitcoin, also seized from Silk Road, was divided across separate wallets. At that time, nearly 28,000 BTC were split, with 19,800 coins valued at $1.3 billion sent to one wallet and 10,000 worth $670 million sent to another. The U.S. government maintains substantial Bitcoin holdings obtained through seizures and asset forfeitures. As of December 4, its digital asset holdings totaled $19.6 billion, and data shows that these include significant amounts of Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, WBTC, and BNB.

However, readers should note that, over the past week, several firms across industries, from medical to financial, have made significant purchases, indicating a potential sign of accumulation. BlackRock has bought $1 BILLION dollars of Bitcoin so far this week. It is only Wednesday. pic.twitter.com/veMsqtPep8 — Arkham (@arkham) December 4, 2024 Since November 11, 2024, BTC’s price appears to be in a consolidation zone, which may explain why whales, institutions, and retailers are continuously showing confidence and interest in the asset, making significant withdrawals from exchanges. $963 Million of BTC Outflow Besides BlackRock’s recent purchase, since the beginning of December 1, 2024, exchanges across the cryptocurrency landscape have witnessed a significant outflow of $963.35 million, as reported by Coinglass . In the context of cryptocurrency, outflow refers to the transfer of assets from exchanges to wallet addresses. Source: Coinglass Additionally, outflows hint at a potential buying opportunity, reduce selling pressure, and suggest a possible upside rally. Bitcoin Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels In addition to these bullish on-chain metrics, an expert has shared a positive outlook for Bitcoin. According to the expert’s technical analysis, BTC has broken out of a symmetrical triangle price action pattern on the four-hour timeframe and is heading toward the $100,000 mark. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price action, if BTC closes a four-hour candle above the $98,000 level, there is a strong possibility it could breach its all-time high of $99,588 and reach the $100,000 mark. BTC Current Price Momentum At press time, BTC is trading near $97,900 and has registered a price surge of 2.10% in the past 24 hours.

37227571,https://cryptonews.com/?p=316478,1733350285,IcomTech Promoter Sentenced To Decade In Federal Prison,"IcomTech promoter David Brend has been sentenced to a decade behind bars for the cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme following his conviction on conspiracy to commit wire fraud in March. IcomTech Promoter David Brend Sentenced According to the Monday press release , Brend worked under co-defendant David Carmona and alongside Gustavo Rodriguez in operating IcomTech, a cryptocurrency mining and trading platform launched in early 2018 that promised “guaranteed daily returns” on investor funds. However, U.S. prosecutors claim no actual digital asset trading or mining occurred for the exchange’s customers, with fellow promoters using “victim funds to pay other Victims, to further promote the schemes, and to enrich themselves.” A Manhattan federal judge hit a Florida cryptocurrency salesman with a 10-year prison sentence for his role in promoting the $58 million IcomTech Ponzi scheme, saying he victimized others in a ""get rich quick"" scam and may do so again. https://t.co/1tPH5SmOBO — Law360 (@Law360) December 3, 2024 The U.S. government alleges that Rodriguez largely designed IcomTech’s digital interface. At the same time, Brend served as a “face-to-face salesman who peddled the bogus enterprise and its supposed lucrative returns for investors.” IcomTech promoters further enacted the massive crypto scheme by attending lavish expos in luxury cars and wearing expensive clothing, giving the illusion that the sham digital asset company could offer investors financial freedom. However, this facade began to crumble by August 2018 as investors struggled to withdraw their funds from the platform. “As complaints mounted, IcomTech began offering proprietary crypto-tokens for sale as a means of injecting liquidity into IcomTech,” the press release states. “Promoters of the schemes claimed that these tokens…would eventually be worth a significant amount of money…” In reality, the tokens had zero real value and led to further financial harm to the schemes’ victims, who stopped receiving funds entirely by the end of 2019. Crypto Ponzi Scheme Criminals Face The Music Rodriguez was sentenced to eight years in federal prison in Manhattan federal court on October 31 of this year for helping to orchestrate the digital asset scheme. He has also been ordered to pay $40,000 in restitution for his crimes. Meanwhile, Brend has additionally been ordered to pay for his crimes, with his forfeiture to be determined by a USDNY judge later. “Together with others, Brend and Rodriguez defrauded thousands of people out of millions of dollars,” U.S. Attorney Damian Williams stated. Both were found guilty by a unanimous jury. Now they will serve substantial prison sentences for their crimes.” The post IcomTech Promoter Sentenced To Decade In Federal Prison appeared first on Cryptonews .",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | SPONSORED | TRADING,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/icomtech-promoter-sentenced-to-decade-in-federal-prison/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37227571.jpeg

Looking back six months, it's up by 160.69%, indicating strong growth over time. Currently, Dogecoin trades between $0.39 and $0.47. The nearest resistance level is at $0.50. If it breaks this point, the next target is $0.59, which could mean a potential gain of over 25%. On the downside, the nearest support level is $0.33. A drop to this level would represent a decline of about 15%. There's also a second support at $0.25, which would be a more significant fall. SHIB is nearing its resistance at $0.00003897. If it surpasses this, the next target is $0.00004881, potentially increasing the price by around 40%. The nearest support level is $0.00001929. Falling below this could lead to a drop to $0.00000945, a decrease of about 51%. Based on recent performance, SHIB could rise further if resistance levels are broken. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a significant surge in its price over the past month. In the last week alone, the coin's value increased by 23.86%. Over the past month, SHIB skyrocketed by 78.67%, showing strong upward momentum. Even over the last six months, the coin has grown by 19.64%, indicating sustained interest.

The Relative Strength Index is 61.42, indicating the coin is approaching overbought territory but still has room to rise. The positive MACD level of 0.0000002707 supports the bullish outlook.

This digital asset has soared by an astonishing 12,500% during its presale phase. Investors are buzzing with excitement. Discover what sets this crypto gem apart and why it might be the next big thing in the market. DOGEN: The Ultimate Memetoken for Real Alphas Who Always Win Imagine living a dream life — posh cars, fat stacks of cash, and women who turn heads. That’s the DOGEN lifestyle! If you’re the kind of guy who’s always looking to level up, you need to check out DOGEN. This meme token is for the real alphas who always win. 💎 HODL Like a Beast, Dominate the Market 💎 This thing is about to explode!

Get in early, and watch the others try to keep up while you’re already at the top! ⚡️ Missed Out on WIF, Popcat, or Ponke? ⚡️ DOGEN is the new alpha on the Solana blockchain, running with the big dogs like BONK, WIF, and Popcat — all of which blew up with 1000% gains at some point. Right now, DOGEN’s flying under the radar, but it’s about to set new records in this bull run. You don’t want to miss out on this one. Got that DOGEN spirit? Good, ‘cause they’re holding an airdrop!

Grab some DOGEN and dominate the crypto world! 🚀 Dogecoin: The Evolution of a Meme into a Top Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) was created in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies, featuring a Shiba Inu dog from an internet meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin's limited supply, Dogecoin has no maximum supply, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. Initially considered a ""memecoin,"" it gained significant attention in 2021, partly due to endorsements from Elon Musk. Its market capitalization exceeded $50 billion, placing it among the top cryptocurrencies. The coin's potential lies in its strong community and the visibility it has gained. However, its attractiveness in the current market cycle depends on various factors, including market trends and investor sentiment. SHIB: The Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Expanding Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It was launched in August 2020 by an anonymous person known as Ryoshi. SHIB started with one quadrillion tokens, with half sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a large portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned the rest, reducing the total supply. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB can interact with Ethereum-based applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. It also plans to offer a future NFT platform and a governance system. These features could increase its usefulness in the crypto world. The coin's integration with Ethereum and ongoing developments may make it an interesting option in the current market. Conclusion With DOGE and SHIB showing less potential in the short term, DOGEN emerges as a superior choice. Tailored for those who pursue excellence, DOGEN anticipates significant growth and follows the success of tokens like BONK and WIF. Early adopters enjoy exclusive benefits, joining a community of leaders aiming to dominate the market.

Analysts believe cryptocurrencies may soon take the spotlight as their market share drops to 55.80% and a confirmed sell signal flashes for the first time since 2020. As Bitcoin’s price battles to sustain its momentum and falls below important trendline support, this sentiment picks traction. Related Reading: XRP Still Below Its All-Time High As Crypto Explodes 107%, Psychologist Says Bearish Signals Trigger Altseason Conjecture The relative strength index (RSI) indicating Bitcoin’s dominance is trading below its midline, therefore reinforcing negative expectations. Such situations have historically cleared the path for what is known as “altseason”—a time when other cryptocurrencies shine above Bitcoin. Experts contend that capital from Bitcoin could move into altcoins, generating instability and fresh investing prospects. The sell signal has just flashed on the Bitcoin dominance for the first time since 2020 Let the real fun of #ALTSEASON begins pic.twitter.com/R9QeCO69YH — Mikybull 🐂Crypto (@MikybullCrypto) December 3, 2024 This trend corresponds with the lowered holdings among long-term Bitcoin investors, hence it is not only theoretical. Recent data from IntoTheBlock shows that wallets containing Bitcoin for more than 155 days currently only possess about 12.45 million BTC, the lowest number since mid-2022. These balances, declining almost 10%, point to some individuals cashing in gains or shifting their money to cold wallets. Bitcoin: Decline In Long-Term Holdings As the anticipated $100,000 goal for the alpha coin gets closer, Bitcoin’s price has run into strong resistance. Multiple failures at $97,500 have led to big drops. Bitcoin fell even more on Tuesday, selling around $93,940. This volatility is matched by a clear drop in long-term assets, which makes it hard to tell where the market is going. Bitcoin long-term holders are gradually reducing their balances, now holding 12.45 million BTC—the lowest level since July 2022. So far, this decline is less severe than in past cycles. Long-term holder balances have fallen by 9.8% this cycle, compared to 15% in 2021 and 26% in… pic.twitter.com/eA5Cckrgs4 — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 3, 2024 Although the present drop in holdings is less significant than those in 2021 or 2017, it draws attention to shifting market attitude. Some observers say this conduct shows purposeful repositioning by experienced investors trying to fit changing market conditions. Rare Bullish Signal Provides Hope Among Bearish Mood Even with the negative undertones, a rare bullish indication gives some hope. Recently in line with moving averages, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) indicates that Bitcoin might rally in the next one to two months. Such signs are rare, only once or twice during an upward market cycle. Related Reading: Cardano To Hit $10? Analyst Thinks It’s Happening This Cycle Although the bearish pressure is still evident, experts note that these positive signals provide risk-tolerant investors some good possibilities.

For now, the declining dominance and increasing volatility of Bitcoin highlight the need of a careful yet strategic approach.

37226938,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51375,1733349645,Litecoin Rallies on Spot ETF Hype; Ripple vs. SEC Battle Fuels Bullish Trend & BlockDAG Tops Among Utility Coins — Can it Hit $30?,"The cryptocurrency market is experiencing renewed interest, driven by major events shaping investor sentiment. Litecoin (LTC) surged on the promise of a Spot ETF amid speculation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation, though its trajectory faces tempered expectations. Meanwhile, in the ongoing Ripple (XRP) vs SEC case, partial legal victories against the SEC have fueled XRP optimism. While legal and regulatory developments dominate headlines, BlockDAG (BDAG) is drawing attention for entirely different reasons. BlockDAG showcases immense potential as a utility coin, enabling up to 15,000 transactions per second and seamless EVM compatibility for decentralized applications. With over $155 million raised in its presale and crypto analysis predicting a $30 by 2030 value, BlockDAG has captivated crypto enthusiasts with its robust infrastructure and scalability. Litecoin Spot ETF: Price Rallies & Market Fluctuations Litecoin’s market saw significant growth in October after Canary Capital filed for a Litecoin Spot ETF, pushing LTC to $75 and boosting trading volume by 150%. Despite this initial excitement, enthusiasm cooled, and LTC corrected to $68.84 before rebounding to $91 following speculation about SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation. The pro-crypto sentiment surrounding a potential Litecoin Spot ETF approval has sparked optimism, as it could attract traditional investors to Litecoin. While the ETH Spot ETF’s lackluster performance tempers expectations, a Litecoin Spot ETF could still enhance market visibility and drive long-term interest in the coin. Ripple vs SEC: XRP Eyes $10 on Settlement Hopes The ongoing Ripple vs SEC lawsuit has significantly impacted XRP’s value, keeping it between $0.4 and $0.7 since December 2020. Recent developments, including partial legal victories and rumours of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s resignation, have propelled XRP above $1, a three-year high. Edo Farina, CEO of Alpha Lions Academy, predicts that an emergency settlement in the Ripple vs SEC case could drive XRP to $10. This optimism is tempered by mixed reactions within the community, with some viewing the forecast as overly ambitious and others expressing skepticism about a near-term settlement. BlockDAG’s $155M Presale: The Utililty Coin That Redefines Blockchain The cryptocurrency market is witnessing significant developments, such as Litecoin Spot ETF and Ripple’s high-profile legal case with the SEC. These events reshape perceptions of blockchain technology and top crypto assets , pushing utility coins to the forefront. Among them, BlockDAG has become a strong contender, offering advanced solutions for the decentralized ecosystem. BlockDAG emerges as an innovative utility coin, revolutionizing the decentralized ecosystem with its advanced Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology. Unlike traditional blockchains, BlockDAG supports simultaneous block creation, achieving up to 15,000 transactions per second (TPS). This high throughput ensures scalability for applications requiring rapid processing. Its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility integrates seamlessly with Ethereum-based smart contracts, empowering developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) across industries using familiar tools. By combining speed, scalability, and interoperability, BlockDAG lays the groundwork for widespread adoption. BlockDAG’s advanced architecture has captured heightened attention in the crypto market, as evidenced by its highly successful presale. The project has surpassed a whopping $155 million milestone, with more than 16.5 billion coins sold. As this presale rally continues, analysts predict BDAG, currently priced at $0.0234 in its 26th batch, could reach $30 by 2030. With its solid foundation, BDAG presents a compelling opportunity as an undervalued asset in the evolving blockchain space. The Top Crypto Assets While Litecoin navigates ETF-driven momentum and Ripple vs SEC legal battle progress, BlockDAG showcases the true potential of the crypto market with its top-level architecture and scalability. Crossing the $155 million presale milestone, BlockDAG’s undervalued position offers immense growth potential, with projections of $30 by 2030 reinforcing its status as the premier crypto presale. BlockDAG’s ability to deliver high transaction speeds and seamless EVM compatibility establishes it as a forward-looking solution for blockchain’s future. BlockDAG is a cornerstone for those seeking stability and innovation.

Welch went viral earlier this year after using a ""hawk tuah"" onomatopoeia to describe a sexual act. ""Hawk Tuah"" quickly became a phase used for memes across social platforms — making Welch an overnight sensation from a minimum wage worker who didn’t even have an Instagram account.  As often happens with memes, ""hawk tuah"" has found its way to the blockchain. Welch’s HAWK token went live on Solana-based exchanges at 22:00 UTC on Wednesday in partnership with overHere, a token launchpad.  Minutes after HAWK began trading, its market cap soared to $491 million — and then it dove below $100 million.  Welch previously distributed free tokens to her social media followers and supporters within the meme and NFT communities during a campaign held from Nov. 26 to Dec. 2.  A statement shared with CoinDesk said Welch can't sell the HAWK tokens she got for one year and they will vest over three years.  ""Who doesn’t love a good meme?"" Welch said in a prepared statement. ""Becoming part of meme culture interested me in the world of crypto, and I've learned so much along the way. Launching my own token feels like the perfect next step — not just to create something meaningful for my fans but also to protect my community from scammers.""  HAWK is supported by a foundation in the Cayman Islands through complete legal compliance in the U.S. with hired directors on staff. It has raised money from a group of private non-U.S. investors at a $34.5 million initial valuation.  Celebrity tokens became a short-lived rage within the Solana ecosystem earlier this year, with several niche and forgotten media artists releasing their tokens using Pump.Fun during a frenzied period in May.  Most tokens ended up falling 99% in the days, or even hours, afterward.  But Welch's team says it is in it for the long run, hoping to build a community around the token and her fans in a bid to make it a successful project in the long term.  ""Launching the $HAWK token creates a fun, secure and innovative way for Haliey to get even closer to her community,"" Jonnie Forster, Welch’s manager, said in a statement. ""It not only empowers her fans but also eliminates the confusion posed by scammers who are constantly releasing unauthorized coins without approvals of her name and likeness.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | SOL,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/04/hawk-tuah-sensation-haliey-welch-s-hawk-token-goes-live,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/abf488531a45be16166c28118fe261a71a670bb4-1895x745.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

37226311,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622788,1733349604,Crypto YouTube hits a 12-month high at 4.72M weekly views as retail interest rekindles,"The crypto craze is returning to YouTube, with crypto content hitting 4.72 million views in the week of Nov 25-Dec 2nd. The viewership level marked a 12-month high, suggesting investors are regaining interest in cryptos. The rise in crypto content demand on YouTube indicates increased crypto smallholder participation. Besides, Phantom Wallet and Coinbase have bulldozed their way into the top 100 rankings on App stores, reinforcing the idea of growing interest from new market participants. Most crypto players are regaining confidence in digital assets, with new players being lured by the taste of earnings. While trading at $90,000 since November 11, Bitcoin’s stability might be responsible for increased retail activity, as the market is teasing the $100,000 milestone. Coin Bureau leads in YouTube weekly views Coin Bureau led the surge, with Crypto Banter taking second place in the same week. Both channels generated more than 1 million views within the week. Data Dash contributed the fewest views in the week, with only 12,520 views. The current weekly views remain far below the all-time high of 9.3 million, signaling a potential space for increased retail engagement. While crypto enthusiasts might link the surge in demand for crypto content on YouTube to heightened retail activity, this connection isn’t necessarily straightforward. Interpreting such trends requires a nuanced understanding of several contributing factors. YouTube views alone don’t guarantee consistent retail participation. Historically, social media engagement has sometimes acted as a lagging indicator of broader market trends. Additionally, the current 12-month high of 4.72 million views represents nearly 50% of the all-time peak, hinting that retail activity may still be gradually ramping up compared to previous market cycles. Crypto looks promising despite traditional finance making entries through ETFs Crypto content is gaining more ground, which is making analysts optimistic. Yet, the trend may represent a huge shift in market dynamics. Lately, traditional finance has been penetrating the crypto space strongly through ETFs and other investment channels. As a result, more diverse groups of retail users are finding their way within the space. The recent spike in social media engagement and crypto app downloading is a steady growth indication, unlike the surges caused by bull runs. This measured resurgence suggests a more sustainable comeback for the industry. Social media is critical in empowering and influencing crypto users, resulting in natural interest. On the other hand, increased downloads of crypto wallet apps show increased daily users. The shift appears to be gradual and more sustained from speculative frenzies.

Solana Set to Break Resistance: Potential Rally Towards $308 Ahead Solana's price is currently between $220 and $255, showing promising upward movement with a 37% increase over the past month. The nearest resistance is at $273. If it breaks this level, the price could rise towards the next resistance at $308, representing a potential gain of around 20%. The 10-day simple moving average is $225, which is approaching the 100-day average of $236. The relative strength index is at 51, leaving room for upward movement before reaching overbought conditions. With the approach of altcoin season and positive market sentiment, Solana might be poised for significant growth in the near future. XRP Surges Amid Bullish Momentum: Will It Break Through Resistance? XRP is trading between $1.60 and $2.67. In the past week, its price jumped by 91.25%. Over the last month, it soared by 429.90%. The nearest resistance is at $3.05, and support lies at $0.91. The 10-day simple moving average is $2.72, showing upward movement. The 100-day average is $2.06. The Relative Strength Index is at 61.47, indicating strong momentum but not yet overbought. The Stochastic is 57.02, supporting potential growth. The MACD level is 0.1136, suggesting bullish trends. If the momentum continues, XRP might test the second resistance at $4.12. This could mean significant gains from current levels. Conclusion While Solana and Ripple may offer less short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as a token for those seeking luxury and success. With an expected 700% growth by the end of its presale and potential for massive returns this altcoin season, DOGEN builds a community of leaders and provides real benefits for early adopters.

XYZ is currently undervalued, and with major listings on the way, presale participants stand to secure life-changing gains. >>>Don’t miss your shot at being part of the XYZ winning team! Cardano (ADA) Cardano is making waves in the cryptocurrency world with its native coin, ADA. Built for sustainability and scalability, Cardano is a blockchain platform designed to support smart contracts, enabling the creation of decentralized apps, tokens, and games. Unlike some other cryptocurrencies, Cardano uses an energy-efficient proof-of-stake mechanism called Ouroboros. This eco-friendly approach sets it apart from energy-intensive proof-of-work models used by platforms like Bitcoin. What makes Cardano unique is its innovative two-layer structure. The Cardano Settlement Layer handles transactions, while the Cardano Computing Layer manages smart contracts. This design aims to boost its processing capability, potentially reaching up to a million transactions per second with future developments like Hydra. Since introducing native tokens in March 2021, Cardano has enhanced its efficiency and scalability, offering secure and low-fee interactions with smart contracts. In the current market, where sustainability and scalability are highly valued, Cardano's ADA stands out as a strong contender alongside Ethereum's ETH. As environmental concerns and the need for faster transactions grow, ADA's unique features position it favorably in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Ondo (ONDO) Ondo Finance is making waves by combining the stability of traditional finance with the efficiency of blockchain technology. They turn real-world assets, like income-generating investments, into tokens on the blockchain. This means more people can access high-quality financial products that were once limited to a few. Ondo has two main parts: one creates these tokenized financial products, and the other builds decentralized finance protocols. Together, they aim to make finance more accessible and scalable for everyone. In today's market, where trust in cryptocurrencies can be shaky, Ondo stands out. They work with well-known partners like BlackRock and use Coinbase for secure storage of assets, emphasizing quality and security. Their focus on transparency and following regulations makes them appealing to cautious investors. A notable offering is USDY, which combines the stability of a regular currency with the benefits of blockchain, backed by US Treasuries and bank deposits. For investors looking for regulated and transparent options, Ondo offers a promising alternative. While many coins face ups and downs, Ondo's blend of real assets with blockchain technology might make it an attractive choice in the current market. Starknet (STRK) Starknet is changing how Ethereum works. It's a layer-2 solution that makes transactions faster and cheaper. Using a special technology called ""STARK,"" it processes transactions off the main Ethereum network. This means you can do more without slowing things down or paying high fees. They even have their own coding language, Cairo, which makes it easier for developers to build on Starknet. They've introduced the STRK token, which is used for fees, staking, and helping make decisions about the network. In today's market, Starknet stands out. As Ethereum users look for faster and more cost-effective options, Starknet offers a promising solution. The STRK token, launching officially in February 2024, could become important for anyone involved in Ethereum. With its focus on speed and efficiency, and backed by a strong team and solid funding, Starknet might be a good option to consider in the current crypto cycle. Compared to other coins aiming to improve Ethereum, Starknet's unique approach with STARK technology sets it apart. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a playful tribute to Dogecoin but quickly carved its own path. Launched in August 2020 by the mysterious Ryoshi, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain. This choice gives it access to Ethereum's vast ecosystem. Unlike Dogecoin, which runs on its own blockchain, SHIB can interact with Ethereum-based applications. It began with a staggering quadrillion tokens. Half of these were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, aiming to build trust. Buterin donated a large portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the supply, boosting SHIB's reputation. SHIB's integration with Ethereum opens doors to exciting developments. Projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, show SHIB's growing utility. Plans for an NFT platform and a community-led governance system highlight its potential. In the current market, SHIB stands out for its adaptability and community support. Compared to other meme coins, SHIB offers more than just hype. Its connection to Ethereum allows for innovation and new features. With market trends favoring platforms that offer real-world applications, SHIB could be an attractive option for those looking beyond traditional cryptocurrencies. Conclusion While ADA, ONDO, STRK, and SHIB are promising for 2025, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out as a pioneering all-sport memecoin targeting massive growth and uniting sports enthusiasts.

37225530,https://crypto.news/?p=14316318,1733348875,Brett trader predicts big gains for new trending meme coin in 2025,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Brett trader Austin Hill predicts explosive growth for Flockerz (FLOCK) as its presale attracts $4.3 million. Table of Contents Trader with Brett as favorite meme coin says don’t miss FLOCK The community rules in Flockerz Earn more by staking FLOCK Flockerz presale gets huge demand, $4.3 million raised A prominent meme coin trader with a strong conviction in Brett recently revealed his interest in Flockerz (FLOCK) . The project is currently undergoing a presale, offering a fresh opportunity for investors who missed the 470% gains that Brett has provided so far. Trader with Brett as favorite meme coin says don’t miss FLOCK Top crypto trader Austin Hilton recently told his 285k YouTube subscribers that he has “been a fan of Brett for a long time.” He explained that he was an early investor in the project and had “made a good amount of profit on it.” Hilton noted that he continues to hold his position because he thinks Brett could rise by 5x, 7x, or more this market cycle. However, in another video, Hilton underlined that Flockerz could offer a more attractive alternative. He hailed the project’s current early stage as giving it strong potential and said it “could do really, really well.” Looking at Hilton’s video, Flockerz is not trying to compete with Brett. It’s much more than a run-of-the-mill meme coin. The community rules in Flockerz A lot of people have forgotten about decentralization, the principle that crypto was built on. Meme coins are running to multi-billion market caps despite being controlled by self-appointed, centralized teams – it’s not exactly what Satoshi Nakamoto had in mind when he created Bitcoin. One of the reasons Austin Hilton likes Flockerz so much is because the community rules. It’s one of the first truly decentralized meme coins. The project will be controlled by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) comprising of FLOCK holders. They will get to vote on every decision relating to the project’s future, ensuring that it veers in a way that best serves the community and not just the team. In another industry-first, Flockerz DAO members will get paid for participating. It’s a mechanism hard-wired into the project’s code, and they’re calling it “Vote-to-Earn.” This concept is turning heads by strategically aligning the project’s success with user incentives. https://twitter.com/FlockerzToken/status/1859957512575009124 Earn more by staking FLOCK Voting is not the only way to earn with Flockerz . Users can also stake their FLOCK tokens to generate passive rewards over time. FLOCK staking is live amidst the token presale, and it currently provides a 560% APY, but this will decrease over time. Brett doesn’t have these utilities. On top of that, Flockerz boasts attractive artwork that can rival that of Brett or any other high-ranking meme coin. This is also seen on its social media, which posts uniquely hilarious and high-quality memes daily. The flocks always helping each other reach their goals! Teamwork makes the dream work! pic.twitter.com/Mk97zpMy37 — Flockerz (@FlockerzToken) December 2, 2024 Flockerz presale gets huge demand, $4.3 million raised As Austin Hilton and other top analysts take notice, investors are rallying behind Flockerz, hoping it’s the next breakout meme coin to rival Brett and other big names. The project’s ongoing presale has raised $4.3 million so far, a significant commitment from investors before the token is listed on exchanges. In addition to its promising use case, investors are drawn to FLOCK because the presale offers a discounted rate. It’s currently available at $0.0062245, but this will rise as the ICO advances. Prospective investors can buy FLOCK by visiting the project’s website, connecting their wallet, and choosing the amount they want to buy and the crypto they want to pay with. Alternatively, they can download the Best Wallet app and visit the “Upcoming Tokens” section. For more information on Flockerz, visit their website , X , or Telegram .

42415972,b7706385-3e93-4ade-988c-618243868b74,1733348782,"Ethereum's Justin Drake Sees No Threat From Solana, Says Its ‘Golden Era’ Will End","Ethereum developer Justin Drake said his comprehensive proposal to overhaul the second-largest blockchain's consensus layer isn't about catching up with a rival, it's about sticking around for the long haul.  Drake unveiled the proposal, known as the Beam Chain, at Ethereum's biennial Devcon gathering in Bangkok last month, at a time when the network's native token ETH is lagging behind its counterparts at other major layer-1 blockchains.  The Ethereum network enjoyed wide adoption over the last few years, making it more expensive and slower to use. In response, a cohort of layer-1s, known as “Ethereum killers,” emerged in 2020 to compete with Ethereum on transaction speeds, and Solana has been seen as the leader of the pack.  Recently, activity on Solana has exploded, mainly thanks to the surge of memecoins on the blockchain, with users wondering whether it will overtake Ethereum as the “hot” chain.  But Drake said he doesn’t see Solana as a threat to Ethereum. Neither does he see the Beam Chain as a way to restore Ethereum’s edge in the short term.  The Beam Chain “is all about improving the long-term health and security of the consensus layer, it has nothing to do with performance,” Drake said in an interview with CoinDesk.  “Solana has no consideration for health. The only thing they care about is performance. They care about reducing latency and increasing throughput,” Drake added.  Ethereum has tried to address the scalability challenge, by pushing forward a rollup-centric roadmap, meaning users can transact faster and more cheaply on a bunch of auxiliary networks, known as layer-2s or rollups. Popular layer-2s on top of Ethereum include Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and ZKsync.  Ethereum developers have heavily relied on the layer-2s to offer faster and lower transaction fees.  “I think the layer-1 is competing with Bitcoin, and the layer-2s are competing with Solana. And so it's not even part of the remit of the layer-1 to even compete with Solana,"" Drake said. ""We should be competing on security and health. And so if there's any competition to Solana, it needs to come from the applications and from the layer-2s.”  Arbitrum for example, has a slot time, or time between blocks of transactions being published to the chain, of 250 milliseconds. ""That is faster than Solana,” Drake said. (According to a recent research report from Galaxy Digital, ""Solana targets slot times of 400 milliseconds, though they typically range from 500-600ms in practice."")  Drake did add, though, that there are some features for Ethereum's layer-1 that developers have worked on that will make Ethereum more competitive on speed with Solana.   The main ones are “pre-confirmations,” which speed up the confirmation of transactions and are supposed to make the user experience on Ethereum as smooth as Solana's, as well as “blobs,” a feature that allows Ethereum to process large batches of transaction data off-chain. But these are all separate from the Beam Chain, which Drake has said he is hoping to implement by 2029.  And while Solana is seeing a lot of momentum, Drake said he is tuning out the noise to focus on long-term gains for Ethereum.  “Solana is having its moment right now, but I think it's going to be the end of the Solana golden era, because all of the competitive advantages that Solana has around latency and throughput are going to melt away because of fundamental differences in architecture that don't make it scalable,” Drake said.  A Solana spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment by press time.  Ultimately Drake said, his North Star is to create an “internet of value,” and the Beam Chain is what he thinks is needed to achieve that.  “We need a super-secure, incredibly neutral layer-1 and then we need a very rich and vibrant ecosystem of layer-2s that bring the application to the users,” he said.

Dogecoin: From Meme to Market Contender in the Crypto World Dogecoin (DOGE) started in 2013 as a humorous take on cryptocurrencies, featuring a Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin's limited supply, Dogecoin has no maximum limit and introduces 10,000 new coins every minute. Initially seen as a ""memecoin,"" Dogecoin gained serious traction in 2021, reaching a market cap over $50 billion and entering the top ten cryptocurrencies. This growth was driven by social media buzz, especially from figures like Elon Musk, and the overall rise in the crypto market. Its design allows for fast and low-cost transactions, which may be useful for everyday payments. With strong community support and increased visibility, Dogecoin's potential during the current market cycle remains significant. Conclusion While coins like DOGE show less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the leading meme coin, aiming to bring financial freedom to all.

After briefly dipping below $95,000 around midday, BTC later jumped nearly 5%, hitting a $99,177 session high, CoinDesk data shows. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was up 3.2% in the past 24 hours, outperforming the broader market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index's 1.3% gain.  The price action happened as the so-called ""Coinbase Premium,"" a key metric to gauge BTC demand among U.S. investors, spiked to rarely seen highs.  TradingView data shows that BTC was at times over $300 pricier on Coinbase relative to Binance during the price surge, suggesting that the rally was perhaps driven by strong demand by American market participants.  The Coinbase Premium measures the price difference for spot BTC on Coinbase, widely used by U.S. customers and many institutional market participants, compared to prices on offshore Binance, the leading exchange by trading volume that's popular among retail users.  The rally happened after — although likely not because of — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell compared bitcoin to a digital version of gold and a competitor of the precious metal during an appearance at the New York Times DealBook event on Wednesday. Prices also jumped as Donald Trump nominated Paul Atkins, who is viewed as being friendly to crypto, to run the Securities and Exchange Commission.

It was created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz. XRP is designed to be fast, low-cost, and open. It allows for borderless transactions that are resistant to censorship or counterfeiting. The system is decentralized, so there is no central authority. Transactions are irreversible and secure. XRP does not require a bank account for settlements. Ripple, the company initially called OpenCoin Inc., was gifted 80 billion XRP to improve the network and support the ecosystem. They placed 55 billion XRP in escrow to control the supply. In the current market cycle, XRP's technology shows potential due to its speed and low transaction costs. TRON (TRX): Empowering Content Creators with Decentralized Technology TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain platform launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation. It allows content creators to own their work fully and receive fair compensation. Originally based on Ethereum's ERC-20 tokens, TRX now runs on its own network. TRON supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), offering an alternative to Ethereum. The platform enables users to create and share content directly, without intermediaries like YouTube or Facebook. This direct interaction can lead to better rewards for creators. With its public ledger and transaction model similar to Bitcoin's UTXO, TRON aims to build a decentralized Internet. The technology has potential for growth as more developers and users adopt decentralized platforms. Conclusion Although XRP and TRX have seen significant rallies, their short-term potential seems limited. Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone. With a 700% ROI potential during its presale and triple utility features, it unites crypto enthusiasts to challenge toxic systems.

37225582,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622774,1733348448,"Trends in 2025: a16z predicts AI agents, crypto app stores and better prediction markets","The emerging trends of 2024 will turn into solid developments in the new year. Based on the preview by Andreessen Horowitz, or a16z, new developments will range from autonomous AI agents to crypto app stores and better prediction markets. The VC fund a16z predicts a lively crypto market in 2025, branching out into mainstream use cases and tapping the latest AI developments. In its latest market overview, a16z envisions the changes in the crypto space, building on recent trends and technologies. The list of developments is still in the ‘big ideas’ stage but may start to be implemented or discussed. The potential developments also suggest policies and regulations may shift for crypto space. AI agents to grow autonomous actions a16z predicts AI agents may be turned into autonomous actors on the blockchain, according to a16z partner Cara Wu . In the past three months, AI agents served as social media influencers and even built tokens based on their training data sets. Those agents were considered mostly experimental, and while some had their own wallets, they did not make trading decisions. The prediction for agentic AI comes just months after Marc Andreessen had his encounter with Truth Terminal, who convinced him to donate $50K in BTC for trading and development purposes. Truth Terminal does not stop in its attempts to talk to real-world people, recently tagging Elon Musk on X. The AI trend may be extended by autonomous decentralized chatbots, in the prediction of Daren Matsuoka from Farcaster. The AI technology and bots will go hand-in-hand with technologies for verifying personhood and original content, believes Eddy Lazarin, CTO at a16z. This technology is already proposed by Worldcoin (WCOIN) but may become more applicable in 2025. Prediction markets to evolve for wider data Prediction markets, especially Polymarket, had a field day with the US Presidential elections. The app and its informed participants were more accurate than polls in predicting the election outcome. In the coming year, the lessons learned may expand, believes Scott Kominers, researcher at a16z and market design professor at Harvard Business School. Kominers believes Polymarket had a lucky break, but users need special incentives to provide accurate predictions. Blockchains can implement such mechanisms to gauge sentiment and interpret the results in real time. Stablecoins and tokenization will expand After Stripe expanded its tools for stablecoin payments, more enterprises may follow. Sam Broner , an investor at a16z, believes stablecoins can add to cost savings and offer a fast, simple tool for receiving payments. With tighter regulations and growth of Circle USD (USDC), stablecoins can absorb a significant part of e-commerce payments. Broner expects stablecoin payments to spread to small businesses in the real world, replacing some credit card payments. Stablecoins can also be used for large-scale payments and institutional transfers, as they can carry millions at an extremely low cost. Stablecoins also go hand in hand with government notes. In the past few years, more stablecoin issuers added US T-bills as one of their main collaterals, chosen for its predictable earnings and liquidity. Governments themselves may try to put their bonds on the blockchain, believes CFTC commissioner Brian Quintenz . While governments adopt this aspect of crypto, there will be more regulations. The DAO, until recently mostly unaffected by regulations, will face a new standard for legal entities, a ‘decentralized unincorporated nonprofit association’. The DUNA standard can become a standard for startups in 2025, with its new regulated status. DAOs have faced problems with their approach, especially when trying to achieve fair governance with no legal resort. Miles Jennings , advisor at a16z, also believes political organizations can use the DUNA format and tap the power of DAO voting. Liquid democracy, or voting based on token ownership, will become a tool for decision-making and expand its potential in 2025. Andy Hall , professor of political economy, believes connectivity and blockchain records can increase the adoption of representative democracy. Other advisors of a16z point out that the rise of Web3 and previous projects have already expanded the crypto tech stack. New startups will build upon previous achievements, tapping the existing infrastructure for real Web3. One of the themes for 2025 will be to ‘hide the wires’ and not explicitly require users to engage with the blockchain, addresses, or self-custody wallets. As crypto matures, the next trend will be mainstream app stores, aggregating the best Web3 and mini apps. More projects may try to tap users with reliable apps. The end goal is to turn crypto owners into crypto users, encouraging spending and engagement, instead of passive holding. More use cases, such as tokenizing personal data or biometrics, may further grow the usage of the Web3 tech stack.

Doge Christmas (DOGECHRIS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGECHRIS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge Christmas can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Christmas could become the next viral memecoin. Doge Christmas launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge Christmas on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Christmas by entering its contract address – FJFMw9SQSGJV5jgjaJVFjwUczRmqrprP5UcwvntZ7JMx – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGECHRIS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/doge-christmas-dogechris-memecoin-will-explode-over-15000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Join the ‘Buy The Dips’ Movement with This New Ongoing Meme Coin Presale for Massive Gains,"Meme coins have reshaped the cryptocurrency landscape, capturing attention with their quirky branding and massive earning potential. From Dogecoin to Shiba Inu, these tokens have skyrocketed to fame, building tight-knit communities and producing staggering returns. The latest to ride the wave, DOGS, launched on the TON blockchain, has shown incredible growth, leveraging Telegram’s vast user base. But if you missed out on DOGS’ early days, don’t sweat it. A new contender, BTFD Coin ($BTFD) , is turning heads with its record-breaking presale and robust ecosystem. Positioned as a powerhouse in the meme coin category, BTFD offers innovative utilities like a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game and high-yield staking, attracting savvy investors and gamers alike. Let’s explore why BTFD Coin is the best new ongoing meme coin presale and how it compares to the popular DOGS token. BTFD Coin: The New Ongoing Meme Coin Presale You Can’t Miss BTFD Coin has quickly risen as a force to be reckoned with in the meme coin universe. Its presale success speaks volumes, with over $900,000 raised in just 10 days and over 21 billion tokens sold. Now in Stage 7 of its 16-stage journey, BTFD is creating serious buzz for its utility-packed ecosystem. Central to BTFD’s appeal is its P2E game, a gamified experience where players can earn crypto rewards while having fun. Imagine racking up tokens just by playing a game—this is where BTFD shines. The platform caters to everyone, from casual gamers to crypto enthusiasts, making it a perfect blend of entertainment and earning. Adding to its allure is BTFD’s staking programme. With an impressive 90% APY, it’s one of the most lucrative staking options in the meme coin market. This feature allows holders to grow their investment passively while supporting the coin’s ecosystem. BTFD’s community, known as the Bulls Squad, is another feather in its cap. This group isn’t just about memes; it’s a collective of investors, gamers, and crypto enthusiasts rallying behind the project. Their enthusiasm fuels BTFD’s momentum, making it a community-driven success story. The numbers don’t lie. Let’s break it down: if you invest $75,000 at the current presale price of $0.000064, you’ll receive 1,171,875,000 tokens. When BTFD hits its listing price of $0.0006, your investment could grow to a staggering $703,125. This is the kind of potential that makes BTFD the best new ongoing meme coin presale in the market. Why did this coin make it to this list? BTFD Coin combines innovation, high ROI potential, and community spirit, making it a must-watch in the meme coin space. DOGS: Telegram’s Meme Coin Champion DOGS exploded onto the scene as the meme coin tailored for Telegram’s massive user base. Its launch on the TON blockchain has been nothing short of extraordinary, attracting millions of users and securing its place among the top meme coins by market cap. What makes DOGS unique is its origin story. With its mascot, Spotty, designed by Telegram’s founder Pavel Durov, DOGS has a built-in cultural appeal. The coin’s massive airdrop during its launch saw over 17 million users claim tokens, setting a record in the meme coin world. Despite its initial success, DOGS has faced the challenges typical of meme coins, including market volatility. After debuting with an $865 million market cap, its valuation dipped to $557 million—a drop that highlights the risks associated with high-flying assets. However, DOGS continues to captivate investors. Its integration with Telegram, combined with the platform’s vast ecosystem, provides a unique edge. Analysts believe that as Telegram grows, DOGS could see renewed interest, potentially reclaiming its earlier highs. Why did this coin make it to this list? DOGS has proven its staying power with a strong community and innovative use of the TON blockchain, making it a notable player in the meme coin space. BTFD vs. DOGS: Which One Should You Pick? When comparing BTFD Coin and DOGS, it’s clear that both have their strengths. DOGS leverages its deep connection with Telegram to create a highly engaged user base, while BTFD stands out for its rich ecosystem and high ROI potential. The biggest differentiator is timing. While DOGS has already had its initial moment in the spotlight, BTFD is still in its presale phase, giving investors a chance to get in early and maximise their returns. With its P2E game and staking rewards, BTFD offers tangible utility that goes beyond mere speculation. Both coins are backed by passionate communities, but BTFD’s Bulls Squad brings a fresh energy that’s hard to ignore.

37225782,https://blockworks.co/news/grayscale-sol-etf-filing,1733347800,Grayscale excludes staking rewards as it joins SOL ETF filing fray,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . The crypto asset manager Grayscale joined the Solana ETF fray yesterday. NYSE Arca filed a 19b-4 form notifying the SEC that it hopes to list and trade shares of Grayscale’s existing Solana Trust. With Grayscale in, only BlackRock, Fidelity, ProShares and Ark are among the major crypto ETF issuers yet to file for Solana ETFs. But all these prospective Solana ETF issuers may have an achilles heel: The ETFs as currently proposed would not offer investors staking rewards. This omission isn’t necessarily by choice — SOL ETF issuers followed the precedent set by ether ETFs, which excluded staking rewards to comply with SEC guidelines. The details of the conversations between ether ETF issuers and the SEC remain unclear. However, it seems likely that the SEC had concerns about staking rewards being classified as securities and the potential slashing risks associated with staked ETH. So when firms started filing for Solana ETFs, they left staking out from the jump. Throughout Solana’s unfolding ETF saga, issuers have repeatedly told me that the benefits of getting regulated exposure to Solana’s price action directly in one’s brokerage account make the products attractive despite their lack of staking rewards. But the opportunity cost of cutting out staking is much higher for Solana than for Ethereum. Ethereum’s current staking APR is 3.4%, according to the Ethereum Foundation. Solana’s average staking APR over the past week has been 11.4%, according to data from 21.co. SOL’s staking reward isn’t always that high, but even in the relative doldrums of August it was yielding over 8%. The lack of staking rewards would leave SOL ETF buyers diluted by Solana inflation, which happens when validators receive tokens for running the blockchain. As Dan Smith explained on a recent episode of the Lightspeed podcast, those token emissions get passed onto Solana stakers via staking rewards, so only non-stakers lose value from SOL inflation. Leah Wald, CEO of Sol Strategies , said Solana’s appeal is broader than just staking yield, but noted that “staking is undeniably a value-add.” Sol Strategies , which is publicly traded in Canada, stakes Solana and runs a Solana validator. This could all change of course, since perhaps Donald Trump’s presumptive SEC chair nominee Paul Atkins will be more lenient on issuers and allow staking rewards to stand in applications. Todd Ruoff, CEO of decentralized AI shop Autonomys, said the Trump Administration is “likely to approve staking options in the near future.” There’s no guarantee of that happening, so in a sense, the current question on Solana ETFs is this: Will investors take a 10% lower return to get access to a regulated investment wrapper?

The first day of this year’s edition looked to dive deep into major topics that have impacted the ecosystem lately. It primarily focused on regulations, security, risks, and user awareness. The increasing focus on self-custodial wallets seems to become one of the major points of debate in response to hacks targeting custodial exchanges, with many advocating for users to control their private keys directly. The recently hacked crypto exchange WazirX is facing heavy backlash from users as the digital assets market keeps hitting the all-time high circuit. India to lead Web3 by 2028 Tak Lee, CEO of Hashed Emergent, delivered a powerful keynote on accelerating India’s digital renaissance. He suggested that the nation participates and leads in the global internet economy. It enables innovations by building ecosystems and consuming tech that vibrates worldwide. In a post, the Web3 venture capital firm mentioned that India’s demographic diversity drives scalable solutions through enduring habits. Urban areas focus on quality and convenience, and emerging regions on mobility and value. It highlighted that Web3 offers a major opportunity for Indian funds to get in line with global trends. On one hand, where international asset managers are reportedly allocating 1% to 6% of their portfolios to crypto, Indian VCs allocate less than 10%. This turns out that even a small portion of capital could unlock over $1 billion in investments in the next five years. The report recommends that India is emerging as a global hub for developers with a surge of 28% annually. The nation is ranked second in global open-source contributions and is on track to leave the US as the largest developer market by 2028. Its strategic value for Web3 is undeniable as in just two years, its share of global developers has doubled from 6% to 12%. Indian startups beating all odds Indian startups are thriving against all odds as they have showcased resilience and adaptability. May it be navigating through regulatory hurdles to achieve growth and legitimization, the region is setting new heights in the Web3 space, urged the report. Meanwhile, India’s regulatory approach has managed to strike the right balance. It looks to protect digital asset users and foster inclusive access to banking and fintech. The government is implementing tax policies that drive growth but with safety. As the event sets the stage for debate on clear regulations and security risks, the cumulative global crypto market cap surged by more than 4% over the last 24 hours to stand at $3.61 trillion. However, Bitcoin price is hovering around $99,000, building momentum to hit $100k.

Which Blockchain Powers Tomorrow’s Applications in December 2024?","Crypto enthusiasts are buzzing as Cosmos (ATOM) and Monero (XMR) dominate conversations with their latest developments. Cosmos has made a splash with Union Labs securing $12M in Series A funding, aiming to bridge Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Cosmos ecosystems. Meanwhile, Monero’s privacy tech remains a hot topic, with experts countering misunderstandings about its features in recent media coverage. While these two titans refine their niches, a new player—Qubetics ($TICS)—is stealing the spotlight. Currently in Presale Phase 11, Qubetics isn’t just another crypto; it’s solving problems that its predecessors haven’t tackled. With a No KYC, Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet , seamless fiat conversions, and deep integration with Apple Pay, Qubetics is all about simplifying crypto for real-world use. With presale tokens priced at $0.0282 and the potential for a 900% ROI, let’s dive into why these three cryptos are the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): Usability Redefined for the Modern World Qubetics is here to fix crypto’s usability problem. Right now, 266 million tokens are already sold in the presale, with $4.3 million raised and counting. At $0.0282, the current price offers early investors a golden opportunity before the next 10% hike kicks in. After presale, the price is set to hit $0.25, a staggering 900% ROI potential. But Qubetics isn’t just about numbers. Imagine you’re a small business owner—a local florist, for example—looking to accept crypto payments. Normally, you’d worry about wild price swings. Qubetics’ smart contract conversion mechanism solves that, converting crypto into fiat at the point of sale. Add its No KYC wallet for quick, hassle-free onboarding, and you’ve got a tool built for efficiency. For individuals, the wallet’s integration with Apple Pay and Google Pay makes it seamless to spend crypto like cash . Whether you’re a freelancer managing international clients or a college student splitting rent with friends, Qubetics makes it ridiculously easy. That’s why it’s one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024—it’s not just a token; it’s a game-changer. Cosmos (ATOM): The Internet of Blockchains Cosmos is a project with a bold vision: connecting blockchains for seamless interoperability. Its recent collaboration with Union Labs, backed by $12M in funding, underscores its role as a key player in linking Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Cosmos networks. If blockchain ecosystems are highways, Cosmos is building the bridges that let them talk to each other. Why is Cosmos one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024? Its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol has been a game-changer, enabling data and token transfers across chains. This tech is invaluable for developers creating decentralized apps (dApps) that need to interact with multiple ecosystems. From an investment perspective, Cosmos offers steady growth potential. Trading around $10.50, analysts expect ATOM to climb to $15 by year’s end as its ecosystem expands. Plus, its focus on energy efficiency and scalability aligns with the broader market shift toward sustainable solutions. Whether you’re a DeFi enthusiast or a long-term investor, Cosmos delivers both innovation and reliability. Monero (XMR): The Privacy Pioneer Monero has always been the go-to for privacy-focused crypto users, and its importance hasn’t waned. Despite some media misconceptions recently addressed by experts, Monero remains the gold standard for anonymous transactions. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, Monero uses advanced cryptographic techniques to keep transactions private, making it a favorite for users who value confidentiality. Why does Monero make the list of best cryptos to buy in December 2024? In an era where data breaches and surveillance are rampant, Monero’s privacy features are more relevant than ever. It’s not just about anonymity; it’s about giving users control over their financial information. For example, a journalist working in a restrictive country could use Monero to receive payments without risking exposure. Monero’s price has been stable, hovering around $140, with analysts forecasting a potential climb to $175. Its strong community and continued development make it a reliable option for those who prioritize security over speculation. For anyone concerned about privacy in the digital age, Monero is a no-brainer. Choose the Blockchain That Powers Tomorrow Each of these cryptos brings something unique to the table. Qubetics is revolutionizing usability with its No KYC, fiat-compatible wallet, Cosmos is bridging the gaps between blockchains, and Monero is safeguarding financial privacy. Whether you’re into real-world applications, interoperability, or anonymity, these projects have you covered. December 2024 is shaping up to be a pivotal month for crypto, and these three tokens are leading the charge. If you’re looking to diversify your portfolio, now’s the time to act. The future of blockchain lies in projects that solve real-world problems and push boundaries. Qubetics ($TICS) is all about ease of use, Cosmos (ATOM) excels in connectivity, and Monero (XMR) offers unmatched privacy.

Here are Predictions,"The price of Ripple (XRP), the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, fell for the second day in a row, sapping the momentum of its impressive five-fold rise in the past month. Analysts Say XRP Rally Loss of Momentum May Be Due to South Korea Incidents The decline comes amid a broader downturn in the cryptocurrency market, exacerbated by political unrest in South Korea, where President Yoon Suk-yeol’s recent declaration of martial law has caused significant market turmoil. XRP fell 18% on Tuesday and another 8% today. While major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have largely recovered and Binance Coin (BNB) has hit a new all-time high, XRP remains in the red and is struggling to regain its momentum. XRP trading activity in South Korea has been on a spectacular run this week, outpacing the country’s exchange volume. On Monday, XRP trading volume on South Korea’s Upbit exchange alone reached $4.8 billion, more than the combined XRP trading volumes on Binance and Coinbase, according to CoinGecko data. Related News: Fresh News from South Korea Keeps Coming - Here's a Recap of All the Events Affecting the Bitcoin Price South Korea is a key market for XRP, accounting for more than a quarter of global trading volume on centralized exchanges in the past 24 hours. Crypto regulations that limit foreign access to South Korean exchanges have made domestic traders the driving force behind this activity. However, analysts remain uncertain about the extent of the impact of political unrest in South Korea on the price of XRP. “It’s probably not a coincidence that XRP has fallen a little bit during this period,” said Mena Theodorou, co-founder of crypto exchange Coinstash. “Whether we will see a further pullback or whether the uptrend will continue remains to be seen.” Beyond South Korea’s impact, the XRP price drop could also reflect a broader altcoin market rotation. Crypto research firm 10x Research noted that investor attention has shifted to other tokens, with Tron’s TRX emerging as the standout performer. TRX has surged an impressive 61% in the last 24 hours, reaching a new all-time high of $0.45. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Why Has the XRP Rally Lost Its Momentum?

Gautam Chhugani, the managing director of Bernstein’s global digital assets division, notes that Ethereum’s total supply has remained mostly stagnant since the network transitioned to proof-of-stake and adopted a burn mechanism. “Yet, Ethereum’s underlying transaction fees drive a steady yield of ~3% (in ETH terms) to Ethereum stakers. This keeps ~28% of ETH supply locked in staking contracts. Further, another ~10% of ETH remains locked in Deposit/Lending contracts on the blockchain and bridged to layer-2 chains. ~60% of ETH has not changed hands in the last year, showing [a] resilient investor base. This creates favorable demand-supply dynamics for ETH.” Secondly, Chhugani notes that Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been picking up momentum, which he says could further strengthen the asset’s demand-supply dynamics. The analyst also speculates that ETH ETFs could soon involve staking yield. “The ETH ETF approval excluded the ability of asset managers to offer the underlying ETH yield to ETH ETF holders, due to regulatory limitations. We believe under a new Trump 2.0 crypto-friendly SEC, ETH staking yield will likely be approved.” Lastly, Chhugani also notes that Ethereum’s blockchain activity is surging, noting the network still accounts for 63% of total value locked (TVL) in blockchains. TVL refers to the amount of capital deposited within a protocol’s smart contracts and is often used to gauge the health of a crypto ecosystem. The analyst acknowledges that Solana ( SOL ) has taken the lead in terms of retail users, but Ethereum remains ahead in terms of institutions. ETH is trading at $3,583 at time of writing.

Many new generative AI launches by Chinese companies are censoring sensitive or controversial topics. Analysts now see the problem in adapting the codes of Chinese AI models. The big question is will this create a conflict? China might be extending its censorship to AI China is known for three things—technology, workforce, and censorship. Reports highlight that China-based AI models have become the technology sector’s highlight due to their advanced coding and reasoning skills. However, according to a report by TechCrunch , the Chinese government might be controlling the responses of many of these open-source models. The paper said that these models censor controversial or sensitive topics. This censorship has raised concerns among many, including Clement Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, a major platform for hosting AI models. In a recent podcast, Delangue seemed concerned about the consequences of Western companies relying on Chinese-developed AI models. He pointed out that if you ask a Chinese AI model about events like Tiananmen Square, it will avoid the topic or provide a censored response, unlike models built in other countries. The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 were a pro-democracy movement in Beijing. However, it ended up in a violent military crackdown. Disproportionate AI growth across countries is a cause for concern Cryptopolitan reported on several generative AI models that have been launched recently. Alibaba’s QwQ-32B-Preview and DeepSeek’s R1-Lite-Preview were among the many names. In competition with OpenAI’s Sora, Tencent also reportedly launched an open-source text-to-video and video-to-video AI. We decided to test the claim to see if China-based AI honors the country’s “core socialist values.” First, we tested the unofficial demo of ChatGLM-6B on Hugging Face. The model was trained in English and Chinese on the machine learning and AI platform. On the question about PBC killing pro-democracy protest , the AI model did not respond. Then we turned to DeepSeek to ask about Tiananmen. The AI model known for its math skills, refused to answer. AI ChatGLM-6B’s response on Hugging Face DeepSeek’s generative AI response Delangue warned that if China becomes the global leader in AI, it could use its dominance to spread cultural and political values that may conflict with the Western world. He emphasized the importance of distributing AI development across multiple nations to prevent China or any single country from holding disproportionate power. Looking ahead, Delangue predicted that China could surpass other nations and become the leader in AI as early as 2025. In response, AI enthusiast @kimmonismus says that the claim is “ controversial .” While the commentator noted that the AI advancement in China is fast, @kimmonismus underlines that the US-imposed restrictions on exporting advanced semiconductor chips to China will eventually cause PBC’s progress in AI development to slow down. Considering the chips are essential for training and running sophisticated AI models, China might be looking dependent on other countries. “Yes, you can train twice as long (or longer) with older chips to get to the same level, but at some point, it will be difficult to keep up with the West if the Western chips become consistently better,” @kimmonismus said. Meanwhile, it is evident that the Chinese AI models are designed to comply with specific ethical and cultural guidelines or government-imposed restrictions. The differences in response between platforms could also depend on the hosting platform’s internal policies or the training data and constraints of the specific AI model being used .

To read full editions, subscribe . When Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong speaks, the crypto industry tends to listen. His recent X post reminded me of what Twisted Sister first sang out in 1984: “We’re not gonna take it anymore.” (I would only hear this years later, after my birth). If you didn’t see, here’s the post: We've let all the law firms we work with know, that if they hire anyone who committed these bad deeds in the (soon to be) prior administration, we will no longer be a client of theirs. Senior partners at these law firms seem unaware of the crypto industry's position on this.… https://t.co/k8R6NtfTV1 pic.twitter.com/RT0k408i9f — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) December 3, 2024 You see that Armstrong called out the hire of Gurbir Grewal, who had been the SEC’s enforcement division director since 2021. He departed the agency in October and later that month joined the litigation and arbitration group at Milbank LLP. The law firm stated in a news release that the commission brought more than 2,400 enforcement actions during Grewal’s tenure, including “more than 100 enforcement actions addressing noncompliance in the crypto space.” A Milbank spokesperson did not return my request for comment. Despite what the X post might suggest, a person familiar with the matter clarified that Milbank has never actually worked for Coinbase. You might remember too that McGuireWoods in August hired David Hirsch , ex-head of the SEC’s crypto assets and cyber unit. Coinbase’s relationship with that firm is unclear, and a McGuireWoods representative didn’t immediately comment. Armstrong’s post was meant to spark conversation and give some transparency about how the publicly traded crypto exchange is thinking about this. Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal told me that not all law firm leaders keep close tabs on crypto and might not understand how “deeply personal” the SEC’s enforcement actions felt to industry players. “This was more than just, we have a good-faith disagreement about the law, so let’s resolve this in an amicable way,” he said. “It has felt for three and a half years that this industry has been under attack [and] unfairly attacked.” Of course, companies can hire whoever they want. But the point is that so too can Coinbase (and others) choose who it works with. Armstrong’s post “did catch people’s attention in the big law world,” Grewal noted. We’ll see if it moves the needle at all in terms of who firms choose to hire. Either way, the message was sent. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

The platform now allows Chinese citizens to trade on its platform but has banned the trading of China’s digital Yuan This decision reflects both Bybit’s ongoing attempt to expand its user base and its careful navigation of China’s strict crypto regulations. Bybit Builds a VPN Bridge for Chinese Traders In 2023, Bybit announced it would let mainland Chinese users access its platform through VPNs. This is in response to the strong demand from crypto enthusiasts affected by Beijing’s strict regulations. Bybit’s CEO, Ben Zhou, explained that the risks of this move were deemed acceptable, given the global interest in digital assets. However, Bybit remains cautious while allowing VPN access to the platform. The exchange prohibited trading in Chinese yuan to avoid crossing regulatory boundaries. Zhou highlighted that the Chinese government’s concerns over capital outflows have shaped this decision. He emphasized that compliance with local regulations remains a priority. Bybit’s VPN will enable mainland users to bypass restrictions, though it has not significantly increased the number of new users from China. Nevertheless, the exchange has been focused on serving the overseas Chinese community, allowing registration with national IDs and passports. Even so, the lack of yuan trading remains a key limitation for users within China. Bybit Navigates China’s Crypto Ban and Hong Kong Ambitions Bybit’s careful positioning comes after China’s strict crackdown on crypto activities. While Hong Kong has pushed to develop its crypto ecosystem , mainland China has strictly banned crypto trading and mining operations . Bybit and other exchanges founded by mainland Chinese teams initially exited the mainland market in response to this regulatory environment. Despite the challenges, Bybit has rapidly ascended the ranks of global crypto exchanges. Its trading volume currently places it among the top three exchanges worldwide, just behind Binance and ahead of Coinbase. The exchange saw its user base triple from 20 million to nearly 60 million in just a year. This meteoric growth has positioned Bybit to capitalize on the opportunities left by the collapse of other major players, such as FTX. Bybit’s Future in Hong Kong Bybit’s attempts to re-enter Hong Kong’s regulated market have been calculated. In early 2024, the exchange applied for a license under the city’s new digital asset rules . However, the application was withdrawn in May due to a conflict with the compliance officer and restrictions on serving mainland Chinese customers. Undeterred, Bybit plans to reapply in early 2025. Zhou sees the license as a potential confidence booster to enhance the company’s global reputation and attract top talent. While Hong Kong’s small crypto market, its regulatory clarity offers promising opportunities for Bybit’s growth in Asia and beyond.

Robot Musk (MUSKROBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Robot Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Robot Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Robot Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Robot Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Robot Musk by entering its contract address – KuyNyMswF1p3jYpJwNCsfeM86pnhjMb6urb3EKyNVje – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

This upgrade is named after Matthew Plomin, a key member of the community and the co-founder of the Cardano USDM stablecoin. The Plomin hard fork, formerly known as Chang 2, is to occur at epoch 529, which is expected to start on the 20th of December, 2024. The date was announced by Intersect, a Cardano community entity that has been involved in coordinating the upgrade. Plan 529 describes the process for the mainnet hard fork and raises an action for governance. This includes making sure that all the stakeholders are prepared for the change and the technical aspects of the change. The first implementation of the Plomin hard fork is scheduled for January 4, 2025. This timeline prevents interference with holiday time frames and provides ecosystem stakeholders with time to prepare. The Cardano hard fork working group also stressed the need to make adequate preparations in order to avoid common mishaps that often occur during the process. This way, the community gets enough time to prepare for the changes necessary for the upgrade of the system. The governance actions will adhere to the bootstrap governance of Cardano, which means that SPOs and the ICC will have the voting rights for the ratification. The final implementation may take place between January 4 and January 29, 2025. This will solely depend on the results of the voting and the operational conditions. Besides Plan 529, a minor node release, version 10.1.3, has been released to fix certain problems, including solving Issue #4772. The update shows that Cardano is keen on ensuring that its network is stable in the course of the hard fork. Cardano’s Hydra protocol achieves record high This news comes as Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, pointed out strong performance metrics during the recent testing of the Hydra Head protocol. The load test was aimed at understanding the maximum throughput o f the Cardano blockchain and was able to process a staggering 134,464 TPS. This is way above its normal 257 TPS throughput rate. The Hydra Head protocol proposed by Input Output Global (IOG) is one of the most important solutions. It focuses on increasing Cardano’s transaction speed and capacity. It also deploys the latest layer-2 technology to accommodate high-traffic applications like gaming. The native token of the Cardano ecosystem, ADA, has been on the rise, following the general upward trend of the current bull market. ADA rose 2% in the last 24 hours to trade at $1.21, with the intraday range being a low of $1.1 and a high of $1.24. During the last 7 days, ADA has increased by 16%, and the monthly increase is 267.31%. The cryptocurrency is now trying to regain its all-time high of $3.10.

Table of Contents Dogecoin’s $10 billion volume IntelMarkets: Where flexibility meets power Meme coins are proving their strength, and Dogecoin (DOGE) is leading the charge. With its trading volume skyrocketing to an impressive $10 billion, it’s clear that the meme coin craze is not over. While DOGE shines, IntelMarkets is taking the crown for weekly gains, showing it’s not just about fun and memes even while still in its presale. Dogecoin’s $10 billion volume Dogecoin is showing remarkable strength, with its 24-hour trading volume recently hitting a staggering $10.37 billion, a 67.67% increase. This surge in volume reflects the growing enthusiasm around meme coins, which has now surpassed Porsche’s market cap at $58 billion. Volume increases signal strong market participation, highlighting DOGE’s role as a dominant player in the crypto space. However, Dogecoin’s momentum appears to be waning. The Ichimoku Cloud and DMI indicators suggest a consolidation phase, with Dogecoin trading near key support levels. The price action is currently fluctuating within the cloud, signaling uncertainty in market direction. A break above the $0.48 resistance could propel DOGE toward $0.50-$0.60 while failure to hold the $0.36 support might lead to a sharp decline. The EMA lines also indicate a weakening trend. The potential formation of a death cross suggests that bullish momentum may be losing strength. A sharp reversal could happen if Dogecoin falls below the critical $0.36 support, possibly pushing it down to as low as $0.14.

While ADA is an established altcoin, DTX is a phase six presale star recently listed on CoinMarketCap.

ProfessorAstrones: Dogecoin price may hit $3–5 Dogecoin is one of the best cryptos right now, with data showing that its price increased over 170% in the past month alone. At that time, its value moved between $0.15 and $0.41, with its market cap soaring from $22B to $61B. Crypto analyst ProfessorAstrones recently made a bold Dogecoin price forecast.

42388960,27c7d808-ab92-40e0-8945-aaabd1025e4a,1733344458,Why Corporates Will Default to Public Chains in the Future,"For the last decade, financial institutions have defaulted to closed, private blockchains for digital assets over open, permissionless systems. Many, if not most of the world’s biggest banks and financial institutions have invested in, and tested out digital assets on private, permissioned blockchain networks. None of them have achieved traction with customers, businesses or institutional investors.    A key argument that financial institutions have made for prioritizing these efforts over putting assets on public blockchains is that regulators and regulations strongly prefer, and in some cases, specifically require permissioned blockchains. I believe that time is coming to an end.    The “default” regulatory perspective is going to evolve much more over the coming years. Though it might be hard to see now, I believe we’re not far from a time when regulators will look on with suspicion not at putting assets on a public chain, but keeping them on private networks.    Three factors will drive this change.    Liquidity matters    First and most importantly, liquidity matters. Public networks like Ethereum have millions (soon billions) of users and will hold hundreds of billions (soon to be trillions) in capital. Digital assets trading on Ethereum get the benefit of all those customers with capital to invest. Like big, public stock markets, the more buyers and sellers there are in a market, the more likely it is that your product will be priced fairly and find buyers willing to pay a fair price.    Digital assets that are only bought and sold on private networks may not get the same fair pricing opportunities. Indeed, I am already aware of at least one case where a real-world asset, tokenized and launched on a private network, has fallen below its net asset value in price. This could, of course, represent a reasonable expectation that the asset’s underlying value is set to further decline, but it could also be an indicator that the private network doesn’t have a robust group of buyers who would normally snap-up such deals.    I don’t think it will be long before the first angry customer with an underperforming token and no buyers complains to a regulator about that financial entity. They will claim that in selling them as an asset only tradeable on a private network, they were not treated fairly.    Evolving technological maturity and resilience    The second big driver that will transform how regulators look at public networks is their evolving technological maturity and resilience. Not only have permissioned systems not really achieved take off, but their evolution has also been relatively slow, and the offerings developed relatively few. The most ambitious permissioned systems today have less than a dozen products and many that are in production have only a few users. The lack of privacy in blockchains means that many permissioned systems have only one entity that can directly access the chain and all the others must access the network through restricted APIs.    Compare this to public blockchains. Ethereum alone has several hundred thousand smart contracts, nearly 3,000 operational protocols, and is processing several trillion dollars a year in payments and asset transfers. The Ethereum ecosystem is going through a substantial hard fork every 3-6 months and its overall capacity has risen from about a million transactions a day by itself, to hundreds of millions a day through more than 50 layer 2 networks and dozens of independent analytics vendors, compliance providers, and auditors. This is more than an order of magnitude bigger than any permissioned blockchain.    Regulatory acceptance of public blockchain ecosystem    Lastly, as regulators accept more and more frameworks and infrastructure for cryptocurrency, they will be forced to accept that the same Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) rules that work for selling and transferring cryptocurrencies can work for stablecoins and other digital assets. Crypto exists only on public networks and its widespread acceptance around the world has blazed a trail for digital assets of all kinds.    Regulations like the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) is a good example of where things are headed. MiCA was developed with knowledge of public networks in mind and while it does not require them, it has unlocked a wave of investment and innovation among Europe’s banks in public blockchain systems.    Bottom line: the advantages that digital assets on private networks have had with regard to regulator comfort and compliance are eroding, if they have not eroded entirely yet.    We have already reached the point in many parts of the world that regulators are not systematically blocking offerings simply because they will be on public networks. Sooner or later, they will take one step further and start asking anyone trying to offer assets on a private network just what it is they think they are doing. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

Interestingly, technical analysis shows that this consolidation is part of a bullish pennant that has been in formation since early November. Particularly, Dogecoin is currently in the flag phase of the bullish pennant formation, which is known to be the consoldation phase before the next leg up. According to Crypto analyst KrissPax, this Dogecoin price movement is creating a “great springboard for the next big Doge pump.” Dogecoin’s Sideways Trading Forms The Foundation For Growth The Dogecoin price has been trading within range since it reached the $0.47 mark on November 23. This range has been highlighted by a key support level around $0.37 that prevented further declines on November 26. Crypto analyst KrissPax noted that this consolidation has held above support, which he interprets as constructive rather than negative. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: Charting The Roadmap Of BTC To $150,000 By 2025 In terms of a Dogecoin price outlook, KrissPax highlighted that the consolidation has led to the formation of a bullish pennant, which is set to be broken at the upper trendline. For his price prediction, he highlighted the $1.3 level as the prime target after the breakout. The bullish pennant typically forms after a strong upward rally followed by consolidation, with price movements resembling a triangle. A breakout from this pattern often signals the continuation of the prior trend, making $1.30 a plausible target if the pattern holds true. The current Dogecoin sideways trading is holding support and making for a great springboard for the next big Doge pump. This bullish pennant targets a big move up to $1.30! Chart: Trader Tardigrade pic.twitter.com/cho062TLNU — KrissPax (@krisspax) December 3, 2024 What Could Drive The Dogecoin Price To $1.3? At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.419, according to CoinMarketCap, reflecting an impressive surge of about 178% over the past 30 days. Should Dogecoin manage to sustain its upward trajectory and achieve a breakout toward the $1.30 target, it would represent an additional 210% increase from its current price, as well as a decisive move beyond its all-time high of $0.7316. Related Reading: Cardano Next In Line After XRP? ADA Price Targets $4.88 In Epic Breakout However, the path to $1.30 depends on other market factors that extend beyond the bullish pennant pattern currently forming in Dogecoin’s price chart. Nonetheless, current market factors suggest that the meme coin’s price is still in a good position to keep growing. A key contributor to this outlook is the recent surge in activity on the Dogecoin blockchain, particularly among large holders. According to data from blockchain analytics firm Santiment, there has been a significant whale accumulation over the past several days. According to Santiment’s data, Dogecoin whales collectively acquired an additional 160 million $DOGE tokens within just 48 hours. This increase in demand could help sustain Dogecoin’s price rally and support its bid to surpass previous highs.

37223929,https://blockworks.co/news/trump-nominates-new-sec-chair,1733344200,Donald Trump nominates former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins to chair agency,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . After 16 years, Paul Atkins may be returning to the SEC. President-elect Donald Trump this afternoon officially named Atkins as his pick to chair the SEC. Atkins worked with SEC Chairs Richard C. Breeden and Arthur Levitt in the 1990s as chief of staff and counselor, respectively. He later served as an SEC commissioner from 2002 to 2008, beginning his term shortly after Enron’s accounting fraud scandal and leaving a month before Lehman Brothers collapsed. Since then, Atkins has worked as the CEO of his consulting firm, Patomak Global Partners. Its clients include banks, crypto companies and securities markets participants. Atkins is no stranger to Washington, or to the nomination process. It only takes a simple majority to confirm cabinet nominations , and with Republicans holding 53 Senate seats, Atkins should be a shoo-in. But I wouldn’t be surprised if Atkins faced some tough questions (likely mostly from Democrats) during his confirmation hearings about his private sector business interests — particularly those related to crypto. Why? Let’s rewind to 2022. Two years ago, thanks to a successful FOIA request from nonprofit whistleblower Empower Oversight, hundreds of emails between top SEC officials were released. Ripple, which at this point was about 16 months into its lawsuit with the SEC over the status of its XRP token, found these correspondences especially interesting. The emails, dated from May 2017 to December 2020, revealed that SEC officials were divided on which tokens violated securities laws, and which issuers should therefore be the targets of enforcement actions. They also highlighted a potential conflict of interest involving William Hinman, who served as director of the SEC’s division of corporation finance from May 2017 to December 2020. Hinman was prohibited from engaging in SEC matters that could impact his former employer, law firm Simpson Thatcher, in which Hinman still held a financial interest while he worked at the SEC. Simpson Thatcher had a financial interest in Ethereum, which was (and has been since) spared from an SEC enforcement action. I covered all of this in much more detail for Blockworks back in 2022. But the bottom line is these emails were embarrassing for the SEC, which fought to have them sealed in its case against Ripple. The documents ultimately brought context and transparency to the lawsuit, and while they weren’t enough to toss the case entirely, they did help Ripple secure its partial win in the summary judgment. So, given this history, I’d imagine certain senators — many of whom have advocated against perceived “pro-crypto” legislation in the past — will be interested to learn more about which companies Atkins has been involved with and what, if any, his financial exposure is. We’re months out from confirmation hearings, though. And Atkins has yet to make a public statement regarding his nomination (he also has not responded to Blockworks’ request for comment), so there is much more information to come.

BNB hit a $793 session high earlier Wednesday before paring some of the gains, breaking above the $700-$720 level that posed a resistance more than three years, TradingView data shows. The token recently changed hands at $730, still up 14% over the past 24 hours and outperforming BTC's 0.4% gain and the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index's 2.7% advance.  The action happened as bitcoin has stalled below the psychologically key $100,000 mark and traders rotated capital to smaller cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, to chase gains. Older cryptocurrencies with regulatory overhang including Ripple's XRP and TRX were among the biggest gainers over the past month as Donald Trump's election victory promises a friendlier regulatory environment towards digital assets.  BNB was originally launched by crypto exchange giant Binance in 2017 and powers the blockchain ecosystem BNB Chain, formerly known as Binance Smart Chain. It's also used as a utility token on Binance to pay transaction costs and receive discounts on trading fees.   The exchange's regulatory troubles weighed on BNB heavily through 2023: Even though crypto markets rebounded towards the year-end, BNB was still at near bear market lows around $200. These pressures have eased by now. Binance's founder and former CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao was released from prison in September after he pleaded guilty for violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and served a four-month sentence in the U.S. The exchange also significantly boosted its compliance department, CoinDesk reported last month.  The token is also benefitting from the exchange's quarterly token burning scheme, which regularly reduces the token's supply based on the BNB Chain's blockchain activity. Last month, Binance destroyed more than 1.7 million BNB tokens worth $1.07 billion at the time, the exchange reported.  User activity also rose in the BNB Chain ecosystem along with prices.

The second largest cryptocurrency’s price benefitted from $800 million worth of shorts closing their positions, according to Tom Dunleavy, a partner at venture studio Master Global. But it’s also profiting from a capital influx reminiscent of the 2021 bull market, CoinDesk Senior Analyst James Van Straten pointed out.  Bitcoin’s dominance peaked on Nov. 21 at 61.85% and has since slumped to 54.84%, Van Straten noted. Solana’s dominance has also tanked. “BTC has stayed flat, so ETH is playing catch up,” Van Straten said.  That also explains why so many coins in the CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins, memecoins, and exchange coins — are performing so well. While the index itself is only up 1.83% today (weighed down by bitcoin’s lackluster 1.52% gain), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Filecoin (IOU), Polkadot (DOT) and Uniswap (UNI) have surged 22%, 18%, 17% and 16% respectively over the past 24 hours.  Bitcoin did not strongly react to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments at The New York Times’ DealBook Summit. Powell only briefly touched on inflation, stating that the U.S. central bank can afford to act cautiously in its search for fiscal neutrality, before CNBC host Andrew Ross Sorkin asked him whether bitcoin’s rise was due to investor fears about the fate of the U.S. dollar.  “People use bitcoin as a speculative asset,” Powell said. “It’s like gold, only it’s virtual, it’s digital. People aren’t using it as a form of payment or as a store of value. It’s highly volatile. It’s not a competitor for the dollar, it’s really a competitor for gold.”  Powell further stated that when it came to the integration of crypto in the financial system, the priority was to safeguard the health and stability of the banking system, alongside consumer protection.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETC,BTC | ETC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Tom Carreras, James Van Straten, Krisztian Sandor",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/04/ether-rises-8-amid-slumping-bitcoin-dominance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be897c18f073d41e115d4c0ee46ca539dd17916f-1880x976.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The reason for the rise is thought to be Donald Trump's nomination of cryptocurrency-friendly Paul Atkins as SEC Chairman in the evening hours. In addition, FED Chairman Jerome Powell's continued dovishness in his speech also fueled the rise. In addition, the large amount of inflows into BlackRock's Bitcoin Spot ETFs also played a role in the rise. With the latest rise, the total appreciation rate in Bitcoin prices in the last 24 hours has exceeded 3%. Altcoins are experiencing higher increases. On the other hand, along with the rise, large liquidation waves were also observed in the cryptocurrency market in general. The cryptocurrency market experienced $440 million in liquidation in the last 24 hours, and the majority of $224 million of these were in long positions. The cryptocurrencies that were liquidated the most were Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP and Solana, respectively. *This is not investment advice.

37222988,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622720,1733343629,Donald Trump officially appoints pro-crypto Paul Atkins to replace Gary Gensler as SEC Chair,"U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has confirmed Paul Atkins, the highly ranked favorite to succeed Gary Gensler. The pro-crypto advocate has been appointed as the chairperson of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) during his presidency. It’s Official. President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday announced his new appointment for the role of new Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission following Gary Gensler’s resignation. Trump wrote on Truth Social, “I am delighted to announce the nomination of Paul Atkins to be the next Chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission.” He continued, “Paul is a proven leader for common-sense regulations. He believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors and that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World. He also recognizes that digital assets and other innovations are crucial to Making America greater than Ever Before.” Paul Atkins nomination According to reports, Trump’s transition team nominated Paul Atkins for the position following a two-day interview session on December 1st. One of the sources observed Atkins at Trump’s resort earlier this week. Atkins was regarded as a highly qualified candidate for the position because of his comprehension of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He served as a commissioner at the securities agency during George W. Bush’s presidency and as a staff member under two previous SEC chairmen. As investors were preparing for the next economic calendar under Trump or Kamala Harris, the crypto industry was expected to be among the most impacted industries. In particular, the SEC was expected to endure a significant transformation, as the new administration was expected to be more pro-crypto. Now, the long-awaited transition commences with Atkins’ appointment. Will Paul Atkins take up the role? Atkins has not officially accepted the position despite the fact that the transition team has reportedly nominated him to replace the current chairman of the U.S. SEC. Atkins was hesitant to accept the position . The position is not attractive due to the agency’s mismanagement under Gensler’s current leadership. The crypto entity also has very high expectations of him. Additionally, the newly selected SEC chairman was hesitant to give up his position as CEO at Patomak Global Partners, a corporation he established. Patomak is a consulting firm that specializes in regulatory compliance and risk management for insurance companies, banks, and crypto industries. According to the source, Atkins intends to depart from his current position at Patomak for an additional engagement only when the organization is fully independent. Atkins is expected to review many of Gensler’s rules and enforcement actions wending their way through the courts, adopt a softer touch on crypto, and pursue rule changes aimed at promoting capital formation. “His distinguished record, years of experience in the industry, and history of service at the SEC make him a supremely well-qualified nominee,” Eric Pan, the chief executive of investor lobby group the Investment Company Institute, told Reuters. What the new administration means to the crypto industry The crypto sector has been significantly challenged by government agencies in the United States over the past few years. There was an abundance of opposition to the expansion of these initiatives and companies, as lawsuits were common. However, analysts anticipated that this would undergo a significant transformation now that Trump has disclosed the new SEC chair. Trump’s administration also appears to have been persuaded that Atkins is the ideal candidate for the position. Atkins has been an enthusiastic supporter of crypto, providing testimony to Congress regarding its advantages. His presence should entirely alter the agency’s perspective. Furthermore, Paul Atkins’ presence could bring the nation one step closer to establishing its own strategic Bitcoin reserve. Certainly, Trump’s new administration’s anticipated comeback to the White House has driven Bitcoin to reach an impressive all-time high of $99,000. XRP also moved from under one dollar to an all-time high of $2.82.

Fifteen other members of the group received prison terms ranging from eight to 23 years and were collectively fined 16 million rubles worth around $150,000.The charges against them included the production and distribution of illegal drugs and psychotropic substances across Russia and Belarus from 2015 to 2018. Alleged Hydra Founder Sentenced to Life According to the update by the Moscow Prosecutor General’s Office, the group operated through encrypted online communication and covert drop-offs to facilitate drug trafficking on an industrial scale. Law enforcement dismantled their operation, seizing vast quantities of drugs, lab equipment, and vehicles adapted for smuggling. The court also confiscated the group’s vehicles, properties, and land for state benefit. Sentences are set to be served in strict-regime penal colonies, although appeals are expected. Founded in 2015, Hydra was a dark web marketplace catering to Russian-speaking users, offering illegal services such as drug trafficking, cryptocurrency laundering, currency exchanges, counterfeit document sales, and hacking tools. On April 5, 2022, US and German law enforcement agencies took down Hydra’s German-based servers and seized its cryptocurrency holdings. The platform, which had become the longest-running dark web marketplace, was valued at over $1.3 billion at the time of its closure. Although the founder’s identity is unknown, Russian media outlets TASS and Interfax have reported claims from anonymous law enforcement officials that Moiseyev was the mastermind behind Hydra. Post-Hydra: How Three Markets Gained Ground in 2022 Darknet revenue fell sharply in 2022 to $1.5 billion, nearly half of the $3.1 billion reported in 2021, following Hydra’s collapse. Hydra’s former users and vendors dispersed among new platforms, with OMG!OMG!, Blacksprut and Mega Darknet Market taking turns dominating the space. OMG gained traction immediately after Hydra’s shutdown but lost users to Blacksprut after a DDoS attack in June 2022. Blacksprut later suffered its own hack in November of the same year, driving more activity to Mega Market. Despite the competition, OMG remained the most active of the three for most of 2022.

Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-pepe-solana-memecoin-to-skyrocket-19000-ahead-of-first-exchange-listing-as-shib-and-dogecoin-drop/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37222161,https://crypto.news/?p=14316299,1733342506,President Trump confirms Paul Atkins as top pick for SEC chair,"U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has picked pro-crypto and former federal regulator Paul Atkins to serve as SEC chair. Paul Atkins, a one-time Commissioner at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, was nominated by President-elect Donald J. Trump to spearhead leadership at the securities agency. In a Dec. 4 Truth Social post, Trump wrote : “I am delighted to announce the nomination of Paul Atkins to be the next Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.” The President-elect described Atkins “a proven leader for common sense regulation”, reinforcing a plan to approach SEC regulation differently. Crypto supporter Paul Atkins Atkins started Patomak Global Partners in 2009 after a seven-year term as an SEC Commissioner under former President George W. Bush from 2002 to 2008. The consulting firm has crypto exchanges and decentralized finance operators as clients, according to Patomak’s official website. Trump reportedly offered Atkins the SEC chair role on Dec. 3. Shortly after, reports citing unnamed sources said Atkins was reluctant to lead the agency following Gary Gensler’s tenure. The nomination requires Senate confirmation before becoming official.

Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal expressed anticipation for the potential new SEC boss. Majority Whip Tom Emmer cheered the nomination while criticizing the SEC’s approach under outgoing chair Gary Gensler. Retiring House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry added that Atkin’s chairship will usher in “clarity for the digital asset ecosystem.” Gensler announced his intention to resign from the SEC on Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025. Paul Atkins has extensive public and private sector experience and understands that “regulation by enforcement” is a losing strategy that has crippled American innovation.

37222278,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622711,1733342433,Music Group Abba’s co-founder says ‘very unfair’ AI poses threat to artists revenue,"Björn Ulvaeus of the music group Abba has raised the alarm about the potential negative impact of AI on the income of musicians. He says tech companies training AI models on existing artists’ copyrighted body of work without remuneration is “very unfair.” He continued by calling for frameworks to protect artists and ensure fair compensation. The International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers (CISAC) backed up his claims. The association said generative AI would enrich tech companies while reducing the income for human creators. AI could potentially erode the revenue stream of creatives Swedish songwriter, singer, and president of CISAC, Björn Ulvaeus warns that AI is potentially siphoning a significant portion of creator earnings. This claim is substantiated by a CISAC economic study, which projects that music and audiovisual creators could respectively lose about 24% and 21% of their revenues to AI by 2028. According to CISAC’s study , creators could potentially lose up to €22 billion in 5 years, while generative AI providers could grow their revenue by approximately €9 billion by 2028. CISAC calls it “a transfer of economic value from creators to AI companies.” The imminent threat of economic value transfer from creators to AI companies led Björn and the CISAC to demand that policymakers come up with regulations to ensure creatives are protected and appropriately paid for their works. Despite his warnings, Björn isn’t completely against AI use. He said AI is the biggest revolution in the history of music and that his Abba music group would have used it in their creative process if the technology had been available in the 1970s. He added that AI can take an artist in “unexpected directions.” However, he stressed the fair use of AI to compensate creators for their work. Copyright concerns on the use of AI This year, Abba filed a lawsuit against two AI startups, Suno and Udio, claiming that they had ripped off the group’s classics to produce more songs. The lawsuit mentioned the AI-generated song “Prancing Queen,” which resembles Abba’s “Dancing Queen.” Björn says it is “very unfair” for AI companies to use an artist’s work without appropriate remuneration. Both companies denied the claim, arguing that their models generate entirely original works under fair use provisions of copyright law. Also, in April 2024, late rapper Tupac Shakur’s estate issued a cease-and-desist letter to rapper Drake, who released a track featuring an AI-generated Tupac . Government bodies are beginning to address the challenges AI poses with regard to copyright laws. The United Kingdom’s Intellectual Property Office in 2021 launched a consultation to examine the intersection of AI and intellectual property rights. The U.S. Copyright Office states that AI-generated works without human authorship don’t qualify for copyright protection. However, there is an ongoing debate about the use of copyrighted materials to generate new works. According to a U.S. Congressional Research Service report , to establish copyright infringement, a plaintiff must prove the infringer “actually copied” the underlying work. As Björn admits, AI use in the creative industry can improve creativity and productivity. However, the songwriter and the CISAC group he heads continue to advocate for clear frameworks to protect creators from the existential threats AI presents to the earning potential of creatives.

As major crypto assets like the Dogecoin price and XRP price struggle against significant resistance levels, this emerging project, PropiChain (PCHAIN) , is preparing for a 5000x run. Even amid renewed optimism in the broader crypto market, the Dogecoin price and XRP price struggling against key resistance levels have left traders eager for a potential breakout. However, PropiChain, a blockchain-powered real estate platform, is attracting massive attention from investors seeking the next big opportunity. According to top market analysts, PCHAIN is positioned as a potential disruptor in the real estate industry with its innovative use case and ambitious roadmap. As the prospect of PCHAIN’s massive 5000x price run gains momentum, early investors are closely watching its market movements and development milestones. As the Dogecoin price and XRP price face resistance, PCHAIN presents an exciting alternative for traders and investors to maximize the current crypto bull market. What are the factors driving the PropiChain price surge to a 5000x run? Let’s read on to find the answers we seek. The Dogecoin Price Face Resistance as PropiChain Sets for 5000x Run The Dogecoin price has been under pressure in recent weeks. Despite occasional bullish surges fueled by celebrity endorsements or social media buzz, the Dogecoin price struggled to maintain momentum. DOGE faces strong resistance around the $0.5 level, a psychological barrier it has repeatedly failed to break through. Several factors contribute to the Dogecoin price stagnant performance. Market sentiment around meme coins has cooled compared to the frenzy of 2021, and investors are increasingly seeking projects like PCHAIN with clear utility. That said, the Dogecoin price still holds potential as a community-driven token with a loyal following. A breakout above the $0.5 resistance level could set the stage for a more bullish scenario. However, such a move requires broader market optimism and renewed interest in speculative assets. While the Dogecoin price is battling resistance, PCHAIN has emerged as one of the top projects with its ambitious roadmap and potential for exponential growth. Market analysts have projected the token will deliver a 5000x run for early presale investors. PropiChain is a blockchain-based platform focused on real estate tokenization. It allows users to buy, sell, and trade fractional ownership in real-world properties. By combining blockchain’s transparency and efficiency with the $600-trillion real estate industry, PCHAIN is positioned for a potentially massive rally. What is Driving the PCHAIN Run to 5000x? Several factors fuel the PCHAIN 5000X run, such as the Dogecoin price and XRP price, which struggle with resistance levels. These factors include: Innovative Use Case Real estate tokenization is a growing trend, with the market projected to take the biggest share of the RWA tokenization market worth $16 trillion . With PCHAIN serving as a real-world asset (RWA) token and the utility token of the PropiChain, analysts strongly believe the token is set for a massive price rally. 600 Trillion Dollar Backing As an RWA token that bridges the gap between global real estate and blockchain, PCHAIN is backed by the world’s number one asset class: real estate, which is currently worth $600 trillion . This means the token is not susceptible to ongoing market volatility, and investors flock to it due to its high profit potential and presumed stability. Community Hype With a robust marketing campaign and active community engagement, PropiChain has attracted significant attention, positioning itself as a promising contender in the altcoin market. While the projected 5000x price increase for PCHAIN might appear too ambitious, a forecast based on the combination of limited token supply, high demand, and the size of the niche market is only a matter of time before it becomes a reality. Why the XRP Price is Battling Resistance Amid Broader Market Uptrend While PCHAIN is poised for a 5000x price rally, the XRP price has struggled with key resistance levels. Since the recent crypto market uptrend, the XRP price has been battling the $2.5 resistance level for months. The ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to overshadow the XRP price. Although Ripple secured a partial victory earlier this year, the legal uncertainty has deterred institutional investors, putting excessive pressure on the XRP price growth potential. PropiChain Redefining the Future of Real Estate Using Innovative Technologies PropiChain automates property leasing and lease renewals using smart contracts. This eliminates the reliance on leasing agents, giving property owners more control while reducing administrative delays. PCHAIN is revolutionizing property exploration by incorporating Metaverse technology. Through advanced 3D technology, the platform offers virtual property tours, allowing investors to experience and evaluate properties from anywhere in the world. This innovation reduces the need for physical site visits, simplifying the property-buying process and making it accessible to a global audience. Additionally, PCHAIN uses RWA tokenization technology to digitize real estate properties on the blockchain, enabling fractional ownership of real estate properties. This groundbreaking approach allows investors to purchase portions of premium properties instead of the entire property. It opens the market to a broader pool of participants and boosts market liquidity, making it easier to trade real estate assets seamlessly. The platform also uses AI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots to provide 24/7 support to investors, while predictive analytics tools provide comprehensive market forecasts, highlighting emerging investment opportunities. This combination of automation, virtual exploration, tokenization, and AI-driven tools positions PropiChain as a cutting-edge platform at the forefront of real estate innovation. Conclusion As the Dogecoin price and XRP price struggle with resistance levels, PCHAIN is offering investors the ideal alternative with a potential 5000x. At the current PCHAIN presale price of $0.004, if you invest $1000 in the project, you will earn a massive $50,000 profit. Now is the ideal time to join the PCHAIN presale , as the token price will rise by 175% and 475% for the second and third rounds. The token is listed on CoinMarketCap , showing that the project is ready to do big things in crypto. Additionally, one of the best blockchain security companies, BlockAudit , has audited the project’s smart contract and found no vulnerability.

37223178,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51373,1733342424,"Interested in Significant Gains? Find Out Why BlockDAG, Bitcoin, Ripple & Solana Are Must-Buys This Week!","Selecting the right cryptocurrency for investment can be daunting due to the plethora of choices. The market offers many opportunities, but cryptocurrencies differ greatly in their offerings. For those aiming to make sound investments, both short-term and long-term, focusing on cryptocurrencies that have shown consistent technological innovation and reliable returns is crucial. This overview introduces four cryptocurrencies that stand out currently: from BlockDAG’s emerging capabilities to Bitcoin’s established reliability. Read on to discover the unique advantages of each. 1. BlockDAG: A Leading Innovator in Blockchain Technology BlockDAG is quickly gaining traction as a standout blockchain platform. It departs from traditional blockchain structures by implementing Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, enabling quicker and more scalable transactions. This forward-thinking approach allows BlockDAG to manage large transaction volumes efficiently, making it suitable for DeFi, NFTs, and meme coins applications. Priced at $0.0234, BlockDAG has successfully raised over $155 million in its presale, with 16.8 billion coins distributed. Early adopters have witnessed a remarkable 2,240% ROI. Forecasts suggest that BlockDAG could reach $1 by 2025, indicating substantial ROI potential. BlockDAG is a top pick for traders looking for either short-term benefits or long-term growth this week. 2. XRP: Reshaping Cross-Border Payments XRP is well-known for its potential to transform cross-border payments. It seeks to replace conventional banking systems like SWIFT with a faster, more cost-effective alternative, positioning it as a key player in international remittances. An expanding network of partnerships underscores XRP’s growth prospects. With XRP recently surpassing $1.5, it demonstrates strong market confidence, and as Ripple’s legal issues with the SEC possibly draw to a close, further growth could ensue. Price projections for XRP reach up to $3.84, with some estimates even suggesting a rise to $10. While its critical role in global payments highlights XRP as a top crypto to buy this week, its ongoing legal challenges might deter more cautious investors. 3. Bitcoin: The Gold Standard of Crypto Bitcoin (BTC) continues to be the benchmark in the crypto market. As the pioneering cryptocurrency, it has established itself as a reliable store of value and a defense against inflation. Although the major growth phases of Bitcoin are behind it, its ongoing dominance ensures it remains a secure investment choice. Recent developments, such as institutional adoption and increasing support for Bitcoin ETFs, further solidify its position as a dependable asset amidst market volatility. While it may not yield as high returns as some newer altcoins like BlockDAG, Bitcoin is still an excellent option for those seeking stability in their investments. 4. Solana: Pioneering Speed and Scalability Solana (SOL) has positioned itself as a leading force in blockchain technology, famed for its rapid transaction speeds and minimal fees. As a primary competitor to Ethereum in the dApp and NFT arenas, Solana is preferred by developers and traders seeking efficient alternatives. Despite facing challenges like network outages, Solana’s ecosystem is flourishing, driven by the rising popularity of meme coins and decentralized finance initiatives. While Solana presents an enticing growth narrative, its volatility and historical technical issues may pose risks for some investors. The Top Cryptos to Buy This Week This week’s top cryptocurrency picks each offer unique strengths, catering to varied investor needs. Bitcoin provides stability and steady growth as a market leader, while XRP presents promising growth potential in global payment solutions. Solana stands out for those interested in capitalizing on the expanding demand for dApps, given its notable speed and scalability. Meanwhile, BlockDAG introduces a fresh technological spin to blockchain, harboring significant potential for both immediate and future gains. With BlockDAG still in its presale stage, now is an opportune moment to invest, anticipating substantial returns in the coming years.

37221942,https://crypto.news/?p=14316110,1733342082,Forbes 30 under 30 spotlights minds shaping crypto’s hype,"The 2024 Forbes 30 Under 30 list features young crypto founders creating platforms for finance, trading, and prediction markets, even with regulatory challenges. Forbes has unveiled its latest “30 Under 30” list for finance, revealing a new generation of innovators in fintech and crypto. Among the honorees are blockchain entrepreneurs reshaping financial markets while navigating both successes and regulatory challenges. Crypto.news retells their journeys. Table of Contents Shayne Coplan: Betting big with crypto Cindy Leow: Perpetual trading powerhouse Kaledora Kiernan-Linn: From ballet to blockchain The bigger picture The road ahead Shayne Coplan: Betting big with crypto At just 26 years old, Shayne Coplan is the mastermind behind Polymarket , a blockchain-based prediction market that has processed billions of dollars in transactions this year alone, per data from Dune Analytics. The platform lets users bet on the outcomes of real-world events, like elections, sports games, or even extreme scenarios like nuclear weapon detonation. However, Polymarket didn’t achieve instant recognition or success. Launched in 2020, it took four years and tens of millions in funding from such backers as Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund and Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin for the platform to gain recognition. The turning point came during the 2024 U.S. presidential election, when its prediction markets signaled Donald Trump’s surprising victory. https://twitter.com/shayne_coplan/status/1863995659730190474 However, Polymarket hasn’t escaped controversy. Following allegations that the platform allowed U.S. users to bet illegally, the FBI raided Coplan’s residence just days after the election, reportedly seizing devices. This came despite Polymarket’s 2022 settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, where it paid $1.4 million in fines and agreed to bar U.S. users from using its platform. A spokesperson for Polymarket has hinted that the raid might have been politically motivated, though no charges have been filed to date, Forbes notes. Despite the scrutiny, Polymarket remains a pioneer in crowd-driven forecasting, showcasing the untapped potential of blockchain in creating decentralized markets. Cindy Leow: Perpetual trading powerhouse Cindy Leow, 27, is another rising star in crypto, transforming markets when she co-founded Drift in 2021, a Solana -based crypto exchange specializing in perpetuals — derivatives allowing traders to speculate on price movements without owning the underlying asset. https://twitter.com/DriftFDN/status/1862519400244683219 Backed by investors like Polychain Capital and Multicoin Capital, Drift — which facilitated billions in trading volume — Leow raised $42 million in funding for Drift, which she has parlayed into serious crypto clout. This year, Drift recorded $40 million in revenue and grew its user base to over 200,000, Forbes reports. Prior to Drift, Leow co-founded a $30 million quantitative hedge fund and worked at Softbank Ventures Korea, an early-stage venture capital arm of SoftBank Group. Despite its ambitious goals, the Solana-powered crypto exchange operates in a fiercely competitive market, facing ongoing regulatory scrutiny and challenges surrounding derivatives trading. Kaledora Kiernan-Linn: From ballet to blockchain At 28, Kaledora Kiernan-Linn has shifted her focus to new ventures. After a career as a professional ballet dancer, she graduated from Harvard with a neuroscience degree and co-founded Ostium Labs, the team behind the Ostium protocol, the first decentralized perpetuals exchange purpose-engineered for real-world assets. TRADE EVERYTHING. Live NOW pic.twitter.com/vekEyNOtzk — Ostium (@OstiumLabs) October 17, 2024 Alongside co-founder Marco Ribiero, Kiernan-Linn aims to integrate blockchain’s transparency with traditional commodity trading and financial indices. The final goal: to bridge decentralized technology and global finance. While still in its early stages, the startup secured $3.5 million in funding from such investors as General Catalyst, LocalGlobe, SIG, and Balaji Srinivasan, among others. The bigger picture The rising stars show how crypto is evolving beyond just being a speculative investment. Platforms like Polymarket and Drift show that blockchain technology is now at a point where it can seriously change markets and help manage risks. At the same time, Ostium Labs is demonstrating how blockchain can transform industries like commodities and global finance. However, these innovations haven’t come without challenges. From legal issues to technical difficulties, the entrepreneurs on Forbes’s list are dealing with a world full of risks. Polymarket’s legal problems , for example, highlight the difficult balance between pushing new ideas and following regulations, while Drift’s focus on derivatives is getting a lot of attention in a market that is still figuring out its rules. The road ahead As these young innovators push the limits, the future won’t be easy. The successes of Coplan, Leow, and Kiernan-Linn clearly show the potential of crypto to change the financial world. However, their stories also remind that the web3 industry is still in its early stages, especially when it comes to getting clear rules and regulations. Forbes says the winners were chosen from over 600 nominations and judged by four experts: Chris Britt, co-founder and CEO of neobank Chime; Marc Lasry, co-founder and CEO of Avenue Capital Group; Laura Spiekerman, co-founder of Alloy; and Nikil Viswanathan, co-founder of Alchemy, a blockchain infrastructure firm.

The volume of inflows nearly doubled the inflow registered on Monday, which stood at $353.7 million. BlackRock Leads the Charge in ETF Surge According to data from SoSoValue , the total net assets held by the various asset managers behind the U.S spot BTC ETF contracts have reached $104.25 billion. This represents approximately 1,076,609.7 BTC. This is about 23,391 BTC away from the estimated 1.1 million BTC held by wallets belonging to Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Leading the pack of asset holders is BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), with $693.25 million of net capital inflow on the trading day. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund followed with $52.17 million in inflows. Despite the massive inflow during trading, ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) lost $93.5 million in outflows on Tuesdays. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Invesco, Franklin, and Valkyrie recorded zero flow. Except for Franklin, this is the third consecutive day of no flows for Invesco, Franklin, and Valkyrie. Can ETF Surge Signal Broader Adoption The impressive performance of the ETF products pushed the November net inflow to $7.6 billion across the product market. This remarkable uptick has been attributed to Donald Trump’s recent victory in the U.S. election. Many analysts believe that Trump will adopt pro-crypto policies and regulations. This positivity has driven market confidence up a notch. Notably, institutional investors have become more attracted to the Bitcoin ETF. The growing interest in ETF products might trigger broader moves to other sectors. For instance, Tether has expanded its utility in the financial sector. As reported by TheCoinRise , Tether made history when it funded a $45 million crude oil transaction in October 2024. Global Confidence in Bitcoin ETF Products Grows Aside from the U.S. market, three Bitcoin spot ETF products on the Stock exchange (HKEX) set a new market record in Hong Kong. The trio registered a monthly trading volume of $154 million or 1.2 billion HKD in November 2024. They include ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF, Bosera Hashkey BTC ETF, and Harvest Bitcoin Spot ETF. This signals the rising confidence and interest in Bitcoin-related products in the United States and globally. Some analysts anticipate more utility for BTC ETF as adoption increases.

With their unique blend of community-driven hype and the potential for substantial returns, meme coins are more than just a fad—they’re becoming a staple in many investors’ portfolios. BTFD Coin is setting the stage to take this popularity to new heights with its innovative play-to-earn (P2E) game, attractive staking rewards, and a vibrant community. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is not just another meme coin; it’s a game changer in the space. Launched on November 26, 2024, its presale has already made waves, attracting significant attention from crypto enthusiasts eager to get in on the ground floor. With its presale price starting at just $0.000004 per coin and an anticipated post-presale listing at $0.0006, the potential for profit is massive. As the presale heats up, BTFD is poised to become one of the best meme coins to buy and hold for long term investment, offering unique features that set it apart from its competitors. In this article, we’ll dive deep into three standout meme coins: BTFD Coin, Dogecoin, and Floki Inu. Each of these projects has its own unique charm and potential for growth. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a newbie looking to dip your toes into the meme coin craze, understanding these coins can help you make informed decisions. So, let’s explore why these coins could be the best meme coins to buy and hold for long term gains. BTFD Coin: The Next Big Thing in Meme Coins BTFD Coin is making waves with its presale, already raising over $900,000 and selling more than 21 billion coins. Currently in its seventh stage, the presale has shown impressive momentum, with 2,000 holders already on board. It’s not just about the numbers, though; BTFD Coin is backed by a strong community and innovative features that could redefine the meme coin landscape. One of the standout aspects of BTFD Coin is its play-to-earn gaming model, which allows users to earn rewards while having fun. This is a game-changer in the meme coin arena, as it adds utility beyond just holding coins. The staking rewards further incentivise users to hold onto their coins, ensuring that BTFD isn’t just a fleeting trend but a long-term investment opportunity. Let’s talk numbers. If you invested $4,000 during Stage 5 when the price was $0.00005 per coin, you’d have snagged 80 million BTFD coins.

As the presale progresses through its 16 stages, each stage generates more excitement and urgency among potential investors. In the first 24 hours, BTFD Coin surged to its fourth stage—an impressive feat that showcases the demand and confidence in this new project. With analysts predicting even more price appreciation, now’s the time to jump on the BTFD bandwagon. Dogecoin: The Original Meme Coin Steadies Ahead of Updates Dogecoin has been around since 2013, and let’s be real—it’s the granddaddy of meme coins. Originally launched as a joke, it’s morphed into a legitimate investment asset, thanks to its passionate community and widespread recognition. As we look ahead to 2025, Dogecoin continues to hold its ground with exciting updates on the horizon. One of the most appealing aspects of Dogecoin is its stability compared to newer meme coins. While BTFD Coin is heating up, Dogecoin offers a sense of security for investors looking for long-term holds. Recent updates hint at potential partnerships and integrations in the broader crypto ecosystem, which could enhance its utility and further cement its position as one of the best meme coins to buy and hold for long term. The community behind Dogecoin is its lifeblood. From charitable initiatives to fun events, the Dogecoin community embraces a culture of positivity and inclusivity.

Moreover, with the anticipated updates, analysts speculate that Dogecoin could see a price surge. If you’re considering the best meme coins to buy and hold for long term, Dogecoin remains a frontrunner. Its established track record, coupled with ongoing developments, makes it a compelling option for both new and seasoned investors. Floki Inu: A Rising Star with Ambitious Goals Floki Inu has quickly become a fan-favourite in the meme coin universe, boasting a vibrant community and ambitious plans for the future. Inspired by Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu dog, Floki has taken the crypto world by storm, and its growth trajectory shows no signs of slowing down. What sets Floki Inu apart is its focus on creating real-world utility through partnerships and projects. The team behind Floki is not just about memes; they’re committed to developing a strong ecosystem that includes NFTs, DeFi applications, and even educational initiatives. This approach is refreshing in the meme coin space, where many projects often lack a clear purpose beyond hype. As Floki Inu eyes new partnerships, the potential for growth is substantial. These collaborations could introduce Floki to a broader audience, enhancing its recognition and driving demand.

Ver, an early investor of Bitcoin ( BTC ) who later decided to support the BCH fork, was arrested in Spain in late April at the direction of the Department of Justice (DOJ). Ver faces multiple charges, including mail fraud, tax evasion and filing false tax returns. Despite renouncing his United States citizenship in 2014 after obtaining citizenship in Saint Kitts and Nevis, authorities say Ver should’ve filed tax returns that reported capital gains from the sale of his worldwide assets, including his Bitcoin, and reported the fair market value of his assets – essentially paying an exit tax. Now, lawyers for Ver are asking the court to dismiss the indictment, citing government overreach. Ver tells FOX Business that by including his correspondence with attorneys in the most recent court filing, he hopes to provide the rationale for his actions and show the public and the Trump administration that he was not trying to flout the law as authorities allege. Says Ver, “I always knew I’d be a political target for the IRS and law enforcement after I expatriated… That’s why I made sure to hire the most reputable attorneys and accountants and gave them clear instructions to file everything perfectly — so there’d be no issues when the inevitable audit came. But of course, the IRS still found a way to make it a problem anyhow.” Lawyers also note that laws and regulations surrounding cryptocurrencies were convoluted and nearly non-existent at the time of Ver’s alleged offense. Say the lawyers, “The government’s charges against Roger Ver rely on violations of his rights; misleading, selective quotations of communications presented to the grand jury; and, fundamentally, on the false and anachronistic pretense that U.S. tax rules provided meaningful guidance to those who, like Ver, were among the pioneers in the now-mainstream cryptocurrency economy.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

37221513,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622704,1733340919,Vestra DAO (VSTR) smart contract exploited less than a month after its launch,"Vestra DAO appears to have been hacked. On-chain analysts noted suspicious activity where VSTR tokens, the protocol’s native ERC-20 token, were being moved from available smart contracts and immediately sent to the Tornado mixer. At least $480K worth of tokens had been stolen at the time of the reports. While the initial attack was relatively small, the risk remained for other participants. On-chain researcher Chaofan Shou first noted the exploit, advising all users to withdraw permissions. Vestra DAO @Vestra_DAO is hacked just now and still ongoing. $480K loss already and more to come. Withdraw your stake and pull liquidity immediately. pic.twitter.com/0b9i1lhrEw — Chaofan Shou (@shoucccc) December 4, 2024 The exploit has affected the VSTR token staking contract, with the funds immediately liquidated and sent to the Tornado mixer. For VSTR, more than 65% of the tokens are locked for governance, with over 34B tokens. The affected smart contract holds the remaining 755M VSTR tokens, making up 1.51% of the total supply. Despite the attack against a relatively small token, the subsequent market crash erased even more value from the project. For now, Vestra DAO may have enough VSTR in its reserves to compensate users, while trying to repair its reputational damage. Exploiter waited for a month before exploiting a contract logic flaw The exploiter sold in a rush, paying 0.51 ETH to Beaverbuild for priority inclusion in a block. Vestra DAO’s locked staking contract was affected, directly sending out VSTR tokens. For hours, the exploiter sent out spam transactions for 520K or 500K VSTR to the contract, in the end, trading $480K in total. The attack exploited a logic flaw in the contract, which allowed the hacker to receive 20,000 VSTR after each transaction. On-chain analysis showed that the attacker first staked VSTR to the contract 30 days ago, lurking and studying the contract’s flaw. Then, the automated series of transactions started extracting VSTR with each iteration of staking and unstaking. The data checks on every deposit and withdrawal did not trigger any warnings, allowing the attacker to drain the contract over multiple deposit and withdrawal transactions. The contract checked the maturity only once, but the hacker had completed the requirement by staking 30 days ago. The result of the exploit was a haul of 125 ETH, which was mixed through Tornado Cash. The attacker spent $40K on Ethereum gas for the fastest possible swaps, briefly becoming the biggest gas user on the chain. Vestra DAO has not issued the specifics of the attack and claimed user funds remained unaffected. However, the contract was drained of its VSTR tokens, clearly taking value from the project. VSTR tokens hacked a month after trading launch Vestra DAO is a relatively new project, with VSTR tokens trading since November 6. The token is only available in a Uniswap V3 trading pair. The DAO ran its very first proposal on October 14, and it was tied to selling 1B tokens from the project’s treasury. The VSTR token still has only 1,643 holders, adding to the limited effect of the hack. The token immediately crashed after the attack, from $0.013 to $0.005. Later, VSTR inched up to $0.009 but remains extremely illiquid and volatile. In addition to the direct loss, VSTR also wiped out half its market capitalization. At this point, VSTR may be even riskier than early-stage meme tokens. The biggest risk is that VSTR tokens only have $1.9M in liquidity, which is not locked and can be further exploited via a rug pull. Vestra DAO (VSTR) still relies on a Uniswap V3 pair, while its liquidity is unlocked and at risk for a rug pull. | Source: DexScreener The other risk for the project is that its contracts invoke functions from external smart contracts, leading to a general warning on CoinGecko. Vestra DAO claimed it had blacklisted its staking contract, but it is unknown if similar vulnerabilities exist for other smart contracts. Even for audited projects, smart contracts may not always be entirely secure and may hold exploit possibilities. In the case of the VestraDAO, the early-stage project may recover and boost its reliability. Vestra DAO appealed to the Turkish crypto community, one of the most active groups of early adopters. The VSTR token even had a conversion price into Turkish lira .

In fact, one of my favorite ones had the whole company collapse around it in the build phase. I absolutely love what we’ve built with Superworld , for example, and what we’re about to release with Asvoria . Both of these require heavy machinery and rotation to come to life—and to be maintained. Enter Unyted and my newest spatial Web3 space, which allows me to deliver fluent, up-to-date presentations on what’s happening now while also providing an overview of my entire career. I built it mostly by myself, with some guidance and glitch-fixing help from the team—special thanks to Tijana, Saskia, and Florian. I can update it in minutes to include a new project, presentation, or missing link. It’s freeing and necessary. https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/unyted.mp4 Unyted is at the forefront of spatial computing, offering innovative solutions that empower users to create, own, and monetize immersive 3D virtual environments.

X is great for connecting with people, but for an artist, a lot is still missing from the full experience. Let’s see if we can bring these two innovations together in a sensible way. Watch the Tijana introduction to Unyted as well as my keynote held some time ago regarding web3, metaverse and creativity. Delivering the Metaverse They’re just starting out, and sure, sure there are a few glitches, but I’ve already given a couple of presentations that feel like a real departure from the world of Zoom. Nothing is ever perfect and getting going and constantly working on it is what keeps the thing alive. It’s a step closer to delivering something of real value in the metaverse. People showed up to my first keynote in the space done together, they asked questions and then some were left to wonder around the space to explore it on their own. Promises kept. Those matter, after the last run. I’ve been friends with Florian Krueger since the early blockchain days in London back in 2018, and we’ve collaborated on several projects. He remains one of my favorite people in the crypto space—always looking out for his people and tirelessly fighting for the ethical side of it. I was happy to hear he was starting a new venture and that I could also be a part of. If you prefer the (virtual) city life?

Exciting developments from Sol Strategies! We’ve signed a Letter of Intent to acquire additional Solana validators, a strategic step in expanding our presence in the $SOL ecosystem. Read more: https://t.co/Qyp1xOf3gN #Solana #Crypto #HODL #Validator — Sol Strategies (CSE: HODL | OTC: CYFRF) (@solstrategies_) December 4, 2024 The acquisition, outlined in a recently released letter of intent , marks another step in the company’s efforts to grow its validator operations. The acquisition will increase Sol Strategies’ delegated SOL by 554,714 tokens, valued at CAD $174.7 million. The company projects that this move will generate an annual net income of CAD $2.6 million. Transaction Details: Building Validator Strength The transaction includes several components designed to strengthen Sol Strategies’ operations. Upon closing, the company will pay USD $750,000 in cash or its equivalent in SOL or USDC, depending on its discretion. The vendor will also receive USD $750,000 in common shares, valued based on the stock’s closing price on the date of the definitive agreement. In addition, up to USD $5 million in common shares will be issued over the next three years, contingent on the achievement of specific performance targets. The acquisition will bring the total amount of SOL delegated to Sol Strategies’ validators to 1,493,378 SOL, valued at CAD $470.4 million. This represents a substantial boost from its current delegation and is expected to allow the company to earn higher validation commissions. The deal’s completion is subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval from the Canadian Securities Exchange and other necessary consents. Notably, Sol Strategies confirmed that no finder’s fees are associated with this transaction. Sol Strategies: From 174th to 83rd with $203M Validator Acquisition This latest acquisition follows a series of strategic moves by Sol Strategies to solidify its position in the Solana ecosystem. Just weeks prior, on November 14, the company acquired four validators from Cogent Crypto , adding 699,012 SOL (valued at USD $203.7 million) to its portfolio. https://t.co/Uf9qMiLWhH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 14, 2024 The addition of Cogent’s validators, renowned for a 99% slot success rate and outperforming competitors like Jupiter’s 98%, has enhanced Sol Strategies’ operational capacity. As a result, the company rose from 174th to 83rd in Solana’s validator rankings , unlocking opportunities for increased validation commissions. Beyond the Solana network, Sol Strategies expanded its validator operations into other blockchain ecosystems, including SUI , MONAD, and ARCH. The combined delegations from these acquisitions are valued at CAD $181.4 million, further diversifying the company’s validator portfolio. Growing Influence Under New Leadership Since its validator business launch in June, Sol Strategies has generated 1,430 SOL in revenue (around $242,000) and reinvested the profits into acquiring additional SOL. The company recently rebranded from Cypherpunk Holdings, signaling its focus on blockchain opportunities, particularly in the Solana ecosystem , known for its low fees and fast transaction speeds. Under CEO Leah Wald, the company’s stock value has surged 420% over the past month, strengthening its position to compete with industry leaders like Galaxy and others.

Meanwhile, Pepe Coin’s bullish momentum persists despite a massive whale sell-off, achieving a 143% monthly surge and fueling projections of a potential 7x rally. Over in the presale market, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out with its unstoppable momentum, raising over $155 million, as it rallies toward its ambitious $600 million goal. Despite parting ways with German soccer giant Borussia Dortmund due to regulatory shifts in Germany, BlockDAG’s collaboration with Inter Milan remains strong, reinforcing its global vision. Dogecoin’s Innovations Spark New Investment Debates ""Should I invest in Dogecoin?"" is a question gaining traction as the meme-turned-crypto powerhouse continues to evolve beyond its humorous origins. Dogecoin’s integration into emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), highlights its potential to support seamless microtransactions with low fees and fast processing. Additionally, its growing role in decentralized networks offers innovative ways to reward participation and enhance connectivity. Despite its volatility, Dogecoin has empowered financial inclusion and reshaped cross-border remittance processes with its affordability and efficiency. As Dogecoin pushes technological boundaries and garners strategic collaborations, it’s becoming more than a meme—it’s a compelling consideration for those exploring the future of digital assets. Whales Cash Out, But Pepe Crypto Remains Bullish A Pepe coin crypto whale has made headlines after selling 356.2 billion tokens for $7.54 million, achieving an extraordinary 31x return on a $237,000 investment made in September 2023. Despite this massive selloff, PEPE continues to defy market logic, with a 13.56% weekly gain and a staggering 143% monthly surge. Analysts remain bullish, projecting a potential 7x rally as the token benefits from growing market interest. This event highlights the unpredictable yet thrilling nature of meme coins like Pepe coin, where sentiment and strategy can deliver massive rewards. Investors are now closely monitoring its next potential breakout. BlockDAG’s Presale Booms Past $155M Despite BVB Shift BlockDAG’s partnership with Borussia Dortmund has ended as Germany’s new MiCA regulations come into effect, but this is not a setback for the project. This emerging project’s partnership saw a highly successful run, but its end also marks the beginning of a new chapter. As one door closes, another one swings wide open—BlockDAG’s collaboration with Inter Milan continues to thrive, whereas it is also reportedly in talks for a new collaboration with another crypto giant. Beyond partnerships, the real story lies in BlockDAG’s unstoppable momentum. Its presale is on fire, having raised $155 million and sold over 16.8 billion coins, edging closer to the ambitious $600 million goal. Priced at just $0.0234 in batch 26, the presale has delivered early adopters a staggering 2,240% ROI since batch 1—proof that this is the best crypto to buy right now. Dogecoin’s IoT innovations are impressive, and Pepe’s massive gains are thrilling, but neither can match BlockDAG’s robust infrastructure and visionary roadmap. These tokens thrive on sentiment, but BlockDAG thrives on utility, making it a long-term powerhouse. As the crypto presale continues to surge and the ecosystem expands, BlockDAG is attracting global attention from both developers and traders. With new partnerships on the way and demand skyrocketing, BlockDAG is leaving competitors in the dust. The vision here is bigger than short-term gains; it’s about building a platform that redefines blockchain utility. As BlockDAG marches toward its $600 million goal, it’s not just riding the bull market—it’s leading it. In Summary For all those wondering ‘Should I invest in Dogecoin?’, the meme coin’s recent advancements in IoT and decentralized networks mark a significant step in DOGE’s evolution, offering a real-world utility that extends beyond its meme origins. PEPE also defies expectations with its continued bullish momentum, even after a whale sell-off, reflecting the unpredictable yet exciting nature of meme coins. But BlockDAG emerges as a standout, combining innovation with utility. Its $155 million presale, 2,240% ROI for early adopters, and the ambitious $600 million goal exemplify its unmatched growth potential. Strengthened by its ongoing Inter Milan partnership, BlockDAG proves that vision, adaptability, and utility are key to thriving in this competitive market.

Polygon just transferred 8.68 million POL tokens to FalconX, sparking rumors of strategic partnerships, while Binance (BNB) continues its reign as the backbone of one of the largest crypto ecosystems. Meanwhile, a fresh face, Qubetics ($TICS), is turning heads with its innovative wallet technology and presale success. Already raising $4.3 million and selling 266 million tokens, Qubetics is aiming for a 900% ROI post-launch. Unlike the established players, Qubetics is solving problems most cryptos haven’t even attempted. Its No KYC, Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet is designed to make crypto as simple as everyday payment methods like Apple Pay. Plus, it automatically converts digital assets into fiat during transactions, removing the hassle of crypto’s notorious volatility. With its presale tokens priced at just $0.0282, the question isn’t “if” but “when” Qubetics will join the ranks of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Let’s break it all down. Qubetics ($TICS): The New Challenger With Real-World Utility Qubetics isn’t just another presale hype train. It’s a full-blown ecosystem designed to make crypto accessible for everyone. Currently in Presale Phase 11, $TICS is priced at $0.0282, but this won’t last long. With a 10% price hike every week and a post-presale target of $0.25, early investors could see gains up to 900%. That’s not just FOMO—that’s facts. The real magic of Qubetics lies in its No KYC, Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet. Imagine being a freelance graphic designer. You’ve got clients across the globe paying in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even lesser-known altcoins. Normally, you’d spend hours converting, managing, and dealing with volatility. But with Qubetics, payments are automatically converted to fiat at the point of sale . No stress, no surprises—just seamless transactions. And it doesn’t stop there. The wallet’s integration with Apple Pay and Google Pay means you can use your crypto like cash. Whether you’re on iOS, Android, or desktop, the experience is frictionless. Businesses love it, too. A boutique coffee shop can accept crypto without worrying about fluctuating prices or complex setups. It’s this blend of innovation and simplicity that makes Qubetics one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Binance (BNB): The Ecosystem Powerhouse Binance’s influence in the crypto world is undeniable. As the native token of the world’s largest crypto exchange, BNB does it all—from reducing trading fees to powering DeFi platforms and NFT marketplaces. And despite the occasional regulatory hiccup, Binance continues to innovate, recently launching a new liquidity mining program that’s drawn in institutional investors. BNB’s versatility is what keeps it in the conversation for the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Let’s say you’re a retail trader dabbling in altcoins. Holding BNB slashes your trading fees, saving you money with every transaction. On the DeFi side, platforms built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) offer some of the highest yields in the market, attracting both seasoned investors and newbies alike. Price-wise, BNB has been holding strong, trading near $250 with analysts projecting a rally to $300 as adoption grows. It’s not just a coin; it’s the backbone of an ecosystem that supports millions of users daily. If you’re into utility-focused projects with a proven track record, BNB is a must-have. Polygon (POL): The Layer 2 Trailblazer Polygon’s been on fire this year, and its latest move—a transfer of 8.68 million POL tokens to FalconX—has sparked speculation about upcoming partnerships. As a Layer 2 solution for Ethereum, Polygon is all about scalability. It’s like adding a turbocharger to your car—it makes Ethereum faster, cheaper, and more efficient. But why is Polygon one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024? Simple. It’s already integrated into some of the biggest Web3 applications out there, from DeFi platforms to NFT marketplaces. If you’re a gamer buying in-game assets or an artist selling NFTs, chances are you’ve interacted with Polygon without even knowing it. Polygon’s price action has been equally impressive. With POL tokens trading around $1.12, analysts are eyeing a push toward $1.50 by year’s end, especially if those FalconX rumors materialize. Combine that with its eco-friendly tech and strong developer community, and you’ve got a project that’s as future-proof as they come. Conclusion: The December Playbook Each of these projects brings something unique to the table. Qubetics is redefining usability with its No KYC, user-friendly wallet, Binance is dominating with its all-encompassing ecosystem, and Polygon is pushing the limits of scalability in Web3. Whether you’re a first-time investor or a seasoned trader, these three cryptos offer a mix of innovation, utility, and ROI potential. December’s crypto market is shaping up to be a battlefield, but with Qubetics, Binance, and Polygon in your corner, you’re set for some serious gains. Diversify your portfolio, stay informed, and get ready to ride the wave. Here’s the deal: crypto isn’t just about hype—it’s about finding projects with real-world impact and staying ahead of the curve. Qubetics ($TICS) is revolutionizing crypto payments, Binance (BNB) continues to anchor a massive ecosystem, and Polygon (POL) is scaling Web3 like a champ. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics, Binance, and Polygon as the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 . Don’t wait—opportunities like this don’t knock twice!

The Fireblocks team shared the new development on Dec. 4, noting that the DeFi expansion comes amid a significant spike in activity on its platform over the past year. Fireblocks chief product officer Idan Ofrat unveiled the two DeFi capabilities during SPARK, the company’s annual user conference. Token swaps and the allowance manager bring key safeguards for projects looking to enhance customer security as they interact with top DeFi applications, including Aave ( AAVE ) and Uniswap ( UNI ).

Fireblocks has also integrated with multiple crypto and mainstream providers.

37220619,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=25861,1733339626,"Doge Christmas (DOGECHRIS) Will Explode Over 15,000% Before Exchange Listings, While Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Lag","Doge Christmas could turn early investors into multi-millionaires, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did. Doge Christmas (DOGECHRIS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGECHRIS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge Christmas can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge Christmas could become the next viral memecoin. Doge Christmas launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge Christmas on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge Christmas by entering its contract address – FJFMw9SQSGJV5jgjaJVFjwUczRmqrprP5UcwvntZ7JMx – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

37220523,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=311607,1733339431,Binance Inflows for 2024 Are Almost 40% Higher Than the Next 10 Exchanges Combined,"The world’s biggest crypto exchange accounts for $21.6 billion in user fund deposits. So far this year, users’ funds inflows to Binance – the world’s largest digital asset exchange by registered users and trading volume – are almost 40% higher than the total of the next 10 crypto exchanges combined, as ranked by DefiLlama . According to the data platform, Binance accounts for $21.6 billion in inflows in 2024 to date, while the next 10 exchanges sum $15.9 billion (36% more). This year, Binance inflows have been supported by heightened global optimism over digital assets, fueled by major regulatory wins, growing adoption and historical price milestones. Binance’s global user base grew to 244 million people as more and more users have moved funds onto the exchange to participate in what may be the start of the golden age of crypto. Another strong driver of inflows could be the success of the Binance Launchpool program this year, reflecting the growing user interest in new tokens. Binance has observed that these funds tend to stay on the platform. The crypto industry has reached historic milestones in 2024. Bitcoin ETFs have gained approval in major markets such as the United States, Brazil, Hong Kong and Australia, signaling broader acceptance of digital assets. Within just one year, net inflows into BTC ETFs surpassed those of gold ETFs, a testament to the growing role of crypto in finance and its deeper integration with more traditional institutions and systems. The introduction of Bitcoin ETF options has made it easier for institutional investors to gain exposure and hedge risks, contributing significantly to the recent rally. With substantial inflows into these ETFs, Bitcoin is poised for further integration into mainstream financial markets. Richard Teng, CEO of Binance, said, “2024 has been a landmark year for the crypto industry, and we are incredibly grateful to our 244 million users and counting, who continued to trust Binance as their chosen platform for trading. “Their unwavering support and confidence drives us to innovate and provide the best possible experience in the world of digital assets.” Binance’s leadership in the crypto market is further underscored by another milestone recorded recently – being the first crypto centralized exchange to surpass $100 trillion in lifetime volumes, according to the digital asset data provider CCData. CryptoQuant, an on-chain and market data analytics provider, highlighted the following in their report . “[This year] has marked a significant shift in the cryptocurrency industry, with exchanges reporting sharp increases in average Bitcoin and USDT deposits, signaling heightened institutional participation. “Average Bitcoin deposits across all exchanges have risen from 0.36 BTC in 2023 to 1.65 BTC, while USDT deposits surged from $19,600 to $230,000. “These larger deposits reflect growing interest from professional and corporate investors, distinguishing institutional activity from retail trading. “Binance has led the industry in this institutional growth, posting the largest increase in average Bitcoin deposits among major exchanges.” This content is sponsored and should be regarded as promotional material.

37220514,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/crypto-prices-rise-again-and-experts-watch-catslap-cat-and-popcat,1733339345,"Crypto Prices Rise Again And Experts Watch Catslap, CAT and Popcat","While the Bitcoin price remains range-bound, cat meme coins are dominating the headlines with explosive returns. Popcat, Simon’s Cat and a new meme coin, Catslap (SLAP) , are among the top crypto gainers on Wednesday behind heavy whale bidding. In particular, the spotlight is on SLAP, owing to the rumours of upcoming Tier-1 CEX listings, burn events and its 8,400% explosive rally post-launch. Is It Time To Go All In On Cat Meme Coins? Cat-themed tokens appear poised to dominate the next meme coin rally and could be the best cryptos to buy for sidelined investors. For instance, prominent experts believe that Popcat is heavily undervalued as compared to other large-caps in the sector. The POPCAT price is up by a meagre 13% in the past 30 days, while Dogecoin, Pepe and Brett have surged by more than 150% in the same period. However, analysts believe that the local bottom is in for Popcat, which offers an excellent entry point for sidelined investors. Indeed, the Popcat price has successfully retested its macro trendline and has bounced back up by 8% today, prominent crypto trader Muro reveals. RookieXBT, a prominent social media influencer with nearly 500k X followers, projects that the largest cat-themed meme coin will hit $5 by the end of the year. https://x.com/RookieXBT/status/1863929767151456395 Similarly, smart money investors are scaling into long positions on Simon’s Cat (CAT). Legendary Bybit trader Bluntz signals that CAT is breaking out from a falling wedge that it had created over the past 3 weeks. Trader Wojak concurs with his assessment and projects that Simon’s Cat could nearly double before the end of the year. Simon’s Cat remains an attractive long-term investment in the meme coin sector. Being a multi-chain meme coin that is now live on both BNB Smart Chain and Solana, it has created significant brand awareness among potential investors. Moreover, the meme coin is live on Binance Futures, with strong speculation that a spot listing on Binance or Coinbase could be next. However, Popcat and CAT can only offer limited returns owing to their higher valuations. However, investors are eyeing up to 100x returns from microcaps like Catslap. Is Catslap The Next 100x Meme Coin? Whether it is Dogecoin, Pepe or recent phenomena like CHILLGUY, viral internet memes tend to give birth to the best meme coins. Catslap is no different, inspired by the popular “slapping cat” meme. Launching at an initial price of just $0.0001179, the SLAP price reached an all-time high of $0.01 on Tuesday, a staggering 8,400% growth. And yet, its peak undiluted market capitalization was $45 million. Catslap is currently trading at $0.0078, with a $35 million valuation and $6.8 million liquidity. Unsurprisingly, experts believe there is plenty of room for more explosive returns. As such, the project is seeing strong community support, which is rare for most new Ethereum meme coins. For instance, the token already has over 12k holders, nearly 11k X followers and over 3k Telegram subscribers, all within two weeks of its launch. Moreover, over 368 million $SLAP coins have already been staked in its reward pool and are earning 40% APY. Furthermore, its deflationary tokenomics have made it an attractive investment for smart money investors. Nearly $200k worth of SLAP coins have been removed from the market through the buy-back program while over $1.16 million worth of tokens have been burnt , both providing a major bullish boost to the token. The developer team has also launched a Slap-To-Earn game. Players with the most slaps become eligible for the upcoming airdrop. Moreover, once the “slapometer” hits certain milestones, a portion of the SLAP token supply is burned. An ongoing countdown on the Catslap website promising a “major announcement” is also adding to the hype. The Telegram community is speculating that a major CEX listing could be revealed tomorrow on Thursday. Whales are extremely bullish on the new meme coin and are buying on every dip. Even wallets connected to the Chicago-based proprietary trading house Jump Trading are buying SLAP. According to the latest reports, they have purchased over $470k worth of the token, which is now sitting at over $660k. Unsurprisingly, prominent crypto investors are bullish on Catslap, with some even calling it the next 100x meme coin. Being a small-cap meme coin, inspired by a viral meme and with strong fundamentals, SLAP is also drawing Binance and Coinbase rumours.

37220364,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=311605,1733339115,Solana Memecoin GIGA Rips 51% After Coinbase Adds Altcoin to Listing Roadmap,"A Solana ( SOL )-based memecoin is surging by double digits after Coinbase added the crypto asset to its listing roadmap. Gigachad ( GIGA ), a crypto asset inspired by the photo shoot of Russian bodybuilder Ernest Khalimov, soared 51% as the top US crypto exchange made the announcement . GIGA was trading for $0.0414 Wednesday morning and shot up to a high of $0.0627. GIGA has since retraced and is trading for $0.04856 at time of writing. With a market cap of $467.5 million, GIGA is the 237th largest crypto project. Coinbase uses the listing roadmap for transparency and to prevent insider trading on coins prior to them being listed. Being placed on the listing roadmap means the firm has determined the asset will likely be available for trading in the future. The exchange also announced the roadmap listing of Ethereum ( ETH )-based Turbo ( TURBO ), a GPT-4 inspired memecoin. After the announcement, TURBO shot up from $0.007723 to $0.009075, a more than 17% jump. TURBO has since retraced and is trading for $0.008165 at time of writing. With a market cap of $563.1 million, TURBO is the 202nd largest crypto project. The two memecoins are among several others that Coinbase has recently indicated it will soon support. The exchange announced this week it was adding to its roadmap MOG Coin ( MOG ), a memecoin available on both the Ethereum and Base blockchains, as well as the new Solana-based memecoin Moo Deng ( MOODENG ). MOG is trading for $0.000002317 at time of writing, down 4.6% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, MOODENG is trading for $0.0001323, up 12.7% in the last 24 hours.

37220350,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=106826,1733339044,U.S. Government Transfers $33.6M in Seized Crypto to Anonymous Addresses,"U.S. Government Transfers $33.6M in Seized Crypto to Anonymous Addresses On December 3, 2024, the U.S. government executed a significant transfer of $33.6 million in seized cryptocurrency assets to two anonymous blockchain addresses. The transfer included 5,024 ETH (valued at $18 million), $13 million in Binance USD (BUSD), $1.5 million in Shiba Inu (SHIB), and smaller amounts of other tokens. The anonymous wallet addresses involved begin with 0x9cd and 0x9ac , as per reports by The Block . This move comes amidst growing scrutiny over the handling of confiscated digital assets, particularly those linked to major collapses such as FTX/Alameda Research , from which these funds were reportedly seized. Breaking Down the $33.6 Million Transfer ETH Dominates the Seized Funds The largest portion of the transfer involved Ethereum (ETH) , accounting for over 50% of the total value at $18 million. Ethereum’s prominence in such transactions underscores its widespread adoption and liquidity in the cryptocurrency market. Stablecoins and Altcoins Also in Play The second-largest chunk comprised $13 million in BUSD , a popular stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, offering minimal volatility. Additionally, $1.5 million in Shiba Inu (SHIB) , the meme-inspired cryptocurrency, and various other altcoins were included in the transfer. Data Insights from Arkham Intelligence Blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence confirmed that these assets were seized from FTX/Alameda Research , the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange and its associated trading firm. These organizations faced allegations of mismanagement and fraudulent activities, leading to their collapse in late 2022. The government’s handling of seized crypto assets has historically involved liquidation or storage in secure wallets. This unusual transfer to anonymous addresses raises questions about the purpose and potential implications. Why Were the Funds Transferred? Potential Scenarios for the Transfer Auction Preparations: Governments often auction off seized assets to recover value. The movement of funds could signal upcoming liquidation efforts. Interagency Transfers: Funds might have been moved between government-controlled wallets for compliance or accounting purposes. Partnerships or Payments: Rarely, such transfers are linked to partnerships or settlements with external parties. Anonymous Addresses: A Cause for Concern? The use of anonymous wallets, despite the transparency of blockchain transactions, has sparked debates. Critics argue it creates opacity, countering the principles of accountability associated with digital assets. FTX/Alameda Fallout and Asset Recovery The fallout from FTX/Alameda has had profound implications for the crypto industry. Billions in customer funds went missing during the scandal, prompting investigations worldwide. The recovery of assets like these seized cryptocurrencies represents efforts to recoup losses and distribute funds back to affected creditors and investors. The U.S. government has actively pursued legal and financial actions, recovering millions in crypto over the past year. However, the disposition of these assets often faces logistical, legal, and ethical challenges. Crypto Seizures and Their Broader Implications Growing Trends in Crypto Seizures As cryptocurrency adoption grows, so do the cases of misuse and subsequent seizures by authorities. From ransomware operators to fraudulent exchanges, governments are finding new ways to track and reclaim digital assets. Legal Complexities The decentralized nature of crypto complicates asset recovery. Seized funds are often tangled in multi-jurisdictional legal battles, making the resolution process lengthy and uncertain. Impact on Market Dynamics Transfers of large crypto holdings can influence market prices, especially for volatile tokens like SHIB. Traders often monitor government wallets for signs of impending sales or movements, adjusting their strategies accordingly. Community Reactions and Concerns The crypto community has expressed mixed reactions to the $33.6 million transfer. Some see it as a standard operational move, while others worry about the implications of using anonymous wallets. Transparency advocates have called for clearer reporting on such transactions to ensure public trust. Conclusion: A Case Study in Seized Crypto Management The U.S. government’s $33.6 million crypto transfer sheds light on the ongoing complexities of managing seized digital assets. As blockchain continues to revolutionize financial systems, governments must adapt to its unique challenges and opportunities. Whether for liquidation, compliance, or other purposes, the transfer highlights the importance of transparency in such high-stakes transactions.

The surge has led to higher staking rewards and more ether (ETH) being burned via transaction fees, the report said. ""This combination strengthens Ethereum's tokenomics,"" Steno said, making ether a more appealing asset. Steno noted that the amount of USDT on the Ethereum network surpassed supply on the Tron blockchain for the first time in more than two years.

BITCOIN GETS A DEX: Osmosis, a decentralized exchange (DEX) built for the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem, has opened a bridge to the Bitcoin network, as part of a pivot toward the world's largest cryptocurrency. The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that governs Osmosis voted in favor of adopting Bitcoin bridge Nomic in June. The integration went live on Tuesday. Nomic's bridge now enables users to deposit their BTC on the Bitcoin network in return for a token called alloyed BTC (allBTC) on Osmosis. “The novel thing with Nomic is that it’s all decentralized,"" said Matt Bell, CEO of Turbofish, the team of developers behind Nomic. ""The whole flow for users, from having Bitcoin in their wallet to the Bitcoin being on Osmosis, remains decentralized with Nomic. There’s no Bitgo or Coinbase in the middle.” In the big picture, Osmosis is one of several projects attempting to leverage the value tied up in BTC, by far the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, to bring liquidity to the broader crypto world.

The fundraising comes after Union raised $4 million in seed financing last year. Borderless Capital participated in the new round, along with angels from the Polygon, Celestia, Movement, and Berachain communities, Union Labs said Tuesday. Union’s core product is a modular, zero-knowledge (ZK) interoperability layer, designed to ease movement of assets between the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems. Its mainnet is supposed to go live in early 2025. Union is also interested in building in the Bitcoin ecosystem, “addressing the chain’s scripting limitations to enable secure asset transfers across Bitcoin L2s and the multichain ecosystem, enhancing DeFi on Bitcoin,” the team said.

Read more  ETHEREUM'S JUSTIN DRAKE SEES NO THREAT IN SOLANA  Ethereum developer Justin Drake said his comprehensive proposal to overhaul the second-largest blockchain's consensus layer isn't about catching up with a rival, it's about sticking around for the long haul.  Drake unveiled the proposal, known as the Beam Chain, at Ethereum's biennial Devcon gathering in Bangkok last month, at a tim when the network's native token ETH is lagging behind its counterparts at other major layer-1 blockchains.  The Ethereum network enjoyed wide adoption over the last few years, making it more expensive and slower to use. In response, a cohort of layer-1s, known as “Ethereum killers,” emerged in 2020 to compete with Ethereum on transaction speeds, and Solana has been seen as the leader of the back.  Recently, activity on Solana has exploded, mainly thanks to the surge of memecoins on the blockchain, with users wondering whether it will overtake Ethereum as the “hot” chain.  But Drake said he doesn’t see Solana as a threat to Ethereum, and neither does he see the Beam Chain as a way to restore Ethereum’s edge in the short term.  The Beam Chain “is all about improving the long-term health and security of the consensus layer, it has nothing to do with performance,” Drake said in an interview with CoinDesk.  “Solana has no consideration for health. The only thing they care about is performance. They care about reducing latency and increasing throughput,” Drake added.

He faced public skepticism, with many questioning the viability of the decision during a volatile market period. Addressing his critics, he remarked, “You all mock me… Now you wish you would have done it.” Per the event, Adams sees cryptocurrencies as tools for innovation and economic empowerment, particularly in underserved communities.

37220250,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656715,1733338849,Dogecoin Is ‘Ready To Run Again’ – Analyst Expects 60% Rally,"Dogecoin has entered a consolidation phase, holding below its recent local high of $0.48. Despite showing signs of bullish momentum, the price has struggled to break above key resistance levels, leaving traders and investors anticipating its next move. Market sentiment remains optimistic as Dogecoin continues to attract attention from retail and institutional players. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Keep Buying – DOGE Metrics Reveal Demand Remains Strong Top analyst Altstreet Bets recently shared a detailed technical analysis, suggesting that Dogecoin is poised for another rally. According to his analysis, DOGE is forming a strong base, indicating that a breakout could be imminent. Altstreet Bets has set an ambitious target of $0.65, predicting that the meme coin leader could reach this level in the coming weeks if current support holds and demand increases. Dogecoin’s consolidation phase is not unusual following a significant rally, as the market often takes time to stabilize before continuing its upward trajectory. For DOGE, breaking above $0.48 will signal that it is ready to resume its rally. As market participants closely watch for signs of a breakout, Dogecoin’s ability to hold current support levels will determine whether it can live up to its bullish expectations and reach new highs shortly. Can Dogecoin Rally Continue? Dogecoin has captivated the market with impressive gains of approximately 220% since November 5, fueling optimism among investors who believe the meme coin has more upside potential this cycle. However, the price is currently stuck below its $0.48 local high, set on November 23, raising concerns about whether it can sustain its momentum. DOGE must break decisively above this critical resistance level to reclaim its bullish trend. Altstreet Bets offered a compelling analysis on X, suggesting that Dogecoin is primed for another run. According to his insights, a breakout above the $0.45-$0.48 range would confirm renewed momentum, potentially driving the price to $0.67. Such a move would represent a 60% continuation of its ongoing trend and solidify Dogecoin’s leadership in the meme coin market. Despite the optimism, risks remain. Dogecoin could face further consolidation or a correction as the broader market waits for the next catalyst. The price action around the $0.45-$0.48 level will be critical in determining the coin’s trajectory. If DOGE fails to break higher, it may continue its sideways movement or retrace, testing lower support levels as investors reassess their strategies. Related Reading: XRP Reaches 6-Year High – Whales And STH Accumulate Together For now, the market’s attention remains fixed on Dogecoin, with its ability to hold current levels and overcome resistance being pivotal in maintaining its upward momentum. DOGE Approaches Pivotal Resistance Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.42, experiencing days of sideways price action and repeated failed attempts to break above the $0.44 resistance level. This critical level has proven to be a tough barrier, holding back DOGE’s bullish momentum. However, analysts agree that once Dogecoin breaks above $0.44, a strong bullish breakout could propel the meme coin toward new all-time highs. Despite the optimism, the current lack of a decisive move raises concerns. If Dogecoin fails to break out in the coming days, it risks prolonged consolidation or a potential correction. This scenario could dampen market enthusiasm and lead to a test of lower support levels, further stalling DOGE’s upward trajectory.

Such a move would confirm bullish sentiment and pave the way for massive gains in the weeks ahead.

The coming days will be crucial in determining whether Dogecoin can maintain its status as the leader of the meme coin market or face a setback.

Here is everything Powell said about the US economy: Independence allows the Fed to make decisions for all Americans rather than for any political party. I think the same institutional relationship between the Fed and the Treasury Department will continue under the new administration. There is broad bipartisan support for the Fed's independence; there is no risk of losing that independence. The US economy is in very good shape. I feel comfortable with current monetary policy. Related News: Will Bitcoin Break the Critical $100,000 Threshold? Analysts Share the Most Important Challenge and Solution I am confident that I will have the same relationship with Treasury Secretary Benson in the next administration that I have with other finance ministers. What Trump said privately and what he said publicly during his first term were the same. When asked about the impact of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Fed Chairman Powell said that the Fed's independence comes in part from being self-funded. The trend towards central bank transparency is highly constructive for policy making. I don't think the idea of having a “shadow chair” of the Fed is possible at all. We made very, very rapid adjustments to interest rates. The economy is in good shape and there is no reason to think it can't continue. Unemployment remains low and progress is being made on inflation. Over time, the Fed will move toward a more neutral interest rate. Even though downside risks are lower than expected, the Fed may move cautiously toward a neutral interest rate. The Fed is trying to find a middle ground with a less restrictive policy so that inflation can fall without hurting the labor market. Low survey response levels can increase the volatility of labor market data estimates. There is too much uncertainty about future tariff policies, and the Fed cannot begin to formulate policies to respond to it at this time. The Fed does not have an institutional view on appropriate tariff levels or immigration. Increased immigration is partly responsible for strong economic growth in 2023. We model, review and evaluate customs tariff proposals. The Fed does not comment on dollar policy; that is the responsibility of the Treasury Department. *This is not investment advice.

This development signals the growing adoption and heightened interest in XRP from individual users and institutional investors. The congestion highlights a notable milestone for the XRPL ecosystem, reflecting its escalating prominence in the broader cryptocurrency market.

This price surge, which saw XRP reach a peak of $2.86—the highest since 2018—shows renewed confidence in the asset and its ecosystem. The current trading volume of XRP stands at a staggering $47.1 billion over the last 24 hours, ranking it third in global market activity by trading volume. Farina emphasized the significance of this development by pointing out the growing ecosystem activity. He described the network congestion as “a clear signal that the ecosystem is absolutely exploding.” Farina’s statement aligns with the overall sentiment that XRP’s recent milestones highlight its increasing utility and relevance in the market. This renewed momentum is largely fueled by the return of institutional investors , who are actively engaging with XRP after a prolonged period of market uncertainty. Analysts attribute this resurgence to several key factors, including the asset’s unique utility for cross-border payments, favorable regulatory developments, and the increasing adoption of blockchain technology in traditional finance sectors. However, Chief of these is the resignation of current SEC Chai Gary Gensler .

SHIB was last trading around $0.00002959 but continues to power higher into the end of 2025 as meme season continues to heat up. The latest Shibarium upgrade, called the Heimdall & Bor hard forks, brings better compatibility with Ethereum in wake of its Dencun upgrade earlier in the year, and features a new upgradeable burn contract. #Shibarium Mainnet Upgraded! Heimdall & Bor hardforks are LIVE, bringing @Ethereum ’s Dencun compatibility, better stability, optimized performance, and new UPGRADABLE BURN CONTRACT! Find More https://t.co/MSw3ntCaeN pic.twitter.com/VKFZhtOyCe — Shibarium Network (@ShibariumNet) December 3, 2024 As meme season accelerates, SHIB could soon see a fresh acceleration to the upside and challenge its 2024 highs in the $0.000045 area, price predictions suggest. A retest of record highs above $0.000080 for the SHIB price are also a possibility in this bull market. That would mark around 2.5x gains from current levels, making SHIB a strong candidate for best meme coin to buy now in wake of the Shibarium upgrade. But could SHIB ever reach $1? Shibarium Upgrade – Can It Send SHIB to $1? SHIB currently has a circulating supply of around 584 trillion. A price of $1 would require SHIB to reach a market cap higher than the combined value of all financial assets in the world right now. That’s an unrealistic expectation, to say the least. But if that supply was to be drastically reduced, then perhaps $1 could be possible. Indeed, the latest Shibarium upgrade does feature an upgradeable burn contract. It remains unclear how far and fast the new upgrade, deployed at address 0x541 on block 8200512 , will reduce supply. But the Shibarium website says this upgradeable burn contract will “support exciting future updates and enhancements” and “adds a significant feature that will help reduce the total token supply, providing additional value for holders”. According to SHIBBurn.com , over 410 trillion SHIB tokens have been burnt so far, amounting to over 40% of the initial supply. Perhaps, in time, the supply can be reduced from the hundreds of trillions to the billions following this Shibarium upgrade, and then SHIB would be in with a shot of hitting $1. Alternative Meme Coin to Consider SHIB has big upside potential in the months ahead, with meme season expected to extend into early 2025. However, its already bloated market cap – last around $18 billion according to CoinMarketCap.com – suggests the room for further exponential gains is limited. Crypto traders looking for the next 100x coin might want to look at smaller, newer coins that are showing good early momentum. One coin that has caught the attention of the team at cryptonews.com is a new cat-themed Ethereum meme coin called Catslap (SLAP). SLAP’s market cap was around $66 million, according to DEXTools.

37220509,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622686,1733338490,2 IcomTech Ponzi scheme promoters sentenced to 10 years in prison,"Despite the existence of a government that is pro-crypto, the United States authorities are not being lenient toward fraudsters. David Brend, who was convicted of conspiracy to commit wire fraud for promoting crypto mining and trading firm IcomTech, has been sentenced to 10 years in prison. In a hearing held on December 2 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Judge Jennifer Rochon sentenced Brend to 10 years imprisonment at the Federal Prison Camp in Pensacola, Florida. It is anticipated that he will surrender to prison authorities on December 16 and pay the forfeiture amount of $40,000. Brend’s sentencing occurred approximately one month after Judge Rochon sentenced his colleague IcomTech promoter, Gustavo Rodriguez, to eight years in prison. The judge indicated that the severe sentence was intended to discourage “crypto frauds.” IcomTech ponzi scheme case Following a two-week trial in March of this year, the Honorable Jennifer L. Rochon sentenced Brend and Rodriguez, who were both convicted of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced that David Brend was one of the perpetrators in the large-scale crypto Ponzi scheme known as IcomTech. In a Dec. 3 statement, Damian Williams stated, “David Brend and Gustavo Rodriguez were central to the IcomTech Ponzi scheme — Rodriguez as the chief architect of its sham website, Brend as a face-to-face salesman who peddled the bogus enterprise and its supposed lucrative returns for investors.” Brend, along with others, defrauded thousands of individuals out of millions of dollars. According to the US Attorney’s office , he was one of the IcomTech promoters who traveled across the country to encourage individuals to use the platform’s investment products for “financial freedom. ” The indictment contended that IcomTech operated as a crypto-based Ponzi scheme, swindling over $8 million from users between 2018 and 2019. Rodriguez, 48, of North Hollywood, California, was also sentenced to prison and ordered to pay forfeiture of $40,000, which represents his direct proceeds from the offense. Additionally, Judge Rochon ordered the 50-year-old Brend of Tampa, Florida, to pay forfeiture and restitution in amounts that will be determined at future hearings. How Brend and his accomplices were involved in the IcomTech Ponzi scheme In mid-2018, IcomTech was founded when co-defendant David Carmona contracted Rodriguez to develop a website for the scheme. IcomTech was a purported crypto mining and trading corporation that promised to generate profits for its victim investors in exchange for their acquisition of purported crypto-related investment products. Among other things, Carmona, Brend, and the other promoters of IcomTech made fraudulent promises to their respective Victims, including that profits from the companies’ crypto trading and mining would result in guaranteed daily returns on Victims’ investments. In reality, IcomTech did not engage in crypto trading or mining for its Investors. Brend and IcomTech’s other promoters used victim funds to pay other victims, further promote the schemes, and enrich themselves. As early as August 2018, victims who attempted to withdraw money from their online portal accounts encountered difficulties. When they complained to promoters, they were met with excuses, delays, and concealed fees if they were able to make any withdrawals at all. In an effort to infuse liquidity into IcomTech, as complaints escalated, IcomTech initiated the sale of proprietary crypto-tokens. Promoters of the schemes asserted that these tokens, which are referred to as “Icoms,” would ultimately be worth a substantial sum of money when companies accepted them as payment for products and services. In reality, “Icoms” were essentially meaningless and caused additional financial hardship for the victims. By or around the conclusion of 2019, IcomTech ceased to provide payments to victims, and the company ultimately collapsed. David Carmona, the founder of IcomTech and the alleged “mastermind” of the organization, was apprehended by authorities in 2022. In October, a judge sentenced him to ten years in prison. The company’s CEO, Marco Ochoa, was sentenced to five years in prison in January.

37220348,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98352,1733338490,Grayscale Tips Solana Adoption as SOL Outperforms Ether This Year,"Assets management firm Grayscale expects Solana’s (SOL) rise to continue as it outperforms major crypto assets. In a recent market report, the firm noted that Solana trumped Ethereum this year due to meme coin trading on the network. This extends SOL’s upward run over top assets from 2023 when institutions increased their appetite in the market. Last year, Solana was tagged as an institutional investor favorite after recording consecutive weekly inflows that boosted its total assets under management (AUM). Ethereum recorded a string of losses in the same time frame, with outflows mounting towards the end of the year. In the report, Grayscale analysts point to meme coins on Solana as a key bull driver in the ecosystem. Solana meme coins have attracted community participation as adoption flows to the ecosystem. In Q1 2024, inflows to Solana tokens sparked the meme coin frenzy as the market cap crossed $70 billion. Currently, Solana generates fees like Ethereum’s layer 1 with only a fraction of the market cap. With growing competition, if the network expands use cases to include decentralized physical infrastructure and stablecoins, the network will likely notch more inflows. SOL trades at $229, a 5% increase in the last 24 hours. Ethereum Still Ignites Bull Interests Although the altcoin leader has crawled compared to Bitcoin and Solana, the asset has had several high points. The approval of spot Ethereum ETF saw renewed institutional interest despite low price impacts. The staking feature, alongside its deep smart contract and decentralized finance (DeFi) volumes, attracts investors. “ Grayscale Research thinks that Ethereum is “playing the long game”: bootstrapping network effects by keeping fees low for Base and other Layer 2s. In a post-election regulatory environment, trends in institutional adoption of digital assets may help determine whether Ethereum’s scaling strategy will support its leading position among smart contract platforms over time.” Altcoins Posts Mixed Numbers Amid speculations of an imminent altcoin season , price fluctuations have led to assets hitting new highs while others struggle above waters. Ethereum trades at $3,688 with bulls looking towards $4K as the next target. Similarly, XRP soared to $2.60 flipping USDT to become the third largest crypto asset. Cardano (ADA) also crossed the $1 mark although recent numbers this week place the asset in the red zone.

Analysts Share the Most Important Challenge and Solution","Bitcoin’s path to the highly anticipated $100,000 milestone faces a critical hurdle: the ability of new buyers to absorb selling pressure from long-term holders (LTH). Analysts from Bitfinex and Copper.co have highlighted key market dynamics that could either support or hinder the largest cryptocurrency’s upward momentum. According to Bitfinex analysts, the supply from short holders (STH) is approaching its all-time high of 3.28 million Bitcoin, a level historically associated with the beginning of bull market peaks. While this signals growing retail interest, it also highlights a challenge: balancing incoming demand with for-profit sales of LTH. Analysts noted that the sustained sell-off from LTHs over the past two weeks, combined with limited spot demand, could trigger a pullback in Bitcoin price. Related News: Turkish Treasury and Finance Minister Speaks About Cryptocurrencies Amid concerns about selling pressure, some analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s outlook, citing the potential impact of ETFs. Fadi Aboualfa, Director of Research at Copper.co, pointed out that ETF inflows are a key demand driver that could counter profit-taking from long-term holders and push BTC toward the $100,000 target. “Every 10,000 BTC added by ETFs has historically increased the price of BTC by 2.2%,” Aboualfa said. He estimated that $1.9 billion inflows into ETFs could buy another 20,000 BTC, potentially pushing the price to $100,000 within weeks. *This is not investment advice.

Crypto All-Stars (STARS) has already raised over $8 million in its presale fundraising, signalling strong community support and high upside potential. With just 15 days left in the presale, the FOMO buys are ramping up and prominent investors aren’t waiting for its IEO to buy STARS. Many among them are eyeing up to 100x returns from the new meme coin. Why Is Crypto All-Stars In Such High Demand? Crypto All-Stars is quickly establishing itself as one of the hottest microcap meme coins on the market. Unlike most new tokens, STARS has taken strong steps to be much more than just another pump-and-dump scheme. Its key selling point is MemeVault, the first-ever multi-chain, multi-token staking platform. Meme coins today comprise a larger-than-ever portion of investors’ portfolios. For instance, Dogecoin and Pepe are currently seeing a strong influx of retail investors owing to their bullish price charts. However, DOGE, PEPE and many of the top meme tokens do not offer any passive income or additional utility. For instance, Pepe holders did not see any returns over the past week, considering the meme coin fell by nearly 1% in that period. With MemeVault’s unified staking model, meme coin investors can stake their coins and earn attractive passive income. The platform will accept 12 meme coins following its launch, including Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki (FLOKI), Based Brett (BRETT), Mog Coin (MOG), Milady Meme Coin (LADYS), Turbo (TURBO), Toshi (TOSHI), Coq Inu (COQ), Bonk (BONK) and STARS. STARS buyers will earn thrice the rewards of any other token. In fact, presale buyers can benefit from a secondary staking protocol even before MemeVault’s launch. The presale staking pool is currently offering a reward rate of over 260%. With such attractive monetary perks on offer, it is no surprise that experts are viewing Crypto All-Stars as one of the most bullish coins of 2024. STARS Price Prediction From Experts Crypto All-Stars has already impressed smart money investors and is receiving praise in heaps. For instance, YouTuber Austin Hilton with over 284k subscribers has called STARS its favourite presale meme coin of all time, citing its in-demand utilities like MemeVault. Meanwhile, ClayBro with over 130k YouTube subscribers is eyeing nearly 70x returns from the meme coin. After all, despite its stellar presale performance, STARS is a microcap token. Low-cap meme coins with much less to offer have already delivered over 1000x returns during this bull cycle. There is also strong speculation that Crypto All-Stars could be the next Binance listing. As such, the world’s leading crypto exchange has been listing low-cap meme coins with strong community support. STARS’ strong fundamentals, including community-centric tokenomics, successful security audits and robust social media following also help its cause. Unsurprisingly, a few prominent investors are even calling Crypto All-Stars the next 100x meme coin. However, with just 15 days left in its ICO, sidelined investors have a very short window to buy the meme coin at its discounted price. The project’s presale reward rate is also decreasing every day. Interested buyers can visit the project website, use the over-the-counter widget and buy STARS either with a bank card or by swapping crypto coins.

More here https://t.co/5pAH4lUQgB — BIT Mining Limited (@BITMining_BTCM) December 4, 2024 The company reported that as of November 27, 2024, it had mined 84,485.42 Litecoin (LTC) and 227,908,250.38 Dogecoin (DOGE) using its LD3 miners, which contribute 1.32% of the global hash rate for these networks. Three Times More Profitable Than Bitcoin Mining BIT Mining currently operates 5,552 active LD3 mining machines, which mine Litecoin, Dogecoin, and the newer BEL coin. Together, these machines deliver a combined hash rate of 18.94 TH/s, ranking BIT Mining among the largest contributors to Litecoin and Dogecoin networks. The LD3 miners, developed in-house, are celebrated for their cost-effectiveness and short payback period. BIT Mining credited the development of these miners to its 2021 acquisition of blockchain hardware design firm Bee Computing. BIT Mining CEO Xianfeng Yang emphasized the company’s adaptive strategy, stating: “At BIT Mining, we believe our cutting-edge technology and forward-thinking strategy uniquely position us to adapt to market shifts and seize new opportunities.” He added, “By combining innovation with agility, we are enhancing our competitive edge and creating value for our stakeholders.” The company emphasized that Litecoin and Dogecoin mining has proven more profitable than Bitcoin mining , with recent price rallies driving this surge. Favorable market conditions have made these altcoins attractive options for miners seeking to optimize returns. DOGE and LTC Mining Gains Momentum BIT Mining’s Chief Economist, Youwei Yang, expressed optimism about Litecoin and Dogecoin, citing advancements in blockchain technology and growing network interoperability. “The recent rally in Litecoin and Dogecoin, fueled in part by Elon Musk’s influence and regulatory shifts following the Trump administration’s return, has had a major impact on mining profitability,” Yang explained. He further elaborated on how these factors, combined with ongoing blockchain advancements, have fueled optimism across the crypto market.

This gain has gone some way to repairing the minor damage SOL has sustained in the past few days, with the coin now flat in the past week. It also remains up by 44% in the past month and by 280% in the past year, with these increases reflecting the medium- and long-term momentum it has generated in 2024. And with Grayscale’s application likely to be successful under the incoming Trump administration, Solana could have a massive 2025. Grayscale’s Spot Solana ETF Could Ignite SOL to $400 – Here’s Why Bulls Are Watching Grayscale filed its application with the SEC yesterday, with its filing declaring that the ETF would trade under the GSOL ticker, if accepted. SOL ripping on the news that Grayscale had filed for a Solana ETF pic.twitter.com/14MCapaNc8 — TylerD (@Tyler_Did_It) December 3, 2024 The market has accepted to this news bullishly, which is not surprising given that Grayscale’s Solana Trust is currently the biggest SOL investment fund in the world, worth around $134 million. By converting it into an ETF, Grayscale aim to ensure that the value of the fund more accurately tracks the underlying price of Solana. Given its existing size and Grayscale’s reputation, it would likely attract a significant number of institutional investors, in turn boosting SOL’s price. And it likely won’t be the only Solana ETF to emerge next year, with Bitwise, VanEck, 21Shares and Canary Capital also applying to launch their own funds in recent weeks. Cboe has filed 19b-4s w/ SEC for… Canary Solana ETF Bitwise Solana ETF VanEck Solana ETF 21Shares Core Solana ETF — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) November 21, 2024 Clearly, if these end up going live, SOL will rally accordingly. It was going to rally strongly anyway, given that Solana remains the third-biggest layer-one blockchain in terms of value locked in . But interest from institutions will boost it even further, with its chart today stuck in the middle between recovery and further dips. Source: TradingView Its RSI (purple) has dipped to 50 in the past hour, a sign that its overnight rally is now losing a little bit of steam. Yet its 30-period average (orange) has remained below the 200-period average (purple) for the best part of a week now, implying that the coin is due a rebound. This is likely to come in the next few days, with the coin’s trading volume at a healthy $10.4 billion today. The Solana price could therefore reach $250 in the next couple of weeks, before breaking its ATH of $263 by the end of the year. New Presale Tokens for Big Returns Solana looks like it will be one of the best-performing major alts next year, but it won’t be the only altcoin to perform strongly. We’re also likely to see strong showings from presale coins, with the biggest such coins often surging when they list for the first time, especially if they’ve had a successful sale.

37219596,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622644,1733337254,Putin says America is “eroding the foundation of its own economic dominance”,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused the United States of destroying its own economic power, claiming America is “eroding the foundation of its own economic dominance.” Speaking at a recent conference, his remarks targeted U.S. policies that, according to him, are not just shortsighted but actively weakening the dollar’s grip as the world’s reserve currency. The recent election of Donald Trump has added more heat to the already boiling tensions between Russia and the U.S. Trump has made it clear he won’t hesitate to impose 100% tariffs on BRICS nations if they even attempt to create a currency that could challenge the dollar. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also warned that such aggressive moves would only push these nations further away from the dollar and closer to adopting their own national currencies. Putin’s longstanding criticism of U.S. economic tactics Putin has accused America of acting like an empire, making the kind of mistakes that lead to its own decline. Over the years, his arguments have revolved around the idea that sanctions and economic policies meant to punish other countries are, in fact, backfiring on the U.S. economy. “The dollar is beginning to lose its appeal as a reserve currency for a number of countries,” he said, hammering home his belief that the U.S. is driving nations to seek alternatives. High inflation in Russia—currently at 9%—also came up during the discussion. Putin urged collaboration between the Russian government and its central bank to stabilize the economy. He assured listeners that it was a priority for him. A 100% tariff from America would effectively double the price of goods imported from countries like China and Brazil. American consumers would feel the hit immediately, with skyrocketing prices on everyday items like electronics and coffee. Economists are warning that this could push inflation even higher in the U.S., making it a lose-lose situation for everyone involved. Peskov said, “Aggressive U.S. tactics will push countries further away from the dollar.” The dollar’s waning influence For years, the dollar has been the undisputed king of global trade. But that reign is starting to look shaky. More countries are now questioning why they should depend on a currency controlled by a single nation, especially one that uses its financial system as a weapon. The idea of creating a SWIFT-like payment system for BRICS nations has been getting popular recently. Such a system would allow these countries to trade directly with each other using their own currencies, bypassing the dollar entirely. This isn’t even about economics, it’s about sovereignty. By reducing their reliance on the dollar, these nations are also reducing their vulnerability to U.S. sanctions and economic pressures. Meanwhile, Putin didn’t just talk about the dollar. He also weighed in on the growing role of digital currencies like Bitcoin. “Nobody can ban Bitcoin,” he said . The Russian president now believes crypto could play a key role in reducing transaction costs and improving the reliability of international trade.

Here’s What Analysts Say,"South Korea’s cryptocurrency markets remain volatile following recent political turmoil triggered by President Yoon Suk-yeol’s controversial declaration of martial law that was invalidated after just six hours. Lawmakers and citizens outraged by the move are now pushing for Yoon's removal, a development that analysts warn could increase market instability. On Tuesday night, Yoon declared martial law to stem growing criticism from his opposition party. The decision was met with a swift backlash, even from within Yoon's People Power Party. According to MBC News, a coalition of 191 lawmakers today launched impeachment proceedings, with a vote expected later this week. The political chaos had an immediate impact on South Korea’s crypto markets, with leading exchanges Upbit and Bithumb experiencing system outages due to traffic surges, while cryptocurrency prices saw a sharp drop. While prices have since recovered, analysts warn that further developments, including a possible impeachment, could continue the volatility. Related News: BREAKING : Coinbase Announces to List Two New Altcoins “New developments such as impeachment proceedings could cause volatility, but the impact is likely to be limited to the domestic market and short-lived,” said Min Jung, research analyst at Presto Research. However, others warn of broader implications. DeSpread Research President Seunghwa Lee noted that political instability in South Korea could spill over into global markets, especially for cryptocurrencies that are heavily traded by Korean investors. XRP, a favorite of South Korean traders, fell 15% more than average during the martial law declaration, according to CoinGecko data. “Given the significant influence of South Korean investors, political events that dampen investor sentiment could have sufficient impact on global markets,” Lee said. *This is not investment advice.

37221174,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51366,1733337036,"2025’s Must-Have Cryptocurrencies: Shiba Inu, Pepe Coin, Dogecoin, & BlockDAG — Why They’re Essential for Diverse Portfolios?","2025 has the potential to be a monumental period for cryptocurrencies. With unique platforms and promising growth prospects, now is the ideal time to invest in the best cryptos to add to your collection. Crypto enthusiasts prioritise long-term growth and the highest possible returns from their selections. Among the array of choices, Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe Coin (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), and BlockDAG (BDAG) stand out as highly promising. Let’s explore these remarkable cryptos to understand their unique qualities. 1. BlockDAG Set New Records with $155M Raised in Presale BlockDAG (BDAG) has showcased a remarkable trajectory in its presale, with BDAG climbing from $0.001 in the first batch to $0.0234 in batch 26 — a surge of 2240%. This significant increase underlines BlockDAG’s strong position in the crypto market. From this presale, BlockDAG has gathered over $155 million, with 16.7 billion coins distributed, reflecting the vast interest from the crypto community. These achievements underscore the network’s dynamic growth, leading analysts to foresee a 30,000x return on BDAG, making it a top contender for 2025. At its core, BlockDAG boasts an exceptional architecture that solves the blockchain trilemma of security, scalability, and decentralisation. Unlike traditional blockchain systems that falter in balancing these aspects, BlockDAG incorporates Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) features with robust blockchain security protocols. This innovative approach ensures scalable, speedy transactions without sacrificing security. Furthermore, BlockDAG’s ecosystem is transformative, providing a low-code/no-code platform that enables users to create meme coins and NFTs effortlessly. With its pre-built templates and efficient deployment tools, BlockDAG is poised to challenge Solana’s dominance in meme coin creation. 2. Shiba Inu’s Recent 40% Increase Fuels Optimism Shiba Inu has risen by 40% this month, now trading at $0.0000254. This increase follows a 5,000% spike in the token burn rate, with nearly 60 million tokens removed in just 24 hours, reducing the supply and potentially boosting its value. Additionally, SHIB’s supply on exchanges has dropped to a three-year low, indicating a move towards self-custody and reducing selling pressure. The Shibarium layer-2 scaling solution has processed over 500 million transactions and surpassed 8 million total blocks, enhancing the ecosystem’s scalability and efficiency. Analysts believe SHIB could rally by 50% if it breaks past $0.00002800, potentially reaching as high as $0.00022. 3. Pepe Coin Bounces Back After a 27% Drop After a 27% decline from its peak earlier this year, Pepe Coin now trades at $0.0000187, with a market cap of over $7.8 billion. A slight 1.46% decrease in PEPE’s presence on exchanges, totalling 239.84 trillion tokens, indicates a trend towards longer-term user holdings. This trend might reduce selling pressure, possibly driving up prices. Moreover, notable whale transactions, including a significant purchase of 1.01 trillion PEPE tokens valued at around $19 million, signalling growing confidence from major players, potentially strengthening PEPE’s market position. 4. Dogecoin Challenges Key Resistance, Eyes Major Gains Dogecoin has recorded a year-to-date increase of over 400%. It is currently trading at $0.404, 45% below its 2021 peak of $0.7316. Crypto analysts observe that DOGE is testing a crucial resistance level at $0.40; breaking above could push its price to $0.43, while failure could see it drop to $0.36 or $0.34. Positive developments, such as the U.S. government’s creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and the introduction of Valour’s Dogecoin exchange-traded product in Sweden, have bolstered confidence among supporters. Based on DOGE’s consistent pattern behaviour, long-term predictions suggest a possible surge to $20. The Ultimate Best Crypto of 2025 The market views BlockDAG as the best crypto for 2025 due to its solid growth prospects, which crypto enthusiasts eagerly seek. Its successful presale, raising $155 million and a 2240% increase from its initial batch price, illustrates its competitive edge. With a groundbreaking hybrid architecture that expertly blends scalability, security, and decentralisation, BlockDAG is becoming the definitive centre for meme coin and NFT creation, challenging established crypto networks.

37219321,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/moth-on-solana-a-revolutionary-memecoin,1733337021,MOTH on Solana ($SOL): A Revolutionary Memecoin,"The cryptocurrency landscape is teeming with innovative projects, but some stand out for their unique inspiration. Enter $MOTH on Solana, a memecoin built around the internet's fascination with $MOTHs and their irresistible urge to become one with the lamp. The Story Behind $MOTH $MOTH's founders, Sam Thomas (United States) and Jack Galvin (Ireland), are driven by the potential of this lighthearted meme to become a major player in the memecoin world. With Sam's experience as a volunteer admin for the well-known $POPCAT meme and as an 'original whale' within its community, $MOTH aims to replicate $POPCAT's success. This connection has even attracted some $POPCAT whales to the $MOTHproject, demonstrating the power of authentic memes with global recognition. The '$MOTH meme' itself exploded across the internet in 2018, with articles appearing in mainstream publications like BBC, VICE, Yahoo, and even National Geographic. These stories explored the meme's origins, its humorous take on $MOTHs' phototaxis (attraction to light), and its unexpected cultural impact. $MOTH on Solana capitalizes on this existing popularity, transforming the meme into a cryptocurrency with the potential to empower the meme community and build a strong, engaged ecosystem—all with the sole goal of immortalizing the meme on the Solana blockchain. Beyond the Light: What Makes $MOTH Unique? While the $MOTH meme provides a playful foundation, $MOTH on Solana aspires to be more than just a joke. Here's what sets the project apart: - Community Focus: $MOTH is built by and for the meme community. Its founders understand the power of a passionate user base and aim to foster a space for collaboration and growth. The founder has personally scaled and locked liquidity as a thank-you to the community and the meme itself. - Building Utility: The $MOTH team plans to integrate utilities that benefit token holders, potentially including a holder-exclusive game that is currently in development. Stay tuned for more details. - Long-Term Vision: Sam and Jack aren't just aiming for a quick burst of popularity. Their vision extends to establishing $MOTH as a top-20, potentially even a top-10, memecoin in the long run. This commitment is reinforced by continual liquidity lockup. Where Are the Lamps? (How to Buy $MOTH ) The light may be calling you, but before you answer with your hard-earned crypto, here's a guide on how to acquire $MOTH tokens: Option A: Trading with the Friendly Trojan For those comfortable with a bit of automation, $MOTH can be purchased through the Solana Trojan bot. While the name might sound intimidating, this bot is user-friendly and facilitates buying $MOTH with your Solana (SOL) tokens. 1. Head over to the Solana Trojan bot: Access it through this link: https://t.me/solana_trojanbot (make sure you're using the official bot). 2. Fuel Your Lamp (Send Solana): Locate the 'wallet' tab within the bot and send your SOL tokens to the provided address. 3. Unleash the $MOTHs (Find the Contract Address): Type 'CA' in the bot chat. It will respond with the $MOTH contract address: C2MvcWD86peRanQAnJfiDPurs7e7CkMsnP1bHBNJvBpA. Copy this address and paste it back into the chat. 4. Embrace the Light (Buy $MOTH): Tap one of the pre-set purchase amounts or enter a custom amount using the 'buy X' command. Your newly acquired $MOTH tokens will then appear in your connected wallet. Option B: JUP - Your One-Stop Swap Shop JUP offers a straightforward way to acquire $MOTH through a decentralized exchange (DEX). Here's how: 1. Navigate to JUP: Head over to https://jup.ag/ and click on the 'Spot' tab. 2. Connect Your Wallet: Connect your compatible wallet to JUP to initiate the swap. 3. From Sun to $MOTH (Swap SOL for $MOTH): Select SOL as the source currency and $MOTH as the desired token. Confirm the swap, and voilà! You'll be basking in the glow of your new $MOTH holdings. Option C: Light Up the Exchange For those seeking a more traditional route, $MOTH is also available on several cryptocurrency exchanges: 1. Choose Your Lamp: Create an account on a reputable exchange like LBank , XT.com, or MEXC. 2. Fuel Your Flight (Fund Your Account): Deposit funds into your exchange account using your preferred method. 3. Seek the $MOTH (Find $MOTH): Locate the $MOTH trading pair and initiate your trade to acquire your desired amount of $MOTH tokens.

The crypto world can be a bright place, but it's always wise to proceed with caution. Shining a Light on the Future $MOTH on Solana brings a touch of humor to the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies by tapping into the relatable appeal of the $MOTH meme.

37220026,https://cryptonews.com/?p=316260,1733336942,Why Are XRP and Cardano Going Up? This Low Cap Utility Token Blasts Past $2M In ICO,"Two leading altcoins, XRP ($XRP) and Cardano ($ADA) are both surging this week despite only moderate advances by market leaders Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH) . In the last seven days, Ripple’s payments focused XRP blew up 78.5% to trade at $2.56. This brings it about 25% short of surpassing its former all-time high (ATH) of $3.40, posted on January 07, 2018. At its current price, XRP is the highest it has been since the token began trading on Binance back in May 2018, and it could easily set a new high watermark over the Christmas period. Source: TradingView Cardano had a similar trajectory this year, although it’s much further from setting a new all-time high. $ADA blew up 21% over the week and now trades for $1.20, which is 61.2% lower than its highest price of $3.09, set on September 02, 2021, at the height of Bitcoin’s last sustained bull run. Source: TradingView XRP and Cardano: Are They About to Bull Run? Analysts are wondering whether we’re currently looking at the start of another bull run. Historically, Bitcoin and the wider market have entered bull runs shortly after the implementation of a quadrennial Bitcoin software update called the “halving”. The halving slashes mining rewards in half, which bottlenecks the rate at which new $BTC hits the market, since miners are the ones who issue new coins. Back in April there was a new halving, and now as 2024 draws to a close, crypto prices appear to be rising. This sequence parallels the last post-halving bull run, when prices began surging around Christmas 2020, months after the execution of the May 2020 halving. Where Bitcoin goes, the rest of the market follows. As two leading altcoins, XRP and Cardano are in prime position for some sweltering rallies should a new crypto gold rush ensue. Crypto Investors Snap Up Best Wallet as Altcoin Christmas Begins Tis the season for alternative Web3 investments, and over in the presales market, one of the most promising and most popular presale coins available on sale is Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , the native ERC-20 cryptocurrency of the titular popular software wallet.

37219218,https://coinpedia.org/?p=389313,1733336934,President-elect Trump Officially Nominates Paul Atkins As The Next SEC Chair,"The post President-elect Trump Officially Nominates Paul Atkins As The Next SEC Chair appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The most anticipated question of who could be the next SEC Chair has finally come to an end, as President-elect Donald Trump in his latest Truth social post noted that he officially nominates Paul Atkins as the next SEC Chair. “I am delighted to announce the nomination of Paul Atkins to be the next Chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission,” he noted. “The Proven Leader” Trump reinforced his belief in Paul noting that he is a proven leader for “common sense” regulations. He believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of investors & that provide capital to make our economy the best in the World. He also noted that Atkins recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to ‘Making America Greater than Ever Before.’ Trump who once disapproved crypto, has now completely changed his stance, known to be a pro-crypto President has now called for a strategic national Bitcoin reserve, and has also promised to make the U.S. a “world capital” for crypto and establish a crypto advisory council. “Crypto is one of those things we have to do,” Trump said in September as he formally launched the World Liberty Financial project. “Whether we like it or not, I have to do it.” The Pro-Crypto SEC Chair Atkins was previously an SEC commissioner from 2002 to 2008, during the George W. Bush administration, and is expected to be much more amicable towards cryptocurrency interests than President Joe Biden’s SEC Chairman, Gary Gensler, who has been staunchly criticised for his hostile take on crypto and is all set to resign on January 20. Notably, Paul is the CEO & Founder of Patomak Global Partners, a risk management consultancy. As Co-Chairman of the Digital Chamber’s Token Alliance since 2017, he has worked on & studied the digital assets industry. Paul has strongly advocated for transparency & protecting investors. Mr. Atkins has been playing an active role in helping to draft “best practices” for crypto trading platforms as co-chair of the Token Alliance, which is part of the Digital Chamber of Commerce. He is also on the advisory board for Securitize, a digital asset firm that promotes the use of digital tokens. Notably, his nomination will need Senate confirmation. If the Senate confirms Atkins as expected, it will mark the start of a new era at the SEC, that will deviate significantly from Gensler’s reign. As per a Fox Business . report, Chris Giancarlo, the former head of the CFTC noted: “President-elect Trump has made a superb choice in SEC Chair. Paul Atkins is widely known for his professional integrity and intelligence. As a former Commissioner, he has enormous knowledge and respect for the agency. He will encourage technological innovation, crypto and digital finance after years of regulatory hostility. I am certain that Paul Atkins will return the SEC to its historic role in enabling capital formation and American economic growth.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/president-elect-trump-officially-nominates-paul-atkins-as-the-next-sec-chair/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37203648,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=106831,1733336737,"Only Four Wallets Hold Over 100K BTC, All Linked to Major Exchanges","Crypto Centralization? Four Wallets Hold Over 100K BTC In a striking revelation, crypto analyst HODL15Capital shared on the social media platform X that only four wallets worldwide hold over 100,000 BTC each , equivalent to billions of dollars. Interestingly, these wallets are all cold storage wallets belonging to major cryptocurrency exchanges , including Binance, Bitfinex, and Robinhood . The finding has sparked discussions within the crypto community about centralization, transparency, and the role of exchanges in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Breaking Down the Big Four Wallets 1. Binance: The Industry Giant Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, unsurprisingly owns one of these massive wallets. As a hub for millions of traders, Binance holds significant BTC reserves to facilitate liquidity and ensure seamless operations. 2. Bitfinex: A Longstanding Market Leader Bitfinex, known for its early adoption of Bitcoin trading, also maintains a cold wallet with over 100,000 BTC. This reflects its commitment to providing a secure environment for its user base. 3. Robinhood: From Stocks to Crypto Robinhood, the popular trading app that started with equities and expanded into crypto, is another significant BTC custodian. Its large holdings indicate growing interest in Bitcoin among retail investors using the platform. 4. The Fourth Wallet: Identity Unconfirmed While the exact identity of the fourth wallet was not disclosed, it is widely believed to be tied to another top-tier exchange or custodial service. The Role of Cold Wallets in Crypto Security Cold wallets, often referred to as “cold storage,” are offline wallets designed to provide maximum security by keeping assets disconnected from the internet. Why Exchanges Use Cold Wallets Security: Prevents hacking and unauthorized access. Reserve Management: Ensures liquidity for platform users while safeguarding the majority of assets. Transparency: Demonstrates the exchange’s ability to meet withdrawal demands. Criticisms and Concerns While cold wallets are secure, the concentration of such massive amounts of BTC in just a few addresses has raised eyebrows. Critics argue that this undermines Bitcoin’s vision of decentralization. Centralization in the Decentralized World Bitcoin was designed as a decentralized digital currency , aiming to reduce reliance on centralized entities like banks. However, the concentration of BTC in a handful of wallets—primarily exchange-controlled—suggests a paradox. Implications for the Market Liquidity Risks: A sudden release or movement of such large holdings could drastically impact market prices. Centralized Power: Exchanges wield significant influence over Bitcoin’s supply and accessibility. Counterarguments Proponents argue that exchanges are necessary for onboarding new users and providing liquidity. The use of cold wallets ensures the safety of funds, making these entities trustworthy custodians for the crypto community. Community Reactions The crypto community on X and other platforms has been buzzing with opinions about the report. Some users expressed concern over centralization, while others defended the exchanges, citing their role in driving adoption and market stability. Supporters Say: “Exchanges are gateways to mass adoption. Cold wallets are a sign of responsible fund management.” “It’s better to have large amounts of BTC secure in cold storage than at risk in hot wallets.” Critics Respond: “This level of concentration undermines the ethos of decentralization.” “Exchanges holding this much power is a systemic risk.” How Does This Compare Globally? While the spotlight is on these four wallets, smaller wallets also play a vital role in the ecosystem. Wallets holding between 1 and 10 BTC represent a significant portion of Bitcoin’s total supply, highlighting the diversity of holders. Institutional Holdings on the Rise As institutions like Grayscale and MicroStrategy continue to acquire BTC, their wallets further contribute to the concentration of Bitcoin holdings. This trend underscores the growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency as an asset class. Looking Ahead: What Does This Mean for Bitcoin? The concentration of over 100,000 BTC in just four wallets highlights both the maturity and challenges of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. While exchanges provide essential services, the centralization of holdings raises questions about Bitcoin’s future as a decentralized currency. Possible Solutions to Reduce Centralization Encouraging self-custody among users to decentralize BTC holdings. Increased transparency from exchanges about fund management. Developing decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to reduce reliance on centralized platforms. Conclusion: Centralization in a Decentralized World The revelation that four wallets hold over 100,000 BTC , all linked to exchanges like Binance, Bitfinex, and Robinhood, sheds light on the evolving dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. While these wallets represent security and liquidity, they also challenge the decentralized ideals that underpin Bitcoin’s creation. As the industry grows, finding a balance between centralization for practicality and decentralization for ideology will remain a critical discussion point.

The Bitcoin bull continues to add more assets to his company’s balance sheet on the back of rising institutional investments. In a recent CNBC interview , Saylor stated that Bitcoin price will soar to $180K and make a correction. Responding to a question on the asset’s volatility and expected regulatory changes, he noted that the volatility comes with its nature because it remains a 24-hour market that moves with bull peaks and panic seasons. According to Saylor, Bitcoin will surge through the roof, hitting $180k before declining to $140K. Volatility remains part of the crypto market, and traders are watching levels. “ Volatility is like fire, and some people run away from the fire but Henry Ford put the fire via a carriage created an entire industry and he gave humanity wings… Bitcoin Bulls Follow Saylor’s Lead Over the years, Michael Saylor has remained a big pro-Bitcoin executive, with his firm adopting Bitcoin into its balance sheet. As adoption soared, this strategy bolstered market sentiment, leading to more companies following a similar strategy. Currently, Metaplanet, Semler Scientific, and others have made similar moves. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy holds 402,100 Bitcoin with an average price of $58,219 per coin. This stash has attracted all categories of investors, including whales, to the crypto market. The company sold $1.5 billion worth of stock backed by $500 million worth of Bitcoin, buying $1.5 billion of the largest crypto asset. Apart from Saylor’s approach, a major upswing in whale activity remains the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This move opened a new window for traditional investment, increasing the asset’s price. BTC Holders Set New Price Target Following ETF approvals, Bitcoin surged above $73K before making a correction. However, Donald Trump’s election has become a game changer, with sentiments upswinging as users expect positive crypto laws. The market uncertainty lowered investment, driving innovation to other jurisdictions. After the election, BTC soared to $99K as bulls target a short-term leap over $100K.

37219035,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622656,1733336057,Citadel CEO Ken Griffin says he regrets not buying crypto in its bear market,"The crypto industry continues to attract key players in the financial sector who once harbored doubts. Ken Griffin, the CEO of Citadel, has voiced his regret regarding missed opportunities in the crypto market from several years back. This sentiment is indicative of a more general trend in which established financial institutions are increasingly investigating the potential of digital currencies and blockchain technology. Griffin’s regrets of failing to invest in the decentralized finance market emphasize the increasing acceptability and recognition of digital assets within traditional finance circles. More financial leaders are reevaluating their stance on these digital innovations as the industry continues to gain traction and legitimacy. An increasing number of industry leaders will probably reevaluate their strategies to incorporate digital assets, acknowledging their potential for innovation and development as the cryptocurrency market continues to expand. The journey from anti-crypto to a crypto market maker According to reports, Griffin, one of the wealthiest people in the world, has a net worth of approximately $30.4 billion and has gone pro-crypto. Griffin stated that Citadel is unable to disregard the crypto market any longer despite his skepticism. Griffin had previously dismissed cryptocurrencies as “a jihadist call” against the dollar. However, this week, he maintained that “crypto has been one of the greatest stories in finance over the course of the last 15 years.” In an interview in 2022, Griffin said , “The crypto market today has a market capitalization of about $2 trillion in round numbers, which tells you that I haven’t been right on this call.” Griffin also said, “I still have my skepticism, but there are hundreds and millions of people in this world today who disagree with that.” He added, “To the extent that we’re trying to help institutions and investors solve their portfolio allocation problems, we have to give serious consideration to being a market maker in crypto.” In addition, he disclosed that he is currently contemplating the possibility of Citadel working with the digital asset industry in the months ahead. Now, it has been reported that he regrets not having invested a few years ago when he realized that the crypto market was really working. How awful was Griffin’s anti-crypto campaign, and why is this such significant news? Citadel Securities, a market maker, is responsible for approximately 40% of the daily retail trading in the United States, making it one of the largest companies engaged in the nation’s financial infrastructure. In 2021, Griffin stated that he had failed to understand the economic foundation of crypto. Instead, he only knows the process of determining the net present value of earnings when valuing a stock and the concept of currency exchange rates on a global scale. In the same year, Griffin made headlines in the crypto space when he paid $43.2 million for a first-edition copy of the U.S. Constitution DAO intended to buy. DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization, had raised over $40 million in ether from its collective members. Other contributions came from other crypto enthusiasts and institutional investors, such as Gemini, in an effort to acquire the document. Griffin claimed after buying the copy, “The U.S. Constitution is a sacred document that enshrines the rights of every American and all those who aspire to be.” He added , “That is why I intend to ensure that this copy of our Constitution will be available for all Americans and visitors to view and appreciate in our museums and other public spaces.” Citadel’s financial standing remains strong, even in the absence of crypto investments Citadel, run by Ken Griffin, is currently on track to beat a slow year for selling commodities on Wall Street. This will boost the hedge fund’s reputation as a leader in the asset class. According to reports, Citadel’s commodities division generated approximately $4 billion in profit this year, primarily due to natural gas trading. This indicates that it is on course to surpass the previous year’s performance. Citadel’s merchant trading division, Citadel Energy Marketing, is the reason for its distinctive position. In recent years, the unit, which is overseen by former Morgan Stanley commodities chief Jay Rubenstein, has been a significant source of profits due to its involvement in physical trading, including storage and transportation. Weather derivatives and modeling are also part of the business, and they are essential instruments for natural gas trading. The profits at Citadel’s commodities unit extend its positive run. It generated more than $4 billion last year and roughly double that amount in 2022.

""He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before.""  Unlike some of Trump's other picks which seemed designed as aggressive efforts to shake up their departments, Atkins is an old-guard figure in the U.S. securities world. He's unlikely to tear apart the agency he previously served as a commissioner and has stayed connected to in his consulting work. His firm employs several former officials from the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  He will succeed outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who previously announced he'd resign at noon on Jan. 20, when Trump is sworn into office as the U.S.'s 47th president.   Under Gensler, the regulator has taken on a number of enforcement actions against crypto companies, including several premised on the idea that some crypto exchanges are simultaneously operating as unlicensed exchanges, clearinghouses and brokers. In doing so, Gensler drew the ire of much of the crypto industry.   It remains to be seen how Atkins may view these cases.

37220025,https://cryptonews.com/?p=316374,1733335876,"Donald Trump Considering Caroline Pham, Perianne Boring for CFTC Chair","President-elect Donald Trump is reportedly considering appointing Caroline Pham and Perianne Boring to lead the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), according to a December 3 Fox Business report. Perianne Boring among contenders to lead agency involved with crypto in Trump admin https://t.co/UBseFxqThb — FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) December 4, 2024 Sources suggest Boring is among the leading contenders for the role , competing with current CFTC commissioners Caroline Pham and Summer Mersinger, as well as former commissioner Jill Sommers. Perianne Boring Among Top Contenders for CFTC Chair Perianne Boring, the CEO of the Digital Chamber, has risen as a strong candidate for the CFTC Chair position. Boring’s extensive background in finance and media, including her experience as a legislative analyst in the U.S. House of Representatives, positions her as a compelling choice. While in Congress, she focused on tax policy, healthcare, and economic issues, earning a reputation as a well-rounded policymaker. Her prior role as a TV anchor, sources claim, adds to her appeal, with one insider noting that her ability to be “conversant and telegenic” could be an asset in leading the federal regulator. However, competition for the position remains fierce. Current CFTC commissioners Caroline Pham and Summer Mersinger bring substantial regulatory experience, and former commissioner Jill Sommers is also in the running for the leadership role. Trump’s Potential Impact on CFTC and Crypto Oversight News of Boring’s potential nomination would officially mark the end of the tenure for the outgoing CFTC Chair, Rostin Behnam. Behnam, who has previously expressed frustration over political roadblocks in developing crypto-friendly regulations , noted during the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) annual meeting in October that the CFTC is “handcuffed” in its ability to advance clear frameworks. CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam expressed optimism that Congress could pass crypto legislation in the U.S. following the 2024 presidential election. #RostinBehnam #CryptoLegislation https://t.co/XxiPFUEDBr — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 22, 2024 He shared optimism for legislative progress in the years ahead, saying, “I think as we look into 2025 – a new congress, a new president – that you’re likely going to see some legislation.” Trump, who is set to return to the Oval Office next month, has campaigned on enacting pro-crypto regulations. During the Bitcoin 2024 Conference, Trump emphasized his administration’s commitment to industry-friendly rules, stating, “We will have regulations, but from now on, the rules will be written by the people who love your industry, not hate your industry.” Recent reports suggest that the Trump administration plans to give the CFTC primary regulatory oversight over digital assets, shifting authority away from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Trump has been critical of the SEC’s “regulation-by-enforcement” approach and previously vowed to replace SEC Chair Gary Gensler . With indications that Trump’s administration may favor pro-crypto policies, the next CFTC Chair could play a decisive role in shaping the future of digital asset regulation in the United States.

The native token for the world’s biggest exchange rallied sharply on a day when most leading cryptocurrencies are posting moderate gains. Crypto’s $3.7 trillion market rose 0.8% overnight. Market leader and progenitor, Bitcoin ($BTC) , added 1.4% in the last 24 hours and currently trades at $95,799. Bitcoin has been rallying since the reelection of pro-crypto US President Donald Trump back in early November. However, the $1.9 trillion market cap cryptocurrency is having trouble hitting the important $100k price milestone. Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao told an X follower that he’s unfazed by the price and “ready to build.” Like any other morning, ready to build. Don't get distracted by price. — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) December 4, 2024 Earlier this year, Changpeng Zhao served four months in prison for violating Federal anti-money laundering (AML) laws. Prosecutors proved that Binance’s lapses in AML and Know Your Client (KYC) measures resulted in large volumes of illicit funds being laundered through the exchange, from international cartels, sanctioned Iranian entities and child pornographers. Richard Teng replaced CZ and has helped Binance reestablish its reputation over the year. Binance Coin is Riding the Wave, But Will it Crash? It’s not immediately clear what drove Binance Coin to rally so sharply in the last 24 hours. The exchange token’s previous high over the last three months peaked just above $680, a price $BNB hadn’t reached since June. However, the suddenness of BNB’s ascent indicates whale money moving in. This could either be from institutions or from private investors, but clearly a small number of people have bet big on Binance coin. Source: TradingView There are two signs of an impending correction. The first is the massive divergence between Binance Coin’s current price and its 30-day moving average. The second indicator is the overheated relative strength index (RSI), which is now falling as traders sell and collect profits. Amidst AltSeason, Whales Stockpile Crypto All-Stars Binance Coin’s performance highlights how bullish the market is for altcoins. Just yesterday, Internet of Things coins experienced major price surges, with both VeChain and IOTA rallying by double-digit percentages.

Although Ripple (XRP) and Stellar (XLM) keep thriving, investors have turned to a new crypto, a DeFi token, which can deliver 25x by the end of the year. The new DeFi token offers access to many features and components that make it the best cryptocurrency investment in a market where XRP and XLM are thriving. Continue reading for more details. XRP Wallet Activations Surge 10x as Ripple Expects Regulatory Clarity Based on data offered by XRPScan, the number of X RP wallet activations increased tenfold over the past three months. This development highlights a strong interest in the Ripple-affiliated token, which enjoyed a massive rally of 284% in November 2024. Notably, last month was the best month for XRP since December 2017. Since the start of November, the XRP bulls have been dominant, helping the token reach three-year highs. Although long-term investors started taking profits, the resulting pullback was short-lived as investors started buying the dip. In another bullish news for XRP, Ripple will receive regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to cater to its RLUSD stablecoin. Notably, RLUSD is pegged 1:1 to the dollar and will be introduced on December 4. XRP was trading at $2.50 on December 3, up 76.65% in the last week. Market experts believe the Ripple coin will reach $2.85 this month as Ripple’s network implements more developments. Meanwhile, investors are moving to a DeFi token due to the increased growth potential that can enable it to deliver 25x by the New Year.

By blending blockchain technology and USDC stablecoin, the collaboration delivers quicker, cheaper, and safer ways to send money to Latin America. Stellar has been making headlines for most of November 2024 as the crypto bull market intensified. As that happened, the co-founder of Stellar, Jed McCaleb, commented on the network’s huge growth. He claimed that the platform can process 10x more daily transactions than Ethereum. With all these developments, XLM’s price has enjoyed bullish trends, recently hitting $0.6395 before retracing to $0.5591. The technical indicators show potential cooling, with increased support at $0.4815 and $0.3997. XLM was valued at $0.5022 on December 3, 2024, gaining 12.52% in the last week. Market experts believe XLM will continue surging to $0.5815 in December as buying pressure increases. Despite the bullish movement in XLM, investors have turned to a new DeFi token, which is considered the best cryptocurrency investment due to its massive profit potential. DTX Exchange: A DeFi platform changing crypto trading with 120,000 assets DTX Exchange is a new crypto platform that is creating buzz in the sector during the current bull run. The DeFi token has performed impressively and has become one of the best crypto investment options due to its growth potential. Interestingly, DTX Exchange is not like most other trading platforms that support trading services only for particular assets like stocks, commodities, indices, and bonds. DTX Exchange provides users with over 120,000 assets in its portfolio, including cryptocurrencies. Supporting a wide portfolio of assets means that DTX Exchange is linked to the $714.7 trillion OTC derivatives market responsible for the new crypto’s massive growth potential. With all these assets available, it becomes easy for traders to handle many assets without switching between accounts or trading platforms. Privacy is enhanced on DX Exchange because of its no-KYC policy, meaning that users transact without having to reveal their identity. This method also assists in meeting traders’ needs and is perfect for users looking for quick and easy registration. DTX Exchange has dominated the crypto industry since its launch. The DeFi token offers an advanced investment concept and remarkable market performance, although it is still in its presale stage. In that context, DTX’s presale has raised over $9 million, and market experts believe it will surpass $12 million by the end of 2024. With all these features and massive growth potential, DTX Exchange improves users’ trading experiences and offers attractive incentives for the DeFi token holders. The platform will become an investment hotspot because of the many innovations, massive privacy, and access to a wide array of assets. Thus, the DeFi token can deliver up to 25x gains by New Year. The DTX DeFi token could deliver 25x gains by new year, say experts The crypto market has been making headlines in the investment space with massive games that have attracted increased demand. Leading the pack is Ripple, supported by developments in its network together with Stellar, which enjoys high-profile partnerships. However, none of them can compete with this new crypto, DTX Exchange, which has massive growth potential. The DeFi token is thriving in its presale as more investors rush to buy, resulting in an accelerated adoption rate. Currently, in Stage 6 of its public presale, DTX is valued at $0.12, a 500% ROI for early investors who purchased the new crypto at $0.02.

The TGR Group, believed to be led by Ukrainian national George Rossi, used cryptocurrencies — including Tether (USDT) — to help clients, including Russian oligarchs, ransomware gangs and international crime syndicates, obfuscate their illicit activities via a variety of money laundering techniques (including the in-person trading of cash for cryptocurrency and pre-paid credit cards) in order to get around international sanctions, according to a Wednesday press release from the Treasury Department. Tether, the issuer of the dollar-pegged stablecoin, froze $8 million worth of tokens held in more than 30 wallets on the same day.    “Through the TGR Group, Russian elites sought to exploit digital assets — in particular U.S. dollar backed stablecoins — to evade U.S. and international sanctions, further enriching themselves and the Kremlin,” Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley Smith said in a statement. “The United States, alongside our allies and partners, remains committed to disrupting any effort by Russia to use digital assets or other illicit financial schemes to accrue, store and transfer their ill-gotten gains.”    The sanctions are the result of a joint investigation with the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency (NCA), the government of the United Arab Emirates and two other U.S. agencies — the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The investigation, dubbed Operation Destabilise by the NCA, has resulted in more than 80 arrests and the seizure of more than $25 million in cash and cryptocurrency.    Rossi and two of his associates — Russian national Elena Chirkinyan and Latvian national Andrejs Bradens — were included in Wednesday’s sanctions. Two other Russians tied to already-sanctioned Ekaterina Zhdanova (the leader of the Russian money laundering operation The Smart Group), Khadzi-Murat Dalgatovich Magomedov and Nikita Valdimirovich Krasnov, were also sanctioned.    The entities sanctioned include three controlled by Rossi and Chirkinyan: TGR Partners, the main Moscow-based entity, a U.K. entity called TGR Corporate Concierge LTD, a UAE-based company called TGR-DWC-LLC.    The other sanctioned entities — Thailand-based electronics expert Siam Expert Trading Company Limited and Sheridan, Wyoming-based Pullman Global Solutions LLC — are controlled by Bradens.    Tether blacklisted over 30 wallet addresses containing more than $8 million collectively on Wednesday, though a representative for Tether declined to comment on “individual cases” when asked whether the newly blacklisted addresses were tied to TGR Group.    “Tether unequivocally condemns the illegal use of stablecoins and is fully committed to combatting illicit activity,” the spokesperson added. “With Tether, every action is online, every transaction is traceable, every asset can be seized and every criminal can be caught. The fact that this operation was shut down is testament to the traceability and apprehension of criminals and their illicit use of USDT.”    In October, the Wall Street Journal reported that Tether was being probed by the U.S. government for potentially violating sanctions and anti-money laundering rules.

37218375,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=106849,1733335416,"Trump Administration Expected to Ease Crypto Regulations, Paving the Way for Crypto IPOs","Trump Administration Poised to Relax Cryptocurrency Regulations The election of Donald Trump as U.S. President is expected to usher in significant changes to cryptocurrency regulations, potentially benefiting major players in the crypto space. According to Barron’s , the administration may adopt a crypto-friendly stance , paving the way for initial public offerings (IPOs) by companies such as Circle and Kraken . With the anticipated appointment of crypto advocate Paul Atkins as SEC Chair, industry experts foresee a shift in policies governing stablecoins , crypto assets , and the broader digital currency ecosystem. What Eased Crypto Regulations Could Mean 1. IPO Opportunities for Crypto Firms Companies like Circle and Kraken have long sought IPO opportunities but faced regulatory hurdles under the SEC’s cautious approach. A more lenient regulatory environment could: Facilitate IPO filings. Increase institutional participation in the crypto market. Encourage innovation by reducing compliance barriers. 2. Relaxed Stablecoin Policies Stablecoins like USDC and Tether are integral to the crypto ecosystem, yet they have been under intense scrutiny. The Trump administration’s potential easing of stablecoin regulations could: Encourage innovation in the stablecoin sector. Provide clearer guidelines for issuers. Foster greater adoption in both retail and institutional markets. 3. Favorable SEC Stance on Crypto Under the anticipated leadership of Paul Atkins, the SEC may adopt a less restrictive approach to: Spot ETFs: Expanding beyond Bitcoin to include other cryptocurrencies. Crypto Custody: Simplifying compliance for custodians handling digital assets. Tokenized Securities: Facilitating new methods of raising capital. The Trump Administration’s Track Record on Crypto The Trump administration’s earlier tenure displayed mixed attitudes toward cryptocurrency. While former President Trump was vocal about his skepticism of Bitcoin, his administration oversaw: Increased blockchain initiatives. Proposals for crypto tax clarity. Early frameworks for stablecoin regulations. With Trump’s return to office, analysts expect a stronger focus on crypto innovation, driven by a growing acknowledgment of the industry’s potential economic impact. Industry Reactions and Expert Insights Optimism Among Crypto Advocates Crypto proponents have welcomed the prospect of eased regulations, seeing it as an opportunity to advance adoption and innovation. “This could be the turning point for U.S. crypto dominance.” – Anonymous Blockchain Expert “Easing restrictions on IPOs will bring credibility and funding to crypto companies.” – Market Analyst Caution from Regulators Critics warn that over-relaxation could lead to: Increased risks for investors. A rise in fraudulent projects. Reduced consumer protections. What This Means for the Crypto Market 1. Boost to Market Confidence A crypto-friendly regulatory environment could attract new investors and fuel market optimism. 2. Accelerated Institutional Adoption Relaxed rules may lower barriers for institutional players, encouraging deeper engagement with crypto assets. 3. Global Competitiveness As countries like Hong Kong and the UAE adopt crypto-friendly policies, the U.S. risks falling behind. Regulatory easing under Trump could position the U.S. as a global leader in the crypto space. Challenges Ahead While the Trump administration is expected to ease regulations, challenges remain: Regulatory Balancing Act: Striking a balance between fostering innovation and protecting investors. Public Perception: Addressing concerns over cryptocurrency’s association with fraud and volatility. International Competition: Competing with global hubs already embracing progressive crypto policies. Conclusion: A New Era for U.S. Crypto Policy? The expected relaxation of cryptocurrency regulations under the Trump administration signals a potential turning point for the industry. From enabling IPOs for firms like Circle and Kraken to revising stablecoin policies , these changes could unlock new opportunities for growth and innovation. While optimism is high, industry players must remain vigilant to ensure that progress is balanced with the necessary safeguards.

The Rexas Finance (RXS) presale focuses on real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation, such as real estate and gold. Since its launch, it has raised $13.7 million. In comparison, the BlockDAG (BDAG) presale has been an overwhelming success, with over $155 million raised, marking a 2240% increase in value. BlockDAG uses directed acyclic graph (DAG) technology to revolutionise decentralisation. Let’s examine what sets these two projects apart and how they change the crypto landscape. Rexas Finance: Tokenizing Real-World Assets Rexas Finance offers an innovative solution to bridge the gap between traditional assets and blockchain technology. Its goal is to tokenise real-world assets such as real estate, art, and precious metals like gold. By doing so, Rexas aims to make these investment opportunities accessible to a broader audience beyond just the wealthy. The platform’s user-friendly Token Builder lets anyone tokenise their assets without needing any technical knowledge. Furthermore, Rexas’ Launchpad supports new DeFi projects, providing tools for creators to raise capital and help expand blockchain adoption. Rexas offers flexibility for diverse use cases, from property ownership to fractional art investment. With over 217 million tokens sold, the Rexas Finance presale has raised $13.7 million so far. A forecasted 170% return entices early participants before the token is officially launched. However, despite its promise, Rexas Finance’s focus on a niche market like RWA tokenisation may limit its scalability compared to BlockDAG, which targets a much wider range of users with its blockchain technology and ambitious plans. BlockDAG: Breaking Records with $155M Raised and 2240% Surge BlockDAG has splashed the crypto market, raising over $155 million and selling 16.6 billion coins in its presale. Currently in Batch 26, BDAG coins are priced at $0.0234, already showing a massive 2240% surge. These outstanding numbers demonstrate that traders and developers are flocking to BlockDAG for its scalability, speed, and decentralisation. BlockDAG’s success goes beyond hype; its DAG technology allows for high scalability, fast transactions, and a decentralised structure that meets future demands. The ongoing mainnet dev audit, after a successful test net launch, shows BlockDAG’s dedication to delivering practical, scalable solutions. Some analysts are predicting that BDAG could reach $1 by 2025, making this an appealing opportunity for those looking for long-term stability. Why BlockDAG is Gaining More Attention Than Other Presale? Rexas Finance’s $13.7 million in presale revenue is commendable, but it is no match for the $155 million raised by BlockDAG and the 16.6 billion coins already sold. Traders are placing their confidence in BlockDAG due to several key reasons: Massive Growth Potential: BDAG is expected to reach $1 by 2025, potentially offering more than 4,200% return on the current price of $0.0234. For example, a $500 purchase today could grow to over $21,350, making it an appealing prospect for traders. 2. Proven Technology: BlockDAG has already demonstrated its capability with a successful testnet and ongoing mainnet audit. This shows that the project is not just another speculative idea but a proven, functioning network. 3. Community-Focused Development: BlockDAG emphasises its community, offering transparency and celebrating milestones. With a strong ecosystem, everyone, from small traders to larger entities, can benefit. BlockDAG vs Rexas Finance: The Numbers Are Clear Rexas Finance’s presale has been impressive, but it falls short compared to BlockDAG’s remarkable achievements. While Rexas raised $13.7 million and sold 217 million tokens, BlockDAG has raised over $155 million and sold 16.6 billion coins. BlockDAG’s Layer 1 blockchain stands out for its speed, security, and scalability. With the price currently at $0.0234 per coin and predictions pointing to $1 by 2025, BlockDAG represents one of the most promising opportunities in the crypto space for traders seeking both immediate gains and long-term growth. Who Leads Presale Battle Both Rexas Finance and BlockDAG are offering unique prospects in the crypto world. While Rexas focuses on tokenising real-world assets, which may appeal to a niche market, BlockDAG’s broad technology and unmatched presale performance make it the leader in this comparison. With a $155 million presale raise, 16.6 billion coins sold, and a 2240% price increase, BlockDAG is one to watch. The numbers speak for themselves—BlockDAG’s ecosystem and technology provide huge potential for traders looking for long-term value.

As the cryptocurrency market prepares for its next bullish phase, experts point to two standout projects for parabolic breakout — Ripple (XRP) and the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token . WallitIQ (WLTQ): Redefining the Future of Crypto Investments With its cutting-edge AI-driven platform designed to support smarter investment decisions, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is making waves in the crypto market. The project’s unique blend of artificial intelligence, advanced security features, and user-centric tools sets it apart from the competition, prompting increased demand for the WLTQ token and positioning it as a top contender for a parabolic breakout. One of WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) standout features is its AI-powered portfolio management system , which analyzes user holdings to provide tailored recommendations. This allows investors to improve their asset allocation and manage risks more effectively, a tool that has already drawn significant attention from seasoned and novice crypto traders alike. The DeFi wallet platform prioritizes security with AI-driven anomaly detection that monitors wallet activity in real-time. WallitIQ (WLTQ) guarantees that users’ digital assets remain protected. In addition, if you’re looking to grow wealth from crypto, investing in the WLTQ token presale presents a unique opportunity for massive returns if you join early adopters and buy right now at the discounted price of $0.0171. With WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) predictive analytics technology, users can use AI and machine learning to predict market trends and prepare for projected price surges. Coupled with staking opportunities that boast up to 180% APY returns, the platform provides a lucrative opportunity to generate passive income. With its CoinMarketCap listing and a smart contract audit by SolidProof guaranteeing transparency, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has positioned itself as a trusted and innovative investment in the crypto market. The WLTQ token is currently available at an initial price of $0.0171 in the first stage of its ongoing presale. With over 1.4 million WLTQ tokens already sold out and stage 2 closing in at an expected price of $0.0243, now is the best time for you to join savvy investors staking a claim for huge profits by buying massive amounts of the tokens. The anticipated listing price of $0.0860 promises a potential 400x return on investment (ROI). Ripple (XRP): Poised for a Parabolic Breakout Ripple (XRP) remains a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency world, continuing to redefine cross-border payments with its fast, low-cost solutions. After a series of legal battles with the US SEC, Ripple (XRP), currently trading at $1.52, has gained renewed investor confidence, and experts are predicting a parabolic breakout for Ripple (XRP) in the upcoming bull market. Ripple (XRP) has consistently stood out from meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Ripple’s (XRP) blockchain technology enables nearly instant and cost-effective transactions, making it a preferred choice for financial institutions globally. As adoption grows, many experts predict a parabolic breakout that could see XRP surge toward the $10 mark. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB): Meme Coins Struggle for Momentum Meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) were once celebrated for their parabolic breakouts but have since struggled to maintain consistent growth in 2024. Both tokens rely heavily on community engagement and celebrity endorsements, which have become less influential in driving sustained rallies. Dogecoin (DOGE), initially propelled by Elon Musk’s tweets, has shown resilience and is currently trading at $0.41 but lacks the technological advancements to compete with projects like WallitIQ (WLTQ) or Ripple (XRP) for a parabolic breakout. Similarly, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem expansions like Shibarium have not translated into significant meme coin price movement. Experts warn that meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) may face declining investor interest without innovative use cases as funds shift to tokens with real-world utility. While meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are not without their merits, their speculative nature leaves them vulnerable in a market increasingly dominated by practical solutions. Conclusion As the crypto market gears up for its next bullish phase, the narrative is shifting away from meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). However, Ripple (XRP) and WallitIQ (WLTQ) are capturing the spotlight with their potential for parabolic breakouts.

37219116,https://blockworks.co/news/defi-superapp-competitor-to-aave-uniswap,1733335200,DeFi superapp Fluid is coming for Aave and Uniswap’s lunch,"This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . In an open-source industry where applications can and are easily forked, “aggregation theory” — the investor thesis that the winner should build on top of and integrate as many applications as possible — caught on as a promising idea during DeFi summer . Middleware DeFi aggregators like 1inch, Matcha, Summer.fi (previously Oasis) and Instadapp have all pursued this idea to the fullest, but aggregation theory largely hasn’t panned out ( Jupiter in Solana world is an exception). Ethereum DEX aggregators have not outcompeted Uniswap, even though in theory they should. Instadapp was one such DeFi aggregator that built aggressively on top of blue-chip DeFi protocols like Uniswap, Maker, Aave, Compound and Curve. After two years in development, Instadapp has reinvented itself. From being the builders of a classic aggregator product, Instadapp has evolved into a platform with a full-fledged DeFi product: Fluid , while the original Instadapp sits separately as a yield aggregator product. Instadapp’s pivot has been quite successful: Fluid currently has $1.2 billion in TVL across its money market, while the Fluid DEX on Ethereum is seeing about $428 million in 7-day trading volumes — currently the third-largest DEX behind Curve and Uniswap. Let’s backtrack for a minute. What is Fluid? The first thing to know is that Fluid is not one app, but a superapp ecosystem. Fluid’s pooled liquidity layer forms the foundation of the protocol, on top of which sits its own DEX ( launched in early November), money market and other vault applications. Fluid’s suite of applications borrows aggressively from many of DeFi’s market-tested primitives such as Uni v1’s auto rebalancing, Uni v3 concentrated liquidity, Aave’s utilization rate curves, Maker vault’s debt ceilings and more. But it also brings to the table a slew of original DeFi innovations — namely more capital-efficient ways of liquidity provision — through its “smart collateral” and “smart debt” features. For instance, smart debt lets borrowers denominate their debt into trading pairs as liquidity for a Fluid DEX trading pool. By doing so, traders on Fluid DEX can trade between assets on somebody else’s debt. From the borrower’s perspective, you can maintain an active loan while simultaneously earning fees from traders to offset your original debt, thereby making debt a productive asset. In sum, “smart debt” creates liquidity in an entirely opposite direction by which LPs seed liquidity in an AMM pool (i.e., deposit liquidity in two tokens and receive an LP token). Smart debt has allowed trading pools like USDC-USDT with $20 million of liquidity to emerge on Fluid DEX, while technically being worth $0 in TVL. “Smart collateral” on the other hand allows LPs to take their LP positions from lending, and rehypothecate them as collateral for AMM liquidity on the Fluid DEX. This allows LPs to earn DEX trading fees on top of lending fees. This is not technically new — DEXs in the past, such as Cream Finance, have experimented with enabling the use of LP tokens as collateral — but Fluid is managing to execute it more efficiently. “In Fluid DEX v2, we plan to allow users to select their ranges on both collateral and debt, which will be a breakthrough,” Instadapp chief operating officer DMH told Blockworks. Fluid’s governance is governed by the INST token. The token has historically languished as a dead token, until a recent 4x pump in the last month. Source: Coinmarketcap A new governance proposal published yesterday is seeking to convert INST to FLUID at a 1:1 ratio without any dilution or total supply changes. Upon hitting a target of $10 million in annualized revenues, Fluid will commence a token buyback program to create value accrual for the token. Finally, the proposal also wants to spend 12% of tokens to fund growth initiatives like pursuing CEX listings, market making and fundraising and seeding an additional 5% of tokens for FLUID liquidity across DEXs.

Armstrong blasted the law firm Milbank LLP for hiring Gurbir S. Grewal, a former director of the Division of Enforcement for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Grewal brought more than 100 enforcement actions against crypto firms in his time as an SEC regulator. Armstrong says Coinbase will never work with Milbank while Grewal is employed at the firm. “We’ve let all the law firms we work with know, that if they hire anyone who committed these bad deeds in the (soon to be) prior administration, we will no longer be a client of theirs. Senior partners at these law firms seem unaware of the crypto industry’s position on this.” Armstrong claims the restrictions he’s advocating for don’t count as “cancel culture,” however. “It’s an ethics violation in my book to try and unlawfully kill an industry while refusing to publish clear rules. If you were senior there, you cannot say you were just following orders. They had the option to leave the SEC and many good people did. It was not a normal SEC tenure. They can go work in other areas (I don’t believe in permanently canceling people), but we as an industry should not be putting money in their pocket after the abuse.

37218260,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622612,1733334890,XRP’s meticulous 80% rise in 7 days: Is Forbes’ ‘Zombie Token’ list the next inverse fund bet?,"XRP is up and Forbes’ earlier report has stirred up the crypto community. The report labeled some top cryptocurrencies, including XRP, as “zombie tokens.” In a list of about 20 tokens, they said that the assets have little to no utility beyond speculative trading. The recent surge in crypto prices, including XRP’s 80% rise in just one week has led to critics mocking Forbes and highlighting the resilience of these so-called “zombie” projects. Forbes March article stirs up the crypto community Back in March, Forbes published a report calling out a list of cryptocurrencies, including XRP , as “zombie tokens.” They dubbed cryptocurrencies that are active and traded without any meaningful purpose “zombies.” The media claimed that XRP and other tokens are just used for speculative trading. Forbes argued that while tokens like XRP trade billions of dollars daily, they lack real-world use cases or adoption. Forbes also noted that traditional banking systems like SWIFT remain dominant, challenging the market space that Ripple has been trying to claim through cross-border payment solutions. However, the paper suggested that new blockchain-based systems are more efficient than what Ripple has to offer . The report referred to at least 20 such “zombie” projects, collectively valued at $116 billion. Forbes said that since these are not traditional companies, the said “zombie” projects have no obligations to the shareholders or regulators. However, in the last quarter where crypto prices have recorded a steep rise , the “zombie” tokens have recorded massive gains. And naturally , the crypto community is now mocking Forbes for its article. The crypto community argues that even if these tokens were labeled as “zombies,” their rising market values suggest that investors still see them as valuable. The backlash is more to do with Forbes’ underestimation of their staying power and relevance. In March this year, Forbes selected 20 ""zombie tokens"", with XRP at the top, referring to assets that have little use other than speculative trading. However, the recent surge in the market value of zombie tokens has also caused the community to mock Forbes.… pic.twitter.com/uhiwHpNJYF — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 4, 2024 Apart from Ripple’s XRP, Forbes identified 19 “good-for-nothing” “zombie tokens” which included major names like Cardano (ADA), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Other tokens such as Ethereum Classic (ETC), Stellar (XLM), and Algorand (ALGO) were also labeled as zombies, alongside newer projects like Kaspa (KAS), Stacks (STX), and Internet Computer (ICP). Arweave (AR), MultiversX (EGLD), Mina (MINA), and Tezos (XTZ) were also included for their perceived dormancy. Forbes market recommendations could start an inverse fund Journalist Colin Wu curated a list of returns of these tokens. XLM leads with a 466.13% rise, followed by XRP at 414.54%, and ALGO at 406.19%. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, XRP has surged by 317.54%, while XLM and ADA recorded impressive gains of 294.43% and 103.84%, respectively. XRP recorded an impressive return of almost 80% in the past week as per calculations by CoinGecko. EGLD and MINA, show negative YTD performance despite recent short-term gain. But almost all of these projects are participating in the crypto bull run without losing relevance. A user went ahead to compare Forbes to Jim Cramer, the host of CNBC’s Mad Money. Cramer has gained a reputation for being so inaccurate about the markets that there is an Inverse Cramer Tracker ETF (SJIM). The fund takes a position contrary to his recommendations and has performed well so far. XRP and other tokens on Forbes ‘ list Interestingly, Forbes included Kaspa on the zombie list. Users on X were quick to point out that the paper has been publishing its “how to buy” guides for these tokens. Forbes seems to be balancing different points of view on its platform. But , its earlier criticism of 20 tokens hasn’t gone down well with the crypto community. While Forbes questioned their utility, the market presented the unwavering interest of investors. Whether driven by speculation or long-term potential, these tokens have shown that their relevance is far from over.

As of this writing, the price of TRX is $0.4009, with the token surpassing a record $36.7 billion market capitalization. TRX’s previous all-time high was $0.23, set in January 2018. TRX is now up 99% on the weekly chart and over 279% year-to-date. The token’s sharp rally comes amid a broader altcoin uptick even as Bitcoin and Ethereum remain largely flat. What’s Fueling TRX’s Parabolic Surge? TRX’s parabolic rise has been fueled by Tron founder Justin Sun’s high-profile actions, including becoming the biggest investor in Donald Trump’s crypto project after investing $30 million in World Liberty Financial (WLFI) tokens. Sun was also reportedly named as an advisor to the Trump-backed DeFi project. Additionally, Sun shelled out 6.2 million to purchase Maurizio Cattelan’s renowned duct-taped banana artwork “Comedian”, which he recently chomped down on during a press conference. This move has sparked community engagement and indirectly boosted TRX’s price. According to some observers, Tron’s all-time highs followed political upheaval in South Korea as President Yoon Suk Yeol declared emergency martial law — a first in the country in over 40 years. The measure, which Yoon announced in a late-night television speech, came alongside allegations that South Korea’s main opposition party was sympathizing with North Korea. “When martial law was in effect, all the Korean exchanges collapsed. It seems like all the coins are leaving the country for overseas exchanges,” X user Toy wrote . “Tron is skyrocketing.” Will TRX Continue To Pump? Popular analyst Javon Marks has suggested that the TRX rally is far from over, predicting an explosive move to the $1.11 level. “$TRX (TRON) continues HEAVILY on what can be soon noted as a historical bullish move, but prices, by Logarithmic Measured Movement, can be far from done! These prices could be headed right to the $1.11 area in another >369% climb,” he quipped in an X post. $TRX (TRON) continues HEAVILY on what can be soon noted as a historical bullish move but prices, by Logarithmic Measured Movement, can be far from done!

37217978,https://finbold.com/?p=216939,1733334580,Here’s why XRP could crash soon,"Ripple’s XRP has had a remarkable performance in November and early December 2024, earning investors’ attention and deployed capital. However, different indicators suggest that XRPL’s native token could soon experience a corrective crash, raising alerts in the trading community. On December 3, XRP achieved an all-time high (ATH) market cap of $165.74 billion at $2.90 per token despite trading at a discount from its all-time high price of $3.40. Notably, this rally placed XRP as the third most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, surpassing Solana ( SOL ) and Tether’s USDT. XRP daily market cap chart (1D). Source: TradingView / Finbold / Vini Barbosa The ATH capitalization suggests a peak demand over XRP’s significant circulating supply inflation through Ripple’s ongoing unlocks and selling activities. Ripple, which is, by far, XRP’s largest holder, has recently prepared what could be its last dump in 2024 . As demand peaks and retail turns its attention to the 2012-launched digital asset, technical indicators suggest greed and incoming fatigue. Technical indicators suggest XRP could crash soon In particular, XRP’s daily relative strength index ( RSI ) broadcasts a clear overbought condition above 75 points since November 11. During the all-time high market cap, the RSI peaked at 95 points, which is usually a relevant warning. The weekly RSI shows a similarly concerning signal that XRP could soon experience an overdue correction, now marking 91.17. Interestingly, the last time XRP’s weekly RSI marked such an overbought position, the token crashed nearly 80% from November to December 2020, reaching a local bottom at $0.1713 after topping at $0.788.

This opens doors for a potential long squeeze that could cause XRP’s price to crash, seeking support downwards. However, XRP could still find the strength to continue pushing upwards despite these signals, as it has done before.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Bitcoin nears $100K as traders eye altcoins like PCHAIN, poised for a 33,102% surge at just $0.004. Table of Contents The Bitcoin price nears $100k as this cheap altcoin prepares for a 33,102% surge The driving factors behind PCHAIN’s surge to 33,103% PropiChain’s quest to power the future of real estate with technological innovation Conclusion As the Bitcoin price closes in on the highly anticipated $100,000 price milestone, the crypto market is ablaze with speculation, optimism, and strategic investment. While the Bitcoin price rally continues to dominate headlines, traders and investors are increasingly turning their attention to cheap altcoins with massive growth potential. This dual narrative of Bitcoin’s dominance and altcoin hunting defines the current phase of the crypto market cycle. The $100,000 milestone in the price of Bitcoin reflects the renewed wave of optimism in the crypto market. However, as the Bitcoin (BTC) price surges towards the $100,000 mark, market analysts have identified a cheap altcoin witnessing an influx of investors. According to these analysts, one of the cheap altcoins, PCHAIN , currently priced at $0.004, is poised for a 33,102% surge. The focus on cheap altcoins highlights a growing trend of decentralization and niche-market solutions within the crypto ecosystem. As the Bitcoin price leads the charge, one of the leading cheap altcoins, PCHAIN, market’s potential for explosive growth adds a layer of opportunity for those willing to venture beyond the mainstream. You might also like: ADA at $1 vs. PropiChain’s 18,000% prediction: Both compete to yield higher returns The Bitcoin price nears $100k as this cheap altcoin prepares for a 33,102% surge Several factors, including growing institutional adoption and rising retail interest, fuel the Bitcoin price surge toward $100,000. As the BTC narrative as “digital gold” continues to resonate with investors seeking a hedge against economic uncertainty, its journey to $100,000 is only a matter of time. From a technical standpoint, the Bitcoin price has displayed resilience. It has consistently broken key resistance levels while maintaining strong support. Analysts highlight the role of the Bitcoin halving cycle, where the reduction in mining rewards historically precedes significant price surges. However, as the Bitcoin price dominates the market, its rising price may deter new retail investors, prompting a shift in focus toward cheap altcoins like PCHAIN. With top analysts projecting this emerging cheap token, PCHAIN, could rise by 33,102%, it has emerged as a top alternative for investors seeking low-risk and high-reward assets. Historically, altcoin seasons have followed the Bitcoin price major rallies, with capital flowing into smaller assets as investors seek higher returns. The possibility of a 33,102% surge in PCHAIN captures the desire of many traders. The driving factors behind PCHAIN’s surge to 33,103% While the Bitcoin price surge to $100,000 has investors and retail traders hunting for cheap altcoins, PCHAIN presents a good opportunity with a potential of 33,102%. Although the 33,102% price rally for PCHAIN might seem overly ambitious, fundamental factors drive the price. These factors include: Growing market demand PCHAIN is an RWA token designed to bridge the gap between real estate and the blockchain. The RWA tokenization market is projected to rise to $16 trillion , and PCHAIN is positioned to take a good percentage of the market. Investors understand the prospect of the token leading the real estate tokenization charge and what it would mean for its value. Real-world utility PCHAIN is the utility token of PropiChain, a blockchain-based real estate platform. The token is backed by the $600 trillion real estate market. This means the token is less susceptible to crypto market volatility and offers a better and safer investment option than most cheap altcoins. PropiChain’s quest to power the future of real estate with technological innovation PropiChain is changing the real estate industry by seamlessly incorporating cutting-edge technologies like smart contracts, the Metaverse, RWA tokenization technology, and artificial intelligence. The platform automates property management processes like leasing and lease renewals with smart contracts. This approach means property owners no longer rely on third parties like leasing agents. Taking innovation further, the integration of the Metaverse completely redefines how investors tour or scout properties. The platform offers immersive virtual tours using advanced 3D technology, allowing potential buyers and sellers to inspect properties remotely. This eliminates the need for in-person visits, making the property-buying journey more convenient and accessible globally. Another groundbreaking feature is using RWA tokenization technology to digitize real estate assets as blockchain-based tokens. This approach enables fractional ownership, allowing investors to purchase fractions of high-value properties rather than entire units. PropiChain also uses AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants to provide real estate investors with round-the-clock support and personalized services. The predictive market analysis AI tool delivers insights into emerging market trends. These data-driven forecasts help investors identify promising investment opportunities. PropiChain is reshaping the global real estate market by combining these unique technologies, creating a more inclusive, efficient, and globally accessible ecosystem. Conclusion While the price of Bitcoin continues to surge to the $100,000 mark, cheap altcoins like PCHAIN present the perfect alternative investment opportunity for traders. PCHAIN’s projected 33,102% price surge puts the token at the top of the list for most traders seeking monumental returns. For example, if someone invests $1000 at the current PCHAIN presale price of $0.004, the 33,102% rise would mean your $1000 investment becomes $332,020. However, interested users have to join the PCHAIN presale to enjoy such maximum profit. After the current first round of presale, the token price increases to $0.011 and $0.023 for the second and third rounds. PCHAIN is listed on CoinMarketCap , and it is gaining massive visibility from potential investors. BlockAudit , a top blockchain security company, audited the project’s smart contract and found zero vulnerabilities.

According to a blog post , PancakeSwap’s SpringBoard allows projects, developers, and creators to easily create and launch tokens on the BNB Chain without needing coding skills. This feature makes it a useful tool for experienced developers and those new to crypto. Benefits of PancakeSwap SpringBoard SpringBoard offers creators flexibility in setting up their tokens by allowing them to choose from popular trading pairs and liquidity pools, such as BNB, USDT, and CAKE. A key benefit of PancakeSwap Springboard is that it has no launch fees, making token launches more affordable. It also works with PancakeSwap’s Farm Program, encouraging more people to adopt tokens and add liquidity. Once a token launches successfully, trading on PancakeSwap Springboard has a 1% fee based on a bonding curve model to ensure fair pricing. The minimum trading fee is 0.001 BNB. Before moving liquidity to the main PancakeSwap DEX, a 2% fee is applied. This helps maintain the platform’s sustainability while providing competitive rates. By making it easier for everyone to participate, PancakeSwap strengthens its role as a leader in the DeFi space. This boosts opportunities for creators and encourages innovation on the BNB Chain. Binance Labs Invest in PancakeSwap Recall that in 2022, Binance Labs, the venture capital arm of the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, invested in PancakeSwap . As reported by TheCoinRise, the investment was made directly into the CAKE tokens. Through this investment, the VC extended its mission to facilitate the next wave of global blockchain adoption by providing technology development for Web3 transformation. Meanwhile, the strategic investment into PancakeSwap was Binance’s way of letting charity begin at home before it trickled down to startups built on other chains . Intriguingly, the investment sent the price of the CAKE token soaring remarkably. Pump.fun Token Launch Plans Notably, the new platform’s rival, Pump.fun, launched Pump Advance , a new trading terminal recently. Pump.fun, the Solana-based memecoin generation and trading platform’s new trading terminal is packed with features like charts, top holder stats, advanced filters, and live-updating threads, catering to professional traders. The platform also hinted at an upcoming token launch. The announcement of Pump Advanced and the forthcoming token launch generated significant buzz in the memecoin community. It attracted new users eager to utilize the platform’s advanced tools and upcoming opportunities. These updates are a key part of Pump.fun’s broader strategy to re-engage users following the shutdown of its live streaming platform .

As of press time, TRX trades around $0.33, marking a 20% increase over the past 24 hours. Its market capitalization has also surged from $19 billion to $36.7 billion, cementing its position as one of 2024’s best-performing cryptocurrencies. TRX seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Over the past 30 days, TRX has gained over 98%, with a 220% increase since the start of the year. What’s driving Tron’s rally? The sharp rally comes amid a broader market recovery in altcoins, even as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) remain relatively flat. Other altcoins, including IOTA ( MIOTA ), also posted significant gains, benefiting from increased trading volumes and market enthusiasm. Adding to the momentum, Tron’s founder, Justin Sun, has been at the center of several high-profile moves. These include his role as an advisor to World Liberty Financial (WLFI), supported by Donald Trump, following his $30 million investment in WLFI tokens. Sun’s acquisition of a famed banana artwork at Sotheby’s and comparisons of TRX to Ripple’s XRP have further fueled excitement around the token. Tron ecosystem thrives amid bull run The Tron ecosystem has been thriving amid TRX’s price rally. Ecosystem tokens and memes have surged by an impressive 35% on average, with some achieving gains of up to 100%, according to recent data. Standout performers include Sunlion, which skyrocketed by 139.9%; Topcat, which climbed 114.8%; and FoFar, which increased by 90.2%. In addition, according to DefiLlama , the total value locked (TVL) on Tron-based protocols soared to $12 billion, highlighting the growing adoption of decentralized applications within the network. Derivatives market signals bullish sentiment The surge in TRX’s price is supported by robust activity in the derivatives market. Data from CoinGlass reveals a significant surge in TRX’s market activity. Open interest in TRX futures jumped 90.94% to $434.78 million, while 24-hour trading volume exploded by 518.32% to $8.77 billion. Binance ‘s long/short ratio for TRX/USDT stands at 1.9949, with top traders holding a more bullish position at 2.2626. These metrics indicate that traders are overwhelmingly optimistic about further price gains for TRX. TRX Derivatives data.

Robot Musk (MUSKROBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Robot Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Robot Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Robot Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Robot Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Robot Musk by entering its contract address – KuyNyMswF1p3jYpJwNCsfeM86pnhjMb6urb3EKyNVje – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/robot-musk-muskrobo-memecoin-will-explode-over-14000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37217812,https://invezz.com/?p=2361636,1733333975,"TRX, HYPE, and MNT lead crypto gains as Bitcoin trades sideways","Bitcoin managed to reclaim the $95000 support level on Wednesday after slipping as low as $93,696 on December 3, due to political tensions in South Korea. The altcoin market on the other hand continued to see a massive influx of liquidity that pushed the overall cryptocurrency market capitalisation to a new all-time high of $3.73 trillion, up roughly 4% from the previous day. Broader market sentiment was bullish when writing, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index sitting at 80 at press time, indicating that the market remains in a state of extreme greed, even though it has failed to provide BTC the momentum it needs to break past the $100,000 mark. What’s next for BTC? Bitcoin managed to recover from the dip triggered by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declaring martial law on Tuesday on the back of institutional buying, with US spot Bitcoin ETFs recording inflows of $676 million on the day. Further CryptoQuant data shows the outflows from centralised exchanges thwarted inflows over the past 24 hours, bringing the total netflows to -10.0492K. As such, it can be estimated that long-term market sentiment around the flagship asset remains bullish. However, without any major catalysts at play, some market pundits expect BTC to trade sideways in the short term. According to analyst CrypNuevo, the downside wick on the BTC/USDT weekly chart remains partially unfilled, which he pointed out could signal the potential for a deeper retest, with targets as low as $90,000 if bearish momentum builds. Fellow trader Byzantine General pointed to an even lower target, suggesting that a retest of the $86,000–$90,000 range, expected in late December 2024 and early January 2025, remains possible if current support levels fail to hold. On the contrary, pseudonymous trader Scofield expects a breakout towards mid-December, noting that Bitcoin has been consolidating between $93,500 and $96,000 over the past weeks which he likely views as a sign of building momentum. The next major catalyst for Bitcoin is going to be a potential US Federal Reserve’s rate cut with the CME FedWatch Tool indicating a 74.5% possibility of a 0.25% rate cut during the December 18 meeting. Upon writing, Bitcoin was trading at $96,158.15 up 0.5% in the past 24 hours while its market dominance remained in the low 50s. All factors point to an ongoing altcoin season. The altcoin season index has increased from 86 on Tuesday to 88 when writing, which reinforces the narrative that alts were gaining momentum. Most of the top 99 altcoins were in green, while the leading gainers for the day posted double-digit gains. The top performers were: Tron Tron (TRX) led the highest gains among the top 100 crypto assets by market cap. The altcoin was up 46.7% over the past 24 hours and hit an all-time high of $0.431 on December 4 before settling at $0.354 at the time of writing. The surge in price has pushed its market cap to $30.49 billion up over 230% from its lowest point this year. Source: CoinMarketCap TRX’s recent rally coincides with a jump in open interest in the futures market. According to data from CoinGlass, the OI in its futures market has increased by 88% over the past day to $425 million. Such a significant rise in OI suggests a very high demand for the asset from derivatives traders who are very bullish on the asset. The altcoin has also emerged as a top performer in the DeFi sector, with its total value locked (TVL) increasing by over 50% in the past day—significantly surpassing the 3.5% and 3% changes observed in leading DeFi blockchains, Ethereum and Solana, respectively. Hyperliquid Hyperliquid (HYPE) gained 28.2% over the past day with its market cap hitting its new peak of $4.32 billion earlier on December 4. Source: CoinMarketCap HYPE’s recent rally stems from the smooth execution of its Token Generation Event (TGE) on November 29, which distributed 31% of the altcoin’s total supply to the community, worth $1.2 billion. The absence of technical issues during the airdrop and no allocations for venture capitalists or private investors have likely strengthened investor interest in the altcoin. Further user sentiment on X remains highly positive, driven by its features like the TWAP mechanism. The feature allows large orders to be split into smaller transactions every 30 seconds, ensuring a maximum slippage of 3%, hence appealing to users and adding fuel to HYPE’s rally. Mantle Over the past day, Mantle (MNT) surged 25% to an eight-month high of $1.13 earlier on Wednesday. At press time the token was trading at $1.10, with a market cap of $3.6 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $380.9 million. Source: CoinMarketCap Most of the altcoin’s recent gains came after the Ethereum layer 2 solution integrated oracle provider Chainlink’s cross-chain interoperability protocol enabling Mantle to connect with multiple blockchains seamlessly and provide a secure and reliable framework to build decentralised applications. Meanwhile, the current optimism in the altcoin market helped extend the rally towards the later hours of the day.

The CFPB’s groundbreaking decision to exempt self-hosted wallets from new regulations is revolutionizing decentralized finance (DeFi), allowing you full control over your digital treasures without the hassle of strict compliance. Spearheaded by blockchain leaders like Consensys, this development is a game-changer, solidifying the status of self-hosted wallets as top-tier tools for managing your crypto. Elevating the excitement, Donald Trump’s ambitious plan for a national Bitcoin reserve is setting the stage for Bitcoin’s dominance in the global economy.

CFPB Favors Self-Hosted Crypto Wallets in Recent Regulatory Update The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has recently set new rules for major fintech payment platforms but has deliberately exempted self-hosted crypto wallets from these regulations. Declared on November 21, this rule targets platforms transacting over 50 million US dollars annually and aims to heighten consumer protection, curtail fraud, and resolve issues related to account closures. However, by excluding self-hosted wallets from these rules, the CFPB prevents stifling the growth of Web3 innovations and allows users unfettered control over their digital assets, without imposing additional compliance demands. Blockchain advocates, including the team at Consensys, were instrumental in securing this favorable outcome, which bolsters confidence in self-hosted wallets within the evolving financial landscape. Trump’s Bold Bitcoin Reserve Plan to Strengthen U.S. Economic Strategy Former President Donald Trump’s forthcoming crypto advisory council is set to transform the U.S. strategy towards digital assets by focusing on the strategic incorporation of Bitcoin into the nation’s economic framework. This council aims to guide policy formulation on digital assets and spearhead the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve. This strategic move is intended to secure Bitcoin’s role as an integral component of the financial system, affirming the U.S.’s leadership in the global crypto sphere. The council will work closely with bodies like Congress, the SEC, and the Treasury to develop coherent regulations for the crypto industry, addressing potential economic vulnerabilities that could arise from delayed crypto adoption in the U.S. This initiative reflects a proactive approach, aligning with global financial trends to foster innovation and leadership in the swiftly evolving digital economy.

37217755,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622617,1733333649,Coinbase Assets adds Gigachad (GIGA) and Turbo (TURBO) to its roadmap,"In a streak of meme token expansion, Coinbase added Gigachad (GIGA) and Turbo (TURBO) to its roadmap. The addition arrives just days after the rapid listing of Moodeng (MOODENG) and the addition of Mog Coin (MOG) to the upcoming asset roadmap. Coinbase Assets detailed its plans to list Solana-based Gigachad (GIGA) and Turbo (TURBO), after adding the tokens to its roadmap. GIGA was considered one of the most decentralized tokens, with no overwhelming influence from whales. Turbo (TURBO) was the first AI narrative token, launched in May 2023. The asset relies on a wide social media community, which has held through periods of stagnation and drawdowns. TURBO is also the first AI agent token to be added to Coinbase. The roadmap does not engage with a time period to list the assets, though, in the case of Moodeng (MOODENG), the listing happened just hours after stating the intention. The focus on GIGA and TURBO arrives as Binance US plans to start Pepe (PEPE) trading from December 5. The addition of new meme tokens to high-exposure exchanges is extending the narrative of a meme super cycle. Coinbase targets mid-range tokens Both GIGA and TURBO are stuck in the range of $500M to $600M in market capitalization. Even the listing of MOODENG and MOG did not help the assets rally above the $1B mark, which is still reserved for fewer than a dozen tokens. In the short term, listings are giving tokens more exposure, but not dramatically altering their competitive powers. Blue chip memes still rule the roost, keeping the market above a total valuation of $121B . GIGA will be listed in its Solana-based version, with 54,022 holders. TURBO is an Ethereum-based token with 44,429 holders. The Coinbase listings come after a series of meme-friendly developments, including the launch of the PancakeSwap meme launch platform and the testing of new memes on XRPL . The addition of GIGA also supports the meme selection of influencer Murad Mahmudov, as one of the top cult memes. GIGA is expanding its influence, along with SPX6900 (SPX) , which was recently added to KuCoin. The meme listings are extending the season for those social media tokens, while the dino altcoin rally competes for attention. GIGA, TURBO already gained representation Coinbase listings add to the meme narrative but do not make a great difference for the selected tokens. The exchange focuses on already liquid memes, which are advanced in their life cycle. GIGA still relies on Raydium and may see a bigger effect from the listing when the spot market opens. The token rallied to $0.058 from a recent low of $0.042, though still under its one-month peak. TURBO peaked at $0.009 from $0.0075, a relatively minor rally. TURBO has already been exposed to OKX trading and is listed on Bitget and Crypto.com, so Coinbase will only add a smaller stream to its mainstream adoption. Both TURBO and GIGA showed increased decentralized activity after the Coinbase announcement. High-activity clusters have appeared in both cases, shifting tokens in preparation for more active trading. Neither TURBO nor GIGA have appeared in the wallets of Wintermute. The market maker is one of the indicators for the promising future of memes and has accrued some of the more prominent tokens, including those with a spot market on Binance. Coinbase shows relatively small activity for its short list of memes. The most recent addition before Moodeng was Bonk (BONK), the widely held Solana-based asset, considered a blue chip meme. Coinbase is yet to show if the new listings will generate hype. In the short term, MOODENG did not re-enter price discovery, only recovering from its local lows. Meme tokens may take a while to gain mainstream traction, as they are appealing to direct DEX users. Coinbase has long relied on heavily vetted and regulated assets, only to branch into memes with no utility. Memes retain the advantage of not being considered unregistered securities but pose a different challenge to centralized exchanges – extreme volatility and connected wallets that sniped the supply early.

Liquid staking token provider Rover and perpetual DEC platform BitPerp are also building on the Spiderchain testnet. Like other testnet environments, Aragog will allow developers to test their decentralized applications. Users participating in the testnet will help stress-test the networks, with tasks such as identifying bugs being key to the eventual mainnet deployment.

This breakout has ignited bullish momentum, sparking speculation that the token could be gearing up for uncharted territory. With strong market sentiment and increasing trading activity, BNB appears poised to extend its rally, leaving many wondering how high it can climb in the days ahead. This article aims to explore BNB’s recent breakout above the $724 level, delving into the key drivers behind its bullish strength. it seeks to assess whether the asset can sustain its upward trajectory and set new all-time highs by analyzing technical indicators, market sentiment, and potential resistance zones BNB Breaks $724: A Key Milestone For The Bulls On the 4-hour chart, BNB is positioned above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a key indicator of its current bullish trajectory. Significantly, this alignment highlights the token’s underlying strength and suggests that positive sentiment is driving its momentum. The steady upward movement reflects growing optimism among traders, with BNB now aiming to create new highs. An examination of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals a notable climb, with the indicator reaching the 78% threshold after rebounding from a recent low of 46%.

Also, the daily chart further emphasizes BNB’s strong upward momentum, marked by the formation of bullish candlesticks as the price climbs above $724, indicating the possibility of continued gains and an extension of the rally. Its position above the SMA reinforces the positive trend, demonstrating sustained strength and market confidence, setting the stage for a continued rally. Lastly, the daily chart’s RSI recently reached 76%, indicating that BNB has entered overbought territory. This suggests a strong optimistic sentiment as substantial buying pressure drives prices higher. While this level points to the potential for more upside, it also signals that the asset may be overheating. Can The Bulls Sustain The Momentum Beyond $724? BNB has surged past the crucial $724 level, fueling a strong bullish movement. The critical question is whether the bulls can maintain this upward trajectory and bolster its value.

37217294,https://crypto.news/?p=14316262,1733333288,New meme coin set to 10x as presale hits $8.3M with 16 days left to invest,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Crypto All-Stars raises $8M+ for meme coin staking app; 16 days left to join presale at $0.0016715. The Crypto All-Stars (STARS) presale has raised over $8 million to build the world’s first meme coin staking app. At a time when tokens like Dogecoin , Pepe, and Shiba Inu are clawing significant gains, Crypto All-Stars’ utility-centric juncture has proved well-received in the market. The token presale will end in 16 days, leaving investors limited time to participate in this innovative meme coin project from the start. The presale is taking place at a fixed price of $0.0016715, but this will change to a product of supply and demand after STARS lists on the open market. Stake DOGE, SHIB, for STARS rewards Crypto All-Stars’ purpose is to add utility to the meme coin sector, which is typically fueled by speculation. Through the project’s “MemeVault,” users can lock up their meme coins and generate consistent passive rewards over time. Right now, the staking APY is 264%, but users can earn up to three times as much depending by maximizing their STARS holdings. MemeVault will support deposits for 11 of the top meme coins: Dogecoin, Shiba Inu , Pepe, Bonk, Brett, Floki, Mog Coin, Milady, Turbo, Toshi, and Coq Inu. However, it also states, “More coins will be added in the future, but these will be available on day one.” https://twitter.com/all_stars_coin/status/1861832416450716049 It will be interesting to see which tokens Crypto All-Stars adds next and how that affects market dynamics as traders rotate into tokens on which they can now generate passive income. And this setup provides the STARS token with a unique advantage. Since Crypto All-Stars users must hold as much as possible, it creates a significant demand source that will only strengthen alongside the meme coin market’s growth. More rewards with STARS staking Staking doesn’t end with the above-mentioned meme coins. Users can also stake their STARS tokens for even more rewards. We should note that although the MemeVault staking app has yet to launch, investors can stake their STARS during the presale, generating more STARS that can be used to increase their MemeVault reward APY later. STARS staking rewards will decrease as the staking pool grows, so those seeking to maximize their gains should not wait around. 25% of the token’s total supply has been allocated to presale staking, with another 20% to the presale, 20% to marketing, 10% to exchange liquidity, and 25% to the MemeVault ecosystem. Crypto All-Stars can 10x after ICO, says analyst As mentioned, the Crypto All-Stars presale will end in 16 days, and then STARS will list on the open market. There’s no word yet on whether it will be listed on centralized exchanges, but analysts anticipate an explosive market debut for the token. ClayBro underscored that the ICO is ending at the perfect time, with the crypto bull market well underway. According to the analyst, Crypto All-Stars could provide 10x gains once the presale ends. The project has also received support from other high-profile analysts. For instance, Austin Hilton recently told his 285K YouTube subscribers that it is his “favorite presale of all time.” With backing from top industry experts and a robust use case, Crypto All-Stars has the hallmarks of a token that could continue its viral spree far beyond its exchange launch. Join the presale and reach for the STARS Amidst a backdrop from the crypto bull run, there’s no telling exactly how far Crypto All-Stars can go. Right now, investors have the final opportunity to participate in this project from the beginning. They can buy STARS at presale by connecting their wallets to the project’s website and choosing the amount of tokens they want to buy and the crypto they want to pay with. Alternatively, prospective investors can buy and track the Crypto All-Stars presale using the Best West app’s “Upcoming Tokens” feature.

37220023,https://cryptonews.com/?p=316359,1733333226,"XRP Traders Rotate Profits Into Trending Meme Coin Catslap, $SLAP Price up 272% in 7 Days, CEX Listing Imminent","XRP traders have been taking profits. Among the beneficiaries is the top trending new cat-themed meme coin Catslap ($SLAP) , which is expected to announce its first centralized exchange (CEX) listing tomorrow, Thursday December 5. XRP has fallen back from $2.86 to $2.46 after a stellar pump, while $SLAP has been making new all-time highs after the introduction of new utility features and anticipation about the CEX listing. A banner ad in the Web3 crypto wallet Best Wallet, where the token has been on sale since launch, confirmed that a CEX listing would be the announcement’s subject. According to CoinGecko, Catslap ($SLAP) is the top trending coin in the US at No.3, beaten only by XRP and Bitcoin. The $SLAP token is fifth in the UK. Catslap has also taken residence in the top rankings on DEXtools’ hot pairs . The surge in Catslap popularity comes as the extraordinary climb in the XRP price succumbs to a temporary bout of profit-taking, before continuing its march higher. Catslap price blasts 272% higher in the past 7 days $SLAP’s price is up 7,556% since it launched 13 days ago, and there is plenty more upside ahead, given the project’s value-added benefits for token holders. Over the past seven days the $SLAP price has gone up 272%. To give some idea of Catslap’s potential, rival cat meme coin Popcat has been up 282,679% since its launch on Solana (Catslap is on the Ethereum chain). $100 invested in Popcat when it was listed on Raydium would be worth $282,679 today. Catslap has a utility offering that Popcat lacks, so just imagine where its price could go. It is no exaggeration to say that life-changing returns could be made because it is still early days for $SLAP. A broader dip across the crypto market took hold earlier this week, but Catslap continued to move sharply higher in that time. The rotation out of XRP is not a singular story but rather an indication that altcoin season is upon us. Bitcoin market dominance has slipped to 53.4%, the lowest level since June 2024. While BTC dominance is down 7.06%, all other coins (excluding ETH) are up 7.68%, of which meme coins like Catslap make up a significant part. Having said that, Catslap has also seen traders booking profits. At around 4am UTC $SLAP printed a psychologically significant new all-time high at $0.010, which triggered a number of whales to partially exit the market. After this healthy correction following such a steep pump, the $SLAP price has resumed its climb higher, currently priced at $0.0080. One serious slap https://t.co/WIxjg08wEb pic.twitter.com/tHewzMDCDz — Catslap (@CatSlapToken) December 4, 2024 $SLAP centralized exchange listing likely to be the first of many Catslap token traded at $0.0080 at the time of writing, with only 24 hours to go before the project announces the name of the first centralized exchange to list $SLAP . Although a Tier 1 exchange listing is probably not in the frame just yet for a token trading below a market capitalization of $100 million, whichever exchange the token hits will bring a flood of new buyers into the market. Trading on decentralized exchanges requires a certain level of knowledge and experience that can be intimidating for those new to crypto, hence the appeal of CEXs. Depending on the exact timing of tomorrow’s announcement, trading might start this side of the weekend or perhaps next Monday. All will be revealed tomorrow, Thursday December 5, and given the FOMO surrounding the feline Slap-to-Earn sensation, a break through the previous ATH is likely in the coming hours. The drawdown in the $SLAP price is already encouraging new entrants, thereby strengthening the next attack on $0.010. The unmatched utility of the meme coin and its solid market positioning has spurred some bullish confidence. At the time of writing approximately users have staked $3 million worth of $SLAP (357 million tokens) in a testament to the project’s strength and commitment of its community. In addition to staking-initiated burns, the team also burns a substantial number of tokens when the project reaches certain milestones on the Slapometer. The Slapometer had clocked up 151 million slaps as of 3pm UTC today. Catslap’s $SLAP burns: a price driver So far, about $1 million worth of $SLAP has been burned (139 million tokens), which supports the price by increasing the coin’s scarcity. The burn milestones are smashing all expectations, as the newly launched Slap-to-Earn mechanism incentivizes even more users to slap. The most recent big milestone burn took place yesterday when the Slapometer reached 100 million and the network burned the same number of $SLAP tokens, valued at $769k. Supplementing the burns is the buyback program . To date, the project has bought 57 million $SLAP tokens in the open market, valued at $459,000, further bolstering confidence and stability. The buybacks take place every 20 minutes. The latest market metrics are impressive too. $SLAP token holder numbers have smashed through 12,000 – a 1,000-plus advance on yesterday. Despite the temporary price pullback, $SLAP is still up 30% in the last 24 hours and chalking up a 245% rise over the past seven days. Reflecting the bullish price action, the SLAP/ETH liquidity pool has swollen to $6.8 million, providing plenty of headroom for more meteoric price breakouts. The Catslap community is expanding rapidly. There are now 3,194 group members on Telegram and 10,800 followers of its X account. Where to buy Catslap ($SLAP) for 40% staking returns As part of a partnership deal with Best Wallet , you can buy and stake the $SLAP token there – just head to the ‘Upcoming Tokens’ section, which is fast becoming a prime spot for finding low-cap crypto gems. Staking $SLAP tokens will earn you a 40% return providing you deposit for 12 months. However, you can stake for shorter periods, with the minimum being seven days. Stakers can unlock their tokens early by burning some of their staked balance. To purchase $SLAP token you will need ETH or USDT, but you can also use a card. Download Best Wallet from your preferred app store: Google Play or Apple App Store . Alternatively, you can buy directly from the Catslap homepage or on a decentralized exchange such as Uniswap, but using the latter option means missing out on staking. A word of warning: there are fake versions of the Catslap website, so make sure to click through from the project’s social links and always check you are visiting the correct url, which is https://catslaptoken.com/ . Catslap token runs on the Ethereum chain – all other versions are scams. Buyers will be glad to know that SolidProof audited Catslap, has a 99% project reliability score on DEXtools, and developers have locked 53% of its $6.8 million liquidity on-chain for one month – it means there’s no risk of a rug pull. Catslap is ready to pounce on the Popcats and Pepes of the crypto world in its quest for meme coin domination. This cat could have you purring all the way to the bank.

The layoffs, which affected 74 employees, reflect a strategic shift to prioritize core operations, including its Bitcoin mining pool and site operations. This decision follows an internal restructuring within the Digital Currency Group (DCG), Foundry’s parent company. CEO Mike Coyler stated that the firm is focusing on its core business lines to strengthen its market position. As part of this shift, the platform has deprioritized its custom hardware initiatives while maintaining its ASIC repair services. Foundry Cuts Jobs According to the latest report by Blockspace, the layoffs were accompanied by the transfer of 20 Foundry employees to Yuma, a decentralized AI startup spun out of Foundry’s internal Bittensor project. Yuma now operates as an independent DCG entity under CEO Barry Silbert. Foundry’s management described the changes as part of a strategy to streamline operations and refocus on its core businesses, including its flagship Bitcoin mining pool and site operations. Foundry currently accounts for 30% of the Bitcoin network’s total hash rate. Its self-mining business alone is on track to generate $80 million in revenue for 2024, as per DCG’s Q3 2024 shareholder letter. Meanwhile, other business lines, such as ASIC repairs and decentralized AI infrastructure, remain operational. In a statement, the company claimed, “We recently made the strategic decision to focus Foundry on our core business while supporting the development of DCG’s newest subsidiaries. As part of this realignment, we made the difficult decision to reduce Foundry’s workforce, resulting in layoffs across multiple teams.”. Navigating Troubled Waters The layoffs come amid broader challenges for DCG, which has worked to stabilize its operations following the bankruptcy of its lending subsidiary Genesis after being caught up in the FTX fallout. Amidst financial challenges, Foundry moved from a free model to a paid service, marking a significant change in its business strategy in April last year.

And his trading indicates that memecoin enthusiasm has reached the shores of Congress.  Collins, whose committee assignments keep him far from the core decisions on U.S. crypto legislation, has kept a busy hand in the buying and selling of digital assets. Earlier this week, Collins made small buys of Ski Mask Dog and Aerodrome (AERO) – each of the purchases categorized in the congressional financial filings as between $1,000 and $15,000.  A trucking company operator who arrived in Congress last year, Collins is among a handful of direct crypto traders on Capitol Hill. And his is the most extensive record, according to his disclosures, with 19 trades going back to November, including in Ethereum's ether (ETH), Velodrome Finance and The Graph (GRT). When his purchase of Ski Mask Dog and AERO was noted on social media site X, he responded by posting an image of Pepe the Frog.  Ski Mask Dog is another in a long series of dog-based memecoins, which are typically volatile and often humorously inspired tokens. Aerodrome is one of the biggest decentralized exchanges on Base.  Collins has an ""A"" rating from crypto advocates Stand With Crypto, noting his support of digital assets legislation including the high-profile Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21). And he's coming back next year, having earned 63% of the vote last month to defeat a Democrat challenger to earn his second term in the House.  The Georgia congressman is better known on immigration issues, including for sponsoring his own bills empowering states against the federal government.  Direct investing by members of Congress has long been a controversial topic, with critics raising the hazards posed by potential conflicts of interest and insider trading. But trading of such assets as stocks, bonds and crypto is still on the table for members of the House and Senate, though each transaction is publicly disclosed.  Former Representative Madison Cawthorn, a North Carolina Republican, had been an even busier crypto trader than Collins before he was defeated in a primary challenge in 2022.

However, this bearish or negative outlook is further getting support from large holders. Whale Dump 40 million XRP Tokens Today, December 4, 2024, the blockchain-based transaction tracker Whale Alert made a post on X (previously Twitter) that a crypto whale had dumped a significant 39.99 million of XRP tokens worth $103.18 million. This massive dump was witnessed on Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States. 39,999,989 #XRP (103,181,519 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbase https://t.co/RxWiHTHdOf — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 4, 2024 The whale’s significant dump currently aligns with a bearish price action pattern. According to expert technical analysis, XRP has formed a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern on an hourly timeframe. In trading and investing, this pattern often signals a sell-off and whenever an asset breaches the neckline, a notable price decline is typically observed on the chart. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Analysis Experts and analysts currently anticipate similar price momentum in the coming days. If XRP breaches the neckline of this bearish pattern and closes a daily candle below the $2.40 level, there is a strong possibility of a 20% decline, potentially bringing the price down to $2 in the near future. However, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 34, which is close to the oversold zone, indicating potential upside momentum. Additionally, XRP is trading above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, suggesting an uptrend. Traders Bearish Outlook This bearish outlook is further supported by on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Currently, the XRP Long/Short ratio stands at 0.88, indicating strong bearish market sentiment among traders. Currently, 53.20% of top traders hold short positions, while 46.80% hold long positions. Combining all these factors, the recent whale activity, bearish price action patterns, and bearish on-chain metrics, it appears that bears are currently dominating the asset in the short term. This suggests a strong possibility that XRP could face a price correction or decline in the coming days. Current Price Momentum At press time, XRP is trading near $2.40 and has registered a price decline of 6.5% in the past 24 hours.

37217811,https://invezz.com/?p=2361918,1733332527,VeChain (VET) hits 2-year high after VeBetterDao launch,"VeChain (VET), a blockchain platform known for its real-world applications in supply chain management and sustainability, has recently experienced a remarkable surge in both its ecosystem activity and token price. The price of VET just hit a two-year high of $0.07901, driven by innovative developments such as the launch of VeBetterDAO. VeChain price has gained 249% over the past month After years of trading below $0.07, VET on December 5 soared to a two-year high of $0.07901, after a 253% increase over the past 30 days. Although a slight correction has brought the token’s price back to $0.06877, VeChain remains one of the top performers in the cryptocurrency market at the moment. At press time, VeChain (VET) was up 62% over the past week and 249% over the past month. VeChain’s renewed momentum, which coincides with its addition to Coinbase’s COIN50 Index, which tracks top-performing cryptocurrencies, has also propelled the altcoin into the spotlight, as investors closely monitor its ability to break through the critical $0.1 psychological level. Notably, VeChain’s price resurgence aligns with a broader bullish trend among large-cap altcoins, with assets like XRP and Tron also experiencing remarkable gains. Why is the price of VeChain rising? One of the most significant contributors to VeChain’s rising prominence is VeBetterDAO , a recently launched decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that drives sustainability and real-world impact. VeBetterDAO focuses on tokenizing eco-friendly actions and promoting transparency through blockchain technology. Users are rewarded with B3TR tokens for participating in dApps that promote activities such as recycling, energy conservation, and community cleanups. Several decentralized applications (dApps) within the VeBetterDAO ecosystem among them Cleanify, Oily, Greencart, and Vyoo, are already demonstrating VeBetterDAO’s real-world utility. Cleanify rewards users for organizing and participating in cleanup efforts, while Oily incentivizes the recycling of used cooking oil. Similarly, Greencart encourages sustainable shopping habits, and Vyvo promotes health-conscious behaviours. VeBetterDAO has also forged key partnerships to amplify its impact. It has forged partnerships with entities like Molino Bruno and UFC, showcasing its ability to merge sustainability with enterprise applications. In addition, VeChain recently announced a partnership with Renji Hospital , aimed at transforming IVF services with secure, private data management. This partnership adds to the billion-dollar partnerships VeChain has entered with Walmart, BMW, Mercedes, and others, causing the network’s activity to explode. Can the VET price hit $0.1? As VeChain continues its upward trajectory, the question of whether VET can reach $0.1 has gained traction among investors. Market analysts remain optimistic, with some projecting that the token could easily surge above $0.4 if it maintained the current market trend. Beyond this milestone, ambitious forecasts place VET at $0.74 and even $1.5 to $2.06 in the longer term.

37217058,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622592,1733332471,Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin launch set for Dec 2024 – Here’s all you need to know before the launch,"Ripple is in the process of obtaining approval for its stablecoin RLUSD in New York. This implies that the cross-border payment corporation will be permitted to participate in the regulated US crypto market. This is one of the measures it is taking to demonstrate that it is regaining trust with the US authorities. The company is planning to launch the product on December 4. If approved, as expected, Ripple will be able to legally sell its stablecoin, RLUSD, to the public. This will make it a big player in New York’s regulated digital finance market and the stablecoin ecosystem as a whole. People familiar with the situation say that the New York Department of Financial Services has told Ripple that it will accept the product. More about the RLUSD stablecoin The stablecoin will be issued through Standard Custody & Trust Company, a Ripple-owned entity licensed by NYDFS. RLUSD is a 1:1 US dollar-backed stablecoin introduced in June. It is 100% supported by US dollar deposits, short-term US government Treasurys, and other cash equivalents. According to reports , the RLUSD stablecoin has been in beta testing on the Ethereum mainnet and Ripple’s decentralized public blockchain platform, the XRP Ledger (XRPL), since early August. Ripple has announced its intention to gradually broaden the scope of RLUSD to encompass additional blockchains and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. In an X post , Justin Sun, Tron’s (TRX) founder and BitTorrent owner, has hinted at his 3.7 million followers at a potential RLUSD release on Tron (TRX). The potential integration has been met with enthusiasm by the XRP army, as both XRP and TRX have experienced significant growth in recent days. Ripple explained that it is launching RLUSD to capture a portion of the stablecoin market, which is expanding at a rapid pace and is expected to reach a multi-trillion-dollar market by 2030. It is possible that it could pose a significant challenge to established participants such as Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT. According to reports, Ripple burned approximately 47 million RLUSD stablecoins in a significant token fire last week. The Ripple Stablecoin Tracker account published an announcement that 46,676,120 RLUSD tokens were burned in a single day, thereby substantially reducing the supply by removing the majority of these minted tokens from circulation. In addition, Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, recently declared that the RLUSD stablecoin will primarily be aimed at institutional investors. Moreover, to facilitate the stablecoin’s distribution, the entity has partnered with crypto exchanges and platforms, including Uphold, Bitstamp, Bitso, MoonPay, Independent Reserve, CoinMENA, and Bullish. Ripple’s supremacy battle in the crypto ecosystem On the other hand, Ripple Labs-linked XRP has been experiencing an uptick in value, reclaiming its position as the third-largest coin by market cap in early December, which is currently standing at a price of $2.57. By releasing a regulated stablecoin, Ripple will be able to provide a stable alternative to XRP for clients who wish to use digital currencies without being exposed to regulatory uncertainty and volatility. This action will also put Ripple directly in competition with other well-established U.S. stablecoin issuers, including Circle, Paxos, and Gemini. Monica Long, the president of Ripple, also stated in June that RLUSD was designed to be “complementary and additive” to XRP. XRP will mostly be used as a “bridge currency” to settle deals. In the United States, however, the token is not yet regulated because the Securities and Exchange Commission is still arguing in court that it is an unregistered security. The case, which is currently in the appeals phase in the Second Circuit, may be dismissed by the crypto-friendly Trump Administration upon its assumption of power in January. RippleNet leverages blockchain technology to offer banks and businesses cross-border payment solutions that are more efficient, cost-effective, and rapid. It is advertised as an alternative to the global bank settlement system known as SWIFT. The stablecoin’s price will be stabilized by paring to prevent de-pegging, while XRP’s significant availability on exchanges will contribute to the addition of liquidity to RLUSD. New York State Department of Financial Services’ stance towards crypto The United States SEC, under Gary Gensler, has had crypto on a chokehold of regulations during the Biden administration. Now, companies that want to offer digital assets have to meet a lot of rules. The regulations have encompassed security, privacy, and consumer protection. On the other hand, business entities in New York offer certain services related to digital assets without having to follow the stricter rules of a traditional bank by getting a limited-purpose trust charter, which is what Paxos and Gemini have done. Crypto business entities also use a “BitLicense,” which lets companies like Coinbase and Robinhood help people buy, sell, and store crypto.

Crypto’s first-ever vote-to-earn (V2E) meme coin, launched just two months ago, is already showing the investor enthusiasm needed to become the next moonshot gem in this roaring bull market. With its rapid influx of fresh capital and more pouring in each day, Flockerz is shaping up to have the same potential as Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT), which recently hit a $1 billion valuation. All it needs now is massive media coverage — which the V2E meme coin is already attracting — and a listing on a top-tier exchange, which could very well happen soon. Securing tokens during the presale is essential for investors looking to maximize returns on their $FLOCK holdings. The current price is $0.0062245 per token, but as the presale progresses through multiple funding stages, the price will increase. With the current stage ending in 24 hours, now is the time to act before the price rises. Meme coin market hits new highs, and Flockerz stands out with its V2E model The meme coin sector is once again on track to reach new heights after soaring to a $122.69 billion market capitalization on Wednesday, accompanied by a 2.74% rise in trading volume to $25 billion. Leading coins like PopCat ($POPCAT), Mog Coin ($MOG), and Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT) have surged in the past 24 hours, posting double-digit gains of 11.73%, 10.19%, and 11.23%, respectively. $PNUT is also a big story in the market because of its ascent to a $1 billion valuation, which is 135x faster than Dogecoin ($DOGE) ever did. Peanut the Squirrel Price: PNUT Live Price Chart, Market Cap & News Today | CoinGecko Indeed, animal-inspired tokens have been the story of 2024, fueling the meme coin supercycle that’s defined the market this year. But the hunger is far from fading. As the spotlight shifts from Bitcoin – still struggling to break the $100,000 mark – investors are now on the hunt for the next meme coin that they can take to superstardom. Enter Flockerz . With its flappy wings and propeller beanie, Flockerz, like $GOAT and $PNUT, breaks from the typical barking crowd of the meme coin sector. But it’s not just the fact that Flockerz isn’t another Shiba Inu knockoff that’s got early investors onboard – it’s the V2E mechanism powering it that’s really hyping the crypto crowd. Flockerz V2E mechanism sets a new standard for meme coin project governance As the only meme coin to introduce the V2E (Vote-to-Earn) mechanism, Flockerz ($FLOCK) is setting a new standard for the entire meme coin sector. The V2E feature puts the power in the hands of the Flockerz community, known as “flockers,” by allowing them to directly influence the project’s direction. Holders of $FLOCK tokens can vote on key decisions such as protocol upgrades, treasury management, and community proposals, with their votes rewarding them in $FLOCK tokens. In short, voting equals earning. This community-driven approach has immense potential. Meme coins thrive because of their communities, and by giving them the reins, Flockerz ensures real decentralization. The flocks always helping each other reach their goals! Teamwork makes the dream work! pic.twitter.com/Mk97zpMy37 — Flockerz (@FlockerzToken) December 2, 2024 Instead of a single developer whose decisions could be swayed by financial interests, the project is guided by a collective group of passionate individuals with shared wisdom and a genuine stake in the project’s success. This community governance model is indeed a game-changer and offers a solution to the rising tide of scams amidst the increasing number of tokens flooding the market. V2E has the potential to drive investors toward meme coins with strong, community-driven approaches, like Flockerz. What sets Flockerz apart is its unique position as the first to implement V2E, much like how Dogecoin ($DOGE), as a proof-of-work (PoW) coin, paved the way for a whole new class of tokens. It’s no surprise that price predictions for Flockerz are off the charts, with some experts forecasting up to a 4000x return. That means a $1,000 investment could skyrocket to a life-changing $4 million. Popular crypto influencer ClayBro dives into these incredible price predictions for $FLOCK in his latest YouTube review below: Flockerz presale: All systems go for the $5 million target this week The $4 million mark was reached in just one week, making the next target of $5 million well within reach before the end of the week. To join the V2E movement that Flockerz is pioneering, become a “flocker” by securing your share of $FLOCK tokens. Simply head to the official Flockerz website , connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet), and purchase $FLOCK using ETH, BNB, USDT, or even a bank card. Flockerz also offers a staking feature with a 558% APY, which allows early investors to grow their holdings and increase their voting power within the project. Additionally, Flockerz has been audited by Coinsult and SolidProof, both of which have confirmed zero errors in the smart contract code, ensuring peace of mind for investors.

42388918,239af55b-bb4d-46ad-ab03-c56c16ce6cff,1733332079,MSTR vs. BTC,"After the election, as everyone except for muggles know, the price of BTC rallied to all time highs (ATH) just short of $100,000. At the time of this writing, it’s hovering around $98,000. An interesting question then is: what happened to Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy (MSTR) during this period?  The publicly traded stock, synonymous with its unconventional and risk-on co-founder as well as the price of BTC, also rallied to post-election ATH — as one might expect — exceeding $500.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Then last week, it took a precipitous ~22% short selling-inspired hit based off of a report expressing concerns about the company’s valuation. The noise around the stock piqued my interest. I was curious to dig in and see what potential market opportunities might exist, or at least understand the value of owning MSTR vs BTC.  This graph is a bit misleading. The main reason MSTR has outsized gains to BTC is that MSTR is highly levered. Very highly levered. It has acquired 386,700 BTC for nearly $22 billion, which represents an unsurprising ~99.5% of its balance sheet. To achieve this, the company has raised $9 billion in debt, some with zero interest. If their BTC holdings are collateralized by this debt, they could face a challenging repayment in a severe BTC downturn. They also raised $4.6 billion in equity for these BTC purchases. With an average BTC price of ~$56,500, appreciation factors heavily into the market cap.  The correlation between MSTR and BTC is relatively high, using both Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients, at about 65% using 12 months of daily closing price data. Remove leverage and the correlation is pretty linear. Generally, follow the price of BTC and the price of MSTR will follow. The correlation is strong, but not so strong for several reasons. MSTR runs a very profitable business intelligence (BI) operation that generates annual revenues around $500 million. This makes it one of the largest players in the BI space. It’s a stock with a real business and prone to price moves based on the underlying business. BTC leverage is the key though, creating a 2.5x volatility to BTC.  Arguably, MSTR is not a good proxy for BTC and unless you’re comfortable with the increased leverage and volatility, it’s also not a comfortable investment opportunity. Just buy a BTC ETF. You can leverage BTC perpetual contracts or BTC ETFs to get a similar risk profile to MSTR. But if you want the leverage, it’s probably better to let Michael Saylor take the risk and as an investor, just own the price risk. But it isn’t a replacement.  Given the strong correlation and MSTR’s oversized exposure to BTC, is there a trade here? Let’s look at mean reversion. The dramatic MSTR rally before its big drop last week pushed the z-score to nearly four standard deviations (4σ). Looking at the graph, however, historically there haven’t been many mean reverting opportunities. A large part of this can be attributed to the recent use of leverage to add to its position, so the relationship between the two assets is now much different than before.  MSTR has the ability to sell another ~13 million in equity, which could widen the ratio further. One can conclude that MSTR is significantly overvalued to BTC and an even further narrowing of the spread could occur.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Rosenberg,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/04/mstr-vs-btc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/56619c1083405511fee0da40afb0b04c732a7247-1500x999.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

37217291,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51358,1733332006,Massive Solana ETF Developments & SEC Shifts—Is Plus Wallet the Only Tool You’ll Need for 2025?,"The crypto industry is at a turning point, facing a mix of regulatory challenges and promising growth opportunities. The SEC’s recent redefinitions of “dealer” and “government securities dealer” have triggered debates, particularly impacting decentralized projects that struggle to meet KYC and AML standards. Yet, amid these tensions, optimism is building for a Solana (SOL) spot ETF approval. Asset managers are actively engaging regulators, aiming to create new pathways for blockchain investment. At the same time, tools like Plus Wallet are emerging as essential solutions for managing digital assets securely and efficiently in this rapidly changing environment. SEC Regulatory Moves Raise Concerns On February 6, 2024, the SEC expanded its definitions of “dealer” and “government securities dealer,” introducing stricter compliance requirements. This change has sparked controversy, as decentralized projects without centralized governance often cannot meet KYC and AML obligations, leaving them vulnerable to regulatory scrutiny. Criticism has been swift. SEC Commissioners Mark Uyeda and Hester Peirce have voiced concerns, labeling the measures excessive and detrimental to innovation. Advocacy groups like the Blockchain Association have even pursued legal action, arguing that these regulations hinder U.S. market growth and technological advancement. For investors and developers alike, staying informed about these regulatory shifts is crucial for spotting opportunities amidst the challenges. Hope Grows for Solana Spot ETFs The conversation around Solana (SOL) spot ETFs is gaining momentum. Asset management firms such as Vaneck, 21 Shares, and Bitwise have initiated filings, while exchanges like CBOE prepare to take the next steps in the approval process. If successful, these ETFs could mark a significant milestone for blockchain accessibility. The SEC’s prior approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has fueled optimism that Solana’s proposal may also succeed. Combined with the potential for a more crypto-friendly regulatory approach, the current climate suggests that Solana ETFs could soon become a reality. If approved, these ETFs would offer a simplified way for investors to participate in Solana’s thriving ecosystem, potentially driving its growth further. Plus Wallet: A Smarter Approach to Crypto Management in 2025 Plus Wallet is redefining how users interact with digital assets, offering a blend of security, innovation, and simplicity. Designed for all experience levels, it delivers tools to help users make the most of their crypto investments. One of its standout features is the “Swap to Earn” program , where users earn USDT rewards for cryptocurrency swaps based on transaction volume.

37216613,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=106851,1733331814,Cathie Wood Predicts Crypto and AI Boom Under Trump’s Business-Friendly Policies,"Cathie Wood Foresees Rapid Growth in Crypto and AI Under Trump Cathie Wood , CEO of Ark Invest , anticipates a transformative period for cryptocurrency , artificial intelligence (AI) , and other tech-related industries once President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January 2025. In a recent interview with CNN, the influential investment leader expressed optimism about the Trump administration’s potential to foster innovation through business-friendly regulations , marking a significant shift from current policies. Wood believes this change could position the United States as a leader in emerging technologies, reversing the outflow of talent and capital to more crypto-friendly regions. Trump Administration’s Expected Impact on Crypto and AI 1. Business-Friendly Regulations Wood predicts that the incoming administration will introduce regulations designed to promote growth in tech sectors, particularly cryptocurrencies and AI . For Crypto: Wood criticized current policies under SEC Chairman Gary Gensler , calling them overly restrictive and counterproductive. She argued that these regulations have stifled innovation, preventing the U.S. from becoming a global leader in the crypto space. For AI: Simplified policies could encourage investment in AI startups and incentivize research and development across industries. 2. A Renewed Focus on Innovation The Trump administration’s business-friendly approach could benefit not only industry giants but also small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) . Wood emphasized that fostering growth in these businesses could unlock untapped potential and create opportunities across the economy. U.S. Crypto Leadership: Can It Be Reclaimed? Regulatory Roadblocks Under Gensler Wood cited the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ’s stringent stance on crypto under Gensler’s leadership as a major obstacle for U.S. innovation. Aggressive enforcement actions have driven crypto talent and capital offshore. Excessive regulations have hindered the ability of crypto firms to launch, scale, and innovate. Opportunities for Change With Trump’s presidency, Wood expects: Streamlined Crypto Policies: Clearer, less restrictive regulations that encourage domestic innovation. Talent Retention: Policies that attract and retain global talent within the United States. Global Competitiveness: A return to leadership in blockchain and cryptocurrency development. The Role of AI in the Next Administration AI’s Growth Potential Wood sees AI as a transformative force, with applications spanning healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. She emphasized that supportive regulations could accelerate the adoption of AI technologies and make the U.S. a leader in this domain. Synergy Between Crypto and AI The convergence of AI and blockchain technologies offers new possibilities: Decentralized AI Models: Using blockchain for secure, decentralized AI development. Enhanced Security: Leveraging AI for improved fraud detection and risk management in crypto. What Industry Leaders Are Saying Optimism for the Future Wood’s comments reflect growing optimism among tech leaders about the Trump administration’s ability to create a favorable environment for innovation. “Trump’s business-first policies could be the catalyst we need,” said an unnamed blockchain entrepreneur. “AI and crypto are the future, and with the right policies, the U.S. can lead the charge,” added a Silicon Valley investor. Skepticism Remains While many are optimistic, some experts remain cautious: Concerns about balancing innovation with consumer protection. Skepticism over whether policy changes can be implemented quickly enough to regain lost ground. Potential Impacts on Key Sectors 1. Cryptocurrency IPOs and Spot ETFs: Firms like Circle and Kraken could benefit from relaxed IPO rules. Stablecoin Growth: Clearer policies may drive broader adoption of stablecoins like USDC . Global Appeal: U.S.-based firms may attract more international investors under a favorable regulatory regime. 2. Artificial Intelligence Increased R&D Funding: Incentives for research could boost AI breakthroughs. Broader Adoption: AI integration across industries could accelerate. Job Creation: Growth in AI-related sectors may lead to high-skill job opportunities. Challenges Ahead While the potential for growth is immense, hurdles remain: Regulatory Balancing Act: Striking the right balance between fostering innovation and protecting consumers. Global Competition: Competing with crypto-friendly nations like the UAE, Hong Kong, and Switzerland. Public Perception: Addressing concerns about the risks of unregulated AI and crypto technologies. Conclusion: A Bright Future for Crypto and AI? Cathie Wood’s optimism underscores the transformative potential of crypto and AI under Trump’s administration. If the anticipated regulatory changes materialize, the U.S. could reclaim its position as a global leader in emerging technologies. However, the path forward requires careful planning to ensure that innovation is balanced with responsible oversight.

This segment helps investors deploy tailored strategies for hedging, leverage, and yield generation while providing deeper insights into market sentiment.  Crypto options markets are primarily divided into centralized exchanges and the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Recent open interest data from platforms like Deribit, CME and OKX reveals that total listed bitcoin options reached new heights in late November, surpassing USD 40 billion.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  However, ether options remain relatively underwhelming, with open interest totalling just USD 9.8 billion, down from a peak of USD 14.5 billion in March. Deribit, the leading platform for bitcoin, ether, and altcoin options, dominates the space, accounting for nearly 90% of the total open interest.  The open interest data on Deribit paints a picture of a positive outlook in bitcoin options. With over USD 19 billion in call options versus USD 9.4 billion in puts at the beginning of December, the market is clearly positioning for continued upward movement. A significant portion of this open interest — USD 5 billion — is concentrated in call options with strike prices between USD 100,000 and USD 120,000, expiring in December and March 2024 [source: Deribit]. The pronounced Call-Put skew [e.g. 25D 1month +5% on December 2nd], where out-of-the-money calls carry higher implied volatility premiums than puts, indicates strong demand for leverage over downside protection.  Centralized exchanges, with their user-friendly platforms and transparent real-time data, offer individual investors insight into market sentiment through trading activity, order flow, and liquidity. However, institutional investors are increasingly turning to the crypto OTC market for more customized solutions, greater privacy, and the ability to execute larger-volume trades.  Many of these OTC deals are governed by master agreements such as the ISDA Master Agreement and Credit Support Annex (CSA), which allow for highly tailored trades with flexible strike prices, expiration dates and collateral management terms.  Trading with regulated entities: a gateway for institutional investors  For institutional investors aiming to deploy bespoke options strategies and invest in yield-generating products, trading OTC options with a regulated entity is often the preferred route. Regulated counterparties provide a structured, transparent framework that minimizes counterparty risk and ensures compliance with legal and regulatory standards. Through this approach, institutions can execute large trades without the constraints typically found in the more public and less flexible centralized exchange environment.  Furthermore, the use of master agreements in OTC transactions offers significant advantages in terms of risk management and flexibility. These agreements enable institutions to customize the terms of their trades — such as the choice of strike prices, expiration dates, and collateral arrangements — while minimizing credit exposure through robust due diligence processes. As institutional demand for sophisticated options strategies continues to grow, regulated OTC counterparties will play an increasingly pivotal role, offering liquidity, security, and the capacity to manage large positions in an efficient and customized manner.

37217289,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51333,1733331607,XRP Price Trader Makes Accidental Altcoin Discovery That Will Shock Even Veterans,"The XRP price has been bullish, breaking key price barriers as it soared by over 430% in the past month. This price action reignites investor confidence and creates a ripple across the market, inspiring seasoned traders to seek the next big opportunity. While analyzing the meteoric rise of the XRP price, one trader stumbled upon a hidden gem: RCO Finance (RCOF). RCOF, currently priced at $0.07, shows the potential to mirror XRP’s historic bull run, with projections indicating it could soar to $2. This discovery has shocked even veterans and offers early-bird investors the chance for exponential gains before the market catches on. How XRP Price Analysis Led to an Unexpected Discovery While analyzing the bullish XRP price movement, the trader observed parallels between XRP’s market dynamics and this altcoin. Here’s what stood out. XRP’s surge has been fueled by regulatory clarity, growing adoption, and bullish market sentiment. The innovative features of the altcoin are laying the foundation for its meteoric rise. XRP’s early adopters benefited massively from its undervalued entry prices as the XRP price surged. Similarly, this altcoin, priced at just $0.07, offers the same opportunity for those who act early. Another contributor to the XRP price soaring close to $3 is the overall bullish sentiment in the market. Thanks to Bitcoin’s impressive performance, investors are willing to invest in other altcoins, benefiting XRP and this hidden gem greatly. This discovery highlights how this altcoin could replicate XRP’s bullish run, giving investors a lucrative chance to ride its growth wave as prices soar. RCO Finance: The Altcoin Set to Match The XRP Price Bull Run rising from $0.07 to $2 Just as this XRP trader discovered, RCO Finance isn’t just another emerging altcoin. It is an ecosystem designed to deliver practical utility and long-term value. RCOF is bridging the gap between crypto and traditional finance, providing access to real-world assets and expanding what users can do with their crypto assets. Projected to rise to $2 from $0.07, RCOF is poised to deliver extraordinary returns similar to XRP’s gains. RCO Finance is the industry’s first DeFi platform autonomously run by AI machine learning. This AI integration is a game changer, allowing RCOF to provide revolutionary trading tools to help users improve their investing, such as the robo-advisor. These tools provide real-time market analysis, personalized investment and trading guidance, automated portfolio management, predictive modeling and more. The robo-advisor is your trading assistant, providing institutional and hedge-fund-level support to improve decision-making and optimize investments. It analyzes market conditions and user data, such as financial goals and risk tolerance, to create personalized investment strategies. This personalization is groundbreaking as it ensures that all recommendations are geared toward helping you achieve your outlined goals. If you are fearless about taking on more risk and want quick gains, the robo-advisor can suggest high-growth, high-risk assets to invest in. However, if you prefer a more conservative approach, it can include more stable long-term investments. Its data-backed insights help users make smarter investment choices and ensure you don’t fall victim to emotional trading, letting fear or greed influence your decision-making. These emotional biases can lead to costly mistakes. RCOF has integrated real-world assets (RWAs), allowing users to purchase them directly using cryptocurrency. By tokenizing RWAs, RCOF is helping users bypass costly crypto-to-fiat conversions and democratizing access to these high-value assets. With this accessibility, users can easily level up their portfolios and spread their risk. Unlike XRP, whose price growth was greatly hindered by regulatory uncertainty, RCOF differentiates itself by ensuring compliance. Its SolidProof audit and partnership with Fireblocks to improve its security are some ways it prioritizes compliance. This helps build trust and credibility among investors. Cash in on This $0.07 to $2 Opportunity With RCOF The rising XRP price continues to bring incredible gains to XRP investors. RCOF presents a similar but more lucrative opportunity with its innovative AI-powered features and a prediction it could rise to $2 from $0.07. RCOF’s ROI is unmatched and primed to replicate or surpass XRP’s gains. Its presale is underway, presenting the perfect chance to supercharge your portfolio with this high-growth altcoin. With an anticipated listing price of between $0.4 and $0.6, RCOF is pretty close from its $2 target. Take advantage of this limited-time offer and your chance for explosive returns.

37216546,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622414,1733331234,Regulatory uncertainty to blame for dismal uptake of stablecoins in global e-commerce,"The worldwide usage of cryptocurrencies including stablecoins in online trades is wanting. That’s per a new IDA Finance and Quinlan Associates payments report. The study found that digital assets account for only 0.2% of the global e-commerce transaction value. According to the dispatch , most merchants quote asset volatility as their major fear in accepting transactions in crypto assets. Notwithstanding Fiat-referenced stablecoins’ design to counter that (volatility), risks and uncertainties on regulation, governance KYC, and AML requirements impede merchants from supporting their payments. An excerpt of the findings states: All of these risks stem from the absence of well-defined legal frameworks that outline the rules and responsibilities for both issues and users of stablecoins. This landscape of uncertainty leaves merchants hesitant to accept stablecoins as a mainstream payment option. IDA Finance and Quinlan Associates payments report Users, on their part, have decried the lack of transparency regarding reserve holdings of some unregulated stablecoins. To them, this lack of clarity breeds doubts about the assets’ safety and reliability. That uncertainty about what backs the coins deters their mainstream usage. Regulatory uncertainty exposes stablecoin users to risks The report further highlights the various risks to which this regulatory ambiguity exposes stablecoin users. The first is market risk due to the absence of legally set reserve ratio requirements. As such, the coins may lose their peg values when the assets backing them fluctuate, as with Terra’s collapse. Secondly, lack of licensing gives the issuers free reign over their ventures. With no one overseeing their management, there’s the danger of mismanagement leading to financial challenges. When that happens, users could lose their funds or be unable to redeem them at full fiat value. Finally, there’s liquidity risk. Stablecoin projects may struggle to fulfill sudden and voluminous redemption requests, as with NuBits. Insufficient reserves and flailing user trust saw one of the pioneering stablecoins crash in 2018. These risks stress the gravity of stablecoin transparency, an issue that robust regulations can help address. To date, the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets law remains the boldest move to rein in the sector. Other nations have followed suit providing guidelines for safe and open usage of the coins. Cash and fiat dominate transactions despite growing crypto adoption While crypto adoption is growing, cash remains the preferred mode of completing transactions. Even the outlets accepting stablecoins still contract external payment processors to convert the crypto assets to fiat. Therefore, their indirect acceptance of cryptos further limits stablecoin usage in real economies. It doesn’t help that those outlets usually restrict crypto usage to pay for low-value items. Their cautiousness highlights how far along we are from mainstreaming crypto payments.

However, the company clarified that it is not obligated to purchase any specific amount of stock and may adjust the program as needed. “The launch of the ATM Program and Stock Repurchase Program have equipped the business with two powerful tools that we believe bolster our ability to navigate the volatile markets in which we operate,” said Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot. “Our key investors continue to believe in us, and the flexibility provided by the ATM Program and Stock Repurchase Program strengthens our ability to pursue ambitious growth objectives with confidence while maintaining a relentless focus on driving sustainable shareholder returns,” stated Genoot.

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-pepe-solana-memecoin-to-rally-19000-ahead-of-first-exchange-listing-as-shib-and-dogecoin-drop/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Among the top coins, Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) stands out with its 50% gain in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, Hedera surged 166% in the past week, making its run one of the best since November. Investors invested $6.87 billion in November in the Spot Bitcoin ETF as the BTC price rose 39% to $99,000 for the first time. As markets continued to rise, BTC prices stayed under the $96,000 price range as traders consolidated their positions. Among the upcoming ICOs, DTX Exchange (DTX) is getting noticed due to its high utility offering and the market response to its pre-sales activities. The altcoin has raised $9.3 million in Stage 6, giving early investors a 100% return on their funds. Spot Bitcoin ETF Charge Ahead as BTC Price Stalls Before Take-off over $100K Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds rose by billions of dollars as high BTC prices supported the market bull run. Institutional and private investors poured billions of dollars into spot Bitcoin ETFs brought in the last week of November following an interest rate cut by the Fed. Source: CoinMarketCap Spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced straight inflows for several days as markets prepare for the upcoming rally. However, BTC’s price seems coy and has stopped shy of the landmark $100K price several times, raising fears of an extended wait time for investors. Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) Investors Delighted with 721% Growth Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) is a sustainable, enterprise-grade public network for the decentralized economy that permits individuals and businesses to create powerful decentralized applications (DApps) on its network. It is designed to be a fair and more efficient system that addresses some of the limitations that older blockchain-based platforms face, like slow performance and instability. Source: CoinMarketCap Hedera investors had a dream run with their altcoin, which rewarded them with a sustained 721% rally for the month. What is amazing is that the BTC price stumble in late November did not affect HBAR’s progress to the top. The seven-day charts show gains of 164%, while daily charts show a 45% gain. Multi-Utility DTX Exchange (DTX) Closes Pre-Sales with 80% Gains As the crypto markets continue to explode, investors are looking for coins that will earn high returns on their investments. Among the available options, DTX Exchange (DTX) is dominating the list of cryptos to add to any portfolio despite being in its presale stage. The DTX Exchange network is supported by a hybrid blockchain, VulcanX, which has a proprietary design for maintaining the DTX platform’s operation. It is also supported by the Phoenix Wallet, which enables direct transactions, eliminating the need to register for KYC and allowing the underbanked population to invest freely through the platform. The best part of using DTX Exchange is that some of the assets offered have up to 1000x leverage options linked, and there are nearly 120,000 asset classes. The possibility of success will increase as more users will enjoy access to better market positions. Conclusion Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) and BTC prices may continue to surprise the cryptocurrency market, but DTX Exchange is the clear pick in new launches. With its trailblazing trading capability of real-world assets, DTX Exchange is ready to launch into a trillion-dollar market.

In his recent comments on X, Sun emphasized Tron’s commitment to balancing its vision of decentralization with the evolving stance of the upcoming administration on cryptocurrency regulation. MicroStrategy’s success shows how innovation beats outdated regulations. Under Trump, U.S. crypto deregulation is finally shifting. What’s better than our own ""Micro"" Strategy for TRX? Stay tuned 🚀 — H.E. Justin Sun 🍌 (@justinsuntron) December 4, 2024 Sun noted that MicroStrategy, a business intelligence company that is well known for its Bitcoin buys, could be used as a model for Tron’s growth. He applauded MicroStrategy for leveraging Bitcoin to improve its financial health and shift its image. Comparing it to another project, Sun suggested that Tron may be using a “Micro” approach. This could mean using new measures of treasury management, enhancing the role of TRX in the financial systems, or even keeping a Crypto treasure chest similar to MicroStrategy’s BTC reserves. This could help in the acquisition of institutional investors and make TRX popular, thus increasing its value and market standing. Sun was optimistic about the prospect of the US regulatory environment loosening up a bit. According to him, a favorable environment will propel innovation within the cryptocurrency industry, thus leading to projects like Tron. MicroStrategy recently bought an additional 15,400 BTC in its reserves, an investment of about $1.5 billion. The details of the acquisition, which took place between Nov. 25 and Dec. 1, were revealed in an 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This comes after the company sold 3,728,507 shares in the same period, which was also worth $1.5 billion. In its $21 billion equity and fixed-income securities sale, MicroStrategy plans to generate $42 billion over the next three years to buy more bitcoins. This latest acquisition means that MicroStrategy now holds 402,100 BTC worth more than $38 billion. TRX hits it’s all-time high On Dec. 3, TRX, the native token of the Tron network, reached a new ATH at just above $0.44. This rally helped TRX to get a market capitalization of over $30 billion. The surge also pushed TRX to the 10th position on CoinMarketCap, overtaking Avalanche’s (AVAX) market cap. As of this writing, the token is currently trading at $0.35, registering a 45% increase in the last 24 hours. The surge happened at the same time Javon Marks, a social media influencer, had predicted a major rally. Marks noted that TRX may undergo a “logarithmic follow-through”, which could see the asset reach $1.11, which could mean a potential gain of 720%. Also, Mihir, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on X, painted a very bullish picture and put forward a target of $1.80 for TRX, which is 336% higher than the current price. TRX, the next XRP👀 — H.E.

The testnet, known as  Aragog, introduces tools that will form the basis for the mainnet's DeFi offering, such as bitcoin (BTC)-backed stablecoin Palladium, decentralized exchange Bitzy and lending and borrowing market Spindle.  Botanix Labs, which aims to introduce the mainnet in the first quarter, is building Spiderchain to be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the software that powers the Ethereum network. The goal is to allow any application or smart contract to be copied and pasted onto Bitcoin, creating provision for the kind of DeFi applications that would generally call Ethereum home.   In short, Botanix says its aim is to ""bring Bitcoin back online and onchain.""  ""Every member of the Bitcoin economy should work to ensure that demand for onchain applications endures so Bitcoin can fulfill its potential and transition from digital gold to a full global currency,"" Botanix said in a blog post on Wednesday.  There are several Bitcoin layer 2s seeking to bring over the kind of utility and programmability that is commonplace on networks like Ethereum.  The motivation for this is a mixture of wishing to harness the increased security and decentralization that the Bitcoin network offers, while wanting to access the wells of capital that are held in BTC, which are far deeper than any other cryptoasset.

Is WEPE Token the best new Pepe play in the market? Crypto degens’ favorite green friend is back, and his timing couldn’t be better amid this bullish market. But this time, WEPE isn’t just here to ride the wave – he’s got a score to settle with how this bull market is unfolding. Sure, $PEPE surged 128% in November, but whales have dominated most of those gains, leaving the smaller fish out in the cold. That’s where the WEPE Army steps in. The crypto market’s Jordan Belfort is assembling a squadron of $WEPE holders, armed with exclusive trading insights and alpha calls to level the playing field and allow all crypto investors to trade like Pepe – essentially, trade like a champ. To join the ranks and get in on the mad degen plays, all you need to do is hold the $ WEPE token. You can grab yours by participating in the Wall Street Pepe presale, where one WEPE Token is currently at its entry price of $0.000202 – possibly the lowest $WEPE could get. The WEPE Token presale price increases when the raised total reaches $660,861, so there’s no time to lose to buy. But don’t wait too long – this price won’t last as the presale progresses through multiple stages, with each round seeing a price increase. The next increase is due in less than three days. As meme coin values soar, Wall Street Pepe offers retail investors a chance to catch the next big wave The meme coin supercycle has already pushed the total value of tokens in the sector past the $116 billion mark. Millionaires are being made every week. Dogecoin ($DOGE) and Shiba Inu ($SHIB), the two leading meme coins that outpaced even Bitcoin ($BTC) and Solana ($SOL) in gains last month, continue to deliver solid returns. Over the past seven days, $DOGE has gained 6.92%, while $SHIB has surged by 24.03%. However, the only non-Doge or Shiba Inu-themed token in the top six meme coins, $PEPE, is quickly catching up. After breaking its all-time high in November, the third most valuable meme coin is now valued at $0.00002087. Those who have held $PEPE with conviction are likely celebrating its new peak, but none may be happier than those who bought the shining green symbol of degeneracy at its lowest listing price. Imagine those who bought $PEPE at that price seeing a $1,000 investment skyrocket to a staggering $1.8 million. For those who didn’t pull the trigger, it’s safe to say they might still be losing sleep over it. Pepe Price: PEPE Live Price Chart, Market Cap & News Today | CoinGecko Unfortunately, many of those who missed the train did so simply because they lacked access to the right information – missing out on opportunities that could have added multiple zeroes to their net worth. Enter the new and improved Pepe, Wall Street Pepe , equipped with professional-grade insights and exclusive knowledge, now available to retail investors through the WEPE trading group. Wall Street Pepe promises to be the ally non-whales need to generate a whale-like impact in the crypto market. Wall Street Pepe’s equalizer: the WEPE trading community with its premium suite of tools The WEPE trading community are $WEPE token holders who have experienced the highs and lows of being rich and being poor – and now they are choosing rich every single time. Tired of the whale-dominated crypto space, their frog friend WEPE is flipping the script, giving the little guys the same premium tools that only the big players once had access to. Holding $WEPE token delivers the trading alpha that beats the market. With exclusive trading insights, signals, strategies, and alpha calls, Wall Street Pepe is democratizing the market just like the ultimate short squeeze on Wall Street. WEPE Token’s rapidly growing community has its own private insider group , where the real action unfolds. Holders discuss strategies, share alpha, and stay up-to-date on WEPE’s latest plays to beat the whales at their own game. But Wall Street Pepe doesn’t stop at disrupting market manipulation – it takes things further. WEPE sweetens the deal with trading rewards , allowing $WEPE holders to submit their best trade ideas and earn $WEPE token prizes. Staking rewards are equally enticing. Dynamic APY rates, currently offering 1,506%, reward early adopters and loyal stakers, giving them returns like the type of yield a savvy trader would expect from a blue-chip stock portfolio. Trade like Pepe – Now’s your chance to jump in on the next 1,873x Pepe token with $WEPE Token As mentioned, over $400,000 was raised from early investors in just the past day, signaling a massive opportunity for Wall Street Pepe backers. For those who missed the 1,873x return on $PEPE, this could be their shot at redemption. There’s no time to waste – $WEPE is still priced at a significant discount, positioning early investors to become major holders once the token lists on exchanges. Head to the official Wall Street Pepe website , connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ), and purchase $WEPE with ETH or USDT.

In an announcement on Dec. 4, Nuvei revealed it would be partnering with several companies to bring this solution to the region. The partners include Rain, a Coinbase Ventures and Circle Ventures-backed vertically integrated issuing partner, BitGo, a crypto custody and wallet provider, and global payments giant Visa. Nuvei leverages the various solutions available via these platforms to make it easy for businesses to use stablecoins as a payment option. The supported stablecoins include USDC ( USDC ). Via its collaboration, the Canada-based firm allows merchants across the Latin America region to benefit from blockchain payments. LATAM merchants can utilize Visa-supported physical or virtual cards for payments with stablecoins across the globe. “By integrating stablecoin technology into our payment platform for B2B settlement we’re ensuring our merchants continually receive unparalleled flexibility, security, and global reach,” Nuvei Chair and chief executive officer Philip Fayer, said in a statement.

As the adoption of stablecoin payments and settlements grows, various providers and industry players have looked to innovative ways to bring traditional financial rails on board. LATAM is one of the regions seeing this increased traction, with top stablecoin issuers Tether and Circle leading support programs. Both companies have key partnerships in the region, with Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil being key destinations. In June 2024, blockchain firm Kaiko released a report that showed USDT is considerably more popular in LATAM than Bitcoin, the flagship digital asset that has recently seen its value rise to near $100,000.

37215271,https://crypto.news/?p=14315902,1733329056,62% of Solana’s DEX transactions belong to Pump.fun — What keeps it going?,"What makes Pump.fun dominate Solana’s DEX market, even as scandals rock its ecosystem and raise questions about its sustainability? Table of Contents Pump.fun’s revenue takes a dip The coins leading the Pump.fun wave The dark underbelly of Pump.fun Staying safe on Pump.fun Pump.fun’s revenue takes a dip The crypto world is no stranger to wild trends, but every so often, something truly captivating comes along to reshape the narrative. Enter Pump.fun — a platform built on the Solana ( SOL ) blockchain that makes creating and trading meme coins as effortless as snapping your fingers. In November alone, Pump.fun hit its stride, recording its highest-ever monthly revenue at a staggering $93.88 million. This marked a jaw-dropping leap from $30.5 million in October and $14.5 million in September, reflecting over 200% month-on-month growth from October and an incredible 548% surge compared to September. Pump.fun’s monthly revenue chart | Source: DeFi LIama Yet, as Pump.fun soared to financial heights, cracks in its ecosystem began to surface. By late November, revenues showed early signs of strain. Weekly revenue, which had peaked at $33.83 million for the week ending Nov. 17, slid to $25.44 million by Nov. 27. Then came the crash: by the week ending Dec. 1, revenue had plummeted to just $6.05 million. Pump.fun’s weekly revenue | Source: DeFi LIama The decline wasn’t caused by typical market fluctuations but rather by a scandal that shook the platform to its core — a livestream feature introduced to boost user engagement. Reports quickly emerged of users exploiting the feature to broadcast disturbing and explicit content, including violence and horrifying material involving minors and animals. The uproar forced Pump.fun to remove the livestream feature amid widespread condemnation from the crypto community. Surprisingly, the controversy hasn’t quelled enthusiasm for Pump.fun’s meme coin ecosystem. As of Dec. 3, the combined market cap of these coins has exceeded $6.5 billion — placing them ahead of more than 70% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies. Let’s explore the coins riding this wave, the controversies it has faced, and what the road ahead might hold for Pump.fun, Solana, and the crypto world at large. You might also like: 12-year-olds, shotguns, and threats: Pump.fun’s livestream misuse leaves the community stunned The coins leading the Pump.fun wave Pump.fun has become a fertile ground for meme coins that are not just quirky but also astonishingly profitable — at least for now. The platform’s meme coins have taken the decentralized exchange activity on Solana by storm, accounting for an impressive 62.3% of all DEX transactions in November, according to Dune Analytics. This figure has been steadily climbing, up from 60% in October and 57% in August. As of Dec. 3, the total trading volume for Pump.fun-linked coins surpassed $5.5 billion in the past 24 hours, with several tokens recording gains of over 100%. Over the last 30 days, some coins have delivered jaw-dropping returns of 30x to 35x, driven by social media buzz and a bullish market sentiment. Leading the charge in Pump.fun’s meme coin success is Act I: The AI Prophecy ( ACT ). This token has posted astronomical returns of 3,750% over the past month, now trading at $0.51 with a market cap nearing $500 million. ACT’s allure lies in its mysterious premise and cryptic tagline: “Exploring emergent behavior from multi-AI, multi-human interaction.” Little else is known about the project, but its air of intrigue, coupled with speculative hype, has captivated traders. Another standout is Peanut ( PNUT ), a meme coin that has soared by over 1,300% in the last 30 days, trading at $1.20 with a market cap exceeding $1.2 billion. PNUT was launched as a tribute to Peanut the Squirrel, a beloved internet mascot with a devoted fanbase. After Peanut’s untimely death, the coin tapped into waves of public nostalgia and sympathy, turning collective grief into a speculative goldmine. Meanwhile, Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) has arguably been the most viral token in Pump.fun’s ecosystem. Since hitting an all-time low of $0.006, CHILLGUY has skyrocketed by over 8,300%, currently trading at $0.4936. Although it peaked at $0.65, the token has since retraced by about 22%. The success of these tokens isn’t just reshaping the meme coin narrative—it’s also deeply influencing the Solana ecosystem. Critics argue that such reliance on a speculative, meme-driven economy could be risky. “An economy built on this will not make it,” wrote Millie, Project Lead at Ethereum ( ETH ) news protocol TrueMarkets, on Twitter. You can call it edgy or unhinged comedy, but this is why we all know deep down that the solano community is not serious. An economy built on this will not make it. It doesn’t matter how hard all the solano brands lean into it, this is a house of cards which only ends one way. pic.twitter.com/XGgPWldkQT — MilliΞ (@llamaonthebrink) November 22, 2024 The fear is that Solana’s broader adoption could be undermined if its growth hinges on Pump.fun’s meme coins, which, while lucrative now, remain highly speculative and prone to rapid declines. The dark underbelly of Pump.fun Beneath the glittering gains and soaring hype of Pump.fun lies a shadowy underbelly shaped by manipulation, bots, and questionable tactics that cast a long shadow over its ecosystem. Social media threads and forums are rife with accounts detailing how traders, developers, and automated systems exploit the platform’s structure to create artificial hype, inflate volumes, and engineer unsustainable gains. One of the most commonly discussed tactics involves volume manipulation. Pump.fun’s algorithm prioritizes tokens with high trading activity, propelling them to the platform’s front page. This visibility mechanism is routinely exploited through “bump trades,” where coordinated groups of individuals or bots execute micro-transactions — sometimes for as little as $1 — solely to boost a token’s perceived popularity. According to one user, even a modestly organized group can manipulate a token’s visibility and rake in short-term gains of 100% to 200%, often cashing out before the wider community catches on. Bots have become the weapon of choice in this ecosystem. Many users openly share strategies for programming or acquiring volume bots that can automate hundreds of transactions per second. These bots mimic organic market activity, making it nearly impossible for casual investors to distinguish legitimate projects from orchestrated pump-and-dump schemes. Beyond volume manipulation, more advanced bots offer features like wallet generation, token sniping, and liquidity pooling, allowing developers and traders to exploit Pump.fun’s mechanics with ruthless efficiency. A particularly damning practice, detailed in forum discussions, involves developers using bots to buy up their own tokens, inflate prices, and then offload their holdings onto unsuspecting traders. This tactic, known as “rug pulling,” leaves latecomers bearing the brunt of the losses while developers walk away with massive profits. The consequences of these practices ripple far beyond individual tokens. Conversations across forums suggest that less than 1% of the tokens created on Pump.fun ever make it to established exchanges like Raydium. The platform’s bonding curve mechanism guarantees liquidity once a token reaches a $63,000 market cap, enabling its launch on Raydium ( RAY ). However, even for the few tokens that achieve this milestone, many suffer rapid price collapses as bots and early investors cash out, leaving latecomers with heavy losses. Critics have dubbed Pump.fun a “scammer’s paradise,” where developers and insiders profit at the expense of uninformed participants lured by the platform’s simplicity and hype. Compounding the issue is Pump.fun’s low barrier to entry, which has resulted in an oversaturated market. Inexperienced developers flood the platform with tokens, often lacking any clear purpose or roadmap, relying instead on aggressive shilling and manipulated metrics to attract buyers. As one user mentioned , “The demand for meme coins to gamble on used to be higher than the actual meme coins being created. Now it’s the opposite, and there aren’t enough buyers to support all this activity.” This oversupply has fueled a cycle of rug pulls, where developers abandon projects and pocket investor funds, further eroding trust in the ecosystem. One user recounted losing their entire savings across multiple tokens, blaming rampant manipulation and the platform’s lack of safeguards. Another noted the psychological toll of the space, describing how Pump.fun preys on the inexperienced and those chasing quick riches, creating a fertile ground for exploitation. Despite these risks, Pump.fun remains wildly popular, particularly among younger traders who embrace its fast-paced and anarchic nature. Some argue that the platform reflects the ethos of DeFi — a space where individual responsibility reigns supreme. Yet this freedom comes at a cost. The widespread manipulation and scams not only harm individual participants but also risk tarnishing the broader perception of Solana as a blockchain. Staying safe on Pump.fun “Even the best degens can lose their deposit,” warns Hades Web3, a web3 expert shedding light on the risky undercurrents of platforms like Pump.fun. https://twitter.com/0xHvdes/status/1849940008570060903 The first rule of staying safe is to approach every token with skepticism, regardless of how promising it may seem. As Hades points out, “Everything starts with creating a new wallet and depositing it from CEX or a crypto-mixer to make it look disconnected from the creator.” Scam tokens often go to great lengths to appear legitimate, setting up clean wallet histories and leveraging bots to create the illusion of activity. To counter this, tools like RugCheck and BubbleMaps can be used to analyze wallet interactions and detect signs of manipulation. However, remember that even advanced tools aren’t infallible — always combine them with your own observations. Community analysis is another crucial step. Hades stressed the importance of looking at a token’s comments section across platforms like Pump.fun, DexScreener, and Twitter. Genuine community feedback tends to be diverse and conversational, while bot-generated comments are often overly formal and repetitive. Searching for the token’s contract address on Twitter can also provide valuable insights, as experienced traders often share red flags or anomalies that may not be immediately visible. One of the biggest traps is blind trust in influencers or Key Opinion Leaders. While they may lend credibility to a token, Hades advises against relying on their endorsements alone. Instead of focusing on promotional posts, look for organic discussions among retail traders and “degens” who are more likely to share authentic opinions. KOLs are often paid in tokens for promotion, meaning their interests may not align with yours. Hades cautions, “Don’t consider KOLs as a good sign; look for degens.” Timing is equally critical in avoiding losses. Tokens that have already experienced strong gains may seem tempting, but they are often at high risk of sudden collapses. As Hades warns, “Your Twitter ‘Explore’ page is overfilled with KOLs shilling the token that’s already pumped up by 200%. But in a couple of seconds, it’ll instantly go to zero.” Avoid jumping into tokens that have already seen exponential growth, as the likelihood of a rug pull increases with each passing wave of new buyers. For those new to platforms like Pump.fun, starting small is a wise approach. Allocating only what you can afford to lose ensures that even in the worst-case scenario, your overall financial health remains intact. Diversification is another key strategy — spreading your investments across multiple tokens and platforms reduces the risk of being wiped out by a single scam or market downturn. Finally, be wary of too-good-to-be-true claims. Projects offering guaranteed returns or promising revolutionary use cases without clear roadmaps should be met with caution. Transparency is a hallmark of trustworthy projects, so take the time to review whitepapers, team information, and tokenomics before committing your funds. As Pump.fun and similar platforms continue to evolve, their impact on the crypto space will likely grow. While they democratize access to token creation and trading, they also amplify risks for those who dive in unprepared. By arming yourself with the right tools, cultivating a healthy sense of skepticism, and making informed decisions, you can participate in the meme coin trend without falling victim to its darker side. After all, in a market driven by speculation and chaos, your best defence is knowledge and caution. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

However, whales seem unfazed as they keep buying portions of the asset while analyst envision a massive rally that could push it to as high as $600. SOL Whales Push the Buy Button As mentioned above, Solana’s native token was among the biggest beneficiaries of Trump’s victory as it found a place among the top four altcoins at one point when it was in front of XRP and surpassed BNB. However, the roles have reversed, with XRP surging to the third spot, while Binance Coin took back the fifth earlier today after a historic rally to a fresh peak. Solana, alongside other assets like BTC and DOGE, has remained on the sidelines for the past few weeks. SOL has been consolidating and trading about 10-12% away from its November 23 peak. It seems large Solana investors have used this correction as an opportunity to increase their stash. Data from Lookonchain showcased several whale wallets that have withdrawn sizeable portions of the asset out of Binance and to cold storage – moves traditionally regarded as bullish for the underlying cryptocurrency as they reduce the immediate sell pressure.

BinanceUS will activate trading facilities for Pepe ( PEPE ), crypto’s third-largest meme coin token by market cap. The token is available on Binance’s global exchange, but its American subsidiary refrained from listing several digital assets due to regulatory uncertainty and litigation. However, policy constraints and crypto crackdowns declined after Republican Donald Trump won the Nov. 6 presidential elections.

The rise in the value of digital assets echoes the broad altcoin market’s bullish sentiment, and analysts expect they will all surge even further in the long term. According to Coingecko data , Binance’s native token, BNB, has surged by approximately 20% in the past 24 hours. The rally pushed its market cap past Solana’s SOL, moving its previous position to become the fifth-largest crypto by market cap. Exchange tokens GT and BGB have also experienced price surges that have led to all-time high values. Source: X On the other hand, the current global crypto market cap stands at $3.74 trillion, reflecting a 2.78% change over the last 24 hours. Bitcoin’s current market cap is $1.9 trillion, reflecting a 50.72% dominance of Bitcoin. The Stablecoins market cap stands at $199 billion, representing a 5.31% share of the overall crypto market cap. BNB hits $771.60 ATH before slight retreat Binance’s native token, BNB, hit an all-time high of $771.60 earlier today, catapulting the project’s market capitalization beyond $110 billion. The asset has experienced a steady rise over the last couple of weeks, gaining 15.8% in the past 24 hours, 22.6% over the last week, and 34.4% in the past month. Compared to its values in December 2023, BNB has surged by nearly 230%. However, after touching its peak, the token saw a modest dip of 2.1%, trading just below its record high. Analysts at CoinCodex predict further upside price movement for BNB, expecting it to breach the $800 mark by mid-December, with a potential high of $839.19 projected for December 16. Achieving this would require an uptick of approximately 11.14% from current levels. GT Soars Beyond Previous Highs Gate.io’s native token, GT, has also captured market attention with a robust uptrend, reaching a peak of $13.63, slightly surpassing its previous all-time high. This rally marks the completion of an impulsive five-wave Elliott Wave pattern, signaling the culmination of a prolonged accumulation phase since December 2023. Technical indicators, however, hint at possible resistance ahead. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has entered the overbought territory, reaching 80, suggesting a cooling-off phase may be imminent. Source: TradingView Gate.io recently introduced a crypto card designed for users in the European Economic Area (EEA) to experience seamless crypto-to-fiat transactions. The debit card, which is reportedly backed by Visa, allows holders to pay at any merchant that accepts traditional bank cards, integrating cryptocurrencies effortlessly into everyday spending. BGB to launches BitEXC Platform in Vietnam, hits new highs Bitget’s native token, BGB, reached a new all-time high of $1.74, reflecting a 232.39% increase over the past year. The token achieved successive highs within a fortnight, hitting $1.69 towards the end of November. At press time, BGB is trading at $1.72 and could be on the brink of surpassing its ATH level. The crypto market’s current bullish momentum has bolstered BGB’s recent breakout from a falling wedge pattern, a classic bullish reversal signal. Technical indicators reinforce the potential for further price gains: the MACD has formed a bullish crossover, signaling upward momentum, while the RSI sits at a healthy 58, indicating moderate buying pressure without nearing overbought levels. Bitget token’s key support lies at $1.50 and $1.30, while resistance is set at $1.75 and $2.00. This breakout positions BGB for continued growth, with analysts forecasting sustained upward trends through the end of 2024. The token’s price surge comes after the exchange announced BitEXC’s launch. BitEXC is a trading platform launched in Vietnam. Bitget is looking to tap into Vietnam’s fast-growing crypto community. The country ranks second globally in cryptocurrency ownership, with 21.2% of its population involved in digital assets. In addition to peer-to-peer (P2P) trading, BitEXC provides both spot and futures trading options. The platform supports payments via ViettelPay, a state-operated service; Momo, a Vietnamese payment system backed by Canada’s Nuvei; and ZaloPay, which integrates with the local Zalo messaging app. On its launch day, only P2P trading was operational.

While some financial assets faltered under the weight of political uncertainty, XRP has not only recovered its losses but has maintained an upward trajectory. Yesterday, XRP dipped to $2.36 shortly after reaching a new seven-year peak of $2.86, representing a 17% intraday drop.The dip followed South Korea’s brief martial law order. Meanwhile, XRP’s price later rebounded to near $2.70.South Korea's Role in XRP's MomentumThe declaration of martial law by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Tuesday sent shockwaves through financial markets. For instance, the development initially pushed South Korea's won to multi-year lows, triggering financial instability.This effect also spilled over into the crypto market, particularly affecting XRP. South Korea is one of the largest crypto markets globally and plays a critical role in XRP’s trading activity.Analyst Dom pointed out that Upbit, the country’s leading crypto exchange, recently matched or even exceeded Binance in XRP trading volumes. This outcome underscores the substantial influence of South Korean traders on XRP. Chart showing XRP volume on Upbit and Binance Despite the initial selloff in XRP due to the market panic, the token quickly regained its footing, climbing back to near pre-announcement levels.

Tuesday’s statement of Curve’s stablecoin scrvUSD launch on Spectra triggered the ongoing bullish wave. Curve Finance @CurveFinance · Follow Yield markets are very very important, and for Savings crvUSD @spectra_finance is one of the first to go up news.curve.fi/spectra-financ… 4:45 PM · Dec 3, 2024 198 Reply Copy link Read 7 replies Curve DAO is a DEX for stablecoin that utilizes an AMM (automated market maker) to control liquidity. Meanwhile, its newly launched Savings-crvUSD yield-bearing stablecoin went live on the Spectra network yesterday. Savings-crvUSD provides low-risk investor returns and aids in crvUSD scaling, drawing more participants to the Curve platforms. The recent announcement indicated: Spectra uses Curve’s Cryptoswap AMM algorithm, where CurveDAO earns 50% of all fees generated by liquidity pools on Spectra. Spectra is an example of Curve’s AMMs being utilized in the yield-trading ecosystem, a part of DeFi popularized by Pendle. Launched on 3 December, stablecoin scrUSD has gained notable popularity, attracting deposits worth over $14.5 million. The new product underscores Curve Finance’s dedication to enhancing the adoption and scalability of the crvUSD stablecoin. By integrating scrvUSD into the Spectra network, the DEX targets increased decentralized finance (DeFi) products and more users to join the CRV blockchain. CRV price performance The token trades at $1.19 after gaining over 40% the previous day. It touched the $0.8512 daily low and a $1.21 24-hour peak. Source: Coinmarketcap The robust daily trading volume, up 35% within the past day, suggests a healthy environment for continued upswings. Besides the stablecoin developments, on-chain stats support the altcoin’s upward stance. CRV’s staking has skyrocketed from 27 November’s $445.3 million to $839.3 million on 4 December – hitting the highest mark since June 2022. The surging staking confirms more players actively engaging with the Curve blockchain, highlighting increased adoption. Moreover, the CRV chain experiences an uptick in liquidity and trader interest. According to Artemis data, Curve’s 24-hour trading volume exploded to $1.6 billion yesterday, exploring values never seen since the asset’s 2020 launch. CRV eyes another 33% increase The latest upsurge saw CRV breaking above the plunging trendline formed by connecting several weekly peaks from July 2022. The bullish move intensified early this week, catalyzing a more than 145% gain till today. CRV reclaimed the 50% FIB retracement mark of $0.88, and bulls target a retest of the July 2022 peak at $1.58. Attaining this goal would mean a 32.77% price increase from current values. Nonetheless, caution remains paramount as the Relative Strength Index at 83.43 (on the 4H chart) confirms overbought situations. That positions CRV for potential dips before anticipated highs. Meanwhile, the underway altcoin season indicates that any dips might be short-lived. The alt season index has hit levels never seen since 2022, suggesting continued outperformance in the altcoin sector.

With a market capitalization of $146.56 billion, the token priced at $2.56 at the time of publication has solidified itself as the third-largest cryptocurrency . This rally has been supported by several key factors, including rumors surrounding Ripple’s expanding ecosystem, growing optimism over regulatory clarity, and a broader bullish trend in the crypto market. XRP’s 318% gain over the last year outperformed 81% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Meanwhile, technical indicators remain strong, with the token trading above its 200-day simple moving average and recording 20 green days in the past 30 days. However, with XRP now in overbought territory, there is room for caution that a short-term pullback may be on the horizon. XRP overbought and SMA technical analysis chart.

The psychological resistance at $3.00 remains a major hurdle, with $2.94 offering an immediate test of strength. A decisive breakout above these levels could pave the way for XRP to challenge its ATH of $3.55, last seen during the 2017 bull run. Conversely, a failure to hold $2.23 as support could trigger a short-term correction, potentially dragging the token below $2. Catalysts driving XRP’s rise The current rally appears fueled by a mix of strong fundamentals and speculative optimism. Ripple’s recent launch of its RLUSD stablecoin is a pivotal development, designed to enhance liquidity and solidify the company’s ecosystem. While some critics argue that RLUSD could detract from XRP’s utility, proponents see the stablecoin as a complementary tool that strengthens Ripple’s infrastructure. The stablecoin launch may also boost confidence among institutional investors, creating a more reliable network for cross-border transactions. Adding to the bullish sentiment is speculation over a potential XRP spot ETF, with asset manager WisdomTree recently filing an application for such a product. A successful approval could unlock significant institutional capital and elevate XRP’s market position further. Meanwhile, former CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo’s prediction that the SEC may drop its case against Ripple has stoked regulatory optimism. Should this materialize, it would mark a seismic shift in the U.S. regulatory landscape for crypto, further legitimizing XRP. While speculation about Ripple’s ties to regulatory bodies and the Federal Reserve remains unconfirmed, it highlights the growing perception of XRP as a utility-driven asset. With its RLUSD stablecoin launch and potential ETF approval, XRP is carving out a stronger role in institutional and cross-border payment markets.

To read full editions, subscribe . If crypto were an ocean, Terra was a whirlpool the size of a Maelstrom. And by all accounts, when that Maelstrom collapsed in on itself, in May 2022, the chaos sucked the liquidity right out of crypto markets for a solid year. Stablecoins were crypto’s primary liquidity machine at the time and massive chunks of the market simply pulled the plug. Tether withstood a month-long $16 billion “bank run” on USDT, while Circle net burned over $30 billion USDC between June 2022 and November 2023. At the same time, Paxos was winding down Binance stablecoin BUSD — redeeming about $20 billion worth of stablecoins over a 12 month period. A period that coincidentally ended just as bitcoin’s current run was heating up in late 2023. Looking back, it’s clear that liquid staking and restaking tokens may have helped plug the leak as the rolling liquidations , bankruptcies , and fraud cases played out. This chart plots the market cap of stablecoins (blue) alongside liquid staking (purple) and restaking (pink) tokens since Q1 2021. Combining the three token classes forms what I’ve called crypto’s liquidity engine. Notice that as tens of billions of dollars were being drained from crypto via stablecoin redemptions — starting with Terra and into the middle of the chart — liquid staking tokens expanded to mitigate those losses. It kept crypto’s liquidity engine on an even keel for a solid 10 months, with liquid (re)staking tokens taking off at the first hint of a reversal of the stablecoin redemption trend. Terra is now a blip in crypto market history. Stablecoin supplies have just set a new all-time high close to $194 billion (about $6 billion higher than just before Terra), while liquid staking and restaking tokens are also at a fresh combined peak of $92.5 billion. That makes crypto’s liquidity engine nearly $300 billion deep — with apparently no Maelstrom in sight. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

The firm anticipates: Improved Legislation: Policies that foster innovation while protecting investors. Spot ETF Approvals: Regulatory green lights for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs could drive significant inflows into the market.

What This Means for Investors Opportunities Long-Term Growth: The extended bull market offers opportunities for sustained portfolio growth. Increased Adoption: Expanding use cases for crypto assets could drive demand. Diverse Investments: A wide range of tokens, from DeFi to gaming to infrastructure, are likely to perform well. Risks Regulatory Delays: Uncertainty in crypto laws could dampen momentum. Market Volatility: While bullish, crypto markets remain highly volatile. Community Reactions to Grayscale’s Predictions Optimism Among Analysts Market analysts echo Grayscale’s bullish sentiment, citing positive trends in market adoption and regulatory progress. “Grayscale’s predictions are spot on. 2025 is shaping up to be a landmark year for crypto.” “Improved infrastructure and ETFs will drive unprecedented institutional inflows.” Cautious Voices Some experts urge caution, warning that unforeseen global events or regulatory setbacks could impact growth. “The market looks strong, but investors should brace for volatility.” “It’s crucial to monitor legislative developments closely.” How Grayscale Is Positioning Itself As a leader in cryptocurrency asset management, Grayscale is actively expanding its offerings: Launching new investment trusts tied to emerging cryptocurrencies. Advocating for spot ETF approvals to make crypto more accessible to retail investors. Partnering with regulators to shape a balanced approach to cryptocurrency laws. Conclusion: A Promising Outlook for 2025 Grayscale’s forecast that the crypto bull market will extend into 2025 reflects growing confidence in the industry’s long-term potential. With evolving market structures, increased investor access, and anticipated regulatory clarity, the stage is set for continued growth. While risks remain, the opportunities for innovation and adoption are vast.

37214849,https://finbold.com/?p=216896,1733328192,"Is $4,000 next for Ethereum? Expert analysis","Ethereum ( ETH ) is the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization in the world — although the distance between it and Bitcoin ( BTC ) is vast in absolute terms. Similarly, the performance of the two leading digital assets has differed substantially throughout 2024. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $96,044,00 — with year-to-date (YTD) gains standing at 127.15%. In contrast, Ethereum’s returns thus far have been twice as small, at 62.01% on a YTD basis. However, on December 4, ETH surpassed a critical threshold — reclaiming and shooting past its monthly open, with prices reaching levels slightly above the $3,800 mark for the first time since July. ETH price YTD chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Unlike Bitcoin, which had an extended period of sideways price action (at least by the standards of a cryptocurrency), ETH has seen significant volatility over the course of the year. As its larger competitor has stalled on its way to a $100,000 price point , alt season has taken off — but the long-awaited Ethereum surge was slow to materialize, with many investors worried about potential pullbacks Now that this critical level of resistance has been breached, the ongoing altcoin rally is likely going to see renewed and bolstered momentum — but the biggest question of all is how ETH, as the cryptocurrency best positioned to benefit from a shift away from BTC, will perform going forward. Technical analysis suggests that the ETH rally has just started Ethereum breached the $3,800 mark on strong volume, which has risen by 8.62% over the last 24 hours as of press time, lending credence to the stance that this is not a false breakout. In late November, Finbold covered the work of two expert technical analysts — Alan Santana and Rekt Capital . Santana pointed out that weekly volume was at levels not seen since November of 2022, suggesting that, based on previous market cycles, price targets at $4,011, $5,800, $7,322, and ultimately $7,871 were warranted. Rekt Capital , on the other hand, highlighted that the asset was printing a bullish flag chart pattern, which suggested that a previous resistance at $3,700 would be retested. In a similar vein, trading expert CryptoBullet shared a long-term price chart that suggested that ETH is currently in the breakout phase of a long-term cup and handle pattern in an X post on December 2.

37214789,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=106810,1733328049,"Dogecoin Price Continues to Surge, While PropiChain Prepares for a 50,000% Breakout","The Dogecoin price has been gearing up for a major bull run since it jumped to the $0.4 threshold and began testing this resistance. As the Dogecoin price rallies, resulting from renewed attention from Elon Musk and the recently concluded US elections, investors’ attention is shifting to an emerging altcoin, PropiChain. PropiChain combines cutting-edge technology with real utility, allowing early investors to achieve a staggering 50,000% ROI. Could this altcoin be the next big opportunity in the crypto landscape that will surpass the Dogecoin price? Dogecoin Price Picking Up New Momentum The Dogecoin price has increased 5.4% in the last 24 hours, jumping to $0.4285 at press time. Dogecoin, a popular memecoin, is poised to continue upward after consolidating for two weeks. Amid ongoing consolidation in the Dogecoin price, technical analysis of the token suggests that the daily chart has formed a bullish ascending triangle, signaling that it’s about to break out. Based on DOGE’s historical momentums, if the Dogecoin price closes the daily candle above the $0.45 level, the token could jump by more than 30% in the coming days. A noted increase in trading volume indicates increased participation from traders and investors amidst the bullish outlook, contributing to a rise in the Dogecoin price. PropiChain: Redefining Blockchain Technology in a trillion Dollar Real Estate Market While the Dogecoin price gains thrive in speculation, PropiChain sets a new standard in blockchain innovation that will transform the real estate industry. One outstanding aspect of this altcoin is its blockchain-based real estate tokenization. This technology digitizes real estate, allowing fractional ownership. Investors will then be able to purchase property shares rather than the entire property. Similarly, it will open the global real estate market to diverse investors, contributing to liquidity. To improve user experience, this altcoin offers investors access to AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistance that provide guidance and support around the clock. By offering personalized recommendations, it guarantees that investors have access to essential information regarding property investment in real-time. PropiChain’s integration of the Metaverse will transform the lucrative real estate industry. It’s a revolution changing how investors access potential investment properties. Similarly, investors can tour properties virtually using 3D immersive technology from anywhere. Imagine walking through office spaces or rental properties on another continent from your home. The Metaverse removes geographical barriers by offering global access to the trillion-dollar real estate industry. Consequently, buyers and sellers connect seamlessly regardless of their physical location. BlockAudit thoroughly audited PropiChain and reported regulatory compliance and zero vulnerabilities. Investors can comfortably invest in the altcoin as it has adequate security measures and is safe from malicious attacks. Similarly, the recent listing of PropiChain on CoinMarketCap contributes to a significant milestone on its roadmap. This listing is a boost indicating more positive developments. The best is yet to come. Again, with a prediction for the altcoin potential of 50,000% ROI, the target price for PropiChain will be $2 after listing. With the altcoin’s mainstream popularity and real-world utility, the price could surge to even greater value than the $2 mark. Similarly, this will outpace the Dogecoin price surge by a great margin. PropiChain Presale: Limited Opportunity for a 50,000% ROI PropiChain stands out as an altcoin with revolutionary force in the crypto space as the Dogecoin price captures headlines with speculative rallies. Even as analysts predict that the Dogecoin price will rise even higher, PropiChain’s unique features and impressive ROI potential set it apart, making it a top choice for investors seeking an altcoin with real utility. The PropiChain presale starts at $0.004 and is quickly selling out due to growing interest from savvy investors. This marks the lowest price the token will ever be, hence a great opportunity for early investors to take advantage of the presale. Now is your chance to be part of an altcoin that will redefine the crypto market. Join the PropiChain presale today.

This provides a bullish outlook for Ethereum, as it enjoyed a parabolic rally the last time this happened. Ethereum Price To Confirm Golden Cross, What Next? In an X post, crypto analyst Tony Severino mentioned that the Ethereum price is heading to a golden cross this week. This golden cross occurs when a short-term moving average (MA), like the 50-day MA, crosses a long-term MA, like the 200-day MA. This typically indicates that the crypto in question is set to enjoy a long-term upward trend. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price At $1.3-$1.5 Is Still Possible, Here’s Why Crypto analyst Charting Guy also confirmed this development for the Ethereum price and provided insights into what happened the last time Ethereum witnessed this golden cross. In an X post, the crypto analyst shared a chart that showed what happened combined with the fractal from that time. Coincidentally, the last time the Ethereum price confirmed this golden cross on the daily timeframe was between November and December last year. Following the Golden Cross, Ethereum rallied from around $1,800 last year to a local top of around $3,600 in March earlier this year. If history were to repeat itself, the Ethereum price could again witness such a sustained upward trend into the new year. Charting Guy’s accompanying chart showed that Ethereum could rally to as high as $8,000 sometime between March and May next year. Ethereum is already showing signs of an upward momentum, having rallied these last few days while Bitcoin consolidates. The Ethereum price has already reclaimed the local top of $3,600 from earlier in the year. Meanwhile, Blockchain Center data shows that it is already altcoin season. This is when Ethereum and other altcoins record significant gains while Bitcoin’s dominance cools off. For context, over 75% of the top 50 crypto have outperformed BTC in the last 90 days. Breakout And Then Moon In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto suggested that an Ethereum price breakout was imminent. He stated that once ETH escapes the 3-year symmetrical triangle, it will rally to new heights. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that Ethereum could surpass its current all-time high (ATH) at $4,800 and rally as high as $7,000. Related Reading: Cardano Next In Line After XRP? ADA Price Targets $4.88 In Epic Breakout Crypto analyst Venture Founder also made a similar $7,000 prediction for the Ethereum price. This came as he highlighted a giant cup and handle triangle that has been forming for Ethereum since 2021. The analyst added that ETH could explode once it confirms the breakout above the $3,800 range. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $3,670, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

According to blockchain data from Arkham, the transactions involved transferring significant amounts of Ether (ETH), Binance USD (BUSD), and other tokens to two unidentified wallet addresses. US Government Continuous Transfer Spree The transfers included 5,024 ETH, valued at approximately $18 million, and 13.5 million BUSD. The transactions were sent to addresses starting with “0x9cd” and “0x9ac,” raising questions about the purpose and destination of these funds. Alongside the substantial ETH and BUSD transfers, the government also moved $1.5 million worth of Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens and a variety of smaller cryptocurrencies to the same addresses. The activity involves managing crypto assets seized by the U.S. government due to legal cases. The government has done similar transfers, usually before auctions or sales. These actions aim to recover money for victims or to cover losses from criminal activities. While the exact purpose of these transfers remains unclear, the movement of such large sums has sparked speculation within the crypto community. US Government $1.9 Billion Bitcoin Transfer Meanwhile, the government recently transferred nearly 19,800 Bitcoin, worth about $1.9 billion, to Coinbase. This transfer has raised eyebrows, prompting executives, analysts, and crypto advocates to call it a strategic misstep. United States Space Force engineer Jason Lowery was quick to voice his concerns on social media, declaring that the government’s actions reflect a lack of understanding of the true value of Bitcoin. “There is no price where it makes sense for the US to sell any Bitcoin it has under its control,” Lowery remarked, highlighting the broader implications of such a decision. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong weighed in on the controversy, echoing Lowery’s sentiments, stating that the government should not consider selling its Bitcoin . So far, the US government has moved 25,999 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $2.49 billion, to Coinbase this year. US Government to Ensure Transparency and Accountability Recall that the United States government transferred $922 million worth of seized BTC in February . This transfer came hot on the heels of Bitcoin’s price breaking the $60,000 barrier. As reported by TheCoinRise, the transferred funds were from two cryptocurrency wallets confiscated from Bitfinex in 2016. Bitfinex, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange, had faced legal scrutiny and regulatory actions, resulting in the seizure of funds by US authorities . The government’s decision to transfer these wallets underscores the complexities of managing seized cryptocurrency holdings amidst a rapidly fluctuating market. The transfer also highlights the need for clear frameworks to address the handling and de[osition of seized cryptocurrencies. The US government’s actions ensure transparency and accountability in law enforcement actions.

37214788,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622549,1733327662,The Fed’s reaction to Trump’s tariffs will be powerful – and quite negative,"Donald Trump’s promise to unleash massive tariffs on imports the second he’s back in the Oval could spark a chain reaction from the Federal Reserve that he might not anticipate—or like. The US central bank, led by Jerome Powell, has battled inflation with aggressive rate hikes since 2022, and Trump’s tariff plans could throw a wrench into their already delicate balancing act. The result? Rising costs for everyone and a central bank stuck between fighting inflation and avoiding economic disaster. Trump’s talking about a 20% charge on all imports and up to 60% for goods from China. Just last week, he threatened 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada—two of the biggest U.S. trading partners—on his first day back in office. For businesses, that means skyrocketing costs. For the Fed, it means an inflation headache. Tariffs will force the Fed’s hand The Federal Reserve’s job is to keep inflation in check and the economy steady. But tariffs, like the ones Trump’s proposing, make that nearly impossible. They push up prices across the board. Businesses pass these higher costs to consumers, and suddenly, the inflation fight that Powell has been waging for years gets a whole lot harder. In Trump’s first term, the Fed ran simulations to predict the economic effects of a 15% tariff hike on all imports. The results were bleak. Fed economists forecasted that costs for households and businesses would rise, spending would drop, and inflation would spike temporarily. To soften the blow, they suggested cutting interest rates. That was back when inflation was under control. Now, the situation is worse. Inflation hit a 40-year high in 2022 and is still above the Fed’s 2% target. Powell and his team can’t afford to let it climb again, even if it’s caused by tariffs. The Fed is unlikely to respond with rate cuts this time around. Instead, they might be forced into rate hikes—exactly the kind of move Trump hated during his first term. Justin Weidner, an economist at Deutsche Bank, says the Fed could even skip planned rate cuts entirely. “Temporary price increases from tariffs could keep the Fed on the sidelines,” he explains. But the real challenge is messaging. Powell can’t downplay inflation spikes after the Fed’s post-pandemic blunder of calling inflation “transitory.” That mistake damaged their credibility, and they’re not about to repeat it. Instead, Bloomberg predicts they’ll likely label any tariff-driven inflation as “elevated due to tariff effects” to separate it from broader economic trends. Trump’s day-one plan: Tariffs and chaos Raising costs for imported goods could hurt businesses and consumers, leading to higher prices everywhere—from grocery stores to construction sites. Powell has been clear that the Fed will respond to policies only after they’re enacted. This means Trump’s tariff plans won’t factor into the Fed’s December meeting, where a rate cut is expected. But the January meeting—just days after Trump’s inauguration—will be a different story if his Day-One tariffs go live. The Fed will need to act fast if inflation spikes. This isn’t uncharted territory for Powell. In 2018, the Fed ran an exercise to prepare for a tariff-driven inflation scenario. They assumed a 15% hike on all non-oil imports, paired with retaliatory tariffs from trade partners. The results were ugly. Inflation rose sharply in the short term, while productivity plummeted as industries scrambled to adjust. Fed economists proposed two responses: raise rates to fight inflation or cut rates to support growth. They chose the latter, betting that tariff-driven inflation would fade quickly. But that decision came with a major assumption: stable price expectations. Today, that assumption no longer holds. Inflation has been anything but stable since the pandemic, and Powell knows better than to gamble on short-term spikes resolving themselves. Beyond tariffs: Trump’s other plans Trump’s economic plans go beyond tariffs, creating even more uncertainty for the Fed. His proposed tax cuts could drive consumer demand through the roof, adding more inflationary pressure. At the same time, his threats of mass deportations could destabilize the labor market, disrupt industries, and shrink the economy. In 2018, Trump’s tax cuts boosted inflation, prompting the Fed to raise rates. A year later, they reversed course with rate cuts to counter a slowing economy. Powell can expect a similar balancing act this time, with Trump’s economic policies pulling the economy in opposite directions. Trump’s relationship with the Fed was rocky during his first term, and there’s no reason to believe it will improve. He frequently bashed Powell for keeping rates too high, accusing the Fed of undermining his economic agenda. If tariffs push inflation up again, Powell could become Trump’s favorite punching bag. This year, the Fed began cautiously cutting rates after the most aggressive hiking cycle since the 1980s. Powell has stressed the importance of being data-driven, but Trump’s tariffs could force his hand. “Six years ago, inflation was low, and expectations were anchored,” Powell said recently. “Now, inflation is still running above 2%. We’ll take all that into account.” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/fed-reaction-to-trumptariff-will-be-powerful/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37214788.jpeg

Nobody,” Putin said at an investment conference in Moscow on Wednesday. “And who can prohibit the use of other electronic means of payment? Nobody. Because these are new technologies and no matter what happens to the dollar, these tools will develop one way or another because everyone will strive to reduce costs and increase reliability,” he said.  Just last week, Putin signed a law classifying digital currencies as a form of property in foreign trade settlements under an experimental legal regime, taking a significant step in cryptocurrency regulation.  The action was part of the country’s evolving strategy to circumvent Western sanctions that have hit the country's economy following its invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions from countries including the U.S. have spurred Russia to legalize cross-border payments with cryptocurrencies, though they remain banned from being used as legal tender.  Russia has also been experimenting with a central bank digital currency (CBDC) which is expected to launch in July 2025.

What Awaits Next?,"Bitcoin, which had a big rally after Donald Trump's victory, has been trending sideways in recent days. While the upward trend in BTC slowed down, altcoins went on the offensive this time. While altcoins such as XRP and Tron (TRX) are in the focus of the market with their rise, 10x Research CEO Markus Thielen said that the altcoin season has begun. Stating that while Bitcoin's market dominance decreased to 53.80%, altcoins such as XRP, XLM, and HBAR made gains exceeding 400%, Thielen stated that the altcoin season will continue. “Altcoin season has started to be priced in and this trend will continue. Potentially, trading opportunities will continue to expand.” Markus Thielen said that he thinks the demand for altcoins, and therefore the rise, will continue until Donald Trump's inauguration in January. Referring to the rise of XRP, Thielen stated that the rally gained momentum with the breaking of a long-term technical formation after the US elections and said, “The XRP rally is extraordinary and will continue.” Finally, the analyst Markus Thielen added that the XRP price fluctuation does not indicate a slowdown in the market's upward trend and that Ethereum and Solana will lead the crypto market as altcoin season has arrived. *This is not investment advice.

Robot Musk (MUSKROBO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKROBO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Robot Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Robot Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Robot Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Robot Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Robot Musk by entering its contract address – KuyNyMswF1p3jYpJwNCsfeM86pnhjMb6urb3EKyNVje – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKROBO.

After peaking at $99,400, it faced strong resistance and has since traded in a narrow range. Currently priced at $95,782, Bitcoin has increased 1.93% in the last 24 hours and 1.57% over the past week.Reduced Profit-Taking ActivityIn light of these fluctuations, Glassnode, an on-chain analytics firm, suggests that Bitcoin's market dynamics have shifted into consolidation. The data reveals a significant decline in daily realized profits, which have dropped by 42% from their peak on November 16. Glassnode reported that the average realized profits on exchanges now stand at $277 million per day, a stark contrast to the $481 million per day observed earlier. This drop in profit-taking suggests that many traders are holding their positions, contributing to Bitcoin's stagnant price. Bitcoin Holders Adding to Price StagnationMeanwhile, another analyst, James Check, has highlighted the influence of long-term holders on Bitcoin's current price behavior. Check pointed out that contrary to popular belief, long-term holders do sell at times, and their actions have been a significant factor in the ongoing consolidation. He compares the market to a car, where demand is the accelerator and the sell-side pressure acts as the brakes. While demand remains strong, fueled by institutional involvement and the launch of Bitcoin ETFs, the ongoing sell-side pressure from long-term holders has kept the price from making substantial gains. This balancing act between buying and selling activity has created a market stuck in a holding pattern, unable to break above key resistance levels.Bullish Outlook Despite ResistanceDespite the ongoing tension between the bulls and bears, industry experts remain optimistic about Bitcoin's future trajectory. Tom Lee, Chief Investment Officer at Fundstrat, continues to project that Bitcoin will break through the psychological barrier of $100,000 before the end of the year. Lee has emphasized that this level is a critical point of interest for traders and investors, and overcoming it could trigger a significant price surge. Furthermore, Lee has highlighted Bitcoin's potential to reach $250,000 in the next 12 months, driven by factors like institutional adoption and growing support for cryptocurrencies within the U.S. political landscape.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/04/bitcoin-daily-realized-profits-drop-42-cooling-off-to-277m-per-day/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-daily-realized-profits-drop-42-cooling-off-to-277m-per-day,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
37216293,https://cryptonews.com/?p=316188,1733326779,Safe Aims for Visa-Like Crypto Payments with Safenet Cross-Chain Transactions,"Safe, a leading multi-signature wallet and digital assets platform, has unveiled Safenet, its ambitious blockchain transaction processor network. Safenet aims to transform the handling of on-chain and cross-chain transactions. SAY GM TO SAFENET We are here to move the world's GDP onchain. https://t.co/WkBM6O26hN pic.twitter.com/8duPs9Gb62 — Safe | Safenet (@safe) December 3, 2024 With a vision to move the world’s GDP on-chain, Safenet draws inspiration from VisaNet, the payment network that powers Visa. Safenet is scheduled for an initial alpha release in early 2025 and is poised to become a cornerstone of decentralized finance (DeFi) by addressing critical liquidity, scalability, and interoperability inefficiencies. Safenet Architecture: Will This Enable Cross-Chain Transactions? Lukas Schor, co-founder of Safe, described Safenet as a groundbreaking solution designed to replicate the speed and efficiency of traditional payment systems within the crypto space. This is very similar to Visa, where swiping a card does not right away lead to a transfer of money. Instead, Visa is reserving the card’s balance, doing security checks, and issuing a payment guarantee to the merchant. The settlement only follows days later. — lukasschor.eth (@SchorLukas) December 3, 2024 Like VisaNet, which guarantees instant payments for merchants while settling funds days later, Safenet aims to enable similarly rapid transaction guarantees in the on-chain ecosystem. Schor explained that this innovation will remove barriers posed by latency and fragmentation, which have historically limited blockchain adoption for global transactions. The real power comes from Safenet being an open system where various “processors” can provide their unique features as part of the transaction lifecycle. Here's a few ideas… pic.twitter.com/j30l5DdA5V — lukasschor.eth (@SchorLukas) December 3, 2024 At its core, Safenet operates as a decentralized transaction processor network rather than a blockchain. It functions as a connecting layer for existing networks, enabling users to manage cross-chain transactions and interactions through a single account. Safenet Processors handle transaction execution by temporarily reserving user assets through smart account resource locks. These processors can issue execution guarantees and complete transactions using external liquidity sources, such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and lending platforms. In essence, the processors separate transaction execution from settlement, mimicking VisaNet’s ability to guarantee payments instantly while completing settlement processes later. The Liquidity Network, meanwhile, aggregates liquidity from a range of DeFi services to support seamless cross-chain operations. By leveraging these liquidity pools, Safenet aims to eliminate the delays typically associated with bridging funds across Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) blockchains. This architecture not only enhances transaction speeds—offering execution guarantees within 500 milliseconds—but also ensures scalability by unifying user balances across diverse ecosystems, including Ethereum, Solana, and non-EVM-compatible chains. The network also enforces user-defined policies and advanced security checks to safeguard users against common risks like address poisoning. Validators within the Safenet ecosystem monitor processor activities and can flag or challenge malicious transactions. These validators are incentivized through rewards paid in the SAFE token. Use Cases and Long-Term Vision According to the announcement , Safenet will unlock many use cases, from simple cross-chain payments to complex financial arrangements. For example, under-collateralized loans become possible through trusted processors, enabling users to finance purchases like NFTs with a small down payment while securing the remaining amount through the network. This resembles traditional financial tools such as mortgages, offering crypto users greater flexibility without requiring full collateralization upfront. Source: safe.global Other use cases include off-exchange settlement, where Safenet could allow users to trade on centralized exchanges (CEXs) while maintaining full custody of their assets, subscription-based payments, etc. Safenet’s introduction is part of Safe’s mission to move the world’s economy on-chain. The platform already boasts over $100 billion in total value locked (TVL) and over 30 million accounts. The SAFE token underpins the entire Safenet ecosystem, aligning incentives for processors, validators, and users. Processors must stake SAFE tokens to participate, with staking requirements scaled to transaction volumes. Validators ensure security and compliance, staking SAFE tokens and earning a share of transaction fees as rewards. The Safenet is expected to release alpha in Q1 2025, focusing on basic cross-chain accounts and limited assets.

Tron founder Justin Sun proudly highlighted the achievement in a post on X today. Specifically, on Tuesday, December 3, Tron saw a total revenue of $21.66 million, representing an all-time high for a single day. TRON network revenue chart Notably, the network posted a one-day revenue of around $10.92 million on the previous day. This marked a staggering 98% increase compared to the figure from Tuesday. The massive change follows a similar turnaround in the market price of the network’s token, TRX.TRX Skyrockets by 99% But Dumps LaterTRX traded as low as $0.2204 yesterday, but by midnight, in one fell swoop, the price skyrocketed to an all-time high of $0.4407. This represented a 99.96% growth within one day, making it the best-performing asset among the most prominent cryptocurrencies.Meanwhile, TRX quickly plummeted after the abrupt price pump. At press time, TRX is trading at $0.356, having lost 19.21% of its gains.Nonetheless, the improved price of TRX, coupled with increased interest in the network for stablecoin and meme coin activities, has raised Tron network revenue to historic heights.Tron Sees $1.91 Billion in Yearly RevenueIt’s worth mentioning that Tron’s revenue has been on an upward trend this year. This momentum picked up in August following the introduction of the token deployment platform, SunPump, which sought to rival Solana’s Pump.Fun.In one day, SunPump launched 7,351 meme coins, generating over half a million dollars in revenue. This activity spilled over to the Tron network, which saw $13 million in revenue in a single day on August 21, setting a historic high at the time.Currently, Tron’s 30-day revenue amounts to $242 million, up by 21% from the previous month. On a 90-day scale, the network has amassed $637.32 million in revenue, also up by 23% from the previous figure.

Tron ( TRX ) has been one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies, jumping by over 240% in the last 12 months. This surge was largely attributed to an X post from Justin Sun, who predicted that TRX would mirror the performance of XRP in recent weeks. Meanwhile, there are signs that Tron is on the verge of surpassing Tether ( USDT ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) in terms of fees made this year. Data from TokenTerminal shows that it has accrued over $1.84 billion in fees year-to-date. Cryptocurrencies by fees | Source: TokenTerminal Ethereum, the most profitable network in the crypto space, has made $2.30 billion this year, while Tether has brought in $2.1 billion. If Tron’s network growth continues at this pace, there are rising odds it will surpass these networks in the coming months. Tron’s network generates fees from the substantial transactions flowing within its blockchain. For instance, data from TronScan shows the network handled over $229 billion in USDT volume in the past 24 hours. It achieved this by processing over 2.1 billion transactions during the same period. Tron also reported over $10.57 billion in transactions in the last 24 hours, marking a 480% increase from the previous day. Additionally, the circulating supply of TRX tokens has been declining due to burning activities. It now stands at 86.29 billion , down from 88.5 billion in the same period a year earlier. TRX price analysis Tron price chart | Source: crypto.news The TRX token has maintained a bullish trend since bottoming at $0.04532 in 2022 and 2023. On the weekly chart, it has surged past the crucial resistance level at $0.1797, the upper side of the cup and handle pattern—one of the most popular bullish indicators. Tron has moved above all moving averages, while the MACD and Relative Strength Index have reached extreme overbought levels. The closely-watched Market Value to Realized Value indicator has risen to 2.8, still significantly below its all-time high of 6. This suggests that the Tron price may have more upside potential. This trend will be confirmed if TRX rises above this week’s high of $0.4488. If this occurs, the token could rally further as bulls target the key resistance level at $1. The bullish view would be invalidated if the Tron price falls below $0.1797, the upper side of the cup and handle pattern.

Through this partnership, travel companies can leverage Monerium’s on-chain payment capabilities and Camino Network’s scalable blockchain infrastructure to streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve profitability. Tackling inefficiencies in travel payments The global travel industry often operates on thin profit margins, with payment fees averaging 3% per transaction. This eats into earnings, where an EBIT of just 1% is often considered a success. By adopting Monerium’s blockchain-based payment system, travel businesses can drastically reduce payment costs while maintaining compliance with traditional financial regulations. Pablo Castillo, CEO of Chain4Travel (the lab behind Camino Network), highlighted the transformative potential of this collaboration: “By leveraging Monerium’s capabilities for blockchain-based on-ramping and settlement, we can drastically reduce payment costs and improve the bottom line for travel businesses. This partnership represents a major step forward in creating a more efficient and sustainable financial infrastructure for the travel industry.” Key benefits for the travel ecosystem Monerium’s EURe integrates seamlessly with Camino Network, offering businesses programmable transfers between IBAN accounts and web3 wallets. This capability eliminates the need for managing blockchain-native tokens, allowing companies to transact and settle payments on-chain using Euros. With instant SEPA transfers and automated smart contracts, businesses gain a competitive edge through reduced costs, improved efficiency, and enhanced transparency. The partnership also introduces significant advantages for consumers. With a zero-fee payment infrastructure, travel companies can pass savings on to customers through better pricing. Real-time transactions ensure smoother cross-border payments, enhancing the overall travel experience. For businesses, the integration opens new possibilities, including: Real-time trading of inventory. Automated commission settlements. Efficient cross-border payment handling. A bridge between blockchain and traditional finance Gísli Kristjánsson, co-founder and CEO of Monerium, emphasized the significance of this integration: “Adding EURe to the Camino Network shows our dedication to connecting traditional finance with blockchain. This partnership not only helps streamline transactions but also sets a powerful example of how on-chain fiat can transform industry-specific payment systems and create a more efficient financial future.” Future plans and pilot programs Monerium’s EURe will go live on Camino Network’s testnet by the end of 2024, with the mainnet launch planned for January 2025. Integration efforts are already underway, with pilot projects involving major players in the travel sector, such as Lufthansa Group and MTS. This collaboration signifies a significant leap forward for the travel industry, demonstrating how blockchain technology can bridge the gap between legacy financial systems and decentralized infrastructure. By combining Monerium’s on-chain payment solutions with Camino Network’s capabilities, the partnership sets a new standard for efficiency and innovation in travel payments.

37214061,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622569,1733326442,"Russia’s president Putin goes full-on pro-crypto, says no one can ban Bitcoin","Russia’s Vladimir Putin has made it official—Bitcoin is here to stay, and no one can ban it. Speaking at the Investment Forum in Moscow on December 4, Putin made it clear that he believes crypto is the future. The president seems to have gone pro-crypto now, though to be fair, he was never particularly against it . Just days before, Putin signed a groundbreaking law that legally classifies cryptocurrencies as “legal property.” Crypto taxes and strategic moves The law creates a solid legal framework for taxing crypto transactions and mining activities. Russia, already a crypto mining giant, is banking on bringing in up to 200 billion rubles ($2 billion) a year from mining alone. The Russian government, with Putin’s blessing, is pulling out all the stops to capitalize on its untapped crypto potential. The new law is nothing if not strategic. By exempting cryptocurrency mining and sales from the value-added tax (VAT), Russia is giving miners some breathing room. However, operators must still report their activities to local authorities. Skipping this requirement comes with a 40,000-ruble ($380) fine. For those trading crypto, income taxes apply. Earn up to 2.4 million rubles ($22,300), and you’ll pay 13%. Anything above that? A steep 15% rate kicks in. Corporate entities won’t escape either—they’ll face the standard corporate tax rate of 25% starting next year. Putin’s relationship with crypto Back in 2017, Putin wasn’t exactly a fan of cryptocurrencies, calling them risky for financial stability. But then, things changed. After meeting Vitalik Buterin, the guy behind Ethereum, the president saw the potential of blockchain tech. Russia quickly climbed to the top of the crypto mining ranks, second only to the U.S., after China bailed on mining in 2021. That growth came with a cost—huge energy demands. Putin flagged the risk of power shortages and slapped on tighter rules to manage the mining boom. Fast forward to 2020, and crypto got the green light in Russia—but with strings attached. By 2023, Putin was saying Russia shouldn’t miss the chance to use crypto for global trade. On the subject of Bitcoin national reserves, Putin said, “A legitimate question: why accumulate reserves if they can be lost so easily?” He believes it just makes more sense to use crypto instead.

Speaking on the first day of the 15th VTB Investment Forum, Putin has argued that Bitcoin and digital innovations will continue to develop. He noted that Russia and the BRICS are pursuing means to tap blockchain technology to make cross-border transactions easier.The president insisted that as the world’s dependence on the dollar is reducing, countries globally are pursuing newer, better alternatives to settlement. Notably, he mentioned Bitcoin as an emerging means of transactional settlements.Putin Says No One Can Ban BitcoinThe Russian president described Bitcoin as a decentralized technological innovation. He noted that no government or country can control the asset or ban its usage. Hence, Russia and the global market are turning their attention to the digital asset, with the president calling the move “inevitable.”. Putin further asserted that the use of Bitcoin would continue to go mainstream as countries pursue means to ease cross-border transactional costs and trade more reliably.Putin Said , "" Who can ban Bitcoin? Nobody. And who can prohibit using other electronic means of payment? Nobody. Because these are new technologies, and no matter what happens to the dollar, these tools will happen one way or another because everyone will strive to reduce costs and increase reliability."" Notably, Russia has adopted the use of cryptocurrencies for cross-border payments. In August, Putin signed a bill in collaboration with the Bank of Russia, allowing the country to transact with other international bodies using Bitcoin.Russia’s Easing Stance on CryptocurrencyMeanwhile, the Russian government has continued to change its stance toward cryptocurrency over the years. Previously, the mining of digital assets was strictly prohibited in the country.However, as Western sanctions rained down on Russia, it turned to other means of secure transactional settlements. Meanwhile, the state has eased its stern crypto disposition, viewing the currency as a means of payment uncontrolled by any government.For context, In August, Russia passed a bill allowing crypto mining in the state. Furthermore, a November tax bill signed by Putin classified Bitcoin as property , a warmer embrace of the emerging asset.However, the use of cryptocurrency with the Russian border remains prohibited. The impediment has persisted despite reports that 10% of the country’s population owns cryptocurrency.Meanwhile, Putin noted during the conference today that Russia and the BRICS are pursuing ways of adopting the nascent sector.

Backed, Sonic (S) – formerly Fantom ( FTM ) – and Chainlink ( LINK ) announced their collaboration on Dec. 4. In a press release shared with crypto.news, the companies noted that this tokenization initiative marks the first step in their quest to bring traditional financial assets on-chain. Chainlink and Sonic will assist Backed in tokenizing Fortlake’s fund via permissionless tokens. These tokens will be collateralized 1:1, with their price pegged to real-time net asset value. According to the platforms, this design creates decentralized finance-ready tokens that will be usable within Sonic’s expanding ecosystem. “This is one of the first steps for Sonic in its pathway to tokenizing financial assets across the globe and bringing the advantages of Sonic technology to traditional financial institutions” Sam Harcourt, business development lead at Sonic. Fund shares will utilize Chainlink SmartData for NAV data, while Chainlink Proof of Reserves will verify collateralized assets and assets under management.

The aggressive surge since November 5 appears to be cooling off, with market attention gradually shifting toward altcoins. Despite the slowdown, Bitcoin remains a cornerstone of market strength, holding firmly above the critical $90,000 support level. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Keep Buying – DOGE Metrics Reveal Demand Remains Strong Key data from CryptoQuant highlights two significant outflows exceeding 8,000 BTC each from Coinbase in the past 24 hours, signaling sustained institutional interest and potential accumulation. These outflows suggest that major players remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, even as short-term price action steadies. As Bitcoin maintains its consolidation phase, the broader crypto market is poised for dynamic changes. Analysts are closely watching whether this stabilization period will pave the way for BTC’s next leg upward or signal an opportunity for altcoins to take the spotlight. The next few days will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin reclaims momentum or continues its current range-bound movement. Bitcoin Leading A Heated Market Bitcoin continues to lead the crypto market with remarkable gains, even as it halts just below the highly anticipated $100,000 level. The current pause in its rally has triggered a liquidity shift, gradually pumping capital into the altcoin market. However, analysts and investors anticipate that Bitcoin may slow down in the short term after its aggressive recent surge, providing an opportunity for other cryptocurrencies to shine. Metrics from CryptoQuant highlight notable activity on Coinbase, where two massive outflows, exceeding 8,000 BTC each, were recorded in the last 24 hours. A total of 19,487 BTC, valued at an average price of $96,043, was withdrawn in these transactions, amounting to approximately $1.87 billion. Such significant movements indicate the involvement of institutional players or whales who may be positioning themselves for Bitcoin’s next major move. Historically, market dips have followed similar outflows, as large transactions often signal profit-taking or redistribution of holdings. However, these transactions could also suggest growing confidence among major investors in Bitcoin’s long-term potential.

Price Levels To Watch Bitcoin is trading at $96,700, continuing a range-bound movement between $93,500 and $98,700 without establishing a clear direction. This consolidation follows a period of aggressive rallies, with BTC approaching but not yet surpassing its all-time high. Market participants are closely watching the $90,000 mark, which has proven to be a critical level of support. Holding above this level has been essential in signaling market strength and sustaining bullish momentum. If Bitcoin maintains its position above the $95,000 mark over the next few days, the likelihood of a breakout to new all-time highs becomes significantly stronger. A stable consolidation above this level would fuel buyers to push BTC past the psychological $100,000 barrier. Conversely, losing the $95,000 support would raise concerns, potentially prompting a test of the $90,000 level again. Should this key level fail, Bitcoin could experience a deeper correction with lower support zones.

On-chain analyst Ki Young Ju tells his 381,200 followers on the social media platform X that, unlike past cycles, liquidity can no longer flow at the same levels from Bitcoin ( BTC ) into altcoins, sending them soaring. The analyst says there is now massive traditional finance participation in Bitcoin, including through spot market BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and increased buying by software company MicroStrategy (MSTR). “This alt season won’t be what you expected. It’s going to be weird and challenging. Only a chosen few will win the game. Market sentiment is good, but there isn’t much fresh liquidity. Bitcoin is drifting away from the crypto ecosystem. Bitcoin has built its own paper-based layer-2 ecosystem through ETFs, MSTR, funds and more. In this paper-based L2 Bitcoin bridging to other altcoins is impossible.” He also shares a chart showing Bitcoin’s price correlation with alts. A score of 1 is the highest correlation, whereas the lowest correlation possible is 0. “Altcoins used to move together based on their correlation with BTC, but that pattern has now broken. Only a few are starting to show independent trends as they attract new liquidity.” Source: Ki Young Ju/X The analyst notes that spot market BTC ETFs have accumulated as much as is believed to have been mined by Bitcoin’s pseudonymous founder Satoshi Nakamoto in the early days of the cryptocurrency’s existence. “Bitcoin spot ETFs now hold as much BTC as Satoshi Nakamoto (Patoshi).” Source: Ki Young Ju/X He also says that investor demand for the ETF product is returning to its historical high. “Bitcoin ETF demand is as strong as at their initial approval this year.” Source: Ki Young Ju/X Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

37214555,https://blockworks.co/news/roger-ver-fights-tax-fraud-charges,1733326200,Roger Ver ready to fight over $50M in BTC taxes,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Bitcoin Jesus will not go quietly into the night…or pay $50 million in alleged unpaid taxes. Roger Ver, who was arrested in Spain in April of this year, is arguing that the Department of Justice’s tax fraud charges are “unconstitutional.” The DOJ filed a “defective indictment,” Ver’s lawyers say , that misquotes communications between Ver and his legal teams and — stop me if you’ve heard this one before — “hangs on a semblance of regulatory clarity that never existed.” Ver’s defense claims that Bitcoin Jesus tried to get ahead of the murky tax code in 2014 (which, to be fair, is still a bit unclear 10 years on) by hiring an unnamed law firm to consult on his decision to leave the US. As part of that, they conducted a hypothetical scenario where Ver sold all of his holdings, but the thing is, as Ver’s lawyers explained, he couldn’t sell his bitcoin back in 2014. “On March 2, 2014, however, such a sale was likely impossible as a technological matter and catastrophic as a matter of market value. At the time, BTC was a thinly traded market with a limited number of active traders,” the filing said. And, unfortunately, the only marketplace to really sell off large amounts of bitcoin was Mt. Gox — which had just collapsed. So Ver, along with multiple tax experts and attorneys, had basically tried to calculate unrealized gains and exit taxes with all that in mind. Per his lawyers, Ver was also exploring the cost if he was personally on the hook for bitcoin held by his companies. Obviously, with this being a tax case, there’s a lot of back and forth about the unrealized gains, and Ver’s previous communications regarding his bitcoin sales and how he recorded his bitcoin holdings. But essentially, the motion to dismiss falls back on the fact that the current tax code — and by current, I also mean the framework that existed in 2014 — didn’t really account for crypto. The indictment relies “on impermissibly vague laws that, at all relevant times, provided no basis for a person of reasonable intelligence to understand the proper application of tax laws to digital currencies; and they rely on the government’s persistent trampling on basic rights and notions of fair play,” his team argued. The timing of this filing is what’s really interesting. Ver is set, as of right now, for a trial in lower Manhattan starting in early February of next year that could see him potentially extradited to the US. We’ve talked endlessly about the incoming administration and its seemingly favorable view of crypto and Manhattan prosecutors, to this point, are already reducing the amount of crypto cases they go after. Whether or not Bitcoin Jesus can succeed in getting his case tossed is up to the judge at this point, but I bet his team feels there couldn’t have been a more perfect time for this filing.

DTX Exchange gains attention ahead of its tier-1 exchange launch. The Dogecoin chart shows a bullish formation after weekly consolidation; it has formed the bullish crossover pattern, which is the bullish reversal pattern. DOGE is one of the early movers, and its strength means that the second upswing in the crypto market is coming soon. This makes the current time best for choosing the right coins, which can generate tremendous returns. One name on the priority watchlist of expert investors is the hybrid trading platform – DTX Exchange. DTX Exchange is at an important juncture because industry experts predict its launch in tier-1 exchanges next month.

Dogecoin (DOGE) has emerged as a standout performer in the ongoing bull market, reaching price levels last seen in 2021. Despite a weekly market-wide correction, the meme coin has surged by an impressive 159% in November. After the recent bullish runup, Dogecoin has been trading sideways, absorbing the selling. DOGE price has formed a volatility contraction pattern with the golden crossover, indicating bullish price action. Additionally, a high volume has been observed in the Dogecoin price volume. In the past 24 hours, activity around Dogecoin has surged, with over 439 million DOGE—worth more than $184 million—transferred across four major transactions. Whale Alert, a blockchain data tracker, flagged these movements, drawing significant attention from the crypto community. In another development, Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s ETF expert, suggested that Dec. 31 could be an ideal date to file for a Dogecoin ETF. If asset managers explore this opportunity, it could attract substantial capital to the market, potentially driving a significant increase in Dogecoin’s price. DTX Exchange’s revenue-sharing model attracts dividend investors Investors who prefer to invest in instruments that give fixed returns in intervals of time can now invest in the crypto sector with DTX Exchange . DTX’s revenue sharing program, known as the VIP rebate program, will allow investors to earn up to 3% of exchange revenue from various sources like trading fees. The VIP rebate program’s staking feature adds an advantage for investors. With it, investors can earn up to 33% APY, among the industry’s highest. These features help investors generate passive income and appreciate the price of assets. Along with dividend investors, momentum investors who seek high gains in a short period have kept DTX Exchange on the priority list.

37213733,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51349,1733325912,Ripple CTO Calls XRP Ledger Validators to Take This Action ASAP,"David Schwartz, Chief Technology Officer at Ripple, issued an urgent message to validators across the XRP Ledger (XRPL), urging them to upgrade to the newly released rippled 2.3.0 software. The call comes after a bug caused a temporary network pause on November 25, 2024. According to a blog post by Brad Chase, VP of Engineering at RippleX, the disruption was traced to a bug in the caching layer of the rippled server software. Validators, please upgrade to rippled 2.3.0 ASAP to ensure XRPL's stability and security. https://t.co/yMN6Ehc5RC — David ""JoelKatz"" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) December 3, 2024 This bug introduced more than six months ago, occasionally caused the caching mechanism to return inconsistent result types, leading to server crashes under specific conditions. Although undetected during initial testing, there is no evidence of prior exploitation. Details of the Network Pause At 13:39 UTC, several XRPL nodes crashed and restarted simultaneously, halting the network’s ability to process transactions for approximately 10 minutes. The network’s consensus mechanism prioritized safety during the instability, ensuring no loss of funds, and full transaction processing resumed by 13:49 UTC. Chase explained that RippleX identified the issue during recent testing of rippled 2.3.0 and included a fix in the update. To mitigate risks, the team withheld detailed technical information about the bug, preventing potential reverse engineering that could enable exploitation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Following the mainnet incident, RippleX validated the fix and collaborated with the community and the Unique Node List (UNL) operators to ensure a coordinated response. By 1:30 UTC on November 26, the community had responded swiftly. According to Chase, 33 of 35 validators on the default UNL had already upgraded to rippled 2.3.0, along with nearly half of all known servers. However, Chase emphasized the need for remaining node operators to update their infrastructure promptly to avoid potential vulnerabilities. Chase also noted that RippleX deliberately delayed isolating the issue or releasing a standalone patch before the mainnet incident, citing concerns that this could increase security risks. He added that RippleX plans to disclose more technical details about the bug on December 12, 2024, to allow additional time to upgrade unpatched nodes. According to Chase, if such details are shared, the vulnerability can be identified and exploited easily. That’s why the upgrade is imported. RippleX pledged to continue refining the system to enhance its security and reliability. Schwartz also weighed in on the network pause recently, explaining why this was different from previous network outages suffered by Solana, highlighting the reliability of the XRPL, as the network recovered by itself. For node operators and XRPL users, upgrading to rippled 2.3.0 is essential to ensuring the long-term stability and security of the ledger.

Currently, XRP is trading at $2.70 after experiencing a more than fourfold price surge since November. This impressive price action has elevated XRP to become the third-largest crypto asset by market cap, trailing only Bitcoin and Ethereum.Notably, XRP reached its current position faster than many anticipated. It was trading in the $1 range just two days ago, and since entering the $2 range, it has continued to rise and is now looking to hit $3.Amid this, market analysts like Ben Armstrong are voicing their opinions on where XRP could go before cooling off from its streak of giant green candles.XRP Next Stop is $4.50In a tweet , Armstrong suggested that $4.50 is the next target XRP for XRP, urging market participants to prepare for the wave. This price point would mark a fresh all-time high.With XRP at $2.70 at the time of writing, reaching $4.50 would require an additional growth of 67%. For a coin that has already seen over 100% gains in under seven days, XRP proponents believe this new projected level is within reach.At the $4.50 price point, XRP’s market cap would rise to $256 billion, bringing it closer to Ethereum's valuation.Commenting on BitBoy’s tweet, community members shared even more optimistic outlooks for XRP’s next stop before a potential consolidation phase. Analyst Mack suggested a $10 price target, while another argued that the ongoing uptrend could continue for another 12 days before a retracement.Take Profit and Exit XRPHowever, amid the optimism around XRP’s growth, critics are raising red flags, cautioning holders to take their accrued profits and exit the market.Analyst “ElonTrades” has called on XRP holders not to get caught in a ""roundtrip"" this time, urging them to take their current 4X profit ""and run."" He shared a chart showing that in at least two instances in recent history when XRP experienced towering candlesticks, a major price slump followed shortly after. As a result, he has advised moving profits into other underperforming crypto assets while there’s still an opportunity.

The partnership brings Monerium and its popular EURe, the on-chain euro, to the Camino Network, allowing users to execute transactions for travel businesses. Under the agreement, Monerium’s solution will enable businesses on the Camino Network to connect traditional bank accounts with Web3 wallets while staying compatible with banking systems such as SEPA. Monerium’s EURe will also be available on Camino Messenger, a distribution and sourcing protocol for the global travel industry. Some big names in the travel industry, like Lufthansa Group, MTS, and Invia, are already connecting to it. The collaboration is set to create more efficient payment methods for users in the travel industry, addressing pain points such as high fees and complex, lengthy reconciliation processes. Camino Network says it wants to reduce the high cost of trust due to total reliance on traditional payment systems in the travel industry. ""The travel industry operates on razor-thin margins, with an EBIT of just 1% often considered a success. Payments, which typically cost an average of 3% per transaction, eat into these already narrow profits. By leveraging Monerium's capabilities for blockchain-based on-ramping and settlement, we can drastically reduce payment costs and improve the bottom line for travel businesses. This partnership represents a major step forward in creating a more efficient and sustainable financial infrastructure for the travel industry,” said Pablo Castillo, Chain4Travel CEO (Camino Network Lab). Monerium’s on-chain fiat solution, combined with Camino Network’s blockchain infrastructure, is poised to deliver significant benefits to both consumers and travel companies. Consumers will enjoy better pricing thanks to low agency fees and faster cross-border payments enabled by blockchain. Meanwhile, travel companies can optimize their operations by managing inventory in real-time, automating settlements, and processing payments more efficiently.

37213400,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373438,1733325428,Real World Assets: an Emerging Reality in an Inevitable Future,"The crypto industry has been booming, with discussions about the future of trading financial assets, as well as the possibility of putting them on-chain. Some of the major players in the financial world, such as BlackRock, are starting to take notice of the transformative power of blockchain-based technology. This begs the question of what’s next. And in this conversation, real-world assets (RWAs) have definitely emerged as a frontier, capturing the spotlight with their potential. RWAs: A Rapidly Evolving Landscape The tokenization of real-world assets is undoubtedly reshaping the field of traditional finance, merging tangible assets with blockchain technology. This intersection has already created an expanding ecosystem where traditional assets are revamped and put on the blockchain as digital tokens. The growth of this sub-section is evident, demonstrating the increased adoption of asset tokenization, as well as its potential to reimagine financial markets. Some experts are forecasting that tokenizing illiquid assets could unlock a market worth up to $4 trillion by 2030 – an ambitious projection highlighting the scale of the opportunity, as well as blockchain’s ability to solve inefficiencies in the world of traditional finance. What is Behind the Growth of RWAs? There are several factors that fuel the rapid expansion of the real-world asset market and they are setting the stage for a paradigm shift in the way financial assets are being traded and even managed. These include, but are not limited to: Improved Liquidity In essence, tokenization aims to convert assets that could be traditionally illiquid into tokens that are very easy to trade. This is capable of increasing the liquidity, which could play a transformative role for certain specific areas such as real estate, private equity, and art – all fields that have historically required long holding periods, while also being subjected to relatively high barriers to entry. Fractional Ownership One of the more exciting aspects of RWAs is the ability to divide high-value assets into smaller, tradable units. This opens up opportunities for a broader range of investors, democratizing access to assets like commercial properties or rare commodities. Transparency and Security The immutability provided by blockchain technology delivers unparalleled transparency, which also means that the transactions will be tamper-proof. This reduces the risk of fraud, but it also builds trust in the market. Cost Efficiency One of blockchain’s long-lasting promises is that of eliminating intermediaries, thereby reducing transactional friction and improving cost efficiency. What Are Some of the Real-World Applications of RWAs? And while the above might sound appealing, it’s also important to dive deeper into some of the practical applications of RWAs, which demonstrate their transformative potential. Real Estate Investors can now buy digital shares of physical properties, significantly lowering the investment threshold. This innovation makes real estate—a traditionally high-barrier asset—more accessible to individual investors. Commodities Commodity-backed tokens have emerged as a strong use case, with the market capitalization for such tokens reaching $1.1 billion. Gold has proven to be the most popular asset for tokenization, offering a stable and universally recognized store of value. Treasury Products Tokenized treasury products have witnessed phenomenal growth, increasing by 782% in 2023 alone. Valued at over $931 million, these products highlight the growing appetite for blockchain-based financial instruments within institutional and retail markets. While the above statistics are impressive, they are also representative of just a fraction of the impact that RWAs could potentially have on the global financial world. The integration of real-world assets into blockchain technology signals a shift in how we perceive and interact with the broader financial system. Companies like BlackRock—the world’s largest asset manager—are already starting to explore the possibilities, meaning that the era of tokenized assets is no longer just a distant vision but an emerging reality.

Mantle (MNT): RSI and Optimistic Rollups Signal Room for Growth Mantle (MNT) has also captured investor attention. As a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, Mantle leverages Optimistic Rollup technology to enhance transaction speed and reduce costs. Its native token, MNT, saw a 16.91% gain in the last 24 hours, reaching $1.08 after nearly doubling its value since November’s start. Source: CoinMarketCap / MNT The Fear & Greed Index for Mantle markets reflects extreme optimism, with a reading of 84, suggesting a positive investor outlook.

In 2023, the coin experienced significant losses, primarily on account of Binance’s legal and regulatory troubles. By October 2023, BNB prices had dropped to as low as $210. However, it spent the first quarter of 2024 on an upward trajectory. The recovery has been impressive, to say the least —by mid-March, the digital asset was trading at approximately $600. Afterward, BNB traded sideways in the $450 to $600 range until the wider cryptocurrency bull run ignited in early November. At press time, Binance Coin was trading at $771.16 — on the weekly chart, BNB gained 23.65%, bringing monthly returns to 38.42% and year-to-date (YTD) gains up to 150.27%. BNB currently has a market capitalization of approximately $111.27 billion — making it the fifth-largest cryptocurrency in the world, ahead of Solana ( SOL ) and Dogecoin ( DOGE ), and behind Tether ( USDT ). BNB price YTD chart. Source: Finbold As Bitcoin ( BTC ) has stalled on its path to $100,000 , investors are increasingly turning their attention to altcoins. Being one of the most established, as well as imminently tied to the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, BNB has unique advantages that attract investments. Finbold has consulted one of the most powerful publicly available large language models for additional clarity and insight as to what price BNB could be trading at by the end of 2024. ChatGPT-4o highlighted several bullish and bearish factors for BNB OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o outlined 4 bullish factors and just as many bearish ones when discussing BNB price predictions. On the bullish side of things, the large language model reflected on the significant growth that the BNB chain has experienced in the adoption of DeFi platforms, non-fungible token ( NFT ) marketplaces, and decentralized applications (dApps). BNB serves as the native coin used for transaction fees as well as staking on the network — so it stands to benefit greatly. In much the same vein, Binance’s many strategic partnerships were outlined as a potential bullish catalyst, together with positive market sentiment. Finally, GPT-4o noted that the coin’s built-in deflationary measure, a quarterly burn , serves to keep scarcity at a level that supports price growth. Bullish factors that could impact BNB prices. Source: OpenAI On the other hand, Binance’s past issues with regulatory bodies, as well as its ongoing legal dispute with FTX were mentioned as factors that could have a negative impact on investor confidence. In addition, the AI model opined that increasing market competition, as well as BNB’s dependence on Binance as a platform, could serve to suppress growth or decrease the coin’s value. Bearish factors that could impact BNB prices. Source: OpenAI ChatGPT-4o sets Binance Coin (BNB) price targets for the end of 2024 GPT-4o outlined two scenarios — one broadly bullish, and the other broadly bearish. In the first case, it predicted that BNB would reach a price of $850 by the end of the year. If that pans out, it would represent a 10.21% upside — not bad, but certainly modest when compared to the asset’s recent momentum. BNB price targets for the end of 2024. Source: OpenAI In the other case, assuming that bearish factors turn out to be more impactful, OpenAI’s model set a $700 price target. This would equate to a 9.22% downside from current BNB prices. On the whole, it should be noted that the bearish case does appear weaker. Legal disputes take years to play out and likely aren’t going to deter anyone from speculative investments. Regulatory scrutiny and market competition simply come with the territory in the crypto space — and while reliance on Binance does present an operational risk, it’s highly unlikely that this fact will ever materialize into anything. At the end of the day, BNB will most likely follow wider market trends.

37213195,https://crypto.news/?p=14316185,1733324953,4 crypto gems below $3 that could turn $300 into $30000 in just months,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Low-cap cryptos under $3, like Rexas Finance and Render Token, show potential to turn small investments into big profits. Table of Contents Rexas Finance: Leader in real-world tokenizing of assets Rendering Token: Distinctive industries decentralized Celer Network: Pioneering interoperability of blockchain Spell Token: Creative ideas in decentralized finance Why These Tokens Are Unique Conclusion Small investments in the cryptocurrency market have long been a means of yielding life-changing profits. Smaller-cap coins with great growth potential present a lot of possibilities. Knowing where to search, smart investors can find ventures ready for quick adoption and appreciation that will turn as little as $300 into a startling $30,000. Right now, under $3, Rexas Finance (RXS) , Render Token (RNDR), Celer Network (CELR), and Spell Token (SPELL) are among the most exciting tokens. These enterprises are perfect candidates for significant profits since each one of them presents special qualities and strong foundations. Rexas Finance: Leader in real-world tokenizing of assets Among the fascinating tokens available on the market now is Rexas Finance. At $0.10 in its presale Stage 8, Rexas has already raised over $20.4 million; the price will go to $0.125 in the next stage. This outstanding result emphasizes the market’s faith in Rexas Finance’s ambition of tokenizing real-world assets (RWA) and changing asset management. By allowing fractional ownership of historically illiquid assets, including real estate, gold, and art, the idea democratizes access to high-value investments and offers liquidity. Rexas Finance is transforming asset management and trade with creative tools, including the AI-powered NFT Generator for producing original digital assets, a CertiK-audited ecosystem for strong security, and the QuickMint Bot for flawless token production. Furthermore, Rexas Finance intends for Tier 1 exchange listings, which will improve liquidity and accessibility, and has exposure thanks to listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. These elements point to RXS for a meteoric climb; forecasts indicate it could reach $3 or more in the not-too-distant future. For those looking for significant profits, a modest $75 investment in RXS at its present pricing may convert into $2,250. Rendering Token: Distinctive industries decentralized Rendering Token (RNDR), valued somewhat under $2, is another treasure with great potential. RNDR is decentralizing the rendering process for 3D models, animations, and other digital assets, transforming the creative field. Using blockchain technology, RNDR lets consumers use idle GPU compute capability to handle rendering chores, drastically lowering prices and hastening project schedules. Demand for economical and quick rendering solutions is expected to rise as sectors such as gaming, virtual reality, and the metaverse continue to develop. Render Token is in a good position to profit from this movement. Investors joining at the current price could find significant gains since RNDR’s acceptance quickens and its value appreciates. You might also like: Rexas Finance poised to be future of RWA tokenization: Fourth presale stage ends earlier than predicted Celer Network: Pioneering interoperability of blockchain Priced at about $0.02, Celer Network (CELR) solves one of the main issues with the blockchain sector: interoperability. Its technology creates a single ecosystem for distributed apps (dApps), allowing flawless communication and transactions across several blockchains. Celer provides the Celer Inter-chain Messaging Framework (Celer IM) for instantaneous communication between dApps and layer-2 scaling solutions to lower costs and increase transaction speeds. Celer Network is positioned to become a vital infrastructure layer as the multi-chain ecosystem gathers traction so developers can quickly create and expand dApps. Given CELR’s present low price, early investors would benefit greatly from even a small increase to $1. A $75 investment at $0.02 may increase to $3,750, highlighting the token’s exponential possibilities. Spell Token: Creative ideas in decentralized finance Priceless at less than $0.01, Spell Token (SPELL) is the last gem on this page. Operating the distributed finance (DeFi) project, SPELL powers Magic Internet Money (MIM), a native stablecoin borrowing tool against interest-bearing assets. This creative strategy helps users optimize the value of their resources and enable returns. Focusing on cross-chain lending and other specialist markets, Spell Token has found a niche in the fast-growing DeFi scene. SPELL will ride the wave of rising interest and investment as DeFi use expands. Early investors would get a huge return from a climb to even $0.10, transforming a $75 investment into $750. Why These Tokens Are Unique Every one of these tokens presents special value propositions that fit changing market needs and correspond with significant movements in the cryptocurrency and blockchain domains. Rexas Finance answers the growing need for tokenized assets; Render Token transforms the creative industry; Celer Network works on blockchain interoperability; and Spell Token develops in the DeFi space. These tokens have the possibility of life-changing rewards and are reachable by a wide spectrum of investors thanks to their present cheap pricing points. Even if just some of these four ventures realize their full potential, a diversified investment in them might produce remarkable results. Investors can build a diverse portfolio with explosive potential by committing $75 to each token. The combined portfolio would be worth nearly $30,000—an amazing return on a $300 investment—should RXS reach $3, RNDR soar to $10, CELR hit $1, and SPELL increase to $0.10. Conclusion Investors ready to go beyond the well-known behemoths like Bitcoin and Ethereum can find plenty of prospects in the crypto industry. Combining great fundamentals with low entry prices, projects such as Rexas Finance, Render Token, Celer Network, and Spell Token reflect the next generation of high-growth assets. These four tokens stand out as the best chances available on the market today for anybody looking to grow a small investment into a transforming amount. Turning $300,000 from $300 is a possibility and a realistic target with the correct timing and a little patience. To learn more about RXS, visit the official website , Whitepaper , X and Telegram .

According to blockchain analytics platform Glassnode, the BNB Chain recently clinched 751,000 active addresses. This marks the highest level of activity observed on the network in the past eight months. Glassnode attributes the surge to rising on-chain activity and an improvement in network fundamentals, noting that active address momentum plays an important role. This metric often signals growth in network usage and adoption. However, despite the recent uptick, current active addresses remain well below the 2021 peak of approximately 1.5 million. Glassnode noted that this gap is a sign of potential for further growth in network activity and adoption. PancakeSwap’s Springboard The spike in active addresses also coincides with PancakeSwap’s launch of “Springboard,” a new protocol on the BNB Chain for token creation. Interestingly, the protocol allows users to create tokens on the network without requiring coding skills, streamlining the token creation process. PancakeSwap has emphasized that the tool is free, encouraging participation on the BNB Chain. Springboard follows the trend set by similar features on other blockchains, such as SunPump on TRON, snek.fun on Cardano and First Ledger on the XRPL. These protocols have led to an increase in address activity on their respective networks. BNB Hits ATHThe recent surge in address activity also comes at a time when Binance Coin (BNB), the native token of the BNB Chain, recently achieved a major milestone by hitting an all-time high (ATH) of $793 today.Although the token slightly retraced from this peak, now trading around $774, it still maintains a daily gain of 5.42%. Despite underperforming last month, with a meager 13% gain, BNB has begun December on a bullish note, already up 18% so far.Notably, market analyst Mando CT remains optimistic about BNB’s long-term performance. Commenting on X, he noted that BNB has consistently delivered strong results for investors over time. https://twitter.com/XMaximist/status/1864301354153332976He congratulated the Binance community on the new ATH and expressed confidence in BNB surpassing the four-digit price range, describing it as a simple and inevitable outcome.

While investors thought that the altcoin season had begun, Grayscale filed a spot Solana ETF application. While Grayscale’s SOL move has increased expectations and speculations that various altcoin ETFs will be approved, the CEO of leading exchange Bitget said that the challenges of getting altcoin spot ETFs approved continue. Speaking to Bloomberg TV, Bitget CEO Gracy Chen explained the hurdles in gaining approval for altcoin ETFs such as Solana (SOL), XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE). Stating the lack of futures ETFs as the first reason, the famous CEO emphasized that futures ETFs were approved before spot ETF approvals in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Chen said that the lack of futures ETFs for altcoins like SOL, XRP, and DOGE remains a hurdle for approval, compared to the case of BTC and ETH. The second reason is that some regulators still consider tokens like SOL to be securities, Chen said, and these discussions could negatively affect approval processes. The famous CEO finally stated that most altcoins have a decentralized structure as much as BTC and ETH, and that altcoins are relatively more susceptible to manipulation and that the risk of market manipulation is higher in altcoin ETFs compared to BTC and ETH. Bitget CEO Gracy Chen said that Bitcoin’s fluctuations near the $100,000 level are short-term and reflect a strong “arbitrage” sentiment among investors. According to the famous CEO, although cryptocurrency regulations in the US tend to be more positive, investors prefer to make profits from current prices due to the existing uncertainties. This causes the BTC price to fall. However, investors see price declines as buying opportunities as they expect more increases. This cycle among investors causes the price to fluctuate at certain levels. *This is not investment advice.

37213135,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=103923,1733324784,"Vechain Hits 2-Year High of $0.07901, as Experts Set Timeline for Potential Surge to $0.1","VeChain (VET) continues to rank among the major beneficiaries of the ongoing bull rally, as its price hits a two-year high of $0.07901. VET's price has surged by over 250% in the past 30 days, reaching a two-year high of $0.07901 in the early hours of today.The last time VET hit this target was over two years ago when its price soared to over $0.08 in April 2022. However, VET’s price plunged shortly after, leaving the token to trade below the $0.07 level for more than two years.Interestingly, VeChain finally broke the resistance today, as it surged to $0.07901. Although VET has dropped below the $0.072 mark since it achieved the milestone, the token is still up 253% over the past 30 days, 69.48% in the last week, and 6.3% in 24 hours.Reason Behind VeChain Surge It bears mentioning that VeChain’s latest price surge coincides with the recent rally witnessed among large-cap altcoins. Assets like XRP, Cardano, Tron, and Dogecoin have recorded huge gains since November. For instance, while XRP surged to $2.85 on December 1 for the first time since January 2018, Tron hit an all-time high (ATH) of $0.4407 yesterday. Although VeChain did not set a new all-time high record like Tron, its price has surged more than threefold, from $0.01937 to a monthly high of $0.07901. VeChain Loses 27th Position in Global Crypto Ranking The asset briefly flipped Cronos and POL to become the 27th-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap earlier today after it surged to $0.07901. However, following its slight correction, it has dropped back to the 29th position in the global crypto ranking. At press time, VET boasts a market cap of $5.75 billion. Furthermore, VeChain’s volume has collapsed by 14.63% over the past 24 hours to $966.85 million.Can VET Hit $0.1? Following VeChain’s recent surge, investors are closely observing whether it could hit the psychological mark of $0.1 in the near future. To do so, VET would need to soar by 40.82% from its current price of $0.07101. Data from market analytics platform Coincodex suggests that the $0.1 target for VET could become a reality by February 2025. Specifically, Coincodex expects VET to trade at an average price of $0.11 and a maximum price of $0.12 in the next three months. VeChain Price Prediction VeChain Price Prediction Furthermore, Telegaon expects VET to hit the $0.1 mark by next year, setting its minimum, average, and maximum price targets at $0.16, $0.31, and $0.54, respectively.",POSITIVE,XRP | VET,ADA | MARKET | TRADING | XRP | VET,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/04/vechain-hits-2-year-high-of-0-07901-as-experts-set-timeline-for-potential-surge-to-0-1/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=vechain-hits-2-year-high-of-0-07901-as-experts-set-timeline-for-potential-surge-to-0-1,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

This unified approach means more liquidity, less friction, and a vibrant NFT ecosystem on Sei. Amidst significant uptrends in the crypto market, the NFT developments contributed to SEI’s 13% jump to the $0.7153 daily peak. Sei price actions – a possible move past $1 SEI has presented impressive performances lately, gaining over 100% within the past month to hit levels not seen since April. Moreover, its price actions have printed an expanding channel setup on the daily chart, and SEI traded within the pattern since August. The altcoin trades at $0.7075, with a 55% surge in trading volume suggesting significant trader optimism. Source: Coinmarketcap Also, technical indicators highlight buyers in control. The Relative Strength Index at 60 shows SEI is yet to hit the overbought territory. That confirms more room for gains before potential dips. Further, its average trendline experiences a bullish convergence, opening the doors for more Sei gains this week. The 4-hour Moving Average Convergence Divergence supports the bullish narrative. The MACD line is well above the signal line, highlighting buyer dominance. The solid green histograms testify to that. Furthermore, the Chaikin Money Flow (on the 1-day timeframe) shot from 0.23 on December 1 to 0.39 at press time. Source: TradingView That shows substantial cash entering the SEI ecosystem, signaling investor confidence in the alt’s future performance. SEI price could retest the channel pattern’s resistance if the broad market retains the prevailing optimism. Further uptrends would see the altcoin soaring to its yearly peak of $0.86. That would open the path for $1 per SEI, which would mean a 41.32% increase from current prices. Contrarily, sudden selling pressure could see SEI retesting the support barrier at $0.6015. Intensified bearish sentiments would drag the token towards the lower foothold at $0.4085. Meanwhile, the current trends support bullish performances. Increased attention in sectors such as NFTs amidst bull runs suggests extended rallies for the crypto market. Also, alts have outperformed Bitcoin in the past few sessions, confirming that the crypto space might be in an altcoin season .

37213020,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=106856,1733324608,MicroStrategy Poised for Nasdaq 100 Inclusion: A Milestone for Bitcoin Exposure,"MicroStrategy Likely to Join Nasdaq 100, Solidifying Its Bitcoin Leadership MicroStrategy (Nasdaq ticker: MSTR) , renowned for its extensive Bitcoin holdings , is reportedly on track to join the Nasdaq 100 index , according to a report from CoinDesk . If included, the business intelligence firm would not only elevate its market profile but also bring significant Bitcoin exposure to one of the world’s most prestigious stock indices. With a market capitalization of $88.5 billion , MicroStrategy surpasses the threshold for inclusion in the Nasdaq 100, which requires a market cap of at least 0.1% of the total index value —currently approximately $23 trillion . What Is the Nasdaq 100? The Nasdaq 100 is an index of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. It includes tech giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla, making it a key barometer of innovation-driven sectors. Inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 is not just a milestone but also a gateway to: Greater Visibility: Companies gain exposure to a broader investor base. Index Fund Investment: Inclusion in funds like the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) ensures institutional interest. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Strategy: A Game-Changer Largest Corporate Bitcoin Holder MicroStrategy is widely recognized for its Bitcoin accumulation strategy , holding more Bitcoin than any other publicly traded company aside from Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) managers. Current Holdings: Over 158,245 BTC (as of Q3 2024). Value: These holdings are worth approximately $6.4 billion at current Bitcoin prices, constituting a significant portion of its corporate treasury. Impact on the Market The potential inclusion of MicroStrategy in the Nasdaq 100 would indirectly introduce Bitcoin exposure to the index, further legitimizing cryptocurrency as an asset class among traditional investors. Meeting the Nasdaq 100 Criteria Market Cap Requirement To qualify for the Nasdaq 100, a company’s market cap must exceed 0.1% of the total market value of the index, currently set at approximately $23 trillion . With a market cap of $88.5 billion , MicroStrategy comfortably meets this requirement. Additional Requirements Trading Volume: Companies must maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure smooth trading. Sector Representation: While primarily tech-focused, the index includes innovative firms across various industries. Implications of Nasdaq 100 Inclusion 1. Increased Institutional Investment Inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 and its tracking fund, the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) , would expose MicroStrategy to a broader range of institutional investors. Automatic Inclusion: QQQ tracks the Nasdaq 100, meaning MicroStrategy’s shares would be added to the ETF. Boosted Liquidity: Higher trading volumes and investor interest are likely outcomes. 2. Enhanced Credibility for Bitcoin As a major Bitcoin holder, MicroStrategy’s inclusion could further normalize cryptocurrency investments within traditional finance. 3. Stock Performance Boost Historically, stocks added to the Nasdaq 100 tend to experience a short-term rally due to increased demand from index funds and ETFs. The Broader Impact on the Crypto Ecosystem MicroStrategy’s possible inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 highlights the growing convergence between traditional financial markets and cryptocurrencies . Spotlight on Bitcoin: Increased visibility for Bitcoin as an asset class among mainstream investors. Market Maturity: Reflects the maturation of the cryptocurrency market and its integration into institutional portfolios. Community and Industry Reactions Optimism Among Crypto Advocates Crypto enthusiasts view MicroStrategy’s potential inclusion as a step forward for Bitcoin adoption: “This solidifies Bitcoin’s role in institutional finance.” “MicroStrategy in the Nasdaq 100? It’s a win for the crypto industry!” Skepticism From Traditional Analysts Some traditional market analysts express caution: Concerns over Bitcoin’s volatility affecting MicroStrategy’s stock. Questions about whether heavy reliance on Bitcoin aligns with traditional index criteria. What’s Next for MicroStrategy? Timeline for Nasdaq 100 Changes The Nasdaq 100 undergoes annual rebalancing, typically announced in early December and implemented later in the month. If MicroStrategy qualifies, its addition could happen as soon as the upcoming rebalancing. Strategic Implications MicroStrategy may continue expanding its Bitcoin holdings to solidify its market leadership. The company could leverage the heightened visibility to attract more institutional and retail investors. Conclusion: A Milestone for Bitcoin and Traditional Finance MicroStrategy’s potential inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 is not just a validation of its business strategy but a significant milestone for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. As the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, its addition to this elite index could pave the way for further integration of digital assets into mainstream financial markets. For investors, this development represents an opportunity to gain indirect exposure to Bitcoin through a traditional stock market vehicle, potentially setting the stage for broader crypto adoption in institutional finance.

The altcoin has had a big couple of weeks, with its price up by 80% in seven days and by 400% in 30. Some analysts now hold that XRP is in a very strong position, with ERGAG CRYPTO recently claiming that the token will never drop below $2 again. Indeed, XRP is now so far beyond $2 that it may not be long before $3 becomes its macro support, with the coin likely to pass its current ATH in the first half of next year. XRP Surges Amid Bullish Wedge Pattern – Analyst Claims It Will Never Drop ‘Below $2 Again’ The most bullish thing about XRP right now is that it has recently broken through a long-term wedge pattern, as pointed out by investor Raoul Pal a couple of days ago. You've got to admit, $XRP is a good looking chart. Last time it broke a long wedge pattern it rose another 5,600%! (obvs wont repeat but you get the point – i can go up a lot) Banana Zone Part 1 pic.twitter.com/MTs6fdJrT3 — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) December 2, 2024 As Pal notes, its last such breakout resulted in a gain of 5,600%, which would imply a price of around $34. Assuming that such a return is likely, it makes ERGAG CRYPTO’s claim of a $2 support seem very modest. #XRP – $2: The Next Macro Support? ***************************************************** Alert: This is your wake-up call! You Might Not See #XRP Below $2 Again! ****************************************************** #XRP is just 29 days away from potentially… pic.twitter.com/LU3I9fkews — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 2, 2024 Regardless, XRP has taken off in recent days for two interrelated reasons. The first is that Ripple’s legal issues with the SEC are likely over, given that Gary Gensler will step down as head of the regulator in January. This could put a halt to the SEC’s appeal against Ripple, with Donald Trump reportedly favoring the more pro-crypto Paul Atkins as Gensler’s successor . Secondly, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has already met Donald Trump , something which could be a precursor to favorable legislation and to potential business deals. As such, XRP could really explode next year, with the alt still yet to overtake its January 2018 ATH of $3.40. Looking at its one-hour chart, it looks ready to bounce back up again after correcting yesterday. Source: TradingView Its relative strength index (purple) had fallen below 50 last night, but is now climbing again in a show of momentum. At the same time, its current price has overtaken its 30-period moving average (orange), another sign that buyers are returning. And when coupled with a trading volume of $42 billion today, it’s clear that XRP still has plenty of strength. 24,999,991 #XRP (67,237,760 USD) transferred from #Binance to unknown wallet https://t.co/eREWkVBhK6 — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 3, 2024 It’s on course to reach $3 by the end of the year, and should pass its current record high of $3.40 by Q2 2025. New High-Potential Presale Coins Diversification is often key to a successful trading strategy, and while XRP certainly looks very strong right now, traders should consider allocating funds to alternatives. Not only will this help them even out periods when XRP is quiet, but it could also expose them to some very big returns, given how strongly certain new tokens can rally. One new coin with a great chance of going big next year is Crypto All-Stars (STARS), an ERC-20 coin that has raised over $8.3 million in its incredibly popular presale. Can’t Stop! Won’t Stop! There’s a party at the All-Stars house and it’s not slowing down anytime soon! 8 Million is a massive milestone and with this kind of support Crypto All-Stars is sure to go down in meme coin history! pic.twitter.com/Mw11M6F1ys — Crypto All-Stars (@all_stars_coin) December 3, 2024 The secret to Crypto All-Stars’ success so far is its ‘MemeVault’, a storage protocol in which holders of any meme token can stake their funds. Crypto All-Stars achieves this via harnessing the ERC-1155 multi-token standard, which can tokenize any cryptocurrency, including coins not running on the Ethereum blockchain. This opens up the project to a huge user base, and what’s especially bullish is that users who stake meme coins with its protocol will receive more rewards if they hold more STARS tokens. This means that STARS could attract huge demand, with holders of other tokens using it to boost their earnings. Its sale will end in 16 days, but investors can still join it by going to the official Crypto All-Stars website . STARS currently costs $0.0016715, which is its final presale price. But with a huge raise behind it and 19,000 followers on X , it could rally well beyond this price in the next few weeks.

The maiden cryptocurrency has been trading within a clear channel-up formation throughout November 2024, echoing a similar bullish pattern seen in November 2023, according to cryptocurrency trading expert TradingShot . As per the analyst, despite resistance near the psychological $100,000 level, historical movements indicate that Bitcoin could break through soon, potentially reaching $140,000 by early 2025. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView A breakdown of Bitcoin’s chart reveals striking similarities between the lows of August 2024 and August 2023, when prices briefly dipped below the 200-day moving average ( MA )—a key trend indicator. Both times, Bitcoin rebounded through a cup pattern, signaling consolidation followed by an upward breakout, often marking the start of an accumulation phase. During these periods, the one-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) showed bullish divergence, hinting at weakening downward momentum and a potential reversal. By November 2024, the bullish golden cross emerged alongside the channel-up pattern, indicating strong upward momentum and mirroring a setup that led to Bitcoin’s March 2024 highs. According to the expert, while a recent MACD death cross signalled short-term bearish momentum, historical patterns suggest such pullbacks often precede robust recoveries. After testing the 2.0 Fibonacci extension from the August 2024 lows, the fractal symmetry suggests a potential move toward the 3.0 Fibonacci level. This would target a Bitcoin price of around $140,000, possibly by February 2025. Meanwhile, an analysis shared by the charting platform TrendSpider suggests that Bitcoin’s technical setup is also building toward another record high. In an X post on December 4, the platform noted that Bitcoin is gearing up for a major move, with its daily chart flashing promising signals. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TrendSpider The cryptocurrency is consolidating within a tightening wedge pattern while holding support above the eight-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMA). The TTM Squeeze indicator has also fired, signaling a period of low volatility that often precedes a breakout. “BTC Bitcoin is starting to set up real nicely here Looks like a ticking timebomb,” the platform noted. Overall, the markets are eyeing a potential Bitcoin breakout toward the $100,000 resistance. After facing multiple rejections near the level, there remains hope the asset might target the new high in 2024. In this case, as reported by Finbold, based on historical price movements, the maiden digital asset could trade between $94,782 and $101,273 by the end of 2024.

The asset has primarily consolidated at the start of December, posting a weekly gain of about 1.4%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

37213690,https://blockworks.co/news/squid-cross-chain-liquidity-protocol,1733324327,Squid greases cross-chain liquidity,"Squid has unwrapped a decentralized intent-based liquidity protocol that promises cheaper, faster, and more efficient cross-chain swaps. The Cross-Chain Order Routing and Auction Layer (CORAL), which went live today, uses a request-for-quote (RFQ) system, enabling users to execute swaps across chains with minimal costs and near-instant finality. CORAL’s intents handle swaps natively, unlocking market maker order book pricing similar to CoWSwap. This approach eliminates slippage and ensures optimal execution by directly engaging with liquidity providers during the transaction process. “With CORAL, we’ve removed the borders between chains [to] allow liquidity to flow with minimal friction,” said Fig, Squid’s co-founder. The new protocol builds on the successful Squid 2.0 upgrade, which focused on abstracting away complex cross-chain transaction flows with multiple hops. Read more: Squid sinks its tentacles into cross-chain abstraction One interesting property of the design is that like a zk rollup , the more transactions come through, the cheaper it becomes for the end user. That’s because the architecture allows for batching intents, which “saves a significant amount of gas and delivers users the best execution possible for their swaps,” Fig said. This makes it “the cheapest decentralized intent protocol” on the market, even edging out market leaders like Across Protocol, he said. By reducing the per-order gas overhead, “as you scale, it becomes basically free.” Across Protocol uses more complex cryptographic batching processes , while CORAL leverages Axelar’s secure general message-passing protocol. Like Across, this approach pushes all bridge and routing risks to market makers, who handle the backend complexities of asset transfers. Users receive native assets on their destination chain, eliminating the need for wrapped tokens or trust in external validators. CORAL’s flexibility goes beyond swaps. It allows developers to build complex DeFi applications using pre- and post-hooks, enabling actions like depositing cross-chain-swapped assets into yield farms with one click. “I think we’re on a trajectory to have all the assets on one or two chains,” Fig said. “This tech allows you to hold native assets and not really have to bridge them.” The protocol is now live on major chains including Ethereum, Arbitrum and Base. Plans to integrate Solana, Sui and Aptos are slated for January, and Cosmos-based chains through IBC later in 2025. Also on the road map: the ability to aggregate multiple messaging protocols, such as Hyperlane, which will add support for another 40-50 EVM-compatible blockchains. These additions will create a “network of networks,” significantly enhancing interoperability. Altogether, Squid is positioned as a front-runner in achieving true chain abstraction , where users interact with assets seamlessly, regardless of their originating chains. “Cross-chain swaps are now as cheap as single-chain swaps, so we can really move toward full chain abstraction, where users don’t need to think about which chain their assets are on,” Fig said.

37213011,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622516,1733324235,"The global economy might miss its chance for growth recovery next year, says OECD","The global economy might not get the growth rebound it desperately needs in 2025, the OECD has warned. In its latest report , the organization painted a picture of a world walking on a financial tightrope. Risks are everywhere. Trade tensions are rising, public debt is climbing, and geopolitical conflicts are stirring chaos. Policymakers have their hands full trying to hold it all together. The OECD predicts global growth will hover at 3.3% annually for the next two years. On the surface, that might look stable. But beneath the headline number, cracks are forming. “Robust overall performance masks significant differences across regions and countries,” said Chief Economist Alvaro Pereira. Trade wars and fiscal headaches threaten stability The OECD report warned that the rise in protectionist policies could disrupt trade flows, push up consumer prices, and hammer economic growth. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s tariff-focused agenda hasn’t gone unnoticed. “Rising trade tensions and further moves toward protectionism might disrupt supply chains, raise consumer prices, and negatively impact growth,” the OECD said. Meanwhile, geopolitical conflicts could send energy prices soaring, adding more pressure to already fragile economies. Debt is another time bomb ticking away. The OECD said public debt among its member countries will reach 117% of GDP by 2026, a sharp rise from pre-pandemic levels. Italy and Japan, already drowning in debt, are in particularly dire straits. France isn’t far behind. The country’s government is currently battling a no-confidence vote over its fiscal plans. Even if the dissenters fail, political chaos could further slow economic recovery. “A government budget agreement that reduces policy uncertainty could quickly reassure markets. If the budget is not adopted, political uncertainty would bear down on the recovery.” Weak inflation and disappointing growth could also shrink tax revenues, making things even worse. Uneven growth across regions The growth forecast looks like a patchwork quilt — some countries are holding up, while others are falling apart. The U.S., for example, is expected to grow at 2.4% in 2025, slower than its 2.8% in 2024. Consumer spending is softening as the job market cools. But even with this slowdown, the U.S. will still outperform the rest of the G-7 economies. Germany, on the other hand, is struggling. It is projected to grow just 0.7% in 2025, the lowest among major economies. The eurozone as a whole is doing slightly better, with growth expected to reach 1.3% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026. Central bank policies and tight labor markets are helping to keep the region afloat, but the recovery is far from strong. China’s economy is slowing down too. Growth is predicted to drop from 4.9% in 2024 to 4.4% by 2026. High savings rates and a sluggish real estate sector are dragging it down. The OECD warned that “potential further credit events may disrupt the orderly adjustment process in the real estate sector.” This could create ripple effects that reach far beyond China’s borders. Japan is trying to claw its way back from a 0.3% contraction in 2024. Economic stimulus measures are expected to boost growth to 1.5% in 2025, but that momentum won’t last. By 2026, growth is forecast to shrink to 0.6%. The OECD noted that Japan is an exception among major economies, as its central bank will likely stick to its ultra-loose monetary policy. The UK is showing some signs of life. Growth is projected to rise from 0.9% in 2024 to 1.7% in 2025, thanks to real income gains and increased public spending. However, the honeymoon period won’t last long. By 2026, growth is expected to dip back to 1.3%, as higher taxes weigh on the economy. The stakes couldn’t be higher. The global economy is at a crossroads. As Pereira put it, “Policy has a key role to play at the current juncture to manage risks and to unleash the prospects for stronger, resilient, and sustainable growth.” But the clock is ticking.

Ripple’s ( XRP ) coin was trading at $2.55 Wednesday morning, within striking distance of its year-to-date high of $2.900. In an X post, Charles Hoskinson, Cardano ( ADA ) founder, said that he was “excited about RLUSD.” He tweeted that in response to a CT article describing more details about the stablecoin that launches on Dec. 4. Excited about RLUSD https://t.co/pTA8ikdeyA — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 4, 2024 His post could be a sign that Cardano may agree to have the RLUSD stablecoin launch on its blockchain. That would be significant since Cardano’s network now has just $24 million in stablecoins. A future expansion of RLUSD to the Cardano ecosystem would help it grow its stablecoin volume. RLUSD, which is backed 1:1 by the US dollar, aims to compete with other growing stablecoins like Tether and USD Coin. Tether maintains a leading market share, with a 70% dominance. USD Coin, USDS, Ethena USDe, and Dai follow it. It will initially launch on Ethereum and the XRP Ledger. You might also like: Argo Blockchain posts $3.4m mining revenue despite dip in Bitcoin output The main challenge for the RLUSD stablecoin is substantial competition. For example, PayPal’s PYUSD has accumulated just $495 million in assets, despite the big name behind it. The RLUSD launch comes at a time when the XRP price has staged a strong comeback, rising by over 400% from its lowest point this year. XRP has also jumped as investors cheer the upcoming changes at the Securities and Exchange Commission. Gary Gensler, who has battled Ripple Labs for the past four years, is expected to step down in January. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is now considering the crypto-friendly regulator, Paul Atkins as the next head of the agency . Such a move could lead to a spot XRP ETF in 2025 and more favorable regulations. XRP price analysis XRP price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the Ripple price has performed well in recent weeks. It has jumped above key levels at $1 and $2 and is now attempting to break above $3. XRP price remains above all moving averages, while oscillators like the Relative Strength Index and the MACD have moved to extreme overbought levels. Ripple is also forming a bullish pennant chart pattern, a popular bullish sign. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the XRP token will continue rising, potentially above $3. The risk, however, is that the coin could experience a brief pullback as it moves to the markdown phase of the Wyckoff Method. If this happens, it may drop to about $1.50.

It’s showing no signs of slowing down, either. Currently, $PEPU is netting over $2 million a day. Over on the officia l website , a countdown timer displays just nine days left for interested investors to buy in at a fixed presale price of $0.01295 per token before it launches on centralized and decentralized exchanges. However, word on the grapevine suggests the presale could conclude much sooner, and the token could launch on CEXs and DEXs by early next week. Given the extraordinary hype, once Pepe Unchained hits the open market, it’s likely to go to the moon. The Pepe Unchained presale launched this summer to a wave of hype as meme coin fans bundled in to take advantage of virtually unheard-of staking rewards, alongside lower fees and 100x faster speeds for anyone transacting with $PEPU than its leading ERC-20 meme coin competitors. To understand the scale of its ICO, one of the year’s biggest meme coins, Slothana, raised $15 million, which was considered a gargantuan fundraising at the time. $PEPU has netted over 4x that amount. Beyond $PEPU’s ICO, the token’s likely listing on exchanges could smash the ceiling on its potential appreciation. So, for those who still haven’t made their minds up, there may never be a better time to buy in – an investment of $100 bags 7,722 $PEPU. Read on to find out how Pepe’s new Layer 2 blockchain token rewards its holders with a glimpse into the future of meme coins. Pepe: A Classic, Unchained and Reimagined The original Pepe (ticker: $PEPE) is the third-biggest meme coin in crypto with a $8.2 billion market cap. It’s also the largest non-canine meme coin on the market. The already-famous avatar dropped four years before Bitcoin’s launch in 2009. Pepe was originally a character in the webcomic Boy’s Club , designed by Max Furie, known and memed for his catchphrase “feels good, man”. He then became a global sensation. Pepe became a political icon after appearing in the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests. Since the original $PEPE’s launch, other tokens inspired by Furie’s comic have dropped, but none enjoyed quite the same success as the original. Tokens derived from the Boy’s Club webcomic capitalize nearly a tenth of crypto’s lofty $125 billion meme coin sector. Brett coin ($BRETT)—which is on Coinbase’s proprietary Ethereum Layer 2, Base—corners $2 billion of the market, while $PEPECOIN’s market cap approaches half a billion today. Clearly, the appeal of these viral coins lies in their potential to blow sky-high. If you had bought $PEPE one year ago today, your stash would be up 1,552%. Diamond-handed $PEPECOIN hodlersHODLers are up an unbelievable 1,628% from this time last year, according to CoinGecko . $BRETT holders bought during late February’s launch are up nearly 19,735%. Given its origins as a Layer 2 meme coin, Pepe Unchained could follow a similar trajectory to Base’s Brett. However, it’s worth noting that while Coinbase backs Base, Pepe Unchained is a grassroots Layer 2 blockchain made by independent developers. INCREDIBLE! $PEPU just crossed a massive milestone! 40M!! It was only 2 days ago we celebrated 35M and there's no sign of slowing down!

Two key features in Pepe Unchained’s ecosystem expansion drive include its very own Layer 2 blockchain with a decentralized exchange (DEX) for cheap swaps between $PEPU and supported tokens, alongside a Pepe Foundation, which will help fund “an entire ecosystem with the best developers in the space contributing.” POV: Pepe’s reading his notes on the L2. Needless to say, he’s very excited for everyone to see it! pic.twitter.com/PaCBGhsWQA — Pepe Unchained (@pepe_unchained) December 3, 2024 Additionally, meme-savvy crypto fans will have known about two other features since launch: a dedicated block explorer to see all transactions on Layer 2 and a Pepe Unchained bridge for instant and low-cost bridging between Pepe Unchained and Ethereum’s Layer 1. Pepe Unchained is the first meme coin on its proprietary Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain. Ethereum is the most commercially important blockchain, thanks to a giant community of application developers and consumers who made the network the number one blockchain for decentralized finance (DeFi). However, Ethereum can currently only process about 15 transactions per second (tps), resulting in high network congestion and large transaction fees. To solve this, developers have created several Layer 2 protocols. Layer 2s sit atop the main Ethereum network and process transactions independently on a side chain before adding them to the Layer 1 blockchain ledger. Famous Layer 2s include Polygon, represented by the $POL token (formerly $MATIC), with a maximum recorded 429 tps . Layer 2 tokens have collectively amassed a market cap of over $20 billion . Pepe Unchained taps this tech to offer a meme coin that’s a hundred times quicker and cheaper to transact with than Ethereum. Pepe Unchained offers juicy rewards to $PEPU stakers, with a variable yield rate currently set at 64% APY. $PEPU Tokenomics and Further Reading A total of 3.2 billion $PEPU, or two-fifths of the total supply of 8 billion $PEPU is allocated to the presale, with a hefty 30% (2.4 billion $PEPU) going towards staking. A tenth is earmarked for the token’s marketing, while the remaining 20% is split equally between DEX liquidity and project development (both 7.5%), with the remaining 5% going into Pepe Unchained’s Layer 2 treasury. This is not a presale to miss, and interested investors have less than nine days to get in on the ground floor. Readers can learn more about Pepe Unchained by checking out the official website and whitepaper , or following the official X and Telegram accounts. The project’s smart contract is fully audited by SolidProof and $PEPU can be easily bought with ETH, USDT or bank card.

However, the Russian Parliament is considering leveraging digital currencies for cross-border trade. Due to geopolitical conflict with Ukraine and rapidly expanding Bitcoin mining operations, Deputy Energy Minister Evgeny Grabchak said the Kremlin would outlaw BTC mining in certain regions to curtail energy shortages. Russia’s plans to offer its citizens a central bank digital currency could also face delays.

37212622,https://crypto.news/?p=14316177,1733323737,"Missouri introduces bill to ban CBDCs, improve gold reserves","The Missouri Senate has introduced a bill to prohibit central bank digital currencies as legal tender while encouraging the state to hold more of its reserves in gold and silver. Known as SB 194, the legislation was filed on December 1 and is sponsored by Senator Rick Brattin. The bill aims to block public entities from accepting or participating in CBDC programs. It also mandates that the State Treasurer hold at least 1% of state funds in physical gold and silver. An exemption on capital gains taxes further incentivizes these metals. CBDCs are digital currencies issued by central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, and are designed to function as a digital version of a country’s currency. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ), which are decentralized and operate without a central authority, CBDCs are tightly controlled by governments. Critics of CBDCs cite concerns over privacy, government surveillance, and the potential erosion of state sovereignty. You might also like: French tech giant Thomson Computing launches world’s first web3 laptop Missouri’s legal definition of “money” Under SB 194, CBDCs are excluded from the legal definition of “money” in Missouri’s Uniform Commercial Code, a set of laws governing commercial transactions. Public entities would also be prohibited from participating in federal pilot programs testing CBDC systems. “The act also modifies the definition of ‘money’ for purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code to exclude central bank digital currency from its meaning,” the bill’s summary read. The bill also enhances the role of gold and silver in Missouri’s financial framework. It declares these metals as legal tender, meaning they can be used to settle debts at their market value. The legislation also exempts gains from the sale of gold and silver from state income taxes, aligning with existing exemptions on sales tax for these assets. Supporters of SB 194 argue that it is a step toward preserving financial privacy and limiting centralized control over digital transactions. The requirement to store a portion of state funds in gold and silver is intended to strengthen financial stability by relying on historically stable assets. If passed, SB 194 could position Missouri as a state prioritizing financial independence and alternatives to federally controlled digital systems.

The moving average 100 at $91,700 is supporting the price and has prevented a fall below this price once. But, will it be able to hold it again or will Bitcoin go down to $87,600? Let’s analyse the charts and other metrics to find out. Bitcoin Current Condition According to CoinMarketCap data, BTC is up by 1.36% as compared to the last 24 hours and 1.51% for the last 7 days. This is not a good sign of bullish momentum because the largest crypto fell by 7.17% last week before closing at a 0.72% down from its previous week. Bitcoin even failed to get a good upward force starting this month. This worries traders and investors. On the other hand, the cryptocurrency is also losing its daily trading volume. At the time of writing, it is down by 2.67%. After hitting a new all time high at $99,660, btc faced rejection causing it to decline to a bottom of $91,770. Being a support zone and presence of MA 100 prevented the further fall and bounced it back. However, the reduction in the strength was clearly visible as more and more doji candles started to form. Currency the price at $95,800 has support from MA 100 as well as MA 50 on a four hour chart. But will these two moving averages be able to handle the pressure, time will tell. Technical Indicators Giving Warning Following the trading volume, RSI has also fallen below 50. Currently it is at 47.04 — showing weakening of bullish power. On the other hand, the Average Directional Index also known as trend strength indicator is at level 15.57. This is a clear indication that BTC lacks power to keep up the uptrend. Let’s have a look at the liquidity heat map that can give an idea of where liquidity is present. We can see there is a huge gap between the current price and the liquidity above this price. However, there are plenty of buy orders available under this price, signaling buyers want to price to take further correction. Bitcoin quarterly returns data from Coinglass shows that BTC has given 51.04% returns to its investors in this quarter. The crypto liquidation data reveals that more long traders were liquidated in the last 24 hours. Over 161k traders lost over $405.21 million in funds. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : How to Create Crypto Tokens Without Coding: All About PancakeSwap’s SpringBoard , Looking Ahead Analysing all the technical sides it is clear that Bitcoin does not have enough strength to move towards $100k which everyone is waiting for a long time. It will have to wait until new liquidy enters the market and until then it might have to move in a consolidation zone. If the selling pressure rises due to the holiday season as traders take out profit, we might see a price drop. With large institutions supporting Bitcoin, we might see some big buyings that can push the price up.

Bitcoin remains a neutral actor in global finance, despite the U.S. dollar being used to sideline some nations. The United States has been moving towards the adoption of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve to fight its ballooning national debt of more than $36 trillion. On the other hand, the BRICS movement has gradually adopted Bitcoin to accelerate the ongoing de-dollarization. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Donald Trump’s Crypto Policy: Top Names to Watch for CFTC Chair , Furthermore, several Chinese companies have already added Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset following the approval of spot BTC ETFs in Hong Kong earlier this year.

37212416,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373386,1733323374,Here’s Alex Mashinsky’s Maximum Prison Sentence After Pleading Guilty to Fraud Charges,"Alex Mashinsky, the former CEO of cryptocurrency lender Celsius, has pleaded guilty to one count of commodities fraud and one count of securities fraud. Together, these charges carry a maximum prison sentence of 30 years. Mashinsky’s Guilty Plea Mashinsky was initially indicted in July 2023 on seven charges, including fraud, conspiracy, and market manipulation related to Celsius’ token, CEL. During a Tuesday hearing before U.S. District Judge John Koeltl, he admitted to making false claims about Celsius’s “Earn” program. The program misled investors into transferring their Bitcoin to the platform, earning him an estimated $48 million in profit. “I said that Celsius had approval from regulators,” said Mashinsky, according to an Inner City Press report . “It was false. I falsely said I was not selling my CEL tokens. I accept full responsibility for my actions.” According to court documents , the former executive has agreed to forfeit the proceeds from his illegal schemes. Judge Koeltl is scheduled to sentence him on April 8, 2025. Federal prosecutors have accused the 59-year-old of luring retail investors into Celsius by promising high returns while secretly manipulating the market to inflate the price of the company’s native CEL token. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams described his actions as “one of the biggest frauds in the crypto industry,” highlighting how he exploited catchy slogans like “Unbank Yourself” to attract billions in investments. Fraudulent Practices Behind Celsius’ Collapse Celsius, a crypto lending platform, offered services like earning rewards on crypto deposits, taking loans secured by crypto, and custodying assets. The primary offering was the “Earn” program, which promised high returns by investing users’ crypto. Under Mashinsky, the firm misrepresented its offerings’ safety, profitability, and sustainability to attract retail customers. The 59-year-old and other executives manipulated the market to inflate the value of CEL. Court documents show that he and former chief revenue officer Roni Cohen-Pavon spent millions of dollars using customer deposits to support CEL’s price artificially, misleading investors about its true value. Mashinsky personally profited by selling $48 million worth of CEL at inflated prices while falsely claiming he wasn’t selling. Before the platform halted withdrawals on June 12, 2022, he had withdrawn $8 million worth of crypto assets. The pause left customers unable to access $4.7 billion in crypto, and by July 13, 2022, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The former CEO’s guilty plea follows that of Roni Cohen-Pavon, who also admitted guilt in September 2023. Cohen-Pavon admitted to four charges, including involvement in inflating the price of CEL. He agreed to cooperate with officials in their investigations and is scheduled for sentencing on December 11.

37212511,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622544,1733323069,2024’s top performing layer 1 networks: CoinGecko report,"Blockchain analytics and crypto price tracking platform Coingecko has released an insight into the performance of Layer 1 (L1) tokens. According to the analysis, L1 tokens have soared by over 7,000% since January, driven by “renewed enthusiasm” in the crypto market post-US elections. The report highlights how 2024 saw meteoric rises, sharp declines, and mixed performances for newly launched coins. Crypto investors have witnessed the surge of several tokens, with digital assets like Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) experiencing price rises of over 5000%. Financial analysts believe the cryptocurrency’s recent market bull run was spurred by Donald Trump’s presidential election victory, who vowed to embrace and bolster the use of crypto when he takes office. Coingecko’s market analysis shows L1 tokens also followed the price rise trend, highlighting how the demand for L1 blockchains surged as platforms for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts grew in popularity among developers. Layer 1 Mantra, AIOZ, SUI among top-performing coins According to Coingecko’s research, Mantra (OM) led the L1 token price surge with a staggering 7,035.2% year-to-date (YTD) surge. OM’s success is largely attributed to its partnership with UAE-based Zand Digital Bank, aimed at enabling tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) under Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) framework. At the time of writing, Mantra is trading at $3.8, which represents a 4% increase in the last 24 hours, and a 15,830% rise from its YTD value. Source: CoinGecko report AIOZ Network (AIOZ) wasn’t far behind, posting a 427.6% YTD gain thanks to the growing adoption of its decentralized content delivery network. Sui (SUI) secured its spot in the top three with a 388.2% increase. Bellscoin (BELLS), Zano (ZANO), and Toncoin (TON) were also listed in the report among the top performers, respectively. The year’s biggest declines On the flip side, Coingecko revealed that several Layer 1 coins faced crushing losses. Entangle (NGL) plummeted by 95.3%, a steep drop attributed to its overvalued launch in March. Kujira (KUJI) and Trias Lab (TRIAS) followed with declines of 86.7% and 83.4%, respectively. Similar to what the non-fungible token market experienced in 2024, newly launched L1 tokens saw a downward price trend. Coins like Aleo (ALEO) plummeted from their YTD prices by 58.1%, while Saga (SAGA) went down by 69.9%. However, Kaia (KAIA) was a rare bright spot, recording a modest 5.2% gain since its October debut. Analysts from CryptoQuant emphasized the fierce rivalry within the Layer-1 blockchain sector, noting that many newly launched Layer-1 projects in 2024 faced substantial setbacks. Established Layer-1 protocols continue to leverage their entrenched market positions, but the rapid growth of Layer-2 solutions is raising the bar, making it harder for emerging protocols to carve out a foothold. Moderate gains for market giants While mid- and small-cap Layer 1s gave the biggest talking points of the year, larger market-cap coins still delivered respectable returns. Bitcoin (BTC) gained 128.8% YTD, outpacing traditional market indices like the S&P 500, which rose 24.8%. Ethereum (ETH), despite its modest 64.6% increase, continued to face challenges from Layer 2s and newer blockchains. According to Coingecko data, ETH is currently changing hands at $3,700, representing a price increase of just over 3% in 24 hours and over 50% in the last month. Solana (SOL) bounced back strongly from its FTX-related slump, posting a 278.3% YTD rise, while Binance Coin (BNB) gained 235% within the same period.

Recent transactions revealed the minting of nearly 10 million RLUSD tokens on the XRPL. These developments come as Ripple nears a potential approval in New York, which marks a significant milestone for its blockchain-based payment network. RLUSD To Launch On Dec 4 According to Fox Business , Ripple is expected to launch RLUSD on Dec. 4, following approval by the New York Department of Financial Services. With the crypto community anticipating the launch, the blockchain platform has warned users not to associate with any tokens claiming to be RLUSD until an official announcement is made. Moreover, a recent X post from Tron founder Justin Sun has further increased the anticipation of the forthcoming stablecoin. When $XRP RLUSD on Tron $TRX — H.E. Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) December 4, 2024 Will RLUSD Release Help TRX Reclaim Its Status? Previously, Tron (TRX) had surprisingly lost its status as the largest blockchain by the number of USDT stablecoins issued. After about 2.5 years of dominance, it was overthrown by Ethereum (ETH). Hopefully, the potential RLUSD release would help Tron (TRX) reclaim its status as the preferred blockchain for stablecoins. Notably, TRX set a new all-time high today. In 24 hours, its price added over 80%. The potential approval comes when Ripple also sees a surge in XRP prices. XRP has risen over 3% in the past 24 hours, trading at $2.56. This increase in value reflects broader optimism about Ripple’s long-term prospects and its growing role in the blockchain space. Ripple Aims To Reach Wider Audience Notably, Ripple’s stablecoin testing across two major blockchains signals its intent to enhance liquidity and interoperability. By leveraging the XRP Ledger and Ethereum, Ripple seeks to reach a wider audience and expand its use case in cross-border payments. Once RLUSD is available, Ripple plans to use both RLUSD and XRP in its cross-border payments solution to serve its global customers, the company said in RLUSD’s beta testing announcement. According to Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse, RLUSD will focus more on large institutional players.",POSITIVE,ETH | TRX | XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | TRX | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/rlusd-launch-justin-sun-hints-at-ripples-stablecoin-launch-on-tron/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Toronado Cash is a cryptocurrency mixer that allows users to obfuscate the source of crypto by pooling and shuffling all the digital assets that it received from many users together. In 2022, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions on the anonymized software tool provider in accordance with the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. OFAC also accused Tornado Cash of helping launder more than $7 billion, including over $455 million stolen by the North Korean government-backed hacking group Lazarus, and subsequently blacklisted the platform. But the U.S. Circuit Judge Don Willett, who was appointed by Republican President-elect Donald Trump during his first term, said since the crypto mixer’s smart contracts are “immutable,” meaning they can’t be changed or controlled by anyone, they simply do not legally qualify as property that can be sanctioned under existing law. Now that Tornado Cash has won the lawsuit challenging the sanctions, for which it had the financial backing of the major US crypto exchange Coinbase, US citizens will be able to use this privacy-protecting protocol. Hailing the court ruling as “a historic win for crypto and all who cares about defending liberty,” said Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase, in a post on X (previously Twitter), adding, “The government’s overreach will not stand.” ( Image Source ) This is a big moment for crypto, which has significant implications for the entire sector as it prevents truly decentralized protocols from legal liability, as under the current law, the OFAC can’t sanction the underlying code itself. However, with the court acknowledging the “the real-world downsides of certain uncontrollable technology falling outside” of the scope of authority and leaving the door open for Congress to update the law for the modern technology age, the crypto industry needs to do a better job at preserving privacy rights while preventing illicit use. Still, as SilentSwap said in a post, “Tornado Cash’s victory is a win for privacy and decentralization.” SilentSwap is a cross-chain aggregator that, instead of collecting and shuffling the funds around as a mixer does, takes a different approach to privacy, which ensures the user is always in control. Being a non-custodial platform, privacy at SilentSwap “isn’t just protected here, it’s redefined.” SilentSwap Launching a Game-Changer in Crypto SilentSwap is a privacy-focused cross-chain aggregator that allows anyone to swap in complete silence and with confidence. Powered by SecretNetwork, the DEX takes a different approach by making privacy the default. Most blockchains are open books—anyone can see every transaction and smart contract interaction. SecretNetwork uses TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) technology to ensure users have privacy, where it matters the most, while the underlying ledger stays transparent and auditable. Having such a powerful foundation enables SilentSwap to offer an unparalleled experience to crypto users that promises effortless privacy. ( Image Source ) The DEX aggregator, which is currently in public beta, is preparing for its big upcoming launch next week. Highly anticipated by the community, SilentSwap has been capturing a lot of attention well ahead of its official launch, with the platform receiving tens of thousands of early access submissions. All this demand has the team now rolling out access to everyone. Right from the beginning, SilentSwap will support swaps across eight different major blockchains, allowing users to send to 16 wallets simultaneously in a single transaction for increased accessibility. To get started on this fully decentralized and private DEX, one doesn’t need to create an account; rather, one can just connect to one's wallet and start swapping. Its infrastructure is further optimized for speed. By processing transactions faster than many existing tools in the DeFi space, SilentSwap enables its users to execute sophisticated strategies and take advantage of crypto’s high volatility. In addition to fast speed, this DEX also reduces overall fees for the user through advanced arbitrage optimization, which finds the best possible route for each trade and returns savings directly to users. This way, SilentSwap offers traders strategic protection across multiple chains, allowing them to protect their moves and prevent others from tracking and copying them. For organizations, this ability to keep transactions confidential means they can securely handle vendor payments and employee payroll. With a security layer comparable to Web2, businesses can keep their details protected from competitors and operate with a high level of discretion. Meanwhile, a regular user can maintain confidentiality over their transaction history, enjoying personal financial privacy and enhanced control that allows for secure transactions without sacrificing the functionality of DeFi. Overall, all ""vanilla DeFi"" is going to ZERO as soon as SilentSwap launches private swaps. SilentSwap is the DeFi Killer dApp. Moreover, whales and institutions demand private swaps—they’ve outgrown ""vanilla DeFi."" So, swim with the whales. Trade like a whale. Now is the time to get in early. The new political guard is bullish on DeFi. With privacy no longer held back by past limitations, the Privacy Tech Supercycle has begun!

Ethereum eyes new ATH after outperforming Bitcoin, as Polygon surges and Rollblock’s presale hints at explosive potential. Table of Contents Rollblock poised for explosive growth as savvy investors jump on its presale Ethereum ATH: ETH surges toward 2021 highs POL rises from the shadows, poised for a bullish breakout Watch out for Rollblock Analysts predict a new Ethereum (ETH) ATH on the horizon, following the token’s impressive performance over the past week, which saw it outperform even Bitcoin . As ETH targets new highs, Polygon (POL) has also been performing exceptionally well on the trading charts. Similarly, Rollblock’s presale is garnering substantial interest, hinting at the possibility of its native token becoming the next crypto to explode. Let’s explore why someone should capitalize on these investment opportunities!

This is because the online casino accepts cryptocurrencies and offers thousands of games that players can play and earn from. While RBLK serves as the key to accessing all the games on the platform, Rollblock also appeals to less crypto-inclined investors. The platform’s user-friendly interface makes it easy to navigate for players who are newbies in the crypto space, easing them into the process of staking and playing games using crypto. Another standout feature of Rollblock is its revenue-sharing model. Token holders are rewarded for staking their RBLK by receiving a share of the platform’s revenue on a weekly basis. This creates a long-term engagement opportunity, allowing users to earn passive income as the platform thrives. Ethereum ATH: ETH surges toward 2021 highs Ethereum experienced a strong turnaround during the past week, attracting $634 million in inflows in its ETFs, which boosted its year-to-date inflow to $2.2 billion. This has not only boosted 2024’s ETH ETF inflows above the inflows of 2021 but is also propelling ETH toward its price highs of 2021. Currently, ETH is trading 25% Below its ATH. While the ETH technical indicators are showing mixed signals, they lean toward a bullish outlook. Analysts predict that the price of ETH will likely consolidate before rising to $ 3,751.06 by the weekend. After reaching this level, a retracement is expected, but its next action will determine if it will retest its 2021 ATH or not.

In the last seven days alone, POL has risen by 29.8% while its trading volume surged significantly by 107.73% as investors rushed back into its market. Currently, POL is trading around the $0.71 price level, having witnessed 15 green days in the last 30. According to the price prediction by top analysts, POL is poised for a bullish breakout alongside Rollblock in a couple of weeks. The POL price is speculated to rise to $0.87 as bullish sentiment continues to grow among investors. Watch out for Rollblock While ETH and POL are currently performing impressively, experts predict that Rollblock could likely be the next crypto to explode.

37211708,https://crypto.news/?p=14315395,1733321974,Polygon-powered web3 video game Chainers unveils dates for closed playtest,"Free-to-play web3 video game Chainers announced a closed playtest for its multiplayer shooter, offering rewards in NFTs and CFB tokens. Chainers.io , which claims to have over 25 million NFTs distributed and a community of more than 350,000 players, aims to tap into web3 gaming momentum by offering a blockchain-based gaming experience that combines familiar mechanics with tokenized rewards. The free-to-play Minecraft-style MMORPG web3 video game , with its own sidechain powered by Polygon , has announced a closed playtest for its upcoming multiplayer shooter mode, dubbed “Chainers Arena Playtest.” The playtest, which will run from Dec. 5-6, will offer a select group of players the chance to test out the game’s multiplayer shooter, provide feedback, and earn rewards in non-fungible tokens or CFB tokens. The Chainers Arena is the first multiplayer shooter within the Chainers ecosystem, combining blockchain technology with familiar gameplay mechanics. The announcement marks the game’s latest step in the developers’ effort to merge traditional gaming experiences with web3 rewards. https://twitter.com/ChainersGame/status/1862536518017106226 The closed playtest aims to showcase the game’s multiplayer shooter mode, Chainers Arena, which introduces tactical gameplay elements designed to engage both competitive gamers and blockchain enthusiasts. Simultaneously, the developers claim the broader Chainers universe features interconnected gameplay elements . As such, achievements earned in the Chainers Arena shooter can influence other parts of the game, such as NFT Farm, where players cultivate plants that generate FRI, a non-exchangeable in-game token. You might also like: Nansen: GameFi market set for $301.5b surge amid ecosystem expansion According to the developers, resources produced in NFT Farm will soon be usable to enhance performance in shooter mode, creating a symbiotic relationship between all the games within the Chainers web3 universe. Similarly, rewards earned in Chainers Arena can improve farming capabilities, further integrating the two game modes. “In future resources crafted on the NFT Farm can power your performance in the shooter, while rewards earned in Arena battles can improve your farming setup. This synergy adds depth and strategy, allowing players to explore various gameplay styles while remaining part of a cohesive universe.” Chainers It’s understood that players will eventually have the ability to customize their characters, purchase exclusive NFTs, and engage in various in-game challenges and competitions. The developers note that Chainers Arena shooter mode is the first multiplayer combat experience within the Chainers ecosystem, adding further that the mode brings a “layer of tactical gameplay,” making Arena not just a game, but a “thrilling competitive space where strategy and action collide.” Moreover, developers also reward players with Polygon ( POL ) tokens for completing in-game events in the NFT Farm, which can also be withdrawn to self-custodial wallets. “Instead of focusing purely on earnings, Chainers offers a dynamic Web 3 world with enjoyable P2E mechanics. The economy of Chainers is crafted around in-game tokens like FRI and CFB, which players can earn through tasks, challenges, and completing simple tasks.” Chainers Chainers aligns itself with the expanding web3 gaming industry, which the developers expect to grow significantly over the next several years. According to their projections, the market is set to rise “from $140.7 billion in 2024 to $226 billion by 2031.” The growth is expected to be fueled by advancements in technologies such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and cross-platform gaming, the developers say. To join the playtest, users need to sign up through the Chainers.io registration form, after which selected participants will gain access to the game and be encouraged to provide feedback to help improve it. Participants will be rewarded with an exclusive “Dummy” character skin for “valuable feedback” and can earn 400 CFB tokens based on their activity. The Chainers universe is set to expand in 2024 and beyond, with future updates promising new resources, crafting systems, and multiplayer functionalities. Following the playtest, the developers plan to continue refining Chainers Arena, with an official launch set for a later date.

37211659,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622515,1733321729,"PancakeSwap introduces SpringBoard, its own meme token launch platform","PancakeSwap, the main decentralized exchange on Binance Smart Chain, will launch its own meme token launchpad, SpringBoard. Memes are already present on Binance Smart Chain, but the new platform will offer a code-free experience similar to Pump.fun. Until recently, PancakeSwap was a tool to bootstrap new tokens, and Binance Smart Chain was used for multiple high-profile memes. Now, PancakeSwap will carry its native platform for meme tokens, following the model of Pump.fun. The new platform, however, will allow anyone to create tokens without any coding experience. The new tool will be called PancakeSwap SpringBoard and will feature zero-fee tokens. The platform will use the CAKE token for building liquidity pairs. 1/5🐰Introducing PancakeSwap SpringBoard: The all-in-one platform to create and launch your project’s token on @bnbchain PancakeSwap ⚡No Coding 💸Zero Launch Fee 🔗Multi-Token Pairings 🧑‍🌾Boost Liquidity with CAKE 👉Create now https://t.co/GTZ2heWbzy 📚More… pic.twitter.com/pmuBcO3xde — PancakeSwap (@PancakeSwap) December 4, 2024 The platform already has 10 tokens with liquidity in BNB tokens since it launched. The meme platform was created just as BNB Coin (BNB) began trading at a new all-time high above $780. BNB even flipped Solana to become one of the top 5 tokens based on market capitalization. SpringBoard has an early leader, with Cava token already accruing $116K in market capitalization. The token appreciated by more than 362K%. Other new assets on the platform saw similar rapid expansions. SpringBoard follows the Pump.fun zero-fee model SpringBoard will copy Pump.fun’s model. Each token will be generated for free and will trade in the bonding curve stage. Once the required liquidity is deposited, the pair will move to PancakeSwap. In addition to CAKE, token creators will be able to raise liquidity in BNB or USDT. The only payment will be the seeding fee, which will accrue based on a token’s available liquidity. Once a meme token graduates to the PancakeSwap DEX, a 2% fee on the liquidity will be levied, leaving 50% of the fee for SpringBoard. Tokens graduate to PancakeSwap after they appreciate to 24 BNB. Unlike previous launch platforms, PancakeSwap will not market or endorse the new meme tokens. Launch limitations apply to persons based in the USA and mainland China. Previously, PancakeSwap helped raise liquidity through IDO or direct liquidity farming, also giving exposure to tokenized products. All tokens on SpringBoard must have a supply between 1M, a default of 1B tokens, and no upper limit to their supply. The bonding curve must raise a minimum of $2,000. Before graduating to PancakeSwap, new tokens will trade through the bonding curve, with a 0.001 BNB trading fee. The new assets will come with a warning of extreme risk and volatility, including rug pulls. SpringBoard will go beyond memes, allowing the creation of community projects and even DeFi tokens. The platform’s main feature is the liquidity setup tools, using the native CAKE token. CAKE is currently trading at $4.08, still 90% away from its 2021 peak above $40. The token has recovered some of its positions in 2024, but still trades near its lower range. CAKE demand for new liquidity pairs may boost demand for the asset. Binance Smart Chain is a hub of DeFi activity Binance Smart Chain is already the third-largest network for memes, competing heavily with Base. The chain carries one of the top meme assets , Simon’s Cat (CAT), in addition to versions of Ethereum and Solana memes. The announcement of a new meme launchpad arrives after even XRPL tried out user-created tokens, though at much lower liquidity levels. In the case of SpringBoard, the tokens have much higher liquidity from the start, as Binance Smart Chain users are skilled in token trading and sniping. For now, the new batch of BSC meme tokens do not have a specific brand, or high-profile memes, as the first users are testing out the platform. PancakeSwap is currently expanding its activity, almost catching up with Raydium in terms of value locked. The DEX carries $2.1B in liquidity pairs, while Raydium has $2.31B. However, for PancakeSwap, those liquidity levels represent a baseline of organic growth, while Raydium has yet to consolidate its new meme token activity. PancakeSwap has also served as a DeFi hub. It has also accrued a lot of liquid trading pairs which it will add to the new batch of volatile meme assets. Currently, PancakeSwap predominantly carries CAKE and BNB trading pairs, making up 50% of the volumes. An inflow of new tokens may add to the list of hundreds of legacy projects and memes created until now.

Notably, other such existing platforms charge users certain amounts to launch their tokens.For instance, Cardano’s Snek.fun charges 25 ADA for token creation, while Tron’s Sunpump requires a payment of around 20 TRX to launch a token. Meanwhile, Pump.fun recently shifted its launch fee to first buyers and even offers a 0.50 SOL reward for users who launch meme coins through the platform.Notably, PancakeSwap’s free deployment antics would deepen the competition in the sector. The PancakeSwap Springboard also offers users multi-token pairings and liquidity boosts with CAKE.No Coding, Automatic Liquidity Pool IntegrationFurthermore, PancakeSwap mentioned that launching a token through the protocol does not require coding experience. The deployer is only required to choose the token name and ticker to create one on the platform.The decentralized exchange also teased automatically adding the created token to a liquidity pool when it hits the required liquidity on the bonding curve. Following the launch, PancakeSwap will list the token on its DEX, allowing easy trading.Meanwhile, the Springboard protocol is the first of its kind on the BNB Chain.

37211152,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656642,1733320858,XRP Under The Microscope: Will It Break $2.9? Key Support Levels And Future Targets,"XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has recently outperformed the top ten cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). This significant momentum comes as investor sentiment grows in anticipation of clearer regulatory frameworks in the United States, especially following Donald Trump’s election. In addition, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler recently announced his departure effective January 20, which many believe could pave the way for increased adoption and institutional investment in XRP. This could be achieved through the XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, which is being pursued by asset managers such as Canary Capital, Bitwise, WisdomThree, and 21Shares. With the change in leadership at the agency, the odds of approval continue to rise, especially as the pro-crypto nominee to replace Gensler, Paul Atkins, is shaping up to lead the new era of regulation in the country. Key Fibonacci Resistance Ahead For XRP Over the past thirty days, XRP has experienced a remarkable surge of 400%, culminating in a six-year high of $2.91 reached over the past weekend. This surge has been further supported by a substantial increase in market capitalization, which has risen by $120 billion in the last three weeks, bringing XRP’s total market cap to approximately $140 billion. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price At $1.3-$1.5 Is Still Possible, Here’s Why Despite these encouraging trends, crypto analyst DarkDefender has emphasized the importance of monitoring specific price levels in the coming days. In a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), he detailed critical Fibonacci levels for XRP. The analyst identified $2.92 as a significant Fibonacci resistance level, noting that XRP briefly reached $2.90 before experiencing a “normal corrective phase.” DarkDefender highlighted the necessity of holding certain support levels, particularly $2.13 and $1.88, if XRP cannot break through the $2.92 resistance. The analyst expects that the token could bounce between these levels for a “few days,” but if the token breaks above $2.92, it could target a new mid-range level of $3.99. This would mean a new all-time high for the token above its current record mark of $3.40, in the scenario that the token rises 59% as expected by DarkDefender. Trading Volume Surges Past Bitcoin And Ethereum Adding to the positive outlook, financial analyst Jacob King pointed out a historic milestone for XRP: during the current uptrend, XRP’s trading volume has surpassed the combined volumes of Bitcoin and Ethereum for the first time. Related Reading: Cardano Next In Line After XRP? ADA Price Targets $4.88 In Epic Breakout Over the past 24 hours, XRP’s trading volume reached an impressive $2.19 billion, significantly higher than Bitcoin’s $1.6 billion and Ethereum’s $531 million, underscoring the heightened interest from investors in the XRP token. At the time of writing, the market’s third largest token trades at $2.50, recording a 7% correction in the 24 hour time frame.

37211117,https://finbold.com/?p=216758,1733320800,"Backed, Sonic, and Chainlink team up to tokenize Fortlake’s Sigma Opportunities Fund","Backed, an asset tokenization platform, has teamed up with Sonic, an Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible (EVM) blockchain , and Chainlink ( LINK ), an on-chain finance platform, to tokenize Fortlake’s Sigma Opportunities Fund, ccording to reports shared with Finbold on Wednesday, December 4. Given the strong market position of each partner, the collaboration is expected to play an important role in bringing traditional finance (TradFi) assets to the blockchain. Tokenizing the Sigma Opportunities Fund As part of the partnership, Backed will tokenize the Sigma Opportunities Fund by creating permissionless tokens, each collateralized 1:1 by fund units. Token prices will track the fund’s Net Asset Value (NAV) in real time to make them fully compatible with Sonic’s decentralized finance ( DeFi ) ecosystem. On the other hand, Chainlink’s SmartData solutions will ensure NAV data flows seamlessly on-chain while its Proof of Reserves and CCIP solutions verify collateral and assets under management and streamline cross-chain operations, respectively. Fortlake itself will manage the Sigma Opportunities Fund, targeting returns of 7–10% above the federal funds rate. By capitalizing on market inefficiencies, the fund delivered a 10% return over the past year. Why is Fortlake partnering with Sonic? Sonic offers 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) with one-second finality, and its focus on scalability in real-world asset tokenization makes it a solid choice for Fortlake as it continues to work on simplifying back-office operations. Adam Levi, Co-Founder of Backed, commented on the team’s commitment to developing new asset management solutions: “Tokenizing the Fortlake Sigma Fund is a major step forward in the blockchain landscape. It showcases how institutions can use blockchain technology to simplify back-office operations and reach new capital. This partnership reflects our commitment to transforming how financial assets are managed and traded.” — Adam Levi Colin Cunningham, Head of Tokenization & Alliances at Chainlink Labs, also expressed hopes that Chainlink’s technology can help improve the liquidity of Fortlake’s fund. Finally, Sam Harcourt, Business Development Lead at Sonic, emphasized Sonic’s broader vision for future endeavours in DeFi: “This is just the beginning. Sonic aims to bring its advanced technology to financial institutions worldwide.” — Sam Harcourt Innovative tokenization solutions The new initiative is the first of its kind for Backed as a Tokenization-as-a-Service (TaaS) platform. With innovative tokenization solutions, Backed seeks to create more opportunities for financial institutions and make blockchain more prominent in traditional finance, especially now that BlackRock is entering the market and the Bank of America is forecasting a $16 trillion market in the next ten years. Early experiments by the likes of Hong Kong Monetary Authority and JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) also highlight blockchain’s potential in asset management. All that considered, the partnership between Backed, Sonic, and Chainlink exemplifies how blockchain innovation is paving the way for a more efficient financial system.

37211129,https://coinpaper.com/6378/paul-atkins-uncertain-about-taking-role-as-trump-s-sec-chair,1733320792,Paul Atkins Uncertain About Taking Role as Trump’s SEC Chair,"Some of the other contenders for the SEC Chain position include crypto attorney Teresa Goody Guillén, former CFTC Chair Heath Tarbert, and ex-Comptroller Brian Brooks. The Reserve Rights (RSR) token surged due to the speculation of Atkins' nomination, despite his limited current involvement with the project. Meanwhile, Jorge Tenreiro, who is known for his involvement in many high-profile crypto cases, has been promoted to SEC Chief Litigation Counsel. Paul Atkins Hesitant to Step In as SEC Chair Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner and founder of Patomak Global Partners, is reportedly the leading candidate for SEC Chair under President-elect Donald Trump. However, insiders suggest that Atkins may be reluctant to take on the role because of the extensive work required to overhaul the agency after what he perceives as mismanagement by outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Despite support from people like former CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo, Atkins is hesitant to leave his consulting firm, which specializes in regulatory compliance and includes crypto clients as part of its portfolio. His decision may hinge on the readiness of his firm to operate without him. Other candidates are also under consideration. Crypto attorney Teresa Goody Guillén received a lot of support from industry leaders like Binance’s Changpeng Zhao and Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson, and is seen as a strong contender due to her pro-crypto stance and experience in SEC-related cases. Brian Brooks , a former acting Comptroller of the Currency, was previously a favorite among Web3 advocates but faces some challenges because of his limited experience in securities law. Circle’s Heath Tarbert , a former CFTC Chair, is also in the mix, along with traditional securities lawyers like Brad Bondi and Norm Champ. However, their lack of strong ties to the crypto community could pose a problem for them. Controversy surrounds some other potential picks, like Robert Stebbins and Dalia Blass. Both faced criticism for their roles in the SEC’s aggressive enforcement actions against crypto companies, including the Ripple case. The crypto community is also concerned over candidates with similar regulatory philosophies to Gensler, and seem to prefer people who may adopt a more crypto-friendly approach. If the Senate does not confirm a new chair by Jan. 20, Republican SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda could serve as acting chair. Commissioner Hester Pierce, who has been a very vocal advocate for crypto innovation, reportedly declined interest in the role. To make things even more interesting, the Trump administration preference for a lighter regulatory touch could shift oversight of the digital assets market to the CFTC. The SEC will also need to fill a vacant commissioner seat. Kalshi Puts Paul Atkins at 93% Odds for Trump’s SEC Chair Reports from various outlets suggested differing probabilities of Paul Atkins taking over the SEC Chair position. Prediction platform Kalshi recently placed Atkins’ odds of nomination at 93% before dropping slightly below 90%. Despite these high odds, Trump has not officially announced his choice yet. Atkins reportedly met with Trump’s team after an invitation to interview for the role, according to Politico . Trump’s announcements for his administration are typically made on Truth Social, but no confirmation has been issued regarding the SEC chair. If selected, Atkins will still require formal nomination in January and confirmation by a narrowly Republican-controlled Senate. Trump’s campaign promises included replacing current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who will step down on Inauguration Day. Gensler’s tenure has been very controversial in the crypto industry, and critics accused the SEC of inconsistent enforcement and regulatory overreach. The new chair will have the authority to shape policies affecting digital assets, which is a very critical issue for an industry calling for clearer regulations to prevent businesses from relocating overseas. RSR Token Rallies on Paul Atliks SEC Rumors The Reserve Rights (RSR) token saw an impressive price surge due to the speculation surrounding incoming President Donald Trump’s anticipated nomination of a new SEC Chair. Rumors within the cryptocurrency community suggested a potential link between the token's rally and the possibility of Trump appointing Paul Atkins, who previously served as an advisor to the Reserve Rights Foundation, the organization behind RSR. After Atkins emerged as a leading candidate for SEC Chair, Reserve co-creator and CEO Nevin Freeman clarified that Atkins is no longer actively consulting on the project. Freeman stated that Atkins advised Reserve during its early stages and admires his open-mindedness toward crypto. He also pointed out that Atkins has been very transparent with regards to his advisory role with Reserve. Atkins’ status as the frontrunner for the SEC role was a major contributing factor to RSR’s price rally. On Dec. 3, the token surged by up to 88%, and was even able to reach a multi-year high of $0.017, according to data from CoinMarketCap . RSR’s price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Despite this impressive recovery, RSR’s price is still way below its all-time high of $0.11 that was recorded in April of 2021. Its price still requires a 500+% increase to revisit that peak. Jorge Tenreiro Named SEC Chief Litigation Counsel Jorge Tenreiro , the acting chief of the U.S. SEC crypto and cyber unit, stepped into the role of the agency’s chief litigation counsel just weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Tenreiro’s promotion places him in charge of overseeing the SEC’s Division of Enforcement lawsuits and investigations. This position offers Tenreiro a salary of up to $305,000 annually. Tenreiro took over from Olivia Choe, who left the SEC in July for a partner role at Milbank LLP. His tenure as chief litigation counsel begins at a critical time, as Trump pledged to reduce regulatory scrutiny of the crypto industry. Before his promotion, Tenreiro served as deputy chief of the crypto assets and cyber unit since October of 2022 and later became its acting chief in June after he left David Hirsch. During his time with the crypto unit, Tenreiro played a central role in several high-profile SEC lawsuits against major crypto firms, including Kraken, Coinbase, and Ripple Labs. He was also involved in cases against Tron founder Justin Sun and in the SEC’s legal battles against FTX, which secured the agency’s largest-ever settlement of $4.47 billion with Terraform Labs and its CEO, Do Kwon, in June. However, his tenure has not been without controversy. The SEC faced sanctions for allegedly misleading a court in its case against Debt Box, leading to the resignation of two agency lawyers. Critics in the crypto industry, including lawyer John Deaton, have been very vocal in their disapproval of Tenreiro’s approach. Deaton even warned firms against hiring him if he leaves the SEC. Tenreiro’s promotion happened at the same time as other leadership changes in the agency’s crypto unit. Mark Sylvester and Laura D’Allaird , former assistant director and counsel to outgoing Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga, respectively, have been named co-chiefs of the crypto assets and cyber unit.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | LUNA | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6378/paul-atkins-uncertain-about-taking-role-as-trump-s-sec-chair,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Atkins hasn’t confirmed whether he will accept the position, but his selection has boosted prices across the board, with BTC also up by 4% in the past week and 40% in the last 30 days. And what’s particularly bullish about Bitcoin in the near term is that its chart has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, signaling an incoming breakout. Its renewed momentum suggests that it could easily reach $100,000 by the end of the year, with the arrival of a second Trump administration likely to provide plenty of boosts over the coming year. Bitcoin Price Action Forms ‘Symmetrical Triangle Pattern’ – Breakout to $100,000 Incoming? Looking at BTC’s one-hour price chart, the cryptocurrency is currently on a bounce, with its RSI (yellow) bouncing up from 30 last night. This reflects rising momentum, but the most bullish feature of the chart below is that Bitcoin’s resistance and support levels have formed a classic triangle pattern. Source: TradingView In other words, the levels are squeezing BTC’s price between narrower ranges, pushing it to a point where it will have to break out. BTC had retraced its steps over the past couple of weeks, having failed to break through the $100,000 level around November 22. It has since been slowly regaining strength, with the positive news regarding Paul Atkins and also the possibility of BTC reserves helping it to recover. 1/ $BTC Struggles at Resistance: #Bitcoin is battling resistance in the $90k-$98k range, printing bearish divergence signals and resembling price action from previous bull markets (2016 and 2020).

We may therefore have to wait a week or so before significant action arrives, yet such action should come by the end of the year. And the longer term picture looks incredibly good for the Bitcoin price, with the return of Trump likely to bring very bullish policy announcements. The four year #Bitcoin cycle is dead, IMO. This time is different: 1. $MSTR buying the entire new supply 2. $MSTR copy-cats/other corporate buyers 3. Nation states buying/establishing $BTC reserves 4.

Massively… pic.twitter.com/t4ozkitqn2 — Mark Harvey (@thepowerfulHRV) November 15, 2024 Not only could we see US states and corporations accumulating BTC as a reserve, but the new Trump administration is also likely to introduce crypto-friendly legislation . As such, the Bitcoin price could potentially reach $125,000 by the first quarter of 2025, before rising to around $150,000 by the second half of the year. Strong Alternatives for Market-Beating Gains Bitcoin will continue leading the cryptocurrency market for the foreseeable future, yet the current bull market will also see numerous other tokens make substantial gains. In fact, new coins can often outperform BTC in terms of percentage gains, particularly if they come with genuine utility and fundamentals. And one new token with bullish features is Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) , an ERC-20 token that has just launched its presale. Who said money doesn’t grow on trees pic.twitter.com/tRLhkEnEBu — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) December 4, 2024 It has already raised $400,000 in just under 24 hours, providing a very strong sign of its appeal and future success. WEPE isn’t simply another bog-standard meme token, but also a platform that will provide traders with analysis and market insights. By holding its native token, Wall Street Pepe’s platform will provide users with exclusive buying signals and insider trading strategies. It will also come with its own community, who can not only share tips and analysis, but will also have the chance to compete in trading competitions. Winners of such competitions will earn rewards in WEPE, while the token will also be open to staking, earning holders additional income. This all makes Wall Street Pepe look highly promising, with investors able to join its sale by going to its official website . There, they will be able to buy WEPE at a price of $0.000202, although this will increase in just under three days. Traders should therefore act quickly, since the early signs suggest that Wall Street Pepe could be a big one.

However, Ripple is reportedly awaiting approval from the New York Department of Financial Services, according to local media reports . What is RLUSD? Ripple USD (RLUSD), a 1:1 USD-backed stablecoin, offers transparency and stability on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum. With the launch of RLUSD, Ripple aims to leverage both its stablecoin and native token, XRP, to enhance its cross-border payment solutions. At present, Ripple Labs has warned investors and institutions to avoid engaging with any token claiming to be RLUSD or Ripple USD before its official launch to prevent falling victim to scams. Despite this warning, RLUSD is currently listed on the cryptocurrency data platform CoinGecko. Since August 2024, Ripple has been beta testing its RLUSD stablecoin on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum’s mainnet. The firm has shared plans to gradually expand RLUSD to more blockchains and DeFi protocols in the future. Will RLUSD Impact XRP Price? Despite the RLUSD launch, Ripple’s native token XRP, has already gained significant attention over the past week.

Are Others Next?,"The well-known American magazine Forbes, which has a history of over 100 years, warned investors against these altcoins in May, stating that 20 altcoins, with XRP in the first place, were zombie tokens. Stating that these altcoins are of little use other than speculative trading, Forbes said that the common feature of these altcoins is that they do not have any denominator and a significant user base in practice. Forbes listed these 20 altcoins as follows: XRP, ADA, LTC, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Internet Computer (ICP), ETC, Stellar (XLM), Stacks (STX), Kaspa (KAS), Theta (THETA), Fantom ( FTM), Monero (XMR), Arweave (AR), Algorand (ALGO), Flow (FLOW), MultiversX (EGLD), Bitcoin SV (BSV), Mina (MINA), Tezos (XTZ) and Eos (EOS). Related News: Forbes Warned About These 20 Altcoins! ""XRP, Litecoin (LTC) and Cardano (ADA) are also on the list!"" Seven months after the zombie altcoin list, some altcoins, especially XRP, recorded tremendous increases. After these increases, investors mocked this list of Forbes, reminding them of this list. While XRP, which Forbes calls a zombie token, has increased by 400% in the last 30 days, XLM has increased by 466%; ALGO by 406%; ADA by 263%; EOS by 174%; THETA by 170%; XTZ by 162%; EGLD by 130%; FLOW by 126%; FTM by 114%. While 10 altcoins, including XRP, have increased by more than 100 percent in the last 30 days, investors expect other altcoins to experience major increases in the coming days. *This is not investment advice.

37211769,https://cryptonews.com/?p=316155,1733320205,Argo Blockchain Records $3.4 Million Revenue Despite Decline in Bitcoin Mining,"London-based Bitcoin mining company Argo Blockchain reported $3.4 million in mining revenue for November 2024 despite a decrease in Bitcoin production. Argo Reports $3.4M Mining Revenue Amid Output Decline According to its press release on December 4, Argo disclosed mining 39 Bitcoin in November, compared to 46 in October, reflecting a drop in daily mining output from 1.5 BTC to 1.3 BTC. Despite the drop in Bitcoin production, Argo attributed the revenue increase to the “higher hash price and BTC price realized in November compared to October.” The Bitcoin miner recorded $3 million in October 2024. Our November operational update is out: Mined 39 Bitcoin in November Daily production was 1.3 Bitcoin per day Mining revenue of $3.4 million, an increase from $3.0 million in October Full RNS: https://t.co/M7FYVyVBBa #ARB $ARBK — Argo (@ArgoBlockchain) December 4, 2024 This news comes after a challenging third quarter (Q3), where the Bitcoin miner reported a 28% year-over-year revenue decline. Argo generated $7.5 million in revenue in Q3 2024, down from $10.4 million in the same period in 2023. The company’s mining margins also plummeted from 58% to just 8%, attributed mainly to the absence of power credits that bolstered last year’s performance. Revenue Trends Reflect Market Shifts In August 2024, Bitcoin mining revenue dropped to $827.56 million , marking the lowest monthly earnings since September 2023. Bitcoin mining profitability has been affected by rising energy costs, regulatory challenges, and fluctuating cryptocurrency prices. Despite the hurdles, Argo Blockchain managed to improve its net loss during Q3. The company reported a $6.3 million loss for the quarter, an improvement compared to the $9.9 million loss recorded in Q3 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, Argo’s total revenue reached $36.7 million, a slight increase from $34.4 million during the same period in 2023. Argo’s recent performance showcases resilience, but the sector continues to face volatility. Notably, Argo mined 123 BTC during Q3, maintaining an average daily output of 1.3 BTC. The company’s shares reflect market skepticism after the November update. Following the announcement, Argo’s stock dropped by 14.27% in pre-market trading, according to Nasdaq data. Argo Blockchain’s November results mirror broader trends in Bitcoin mining, where firms adapt to changing market dynamics. Higher Bitcoin mining difficulty in November gave many mining companies temporary relief, but concerns about operational costs remain. According to industry analysts, Hash Price fluctuations and rising energy costs remain significant obstacles for Bitcoin mining firms. Welcome to a new paradigm. Bitcoin Electrical Cost is now a whopping $77.4K. This is the raw electricity cost to power the network, per Bitcoin mined. Bitcoin Miner Price hit $244K on Saturday!

Ampere ( AMP ) has surged by about 300% from its yearly low, pushing its market capitalization to over $910 million. The surge coincides with a broader shift into older cryptocurrencies that outperformed in 2021, following notable surges in names like Stellar Lumens ( XLM ) and Ripple ( XRP ). AMP’s utility in the payment industry, particularly for its fast transaction speeds and low costs, has supported its price growth. Recently, AMP technology was integrated into Flexa , a growing payment network for e-commerce. AMP’s price also rose as crypto analysts expressed bullish sentiments about the coin. In a statement, CJ Bennet, a popular crypto analyst, noted that the coin was poised for more gains, potentially reaching a record high. $amp Patience prevails, my friends. Trust in the winning tech, and you'll be just fine. We have not only tapped the next zone that captured the measured expansion from the previous pennant, but it's also blown right through it and started to move up towards the major milestone… pic.twitter.com/oyENTiyqGE — CJ Bennett (@the_real_CJ) December 4, 2024 Amp’s all-time high was $0.037, meaning that it still needs to gain 235% from its current level to reach that milestone. The coin is also gaining as investors celebrate the arrival of altcoin season. Data from CoinMarketCap shows the altcoin season index has climbed to over 80, while the fear and greed index has risen to 88. Most altcoins tend to perform well during periods of high market greed. Meanwhile, there are signs that AMP whales are accumulating the coin. According to Etherscan, one whale moved tokens worth over $2 million from Coinbase, which is seen as a bullish signal. AMP price analysis AMP chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the AMP token price experienced a strong bullish breakout, reaching a high of $0.01450. It surpassed the crucial resistance level at $0.0091, its highest point on April 29. The coin has formed a golden cross pattern as the 200-day and 50-day moving averages crossed each other. The MACD and the Relative Strength Index also indicate upward momentum. Therefore, AMP needs to close above this week’s high of $0.01450 to confirm the bullish trend. A close below this high could validate a shooting star pattern, a common bearish indicator. If that occurs, the price may drop and retest the support at $0.0091.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,crypto.news,https://crypto.news/amp-price-is-rising-as-top-crypto-expert-sees-more-upside/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/37210728.jpeg

37211897,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51332,1733319894,Over 43% of XRP Tokens Are Still Not Circulating. Here’s the Significance,"The cryptocurrency community recently witnessed a heated debate on Twitter regarding XRP’s tokenomics, circulating supply, and market dynamics. The discussion began with IncomeSharks, a crypto education and analysis platform, criticizing the structure of XRP’s supply and its perceived impact on market sentiment and price stability. IncomeSharks’ argument highlights broader concerns within the crypto ecosystem about concentrated token ownership and periodic token releases. IncomeSharks pointed out that over 43% of XRP tokens remain out of circulation, largely due to Ripple’s escrow system . The platform suggested that such a supply structure would be criticized heavily if implemented by other projects, referring to scenarios such as projects hosted on platforms like Pump Fun. Over 43% of the $XRP tokens are still not even circulating. Imagine if you were on Pump Fun and saw the developer owned 43% of supply. There's a reason this space collectively dislikes this token because it's always pumping and dumping. pic.twitter.com/n7wMvyU2nR — IncomeSharks (@IncomeSharks) December 2, 2024 It emphasized the potential for pump-and-dump scenarios, characterized by abrupt surges and declines in price, attributing this volatility partly to the token’s escrow releases. Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto responded to this claim, countering the narrative by emphasizing that XRP in the escrow is not the same as unrestricted holdings by developers in speculative projects. According to CrediBULL, most of the monthly 1 billion XRP token unlocks from escrow are relocked immediately, with only a small percentage entering circulation. This mechanism, they argued, prevents manipulation and ensures a predictable token supply. CrediBULL further addressed the broader criticism of XRP, stating that the token has consistently ranked among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This, they argued, is evidence of the market’s confidence in XRP, despite skepticism from certain factions of the cryptocurrency space. IncomeSharks replied by reiterating concerns about the monthly escrow unlocks, describing them as a contributing factor to XRP’s lack of differentiation within the industry. The platform also suggested that the token’s sporadic price surges do not reflect its utility or technological merit. It argued that the market tends to ignore XRP’s potential for years until a sudden price rally prompts renewed interest. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 CrediBULL responded by emphasizing that around 80% of the monthly escrow releases are relocked for an additional five years, underscoring that this information is public and verifiable. They criticized the selective omission of such details in arguments against XRP and reaffirmed their consistent engagement with the token’s developments over time. Broader Implications for XRP and the Crypto Community The debate sheds light on two contrasting perspectives within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Critics like IncomeSharks view the escrow system and concentrated token ownership as vulnerabilities, potentially undermining investor confidence and long-term stability. Proponents, such as CrediBULL, argue that these mechanisms provide transparency and prevent the uncontrolled distribution of tokens, fostering a more sustainable ecosystem. XRP’s escrow system has been a contentious topic for years. The system unlocks 1 billion XRP usually on the first day of every month. Subsequently, about 80% of the whopping tokens are returned to escrow at Ripple. The firm has stated that unused tokens are locked back to ensure a controlled release schedule, aligning with market needs. Despite these measures, XRP remains a divisive topic among crypto enthusiasts. While it consistently ranks as one of the most prominent cryptocurrencies, its association with Ripple and the escrow system continues to attract criticism.

As this new month starts, Finbold looked at Bitcoin’s historical returns to provide a BTC price projection for December 31. In hindsight, Bitcoin closed November with 37.29% gains, within Finbold’s predicted price range using this same methodology. On November 2, we published the BTC price prediction targeting a monthly close between $75,275 and $100,334, while the leading cryptocurrency was trading at $69,495. Bitcoin closed November 30 at $96,451, validating the method, which we will now repeat for this month. Bitcoin historical returns in December since 2013 Data from Coinglass shows December is usually a month of consolidation, without many expressive results either up and downwards. Notably, Bitcoin’s monthly performance in December, dating back from 2013, has accumulated 5.00% gains on average. However, with six negative years out of eleven, December also has a median return of minus 1.73%. These returns are measured from opening to closing, or December 1 to 31. For example, Bitcoin’s historical best December was in 2020, up 46.92% after a 42.95% November. Something similar also happened in 2017, with a 53.48%-gain November followed by a 38.89%-up December. Nevertheless, 2013 was December’s worst year after November’s best yearly performance, with -34.81% and +449.35%, respectively. Overall, all positive November years were followed by an also positive December with the exception of 2013 and 2014. Bitcoin Monthly returns (%), November and December highlighted. Source: CoinGlass / Finbold / Vini Barbosa Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction by December 31, 2024 As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $95,930, below December’s opening price of $96,451. The leading cryptocurrency now consolidates after breaking out of high and low time frame downtrends that led to its rally. Therefore, based on its historical returns, BTC could trade between $94,782 and $101,273 by the end of 2024. The prediction projects Bitcoin’s price from December’s opening using the median and average historical returns if BTC keeps its pattern. Yet, it could go even higher if mirroring November’s performance as it has before in bull market years. Bitcoin (BTC) 30-day price chart.

According to Chair Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve is on track to cut its key interest rates in the coming months. This rate cut aligns perfectly with the crypto bull run as it could see assets such as Avalanche and Dogecoin register meteoric upticks. Dogecoin's price has already been up over 168% in the last month, and Avalanche is set to flip its previous ATH, which has had a 102% uptick in the last 30 days. However, with tons of liquidity flowing into the market during this crypto rally, Rollblock is bound to gain the most, given that its RBLK token is still in its presale. RBLK has already surged over 270% since the start of its presale, and Rollblock's focus on the GambleFi niche has seen experts forecast a potential crypto rally on launch. Dogecoin's price surged over 150% as holders eye $1 As the crypto rally prepares for its next uptick, with Bitcoin's price now settling around the $96,000 region, Dogecoin's price has also found support around the $0.40 zone. Analysts forecast incoming market corrections for Dogecoin's price; however, bullish sentiment is only increasing. Just recently, DOGE holders had a significant breakthrough, with DOGE getting its first exchange-traded product listing on the stock market. This level of recognition solidifies DOGE's position as the top meme coin. Avalanche (AVAX) on track to surpass previous ATH in this crypto rally Avalanche (AVAX) is also on the rise in this crypto rally, with its price surging an impressive 102% in the last 30 days. Avalanche's AVAX, which is built on a general-purpose blockchain, could easily surge 3x from its current price of under $50. AVAX price also recently had a boost upward after news broke out that Avalanche was in talks with the incoming U.S. administration. Given Trump's positive outlook on crypto, Avalanche could soon surge past its previous ATH in this crypto rally. Rollblock's RBLk surges over 270% as crypto rally continues Another crypto project on the verge of a crypto rally is Rollblock's RBLK . Currently, in its presale, Rollblock is championing a bridge between cryptocurrencies and the budding online gambling market. The presale has reached stage 8, and RBLK's price has surged by over 270% since the start. With the online gambling market set to be worth over $744 billion by 2028, Rollblock is spearheading a revolutionary GambleFi protocol that is built with transparency in mind. Rollblock comes with a community-backed crypto casino that offers generous rewards and payouts. A portion of the casino's profits are used to buy back RBLK from the open market, thereby boosting RBLK's crypto rally. What's more, Rollblock offers provably fair casino games as every transaction is registered on the blockchain for an added layer of transparency. There is also a 30% APY staking program for RBLK holders, and players get VIP bonuses and high payouts. So far, the ongoing presale has raised over $6.5 million, and with Rollblock's innovative revenue share model and a community-centric approach, analysts have predicted a crypto rally for RBLK once it's launched on major exchanges.

BlockDAG, Bitcoin, Ripple & Solana Are the Best Cryptos to Buy This Week!","Choosing the right crypto to invest in can be challenging, especially with so many options available. The market is full of opportunities, but not all cryptos are made equal. For those looking to secure solid investments for the short term and long term, it’s important to focus on coins that have consistently delivered strong technology and solid returns throughout their lifetime. From the rising potential of BlockDAG (BDAG) to the proven stability of Bitcoin, this guide highlights four of the best cryptos to buy now. Keep reading to discover what makes each one stand out. 1. BlockDAG: Star Innovator In The Blockchain World BlockDAG is emerging as one of the most exciting blockchain platforms on the market. Unlike traditional blockchains, BlockDAG uses Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, which allows for faster and more scalable transactions. This innovative approach means BlockDAG can handle high volumes of transactions without compromising on scalability or decentralization, making it ideal for applications in DeFi, NFTs, and meme coins. Currently priced at $0.0234, BlockDAG has raised over $155 million in its presale, with 16.7 billion coins sold. Early backers have already seen a staggering 2,240% ROI, and with predictions for BlockDAG to hit $1 by 2025, it’s clear that this project has a massive ROI potential. Whether traders are looking for a short-term play or a long-term hold, BlockDAG is one of the best cryptos to buy this week. 2. Bitcoin: The Undisputed King of Crypto Bitcoin (BTC) remains the gold standard in the crypto market. As the first cryptocurrency, it has built its reputation as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Even though Bitcoin's major growth has already happened, its continued dominance in the market ensures it remains a safe bet for investors. Bitcoin’s recent breakthroughs, such as institutional adoption and the growing support for Bitcoin ETFs, reinforce its position as a stable asset in a volatile market. It might not deliver the same high returns as altcoins like BlockDAG, but it is still a great option for anyone seeking security in their portfolio. 3. XRP: The Cross-Border Payment Solution XRP has long been recognized for its ability to reform cross-border payments. XRP aims to replace traditional banking systems like SWIFT with a faster, cheaper alternative, making it an essential asset for global remittances. The expanding list of partnerships validates XRP’s growth trajectory. XRP’s recent surge past $1.5 shows strong market sentiment, and with Ripple's legal battles with the SEC potentially nearing resolution, there’s room for even more upside. Analysts have pegged XRP’s price target at $3.84, with some even suggesting it could hit $10. While XRP’s integral role in global payments makes it one of the best cryptos to buy this week, its ongoing legal issues still pose a risk for more conservative investors. 4. Solana: Speed, Scalability, and Growing Demand Solana (SOL) has emerged as one of the top players in the blockchain space, known for its high-speed transaction capabilities and ultra-low fees. As Ethereum’s main competition in the dApp and NFT space, Solana is the blockchain of choice for developers and traders looking for a faster, cheaper alternative. Despite recent challenges, such as network outages, Solana’s ecosystem continues to grow rapidly, particularly with the increasing popularity of meme coins and decentralized finance projects. While Solana is an exciting growth story, its volatility and past network issues may make it a riskier choice for some investors. In Summary: The Best Cryptos to Buy this Week These 4 best cryptos to buy this week boast a unique set of strengths, catering to different investor needs. Bitcoin, is perfect for those seeking stability and growth, as it is an industry leader with a steady incline. XRP offers exciting growth potential with its cross-border payment solution, while Solana, known for its speed and scalability, is great for those looking to ride the wave of growing dApps demand. Meanwhile, BlockDAG puts a spin on the old blockchain and adds new technology that has massive potential for both short-term and long-term gains. Because BlockDAG is still in its presale phase, this is the perfect time to capitalize on the anticipated returns to come over the next few years.

37210364,https://coinpedia.org/?p=389206,1733319350,Hyperliquid’s HYPE Token Explodes! What’s Behind the 200% Rally?,"The post Hyperliquid’s HYPE Token Explodes! What’s Behind the 200% Rally? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The HYPE token, launched by Hyperliquid , has seen an impressive surge of over 200% since its token generation event (TGE) on November 29. Currently trading at $12.30, up more than 36% in the last 24 hours, the token’s rapid price increase has pushed its fully diluted valuation (FDV) above $12 billion. With 333 million tokens circulating out of a total supply of 1 billion, HYPE now has a market capitalization of around $4 billion. Hyperliquid’s Successful Launch Hyperliquid, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, debuted on November 29 with HYPE priced at $3.90. The total value of the airdrop event reached $1.2 billion, with 31% of the total supply distributed to the community. Since then, the price has continued to rise, reaching an all-time high of $12.95 on December 4. Why Investors Are Excited About HYPE The excitement around HYPE goes beyond just its price. Several factors have contributed to the positive sentiment. First, the token generation event was smooth, with no technical issues or complaints about the distribution. Notably, there was no allocation for venture capitalists (VCs) or private investors, which helped create a fairer distribution. The distribution also shows good decentralization, with only a few large wallets holding a significant portion of the supply. 8 Reasons why you should start BUYING $HYPE below 10$ pic.twitter.com/P4sUZyGqjj — Base (@Basesol_NFT) December 3, 2024 The TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) feature is another reason users are enthusiastic. It divides large orders into smaller ones executed in 30-second intervals, ensuring a maximum slippage of 3%. There is strong demand for HYPE, reflected in the large difference between buy and sell orders through TWAP. Additionally, HYPE is deflationary, burning about 26% of its supply each year. HYPE’s Growing Investor Interest HYPE’s growing investor interest is clear from its 24-hour trading volume of over $279 million. Hyperliquid has quickly become a leader in both trading volume and total value locked (TVL) among decentralized perpetual swap platforms. Since its launch, Hyperliquid’s valuation has surged by more than 514%, with its current market cap exceeding $4.2 billion. This rapid growth has sparked interest in which other projects could replicate Hyperliquid’s success. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Algorand (ALGO) Could Be Your Best Crypto Buy Right Now – Here’s Why , Other Projects with Noteworthy Airdrop Strategies Other projects are also gaining attention with their airdrop strategies: Arkham : Arkham, which recently shifted from blockchain services to a perpetual exchange, mirrors Hyperliquid’s airdrop strategy by rewarding users who trade and refer new participants. Grass : Grass distributed 10% of its total token supply in its first airdrop on Solana. Participants earned tokens by contributing computing power and engaging with the network. In its second phase, Grass plans to distribute 17% of the total supply to the community. LayerZero : LayerZero allocated 15% of its ZRO token supply for future incentivized activities. An additional 23.8% is reserved for users and developers. Analysts suggest engaging with LayerZero’s bridge services and participating in its Discord roles program to earn more tokens. Wormhole : Known for its multi-chain interoperability, Wormhole’s early airdrop strategy has been successful. While only 6% of its W token supply is reserved for community rewards, its focus on high-value transactions shows potential for growth as adoption increases. The Future of Decentralized Platforms Zeta Markets co-founder Anmol Singh pointed out that the high trading volumes surrounding HYPE’s launch indicate the growing importance of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and perpetual platforms. Singh predicts that by 2025, most token launches will take place on DEXs, making them the preferred choice over centralized exchanges (CEXs). FAQs Why has HYPE token price surged so much? HYPE’s price surged over 200% since its launch due to a successful token generation event, positive sentiment, and strong demand.

Inching closer to its psychological mark of $0.010, the overnight surge of more than 10% has driven its market cap to $998 million. As the trading volume surges to $401 million, the Notcoin is soon to become a billion-dollar altcoin. Will this extend the ongoing rally to a new all-time high? Let’s find out. Notcoin Price Analysis In the daily chart, the Notcoin price action shows a recovery rally surpassing a long-coming resistance trend line. This marks a falling channel breakout rally with a burst in trend momentum. Tradingview The breakout rally had struggled to surpass the 38.20% trend level at $0.0094. However, with the double bottom formation and the 100-day EMA line acting as the base, NOT token price has surpassed the crucial resistance. The overhead supply zone extends from $0.0097 to the psychological mark of $0.010. Currently, Notcoin is trading at $0.009743, following last night’s 9% jump. Over the past 24 hours, it has increased by more than 10% and is heading to reclaim the psychological mark. With the bullish turnaround and the neckline breakout, the immediate resistance for Notcoin is at $0.011, or the 50% Fibonacci level. Notcoin Technicals and Price Targets The bullish trend in the MACD and Signal lines has avoided a bearish crossover twice, revealing strong underlying bullishness. Furthermore, the 20-day EMA line is giving a bullish crossover with the 100-day EMA line, reflecting a short-term surge in underlying bullishness. A bull run beyond this point will mark a change in the trend character of Notcoin, bringing $0.016 and $0.022 as the next potential price targets. Hence, the altcoin shows a potential upside of more than 130% in the coming month. On the other hand, crucial support remains the 50-day EMA line at $0.0080 and the 100-day EMA line at $0.0085.

With prices reaching levels not seen since 2018 and a surge in whale activity driving the momentum, the Ripple-affiliated token has captured widespread attention. Analysts note a combination of institutional interest, robust network growth, and significant wallet accumulation as key factors behind XRP's recent rally, while the broader market also shows signs of renewed interest in established altcoins. Ripple CTO Celebrates 12 Years at the Helm David Schwartz, the Chief Technology Officer of Ripple, celebrated a significant milestone as XRP reached a pivotal moment in its history. Schwartz, who officially marked 12 years at Ripple, saw the cryptocurrency he helped pioneer climb to third place by market capitalization, overtaking major players like Tether (USDT) and Solana (SOL). This achievement comes as XRP’s blistering rally continued on Sunday, with the cryptocurrency surging by over 28% in just 24 hours. The token’s price skyrocketed to a new multi-year high of $2.48, a monumental feat for the Ripple-affiliated digital asset. The ascent to the third spot is a significant comeback story for XRP, which had faced the threat of being pushed out of the top 10 cryptocurrencies following the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple. The regulatory turmoil had cast a long shadow over XRP’s future, but the latest surge has reinvigorated investor confidence. With a market capitalization of $139 billion, XRP now surpasses major global corporations like Citigroup, Airbus, and Sony. However, it still trails Ethereum (ETH), which maintains a formidable market cap of $444 billion, solidifying its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin (BTC). While XRP’s 30% daily gain is impressive, it was not the best-performing cryptocurrency among the top 100. Hedera (HBAR) outshined XRP with an eye-popping 42% gain within the same timeframe. HBAR also eclipsed XRP’s weekly performance, boasting a 78% increase compared to XRP’s 69%. The market’s bullish sentiment extended to other legacy altcoins as well. Litecoin (LTC) and EOS (EOS) posted notable gains of 20.2% and 20.5%, respectively, as traders diversified into time-tested assets alongside their interest in XRP. XRP may have more fuel for its ongoing rally. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently confirmed he had recorded an interview with 60 Minutes, one of the most influential television news programs in the United States. While the air date for the interview remains unconfirmed, its eventual release could serve as a major catalyst for XRP’s continued growth. The interview is expected to spotlight Ripple’s regulatory battle with the SEC, XRP’s recent resurgence, and broader discussions on cryptocurrency’s future in the financial ecosystem. Given 60 Minutes’ reputation for shaping public opinion, the coverage could attract renewed mainstream attention to XRP and the cryptocurrency industry at large. What Lies Ahead for XRP? XRP’s remarkable climb to the third spot signals a resurgence for the cryptocurrency after years of uncertainty. While the token’s recent price surge and market cap position are undoubtedly impressive, surpassing Ethereum remains a distant goal. The gap between Ethereum’s $444 billion market cap and XRP’s $139 billion is vast, requiring sustained momentum and possibly groundbreaking developments for XRP to close the gap. Despite these challenges, XRP’s latest rally shows its enduring relevance in the cryptocurrency market. With a loyal community, significant institutional partnerships, and upcoming media exposure, the Ripple-affiliated cryptocurrency appears poised to remain a central player in the digital asset ecosystem. For now, all eyes remain on XRP’s price movements and the impact of Ripple’s ongoing legal and media strategies. Whether it can sustain its upward trajectory or face a pullback will depend on a combination of market dynamics, regulatory clarity, and broader adoption trends. XRP Hits Near-Seven-Year High as Whale Activity Reaches Unprecedented Levels XRP’s rapid growth has brought the crypto back into the spotlight, with analysts noting that its current trajectory mirrors the momentum it had during its peak years. The cryptocurrency’s resurgence is fueled by a mix of institutional and retail interest, with large holders, or “whales,” playing a pivotal role. On-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant revealed that whale activity for XRP has reached unprecedented levels. ”Since its launch, XRP has never captured the attention of whales to this extent,” the platform noted, emphasizing that current activity represents an all-time high for the cryptocurrency. Supporting this analysis, Santiment, another blockchain analytics provider, reported that wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP have accumulated a staggering 679.1 million tokens—worth $1.66 billion—in the past three weeks. Additionally, Santiment highlighted that XRP whales purchased an extra 160 million tokens over the weekend, amounting to approximately $380 million in value. This surge in accumulation is complemented by robust network growth. Over 22,000 new wallets were created on the XRP Ledger on Sunday alone, bringing the total number of non-empty XRP wallets to over 5.5 million—a first in the cryptocurrency’s eight-year history. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, pointed to Coinbase as a potential driving force behind XRP’s meteoric rise. Over the last 30 days, the price premium for XRP on Coinbase has fluctuated between 3% and 13%, suggesting significant whale activity on the US-based exchange. This trend suggests there is a growing interest from US investors despite ongoing regulatory uncertainty surrounding XRP. Interestingly, Upbit, a Korean exchange known for its substantial XRP investor base, showed no significant price premium during the same period. This disparity highlights the regional dynamics in XRP’s current rally, with Western markets seemingly leading the charge. Beyond whale activity, XRP’s network utility appears to be gaining traction. Santiment noted strong growth across multiple altcoin blockchains, with XRP standing out for its vibrant ledger activity. The creation of thousands of new wallets indicates increased retail and institutional interest in the cryptocurrency. Analysts have pointed out that while the short-term impact of this activity may result in price volatility, the long-term implications are promising. Growing utility on the XRP Ledger signals broader adoption and reinforces the cryptocurrency’s relevance in the market. Can XRP Sustain Its Momentum? Despite its impressive rally, XRP faces hurdles. Achieving the $3 mark would be a symbolic victory, but sustaining such levels amid increased retail engagement and potential profit-taking remains uncertain. Furthermore, regulatory challenges, particularly in the US, continue to loom over Ripple and its native token. Nevertheless, the ongoing accumulation by whales and the surge in network activity offer a solid foundation for XRP’s long-term growth. If the momentum continues, XRP could further solidify its position as a leading cryptocurrency, potentially narrowing the gap with Ethereum (ETH), which boasts a significantly larger market cap of over $444 billion. XRP’s near-seven-year high and record-breaking whale activity signal a remarkable comeback for the cryptocurrency. With substantial gains over the past month and robust network growth, XRP is poised for an exciting future. However, whether it can sustain its meteoric rise and overcome challenges will depend on a confluence of market dynamics, regulatory clarity, and continued utility growth on the XRP Ledger. As the crypto world watches closely, XRP’s next moves could redefine its role in the digital asset ecosystem.",POSITIVE,ETH | XRP,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6380/ripple-cto-marks-12-years-as-xrp-rallies-to-multi-year-high,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

42389474,5c8e40d1-c537-4384-b92a-9513404703ec,1733318899,One Year of Javier Milei: Why Argentinian Crypto Folks Can’t Get Enough of Him,"It has been almost exactly a year since Javier Milei became the 59th President of Argentina.  Inaugurated on December 10, 2023, the flamboyant libertarian economist — a former goalkeeper who cloned his dogs and called central banks “the worst garbage that exists on this Earth” — had vowed to end the South American nation’s hyperinflation crisis and to drastically reduce government spending.  Since then, Argentina’s monthly inflation rate has fallen from 25.5% in December 2023 to 2.7% last October. The government has registered a fiscal surplus for nine months in a row, a substantial achievement considering it’s been running deficits since 2008. The Argentinian peso isn’t in freefall against the U.S. dollar anymore. And while the country’s economy is projected to have shrunk by 4% in 2024, a 6% rebound is expected in 2025.  For at least some, the biggest surprise so far is that Milei actually followed through on most of his campaign promises, according to Alfonso Campenni, Latin American growth lead at Matter Labs, the main developer behind the Ethereum layer-2 protocol ZKsync.  “For Argentinians, it’s super hard to understand the concept of a politician doing his job,” Campenni, a native of Buenos Aires, told CoinDesk in an interview. “At this time of the year, people are usually mad because they can’t buy things for Christmas [because of hyperinflation]. But now it’s like: ‘Okay, maybe this is something new.’ It’s peaceful, it’s super weird.”  “I was at a tech event where Milei was invited. He got a standing ovation when he arrived on stage,” Jack Saracco, another Buenos Aires native and the co-founder of crypto payment platform Ping, told CoinDesk. “Most Argentinian crypto people love what he’s doing. There’s a meme going around: ‘When are we going to be able to vote for him again? Because I would vote for him over and over again. He's doing exactly what I voted for.’”  The reforms have had costs, though. Argentina’s poverty rate spiked to almost 53% in the first six months of 2024, from roughly 42% in the second part of 2023, as Milei’s administration slashed funding for a number of welfare programs and laid off tens of thousands of public employees.  “During the campaign, he said, ‘I won't lie to the Argentinians, we have very tough years ahead of us,’” Campenni said. “He was super honest on what will happen [in the years to come].”  Milei’s ideological kinship with crypto  The crypto sector’s enthusiasm for Milei is notable considering that, unlike President Nayib Bukele in El Salvador, the 54-year-old economist hasn’t shown particular interest in developing a national regulatory framework for digital assets.  “His primary focus has been addressing the country's economic crisis,” Juan Aranovich, an Argentine research analyst at crypto venture fund Ryze Labs, told CoinDesk. “These initiatives have dominated his agenda and left little room for crypto specific policies.”  Even so, the crypto scene, locally and internationally, has resonated with Milei’s brand of libertarianism.  Bitcoin was designed to permit individuals to transact digitally without third-party intermediaries, and Satoshi Nakamoto’s message in the Genesis Block is an explicit criticism of Western monetary policy in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.  Milei, for his part, vowed during his presidential campaign to shut down the Argentinian central bank, telling Bloomberg: “Central banks are divided in four categories: the bad ones, like the Federal Reserve, the very bad ones, like the ones in Latin America, the horribly bad ones, and the Central Bank of Argentina.”  The Argentine president has yet to follow through on that particular pledge. In the meantime, he has encouraged a dollarization of the nation’s economy, meaning to increase the circulation of U.S. dollars and reduce the population’s reliance on pesos.  “Dollarization is a fiat-based approach which contrasts with Bitcoin’s vision of decentralized money,” Aranovich said. “[American crypto entrepreneur] Balaji Srinivasan called Milei a Bitcoin President, but this is a misinterpretation of his stance.”  Saracco agreed. “I don’t think dollarization is the best way to go, because we will basically be adopting the U.S. dollar inflation,” he said. “The U.S. is doing a pretty poor job at auditing government spending, and at not funding so many wars. … If we dollarize our economy, we will be at the mercy of Washington.”  That’s why, at the end of the day, crypto in Argentina remains a grassroots affair. Chainalysis ranked the country number 15 out of 151 countries in terms of crypto adoption in its 2024 report. The country’s stablecoin trading volume, already on a steady rise, exploded three months into Milei’s term. Yes, the government has been relatively supportive of crypto technology, but decades of economic mismanagement have created high levels of distrust in public institutions. That distrust will compel Argentinians to keep using crypto even if the economic crisis ends, Saracco argued.  Coming back to Argentina  For years, rampant inflation compelled Argentinians to try and save money in U.S. dollars, to the point where the state imposed currency controls, placing a $200-per-month limit on the amount of dollars Argentinians can legally purchase. This, in turn, birthed a cash-based black market where greenbacks — called blue dollars, for the blue stripe found on $100 bills — can be exchanged for a much higher rate than the official one.  One year into Milei’s presidency, these capital controls are still in place, though the government has rolled out a tax amnesty program to encourage Argentinians to deposit foreign currencies into bank accounts, thereby drawing the money back into the formal economy. Roughly $277 billion U.S. dollars are thought to be stashed away outside the financial system, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Census.  But the discrepancy between the official dollar/peso rate and the blue dollar/peso rate has shrunk to almost nothing. In the days before Milei’s election, you could get 350 pesos for one dollar at the official rate, but close to 1,000 pesos per dollar on the black market. The official rate is now at 1,032 pesos, while blue dollars cost 1,090 pesos. For Argentinians, it’s a sign that the economy is healing  “Normally everybody is talking about politics all the time, all day long, everything is politics here, politics and football,” Campenni said. “Now nobody is talking all day about politics. … It’s like you’re at a sunset and everything is okay.”  The fact that Milei is famous internationally is a point of pride, too. The Argentine president was the first foreign leader to visit U.S. President-elect Donald Trump after his electoral victory in November; his meetings with Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk have also boosted his image abroad and at home, according to Campenni. “I’ve been to Istanbul and Denver and everybody was calling Milei a superhero,” he said.  For Aranovich, the big test will be the midterm elections, scheduled for October 2025. These, he said, will provide insight into the public’s perception of the government’s shock therapy policy. Milei’s political party, La Libertad Avanza, currently has 40 seats out of 257 in the nation’s Chamber of Deputies, and seven seats out of 72 in the Senate. The party has held a solid lead in most opinion polls for the legislative elections, but a lot can happen in the span of 11 months.  Campenni is optimistic. “A lot of people left our country during the COVID pandemic, and now they're coming back to Argentina, because there are a lot of possibilities,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/12/04/one-year-of-javier-milei-why-argentinian-crypto-folks-can-t-get-enough-of-him,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b39e5b94ac4b1f3feacb65d1ab7bcfda1b4ecf8-2067x1163.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While Bitcoin (BTC) remains in a short-term bearish consolidation, large-cap altcoins are driving the market forward, fueled by increased cash inflows.

37210561,https://invezz.com/?p=2356349,1733318851,PancakeSwap announces Pump.fun like token deployer for BNB chain,"Decentralised exchange PancakeSwap has unveiled a new token deployer that allows users to launch meme coins and other crypto tokens without requiring any coding. Dubbed SpringBoard, the new feature launched on December 4 and is integrated into the PancakeSwap platform, allowing anyone to create a token directly on the BNB chain . According to PancakeSwap, the platform’s key focus is to provide a no-code, user-friendly solution for token creation and launch, ensuring inclusivity by lowering barriers and fostering transparent and secure token distribution through its “fair launch” mechanism. As such, deploying tokens on the platform doesn’t require any pre-sales or seed funding rounds, as is the case with traditional token launch methods or other platforms that prioritise early investor advantages. SpringBoard sets itself apart from other token deployers by offering an all-in-one token creation and launch process with features like automatic liquidity pairing, anonymous PancakeSwap developer Chef Kids explained in a statement. Unlike other platforms, the liquidity pairing mechanism eliminates the need for external decentralized exchanges by linking tokens directly to PancakeSwap’s liquidity, ensuring they become tradable immediately upon reaching 100% on the bonding curve. Chef kids described the SpringBoard as a full ecosystem rather than just a regular launchpad. He also cited the growing demand for a simplified and secure token creation process, emphasizing that the platform is designed to support a wide range of projects, not just meme coins. The platform will also help boost the liquidity of launched tokens via the SpringBoard Farm Program. Projects meeting criteria such as active community engagement, consistent trading volume, and 100% liquidity on SpringBoard will undergo a weekly review by PancakeSwap chefs. Selected projects will benefit from CAKE incentives for their liquidity pools, enhanced exposure through PancakeSwap’s channels, and improved market stability and trading liquidity on PancakeSwap DEX. Following the announcement, the price of CAKE, PancakeSwap’s native utility token, surged over 20% to hit a daily high of $4.34. At press time, the token was up 29.5%, trading at $4.09. A competitive market SpringBoard is set to compete against platforms like Solana’s Pump.fun, Ethereum’s Etherfun, and Tron network’s Sun.pump, which have gained traction by enabling users to launch tokens without coding expertise. The demand for such no-code token launch platforms has surged, particularly with the rise of meme coins. These platforms have facilitated the rapid creation and circulation of meme coins, leading to a significant increase in their numbers and corresponding promotional activities. For instance, over the past months, Pump.fun alone has surpassed the daily revenue of the Ethereum network on multiple occasions. In November alone, the platform generated over $93 million in revenue, according to DeFiLlama data, a 270% hike from the $30.5 million the previous month. On the other hand, Tron’s SunPump surpassed $1 million in revenue within weeks of its launch, while Etherfun quickly expanded to the Base network due to rising demand less than a month after its debut. However, Pump.fun remains the dominant platform in the space, maintaining its lead with consistently high revenue and user engagement.

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE.

37210113,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622501,1733318703,Britain plans to take on the US as a global crypto hub — but can they?,"The crypto sector received positive news as Britain launched a renewed effort to establish itself as a leading global crypto hub. However, the Europen nation faces significant challenges, including pushback from domestic entrepreneurs and fierce competition from the US under President-elect Donald Trump. The Labour government in Britain has promised to make the country a destination for crypto companies and blockchain-related businesses to thrive. In a recent interview, Tulip Siddiq, the UK’s Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said that the government wants to work with businesses on draft laws for digital assets like stablecoins (tokens whose value is tied to the value of sovereign currencies) “as early as possible next year.” British assertions about its crypto hub rebrand According to reports , Britain’s Economic secretary asserted that the government would not look at crypto-staking services as collective investment plans. The reason is that the services give users rewards based on the number of tokens they hold. Insiders in the crypto business were worried that this kind of treatment would have led to too many rules and regulations. Poppy Gustafsson, Britain’s investment minister, said, “The government is committed to fostering and embracing blockchain.” He continued to say that they are already taking decisive steps to support this sector and ensure that the nation stays at the forefront of this global innovation. In an event, Gustafsson also said, “This is a sector with enormous potential and a sector that’s already playing a central role in the UK’s vibrant tech landscape.” Its Digital Securities Sandbox is a testbed for researching novel solutions based on distributed ledger technology for the issuance, trading, and settlement of securities in a live regulated environment. An additional case in point is the “digital gilt” pilot program that was introduced just last month with the intention of issuing blockchain-based UK government bonds. What are the odds the UK rivals the US in the global arena? According to a survey released last month, the average value of crypto held by Brits rose from £1,595 ($2,021) a year ago to £1,842 ($2,334) this year. The growth highlights the increasing demand for crypto products in the country. In addition, Gordon of Coinbase said, “The UK has done a lot of work.” He explained that the United Kingdom has a great chance of succeeding in this field, but regulations must be clear. Britain now has a plan to regulate crypto. However, leaders in the crypto business are worried that waiting until 2026 to start a full regime could put the country behind its peers across the Atlantic. In addition, the CEO of KR1, an exchange-listed digital asset investment company with a focus on blockchain technology, George McDonaugh, complained that the outdated regulations in the UK are preventing crypto-focused investment firms like his from achieving greater public recognition. On the other hand, Trump ran on a platform that was overtly positive toward crypto. He promised not to sell the Bitcoin that the federal government holds. He also promised to replace Gary Gensler as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) because of his harsh enforcement regime on crypto firms. Following Trump’s victory, the entire crypto sector has experienced a major change, with many currencies entering bullish trajectories. This is perhaps the most compelling illustration of the US’s impact on the sector. Britain has been advised to follow the US’s lead, which is the right thing to do. That way, it won’t just be passive beneficiaries of blockchain or AI technology. Rather, it can play a big part in ensuring that these technologies bring value to the country. Still, Britain would need some modification in applying rules to meet unique circumstances in respective countries.

One such is Binance Coin (BNB), which has soared to a new all-time high six months later. In just the past 24 hours, BNB has surged by over 22%, reaching a record high of $793 on CoinMarketCap. This remarkable rise brings its year-to-date gains to nearly 200%. As of December 4, BNB has surpassed Solana (SOL) in market capitalization, securing its position as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency with a value of approximately $113 billion. Additionally, the crypto asset’s 24-hour trading volume has surged by 153%, reaching $6.28 billion on the same day. The price spike has triggered notable liquidations across the market. Data compiled by CoinGlass revealed that $5.4 million worth of short positions in BNB were liquidated in the past 24 hours. CoinGlass’s data further indicated a significant surge in BNB’s derivatives trading activity. Its volume, for instance, increased by 301% to $6.4 billion, and open interest rose by almost 40% to $1.5 billion, which suggests heightened market participation and growing speculative interest in the token. Despite a slight pullback, experts remain optimistic about BNB’s trajectory as the asset breached several key resistances. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez had previously said that a close above $662 for BNB could pave the way for a potential move to $1,630. This new milestone comes shortly after reports revealed that 35.5% of BNB Chain’s blocks were targeted by Sandwich attacks in November. In the past week alone, 645 Sandwich Bots were identified on the chain, impacting roughly 43,400 DEX traders. The trading volume on BNB Chain’s DEX for the week reached $9.232 million, with Sandwich Bot transactions contributing $1.322 million.

Read our XRP price prediction to stay ahead of the curve! Could XRP Take a Dip? Despite its rising trend, XRP’s price might face a correction in the near future. The coin is trading well above its short- and long-term moving averages, which could signal that a pullback is imminent. Key technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic Oscillator suggest overbought conditions, which often precede price drops. XRP may also be in the “markup” phase of the Wyckoff Method, where demand surpasses supply—typically followed by a “distribution” phase that leads to a sell-off.

37209957,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/from-passive-investment-to-active-control,1733318226,From Passive Investment to Active Control,"DAOs and the Global Shift in Decentralized Governance By Tapan Sangal The concept of ""day-to-day control"" serves as a critical regulatory benchmark distinguishing between investment and organizational structures. This principle determines whether an investment qualifies as a Collective Investment Scheme (CIS) or an investment contract by examining whether investors maintain operational control or delegate it to a separate entity. Global Legal Foundations of Day-to-Day Control The principle of day-to-day control is embedded in multiple legal frameworks worldwide: 1. United States - Howey Test: Established by the U.S. Supreme Court in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., this test determines whether an arrangement constitutes an ""investment contract"" based on the absence of day-to-day control, with management being handled by a separate entity. 2. India - SEBI Act: Section 11AA of the Securities and Exchange Board of India mirrors the Howey Test, using investors' lack of day-to-day control as a primary condition for classifying as a Collective Investment Scheme (CIS). 3. European Union - ESMA AIFMD Guidelines: The European Securities and Markets Authority identifies day-to-day discretion as a key differentiator between collective and direct investments, emphasizing continuous decision-making beyond ordinary shareholder votes. 4. United Kingdom - FCA Handbook: The Financial Conduct Authority's test determines whether investors directly manage assets or merely participate in schemesmanaged by others. 5. Canada incorporates similar principles, reflecting a global consensus on investor control's importance in distinguishing individual investments from collective schemes. This global alignment underscores that when investors lack day-to-day control over the management of their investments, the arrangement is more likely to be classified as a CIS or similar regulated structure, subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny. The consistency across jurisdictions highlights the universal recognition of investor control as a fundamental principle in financial regulation. How DAOs Enable Day-to-Day Control​​​​​​​​​ In decentralized organizational structures like DAOs, blockchain technology and on-chain governance redefine ""day-to-day control"" through transparent, automated, and democratic decision-making mechanisms that enable token holders to exercise real-time control. ​DAO-Based Voting and Governance Systems​​​​​​​​DAOs allow token holders to collectively manage assets through smart contracts and on-chain voting mechanisms.​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Key features include: 1. On-Chain Voting: Automated, tamper-proof voting system executing outcomes via smart contracts. 2. Transparency and Accountability: All transactions and decisions recorded on public, immutable ledgers. 3. Comprehensive Control Mechanisms: Token holders exercise day-to-day administrative and operational rights through: o Voting on routine decisionso Participating in key financial decisionso Influencing business strategieso Approving or rejecting proposed changes 4. Active Participation: Token holders function as co-owners with rights to: o Inspect financial recordso Monitor asset performanceo Supervise operations through voting 5. Custodian Role: While DAOs may employ custodians, their role remains limited and controlled by token holders, who can: o Restrict custodian actionso Direct custodian decisionso Replace or modify custodian roles 6. Direct Access and Oversight: Token holders maintain: o Physical asset survey rightso Direct operational supervisiono Management report review capabilities For DAOs operating in regulated sectors or with significant real-world assets, hybrid models combining both on-chain and off-chain components provide a flexible solution. In these structures, token holders maintain day-to-day control over digital assets while certain off-chain functions, such as legal compliance or custodial services, are handled by trusted intermediaries. These hybrid arrangements enable DAOs to meet regulatory benchmarks while preserving their decentralized ethos . The concept of day-to-day control is globally accepted as a critical regulatory principle for distinguishing between investment structures that require heavy oversight and those that do not. DAOs, through their innovative use of blockchain technology and on-chain governance, enable token holders to exercise this control in ways that traditional investment structures do not. By providing a transparent, democratic, and automated decision-making framework, DAOs address the regulatory benchmarks for day-to-day control, enabling compliance while promoting decentralization. In this sense, DAOs are not just compliant with global regulatory expectations—they also redefine the possibilities of what ""day-to-day control"" can mean in the digital era. This makes DAOs uniquely suited to navigate the complexities of modern regulatory environments, offering a forward-thinking solution for the governance of both digital and real-world assets . The comprehensive control mechanisms implemented by DAOs ensure that token holders have a level of engagement and authority over asset management that goes beyond traditional investment structures. By empowering investors with real-time decision-making capabilities, access to detailed information, and direct oversight of operations, DAOs create an investment environment that aligns closely with regulatory requirements for active investor participation and control. As regulatory frameworks continue to evolve, the decentralized and transparent nature of DAOs positions them as a potentially compliant and innovative approach to asset management and organizational governance. The ability of DAOs to provide investors with genuine day-to-day control over their investments may set a new standard for what constitutes active management in the eyes of regulators worldwide.

Investors are now showing interest in Cardano due to its market performance in recent months. As a platform aiming to scale sustainably through peer effort and study, Cardano has always shown good fundamentals and resilience in the market. With the crypto market now entering a phase of increased attention, ADA will likely increase rapidly and could even regain its position in the top 5 by market cap in 2025. Cardano Price Prediction Currently, Cardano is priced at $0.986. Based on the most recent projections, noticeable growth has been registered for Cardano, which is expected to rise by 19.33% and reach the $1.25 mark by December 29, 2024. Currently, the prevailing market situation may be called bullish, as evidenced by the Fear & Greed Index, which currently stands at 78 (Extreme Greed). In the past 30 days, Cardano has registered 70% green days in its time frame but surprisingly, has a bit of a pricing volatility standing at 39.13%, almost on the higher end. Come 2025, however, the forecast for the price of ADA now appears to be brighter, with a projected low of $1.62 and highs of approximately $5.36, while the average value lies at about $3.12. Perhaps the most bullish month for Cardano is likely to be August, which is when its price is expected to be 406.31% up from the current price. Should those predictions be realized, ADA could potentially have a parabolic run and re-enter the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap. The strong technicals of ADA and its price are further driven by the constant development of the ecosystem as well as the adoption of dApps and Smart Contract networks. Nonetheless, this momentum makes it evident that ADA has occupied an important place in the erupting blockchain industry, and it most certainly is a cryptocurrency to watch in the coming decade.

Filing and SEC Requirements Grayscale Investments, a leading digital asset manager, has initiated steps to convert its Solana Trust (GSOL) into a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). The firm filed the necessary documentation with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list the proposed ETF on NYSE Arca, the exchange responsible for the application. Grayscale’s proposal was submitted through a 19b-4 filing by NYSE Arca on December 3, 2024. The SEC requires this type of filing to review rule changes proposed by self-regulatory organizations, such as stock exchanges. If approved, the ETF would trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker GSOL. Accompanying the 19b-4 filing, Grayscale must also submit an S-1 registration statement. Approval of this form would pave the way for public listing. Grayscale’s Position in the Market Grayscale’s Solana Trust, launched in 2021 as the firm’s 16th investment product currently holds $134.2 million in assets under management. According to the filing, this makes it the world’s largest Solana-focused investment vehicle by assets. The Solana held by the trust represents approximately 0.1% of the total circulating supply of SOL tokens. The conversion from the existing Solana Trust to an ETF would mark another milestone for Grayscale , which has already transitioned its flagship Bitcoin and Ethereum trusts into ETFs earlier this year. The ETF’s custodian will be Coinbase Custody, while BNY Mellon Asset Servicing will serve as its administrator and transfer agent. These established institutions add a layer of credibility and security to the proposed product. Intensifying Competition for Solana ETFs Grayscale joins an increasingly crowded field of asset managers vying to launch the first Solana ETF. Competitors such as Bitwise, VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital have already filed similar proposals earlier this year. Franklin Templeton is reportedly considering entering the space as well. The growing interest in Solana ETFs aligns with the cryptocurrency’s strong market performance. Over the past year, Solana’s price has surged by 277%, with its market capitalization exceeding $112 billion. As of December 4, Solana is trading at $238, reflecting a year-to-date increase of over 130%. Outlook Grayscale’s move underscores the evolving demand for regulated investment products centered on blockchain assets. While the SEC’s approval process remains uncertain, Grayscale’s history of successful ETF launches could bolster its case. Should GSOL gain regulatory approval, it would offer institutional and retail investors a new avenue to gain exposure to Solana, further cementing its position in the digital asset ecosystem.

Since Nov. 20, the ETFs have seen strong daily uptake — other than Nov. 25 and 26 — capturing over $3 billion in net inflows, according to data source Farside Investors. On Tuesday, BlackRock's IBIT registered a  $693.3 million net inflow, the most since in  the period, bringing the lifetime tally to $32. 8 billion.  Meanwhile, open interest in CME futures has declined by almost 30,000 BTC ($3 billion) to 185,485 BTC, according to data source Glassnode.  The divergence is unusual and might be a sign of market participants buying the ETFs as outright bullish plays rather than as part of a price-neutral cash-and-carry strategy.  Since the ETFs debuted in January, institutions have primarily used them to set up that strategy, involving a long position in the ETF and a short position in the CME futures. The opposing positions let institutions pocket the futures premium while bypassing price risks. That's why ETF inflows and the CME open interest have tended to move in tandem.  Carry yield is still attractive  Note that the carry strategy is still attractive, offering returns far more attractive than the U.S. 10-year Treasury note or ether's staking yield.  As of writing, the annualized three-month basis in CME's BTC futures was 16%. In other words, setting up a cash and carry trade would earn you 16%, although it's a far cry from actually holding the cryptocurrency, which is up over 100% this year.

This revolutionary blockchain project, built to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) and decentralized technology, is generating significant buzz. With the presale underway, Lightchain AI has already positioned itself as one of the best crypto presales of 2024, offering early investors an unparalleled opportunity for exponential growth. If you're looking for the next big blockchain success story, the Lightchain AI presale might just be the answer. At the same time, investors are beginning to question whether popular giants like Solana can keep delivering the gains they’ve become known for. While Solana has its merits, the market’s attention is shifting toward lesser-known projects with high growth potential—projects like Lightchain AI. Lightchain AI: The Foundation for the Next Blockchain Revolution Lightchain AI isn’t just another blockchain; it’s a transformative ecosystem designed to harness the power of AI in a decentralized framework. At the core of Lightchain AI’s innovation is its unique Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, which rewards meaningful AI computations instead of relying on traditional mining or staking. The platform’s Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) is another standout feature, enabling developers to seamlessly integrate AI models and tasks into decentralized applications (dApps). Combined, these advancements create a blockchain that’s scalable, secure, and optimized for real-world use cases. Here’s why Lightchain AI stands out: Utility-Driven Tokenomics: The Lightchain Token (LCAI) powers governance, AI task payments, and premium platform features, ensuring constant demand within the ecosystem. Privacy-Preserving Technology: Leveraging Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and federated learning, Lightchain AI ensures that sensitive data is protected while fostering collaboration. Scalability: Techniques like sharding and Layer 2 integrations allow Lightchain AI to handle AI-intensive workloads without sacrificing speed or performance. With its presale underway, investors can acquire LCAI tokens at an entry price that analysts predict could skyrocket as the platform gains adoption. Why Solana May No Longer Be the Best Bet Solana has been a shining star in the crypto world, earning a reputation for high-speed transactions and low fees. But as the market evolves, so does the competition. While Solana has focused on financial applications, its broader utility faces challenges from newer projects like Lightchain AI, which addresses entirely new markets by combining blockchain with AI. Here’s why some analysts believe Solana might lose its edge: Limited Innovation: Solana’s core value proposition—fast transactions—has been matched or surpassed by other projects. It lacks the unique integrations, like AI, that Lightchain AI offers. Scalability Bottlenecks: As Solana grows, its network has faced periodic outages and congestion, highlighting potential limitations in its scalability. Shifting Market Trends: Investors and developers are increasingly drawn to projects with real-world applications beyond finance. Lightchain AI’s ability to facilitate decentralized AI development places it at the forefront of this shift. While Solana’s current market cap and adoption are impressive, the search for the next Ethereum or Solana has led traders to explore innovative, early-stage projects like Lightchain AI. Why a $375 Investment in Lightchain AI Could Outpace Solana Imagine the potential of buying into a project like Solana at its early stages, when tokens were worth mere cents. Now consider Lightchain AI, a project that combines AI’s explosive growth with blockchain’s transparency and security. The current presale pricing offers investors a rare opportunity to enter at the ground floor, with predictions of substantial returns as adoption accelerates. Here’s why Lightchain AI offers unparalleled potential: Massive Market Alignment: The integration of AI and blockchain addresses two of the fastest-growing industries, creating immense demand for Lightchain AI’s solutions. Early-Stage Pricing: During its presale, LCAI tokens are priced significantly below their anticipated post-launch value, creating an opportunity for exponential gains. Real-World Applications: From healthcare to logistics, Lightchain AI’s decentralized framework solves problems that centralized AI systems struggle to address. For just $375, you could position yourself to benefit from Lightchain AI’s rapid growth trajectory. With analysts projecting gains that rival the early days of Ethereum and Solana, this hidden gem might be the most lucrative opportunity in crypto today. Lightchain AI or Solana? While Solana remains a strong player in the crypto market, the landscape is evolving, and so are investor priorities. Lightchain AI is emerging as a true innovator, addressing new markets and delivering the kind of technological breakthroughs that the crypto space needs.

37209553,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=106528,1733317403,Nike’s RTFKT to Cease Operations by January 2025: A Pivotal Moment for Digital Fashion and NFTs,"The End of RTFKT and Its Industry Impact Nike’s trailblazing RTFKT NFT project , which seamlessly combined digital fashion with blockchain technology, has announced it will cease operations by January 2025. The announcement, made via RTFKT’s official X (formerly Twitter) account, has left many in the crypto, fashion, and tech industries wondering about the implications for Nike’s broader Web3 strategy. Since its acquisition by Nike in December 2021, RTFKT (pronounced “artifact”) has been at the forefront of innovation in digital collectibles , offering products ranging from Clone X NFTs to virtual sneakers. This decision marks a significant moment in the evolution of digital fashion, raising questions about the sustainability of standalone NFT ventures and the future of Nike’s Web3 ambitions. RTFKT’s Journey: A Revolutionary Digital Brand 1. Founding and Early Success Founded in 2020: RTFKT was created by Benoit Pagotto, Steven Vasilev, and Chris Le, with the vision of merging art, gaming, and blockchain technology. Virality and Success: The company gained traction with its viral NFT drops, including collaborations with artists and brands that redefined how digital and physical assets intersect. 2. Nike Acquisition: A Bold Move into Web3 December 2021 Acquisition: Nike acquired RTFKT as part of its strategy to enter the burgeoning NFT and metaverse markets. Innovative Products: RTFKT launched iconic projects like Clone X , a collection of profile picture (PFP) NFTs, and exclusive virtual sneaker drops that bridged digital and physical worlds. 3. Pioneering Digital Fashion Augmented Reality and Gaming Integration: RTFKT leveraged AR and gaming platforms to create immersive experiences, pushing the boundaries of digital ownership and interactivity. Community Building: The brand fostered a strong community of enthusiasts, positioning itself as a leader in the Web3 space. Why Is RTFKT Shutting Down? Although the official announcement did not provide a detailed explanation for the closure, several underlying factors likely influenced Nike’s decision. 1. Declining NFT Market Conditions Market Contraction: The NFT market has faced declining sales and reduced investor interest since its peak in 2021. Sustainability Challenges: Many projects have struggled to maintain relevance and deliver consistent value to their communities. 2. Strategic Realignment by Nike Focus on Core Brands: Nike may be refocusing its Web3 efforts on integrating NFT and blockchain capabilities directly into its main brand. Cost Efficiency: Managing a separate entity like RTFKT can be resource-intensive, prompting a shift toward streamlined operations. 3. Shifting Consumer Preferences Utility-Driven Demand: Consumers and investors are increasingly favoring NFTs with tangible utility over speculative collectibles. Competition in Digital Fashion: The rise of competitors and alternative digital platforms has created a crowded market, making it harder for standalone NFT projects to stand out. RTFKT’s Legacy in the NFT and Fashion Industries Despite its closure, RTFKT leaves behind a rich legacy of innovation and creativity. 1. Redefining Digital Ownership RTFKT’s products allowed users to own, trade, and showcase digital assets in ways that were previously unimaginable. 2. Driving Mainstream Adoption By partnering with Nike, RTFKT introduced NFTs and digital fashion to a broader audience, bridging the gap between niche communities and mainstream consumers. 3. Influence on Digital Fashion RTFKT set a precedent for how brands can merge digital and physical fashion, inspiring other companies to explore the possibilities of blockchain technology. Community and Industry Reactions 1. Sentiment Among RTFKT Enthusiasts Disappointment and Uncertainty: The announcement has left RTFKT’s loyal community concerned about the future of their digital assets, including Clone X NFTs and virtual sneakers. Calls for Transparency: Collectors are seeking clarity on whether their NFTs will retain value and functionality post-closure. 2. Industry Perspectives Broader Implications: RTFKT’s closure underscores the challenges of sustaining standalone NFT projects in a volatile market. Opportunities for Competitors: Other digital fashion brands and platforms may capitalize on the vacuum left by RTFKT’s exit. What This Means for Nike’s Web3 Strategy Nike’s decision to shut down RTFKT does not necessarily indicate a retreat from Web3. Instead, it may reflect a strategic pivot toward more integrated digital experiences. 1. Integration with Nike’s Main Brand Nike NFTs: Future NFT initiatives could be directly tied to Nike’s core offerings, such as loyalty programs or product launches. Enhanced Utility: Nike may focus on creating NFTs with clear real-world benefits, such as exclusive merchandise access or membership perks. 2. Emphasis on Long-Term Value Shift Toward Utility: The closure signals Nike’s commitment to aligning its Web3 projects with consumer expectations for utility and long-term value. Sustainability Over Hype: By moving away from speculative assets, Nike could strengthen its reputation in the digital space. Lessons Learned from RTFKT’s Closure The journey and eventual closure of RTFKT offer important insights for the NFT and digital fashion industries. 1. The Need for Sustainability Successful NFT projects must deliver consistent value to their communities, moving beyond one-off hype cycles. 2. Aligning with Consumer Needs Projects that prioritize utility, interoperability, and tangible benefits are more likely to succeed in the evolving market. 3. Adapting to Market Trends As the NFT landscape matures, brands must remain agile and responsive to changes in consumer behavior and technology. Future of Digital Fashion and NFTs RTFKT’s closure marks the end of an era but also opens the door to new possibilities in digital fashion and blockchain technology. 1. The Rise of Utility-Driven NFTs NFTs with real-world applications, such as event access, loyalty rewards, and product authentication, are likely to dominate the next phase of the market. 2. Metaverse Integration Digital fashion remains a key component of metaverse ecosystems, with opportunities for immersive experiences and personalized avatars. 3. Collaboration Between Brands and Platforms Partnerships between traditional fashion brands and digital platforms could drive innovation and expand the reach of NFTs. What’s Next for RTFKT Collectors? 1. Value of Existing Assets Secondary Market Activity: RTFKT NFTs may see increased trading activity as collectors speculate on their long-term worth. Historical Significance: The brand’s iconic products could gain status as collector’s items, preserving their value over time. 2. Support from Nike Nike may continue to support existing RTFKT assets by maintaining their smart contracts and interoperability within other platforms. 3. Opportunities in New Platforms Collectors could explore cross-platform opportunities, leveraging their RTFKT assets in other blockchain ecosystems. Conclusion: RTFKT’s End, But Not the End of Innovation The closure of RTFKT by January 2025 represents a significant shift in Nike’s approach to Web3 and digital fashion. While the decision reflects challenges in the NFT market, it also underscores the need for sustainability, utility, and alignment with consumer expectations. As the NFT space evolves, the lessons from RTFKT’s journey will inform future innovations in digital collectibles and blockchain-based experiences. For Nike, this marks the beginning of a new chapter in its exploration of Web3 technologies, with the potential to create more integrated and impactful digital solutions.

Despite recent gains, Dogecoin has lagged in the ongoing bull run. Its closest rivals, like BNB and Solana, have broken their all-time highs from the last bull season, while Dogecoin has largely consolidated in the $0.40 range.Meanwhile, analysts are increasingly projecting the end of Dogecoin’s ongoing consolidation phase. In a recent post , analyst Professor Astrones highlighted a timeline for when he expects Dogecoin to reach between $3 and $5. Dogecoin impending breakout chart by Professor Astrones Timeline for Dogecoin to Hit $3 to $5Astrones first emphasized that $1 is his most immediate projection for Dogecoin, which he believes will happen faster than many imagine. From there, he expects higher levels to follow more easily. Specifically, according to Astrones, after breaking $1, Dogecoin could trade between $3 and $5 ""very easily"" by next year.Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.4221, with a 2% gain over the past day. The meme coin's price needs to grow by 610% to reach $3 and 1,082% to hit $5. According to Professor Astrones, the drivers of this projected Dogecoin rally will be the profits market participants are currently enjoying from XRP.XRP Money to Flow into Dogecoin XRP's price has doubled over the past seven days. With this action, investors holding XRP for the last 30 days are seeing a massive 422% profit.Amid XRP's explosive rally, Dogecoin has largely remained stagnant, hovering around the $0.40 price range. This has allowed XRP to surpass Dogecoin in market cap, now commanding more than double Dogecoin's valuation.Analysts now project that XRP's bullish momentum may soon fade , similar to Dogecoin's previous performance, creating an opportunity for the meme coin to regain dominance.Dogecoin Mirroring XRP PatternInterestingly, other analysts, like Jacob Canfield, have drawn similarities between the candlestick patterns of XRP and Dogecoin. Canfield observed that Dogecoin's current movement closely resembles that of XRP on shorter time frames. His analysis revealed the formation of higher lows, with Dogecoin maintaining previous resistance levels as new support. This pattern points to the possibility of continued upward momentum.When Dogecoin Will Trigger a Meme Coin FrenzyIn a different analysis, Rekt Capital highlighted the formation of a daily ascending triangle for Dogecoin. The chart illustrates Dogecoin breaking out of the pattern with horizontal resistance above $0.4368.Rekt Capital noted that a daily close above $0.43 is crucial for DOGE to validate the breakout, which took place shortly after. Meanwhile, he noted that a dip from this point would merely be a post-breakout retest.

Lightchain Protocol AI (LCAI) is being dubbed the ultimate Shiba Inu rival, offering not just the potential for explosive returns but also cutting-edge utility in the blockchain space. With predictions that a $750 investment could grow to $17,000 in less than two months, the Lightchain AI presale is gaining momentum as one of the best crypto opportunities of 2024. Lightchain AI: The Future of AI and Blockchain Integration Unlike Shiba Inu and other memecoins that rely heavily on community hype, Lightchain AI is a project built on innovation and real-world applications. As the first blockchain to fully integrate artificial intelligence (AI) tasks into its ecosystem, Lightchain AI is setting new standards for scalability, transparency, and utility. Here’s what makes Lightchain AI a standout project: Proof of Intelligence (PoI): A revolutionary consensus mechanism that rewards meaningful AI computations, such as machine learning model training and data analysis, rather than relying on traditional mining or staking. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): A state-of-the-art virtual machine that enables seamless deployment and execution of AI workloads on the blockchain. Decentralized Governance: Token holders influence the platform’s development through on-chain voting, ensuring fairness and transparency. Privacy and Security: Advanced technologies like Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and federated learning ensure sensitive data remains private while supporting collaborative AI development. These features position Lightchain AI not just as a rival to Shiba Inu but as a leader in the evolution of blockchain technology. The Case for Massive Gains Shiba Inu made waves by turning modest investments into fortunes, but many analysts now see Lightchain AI as the next big opportunity. With its presale pricing offering LCAI tokens at a fraction of their anticipated value, early investors could see exponential returns as the project gains traction. Here’s why Lightchain AI has the potential to deliver such extraordinary growth: Utility and Innovation: While Shiba Inu relies on community-driven momentum, Lightchain AI provides real-world solutions that appeal to developers, enterprises, and investors. High Demand Potential: The intersection of blockchain and AI is a rapidly growing market, and Lightchain AI is perfectly positioned to capture significant adoption. Presale Advantage: Early access to LCAI tokens ensures that investors can benefit from the project’s growth before it hits broader markets. Limited Token Supply: A capped supply creates scarcity, driving up value as demand increases. Imagine the potential of a $750 stake growing to $17,000 as Lightchain AI gains recognition as the go-to platform for decentralized AI. How Lightchain AI Stands Out in a Crowded Market The cryptocurrency market is filled with tokens promising the moon, but Lightchain AI differentiates itself with practical applications and innovative technology. Here’s how it compares to Shiba Inu: Real-World Utility: Shiba Inu has built its brand as a memecoin, while Lightchain AI focuses on solving real-world challenges in AI and blockchain integration. Sustainability: PoI and AIVM systems ensure that Lightchain AI’s network contributes to global AI advancements, making it more than just a speculative asset. Long-Term Vision: While Shiba Inu relies on community-driven spikes, Lightchain AI’s roadmap is grounded in sustained growth through enterprise adoption and developer engagement. For investors looking for both short-term gains and long-term viability, Lightchain AI offers the best of both worlds. The Practical Applications Driving Demand Lightchain AI isn’t just a token—it’s a platform designed to power decentralized solutions across industries. Some key applications include: Healthcare: Securely analyzing patient data for improved outcomes without compromising privacy. Finance: Providing AI-driven insights for fraud detection, credit scoring, and investment strategies. Supply Chain: Optimizing logistics and enhancing transparency with decentralized AI tools. AI Marketplaces: Enabling businesses and developers to buy and sell AI services directly within the ecosystem. These real-world use cases ensure sustained demand for LCAI tokens, making it a robust investment option. Why Act Now? The Lightchain AI presale is your chance to get in early on a project that combines innovation, scalability, and explosive growth potential. With analysts predicting returns as high as $17,000 from a $750 investment, the opportunity to maximize gains is now. While Shiba Inu captured the imaginations of early adopters, Lightchain AI offers the utility and vision to deliver both immediate and long-term value. The crypto world moves quickly, and this hidden gem won’t stay under the radar for long. Shiba Inu may have set the stage, but Lightchain AI is ready to steal the show. With its groundbreaking approach to blockchain and AI integration, this is a project that promises to redefine the industry—and deliver extraordinary returns for early investors. Don’t wait—join the Lightchain AI presale today and secure your position in what could be the next big crypto success story.

Table of Contents Not just another meme coin Game on Numbers that make sense Learning from the past Why now? What’s different Conclusion All eyes are turning to a fresh face in crypto that’s got market watchers buzzing. Yeti Ouro has stormed onto the scene at $0.012, with analysts drawing bold comparisons to Shiba Inu and Dogecoin’s legendary rises. But this time, there’s more than just meme magic at play. Not just another meme coin While YETIO might give off meme coin vibes at first glance, it’s packing some serious heat under the hood. Unlike its predecessors, this project’s real utility is baked in a high-octane racing game called Yeti Go that’s turning heads in the P2E space. G ame on Built on Unreal Engine 5, Yeti Go isn’t your typical crypto game. Players duke it out in intense races, pulling off wild moves and earning real rewards. It’s the kind of game folks would play even without the crypto angle; the earnings are just icing on the cake. Numbers that make sense Here’s what’s got investors intrigued: YETIO’s starting price sits at a modest $0.012, but some bold predictions see it climbing as high as $0.42. With a hard cap of 1 billion tokens and a 5% burn rate, basic supply and demand suggests these numbers aren’t just pie in the sky. L earning from the past Shiba Inu and Dogecoin wrote the playbook on community-driven success, but YETIO’s adding its own chapters. While those coins rode purely on hype, YETIO’s backing it up with an actual product people want to use. W hy now? The timing couldn’t be better. The P2E gaming sector’s heating up, and YETIO’s positioned right where the action is. With the presale gaining momentum, early birds are already circling – just like they did in the early days of SHIB and DOGE. What’s different Most new coins promise the moon but deliver empty space. YETIO’s different – it’s already got a working game in development, a clear roadmap, and tokenomics that actually make sense. The 5% burn mechanism means every transaction makes remaining tokens just a bit more scarce. Conclusion History’s shown us that catching the right project early can make all the difference. While SHIB and DOGE had their moment with meme magic, YETIO’s bringing both the buzz and the backbone of real utility. With Yeti Go’s development hitting new milestones and the presale picking up steam, smart money’s paying attention.

37211119,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/former-celsius-ceo-alex-mashinsky-pleads-guilty-to-two-fraud-counts,1733317027,Former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky Pleads Guilty To Two Fraud Counts,"Alex Mashinsky, the founder and former CEO of failed cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius Network, pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud. Mashinsky will be sentenced in April and could face decades in prison. Mashinsky was indicted on July 13, 2023, on seven counts of fraud, conspiracy, and market manipulation charges. Mashinsky Pleads Guilty According to federal prosecutors in Manhattan, Mashinsky misled Celsius customers, persuaded them to invest, and artificially inflated the value of his firm's proprietary token. During a hearing before US District Judge John Koeltl, Mashinsky said he pleaded guilty to two out of the seven counts he was initially charged with in 2023: commodities fraud and a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the price of the CEL token and secretly sell it at inflated prices, pocketing $48 million. Mashinsky also admitted to giving Celsius customers false hope by stating in an interview that Celsius had regulatory approval for its “Earn” program, which it did not. Celsius’ Earn program allowed customers to deposit their assets and earn yield through investments. Mashinsky also failed to disclose he had been selling his CEL tokens. The former CEO stated in court, “I accept full responsibility for my actions. I know what I did was wrong, and I want to try to do whatever I can to make it right.” As part of a plea deal with prosecutors, Mashinsky agreed not to appeal any sentence of 30 years or less, the maximum he currently faces. The former Celsius CEO will be sentenced on April 8, 2025. Significant Gains Federal prosecutors stated that Mashinsky made millions, accumulating $42 million in proceeds from selling his CEL tokens, leaving customers in the lurch when the firm went bankrupt. Damian Williams, the US Attorney in Manhattan, stated, “Mashinsky made tens of millions of dollars selling his own CEL at artificially high prices, while his customers were left holding the bag when the company went bankrupt.” Williams said Mashinsky orchestrated one of the biggest frauds in crypto as Celsius grew to a valuation of $25 billion at its peak and became one of the largest crypto platforms in the world. He also used catchy slogans like “unbank yourself” to entice customers with the promise that their funds will be as safe in a crypto account as they would in a bank account. Meanwhile, Mashinsky and his co-conspirators used customer deposits to fund purchases of the CEL token and bump up its price. Before pleading guilty, Mashinsky was scheduled for trial on January 28. Following the hearing, Mashinsky’s defense lawyer stated, “Sometimes, accepting responsibility when and where appropriate is the best way to help everybody move on.” The Celsius Bankruptcy Celsius was founded in 2017 and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2022 after customers rushed to withdraw their deposits as crypto prices crashed. The company exited bankruptcy in January and pivoted to Bitcoin mining. The firm grew rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic, promising customers easy access to loans and significant interest rates to depositors, and then lent the tokens to institutional investors, hoping to pocket the difference. Mashinsky was one of many figures from the crypto ecosystem to be charged with fraud following a collapse in crypto prices, causing several major firms, including FTX, to collapse.

A 3,000% surge would place #VET near Fib… https://t.co/b3MDjpRb40 pic.twitter.com/rfXasVxlim — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 3, 2024 Recent Performance Highlights VeChain experienced a remarkable 40% price increase within the first three days of December. This surge builds on its strong performance in November, where the asset rallied by over 110%, earning its place as one of the month’s top-performing cryptocurrencies. Despite a slight pullback from a recent multi-year high, VET has held above the $0.06 price level, strengthening analysts’ bullish outlook. VeChain’s Bullish Transition EGRAG’s optimistic forecast is based on patterns in VeChain’s historical price movements, which appear to be repeating in its current market cycle. He identifies the asset as being in a bullish phase, as indicated by a breakout from a long-term descending channel last year. This breakout, known as a Break of Structure (BOS), marked a significant shift in market momentum, breaking previous resistance levels. Following the breakout, VET surged to a high of $0.055 in February 2024 before undergoing a significant 65% retracement, falling to $0.01890 in August 2024. EGRAG notes that this sharp decline aligns with similar retracements in VeChain’s past market cycles, often followed by substantial rallies. Since the August low, VET has rebounded strongly, reaching $0.0720 earlier this month, its highest point in two years. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Fibonacci Levels and Future Targets EGRAG has outlined several key Fibonacci levels as potential price targets for VeChain. Currently trading at approximately $0.06605, the asset has surpassed its first target at the 0.5 Fibonacci level ($0.06021). The next milestones include the 0.702 Fibonacci level at $0.11147 and the 1.0 level at $0.27651. The most ambitious projections focus on Fibonacci extensions, with the 1.272 level at $0.63 and the 1.618 level at $1.58. EGRAG emphasizes that a 3,000% increase from current levels would bring VET near the $0.63 mark, a price that aligns with the 1.272 Fibonacci extension. Factors Supporting VeChain’s Growth Several developments underpin VeChain’s (VET) bullish outlook. Its inclusion in Coinbase’s COIN50 Index has increased its visibility among institutional and retail investors, enhancing its market presence. Additionally, VeChain continues to expand its real-world applications, particularly in supply chain management, where it has established itself as a leader. These factors and the platform’s growing partnerships, add to its long-term value proposition. With the ongoing rally and market sentiment aligning with historical trends, analysts remain optimistic about VeChain’s prospects. The potential for a 3,000% surge underscores its appeal as one of the most promising assets in the cryptocurrency space.

With buyers keeping the market price floating above the $0.40 mark, the chances of a bullish trend have significantly increased. With the broader market bounce back, the DOGE coin could witness a surge beyond the $0.50 psychological mark. So, will the biggest meme coin surpass this psychological barrier? Let’s find out in our latest DOGE coin price analysis. Dogecoin Price Analysis In the 4-hour chart, the DOGE price action showcases a triangle pattern formation. This consolidation within the two converging trend lines comes after a massive overrun. Over the past 30 days, the DOGE price action has given substantial returns, driving the memecoin rally. The bullish rally now accounts for a price surge of nearly 175% over the last 30 days. Tradingview Currently, the DOGE price action showcases a bounce back from the support trend line, creating two consecutive bullish candles. However, the DOGE price struggles to surpass the 50% Fibonacci level at $0.423. With a pullback of 1.04% over the last 4 hours, the supply pressure and the crucial Fibonacci resistance keep the bullish growth under check. However, the short-lived recovery rally resulted in a merger of the MACD and signal lines. With this, the indicator prepares for a bullish crossover if the uptrend survives. The 50% Fibonacci level breakout will challenge the overhead resistance trendline, attempting to break the triangle pattern. Dogecoin Targets $0.50 Breakout.

Two of these are Rexas Finance (RXS) and Dogecoin (DOGE) which are turning heads at the moment with the former being the best suited for investment for those seeking quick gains as well as long-term value. Cardano’s impressive price movement earlier this year cemented its status as a leading blockchain platform, showcasing the potential for well-positioned cryptocurrencies to deliver substantial returns. This same trader’s new predictions are creating excitement around Rexas Finance and Dogecoin, two projects with distinct approaches but immense promise in their respective niches. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Meme Coin That Refuses to Fade Away Almost right from the start, Dogecoin’s community has been the strongest - being the first noteworthy meme coin. Dogecoin harnessed the ability to draw a diverse audience and develop new use cases, evolving from a simple meme to an effective player in the crypto world, in large part due to Elon Musk's support. With the current speed and trend, the expectation of Dogecoin going to $1 looks as bright as it has ever been now. Dogecoin, however, relies heavily on the condition of the market and third-party authentication, hence it is considered a risky investment but it has high potential returns. For investors seeking a more robust foundation and transformative utility, Rexas Finance stands out as a game-changing option. Rexas Finance (RXS): Bridging Real Assets with Blockchain Innovation Rexas Finance (RXS) is transforming the cryptocurrency sector by focusing on Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization. Unlike many speculative enterprises, Rexas Finance offers a realistic solution to a growing demand: making high-value, usually non-liquid assets such as real estate and fine art available to ordinary investors. RXS allows fractional ownership, which opens doors to options formerly reserved for giant institutions or the ultra-wealthy Currently priced at just $0.125 in its ninth presale stage, RXS offers an attractive entry point. The presale has raised an already impressive $21 million, with $290 million worth of tokens sold already, which proves early supporters have Good faith. Currently, RXS is preparing to list its token for $0.2; those who join at this stage can expect a good return on investment. RXS is an ERC-20 token and runs on Ethereum’s network, thereby taking advantage of the scalability and security of one of the most reputed blockchains in the world. One of Rexas Finance’s most innovative features is its dual offerings: the Rexas Launchpad and Token Builder. These tools allow developers and businesses to tokenize assets and launch blockchain projects efficiently. This ecosystem positions RXS as more than just a cryptocurrency. It’s vital to the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. To add even more credibility to the project, it has undergone a CertiK audit, the leading standard for security and transparency within the crypto industry. Furthermore, inclusion within the listings of coinmarketcap.com and coingecko.com has improved its visibility and legitimacy to investors. For those looking for even more incentives to jump in, Rexas Finance is running a $1 million giveaway. Twenty winners will each get $50,000 worth of RXS tokens, adding interest for the newcomers. Rexas Finance permits a utility, as opposed to Dogecoin, which exists solely on the hype of the community. Investors are weighing their options as these two tokens approach the $1 mark. Dogecoin, while fun and accessible, remains highly volatile and dependent on external factors. Rexas Finance, on the other hand, is built on a foundation of practical utility and long-term growth potential. Anyone aiming to take advantage of the next opportunity in crypto should consider Rexas Finance. In an ever-more-crowded marketplace, Rexas is a good investment choice because it has a fantastic vision, is well-supported by the community, and has strong fundamentals. Conclusion While both RXS and DOGE have the potential to hit $1, Rexas Finance offers a clearer path to sustainable growth. With its innovative approach to RWA tokenization and its focus on creating real value for investors, RXS is positioned not just as the next big thing but as a cornerstone of the future of decentralized finance.

With Grayscale filing the 19b-4 form to turn its Solana Trust into an ETF, the market sentiments for Solana have significantly improved. Will this result in a new all-time high in SOL prices? Let’s find out in our latest SOL Price Analysis article. Solana Price Performance In the 4-hour chart, the Solana price action showcases the bullish struggle to sustain dominance above a long-coming resistance trendline. With a double-bottom reversal from a crucial support zone of $223. Further, it took a lower price rejection from the 200 EMA. Tradingview With triple consecutive bullish candles, it forms the triple white-shoulder pattern. However, the higher-price action has kept the bullish growth under check below $240. Currently, the SOL token price is at $237.33 with an intraday gain of 1.37%. Despite the higher price rejection, the Solana price action showcases a potential post-retest reversal from the broken resistance trendline. Solana Technicals and Price Targets The MACD and Signal line align positively with the recent crossover amid the recovery rally. This also comes with a surge in positive histograms. Furthermore, the 20 EMA line prepares a bullish crossover with the 100 EMA line in the 4-hour chart. Thus, the technical indicators are giving a buy signal for Solana. In this case, the uptrend is likely to challenge the current all-time high level of $264.60 by the end of this week. This increases the chances of a new all-time high at $280. On the flip side, a bullish failure to sustain dominance above the broken trendline and the 50 EMA line at $235 will likely gain us the $223 support zone.

Courtesy of the continued inflows, the total holdings have now exceeded one million BTC, according to data from SoSoValue . Asset managers of these ETFs currently oversee $104.25 billion in net assets, roughly equivalent to 1,076,610 BTC—close to the 1.1 million BTC believed to belong to Bitcoin’s enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. BlackRock’s Fund Dominates Inflows BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) dominated the day’s inflows, attracting $693.25 million in capital. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund followed, securing $52.17 million. Despite the overall positive trend, ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) experienced $93.5 million in outflows on the same day. Meanwhile, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF reported no net changes in asset flows, continuing to hold approximately $20.6 billion. This pales compared to IBIT’s commanding $48.5 billion. November proved to be a record-breaking month for Bitcoin ETFs, with $7.6 billion in net inflows. Market analysts attribute this surge to multiple factors, including shifting political dynamics. Just in **Bitcoin & Ethereum Spot-ETF Flows – December 3, 2024** Yesterday saw a significant influx into Bitcoin Spot ETFs, with net inflows reaching $676 million, equating to around 7,050 BTC.

Bitcoin ETFs See $6.4 Billion in Inflows in November November was a historic month for Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, with investors pouring $6.4 billion into spot BTC ETFs. The surge in inflows coincided with a month-long rally that saw Bitcoin’s price soar by 45%, reaching an all-time high of $99,000. Data from Farside Investors revealed that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF dominated the inflows, accounting for $5.6 billion, or nearly 87% of the total. Other major contributors included Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, which attracted $962 million, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF with $211.5 million, and the VanEck Bitcoin ETF at $71.2 million. The bullish momentum was driven by strong market sentiment, with Bitcoin’s price climbing from $68,000 at the start of November to its record-breaking peak.

Rival Altcoin Yeti Ouro Presale Raises $895,000 In Stage 1","XRP has recently gained significant attention after a sharp price increase, with many analysts forecasting higher targets. At the same time, a new rival altcoin, Yeti Ouro (YETIO), has been making waves in the market. The presale for Yeti Ouro has already raised over $895,000, attracting investors looking for promising opportunities. As XRP continues its upward momentum, many are questioning whether it will hit the $5 mark in the coming weeks. XRP Price Surge: From $2 to New Heights? The price of XRP has risen significantly in the last month to get back to trading above $2 . Some analysts have become more optimistic again after the most recent price rise, with forecasts from modest to highly aggressive. The Thinking Crypto Podcast host Tony Edward has been more conservative in his estimate and believes XRP could potentially go between $5 and $8 in the current cycle. He stated that while a slight overshot above $8 could be expected, the range he provided is a sensible forecast for XRP in the short-term future. However, there are still some market participants who are skeptical about the growth of the market. Edward was critical of the more aggressive targets, saying that he believed $589 or $1000 per XRP was out of the question. He said that although XRP has shown immense growth, getting to such heights would be quite unbelievable. Yeti Ouro Presale: A Rising Contender in the Altcoin Space While people are paying attention to the XRP token, there is a new competitor on the market called Yeti Ouro. As the new MemeFi token, which is built on the interaction between DeFi and meme culture, the project is steadily growing in popularity. Within Yeti Ouro, users will be able to engage in a play-to-earn racing game, perform staking, and provide deflationary mechanics intended for the hold of tokens in the long term. Yeti Ouro has already garnered over $895,000 in its Stage 1 presale. The investors are positive about the project and many of them expect that it will rise by 100% during the presale. As a meme coin, Yeti Ouro has chosen to embrace the community and utility-based model that has seen other tokens like Dogecoin rise to fame. So far, presale has almost reached $1 million, and experts are interested in how it will develop in the next few months. Yeti Ouro's Utility-Focused Approach Unlike most meme coins that are based on a popular trend, Yeti Ouro has a purpose to serve through its token. Tasks that can be performed within the P2E game Yeti Go include using the YETIO token to join races, make winnings, and buy the games’ assets. It also pays staking rewards to the holders of the coin to encourage them to hodl. Yeti Ouro developers have cooperated with popular game asset contributors, and at the moment they are polishing the gameplay mechanics and the overall game design. Another factor that made it different from other altcoins was the deflationary mechanics of Yeti Ouro. The number of tokens will never exceed one billion, and the project assigned 5% of the tokens for burning, which means that the total number of tokens will gradually decrease, and therefore; the value for the investors will increase.

On December 3, sources revealed that the company had reduced its workforce by 27%, affecting both U.S.-based employees and a portion of its team in India. The move comes as Foundry’s parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), prepares to spin off Foundry’s self-mining business into a standalone entity, while retaining control. Foundry confirmed the restructuring in a statement, noting the decision was aimed at doubling down on its core business of operating the leading Bitcoin mining pool and expanding site operations. DCG’s Spinout Strategy DCG disclosed in a November shareholder letter that the self-mining arm of Foundry is projected to generate nearly $80 million in sales by 2024. The spinoff, designed to operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of DCG, aims to bring external hires onboard and attract capital investments. Foundry USA currently accounts for around one-third of the global market share among Bitcoin mining pool operators, according to data from Hashrate Index. Despite the layoffs, the company remains optimistic about its future, underscoring the spinoff as a strategic step to enhance the performance and autonomy of its mining enterprise. “We believe this enterprise will be stronger as a standalone business,” DCG noted, highlighting plans to raise capital and bring in new expertise to ensure continued growth. Industry Pressures The restructuring highlights broader challenges facing the Bitcoin mining industry as operators adapt to changing market conditions. With the network’s halving event in April , which halved the number of BTC rewards per block, mining operations are grappling with rising costs and increased competition. According to CoinShares’ Q3 mining report, the sector has seen varied outcomes as miners roll out new infrastructure and prepare for anticipated price hikes.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Credible Crypto tells his 443,500 followers on the social media platform X that payments-focused crypto asset XRP could surge more than 65% from its current value. Credible Crypto practices the Elliott Wave theory, an advanced technical analysis approach that tries to predict future price action by following crowd psychology that tends to manifest in waves. According to the theory, a bullish asset goes through five major waves with each wave having its own five sub-waves. “It was indeed the start of a larger move to the upside. At this point it looks like we are already well within our third sub-wave now (green structure), with the second sub-wave being short and sweet (red box). First sub-wave of the larger third sub-wave looks to be complete but we have two more waves within this third sub-wave to go, which should smash prior all-time high. People already calling tops on XRP, but in my opinion, I think we are just getting warmed up. The ascent is going to be pure mania.” Source: Credible Crypto/X Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests that XRP may soon hit $4.21. The analyst also suggests that XRP has formed a bullish flag pattern on the monthly chart. In technical analysis, a bull flag is viewed as a continuation pattern, indicating that an asset is consolidating and gearing up for a fresh rally. “Eight-four months of sideways price action on XRP erased in a single, monthly candle.

The daily active address (DAA) suggests the overall health of the platform by indicating the number of users contacting the platform regardless of whether they intend to perform a buy, sell, or swap trade. The rise in levels suggests an increase in trading activity, which in turn impacts the volatility of the token. This indicates the price could remain elevated regardless of the selling pressure mounted over the markets. What’s next? When will the ALGO price reach $1? The ALGO price has broken the downtrend much before and appears to have ignited a strong ascending trend. The volumes have risen exceptionally well, reaching levels not visited in history. This suggests a massive rise in the trader’s interest in the token, which may keep the levels elevated regardless of the bearish pressures. Besides, the RSI has hit the highest level and hence may face a small pullback. Now that the Algorand price has already dropped from the high of around $0.61, an extended pullback may drag the levels slightly below $0.5. As the bullish momentum remains elevated, the ALGO price is expected to revamp a rebound and mark highs at $0.7 initially and later head towards $1.",POSITIVE,ALGO,ADA | ALGO | ALTCOIN | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/after-a-90-rise-algorand-is-unwinding-even-so-1-target-remains-activated-for-algo-price-rally/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37209169,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622464,1733316085,Bank of Korea Governor says interest rate cuts unlikely after unprecedented political unrest,"Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong believes the central bank is unlikely to lower interest rates because of the country’s recent political turmoil. He said the chaos caused by President Yoon Suk Yeol’s move to impose martial law on the country had little implications for South Korea’s economy. In an interview on Bloomberg TV, Rhee Chang-yong stated that the political event was “short-lived ” and that he didn’t see it as reason enough to change South Korea’s economic stance. “I think we can focus on the economy’s strengths and the weaknesses of the economy rather than political side effects,” Chang-yong remarked. His comments come after the South Korean parliament voted against President Yoon’s “premature” decison to declare martial law. Following Yoon’s announcement, the local currency and crypto markets plummeted to record lows, which the frenzy of mass liquidations and losses sending both local and foreign investors into a tailspin. Rate cut hopes rise as South Koreans call for Presidential impeachment President Yoon Suk Yeol’s decision to issue an emergency decree declaring martial law in South Korea quickly sparked intense political backlash. The majority of the country’s lawmakers, including members from Yoon’s own political party, saw his move as an overreach of executive power and nullified the declaration. Now, six opposition parties, with the support of residents, have reportedly united to formulate a motion for President Yoon’s impeachment. Analysts believe Yoon’s actions represent increasing risks as geopolitical tensions rise and global trade uncertainties loom. However, Governor Rhee Chang-yong expressed confidence that the country’s economic fundamentals are strong enough to weather the storm. “Economic dynamics in Korea can be separated from the political dynamics, given our strong market fundamentals and the mature democracy,” Rhee told Bloomberg. Governor Rhee acknowledged that the economic outlook is clouded by external factors, particularly the trade uncertainties accompanying President Trump’s return. That said, he emphasized that South Korea’s well-trained government officials have the tools necessary to navigate the current crisis, even though the exact path forward remains uncertain. As reported by Reuters, the Bank of Korea delivered an interest rate cut to 3.00% towards the end of November, marking the second consecutive reduction in as many meetings. While only four out of 38 economists polled by Reuters had predicted this rate cut, the bank’s seven-member board voted overwhelmingly in favor of easing monetary policy. This showcases the willingness of the central bank to support the economy during this period of uncertainty. Rhee further noted that three board members were open to the possibility of additional rate cuts in the next three months as the geopolitical risks from Donald Trump’s return to the Oval Office continue to cast a long shadow over the global trade landscape. He also stated that competition in exports with major countries was intensifying and that the Bank of Korea had taken note of the uncertainties surrounding the trade environment following Trump’s election victory. South Korea’s crypto tax bill postponed to 2027 In other news, South Korea’s financial regulators have decided to delay the implementation of the country’s crypto capital gains tax until 2027, pushing the deadline back by two years. The crypto tax will reportedly impose a 20% levy on profits from crypto trading for individuals earning at least 2.5 million won. Democratic Party floor leader KDP Park Chan-dae announced that the party had agreed to postpone the digital asset tax, which was initially set to take effect in January. The decision comes as debates continue over the proposal, originally put forward by the government and the ruling People’s Power Party (PPP). South Korea’s government had suggested a two-year grace period, while the PPP had pushed for a three-year delay. In addition to the crypto tax delay, Park mentioned that there is still room for negotiation on the 13 bills currently proposed by the government, including those concerning inheritance and gift taxes. He warned that if the government fails to act promptly, there would be a growing possibility for further reductions to the proposed tax to be done.

That said, the memecoin niche is the one to watch. Shiba Inu ($SHIB), ($DOGE) and ($BRETT) are among those leading the charge. $SHIB continues to take out the highs Source: TradingView $SHIB is looking good on the daily time frame. The price has broken up through the ascending trendline and has taken out all the highs except for the last local high at $0.0000407. If the price can get above the current resistance at $0.0000305, and consolidate above, the assault on the local high at $0.0000407 can begin. $DOGE building continuation pattern Source: TradingView On the weekly time frame for $DOGE, it can be seen that the price has been climbing a mountain over the last few weeks. It can also be noted how the price touched the 0.618 Fibonacci beautifully before being rejected. It looks like the $DOGE price is perhaps currently building a flag or some other continuation pattern. This might take some time to play out, but it then might be expected that the resistance will break, and the final climb to the all-time high at $0.74 can begin. $BRETT lays down price structure on top of support Source: TradingView $BRETT is nicely positioned according to the daily chart. The price perfectly reached the 0.5 Fibonacci before being rejected, but price structure looks to be being built above what has become support at $0.19.

Donald vs Israel (DONISRA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONISRA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Donald vs Israel can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald vs Israel could become the next viral memecoin. Donald vs Israel launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Donald vs Israel on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald vs Israel by entering its contract address – CKYA6Q1KcWsSJyXgFKwyNXyTAjHD1dRPKTDD2FTUFryn – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONISRA.

According to a report by South China Morning Post , co-founder and CEO Ben Zhou announced in a media briefing on Dec. 3 that the platform has no intentions of accepting China’s local currency. Though, he said Chinese citizens can access the platform to trade overseas or through VPN. “What the Chinese government dislikes the most about crypto is that it can facilitate capital outflow. So we won’t touch this red line,” said Zhou. Since June this year, Bybit allowed Chinese citizens to register on the platform with mainland China identity documents, including national IDs and passports. Though, Bybit still blocks Chinese IP addresses. At the time, the move was made in order to attract Chinese citizens who live overseas. Though now, Zhou said that people currently living in China can bypass the government’s ban on crypto by connecting to a VPN and using an IP address from a different region.

At the media briefing, it was revealed that Bybit saw 40 million new users joining the platform this year, boosting its user count to almost 60 million. The number went up nearly 300% compared to last year’s total registered users which was 20 million. In addition, Zhou also stated that the firm plans to reapply for a Hong Kong license in the first quarter of next year. Bybit previously applied for a Hong Kong license in January this year, but withdrew it in May. The Chinese government allowed Hong Kong to grow its crypto industry, but has maintained a ban on crypto trading in its mainland region since 2021. Though, the ban has not stopped Chinese traders from engaging in crypto trading activities in spite of the ban.

37208818,https://finbold.com/?p=216784,1733315654,"Analyst warns XRP’s gains are ‘not natural,’ labels it ‘pump and dump’","XRP has witnessed one of the most iconic price breakouts in the cryptocurrency market , but to one analyst, this momentum does not add up. Rajat Soni has questioned the legitimacy of XRP’s growth, describing it as ‘not natural’ and suggesting it could be part of a ‘ pump and dump ’ scheme, he said in a post on X on December 3. Soni highlighted XRP’s 435% surge since November 2 while pointing out its relatively modest 11% growth since 2018, which he called inconsistent. He argued that the price movements defy typical market trends and advised investors to approach the asset cautiously. “I find it crazy that so many people are messaging me about XRP. If you can’t see that this is a scam, you deserve to be scammed. The way that the price is rising is not natural. This is not how markets work. Seems like a pump and dump to me,” he said. Soni labels XRP a scam This is not the first time Soni has criticized XRP. In December 2023, he labeled the Ripple -affiliated asset a scam, accusing it of centralization. The financial educator claimed that Ripple Labs controls the XRP Ledger and a significant portion of the token supply, implying the company could manipulate the code or issue more tokens. It is worth noting that Ripple does not control the XRP Ledger, as changes require validator approval rather than unilateral decisions. XRP’s total supply is also capped at 100 billion tokens, which has remained unchanged since its pre-mining phase. In the same vein, Ripple regularly releases XRP from escrow to maintain liquidity, support partnerships, and fund operations. The December release is emerging to be one of the largest in 2024. Indeed, Soni, a vocal advocate for Bitcoin ( BTC ), has been at odds with the XRP community regarding his take on cryptocurrency in the past. Drivers of XRP’s rally XRP’s rally aligns with broader cryptocurrency market trends, buoyed by Donald Trump’s election victory , which is expected to usher in crypto-friendly policies. The resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler has also fueled optimism, as analysts suggest XRP’s previous consolidation stemmed from litigation by Gensler’s SEC against Ripple. Additionally, speculation about a potential XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) is driving investor confidence, with whales increasing their position in the asset. In this case, data from on-chain analytics platform Santiment revealed that whales accumulated 160 million XRP over the past weekend, valued at approximately $380 million. XRP whale buying activity.

You’re not alone. People often look back at missed opportunities and think, “Man, if only I’d known.” But here’s the thing—crypto never stops giving second chances, and today, that chance is staring you in the face with Qubetics ($TICS) . While AVAX proved to be a game-changer for early adopters, $TICS is stepping up to the plate with cutting-edge solutions that promise to rewrite the rules of blockchain and asset management. Unlike AVAX, which made its mark with scalability and DeFi dominance, Qubetics takes the game a step further, pioneering real-world asset tokenization. Think of it as the bridge between the old-school financial world and the future of blockchain. Ready to dive in? Let’s break it down. Avalanche (AVAX): The One That Got Away AVAX isn’t just another name in the crypto world—it’s a legend. Launched in September 2020, Avalanche promised what so many blockchains before it failed to deliver: speed, scalability, and eco-friendliness. And boy, did it deliver. Early investors who bought AVAX at under a dollar saw their portfolios skyrocket when it peaked at $146 in November 2021. That’s a mind-blowing ROI of over 14,500%. It was like hitting the crypto lottery. But let’s be real—who could’ve predicted Avalanche’s meteoric rise? Back then, blockchain was still finding its feet, and many dismissed AVAX as just another Ethereum wannabe. Fast forward to today, and Avalanche is a titan, with a thriving DeFi ecosystem and partnerships that keep rolling in. Most recently, the network announced integrations with major financial institutions, solidifying its position as a leader in enterprise blockchain adoption. If you missed out, it’s easy to feel the FOMO. But history loves to repeat itself, and Qubetics might just be your second shot at crypto greatness. Qubetics ($TICS): The Real-World Revolution Here’s where Qubetics comes into the picture, turning what seems like “just another crypto presale” into the next big thing. Unlike AVAX, which focuses on scalability and speed, Qubetics introduces Real-World Asset Tokenization (RWAT) . Imagine converting your house, car, or even a rare piece of art into digital tokens that can be traded on a blockchain. Sounds futuristic, right? Well, Qubetics is making it a reality. Let’s paint a picture. Say you own a small business—a cafe in New York, maybe. You’ve got valuable assets but struggle to secure funding from traditional lenders. With Qubetics’ platform, you could tokenize your equipment and leasehold rights, offering investors fractional ownership in exchange for much-needed capital. You get the cash to grow, and investors get a slice of your success. It doesn’t stop there. Imagine a farmer in Kansas tokenizing their equipment or a single mom in Seattle selling fractional ownership of her art collection to fund her kids’ education. Qubetics makes these scenarios not only possible but seamless. By using its TICS token, transactions become efficient, secure, and entirely on-chain, eliminating middlemen and slashing costs. And here’s the kicker: Qubetics is still in presale. Stage 11, to be exact. At just $0.0282 per token, the clock’s ticking. Over 261 million tokens have already been sold, raising more than $4.2 million from 5,900+ holders. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $1 post-presale, delivering a jaw-dropping 3,446% ROI. Those willing to play the long game could see $TICS soar to $15 after the mainnet launch—a staggering 53,091% ROI. Why Timing Is Everything Remember AVAX’s early days? Investors who got in during the presale made life-changing profits. Qubetics offers that same golden window. Investing $4,500 in $TICS today at $0.0282 could buy you about 159,574 tokens. If $TICS reaches $1 post-presale, that’s $159,574 sitting pretty in your wallet. At $5? You’re staring at $797,870. And if it hits $15? Let’s just say you might want to start planning your dream vacation—or early retirement. But here’s the thing: presale prices don’t last forever. Come this weekend, $TICS will jump 10%, making your entry costlier. Don’t be that person who hesitates only to regret it later. AVAX and $TICS: Same Game, Different League Both AVAX and Qubetics represent opportunities to change lives, but their approaches couldn’t be more different. While AVAX solved blockchain scalability, Qubetics is solving real-world problems. RWAT isn’t just a buzzword; it’s a revolution that could redefine industries from real estate to art to small business financing. The question isn’t whether Qubetics will succeed—it’s whether you’ll be part of its success story. The Takeaway: Don’t Miss Your Second Chance Crypto doesn’t wait for anyone. AVAX proved that the early bird catches the worm, and Qubetics is giving you a chance to be that bird. With its innovative approach to asset tokenization and the massive ROI potential, $TICS isn’t just another crypto—it’s a movement. Ready to make your move? The Qubetics presale won’t last forever, and neither will the chance to turn $4,500 into a fortune. Head over to the Qubetics presale page, grab your tokens, and secure your seat on this rocket ship before it’s too late. The only regret you’ll have is not buying more. Jump into the Qubetics presale now and secure your chance to ride the next big crypto wave. Don’t wait until you’re wishing you’d acted sooner!

37208648,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656691,1733315425,"If Dogecoin Mirrors Last Cycle, The Surge To $4 Begins At Week’s End","After a staggering rally exceeding 200% in the first two weeks of November, Dogecoin (DOGE) has entered a consolidation phase. Crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) suggests this could be the calm before the storm, hinting at a potential surge similar to a previous market cycle. Is Dogecoin Heading Towards $4? Kevin notes that in Dogecoin’s last cycle, the memecoin consolidated for 24 days after its first massive rally before ascending again to what he describes as the “macro golden pocket”—a price range between $3.80 and $4.00 which aligns with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level.He believes that if DOGE follows a similar trajectory, price could skyrocket by the end of the week, potentially leading to a new all-time high (ATH) by the end of the month. Related Reading: Dogecoin Alert: Why December 5 Is A Game-Changing Date For Price “In Dogecoin previous cycle when it had it’s first major leg up it consolidated for 24 days after that move before legging up again to the macro golden pocket. If DOGE were to follow a similar path that would mean that that the next leg will start by the end of the week and Doge will begin its path the macro golden pocket which is at $3.80-$4.00,” Kevin states. However, he tempers expectations by acknowledging that such astronomical performance is hard to predict: “That would be astronomical performance though and it’s hard to make that type of call. Let’s start with making a new ATH by end of month like I predicted back in September.” The current price position of Dogecoin is critical. Analyzing the daily DOGE/USD chart, Kevin observes that DOGE is “actively testing this major trend line of support on the daily RSI.” A breach of this support could “accelerate downside. Bulls wants this to hold if possible.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Keep Buying – DOGE Metrics Reveal Demand Remains Strong He adds that while the RSI trend line held on the daily close, “it needs to bounce now if we are going to hold it.” The influence of Bitcoin’s (BTC) price movement could be pivotal: “If BTC can leg up, it would save us,” he notes. Bitcoin itself has been consolidating since reaching a reported ATH of $99,588 on November 22, trading within a range of $90,800 to $98,500. Kevin describes a “tug of war between price action and this downward momentum on the indicators,” as the daily MACD shows increased downside momentum that the price isn’t reflecting. He emphasizes that “one of them is going to win eventually.” On the 4-hour BTC/USD chart, Kevin highlights a symmetrical triangle pattern nearing its apex, suggesting an imminent breakout. Despite recent volatility, “BTC still has not broken down or even closed a 4HR candle below this trend line,” indicating strong support levels. He also points out significant liquidation levels around $100,000, stating that “it’s only a matter of time before BTC decides to come up and take that liquidity at $100K.” Such a move by Bitcoin could herald the next major price surge for Dogecoin, aligning with the patterns observed in the last cycle. Kevin’s analysis suggests that the interplay between Bitcoin and Dogecoin prices remains a crucial factor in predicting the next market movements. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.4194.

37210056,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51288,1733315407,52k% ROI Looms: Qubetics ($TICS) Presale Thrives Amid Bitcoin Cash’s and Algorand’s Breakout,"What if the crypto revolution could finally solve real-world challenges with seamless, quantum-resistant technology? That’s the promise Qubetics ($TICS) brings to a bustling crypto market already energized by the dynamic performances of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Algorand (ALGO). The 2024 cryptocurrency scene has been nothing short of spectacular. Bitcoin Cash has soared over 100% this year, benefiting from Bitcoin’s rally and a favourable pro-crypto U.S. administration. Similarly, Algorand has captivated investors by breaking out of a prolonged lull, signalling a bullish momentum that could push it beyond $0.60 soon. But amidst these big moves, Qubetics is quietly stealing the show. This innovative blockchain isn’t just another token. With its live presale in its 11th stage, Qubetics has already sold 261 million tokens, raised $4.2 million, and amassed over 5,900 holders. At $0.0282 per $TICS token, the presale presents an irresistible opportunity before prices increase by 10% this weekend. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Blockchain is Here Qubetics is rewriting the rulebook. At its core lies a revolutionary concept: Real-World Asset Tokenization (RWAT) . Picture this: Businesses can tokenize physical assets like real estate or vehicles, turning them into digital tokens tradable on the blockchain. For individuals, it’s an easier way to access and trade high-value assets without middlemen. Professionals can streamline contracts, payments, and ownership transfers with unparalleled security and transparency. Qubetics doesn’t stop there. Its quantum-resistant blockchain ensures long-term security, safeguarding users against emerging threats. And with gasless transactions for $TICS tokens, it’s removing barriers to entry, making blockchain adoption effortless for everyone. The ongoing presale is creating buzz for all the right reasons. Investors who buy $TICS at $0.0282 in the 11th stage could see returns of 786% when the presale ends at $0.25 per token. Analysts predict the token could skyrocket to $1 after the presale, delivering a staggering 3,446% ROI. And here’s the kicker: $TICS could hit $15 after its mainnet launch, promising a jaw-dropping 52,912% ROI. Imagine investing $1,500 in the presale today. At $15 per token post-mainnet, that’s a potential windfall of $795,000. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Riding the Bitcoin Wave Bitcoin Cash has experienced a resurgence, riding on Bitcoin’s approach to the $100,000 mark. Its breakout from a falling wedge pattern has analysts predicting a potential 50% rally, with BCH possibly hitting $709 by the end of 2024. BCH’s strong correlation with Bitcoin, at 0.93, means it’s deeply intertwined with Bitcoin’s market movements. As Bitcoin thrives, so does BCH. The pro-crypto stance of the U.S. administration is another catalyst, with expectations of regulatory clarity fuelling optimism. For investors, BCH is proving to be a robust contender. It’s riding high on technical momentum and market sentiment, cementing its place as a favourite for those looking to ride the Bitcoin wave. Algorand (ALGO): The Underrated Contender Algorand has emerged as a beacon of innovation, leveraging its scalable blockchain to attract institutional and retail investors alike. Its recent surge—from $0.297 to $0.496—highlights the potential for further growth, especially with resistance near $0.50 weakening. What’s driving ALGO? Its focus on decentralised finance (DeFi) and enterprise adoption, coupled with its ability to handle high transaction volumes, positions it uniquely. Analysts predict ALGO could push towards $0.60 soon, making it a strong pick in an evolving crypto market. Why Qubetics Tops the Competition Unlike its predecessors, Qubetics solves critical blockchain challenges. Its proprietary Layer 1 solution enhances scalability and interoperability, eliminating data silos that hinder traditional blockchains. Its tokenomics, anchored by the $TICS utility token, fuel an ecosystem of decentralised applications, smart contracts, and asset tokenization. The 11th stage of the presale offers an exclusive chance to get in before the next 10% price surge this weekend. Early adopters stand to gain massive returns, with analysts touting $TICS as one of the most promising investments of 2024. Conclusion As Bitcoin Cash and Algorand energise the market, Qubetics is carving its niche as the go-to blockchain for real-world solutions. With its live presale offering unmatched ROI potential, now’s the time to act. Don’t wait. Dive into Qubetics today and seize the future of blockchain. Curious about what sets it apart? Check out this video to learn why $TICS is 2024’s most exciting crypto investment.

Uranium.io, built on the Tezos blockchain, aims to lower barriers to entry for retail investors, providing unprecedented access to a market previously limited to large-scale institutional players. The platform is launching in partnership with Curzon Uranium, a major uranium trading firm with over $1 billion in trades, and Archax, the United Kingdom’s first registered cryptocurrency exchange. Uranium Market to Benefit From Ledger Technology Traditionally, retail investors could only engage with uranium indirectly, such as through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Uranium.io changes this dynamic by introducing tokenized uranium assets. It’s official: tokenized uranium is available to trade now! Powered by @Tezos , @ArchaxEx , and Curzon, you have the opportunity to invest in physical uranium–U308—via our trading platform. Buy, own, and trade physical uranium: A direct and transparent way to invest in… pic.twitter.com/wgEGQ8H9SO — XU3O8 (@uranium_io) December 3, 2024 These assets, minted on an immutable blockchain ledger, are part of the growing real-world asset (RWA) tokenization trend, which enhances liquidity and accessibility for tangible and financial assets. Blockchain technology further simplifies participation by automating processes through smart contracts, eliminating the need for complex banking relationships and contractual frameworks. Uranium purchased via Uranium.io will be stored as physical Triuranium octoxide (U3O8) in a regulated depository managed by Cameco, a global leader in uranium supply. The launch of Uranium.io coincides with rising demand for uranium, fueled by the global shift toward nuclear energy as a low-emission alternative. Nuclear energy is gaining traction as industries like artificial intelligence increasingly require sustainable, high-capacity power solutions. Companies such as Microsoft are already exploring nuclear energy options, including plans to utilize reactivated reactors. Magic Integrates Etherlink to Enhance Tezos dApp Development In May, Magic partnered with Etherlink to boost Tezos dApp development with enhanced scalability and security. The integration was intended to simplify onboarding for blockchain users. By combining Etherlink’s scalability and security with Magic’s easy-to-use wallet SDK, the partnership seeks to improve the development of dApps on the Tezos blockchain.

ASIC proposed comprehensive updates to Information Sheet 225 regarding digital assets and financial products via a news release. ASIC commissioner stressed commitment to responsible innovation ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland emphasized the regulator’s commitment to creating responsible financial innovation while maintaining robust consumer protection measures. The proposed updates include 13 detailed practical examples showing how existing financial product definitions apply to digital assets and related products. The commissioner stressed that Australia’s financial services regulatory regime maintains a technology-neutral stance, with many digital assets and related products already falling under existing financial product categories. This approach aims to create consistency across traditional and digital financial markets while supporting innovation. ASIC’s focus areas The consultation paper seeks stakeholder input across several critical areas: &]:mt-2 list-decimal space-y-2 pl-8""> Updated guidance in INFO 225, including practical worked examples Application of existing AFS license processes to digital asset businesses Practical licensing considerations for wrapped tokens and stablecoins Potential regulatory relief measures Proposed transitional approaches for the implementation period ASIC has shown flexibility by proposing a class ‘no action’ position for digital asset businesses actively pursuing Australian Financial Services licenses, Australian Markets licenses, or Clearing and Settlement Facility licenses. It claims the approach acknowledges the industry’s need for adaptation time while maintaining regulatory oversight. The proposal builds upon Australia’s existing cryptocurrency regulatory framework, where the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) oversees compliance with anti-money laundering laws. AUSTRAC requires all cryptocurrency exchanges to register and implement comprehensive know-your-customer processes, creating a multi-layered regulatory approach to digital asset oversight.

The presale will take place in three rounds over a span of seven days, with a focus on supporting the project’s long-term development. The price of $CPNUT is fixed across each round at 0.000003 SOL, equating to $0.00072. The first round, which commenced on November 28, concluded at 14:00 UTC. During this round, 50 million CPNUT were allocated to investors, and they received a 100% reward bonus on tokens purchased. For the second round, 100 million CPNUT were allocated to investors. This round concluded in 48 hours, from November 29 to December 1 at 14:00 UTC. Early investors received a 50% bonus on whatever they bought. The third and final round kicked off on December 1, 2024. This round is scheduled to conclude in 96 hours (on December 5, 2024). Investors will receive an additional 10% on tokens purchased during this period. Each round offers a 15% referral reward for participants who invite others to join the presale with their referral link. Interested users can join the presale here: https://chillpnut.io/buy Step 1: Wallet Setup Investors begin by setting up a Solana-compatible wallet, such as Phantom, to generate a SOL address. The ChillPnut website provides a Dashboard where users can log in by entering their SOL address. Step 2: Funding the Wallet To participate in the presale, participants fund their wallets with SOL. SOL can be acquired through cryptocurrency exchanges if not already available. Step 3: Purchasing and Reserving CPNUT Within the Dashboard, participants can specify the amount of SOL intended for investment in the ChillPnut presale. The Dashboard calculates the number of CPNUT tokens associated with the entered amount. SOL is then transferred to the designated wallet address provided on the Dashboard. Once the transaction is confirmed, ChillPnut will reserve allocated tokens and airdrop before the Token Generation Event (TGE). A SOL address can be obtained using Solana-compatible wallets such as Phantom or Solflare. The total supply of CPNUT tokens is 1 billion. Of this supply, 50% is allocated for the presale, 25% for liquidity, 8% for airdrops, 10% for a centralized exchange (CEX) reserve, 5% for marketing efforts, and 2% for development initiatives. The presale event serves as a key milestone for the platform, providing an opportunity for early participants to support what aims to be an innovative development in the memecoin sector. Additionally, the ChillPnut Giveaway is active, targeting 5,000 SOL addresses with a distribution of 15,850 CPNUT (approximately $25) per address. Each referral equals 2,377 CPNUT (about $4). The current token price of $0.00072 marks the latest valuation for CPNUT. ChillPnut has announced its upcoming listing on Bitmart, a recognized cryptocurrency exchange, with additional plans to expand its availability to platforms such as KuCoin, Bybit, BingX, Huobi, Bitget, and OKX. About ChillPnut (CPNUT) The ChillPnut memecoin debuted on the Solana blockchain and rode the wave of the viral “Just A Chill PNUT” meme, gaining popularity on social media. ChillPnut is inspired by the viral story of Peanut, a pet squirrel euthanized by New York authorities. The CPNUT ecosystem may offer P2E aspects, but the token is primarily designed for entertainment.

The cryptocurrency is marginally up over the past 24 hours and is trading around the $96,500 mark, consolidating between $94,000 and $98,000. BTC’s trading volume is at $70 billion, but market dominance registered a marginal decline. Ethereum (ETH) also registered a marginal increase as it held above $3,600 after bouncing back from a low of $3,504. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) registered a sharp increase, rising almost 5% to$238 as it looks to overcome recent bearish sentiment. Several cryptocurrencies made substantial gains over the past 24 hours including Dogecoin (DOGE) , Tron (TRX) , Toncoin (TON), Avalanche (AVAX), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) . The crypto market cap continued to grow, registering an increase of 1.50% and moving to $3.54 trillion. South Korea’s Crisis Sparks $34B In Local Crypto Trades South Korean crypto exchanges registered over $34 billion in trading volume over the past 24 hours as the country’s president declared martial law, only to be forced to lift it by an overwhelming vote in parliament. The martial law lasted six hours. According to data from CoinMarketCap, South Korean exchanges, including Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopa,x recorded a combined crypto trading volume of $34.2 billion in 24 hours, with Upbit processing $27 billion worth of crypto transactions alone. The 24-hour trading volume also increased to record the highest single-day total for the year. The jump in crypto trading occurred after the country’s president, Yoon Suk-yoel, declared martial law late on Tuesday after stating he wanted to protect the country from threats to democracy posed by “anti-state” forces, primarily targeting the country’s primary left-wing opposition. As a result, South Korean crypto traders rushed to sell their crypto on local exchanges. The rush to sell caused BTC’s price on Upbit to drop to $62,182. Almost all major South Korean exchanges saw considerable price drops and experienced outages thanks to a spike in activity. Coinbase Integrates Apple Pay Coinbase has announced the integration of Apple Pay to facilitate seamless fiat-to-crypto transactions. The integration will make purchasing crypto easy and more accessible to millions of users by leveraging the ease and security of Apple Pay’s ecosystem. Coinbase announced the integration in a statement, stating, “Coinbase Onramp takes the hassle out of fiat-to-crypto conversions with lightweight KYC for eligible purchases, free USDC on and offramping, and access to the most popular payment methods.” Users can log in and purchase using Apple Pay on apps developed with Coinbase Onramp services. The integration eliminates manual card entries for external payment processors, a step usually required when funding Coinbase accounts. It also aligns with efforts to streamline user experiences while maintaining security. Onramp solutions could facilitate greater adoption by making it easy to conduct crypto transactions through Apple Pay, giving users a sense of security when interacting with blockchain, crypto, and Web3 solutions. MicroStrategy Can Ignore Bitcoin (BTC) Crash To $20,000 Research published by capital advisor Jeff Walton has stated that Bitcoin (BTC) could drop as low as $20,000 without significantly impacting MicroStrategy’s treasury, indicating the firm could survive an 80% drop in BTC’s value. MicroStrategy’s BTC exposure is higher than ever after the firm added more of the asset to its treasury. BTC has appreciated almost 40% in November, and Walton believes even a protracted correction would not have a significant impact on MicroStrategy, with the price needing to fall significantly lower. “The price of Bitcoin would need to fall to $18,826 in order for $MSTR’s assets to be worth less than their liabilities.” Adding BTC to company balance sheets has drawn considerable criticism since the asset has seen significant corrections previously. BTC crashed from $69,000 to as low as $15,600 between November 2021 and November 2022. However, Walton believes the argument against Bitcoin adoption carries very little weight. “As the price of Bitcoin rises, the financial leverage falls fast. For the ‘This will not end well’ / ‘Ponzi’ ‘pyramid scheme’ bears, run the math. The $MSTR balance sheet is arguably underutilized from a ‘leverage’ perspective.” Charles Edwards, the founder of quantitative Bitcoin and digital asset fund Capriole Investments, is equally bullish. Edwards stated in a post on X that MicroStrategy was just one player in the new institutional Bitcoin investment arena, arguing the market is not bullish enough on the outcome. “MSTR raising $B/week to deploy into Bitcoin. MARA currently boosting its holdings by 30% with a $1B raise. Absolutely insane institutional demand. 13.5% of all Bitcoin is now held by institutions and ETFs and it's going parabolic. It's wild how numb we all are to this now that it's the new normal. But this is the institutional adoption we were all dreaming about.” Is A New Bitcoin Soft Fork Brewing? Cobra, the owner and maintainer of the bitcoin.org domain, has issued an alert about the development of a user-activated soft fork for Bitcoin that unnamed developers outside the Bitcoin Core project could propose next year. “Some bitcoiners are going to attempt to soft fork in CTV through a UASF sometime in 2025. Not enough people are paying attention to this.” CTV, short for Check Template Verify, is a series of improvements that introduce the concept of covenants to Bitcoin. Covenants establish spending conditions for BTC stored in a determined wallet. CTV allows for developments that can enhance the security of Bitcoin transactions. One of these developments is vaults, cold storage addresses with a spending condition that forces users to send transactions to a single, predetermined wallet asset. Users can also cancel these transactions before a predetermined time, allowing them to cancel potentially malicious transactions. However, the biggest drawback of the update is linked to fungibility, as the BTC would be siloed in these addresses and be deemed less valuable. The update could also expose the codebase to attackers looking to take advantage of the update. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) fell to a low of $93,645 on Tuesday as it remained pinned under $100,000. The drop came after the market was rattled by news that the US government had moved a significant chunk of seized BTC to Coinbase. The cryptocurrency trades between $94,000 and $98,000 after failing to go above the $100,000 mark despite reaching an all-time high of $99,655. The asset fell marginally after the US government moved almost 20,000 BTC valued at $1.9 billion to Coinbase, sparking speculation about the motive. Transferring assets to an exchange typically happens before a sale. However, the move by the government may not necessarily herald a sale given Coinbase has a contract with the Justice Department’s US Marshals Service to provide custody services. The price chart shows BTC continuing to trade sideways as buyers struggle to build momentum for a move past $100,000. The cryptocurrency recorded substantial price action last week but has remained relatively muted this week, trading between $94,000 and $98,000. BTC fell back after setting a new all-time high of $99,655 and recorded a substantial drop at the beginning of last week when it dropped over 5% to $92,846. The price continued to decline on Tuesday, falling to a low of $90,708 before settling at $91,913. BTC made a strong recovery on Wednesday, rebounding to register an increase of 4.32% and settle at $95,883. However, buyers lost momentum on Thursday as BTC registered a marginal decline to settle at $95,690. The price recovered on Friday, registering an increase of almost 2% to climb above $97,000 and settle at $97,374. Source: TradingView BTC was back in the red on Saturday, starting the weekend with a drop of 1.14% to settle at $96,263 before recovering on Sunday to settle at $97,026 after an increase of 0.79%. The current week began with BTC in the red, facing considerable selling pressure and volatility. The price ultimately registered a drop of 1.25% and settled at $95,812. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as sellers dragged BTC to a low of $93,665. However, it recovered from this level to climb above $95,000 and settle at $95,751. The current session sees buyers back in control with BTC up almost 1% and trading around $96,650. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has made a strong recovery during the current session as buyers attempt to build momentum and push towards $4,000. ETH has faced considerable volatility since last week despite starting positively. ETH surged to an intraday high of $3,547 last Monday before settling at $3,415 after an increase of 1.60%. However, it fell back on Tuesday, dropping by almost 3% to $3,325. Despite the prevailing bearish sentiment, ETH recovered strongly on Wednesday, rising nearly 10% to go above $3,500 and settle at $3,657. Sellers were back in control on Thursday as ETH fell by 2.09% to $3,580 before registering a marginal recovery on Friday and moving to $3,594. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment intensified over the weekend as ETH registered an increase of over 3% to go above $3,700 and settle at $3,705. Despite facing considerable resistance at this level, ETH registered a marginal rise on Sunday to settle at $3,710. ETH fell back in the red on Monday as sellers drove the price down by almost 2%. As a result, ETH dropped to a low of $3,556 before settling at $3,645. ETH continued to drop on Tuesday, falling to a low of $3,503. However, with support building at this level, it recovered to climb above $3,600 and settle at $3,618.. ETH has made a strong recovery during the current session, with the price up almost 3% and trading at $3,719. If buyers can build momentum and keep ETH above $3,700, we could see a move to $4,000. However, if sellers retake control, ETH could drop to $3,500 or lower. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) had been facing considerable selling pressure since the previous weekend when it fell in the red after reaching a high of $264. With sellers in control, SOL registered a substantial drop at the beginning of the previous week, dropping 7.37% to $234. SOL briefly went below the 20-day SMA on Tuesday as sellers dragged it to a low of $222. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $230, registering a drop of 1.49%. SOL recovered on Wednesday, registering an increase of almost 5% and settling at $242. However, it was back in the red on Thursday as sellers took control, dropping nearly 2% to settle at $237. Despite registering a substantial drop on Thursday, SOL rose by 2.41% on Friday to settle at $243. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment intensified over the weekend as SOL dropped 233% on Saturday to settle at $237. Sellers attempted to drag SOL below the 20-day SMA on Sunday but were unsuccessful as the price registered only a marginal decline. However, it fell below the 20-day SMA on Monday as it registered a drop of almost 5% to slip below $230 and settle at $225. SOL recovered on Tuesday despite falling to a low of $215, registering an increase of almost 4% to settle at $234. Buyers have retained control during the current session, with the price up nearly 1% and trading at $236. Buyers will look to build momentum and push above the 20-day SMA.

Toncoin (TON) Price Analysis Toncoin (TON) has been trading positively since last Tuesday, going above key resistance levels despite significant volatility and selling pressure. TON faced significant volatility last Tuesday as buyers and sellers struggled to exert influence. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a marginal increase and settled at $6.14. TON went past the 200-day SMA on Wednesday after rising almost 4% and settling at $6.39. Volatility returned on Thursday as TON fell to an intraday low of $6.07 and reached an intraday high of $6.63 before settling at $6.42 after a marginal increase. Sellers attempted to drag TON below $6 on Friday as the price dropped to a low of $6.25. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $6.47.

APT ultimately registered a marginal increase to $13.38 but could not go above the resistance level. Volatility persisted on Sunday as APT inched above the resistance with a marginal increase and settled at $13.39. Sellers attempted to take control on Monday, driving APT to a low of $12.31.

37208008,https://crypto.news/?p=14316115,1733313938,"Pepe Unchained presale raises $65m as Ethereum ecosystem soars, ICO ends in 10 days","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Pepe Unchained is set to lift the meme coin space with its Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain, promising faster speeds, lower fees, and a thriving ecosystem—presale ends in 10 days. Table of Contents King of alts: Ethereum shows who’s boss Pepe Pump Pad lets anyone become a “dev” without coding Buy and track PEPU investments with Best Wallet Pepe Unchained (PEPU) is a viral presale cryptocurrency building the first Ethereum layer 2 blockchain dedicated solely to meme coins. Its fundraising campaign has enjoyed unprecedented success, raising over $65 million so far. Pepe Unchained promises 100x faster speeds and far cheaper fees than Ethereum, making it an optimal environment for trading meme coins. The project is seeing a considerable uptick in demand because the presale will end in ten days, after which PEPU will list on tier-1 exchanges. And the timing could not be better. After months of underperformance, the Ethereum ecosystem has finally started to gather pace and regain market share from Bitcoin and Solana. Pepe Unchained hopes to grab a big chunk of this new Ethereum-focused attention by posing as the ecosystem’s home for meme coins. https://twitter.com/pepe_unchained/status/1860730192559309219 King of alts: Ethereum shows who’s boss Ethereum – and by association, its ecosystem tokens – are decisively outperforming Solana and Bitcoin counterparts this week. On Layer 1 coins, ETH is in the lead, pumping 6.5%. BTC is up 1% in that window, while SOL is down 4.6%. It doesn’t end there. Ethereum projects are starting to flex their muscles again. Aave is up 73% this month and 3x from its late-summer lows. Ethereum Name Service is up 152% this month, and Ondo is up 159%. Ethereum-based meme coins have also started outperforming. Solana’s market-leading meme coins, Bonk and Dogwifhat, are down 1.7% and 2.4% this week, while Ethereum’s Shiba Inu and Pepe are up 17.9% and 6.9%. As mentioned, this presents the perfect environment for Pepe Unchained to launch. Pepe Unchained is not just another Ethereum meme coin. It will be the infrastructure on which the next generation of Ethereum-based “joke” tokens launch. The presale offers investors an opportunity to capitalize on this from the start. It might be the closest thing to buying Ethereum during its 2014 ICO. Pepe Pump Pad lets anyone become a “dev” without coding One of Pepe Unchained’s most prized features is Pepe Pump Pad, a Pepe Chain version of Pump.fun. Pepe Pump Pad allows anyone to launch a meme coin in two clicks and without coding. People launch thousands of tokens every day on Pump.fun, some of which spawn into the industry’s hottest projects, like Peanut the Squirrel and Moo Deng. Now the Ethereum ecosystem will have its own version in Pepe Pump Pad, enabled by Pepe Unchained’s improved transactional capabilities. With that, Pepe Unchained will be a vibrant ecosystem from the day it launches. It will also include features such as a block explorer, a dedicated Ethereum bridge, a decentralized exchange, and staking. So, it’s not surprising that analysts expect big returns once PEPU lists on exchanges. For instance, Jacob Bury told viewers of the 99Bitcoins YouTube channel that it could 100x. Buy and track PEPU investments with Best Wallet Pepe Unchained was recently featured on the trending Web3 wallet Best Wallet as its “token of the week.” Investors can buy PEPU at presale using the Best Wallet app or by connecting a different wallet to the Pepe Unchained presale website. Those who buy via Best Wallet can also track their tokens and receive real-time updates on the platform’s dashboard. https://twitter.com/BestWalletHQ/status/1854829917395206324 It’s worth noting that another project that appeared as Best Wallet’s “token of the week,” Catslap, soared over 50x after launching in November and also received a major investment from Jump Trading, a leading US-based money manager. Whether we’ll see the same story for Pepe Unchained remains to be seen. But there’s one thing for sure – the project is creating something we’ve never seen before. It’s certainly one to watch closely. With just ten days left until the ICO ends, prospective buyers should act quickly to not miss out.

Can the bullish flag breakout lead to a new all-time high beyond $4? As one of the rising altcoins in the crypto market over the past 24 hours, SUI has increased by 4.36%. With this price surge, the altcoin has reached a market cap of $10.99 billion.The SUI breakout rally is edging closer to a new all-time high above the $4 psychological milestone. Will the ongoing rally lead to an extension that crosses the $4 barrier? Let’s find out.SUI Price AnalysisOn the 4-hour chart, SUI's price surge surpasses the overhead trendline of a falling channel pattern. This falling channel has formed a bullish flag pattern, complementing the bull run.As a result, the SUI price action shows strong upward momentum, signaling a bullish flag breakout rally. The price broke past the overhead resistance trendline and faced resistance near the $3.64 mark, resulting in a minor pullback.However, after a successful post-test reversal, SUI's price has risen from $3.18 to $3.7417, representing a rally of 17.57%. Moreover, the breakout rally has moved above the $3.64 resistance level, which aligns with the 23.60% Fibonacci level. SUI Price Chart The SUI price action continues to show a post-test reversal from the Fibonacci resistance-turned-support level. The price is inching closer to its all-time high of $3.9433, forming higher highs.Additionally, the highest price coincides with the supply zone, which ranges from $3.89 to $3.95, just below the 38.20% Fibonacci level. Therefore, the ongoing breakout rally is approaching a critical resistance zone.The breakout rally has also caused an uptick in the 50-SMA line, which is on the verge of crossing over the 100-SMA. Furthermore, the 4-hour RSI has risen near the overbought boundary, indicating increased underlying buying pressure. As a result, technical indicators suggest a boost in buying pressure, increasing the likelihood of reaching a new all-time high.SUI Price TargetsUsing the trend-based Fibonacci levels, in case of a breakout rally above the 38.20% mark, the immediate resistance levels are at $4.467. Hence, the upside potential in SUI this week is nearly 20%. On the flip side, the dynamic support from the 50-SMA line at $3.45 and the 200-SMA line near the $3.00 psychological mark are likely to absorb any increase in supply.",POSITIVE,SUI,ALTCOIN | MARKET | TRADING | SUI,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/04/sui-price-eyes-new-all-time-high-with-flag-breakout-rally/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=sui-price-eyes-new-all-time-high-with-flag-breakout-rally,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

37207945,https://crypto.news/?p=14315605,1733313780,Blockchain and smart contracts revolutionize urban development | Opinion,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. In today’s urban landscape, cities are increasingly under pressure to become smarter, more efficient, and more sustainable. As municipalities and private developers look for innovative ways to optimize urban management, blockchain technology is stepping up as a pivotal tool. While traditionally associated with cryptocurrencies, blockchain’s potential goes far beyond finance, offering transformative possibilities in how cities are managed and operated. You might also like: Streamlining sustainability with decentralized data | Opinion According to Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch, the global smart city market is expected to reach $1.29 trillion by 2025. Leading cities like Singapore and Dubai have already begun leveraging blockchain to enhance services like mobility, energy management, and data transparency. These advancements are not just futuristic ambitions but practical solutions aimed at optimizing urban efficiency and resource allocation. Smart contracts: Automating urban operations One of the most impactful applications of blockchain in urban development lies in smart contracts. These self-executing agreements, where terms are directly encoded into software, can automate complex urban processes such as procurement, maintenance, and even energy distribution. For example, using smart contracts to manage solar power distribution between households can optimize energy usage while cutting down costs. Dubai’s investment of $300 million in blockchain initiatives exemplifies how smart contracts can streamline city operations. The city aims to integrate blockchain across all government services, potentially reducing administrative overhead and accelerating project timelines, with an estimated savings of up to 20% in operational costs by 2030. Ensuring transparency and data integrity A significant challenge in urban development is ensuring data accuracy and transparency. Traditional systems often involve multiple layers of intermediaries, leading to delays, data silos, and potential inaccuracies. Blockchain technology offers a solution by providing a decentralized ledger where all data entries are verified, timestamped, and immutable. For instance, city administrations can use blockchain to enhance procurement processes. Tracking transactions—from project bids to contract awards—on a transparent ledger reduces the risk of fraud while improving accountability. Additionally, blockchain’s cryptographic security can protect sensitive data like property records and environmental metrics, which is crucial as cities move toward interconnected smart infrastructure. Empowering citizen engagement Beyond optimizing city management, blockchain can also enhance citizen engagement. By implementing blockchain-based platforms, cities can facilitate secure and anonymous voting on public consultations, referendums, or community projects. This fosters greater transparency and encourages civic participation. In Chicago, for example, blockchain is being explored for waste management optimization. By using this technology to track waste collection schedules, the city ensures efficient allocation of resources. Residents can access real-time updates, leading to improved accountability and better services. Advancing sustainable development with real-time data As cities strive to meet ambitious sustainability goals, having access to real-time, accurate data is critical. By integrating blockchain with IoT sensors, city planners can gain actionable insights into key areas such as air quality, energy consumption, and water usage. This data can inform policies that drive sustainability and efficiency. In the GCC, where sustainability is a top priority, the green building market is projected to surpass $66 billion by 2029. Blockchain’s ability to securely capture and share vast amounts of data can help cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi meet their net-zero targets. For example, automating energy distribution through smart contracts can help reduce waste and emissions, contributing to more sustainable urban environments. Navigating the future of blockchain in urban development While the benefits of blockchain in urban development are becoming clearer, it’s essential to recognize that the technology isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. Successful implementation requires strategic planning, ensuring that blockchain systems are compatible with existing urban infrastructure and regulations. Educating stakeholders about the advantages of blockchain will also be crucial in driving adoption. However, the momentum for blockchain adoption in urban management is already strong. Platforms like DownTown—which is already being utilized in cities like London and Dallas—are creating scalable frameworks that municipalities can leverage to enhance urban services. As blockchain technology continues to mature, its potential to optimize urban management will only grow, making cities more adaptive, efficient, and better interconnected. The future of urban development lies in leveraging the power of blockchain and smart contracts to build cities that are not only smarter but also more sustainable and efficient. By automating operations, ensuring data integrity, and enhancing citizen engagement, blockchain can unlock new possibilities for better urban management. For cities worldwide, the message is clear: embracing blockchain isn’t just about keeping up with technological trends but about preparing urban spaces for the challenges of tomorrow.

Expanding to TON could help GraFun capture newer audiences, tap into higher liquidity for meme issuances and increase the platform’s visibility among crypto traders.  “Creating and trading memecoins directly inside Telegram, one of the most popular messaging apps in the world, is almost here,” a GraFun developer told CoinDesk over Telegram message. “After launching 14k memecoins and generating more than $450M in trading volume on BNB Chain, GraFun is now making memecoin creation simple and fast inside Telegram.”  TON holds over $350 million worth of user assets across various platforms based on the blockchain, data shows.  A source close to the team shared plans for a GraFun token in the future based on user activity in a message to CoinDesk, although GraFun developers neither confirmed nor denied plans.  GraFun uniquely offers a “Fair Curve” model that developers say minimizes rug-pull risks, reduces price manipulation and ensures fairer token issuances that result in fewer users losing money. Memecoin behemoth Floki owns over 40% of GraFun, and other backers include DWF Labs.  The most popular examples of memecoin launchpads that use a “Fair Curve” model are Pump on Solana - which pioneered such a model - and Tron’s Sun Pump.",POSITIVE,BNB | TON,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING | BNB | TON,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/04/grafun-expands-to-ton-network-to-enable-memecoin-creation-right-in-telegram,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/04708226a905d2d21ad69209274869bf3a3f5bd3-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42389542,63370dc4-a851-4c08-8d40-6547c39594ad,1733313600,Crypto Daybook Americas: DeFi Carry Trade Takes Root and Dino Coins Reemerge,"By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)  It was only a matter of time before the bitcoin bull market reignited excitement in the DeFi sector, and guess what? Chatter is heating up about a potential “carry trade” that uses DeFi protocol Ethena's yield-bearing staked USDe (sUSDe) to borrow stablecoins like USDC and USDT from the lending giant Aave.  Those stablecoins are then flipped back for USDe, yielding a sweet return from the juicy spread between sUSDe's near 30% annualized yield and AAVE's variable borrowing rates, currently less than 20%. The return is way better than ether's staking yield of under 4% and the U.S. 10-year Treasury's 4.24%.  If the trade becomes popular, the arbitrage window could eventually close, with borrowing rates potentially matching the yield on sUSDe, according to the pseudonymous observer Clouted. Keep an eye on this one.  As for market leader bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency has bounced back to nearly $97,000 as of writing — a level we've seen several times since mid-November — after testing dip demand around $93,500 on Tuesday. Prices on Korean exchanges are back in sync with their global counterparts after Tuesday's flash crash caused by the announcement of martial law.   Traders are eagerly awaiting Fed Chairman Powell's speech later today, plus Friday's nonfarms payroll report, hoping for a boost in bitcoin price volatility. With BTC's Coinbase premium returning, the case for renewed bullishness looks promising unless Powell throws cold water on December rate-cut expectations.  Meantime, beware of engagement farming on social media. Some X accounts are buzzing about record short positions in CME's ether futures, claiming it's suppressing ether prices. That might not be so. Most of those shorts could be a part of the popular price-neutral cash-and-carry arbitrage strategy that includes long positions in the spot market or spot ETFs. It's no coincidence that Farside Investors data shows there's been a net inflow of $714 million into U.S.-listed ether ETFs in the past seven trading days.  Looking at the broader market, Aptos has hit a milestone with its DeFi total value locked surpassing $1 billion, a staggering 19-fold growth year-on-year. The number of transactions and the average cost to transact on the Avalanche C-Chain are at their highest since April and August, just as the Avalanche9000 upgrade approaches, according to data source Artemis.  Tron's TRX token and the on-chain perpetual options protocol GammaSwap's GS token have reached record highs, while a whale sold a whopping 240 billion PEPE, according to Lookonchain data. Decentralized exchange PancakeSwap has launched ""PancakeSwap Springboard"" to create and list tokens, taking the page out of Pumpfun's book. Expect more speculative froth.  In traditional markets, keep your eye on risk-off signals. The yen remains upbeat and Wall Street executives are aggressively reducing their stocks, driving the ratio of insider sellers to buyers to nearly 6x, according to the Kobeissi Letter.

Several tokens popularized back during what was arguably the first altcoin bull market are following XRP's 400% price rally over the past 30 days with rallies of their own for no immediately apparent reason.  Stellar (XLM), bitcoin cash, eos (EOS), tron (TRX) and Hedera (HBAR) have gained at least 50% over the past week, CoinGecko data shows, in a move that has outperformed bitcoin and nearly every ""new"" token that is being promoted or hyped on Crypto Twitter.  The term ""dino coins"" reflects a narrative shift where older cryptocurrencies are no longer seen as outdated but as resilient, seasoned projects. This shift can be attributed to their survival through multiple market cycles, which gives them a certain credibility among newer, less-proven offerings.  Derivatives Positioning  The bitcoin and ether annualized three-month futures basis on offshore exchanges remain flat at around 15%. On the CME, ETH boasts a slightly higher basis at 17%, with BTC at 14%, offering attractive returns to cash and carry traders.  Positioning in ETH remains elevated, with global futures and perpetual open interest at a record high of 338,680. The BTC market has cooled, with open interest pulling back to 609,470, down 8% from the peak of 663,710 seen last month.  On decentralized options protocol Derive, a trader collected $1.66 million in premiums by selling bitcoin March expiry calls at strikes in the $105,000 to $130,000 range.  Short-term BTC calls are trading at a slight discount to puts, but long-term options continue to show a bull bias. ETH calls are expensive relative to puts across the curve.

The journey of meme coins began with the creation of Dogecoin (DOGE) in 2013. The continuous growth and popularity of Dogecoin, backed by its strong community and widespread adoption, have cleared the roads for new entrants aiming to replicate its success. One such innovative project is Yeti Ouro (YETIO), a fresh utility meme coin that combines the meme coin ecosystem with functionality, gaming, and much more. Dogecoin News: The Original Meme Coin Pioneer Dogecoin is credited with kickstarting the meme coin craze. Originally created as a playful alternative to Bitcoin, Dogecoin quickly gained a large community, especially through its strong social media presence and widespread attention. Its success was accelerated further by endorsements from celebrities like Elon Musk and billionaire Mark Cuban. The Dogecoin price has grown remarkably since its creation, proving that a coin that began as a joke can make waves in the global financial industry. However, Dogecoin has its limitations. Since it has an unlimited supply, scarcity is absent, which compromises its long-term value proposition. Discussions about its future performance are ongoing, with most Dogecoin price predictions pointing to moderate increases as adoption grows on payment platforms. The increasing number of stores accepting Dogecoin as a payment method is a positive sign, but questions remain about its sustainability. Nevertheless, Dogecoin continues to inspire other meme coins seeking to replicate its success. For crypto enthusiasts exploring newer options with added features, Yeti Ouro offers a unique alternative for investors. Yeti Ouro: A Meme Coin With Real Utility Borrowing from its big brother, Dogecoin, Yeti Ouro is demonstrating that a meme coin can be more than fun by integrating utility. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this hot new utility meme coin features Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming through its flagship game, Yeti Go. Unlike Dogecoin, Yeti Ouro has a capped supply of 1 billion tokens, making it a scarce asset and an attractive option for long-term investors. While DOGE is designed for micropayments and everyday use, YETIO is designed for long-term value. Yeti Ouro’s P2E racing game, Yeti Go, offers high-risk, adrenaline-pumping gameplay for crypto enthusiasts and gamers. Built using the Unreal Engine, the game delivers a high-quality, fun experience that allows players to earn YETIO tokens during competitive player-versus-player races. Features like destructible PvP mechanics, power-ups, and environmental challenges set Yeti Go apart from other crypto-based games. Its unique offers and designs show that it is designed by gamers for gamers. The development team has recently shared a viral behind-the-scenes video showing the ongoing work. Beyond gaming, Yeti Ouro’s smart tokenomics ensure sustainable growth while rewarding its community. Key features include allocating 15% of tokens to Play-to-Earn rewards and a token-burning mechanism to maintain scarcity, solidifying Yeti Ouro as a top rival for the next 100x meme coin.

Solana developer Trent Sol, who first sounded the alarm, described the compromised versions as a “secret stealer” capable of leaking private keys through seemingly legitimate CloudFlare headers. anyone using @solana/web3.js, versions 1.95.6 and 1.95.7 are compromised with a secret stealer leaking private keys. if you or your product are using these versions, upgrade to 1.95.8 (1.95.5 is unaffected) if you run a service that can blacklist addresses, do your thing with… — trent.sol (@trentdotsol) December 3, 2024 He urged developers and projects to immediately upgrade to version 1.95.8 or roll back to unaffected version 1.95.5. Despite these vulnerabilities, major projects such as Drift , Solflare , and Phantom confirmed their immunity, either due to avoiding the impacted versions or deploying additional security layers. Drift is not affected by this vulnerability. The Drift codebase does not have dependency on the two compromised ""@solana/web3.js"" releases. https://t.co/0EbicREB7W — Drift (@DriftProtocol) December 3, 2024 Solflare is not impacted by the recent issue with @solana/web3.js. We enforce version locking and conduct rigorous code reviews, both manual and automated, to protect against supply-chain attacks. Your keys remain safe and secure with Solflare. https://t.co/0jIdYzV1Kn — Solflare – The Solana Wallet (@solflare_wallet) December 3, 2024 The Bug in Solana Web3.js Library: Who Is Affected? According to a Socket.dev post , a supply chain attack compromised the Solana/web3.js library, a core component for developers building on Solana. This type of attack, targeting dependencies widely used by developers, inserted a backdoor function named addToQueue into versions 1.95.6 and 1.95.7. The malicious function enabled the exfiltration of private keys by disguising its activity as legitimate CloudFlare header data. Once captured, these keys were transmitted to a hardcoded Solana wallet address identified as FnvLGtucz4E1ppJHRTev6Qv4X7g8Pw6WPStHCcbAKbfx. Cybersecurity researchers, including Christophe Tafani-Dereeper from Datadog, analyzed the malicious versions and highlighted the sophisticated nature of the exploit. They discovered that the domain used for the operation (sol-rpc[.]xyz) had been registered on November 22, just days before the attack became public. The domain was hosted behind CloudFlare, with the command-and-control (C2) server now offline. This timeline points to a carefully planned attack, likely due to a phishing or social engineering campaign targeting the library’s maintainers. The npm package manager, which hosts Solana/web3.js, swiftly removed the compromised versions. Developers using the affected versions were advised to update version 1.95.8 immediately or audit their projects for suspicious dependencies. Broader Implications for Solana and Web3 Security The Solana ecosystem has responded rapidly to mitigate the fallout. In addition to Phantom, major projects like Backpack have assured their users that the exploit does not affect them. No @Backpack wallets were affected by this. Stay safe. https://t.co/xkpFQZJTjn — Armani Ferrante (@armaniferrante) December 4, 2024 Supply chain attacks like this have become increasingly common as malicious actors target the tools and libraries developers rely on. Earlier this year, a similar attack involved a malicious Python package named “Solana-py,” which masqueraded as a legitimate API to steal wallet keys. Similarly, in October this year, the Checkmarx threat research team uncovered a new malware campaign on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository, targeting cryptocurrency users through a malicious package named “CryptoAITools.” The malware masquerades itself as a legitimate cryptocurrency trading tool and uses a deceptive graphical user interface to distract victims while executing malicious activities on Windows and macOS systems. Once installed, the malware launches a sophisticated multi-stage infection process, downloading additional components from a fake website and stealing sensitive data such as wallet recovery phrases, saved passwords, browsing history, and even Apple Notes on macOS. Beyond the initial infection through PyPI, the campaign extends to other platforms, employing multiple social engineering tactics to lure victims.

Woori Technology Investment, a South Korean venture capital firm, is reportedly planning to sell its nine-year stake in Dunamu, the parent company of crypto exchange Upbit , local media outlet Bloter has learned . While the exact sale price has not been disclosed, discussions suggest it could exceed the current market value of shares traded on the over-the-counter market, with an expected return of around 100 times or more.

As of Q3 this year, the book value of the stake is reported at 593.9 billion KRW, 108 times the original investment, the report notes. The firm is reportedly considering attracting international investors, as it faces challenges in raising funds from domestic investors due to regulatory restrictions. The decision to sell follows shortly after a failed coup attempt in South Korea, where the country’s president, Yoon Suk Yeol, declared martial law in response to accusations of pro-North Korean sentiment among parliament members.

Shortly after its launch, BNB’s price reached a record high of $782. Multichain DEX protocol PancakeSwap recently introduced PancakeSwap ( CAKE ) Springboard to the public on Dec. 4. According to the protocol’s blogpost, PancakeSwap Springboard is a platform that enables users to create and launch tokens on BNB Chain. PancakeSwap Springboard could usher in a new wave of BNB Chain meme coins , similar to how meme coin launch platform pump.fun brought upon the Solana hype through meme coins launched on its site. Shortly after the launch of PancakeSwap Springboard, Binance Coin ( BNB ) surged by more than 20% in the past 24 hours, reaching a record high price of $782, according to data from crypto.news .

All the user has to do is establish the project’s name, ticker and basic settings. PancakeSwap SpringBoard also claimed that it does not charge a launch fee for projects on the platform. “Whether you’re building a meme coin, a community-driven project, or a DeFi project, SpringBoard simplifies the process with just a few clicks, from token creation to liquidity setup,” the protocol wrote. However, the protocol will still incur a 1% trading fee, with a minimum fee of 0.001 BNB once the token is succesfully on the market. There is also a seeding fee which amounts to 2% of the token’s liquidity before migrating to PancakeSwap. The blogpost stipulates that 50% of the seeding fee goes to the token creator, while the other 50% goes to PancakeSwap SpringBoard. The protocol also provides users with the option of choosing from multiple tokens for trading pairs and liquidity pools, including Binance Coin, USDT ( USDT ) and PancakeSwap’s token. Once a token’s liquidity reaches 100% of the bonding curve on SpringBoard which equates to 24 BNB, all its minted tokens will be automatically paired on PancakeSwap DEX to establish liquidity. Tokens that meet specific criteria will have their liquidity pools boosted with CAKE based on organic trading volume through what the protocol calls the SpringBoard Farm Program. The Farm Program is meant to drive liquidity, community engagement, and exposure to a user’s project on the SpringBoard ecosystem.

Similarly, the altcoin offers early investors unmatched gains of 39,305% returns by January 2025. Bitcoin bullish run: $120,000 mark in the horizon In the last month, Bitcoin excited investors as it hit an all-time high on Nov 22. However, the bitcoin price has retreated since then, but substantial gains have been made towards the ATH. Bitcoin’s price was $96,529 at press time, jumping by 6.5% in the last week. Bitcoin continues to break the resistance level, which shows its resilience as a market leader. Similarly, the performance of Bitcoin has drawn attention to altcoins, with investors looking for new projects with strong growth potential.

PropiChain’s advantage lies in its real utility, achieved using blockchain, NFTs, AI, and the Metaverse to disrupt the trillion-dollar industry. PropiChain’s outstanding feature is the property tokenization, which enables fractional property ownership. This means that investors can access high-value properties by buying shares of premium real estate with a lower financial burden. Using the power of AI, investors can use AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants to offer support during asset acquisition. Similarly, they provide real-time support and guidance, such as filtering suggestions based on user’s preferences. In addition, the AI chatbots simplify complex financial paperwork and help investors understand legal contracts. PropiChain’s Metaverse integration takes real estate investments to another level. It offers virtual property tours and immersive 3D experiences. Using the Propiverse, investors can tour properties from anywhere in the world from their homes. It breaks traditional real estate accessibility barriers, as investors don’t have to physically tour a potential investment property. Again, PropiChain automates lease management using smart contracts, thus ensuring tamper-proof, transparent and binding agreements. In addition, investors will not need intermediaries that reduce paperwork and facilitate the easy execution of the agreements upon agreed terms and conditions. PropiChain’s BlockAudit certification shows the platform’s commitment to a secure and reliable user experience. Similarly, this has also contributed to the growing interest in the PropiChain altcoin. Again, PropiChain’s recent listing on CoinMarketCap boosts investor confidence in the platform. Its listing signals that it has met high standards of integrity and security. Consequently, investors are flocking to the presale to be part of this altcoin. This milestone shows that the best is yet to come. PropiChain presale: Limited opportunity for 39,305% ROI Analysts predict that the Bitcoin price is yet to see better days as it’s expected to rise to $120k. With the Bitcoin rally boosting market confidence, the hype around PropiChain builds up as the next big opportunity by offering a blockchain solution in the lucrative real estate industry. PropiChain presale price is the lowest it will ever be, with the altcoin priced at $0.004, offering early investors a golden opportunity to maximize returns. Currently, 43.86% of the tokens have been sold in the first round, raising over $615k. If you invest $1,000 in the presale stage, it will be worth $394,050 after the predicted gain of 39,305%.

37207206,https://coinpedia.org/?p=389113,1733312207,Tron (TRX) Soars 66% in 24 Hours: Is This the Next XRP?,"The post Tron (TRX) Soars 66% in 24 Hours: Is This the Next XRP? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Tron (TRX) has seen an impressive 66% surge in the last 24 hours, reaching $0.44 before settling slightly lower at $0.39. This sharp rise has placed TRX among the top-performing altcoins, drawing comparisons to Ripple (XRP), which recently soared 300%. So, what’s fueling this remarkable rally? Record-Breaking Revenue and Justin Sun’s Vision The surge in TRX’s price comes alongside a massive increase in trading volume, exceeding $14 billion—an unmistakable sign of growing investor interest. A major factor behind the rally is Tron’s founder, Justin Sun, who recently compared TRX to XRP and called it the “XRP of 2025,” sparking enthusiasm in the crypto space. TRX=XRP — H.E. Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) December 3, 2024 On December 3, Tron set a new record by generating $20 million in revenue in a single day, which significantly boosted market confidence. Sun has also made bold claims that 2025 will be “the year of crypto,” pointing to improving regulations, growing adoption of digital currencies, and more favorable market conditions. Additionally, Sun envisions Tron as a leader in cross-border payments, aiming to compete with Ripple’s XRP, which has made significant progress in this area. A $30 Million Investment to Expand Tron’s Reach In another strategic move, Sun announced a $30 million investment in Donald Trump’s World Liberty Finance. This partnership is expected to strengthen Tron’s influence in decentralized finance (DeFi) by bridging the gap between traditional finance and the crypto world. If successful, it could open new opportunities and solidify Tron’s position in the DeFi market. TRX Technical Outlook TRX’s growth is supported by strong buying pressure, with data from the Bulls and Bears Indicator showing that bullish activity is dominating. The Money Flow Index (MFI) further confirms this trend, highlighting increased liquidity entering the market—an encouraging sign for TRX’s future prospects. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Avalanche (AVAX) Price To Hit New 52-week High Amid Breakout Rally? , Technical indicators over the past week suggest a positive outlook, though the token appears slightly “overbought.” If buying momentum continues, TRX could aim for $0.45 and even approach $1 in a highly optimistic scenario. However, if profit-taking occurs, a temporary pullback to around $0.33 is possible. RSI Levels Point to a Crucial Moment The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for TRX is at 87.08, reflecting intense buying activity. While this level typically hints at a potential pullback, historical patterns suggest another possibility. The last time TRX reached a similar RSI level, it climbed to its all-time high.

James Seyffart, who believes the spot Solana ETF will be approved under Trump's new SEC administration, said it's “just a matter of when, not if” for the SOL ETF to launch. Related News: BREAKING!

As the bullish trend gains momentum in the recovering market, will the TRX price reach the $0.50 psychological mark? Let’s find out.Tron Price AnalysisTron’s impressive parabolic rise is evident on the 4-hour chart, where it recently reached a new peak.

Over the past hour, a BitTorrent wallet deposited 7 million TRX tokens on Binance.Based on the current market price, these tokens are valued at approximately $2.72 million. Over the past 24 hours, the wallet has deposited 42 million TRX tokens worth around $11.5 million.As Tron’s supply on the Binance exchange grows, a minor pullback in TRX prices is expected. Despite the significant sale, BitTorrent still holds 56.23 million TRX tokens, valued at approximately $44 million.Tron Price Targets Following the massive surge in Tron’s market price, the MACD and signal lines have shown substantial bullish gaps, with skyrocketing positive histograms.Additionally, the simple moving average lines have seen a significant uptick with the engulfing candle. This marks the fourth consecutive bullish candle, reflecting a release of bullish momentum.The lower price rejection in the intraday candle from $0.366 shows strong support at the pivot point of $0.3685.

Hydra, which handled over $5 billion in cryptocurrency during its reign, was a hub for illicit activities, including drug sales, fake identities, and stolen financial data. The Moscow Regional Court also convicted 15 of Moiseev’s accomplices, issuing prison sentences ranging from 8 to 23 years. The group faced charges of criminal enterprise operation and illegal production and distribution of psychotropic substances. Moiseev was fined 4 million rubles ($38,100), while his associates were collectively ordered to pay 16 million rubles ($152,400). Additionally, properties and vehicles linked to the group were seized, and all sentences will be served under strict regimes in Russian correctional colonies, as reported by TASS. Hydra: A Darknet Giant Brought Down Launched in 2015, Hydra grew to become the world’s largest darknet marketplace, reportedly accounting for 80% of all darknet-related cryptocurrency transactions by 2021. The platform’s operations became increasingly sophisticated, with crypto transaction volumes surging by 624% between 2018 and 2020, according to a report by Flashpoint and TRM Labs. German authorities dismantled Hydra in April 2022, seizing its servers and Bitcoin holdings. At its peak, the platform boasted 17 million customers and 19,000 vendors. During the takedown, nearly a ton of narcotic substances was also confiscated. Despite Hydra’s closure, a Chainalysis report earlier this year revealed that darknet marketplaces collectively generated $1.7 billion in revenue in 2023—highlighting the resilience of illicit online trade. A Warning to Darknet Operators Hydra’s downfall marks a major victory for international law enforcement. Russia’s Ministry of Internal Affairs had been investigating the platform since 2016, and Moiseev’s conviction sends a strong message about the consequences of orchestrating such criminal networks. The sentences for Moiseev and his co-defendants are subject to appeals, but their convictions represent a broader effort to curb the use of cryptocurrencies in illegal activities. With Hydra’s demise and ongoing crackdowns, the darknet’s shadowy operations are being steadily exposed. As authorities strengthen their efforts, Hydra’s story serves as a cautionary tale for those exploiting cryptocurrency’s anonymity for illicit purposes .

Thanks to Cardano whales. Undoubtedly, the role whales have played in this surge is immense. Meanwhile, some recent reports indicate that Cardano no longer enjoys the favour of whales. What’s next? A fall? Cardano Whale Activity and Sell-Off Analysing the whales’ netflow metric is the best way to track the whale activity scenario. Reports say that the netflow index has sharply declined from 63.58 million ADA to 7.62 million ADA. The implication is crystal clear: at least 55.96 million ADA has been sold by the Cardano whale community. It sounds truly alarming, doesn’t it? There must be some strong justifications for this sudden shift in whale sentiment. December 6 ADA Token Unlock and Implications The most convincing justification that we can think of at this juncture is the December 6 ADA Token Unlock. Perhaps, the scheduled unlock event has encouraged the Cardano whale community to rebalance their portfolios. Certainly, an 18.53 million token unlock is going to contribute to high volatility in the market, at least for a few days. Market Indicators Highlight Volatility in Cardano Interestingly, prominent technical indicators also point to the possibility of volatility. In the scenario of volatility, the Bollinger Band indicator shows increasing bandwidth. It is exactly what we see now in the Cardano chart; a widening Bollinger band . Exactly the same is what the Relative Strength Index conveys. The RSI, which stands currently at 82.44, confirms that the market is currently in the overbought range. A market entering the overbought range naturally triggers the fear of price correction and volatility in traders. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ethereum Price Prediction (Dec 4th 2024) , Cardano Price Prediction and Scenarios Last month was an exceptional period for the Cardano market.

This month also, Cadano continues the legacy of November, though the only anomaly was the minor drop of 0.705% reported yesterday. Currently, the ADA price stands at $1.2344 . It does not mean that there is nothing to worry for Cardano. If the current whale trend continues, an upcoming drop is simply inevitable. Experts warn about the possibility of the price declining to as low as $0.92. You have heard it right. A 25.46% correction! Disappointing, isn’t it? We don’t have to lose hope. Experts also forecast that the exact opposite could be the case if the Cardano whale community resumes their accumulation. In a bullish scenario, the target could reach as high as $1.33, according to experts. Well. That looks interesting!

Lawmakers have access to potentially market-moving information before the general public does. To boot, committee assignments can give politicians an even greater informational edge. Unsurprisingly, this is often seen as a conflict between oaths of office and private interest. There have been some efforts to curtail the practice — but regulations aimed at doing so are disregarded regularly . You don’t have to look far or particularly hard to find suspicious trades made by politicians, no matter what Dan Crenshaw says . In addition, disclosure rules are set up in a way to obscure the exact amounts that public servants are investing in financial markets. Up to this point, U.S. politicians have generally invested in traditional assets — exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ), fixed-income assets like bonds, or most commonly, stocks . The trading of cryptocurrencies on Capitol Hill is still a nascent phenomenon — but one lawmaker is apparently ahead of the curve. A U.S. politician has made an unusual, suspicious trade — by investing in meme coins, as revealed by Finbold’s congressional trading radar.

Enable signal Mike Collins ushers in era of political meme coin trading Michael Collins, the representative for Georgia’s 10th congressional district, has been investing in crypto for some time. His first investments in digital assets — or at least the first ones he’s had to disclose, date back to October 2023. However, these were established cryptocurrencies — primarily Ethereum ( ETH ). On December 1 and December 2, the congressman made three transactions — two of which were Ski Mask Dog (SKI) purchases, as revealed in a period transaction report that was made public on December 2. Each of the SKI purchases was worth between $1,001 and $15,000 — in total, Collins invested between $2,002 and $30,000 in the meme coin. Period transaction report covering Collins’ purchase of SKI.

The filing also includes a $1,001 to $15,000 investment in Aerodrome Finance (AERO), another small-cap token — one that he had previously invested in. What’s most notable, however, is that Collins commented on the purchase — at least indirectly. On December 3, the representative posted an image of Pepe the Fog as a response to an X post made by unusual_whales documenting the trade . https://twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1863972451161620912 Is the public due for Congressional pump and dump schemes?

There is an exciting update for all Ethereum enthusiasts. The market is about to witness a fabulous golden cross. Has the Altcoin Season Begun ? Or is it too early to shoot such a question? Anyway, there is no shortage of excitement in the Altcoin community. Let’s join this happiness, and see what’s exactly happening. Ethereum Golden Cross: What You Should Know Last week, many experts predicted the possibility of a golden cross in Ethereum. Since then, the entire Ethereum community has been impatiently waiting for that moment. And the moment has finally arrived today. The 50-day SMA of Ethereum has just touched its 200-day SMA. What makes a golden cross noteworthy is that it paves the way for explosive growth. Ethereum definitely looks very bullish right now . In the last 24 hours alone, it has seen a growth of 3.0%. Interesting to note is the fact that in the previous golden cross, the ETH market experienced a 2x gain. Alt Season and Ethereum: An Simple Overview There is a high chance for an Ethereum golden cross to trigger an Alt Season. Ethereum, with a market cap of $447,966,072,120, is the top altcoin by market cap. There is no wonder why Alt Season has all of a sudden returned to the discussion tables of the crypto community. In fact, at least two prerequisites for the start of an Alt Season have already happened: Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin, and Bitcoin’s dominance falling .

37207809,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51325,1733311009,What Is the Last Casino Craze Sweeping the Nation?,"Isn’t casino gambling regulated at a state-by-state level? You might be surprised to hear that there is a casino craze sweeping the nation when gambling legality in the USA is determined at state and not the federal level. However, this new craze, which is most certainly casino activity, is not governed by gambling laws. You might be wondering how that is possible. The answer is that while gambling at casinos for real money is strictly regulated, playing casino games just for fun and for virtual wins is altogether different while being remarkably the same. Welcome to the world of sweeps and social gambling. A brief history of gambling in the US Ok, we know that sounds like something of a paradox, but bear with us, and we will explain. The United States has some quite contradictory attitudes towards gambling. On the one hand, the country might never have become what it is without gambling – as many of the original settlements were founded using monies raised through lotteries so as ‘not to overburden’ the British Crown. On the other hand, for decades in the 20 th Century, casino gambling was forbidden just about everywhere other than Las Vegas and, latterly, Atlantic City. The irony of being home to the ‘capital of gambling’ and having some of the world’s most restrictive gambling laws was not lost on people who enjoyed a flutter. Changes Two significant changes have come about in fairly recent years, which changed the face of real money gambling. The internet played a large part in these changes, as it has in many other areas of our lives. Firstly, a small number of states pushed for changes to legislation to enable them to offer residents legal access to iGaming platforms in their states. They could do this as, in 2011, the Department of Justice issued a legal opinion that changed how the federal government interpreted the 1961 Wire Act, meaning that it only applied to sports betting and no other forms of online gambling. New Jersey, Nevada, and Delaware legalized online casino games first, then Pennsylvania came on board, followed by West Virginia and Michigan While all of this was in train, the Supreme Court struck down PASPA’s countrywide ban on sports betting, having deemed it unconstitutional. This led to many states opening up physical and online sports betting markets, and gambling for real money in some form or another is now legal in thirty-eight states, plus in DC. All bets are on This opening up means that attitudes towards gambling have changed – it has come out of the shadows and into the light. The rise of smartphones and improved mobile connectivity has also fuelled growth and as cryptocurrencies move into the mainstream many platforms are integrating them into their payments systems. The role of social media Social media and gaming have also popularised casino games that are played just for the fun of it. In some games, playing at a virtual casino can be a way to earn points to move up to the next level or unlock online rewards. In other circumstances, the games are there just for the sheer thrill and fun of playing. Anyone who has spent time at the penny arcades knows that monetary rewards are not what makes gambling so entertaining. So much has to do with the feeling of anticipation as the reels tumble or the coins fall and the subsequent win or lose. Sometimes, a simple ‘win’ can be enough to bring a dopamine rush. The rise of the latest craze It is for the thrill of playing that the latest casino craze has taken off. Sweeps casinos are available to play almost everywhere in the US because the player uses virtual Gold or Sweeps coins rather than real money. They are not paying to bet on the direct outcome of the game and cannot pay to win. However, the same top games can be played, and it is even possible to exchange virtual prizes for real ones. This means that most Americans can play casino-style games for free with Sweepstakes casinos, and it is all entirely legal. Sweepstakes casinos offer all the fun and the same high-quality games as their real-money counterparts but with much less risk. In addition, they are open to everyone and not just to those who live in the handful of real-money casino gambling states. The other great thing about sweepstakes casinos is the bonuses. They offer seemingly crazy bonuses to get people to sign up, return, and keep playing on their sites. Over forty-five social casinos are operating in the US – they really are sweeping the nation and gaining in popularity, with eleven new ones launching this year. Some of the best have truly impressive game lobbies with thousands of games on offer. In addition to all the free coins on offer, you can also purchase more sweeps coins for as little as $0.49! How are they legal? Sweepstakes casinos are legal because they adhere to specific rules, which means that all prizes are identifiable before entry, the competitions have a clear end date, and making a purchase with real money does not enhance your chances of winning. Currently, sweeps casinos are not permitted in Washington, Michigan, Idaho, or Nevada, but social casinos are allowed everywhere other than Washington. What are the differences between sweeps, social, and real money casinos? Sweepstake casinos let you play online casino games and win virtual currency prizes, which can be redeemed for real money prizes. You can do all of this without spending a dollar. You can also buy extra goes, but this does not enhance your chance of winning. Sweeps casino games are powered by Gold Coins and Sweeps Coins. They are legal in over forty-five states. Social casinos also allow you to play great online casino games and many of your favorite slots, but you will never be able to redeem virtual winnings for cash prizes. Social casinos are for the pure fun of it and maybe seeing your name at the top of a leaderboard. Real money online casinos allow you to stake real money for prizes, just as you would in a land-based casino; however, you can only access these legally if you reside in certain places. You don’t have to be a permanent resident, but you do need to be located in the state when you are playing. Finally To make a general ‘sweeping’ statement, gambling in all its forms is becoming increasingly mainstream in the US, and the trends for participation and profitability are upwards.

Liquidations near $600M, and bulls take a rest","Over the last 24 hours, crypto market liquidations have reportedly surpassed $590 million, coupled with an increased number of crypto market positions. The surge in liquidations follows South Korea’s President’s decision to enact martial law in the country, which caused heightened activity in crypto exchanges. MN Consultancy founder and crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe has cautioned crypto investors of a pending market flash crash after weeks of bull run that saw digital currencies surge in prices. In an X post , van de Poppe stated that market corrections might happen and that they would lead to a brief market crash. He urged crypto enthusiasts not to “panic” and called the scenario a “blessing.” Crypto market is due for a flash crash. Source: X (@cryptomichNL) Crypto flash crashes are significant declines in crypto prices that usually take place within a short period. These drops cause mass liquidations that often wipe out billions in market value, leading to widespread panic selling and emotionally driven trading. The crash historically precedes a gradual recovery as the market corrects itself while seeking a new equilibrium price. BTC, XRP lead market liquidation volumes The crypto market has experienced a downturn in the past 24 hours, with approximately $590.6 million in liquidations following South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol’s now-reversed declaration of martial law. According to a CoinGlass report , $87 million in Bitcoin (BTC) and $75.90 million in Ripple (XRP) positions were liquidated during this period. On-chain data shows that in the past 24 hours, 207,871 traders were liquidated. The largest single liquidation order happened on OKX – BTC-USDT-SWAP value of $15.09M Bitcoin, Ether, and XRP all saw significant price drops following Tuesday’s political unrest in South Korea. This trend is not new. In 2022, the market bled following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin had rebounded by 2.4%, Ether gained 3.3%, and XRP recovered 9.2% by the end of the day. Graphic for crypto liquidations in the last 24 hours. Source: Coinglass XRP’s remarkable rally , which had seen the crypto rise by over 400% month-to-date, was temporarily halted following the crisis in South Korea. The price of XRP dropped by 8% on December 3 following President Yoon’s unprecedented martial law announcement. The volatility was particularly evident on South Korean exchanges, with XRP’s price on Upbit, the country’s largest exchange by trading volume, plummeting more than 50% to $1.30. This sharp decline was exacerbated by the high concentration of XRP holders in South Korea. Notably, XRP investors have been realizing profits at a staggering rate, with over $4 billion in profits taken over the past three days alone, as revealed by Santiment . The figure represents the highest profit-taking activity since April 2021. CryptoQuant also shared data revealing a significant rise in the number of XRP tokens being moved into exchanges, from 46 million to 654 million in just seven days, signaling a wave of selling as traders mull thoughts of cashing out. While the market saw an uptick in profit-taking, the overbought conditions in XRP, with its Relative Strength Index (RSI) reaching 74 and 84 on short—and long-term charts, suggest that buyer exhaustion may be at play. Analysts predict a potential support level at $2.50, a possible entry point for those who missed out on XRP’s recent surge. Bitcoin whales take up holding positions Bitcoin whales are supposedly waiting for the coin’s price trend before making the decision to sell, according to CryptoQuant contributor Onat Tütüncüler. The market analyst observed a notable increase in Bitcoin inflows to crypto exchanges since Donald Trump’s election victory on November 5, which he revealed have largely not been sold. In normal market standards, such large transfers signal potential sell-offs. However, according to Tütüncüler, the Adjusted SOPR metric hasn’t shown significant profit-taking, creating the indication that the BTC inflow in exchanges could be for reasons beyond short-term selling pressures. Bitcoin almost reached the $100,000 mark after weeks of successive all-time highs, falling short by a mere $440 before dropping to $93,250, per Coingecko data .

Fox Business Reports suggest Donald Trump’s team is considering some big names for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chair—and they’re crypto-friendly! As of now, there are some grey areas in the US administration in terms of crypto, and to make it crypto-friendly we need a good contender in both the CFTC and SEC. While Trump is yet to take charge, the team behind him has started the homework of assigning key offices to their elected picks. However, there is already a controversy happening in the crypto world with the change of the SEC’s litigation officer, who is anti-crypto; it will be interesting to see who takes this big role, as there is a lot at stake. Here are the key contenders for the role! Who’s in the Running? First up, Perianne Boring, CEO of the Digital Chamber of Commerce. In 2021, Perianne Boring urged President Biden to adopt a national blockchain strategy with clearer token regulations, fairer crypto tax policies , and blockchain-based solutions for money laundering. She’s also been a vocal critic of the SEC’s aggressive stance on crypto, arguing in 2023 that treating secondary market transactions as securities overreaches regulatory boundaries, as highlighted in a Coinbase insider trading case. Then there’s Caroline Pham, a current CFTC commissioner. She’s already shown support for innovation, proposing pilot programs to regulate digital assets and calling for global regulatory cooperation. Her approach focuses on balancing innovation with risk management, making her a solid pick for the role. Apart from them, Summer Mersinger, another CFTC commissioner, is also being considered for the top spot. While details about her stance on crypto are less clear, her inclusion shows the competition is heating up. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Australia’s Tough New Crypto Rules Spark Debate: Will Startups Leave? , What This Means for Crypto in the U.S. If Boring or Pham lands the role, it could signal a more balanced, innovation-friendly approach to crypto regulation.

Trump’s team seeks to reverse Biden’s regulatory crackdown on crypto, aligning with industry calls for a more supportive framework.

On Sunday evening, the company reserved 200 million XRP from this month’s 1 billion unlock, ready to offload. As Finbold reported, Ripple unlocked December’s tokens in three escrows from two known XRP accounts under the company’s control. Ripple (24) unlocked 200 million and 300 million XRP, sending the lower amount to Ripple (1) , the company’s treasury account. Then, Ripple (24) sent the 300 million tokens to Ripple (12) , locking it in another escrow with finality for 2028. Meanwhile, Ripple (25) unlocked 500 million XRP in a single escrow and similarly relocked it all with Ripple (13) . Ripple (24) and Ripple (25) XRP transactions in December after unlocks. Source: XRP Scan / Finbold How much of XRP will Ripple sell in December 2024? So far, Ripple has signaled an intention to sell the 200 million XRP reserved at Ripple (1), worth $528 million. While this month’s reserve is not the highest in XRP tokens count, it will be Ripple’s largest sell in USD value – even larger than November’s 470 million XRP dump , which started at an average of $0.55 per token, totaling $258 million. In total, Ripple has already offloaded over 3 billion XRP year-to-date and is about to close 2024 with massive profits. Interestingly, only four out of eleven months had a 200 million XRP sale. The company added more tokens from its controlled accounts in all other months, which could happen again in December. XRP/USD price chart and Ripple’s dumps, daily chart. Source: TradingView / Finbold / @vinibarbosabr While the company did not disclose each sale separately, Ripple has already disclosed its selling model on many occasions. According to sources , its XRP sales go through an On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) model, selling at market price to willing customers. Nevertheless, even this model requires an upcoming demand and dilutes exchanges’ order books by absorbing most of this XRP buying pressure. XRP investors can monitor Ripple’s accounts to be aware of potential sales and unlocks that can dilute their holdings. Every time the company unlocks tokens from escrows, it inflates XRP’s circulating supply, requiring a proportional demand increase. Featured image from Shutterstock.

Analysts Explain: ""It's Not South Korea Alone This Time!""","There have been incredible increases in altcoins in recent days. At this point, while well-established altcoins such as XRP and Tron (TRX) attract attention, the reasons for the increases are also wondered. At this point, while South Korea comes to mind first for the sudden price increases in old altcoins like XRP, analysts state that there are other reasons behind the increases. Analysts said that investors from the United States as well as South Korea contributed to XRP’s impressive rally. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju stated that whales were active on Coinbase and that US investors also contributed to the rise. According to Coindesk, FRNT analysts also said that the increasing activity on US stock exchanges was also behind the XRP rise. “WSJ describes Trump's second term as 'a new era for crypto — fewer government obstacles.' According to XRP supporters, under the Trump administration, XRP will become more accessible to large financial institutions. Trump’s affinity for crypto supports his thesis that payments-focused XRP will “become widespread as a bridge currency for foreign exchange transactions in international capital flows.” Although Coinbase whales also contributed to the XRP rally, XRP trading volume on Korean exchanges remains much larger. XRP, which has gained 3.2% in the last 24 hours, continues to be traded at $2.64 at the time of writing. *Not investment advice. Continue Reading: What's the Real Reason Behind the XRP Rise?

The readings provide insight into three specific areas: risk, credit and leverage. For the week ended Nov. 22, the index dropped to -0.64, a level not seen since August 2021 in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.  A negative reading suggests financial conditions are looser than average indicating that liquidity is readily available. A positive reading, in contrast, means tighter-than-average conditions with capital hard to come by, as during the 2008 global financial crisis.  Zooming out, we're in one of the most financially loose periods since data started being collected in 1971. With U.S. headline inflation at an annual 2.6%, well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target since February 2021, it's possible 75 basis points of interest-rate cuts since September and a 4.75% rate now have done little to rein in investors' appetite for risk.  The S&P 500, for example, has ratcheted up its 55th all-time high this year, adding 28% since the start of January, according to Zerohedge. Bitcoin (BTC) has surged 118% and the total crypto market cap has more than doubled to approach $3.5 trillion, according to the TOTAL metric on TradingView.  Bitcoin and DXY rise together    Risk assets tend to have an inverse correlation with the DXY index, a measure of the U.S. dollar against a number of other major currencies. Typically, the index is considered strong when it's over 100. It's held over 106 since Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election.   That makes bitcoin's rally particularly interesting, because it breaks the inverse behavior. The 30-day correlation between bitcoin and the DXY index is at 0.66 over the past seven years, one of the strongest levels for that period.  As financial conditions loosen and total U.S. debt hits a record $36.17 trillion, the largest cryptocurrency seems to be thriving with its ability to soak up liquidity overriding the strong dollar.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/04/with-u-s-financial-conditions-the-loosest-in-years-bitcoin-can-continue-to-thrive-van-straten,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/89c9bb0f4cfc978fc379627b4d2b396e4edabf0e-1110x400.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The digital asset has experienced a remarkable 40% increase in just one week. Related Reading: Cardano Rally Heats Up: Experts See 750% Jump Ahead Demand for LINK significantly increased from $16.54 on November 26 to $25.73 by December 3. As the largest price increase since January 2022, this spike indicates a new wave of investor enthusiasm and momentum. Surge Fueled By Whale Activity Whale activity is one of the main drivers for this rally. LookonChain reported on December 3 that a whale address scooped up 269,861 LINK tokens, valued at $6.68 million. The acquisition of 107,838 tokens on a decentralized exchange by the whale, costing $2.6 million, shows that confidence in LINK continues to grow. Furthermore, 162,024 LINK tokens, which were valued at $4.08 million, were withdrawn from Binance, underscoring the increased interest of institutional investors. The price of $LINK has surged 36% today! A whale bought 269,861 $LINK($6.68M) in the past 12 hours. The whale spent $2.6M to buy 107,838 $LINK at $24.1 on DEX and withdrew 162,024 $LINK($4.08M) from #Binance.https://t.co/Zuxgpk23Sm pic.twitter.com/hNQ65oZkfi — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 3, 2024 This isn’t just something whales do. Other large holders also play a crucial part. As small and medium-sized investors increase their shares, new investors are now jumping on the Chainlink bandwagon. IntoTheBlock data shows that over the last 30 days, the number of LINK tokens owned by small buyers (1,000 to 10,000) has grown by 35%. In the same vein, mid-tier investors, who held 10,000 to 100,000 LINK, experienced a significant 86.79% increase in accumulation. Bullish Forecasts & Strong Market Performance Chainlink’s market capitalization has now exceeded $15 billion, following a 25% increase in the past 24 hours. The asset’s remarkable performance is also contributing to the current optimism in the DeFi sector, which is on the brink of a $150 billion market capitalization. $LINK/usdt DAILY It’s $LINK SEASON, now we do $22 –> $52 🚀🚀 https://t.co/kJOaCpeyML pic.twitter.com/dg3H5au2fU — Satoshi Flipper (@SatoshiFlipper) December 3, 2024 Well-known figures such as Satoshi Flipper have predicted a target price of $52 for LINK, which is a particularly bullish outlook among analysts. A breakout rally has gained more steam, emulating the 2022-2023 trendline breakout, which signaled a substantial rebound in the broader market. Coinglass indicators show a 57% growth in futures open interest to $708 million and rising investor interest. Trading volume in derivatives rose 450% to $5 billion. This shows a surge in speculative activity, which bodes well for LINK’s growth. Related Reading: Cardano To Hit $10?

However, the bulls stepped in and have buoyed the price back up to $96,700. Can this upside movement continue? Breakout, or yet another rejection to come? After dropping to the bottom trendline of the short-term triangle it is within, the $BTC price was bought up quickly by the bulls. The price is once again heading to the top of the triangle where a breakout could take place. Martial law overturned in South Korea Many factors could have contributed to the rapid fall in price for $BTC - not least, the sudden declaration of martial law in South Korea by its president Yoon Suk-yeol - a move which was swiftly overturned by the nation’s parliament. Blackrock IBIT ETF now holds half a million BTC In the US, the Blackrock IBIT Spot Bitcoin ETF bought another 7.23K BTC on Tuesday, bringing its overall holdings to 500.38K BTC. Half a million Bitcoin purchased in less than a year by just one entity says volumes for where the $BTC price might potentially go over the rest of this bull market. Crypto-friendly regulators on the way in? On the regulatory front, Paul Atkins is still the Trump pick to assume the mantle of SEC Chairman. This is despite rumours that Atkins is reluctant to take the job. For the role of overall “Crypto Czar”, former CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo is the president’s preferred pick. If both men are confirmed in these positions, with both very open and favourable to crypto, this could undoubtedly provide a huge boost to Bitcoin going into the end of this year. $BTC revisits bottom of triangle Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for Bitcoin shows that the price did spike down to the bottom of the flag, which also coincided with the 0.618 Fibonacci for this last downward move. This was a good place for a bounce, and $BTC did just that. Now that the price has had a decent rise, it has come up exactly against the 0.618 Fibonacci to the upside. If it can battle through this level, the 0.786 Fibonacci is just ahead, together with the top of the triangle. Both of these are likely to provide strong resistance. Bollinger Band jaws wide open on 2-week chart Source: TradingView The Bollinger Bands on the two-week chart tell a story. It can be seen how the jaws of the bands opened wide as the bull market developed through 2020/2021, and how the price generally kept outside of the upper band, until entering back inside at the first of the double tops. After squeezing together in early 2023, and then again later in that year, the price then kept to the upper band until coming back inside at the $69,000 top. Now the price is on the way up again, the jaws have opened really wide, and it now remains to be seen if the price can stay at the edge of the upper band. Once it definitively comes inside, could this be the end of the bull market? Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Account activation on the XRP Ledger refers to the process by which an account becomes operational or usable on the network. A reserve is the minimum amount to be held in any XRP address for it to send funds.  Every XRP address starts as non-activated, meaning it can't send or receive funds until activated. It is locked to prevent spam accounts by making it costly to create multiple accounts.  On the other hand, the base reserve requirement is the fee associated with owning an object on the ledger. An object refers to any data element that the ledger stores, including payment channels, escrows, offers, or transactional information.  A drop in fees comes as account creation activity spiked on XRPL in the past days, with over 30,000 accounts created earlier on Monday (compared to usually under 2,000 in the previous weeks), network data show.

As the altcoin season intensifies, SOL may become key to additional growth. On-chain data shows whales are back to accumulating Solana (SOL) in self-custodial wallets. SOL has stabilized around $236.39, with no signs of immediately chasing a new all-time high. Demand for SOL is coming from the decentralized ecosystem, liquid staking projects, and from the potential to adopt SOL after Grayscale filed to transform its Solana investment product into an ETF. SOL remains one of the key blue chip tokens, a potential entry into multiple trades. Meme tokens are still going strong on Solana, with both Pump.fun activity and secondary trading still attracting liquidity. Solana ecosystem activity has also achieved more reliable transactions, with up to 63% of all transfers passing, and a failure rate of only 36%. Failed transactions have reached close to 70% in the past, limiting the potential for DeFi usage. The Solana ecosystem gained attention once again after the listing of Moodeng (MOODENG), the first Pump.fun token to enter Coinbase. Solana’s activity may extend the meme token market. SOL is yet undecided on its narrative, whether it would perform along with the meme space, or follow the lead of ‘dinosaur altcoins’ recently breaking to new record prices. Four whales withdrew SOL from Binance A total of four whale transactions were noticed in the past 24 hours, withdrawing 185,510 SOL from Binance. The funds, valued at $42.46M, were sent to four large-scale whale wallets. Some of the whale activity on Solana is considered a sign of smart money moving in, buying the dip and riding the recent trends. Two of the addresses were simple holders of SOL. The first wallet was a frequent trader, moving coins to the centralized exchange in the past for realizing profits. The second wallet held a larger reserve of 31,333 SOL and serving as an intermediary for outflows. That wallet sent out 6,249 SOL to another intermediary address. SOL may be used for both simple and liquid staking, as well as lending and DEX liquidity. Solana drew in $9.2B in value after the 2024 market recovery. Holding SOL in a self-custody wallet gives more flexibility for traders. Binance also offers its own BNSOL liquid staking token, but these particular whales wanted full control of their coins. The next whale wallet belongs to active meme token traders with extensive portfolios. The largest wallet held 46,103.18 SOL and a total of 119 meme tokens.

The top 100 rich list includes a burn address, and carries around 40% of all coins and tokens. Out of more than 536M SOL, 1.26M is held as wrapped SOL (WSOL) on the Ethereum ecosystem for trading, DeFi and other tasks. Whales are actually a rarity on the Solana ecosystem, where the bulk of wallets hold less than 0.01 SOL . Whales also accumulate Pepe (PEPE) Whale transactions were also registered for Pepe (PEPE), a relatively older meme coin. After the listing on Coinbase, PEPE held relatively stable near the peak of its range at $0.000020. The meme token has spent a few weeks at that level, suggesting it may be ready for a breakout. Even with centralized listings, on-chain activity also reflects sentiment for tokens. One recent holder build up a PEPE stash to qualify for the top 150 of addresses, for now leaving the tokens dormant. Additionally, the Bybit cold wallet , the third-largest holder of PEPE, has become active, sending and receiving coins from the exchange. PEPE is considered one of the prime candidates to extend the meme super cycle. Meme tokens also boost demand for ETH and SOL as utility tokens and as components of trading pairs. A breakout of PEPE may affect the entire meme ecosystem and continue the rollover of liquidity.

No coding skills? No problem! This no-code tool is designed to simplify the process, potentially revolutionizing how tokens are launched on the BNB Chain . But is it really as groundbreaking as it sounds? Let’s explore what SpringBoard has to offer and whether it lives up to the hype. Simple Token Creation for All SpringBoard allows anyone to create a crypto token without needing to understand coding or programming. Plus, there are no platform fees, which is a huge benefit for people who want to launch their own tokens but don’t have technical skills. 1/5 Introducing PancakeSwap SpringBoard: The all-in-one platform to create and launch your project’s token on @bnbchain PancakeSwap No Coding Zero Launch Fee Multi-Token Pairings Boost Liquidity with CAKE Create now https://t.co/GTZ2heWbzy More… pic.twitter.com/pmuBcO3xde — PancakeSwap (@PancakeSwap) December 4, 2024 With SpringBoard, all aspects of token creation are handled in one place. From setting up liquidity to trading, it’s all integrated. Once your token hits the bonding curve target of 24 BNB, it is automatically paired with PancakeSwap’s decentralized exchange (DEX). This saves time and removes the need for external tools. Developers also have flexibility with token pair options such as BNB, USDT, or CAKE. The requirements are simple: at least one million tokens in supply and a minimum raised amount of $2,000. The platform is designed to be accessible and straightforward for all users. Fair, Secure, and Transparent SpringBoard’s fair launch mechanism ensures everyone gets a fair chance to participate. There is no ICO or presales. The token price is determined dynamically using a bonding curve. This is adjusted based on supply and demand. Security is a key feature of SpringBoard. Anti-sniping measures protect token launches from bots that could manipulate prices. This adds trust for both creators and investors, ensuring a fair launch process. Compared to platforms like Pump.fun, which saw a 207% revenue increase in November, SpringBoard goes further by combining token creation, liquidity, and trading in one platform. This makes it a more complete solution for launching a token. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Australia’s Tough New Crypto Rules Spark Debate: Will Startups Leave? , Is SpringBoard Right for You?

Amid growing bullish sentiment in the crypto market, Binance Coin has reached a new all-time high. Surpassing the $750 mark, BNB now boasts a market cap of $109 billion.With a 24-hour trading volume of $5.5 billion, the altcoin has surged by 16.65% over the past 24 hours. This drives the 30-day returns to 35.33%, increasing the likelihood of a continued bullish trend. Will this recovery rally push the price past the $800 barrier? Let’s find out.Binance Coin BNB Price AnalysisIn the daily chart, the BNB price action showcases a massive bullish engulfing candle formed last night. This accounts for a 13.50% surge from the opening price of $648 to the closing at $735.50.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has announced a policy to avoid law firms hiring individuals he claims worked against the crypto industry during their time in government, signaling a pushback against perceived regulatory overreach. Meanwhile, Bitget has expanded its presence in Southeast Asia with the launch of BitEXC in Vietnam, aiming to cater to one of the world’s largest crypto-owning populations through tailored services and local partnerships. Bitget Launches BitEXC in Vietnam: A New Era of Cryptocurrency Trading in Southeast Asia Cryptocurrency exchange Bitget has launched BitEXC, a new trading platform specifically designed for the Vietnamese market. The platform promises to cater to the unique preferences of Vietnamese users through tailored services, localized customer support, and educational outreach, marking a pivotal step in Bitget’s expansion plans. Vietnam has emerged as a global hotspot for cryptocurrency adoption, ranking second worldwide in cryptocurrency ownership, with approximately 21.2% of the population holding digital assets. Recognizing this significant potential, Bitget and BitEXC CEO Gracy Chen expressed the platform's mission to bridge existing gaps in the market: ”Vietnam has shown tremendous potential in crypto, but yet the market still needs platforms that truly understand and cater to its unique audience. BitEXC was created to bridge this gap by providing local support and products customized to fill the needs of its crypto users,” Chen said. BitEXC is designed to resonate with Vietnamese crypto enthusiasts by offering a comprehensive suite of trading options, including peer-to-peer ( P2P ) trading, spot trading, and futures trading. Initially, only P2P trading was operational at launch, with spot and futures trading to follow shortly. To enhance convenience for local users, BitEXC integrates popular Vietnamese payment methods such as ViettelPay, Momo (a subsidiary of Canadian fintech Nuvei), and ZaloPay, which is tied to the country’s leading messaging platform, Zalo. BitEXC is not just another trading platform; it comes with a clear roadmap aimed at fostering user engagement and financial growth. Key features expected to roll out within the next three months include an ”Earn” program and copy trading, enabling users to diversify their income streams and follow successful traders’ strategies. The platform leverages Bitget’s robust infrastructure and security protocols, extending the benefits of the $300 million Bitget Protection Fund to BitEXC users. The fund, held in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), is designed to protect users against market volatility and unforeseen risks. Vietnam’s Crypto Landscape: A Market Poised for Growth Vietnam’s burgeoning interest in cryptocurrency aligns with its government’s proactive stance on blockchain technology. The Ministry of Information and Communications recently unveiled a National Blockchain Strategy, which aims to integrate blockchain into various industries and provide legal recognition for digital assets. This progressive regulatory framework sets the stage for platforms like BitEXC to thrive. However, BitEXC faces competition in a market where decentralized exchanges (DEXs) dominate user preferences. A 2023 survey revealed that 90% of Vietnamese crypto users favor DEXs over centralized platforms. To capture market share, BitEXC must deliver on its promise of localized services and user-centric innovations. BitEXC’s launch coincides with a period of significant growth for Bitget. The exchange reported $700 million in capital inflows in Q2 2024, along with a 50% quarter-on-quarter increase in traffic. Boasting over 45 million users globally, Bitget continues to expand its offerings, recently listing Hedera (HBAR) on Dec. 3—the same day BitEXC debuted. In this surging marketplace, BitEXC has the potential to become a major player, provided it delivers on its promises of localized support and innovative trading solutions. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong Takes a Stand Against Anti-Crypto Officials in Law Firms In other crypto exchange news, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced that the exchange will no longer work with law firms that hire individuals involved in what he called ”anti-crypto actions” during their government tenure. This declaration, made via an X post on Dec. 3, has sparked widespread debate within the legal and crypto communities. Armstrong accused some former government officials of attempting to ”unlawfully kill” the cryptocurrency industry by failing to clarify regulatory frameworks. Without naming specific individuals, he urged the broader crypto community to take a stand, stating: Armstrong’s comments come amid a growing sentiment within the crypto sector that regulatory ambiguity and enforcement-heavy tactics have stifled innovation. He claimed that senior partners at many law firms remain unaware of the crypto industry's stance on this issue and called on crypto advocates to communicate the potential consequences of hiring anti-crypto officials. Armstrong’s post specifically highlighted Coinbase’s decision to sever ties with Milbank, a prominent law firm, after it hired Gurbir Grewal, the former enforcement director of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Grewal, who left the SEC in October 2024, had played a pivotal role in over 100 enforcement actions targeting the digital asset industry. Milbank announced Grewal’s appointment to its litigation and arbitration group on Oct. 15, with Chairman Scott Edelman lauding Grewal’s “record of success” as a federal prosecutor and enforcement official. However, Armstrong criticized Grewal’s tenure at the SEC, stating: ”If you were senior there, you cannot say you were just following orders. They had the option to leave the SEC, and many good people did. It was not a normal SEC tenure.” This move marks one of the first high-profile instances of a crypto company taking direct action against a law firm based on its hiring decisions. A Tense Regulatory Backdrop Grewal’s tenure at the SEC coincided with heightened regulatory scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry. Under his leadership, the SEC pursued numerous enforcement actions against crypto firms, often citing noncompliance with securities laws. Critics within the industry have argued that the SEC’s approach has been overly punitive, targeting businesses without providing clear guidelines for compliance. The SEC's stance has long been a contentious issue for the crypto industry, which has repeatedly called for clear regulatory frameworks. Armstrong’s decision to cut ties with Milbank signals a shift toward a more confrontational approach, where the industry actively challenges those perceived as adversaries. Armstrong’s statements have elicited mixed reactions. Supporters in the crypto community have praised his stance as a necessary step to defend the industry against overreach. Others, however, have raised concerns about the potential implications for the legal profession and the crypto sector’s relationship with regulatory bodies. Legal experts suggest that Armstrong's move could prompt law firms to reassess their hiring practices, particularly as the crypto industry becomes an increasingly significant client base. However, it also raises ethical questions about whether firms should be penalized for hiring individuals with regulatory experience, even if their actions in government were controversial. Armstrong’s comments come at a time of renewed optimism within the crypto community following Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 US presidential election. Many believe the new administration will adopt a more favorable regulatory stance toward digital assets. This optimism has fueled bullish momentum in the market, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $99,645 on Nov. 22. The changing political climate may provide an opportunity for the crypto industry to push for clearer regulations and repair strained relationships with regulatory agencies. However, Armstrong’s hardline stance suggests that tensions between the industry and certain officials remain unresolved. Brian Armstrong’s decision to cut ties with Milbank over its hiring of Gurbir Grewal represents a significant moment in the relationship between the crypto industry and regulatory authorities. By refusing to work with law firms that hire individuals perceived as adversaries of the industry, Coinbase is sending a clear message: the crypto sector will no longer passively accept regulatory actions that it views as harmful or unjust. As the industry navigates a rapidly changing regulatory landscape, Armstrong’s bold stance may inspire other crypto companies to take similar actions, potentially reshaping the dynamics between the sector and its legal and regulatory counterparts.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6374/bitget-strengthens-southeast-asia-presence-with-vietnam-launch,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

37205378,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622386,1733307883,"South Korean Won strengthens, while XRP, BTC, and equities tank amid calls for the president to step down","South Korea’s political landscape took an unprecedented turn on Tuesday as President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law. The South Korean Won (KRW) briefly weakened against the dollar, while Bitcoin (BTC) and Ripple (XRP) values plummeted on Upbit. Hours after Yoon’s unexpected decision, which saw public protests and army involvement, his cabinet reversed the order to impose martial law on the country. According to CNN, the public and policymakers are now collectively calling for President Yoon Suk Yeol’s resignation. XRP and BTC prices drop in South Korea Prior to President Yoon’s declaration of martial law, Ripple’s XRP saw heightened trading activity on South Korean crypto exchanges like Upbit and Bithumb. South Korea’s retail crypto market recorded a surge that saw trading volumes reach $18 billion on December 2, the second-highest level in 2024, according to a 10x Research report . On Upbit, South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, XRP trading against the Korean Won (KRW) reached $3.8 billion, a volume 11 times higher than Bitcoin’s on the platform, as revealed by blockchain analytics firm Scopescan. Historically, XRP enthusiasts have pushed the coin to heightened trading values – values other crypto exchanges couldn’t match. Crypto markets in South Korea witnessed dramatic volatility on Tuesday following President Yoon Suk Yeol’s martial law announcement. Bitcoin (BTC) plummeted 33% on the Upbit exchange, briefly trading below $80,000, significantly lower than its global average of $95,000 on exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. Source: X XRP mirrored this downward trend, plummeting by more than 50% to a low of $1.13 on Upbit. CoinGecko reported XRP trading at $2.52 globally on the same day, highlighting a 6.3% discount on Upbit, a notable divergence for one of the market’s top-performing cryptocurrencies in recent weeks. According to CoinGecko data, XRP is trading at $2.56 on global exchanges at the time of writing, while BTC is changing hands at $95,509. However, these values in Upbit are 12% to 15% down. South Korean Won stabilizes after political turmoil scare The South Korean Won faced sharp declines, hitting a two-year low of 1,443.40 won per U.S. dollar following President Yoon Suk Yeol’s abrupt martial law declaration in a late-night televised address. Markets showed initial panic, with the currency losing significant ground amid political uncertainty. However, after parliament unanimously overturned the martial law decree with a 190-vote consensus and Yoon subsequently lifted the order, the Won recouped some losses. By the end of Tuesday, it had recovered to 1,418.35 per dollar, still down 1% for the day. Yoon defended his actions as a necessary measure to protect liberal democracy, citing opposition parties’ alleged attempts to destabilize the country. “I declare martial law to protect the free Republic of Korea from the threat of North Korean communist forces, to eradicate the despicable pro-North Korean anti-state forces that are plundering the freedom and happiness of our people, and to protect the free constitutional order,” Yoon said. Crypto outpaces stock trades in South Korea In the wake of Donald Trump’s election victory, South Korea’s crypto market has outshined its traditional equities counterpart. Between November 5 and November 28, daily trading volumes on local crypto exchanges such as Upbit , Bithumb, and Korbit averaged $9.4 billion, significantly surpassing the $7 billion average of the Kospi equity index. During this period, the Kospi dropped by 3.4%, while an index tracking the top 100 cryptocurrencies surged by 53%. The enthusiasm for digital assets among South Koreans is not new. Over 7 million people, nearly 15% of the population, are registered with crypto exchanges. Bitcoin’s meteoric rise of over 1,200% in the past five years has been a key motivator, dwarfing Kospi’s 20% return in the same timeframe. According to a recent Bloomberg report, many South Korean investors now pivot to altcoins, which constitute over 80% of the trading volume on local platforms. Promotions like fee waivers by exchanges, including Bithumb, which recently claimed over 30% market share, further bolster investors’ participation. President-elect Trump , who promised to impose additional tariffs on Chinese imports during his rallies, described South Korea as a “money machine,” insinuating the country should bear the costs of hosting American troops.

The lawsuit alleges that the company misled investors about its acquisition of US Bitcoin Corp. (USBTC), a firm reportedly plagued by operational issues. Hut 8, however, claims the legal action stems from a short-seller campaign aimed at devaluing its stock for financial gain. Hut 8 Accuses J Capital Research of Orchestrating the Scheme In its Dec. 2 filing, Hut 8 accused J Capital Research, a short-selling firm, of orchestrating what it called a “short-and-distort” scheme. The company argued that J Capital’s January report, which alleged Hut 8 had overpaid for USBTC and concealed critical issues at a Texas mining facility, triggered a sharp decline in its stock value. Hut 8’s shares dropped 23% following the report, prompting multiple lawsuits in March from investors seeking compensation for their losses. Hut 8 asserts that the report misrepresented facts and contends that its stock has since rebounded, gaining approximately 300% from its January lows. The firm highlighted that it had disclosed USBTC’s limited operating history and noted that many of its forward-looking statements were protected under legal “safe harbor provisions.” The merger with USBTC, completed in November 2023, included a 50% interest in a Bitcoin mining facility in Texas.

The company maintained that the stock price’s recovery undermines the basis of the lawsuit. “These short-and-distort cases are regularly dismissed,” Hut 8 stated in its motion, urging the court to reject the shareholder complaint. It called for the case to be dismissed “in its entirety, with prejudice,” and requested additional relief as deemed appropriate by the court. Hut 8’s stock has shown remarkable resilience this year, climbing nearly 99% and trading at $25.06 as of Dec. 3. After-hours trading reflected a modest 0.5% uptick.

The rule mandates miners to disclose their facilities’ locations, ownership details, and electricity demand to the state agency. Under the regulation, Bitcoin miners must register within one working day of connecting to the ERCOT grid. The registration must also be renewed annually by March 1. Bitcoin miners failing to comply with the new requirements could face severe penalties. Violators will be charged with a Class A violation, carrying fines of up to $25,000 per day. In another development, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed a lawsuit against investment firm Touzi Capital, accusing it of defrauding investors and misrepresenting the liquidity and profitability of its crypto asset mining fund.

The show, though, belongs to a few altcoins once again, such as TRX and BNB, both of which have soared to new all-time highs. BTC Back to $97K After last week’s bounce-off from $91,000, the primary cryptocurrency went on the offensive and shot above $98,000 on Friday. However, the bears came out of the woods again at that point and didn’t allow another attempt at cracking into six-digit price territory. BTC slipped during the weekend and stood within a range between $96,000 and $97,000. Monday began with a brief surge past $98,000, which was met with tons of resistance that drove bitcoin south to under $95,000. Another volatile wave hit the market with a surge to $97,500 and a subsequent rejection to $94,500. A similar scenario repeated yesterday amid the brief martial law in South Korea, and BTC dumped to $93,500 this time, with warnings about an even more severe correction. However, the cryptocurrency headed in the opposite direction and now sits close to $97,000 after recovering over three grand since yesterday’s low. Its market cap has reclaimed the $1.9 trillion line, but its dominance over the alts has dumped again to 51.3% on CG. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 4.12.2024. Source: TradingView TRX, BNB at New Peaks As reported earlier, TRX emerged as today’s top performer as it skyrocketed by almost triple digits at one point and shot above $0.4 to mark a fresh all-time high. Binance Coin is another larger-cap asset that charted a new peak of almost $800. Other notable gainers from the larger-cap alts include AVAX, TON, DOT, BCH, ETC, and FIL. Ethereum has gained more than 3% and sits above $3,700. The total crypto market cap has added another $60 billion since yesterday and sits at a peak of its own at over $3.730 trillion on CG.

Scheduled to debut in 2025, Safenet aims to revolutionize crosschain payments by offering instant transactions with security and compliance protocols inspired by Visa’s global payment network, VisaNet. Inspired by Visa, Designed for Crypto “Transactions in crypto often lag, particularly in crosschain scenarios. Safenet addresses this challenge by creating a seamless and instantaneous experience,” said Safe co-founder Lukas Schor during the December 3 announcement. Unlike traditional blockchains, Safenet will function as a connecting layer between existing networks, allowing users to interact with various blockchains through a single account. It utilizes processors to facilitate transactions, implementing advanced features like fraud and compliance checks while reserving user assets through smart account resource locks. Expanding Functionality Safenet will debut with one processor handling crosschain accounts and liquidity but is designed to accommodate additional processors offering diverse services such as automation, subscriptions, and offchain balance connectivity. The system will also feature incentives for validators, who can stake SAFE tokens to earn transaction fees as rewards. Schor noted potential applications of Safenet’s capabilities, including under-collateralized loans . “A trusted processor could front users money, similar to a traditional bank offering a mortgage,” he explained. For instance, a user might leverage Safenet to secure financing for high-value assets like CryptoPunks , providing partial upfront payment while using the asset itself as collateral. The platform’s flexibility extends beyond payments, paving the way for processors to create innovative services within Safenet’s ecosystem. This could include offering liquidity to support users’ financial needs or developing compliance-driven solutions tailored to regulatory environments. Roadmap to Full Deployment Safenet’s rollout will occur in phases throughout 2025. An alpha version is expected in the first quarter, followed by the launch of its validator network in Q2. The protocol’s full version, featuring an open co-processor liquidity network, is slated for release in late 2025. By combining Visa-level efficiency with blockchain technology’s decentralized ethos , Safe’s Safenet aspires to set a new standard for crosschain interactions. “We’re building the infrastructure for a crypto experience that rivals traditional payment systems in speed and reliability,” Schor affirmed.

37213126,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=103877,1733307400,Bitcoin Jesus Roger Ver Seeks Dismissal of $50 Million Tax Evasion Indictment,"Roger Ver, widely known as ""Bitcoin Jesus,"" is at the center of a contentious legal battle following an indictment on criminal charges related to alleged tax evasion. The indictment, filed by U.S. authorities, accuses Ver of failing to pay nearly $50 million in taxes stemming from his sale of approximately $240 million worth of Bitcoin in 2017. Following his arrest in Spain earlier this year, Ver was released on bail and is awaiting possible extradition to the United States.According to a Fox Business’ Eleanor Terrett, Ver’s legal team is vigorously contesting the charges, arguing that the case is politically motivated and based on flawed evidence.Allegations and Indictment DetailsThe charges against Ver involve a series of alleged tax violations, including underreporting his Bitcoin holdings in 2014. The U.S. government claims that Ver intentionally misrepresented the value of his Bitcoin to avoid a higher ""exit tax"" when he renounced his U.S. citizenship and moved to Saint Kitts and Nevis. Additionally, the indictment accuses him of failing to report capital gains from the sale of his Bitcoin holdings in 2017. Ver’s legal team argues that these actions were based on professional legal advice and a lack of clear regulatory guidelines surrounding digital assets at the time. They assert that the tax obligations were complex, and Ver made every effort to comply with U.S. tax laws.Legal Defense and Motion to DismissIn response to the indictment, Ver’s attorneys have filed a motion to dismiss the charges, citing government overreach and violations of Ver's rights. The legal team claims that U.S. officials may have improperly obtained privileged attorney-client communications and withheld key information that could exonerate him. They further argue that the exit tax itself is unconstitutional and that the 2014 tax guidelines for digital assets were insufficiently clear to make a definitive tax ruling. Ver’s lawyers maintain that he relied on the expertise of top-tier law firms when planning his expatriation and tax strategy, which they believe should demonstrate his intent to comply with the law.Political Context and Future ProspectsThe case comes amid heightened scrutiny of the crypto industry, with observers speculating that Ver's outspoken criticism of U.S. government regulations on digital assets may have contributed to the charges. His legal team hopes that the incoming administration may dismiss the case as part of a broader shift in how the government approaches crypto regulation. Per Fox Business, civil rights attorney Robert Barnes, representing Ver, has expressed optimism that the new political landscape will reverse what he calls ""selective harassment"" of crypto figures. This change could also impact Ver’s extradition, with hopes that the new leadership will favor a more crypto-friendly stance.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/04/bitcoin-jesus-roger-ver-seeks-dismissal-of-50-million-tax-evasion-indictment/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-jesus-roger-ver-seeks-dismissal-of-50-million-tax-evasion-indictment,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

In a new CNBC interview, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee says Bitcoin’s scarcity is starting to be a problem for crypto exchanges. Lee says the dwindling supply of available BTC for sale will likely be felt once Bitcoin shatters the psychological price point of $100,000. “I think some of this could be – there’s a lot of folks who don’t want Bitcoin over $100,000 and some of it may be the exchanges themselves [that] are concerned, because there is a pretty low supply of Bitcoin available over the counter. So you have a supply shortage, and if Bitcoin makes a move above $100,000, I think there would be a big chase. So I’m still confident Bitcoin’s going to close much higher before year-end… Well above $100,000 before year-end. It’s just a matter of time.” Recently, Lee hopped on an interview with SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci to give his 12-month outlook for BTC. According to the Fundstrat executive, Bitcoin could witness up to 150% gains from current levels in just one year. “Over the next twelve months, I think something over $250,000 is possible, but maybe highly probable based on just following this price cycle.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $95,844.

Why is AMP price rising? There are three potential catalysts driving AMP’s recent rally. Firstly, AMP’s surge coincided with a broader rally in the altcoin market, as major cryptocurrencies like Binance Coin ( BNB ) and Tron ( TRX ) posted significantly higher daily gains of 17.6% and 68.8%, respectively, compared to Bitcoin’s modest 1.4% rise during the same period. Second, Flexa , a digital payments platform that uses AMP as collateral, recently announced its integration with the Zcash wallet app ‘Zashi.’ The integration allows users to make purchases at Flexa-enabled U.S. stores without revealing their wallet or currency details. You might also like: Bitcoin eyes $100,000 amid 74.5% probability of 25bps rate cut As more transactions occur on the platform, the demand for AMP to serve as collateral naturally increases. This reduces the token’s available supply, creating upward pressure on its price, which is potentially fueling growth for the altcoin. Third, AMP’s rally has been bolstered by a surge in whale activity over the past 24 hours. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that whale holder netflow jumped over 150%, shifting from a $186K outflow on Dec. 2 to $473K in inflows on Dec. 3, signaling renewed interest from large investors. AMP price, 50-day and 200-day SMA chart — Dec. 4 | Source: crypto.news Meanwhile, on the daily chart, AMP has risen above both the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages, indicating bulls are still in control. Further, the 50-day SMA has crossed over the 200-day SMA, forming a golden cross, a major bullish sign in technical analysis. AMP MACD chart — Dec. 4 | Source: crypto.news Further, the MACD line (blue) and the signal line (orange) on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator have been moving higher above the zero mark, which means the rally still holds significant momentum. Considering these signals, AMP could potentially continue its rally, a sentiment also echoed by analyst Javon Marks, who projected that AMP could climb to $0.07048—a potential increase of over 470% from its current price.

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-pepe-solana-memecoin-to-rally-19000-ahead-of-first-exchange-listing-as-shib-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37204664,https://crypto.news/?p=14316072,1733306505,"Bitcoin eyes $100,000 amid 74.5% probability of 25bps rate cut","Bitcoin price is under the spotlight as markets anticipate a potential Federal Reserve rate cut that could drive fresh momentum. Notably, the CME FedWatch Tool has indicated a 74.5% possibility of a 0.25% rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its forthcoming Dec. 18 meeting. This comes after the 50 bps rate cut in September and 25 bps last month. If it materializes, this move could lower the federal fund’s target rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. Such a cut, widely perceived as a dovish signal, will likely bolster the price action of Bitcoin and altcoins. The Fed’s anticipated shift follows months of inflation data that suggests prices are stabilizing. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller recently voiced support for the cut, citing downward inflation trends. Similarly, Federal Reserve officials, including Raphael Bostic, have hinted at an open mind on whether the bank should cut rates. Market expectations for such a cut have steadily risen in recent weeks. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin ( BTC ) price, which saw a massive uptrend in November, hit the $99,655 resistance on the path to $100,000 before facing a pullback driven by profit-taking trades from long-term holders. BTC now changes hands at $96,812 at press time, up 1.52% over the past 24 hours. The price has continued to consolidate between $93,000 and $96,000, suggesting the market awaits a major catalyst to push higher. You might also like: Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows surge 90%, closing in on Satoshi Nakamoto’s BTC holdings Speaking with crypto.news, Maksym Sakharov, co-founder of WeFi, argues that a dovish Fed move could provide the necessary momentum. He notes that rate cuts reduce borrowing costs and increase liquidity, conditions that historically favor Bitcoin due to its inflation-hedging appeal. “Freed-up liquidity often translates to more fiat in circulation, driving inflation concerns and prompting investors to seek stable alternatives like Bitcoin,” Sakharov observed. Additionally, Bitcoin’s price actions are supported by a mix of factors, including institutional interest. Sakharov emphasized that the limited supply created by the halving, coupled with increased accumulation, could drive a breakout above $100,000. He also pointed to the optimism surrounding pro-crypto policies from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump , a sentiment fueling market momentum. “Beyond these macroeconomic projections, the market is still hyped about the emergence of Donald Trump as US President. The optimism that a pro-crypto President will take charge for four years helped push the price of Bitcoin above the $99,000 mark.” Sakharov said. “The combined impacts of incoming rate cuts and sustained BTC accumulation by institutional investors can propel the coin’s price above the $100,000 mark this year,” Sakharov added. Notably, as the Federal Reserve’s meeting approaches, scheduled for December 17 and 18, market participants also have their eyes set on other economic indicators that could determine price action. Upcoming employment data and holiday sales trends will further inform the central bank’s decision. However, any unexpected signs of persistent inflation could temper the Fed’s dovish pivot and dampen Bitcoin’s bullish outlook. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

37204610,https://coinpaprika.com/news/shiba-inu-faces-volatility,1733306350,Shiba Inu Faces Volatility,"Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) has experienced a volatile week, gaining over 19% in seven days, cementing its position as the second-largest meme coin by market cap, just behind Dogecoin. However, mixed technical signals suggest both opportunities and risks for traders. SHIB’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), a key momentum indicator, has cooled significantly, dropping from overbought levels. This shift indicates reduced buying pressure and a possible consolidation phase. While an RSI decline from high levels often points to traders taking profits, it also signals a more balanced market, potentially paving the way for sustainable price movements. The behavior of SHIB's largest holders, known as whales, adds another layer of complexity. The number of whale addresses holding over 1 billion SHIB has dropped by 155 in the past month, suggesting that some large investors are offloading tokens after the recent price surge. This selling pressure could create short-term headwinds, but the redistribution of holdings among smaller investors may lead to greater decentralization, which is beneficial for long-term stability . On the technical side, SHIB has dipped below its shortest Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a signal that short-term bearish momentum may be building. Despite this, longer-term EMA trends remain positive, keeping the potential for a bullish reversal intact. The price is at a critical juncture where both correction and recovery scenarios are equally plausible. A bearish outcome could see SHIB test lower support levels, while renewed buying momentum might drive the price higher, potentially surpassing recent highs. For traders, SHIB’s current volatility offers both risks and opportunities. The market awaits a decisive move that will determine whether the coin continues its upward trajectory or enters a corrective phase.",NEUTRAL,SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/shiba-inu-faces-volatility,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37204610.jpeg

Bitcoin has been range bound, oscillating around $95,0000 since Nov. 20, two weeks ago. It has failed to register a new all-time high but remains in price discovery as long-term holders are “pumping the sell-side brakes,” said Check. Pumping The Bitcoin Brakes Right now, markets are approximately six times off the FTX cycle low, “and the market has hit resistance, chopped around, and corrected from similar levels in both of the prior cycles,” he added in a newsletter on Dec. 2. However, it has still powered onward to massively higher highs. The analyst compared the market to a car, with demand being the accelerator and sell-side pressure being the brakes. The demand is “pedal to the metal,” with Michael Saylor and the spot Bitcoin ETFs hammering the buy-side, he said before adding: “If the Long-Term Holders are pumping the sell-side brakes at an equal magnitude, the car isn’t going anywhere.” One of the biggest misconceptions in #Bitcoin is that HODLers and OGs never sell.

37204669,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622382,1733306059,Dubai’s virtual asset regulator issues alert against XT.com and six other crypto entities,"Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) has issued alerts for seven crypto entities claiming to be registered and licensed in Dubai. The entities include, Koto Crypto, Finchain, Crypto Force, Coin Cashy, BTC Bay, XT.com, and Stabit. The first entity, Koto Crypto based out of DMCC (Dubai Multi Commodities Center) which claims to be registered in DMCC Dubai, is carrying out non regulated virtual asset activities operating without a proper license. Based on press releases from Koto Crypto, they have been operating in Dubai as an OTC Crypto provider since 2023. As per the notice , “Any activities related to virtual assets conducted on this platform are therefore not in compliance with VARA Regulations. Engaging with unlicensed platforms that are not in compliance with VARA Regulations exposes users to significant financial risks and potential legal consequences for violating regulatory requirements, or criminal laws.” The same applies to Finchain Payment Service Provider L.L.C. and Finchain Technologies DMCC, which also claim to be registered in DMCC. Moreover, the Finchain website is no longer operational, claiming they are undergoing maintenance. Vara also mentioned Crypto Force, which is registered in DMCC and conducting unregulated virtual asset activities. In addition, VARA issued alerts for Coin Cashy , BTC Bay , whose website is no longer active. As for the 7th crypto entity put under alert status, Stabit, which is associated with Genesis Digital Assets Commercial Brokers Co. L.L.C, also offering un-regulated crypto trading services. XT.com was recently hacked for $1.7 million XT (XT.com), one of the non-regulated crypto entities under the VARA alert, with almost half a million followers on X, recently suspended withdrawals on November 28 th , after suspecting $1.7 million hack. The exchange suspended withdrawals, citing “wallet upgrade and maintenance.” The statement was issued about an hour before blockchain security firm PeckShield reported that XT.com “appeared to have been hacked” for $1.7 million worth of cryptocurrency. XT.com subsequently issued a statement acknowledging an “abnormal transfer of platform wallet assets.” The exchange tried to assure users that they would not be affected. According to PeckShield data, the suspected XT.com hacker had already swapped funds stolen from the exchange for 461.58 Ether. VARA calls on users not to deal with these 7 entities All these entities are unlicensed as per VARA and, as such, are not operating legally in the jurisdiction. As such any promotion, advertising, or solicitation related to these seven entities has not been approved by VARA, and the platform is therefore prohibited from offering, promoting, or marketing any virtual asset products or services in Dubai or to its residents. VARA advised investors and consumers to avoid using them and to exercise caution when considering interactions with unregulated platforms. The regulator also notified users that access to these websites might be restricted without prior notice. As per the regulator, “It is recommended to take immediate necessary measures to ensure protection of user assets.” The alerts come after VARA announced in October that it issued cease-and-desist orders, along with accompanying fines, to 7 entities for operating without the required licenses and for breaching marketing regulations. VARA fines 18 entities for failing to comply with regulations On November 17th 2023, VARA shared that 18 Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), commercially licensed on mainland under Dubai’s Department of Economy and Tourism (DET) have thus far, been issued fines for failing to comply with VARA’s directives and regulatory guidance. As per the regulator, these enforcement actions are a pre-requisite to remedy compliance breaches and assure global markets that VARA’s regime can be trusted to have consistency and resilience in deployment. The Dubai regulator noted that if these regulatory gaps are not actively addressed by year-end, further penalties will apply.

37204422,https://coinpaprika.com/news/bitcoin-jesus-roger-ver-fights-us-tax-charges,1733306016,Bitcoin Jesus Roger Ver Fights US Tax Charges,"Roger Ver, widely known as ""Bitcoin Jesus"" for his early advocacy of Bitcoin , is challenging U.S. tax evasion charges that accuse him of avoiding $48 million in taxes and filing a false tax return. Ver, 45, was arrested in February while attending a cryptocurrency conference in Barcelona and is awaiting a Spanish court’s decision on his extradition to the U.S. The charges stem from the sale of $240 million in cryptocurrencies and an “exit tax” tied to Ver renouncing his U.S. citizenship in 2014. His legal team argues that the case is politically motivated, labeling it part of the Biden administration’s heavy-handed approach to crypto enforcement. They claim the charges are an attempt to regulate the cryptocurrency industry through prosecution rather than clear policy guidelines. Critics in the crypto community view Ver’s arrest as an example of targeting prominent figures to set a precedent. Author Bret Weinstein described the case as unjust, stating Ver’s “crime” was promoting decentralized technologies that empower individuals. Ver has long been an outspoken advocate for Bitcoin and decentralized finance, calling for reduced government involvement in financial systems. Despite his significant contributions to cryptocurrency, including early investments in Ripple Labs, BitPay, and Kraken, Ver is no stranger to legal battles. He has faced multiple lawsuits from crypto firms like Genesis and ConFLEX, and his recent arrest has reignited debates over U.S. crypto regulations and their impact on industry pioneers. The government has recently taken a strong stance against high-profile crypto figures. Former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky and associates of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried have all faced successful prosecutions, reflecting increased scrutiny of the industry. Born in the U.S., Ver moved to Japan in 2006 and became a citizen of Saint Kitts and Nevis in 2014. Known for promoting Bitcoin when it was worth less than $1, Ver frequently gave away BTC to encourage adoption.

XRP continues its bullish swing, which was recorded this month as the price hit levels not seen in several years. The recent positive sentiments drove the wider market cap above $3.6 trillion, surging 3.5% in the last 24 hours. A look at crypto charts shows XRP ahead in terms of daily gains among the top 10 assets by market cap. XRP trades at $2.65, recording 89% inflows and taking its market cap to $150 billion. Although daily trading volume remains in the red zone, XRP bulls show signs of a recovery. In a longer time frame, the asset posted 33% gains in the last seven days, wiping out losses seen earlier this week. Similarly, monthly numbers are up 182% as experts tips further bullish sentiments. Charts Show Bull Flag Pattern The recent trading pattern shows the price action forming a bull flag in a 24-hour window. From this, the asset is expected to breach the present mark and rise to new levels. While this seems a far stretch with an upper bull target at $4.25, sharp swings in the last 30 days have ignited institutional interest. Higher open interest is another factor pointing north for XRP bulls as traders use it to assess market sentiments. Since Donald Trump’s success at the US Presidential polls, figures have increased as users anticipate more institutional interest . In previous years, XRP traded at new lows due to the SEC’s lawsuit weakening sentiments. With anticipated clear rules, the asset continues to record inflows. This market trend also affected other assets after Bitcoin surged to new all-time highs, currently trading at $96,941.

This decision is part of DCG’s broader strategy to streamline Foundry’s operations while focusing resources on new ventures, including Yuma, an AI ecosystem accelerator launched by DCG founder Barry Silbert. The layoffs impacted a significant portion of Foundry’s 250 employees, with 20 reassigned to Yuma and most others dismissed. The company’s hardware team was entirely cut, and Foundry is reportedly considering selling its mining site operations team. Despite these challenges, Foundry’s core mining pool operations remain intact. Bitcoin mining has faced increasing challenges due to higher mining difficulty and reduced profitability, particularly following the halving event earlier this year. These factors have pushed many mining companies, including Foundry, to reevaluate their operational efficiency. While Foundry still ranks among the largest Bitcoin mining pools globally, controlling a significant share of the hash rate alongside AntPool, the industry’s financial pressure is evident. DCG’s recent history includes financial troubles, such as lawsuits from its subsidiary Genesis over unpaid loans and the sale of CoinDesk . However, not all DCG entities are struggling—Silbert’s launch of Yuma suggests a pivot toward AI and new technologies as a way to diversify the group’s business interests. Foundry’s financial health remains unclear. DCG’s Q3 2024 shareholder letter projected $80 million in revenue for Foundry, but the layoffs suggest underlying challenges.

Interestingly, the value has skyrocketed by 128.89% in less than four months to $1.67 million. This follows a surge in Shiba Inu’s price, which began last month after the U.S. election.

Gambardello shared his views in a recent post on X, highlighting the potential impact of ETF-related developments on ADA’s market value. Gambardello emphasized that Cardano already benefits from numerous positive developments within its ecosystem, although he did not provide specific examples. According to the analyst, favorable ETF news could catalyze ADA’s price to the next level. Cardano has a lot going for it right now. But on top of it all, if Cardano has similar ETF news as $XRP , please take note how fast $ADA hits $3. — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) December 2, 2024 Cardano (ADA) Position in the ETF Landscape Unlike XRP and Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA) has yet to gain ETF filings. Recently, the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has sparked discussions about which other assets might follow. Industry experts have identified ADA, XRP, and Solana as potential candidates for ETF adoption. Despite this optimism, XRP and Solana lead in this aspect. Multiple asset managers, including WisdomTree , Bitwise , Canary Capital, and 21Shares, have submitted applications for ETFs linked exclusively to XRP. In contrast, ADA’s representation in ETF filings is limited to a basket fund managed by Bitwise. Bitwise’s application involves converting the Bitwise 10 Crypto Fund (BITW) into an exchange-traded product (ETP). This fund includes ten prominent cryptocurrencies, such as XRP and Cardano (ADA) with weightings of 5.7% and 1.6%, respectively. In addition, Grayscale Investments has sought to convert its multi-coin fund, which also features XRP, into an ETF. While these developments showcase growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, Cardano remains underrepresented in ETF-related initiatives compared to XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Market Performance and Institutional Interest XRP’s recent surge has been fueled by significant institutional backing and multiple ETF filings . In the past 30 days, XRP has experienced a remarkable price increase of over 470%, climbing from $0.4937 to $2.85. This growth is attributed to increasing investor confidence driven by exclusive ETF applications. Although Cardano experienced a substantial price rally recently, it still lags behind XRP in terms of performance and gains. ADA’s value has risen by over 270% within the same period, moving from $0.32 to $1.32. In summary, while XRP currently leads in ETF filings and price gains, Cardano holds the potential for significant growth if it garners comparable institutional support. Gambardello’s insights underscore the importance of ETF filings as a potential driver for ADA’s market performance, providing a glimpse into what might lie ahead for the asset.

Backed is tokenizing the fund by creating permissionless tokens. The asset tokenization pioneer's solution features 1:1 fund unit collateral, with the price pegged to the real-time Net Asset Value or NAV. This means the tokens are ready to be deployed within Sonic's ecosystem. Previously known as Fantom, the high-speed EVM L1 blockchain provides appealing incentives and powerful infrastructure to developers. Chainlink is well-known as the golden standard for blockchain finance. Its SmartData will deliver the underlying fund shares' NAV data to the blockchain, while Chainlink CCIP will allow for seamless cross-chain operations and liquidity. Chainlink Proof of Reserves will help verify AUM and collateralization. Sonic is widely recognized for its focus on developer experience, cutting-edge consensus mechanism, and transaction speed: 10,000 transactions per second at one-second finality. For these reasons, it is a popular choice for DeFi protocols and other decentralized applications. It is well-suited as a platform for tokenizing real-world assets thanks to its ability to handle a high transaction volume with minimal latency. Fortlake won in the Fixed Income category at the 2024 Fund Manager of the Year awards in Australia. Sigma Opportunities Fund, an actively managed international fixed-income product and investment strategy, targets a minimum of 7% above the federal funds rate, up to 10%. The impressive returns are achieved by leveraging market distortions. The fund's active fixed-income investment returns have amounted to 10% so far in 2024. Adam Levi at Backed described the tokenization of Fortlake's Sigma Fund as a milestone in the blockchain landscape. It demonstrates how institutions can leverage blockchain tech to streamline back-office operations and attain capital on higher levels. The partnership reflects the platforms' commitment to transforming financial asset trade and management. Fortlake's Sigma Fund is the flagship fund to go through Backed's Tokenization-as-a-Service (TaaS) platform. The accomplishment emphasizes Backed's expansion into private tokenization, and the platform will continue to offer similar solutions for other financial institutions. Backed will explore new opportunities to broaden its services, giving the blockchain ecosystem improved access to tokenized assets and greater flexibility. Colin Cunningham, Head of Tokenization & Alliances at Chainlink Labs, is excited by the prospect of working with Fortlake and Backed on the first real-world assets tokenized on Sonic. He hopes Chainlink, as the standard for on-chain finance, will assist in driving the adoption, liquidity, and utility of Fortlake's tokenized fund. Sonic's Business Development Lead, Sam Harcourt, labeled the partnership as one of Sonic's first steps in its journey to tokenizing financial assets worldwide and bringing the advantages of its technology to TradFi. Christian Baylis, Founder and CIO of Fortlake described the collaboration with Sonic, Backed, and Chainlink to tokenize Sigma as a significant development. Specifically, Fortlake is providing its rapidly growing body of digital asset investors with alleviated access to its fund. This is why Baylis believes the partnership marks the beginning of a new epoch in conventional asset management fundraising. Tokenizing Sigma Fund will lead to new opportunities within DeFi, such as margin trading collateral, high-yield stablecoin savings, and integrations with lending markets. World-leading asset manager BlackRock recently joined the tokenization race, and other platforms are following suit, keen to explore new opportunities in the space. JP Morgan, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and other institutions' tokenization experiments have enabled significant savings through blockchain-based tokenization. According to the Bank of America, the asset tokenization market could exceed $16 trillion in as little as five years from now. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In a detailed blog post, the Ethereum co-founder highlighted the need for wallets that align with blockchain’s core principles, gaining support from major industry players like Coinbase and Uniswap. Buterin stressed that Ethereum's success as a decentralized platform relies heavily on the quality of wallets users depend on. He proposed advanced features like social recovery and stealth addresses, aiming to make wallets both secure and user-friendly. Social recovery, for instance, allows users to assign trusted individuals to help recover lost private keys, addressing a significant challenge in wallet security. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong echoed this sentiment, expressing interest in integrating such features into Coinbase Wallet. Privacy enhancements also play a central role in Buterin’s vision. He highlighted tools like Waku and zero-knowledge proof technologies (ZK-SNARKs) that could improve transaction confidentiality and protect sensitive information. Innovative solutions like Myna Wallet and Zkemail were showcased as examples of integrating privacy-friendly IDs into Ethereum addresses. These approaches allow users to verify ownership without revealing personal data, reinforcing the ethos of blockchain transparency and privacy. Uniswap has already begun implementing Buterin’s ideas by introducing features like in-app bridging and cross-layer token swaps. The decentralized exchange announced its collaboration on ERC-7683, a protocol for seamless swaps between Ethereum’s main network and Layer 2 solutions. These upgrades aim to enhance usability and streamline decentralized finance ( DeFi ) interactions. While Buterin also touched on futuristic concepts like AI-driven wallet defense systems, he acknowledged that such ideas remain impractical with current technology. For now, the focus lies on practical, immediate improvements that can strengthen Ethereum’s foundation. Buterin’s proposals mark a shift in how wallets are designed, with industry leaders like Coinbase and Uniswap taking steps to adopt these innovations. These changes could redefine the way users interact with blockchain networks, paving the way for a more secure and user-friendly decentralized future.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | UNI,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/vitalik-buterin-s-vision:-safer-smarter-ethereum-wallets,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37204159.jpeg

37204017,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98321,1733304940,Solana Gearing Up For Dizzying Rally As Crypto Giant Grayscale Files For Spot SOL ETF,"Digital assets behemoth Grayscale has become the latest entrant into the Solana ETF race as it seeks to convert its existing Solana Trust (GSOL) into a spot SOL exchange-traded fund. Grayscale’s filing highlights growing institutional confidence in Solana, following in the footsteps of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which scored their own ETFs on Wall Street earlier this year. Grayscale Files For SOL ETF In US According to a 19b-4 form submitted Tuesday, Grayscale seeks to improve investor access to the SOL cryptocurrency by allowing shares of the Solana Trust to trade as an ETF on a regulated exchange. Grayscale noted that the ETF conversion would improve SOL’s price tracking and remove inefficiencies caused by its unlisted structure. If approved, the Trust would trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker GSOL. The filing indicates that the Grayscale Solana Trust is “the world’s largest investment fund by assets under management”, holding at least $134 million in AUM. Grayscale claims the Solana held in the trust is roughly 0.1% of the total SOL in circulation. Coinbase Custody was named the custodian for Grayscale’s spot SOL ETF, while BNY Mellon Asset Servicing is the fund’s administrator and transfer agent. Grayscale is now the fifth asset manager that has made its SOL ETF application official with the SEC, following VanEck , 21Shares , Canary Capital , and Bitwise . Franklin Templeton has also expressed interest in vying for a spot SOL ETF but is yet to formally submit paperwork to the SEC. A spot Solana exchange-traded fund would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to SOL without requiring them to buy and store the token themselves. The price of SOL, alongside other cryptocurrencies, has rocketed higher following pro-crypto Donald Trump’s historic comeback on Nov. 6. His re-election promises a more lenient regulatory environment for the fast-growing crypto industry. Adding to investors’ optimism on the likelihood of spot Solana ETFs notching federal approval to start trading in the U.S. is the imminent departure of current SEC chair, Gary Gensler. Under Gensler’s leadership, the SEC named SOL as an unregistered security in separate lawsuits it filed against Kraken , Binance , and Coinbase . SOL gained roughly 4.4% after Grayscale’s filing and is up over 135% on a year-to-date basis.",POSITIVE,SOL,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/solana-gearing-up-for-dizzying-rally-as-crypto-giant-grayscale-files-for-spot-sol-etf/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

So What's the Reason for the Rise? Analysts Explained!","While XRP has been sweeping the market with its unstoppable rise in recent days, many altcoins are expected to be next in line. At this point, Tron (TRX) founder Justin Sun stated in his posts that TRX would be the next XRP and what he said came true. Related News: What's Happening With Tron? Will It Be The Next XRP? What's The Source Of The Rise As TRX Breaks Records? TRX has increased by 70% in the last 24 hours and reached $0.40. While this rise of TRX made a big impact on the market, it is thought that the TRX rally is due to political instability in South Korea. As is known, according to the news received yesterday evening, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol declared a state of emergency for the first time in 40 years. Evaluating the rise in Tron, BTC Markets analyst Rachael Lucas attributed the rise to the political turmoil and events in South Korea. Lucas noted that TRX is widely used to transfer funds between exchanges in the country, and that trading restrictions on Korean platforms due to political unrest may have prompted investors to move their assets to other exchanges, which in turn may have increased demand for TRX. “The recent rally in Tron (TRX) appears to be partly due to political instability in South Korea. TRX’s role as a widely used transfer token across exchanges, particularly in South Korea, makes it a widely used tool for investors looking to move funds quickly between platforms. This has increased demand and price.” Presto Research analyst Min Jung also noted that political events in South Korea may have contributed to TRX’s rise, but it is unlikely to be the sole reason. He said that this surge in Tron is part of a broader bullish trend, with legacy cryptocurrencies like XRP experiencing cyclical gains and tokens like IOTA and VET also seeing recent increases. *Not investment advice.

37203855,https://coinpaper.com/6370/hydra-founder-stanislav-moiseev-sentenced-to-life-in-prison,1733304757,Hydra Founder Stanislav Moiseev Sentenced to Life in Prison,"Some of Moiseev’s accomplices received sentences of up to 23 years. Meanwhile, other well known crypto figures are also facing legal challenges. Roger Ver is battling U.S. tax evasion charges that could result in a 30-year sentence, while ex-Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky pleaded guilty to fraud and price manipulation. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also recently urged the crypto industry to reject law firms hiring anti-crypto officials in resistance against regulatory hostility. Hydra Founder and Accomplices Sentenced Stanislav Moiseev, the founder of the infamous online black market and crypto mixing service Hydra, has been sentenced to life imprisonment by a Russian court. The Moscow Regional Court found Moiseev and 15 of his accomplices guilty of organizing a criminal community and the illegal production and sale of psychotropic substances and drugs. The court's decision was announced on Dec. 2 by the Moscow Prosecutor’s Office, and also included sentences for his accomplices ranging from 8 to 23 years in prison. Moiseev was fined $38,100 as well, or 4 million rubles, while his co-defendants were ordered to pay a collective $152,400. As part of the sentencing, properties and vehicles linked to the convicted people were confiscated. According to the Russian media outlet TASS , the sentences will be served in correctional colonies under very strict regimes. Hydra operated from 2015 until its shutdown in 2022, and was the largest darknet marketplace globally. In fact, it was responsible for 80% of all darknet-related crypto transactions in 2021. Over its operational years, Hydra facilitated the exchange of more than $5.2 billion in crypto, according to the United States Department of Justice. The platform was especially known for its sale of illegal items, including stolen credit card information, counterfeit currencies, and fraudulent identity documents. Hydra's operations became increasingly sophisticated over the years, and its cryptocurrency volumes on exchanges grew by 624% between 2018 and 2020, according to a 2021 report from Flashpoint and TRM Labs. Hydra crypto volumes between 2016 and 2020 (Source: Flashpoint ) The marketplace's downfall came in April of 2022, when German authorities dismantled its infrastructure and seized its Bitcoin servers based in the country. German law enforcement also reported that Hydra had 17 million customers and 19,000 vendor accounts at the time of its shutdown. Additionally, authorities confiscated almost a ton of narcotic and psychotropic substances. Hydra has been under investigation by Russia's Ministry of Internal Affairs since 2016. The other people sentenced in the case included Alexander Chirkov, Andrei Trunov, Evgeny Andreev, Ivan Koryakin, Vadim Krasninsky, Georgy Kierobiani, Artur Kolesnikov, Nikolai Bilyk, Alekandr Kabalina, Mikhail Dombrovkogo, Alexander Aminova, and Sergey Czech. The convictions and sentences are subject to appeal. Unfortunately, darknet marketplaces still thrive, and their revenues reached at least $1.7 billion in 2023, according to Chainalysis . Roger Ver Battles Federal Tax Evasion Charges Other people involved in the crypto space are also butting heads with the law. Roger Ver , who is widely known as ”Bitcoin Jesus,” filed a motion in a California federal court to dismiss allegations of tax evasion brought against him by United States prosecutors. Ver argues that the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) “exit tax,” which applies to U.S. citizens with more than $2 million in assets renouncing their citizenship, is unconstitutional. In his Dec. 3 filing , Ver claimed the tax violates the Constitution's Apportionment and Due Process Clauses and described the relevant tax provisions as ”inscrutably vague” regarding digital assets. The exit tax is designed to make sure that citizens fulfill their tax obligations before renouncing citizenship. However, Ver believes that prosecutors ignored key evidence, including documents proving he did not intend to file a fraudulent tax return, and that one of his lawyers was unlawfully interrogated. The case stems from allegations that were made by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Los Angeles, which accused Ver of evading more than $48 million in taxes by failing to report capital gains from selling tens of thousands of Bitcoin for $240 million in cash. Ver was later arrested in Spain on April 30. Ver claimed the exit tax process was slowed down by practical challenges, including the lack of liquid Bitcoin markets at the time. Nonetheless, the U.S. government holds firm that Ver filed a fraudulent tax return after renouncing his U.S. citizenship in favor of Japanese citizenship in 2014. Ver faces charges of tax evasion, mail fraud, and filing false tax returns, which collectively carry a maximum sentence of up to 30 years in federal prison if he is convicted. Ver has been an advocate for Bitcoin since 2011, and gained a lot of recognition for promoting the cryptocurrency when it was still valued under $1. He later became a leading proponent of Bitcoin Cash after the 2017 Bitcoin network hard fork. However, Ver’s reputation has been marred by controversy, including a 2022 dispute with CoinFlex. The company claimed he owed the platform $47 million in USD Coin. Ver also served 10 months in federal prison in 2002 and 2003 for selling explosives on eBay. Ex-Celsius CEO Pleads Guilty Alex Mashinsky, the former CEO of Celsius Network, reached a plea agreement with United States prosecutors. Mashinsky pleaded guilty to commodities fraud and a scheme to manipulate the price of the CEL token. This happened after a failed bid by Mashinsky's legal team to have the charges dismissed. During a conference in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on Dec. 3, Mashinsky acknowledged his actions , including making false statements about Celsius' Earn Program, which misled investors and resulted in him profiting approximately $42 million. Mashinsky also admitted to falsely claiming that Celsius had regulatory approval and to misleading statements about not selling his CEL tokens. After accepting full responsibility for these actions, he entered a plea agreement that reduced his charges from seven to two years. Each charge carries a maximum sentence of 15 years, which could potentially amount to 30 years if served consecutively. His sentencing is scheduled for April 8. The plea deal was made after Judge John Koeltl rejected arguments from Mashinsky’s legal team, and ruled that their motions to dismiss were either moot or lacked merit. Before the plea agreement, Mashinsky maintained his innocence and was released on a $40-million bond. His trial was initially set for January of 2025. Mashinsky’s case makes him one of many high-profile crypto executives facing potential prison time, including former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who received a 25-year sentence, and Binance’s ex-CEO Changpeng Zhao. CZ pleaded guilty and served four months. Mashinsky stepped down as Celsius CEO in September of 2022 due to increasing scrutiny of the platform's operations. Roni Cohen-Pavon, Celsius’ former chief revenue officer, also pleaded guilty to charges related to CEL price manipulation in September of 2023 and is set to be sentenced on Dec. 11. Coinbase Urges Crypto Industry to Reject Anti-Crypto Officials Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced that the crypto exchange will no longer work with law firms that employ people who were involved in what he described as anti-crypto actions during their government service. In a post on Dec. 3, Armstrong criticized lawmakers' efforts to undermine the crypto industry without providing any clear regulations and called on the broader crypto community to avoid supporting these individuals. He believes there is a need to hold law firms accountable, and encouraged people to recognize that hiring former officials with anti-crypto agendas could lead to losing business from industry players. Armstrong specifically mentioned Coinbase's decision to sever ties with the law firm Milbank after it hired Gurbir Grewal , who was the former enforcement director of the U.S. SEC. Grewal resigned from the SEC in October, and was involved in recommending more than 100 enforcement actions that targeted noncompliance in the digital asset industry. Milbank welcomed Grewal to its litigation and arbitration group, and its chairman praised his career achievements. However, Armstrong argued that Grewal’s tenure at the SEC was far from ordinary and that senior officials cannot claim to have been merely following orders during their time at the agency. The announcement was made amidst growing optimism in the crypto community after Donald Trump’s 2024 U.S. presidential election victory. Many people now believe this could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment.",NEGATIVE,없음,BCH | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | FORKS,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6370/hydra-founder-stanislav-moiseev-sentenced-to-life-in-prison,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png
37203857,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=106829,1733304704,TRX Surges 80% to $0.44 Amid Political Instability in South Korea,"TRX Jumps 80% Amid South Korea’s Political Turmoil: What’s Behind the Rally? The cryptocurrency market has witnessed another major rally as TRX, the native token of the Tron blockchain network , surged by 80% to $0.44 on the morning of December 4, 2024. Analysts are attributing this dramatic increase to a confluence of factors, with South Korea’s ongoing political instability taking center stage. How South Korea’s Political Instability Is Driving TRX Demand According to Rachael Lucas , a cryptocurrency analyst at BTC Markets, TRX’s price jump is closely linked to political turmoil in South Korea , where it plays a crucial role in cryptocurrency trading. TRX is commonly used for transferring assets between exchanges in the country. Amid heightened political unrest, restrictions on local crypto platforms have prompted traders to shift their holdings to international exchanges, spurring demand for TRX. South Korea is a key hub for cryptocurrency activity, and disruptions in its trading ecosystem often have ripple effects across global markets. Traders are utilizing TRX to bypass limitations, which explains the sudden spike in trading volume and price. Broader Trends Contributing to TRX’s Rally While political events may have catalyzed TRX’s rise, Min Jung , an analyst at Presto Research, believes the surge is part of a larger pattern. She pointed out that legacy cryptocurrencies like XRP and IOTA have also seen notable gains recently, suggesting a rotational trend within the market. Legacy Cryptocurrencies Are Back in the Spotlight Legacy tokens, including TRX, XRP, IOTA, and VET, have garnered renewed investor interest. Min Jung attributes this to a shift in sentiment as traders look for established cryptocurrencies with proven use cases, especially during times of volatility. TRX’s Role in the Crypto Ecosystem A Preferred Token for Transfers TRX has carved out a niche as a reliable and cost-effective token for moving assets across exchanges. Its low transaction fees and fast processing times make it particularly attractive in high-volume trading environments, like those seen in South Korea. Tron Network’s Growing Influence The Tron blockchain network , spearheaded by Justin Sun, continues to expand its influence in decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized applications (dApps). This ecosystem growth supports TRX’s underlying value and utility, further fueling its price action. Examining TRX’s Technical Performance Market Metrics Supporting the Surge Trading Volume: TRX’s trading volume spiked by over 200% in the past 24 hours, signaling heightened investor interest. Market Cap: The token’s market capitalization reached $4.3 billion, reinforcing its position as a top-tier cryptocurrency. Technical Indicators: TRX broke through key resistance levels, setting the stage for continued bullish momentum. Potential Resistance Levels While TRX’s 80% surge is impressive, analysts caution that the token faces resistance around $0.50, a psychological threshold that could trigger profit-taking. South Korea’s Political Turmoil: What’s Happening? South Korea is currently grappling with significant political instability, marked by protests and policy disputes. These events have affected the nation’s financial markets, including its robust cryptocurrency sector. Impact on Local Crypto Platforms Political unrest has led to increased regulatory scrutiny and temporary trading restrictions on local cryptocurrency platforms. Traders are responding by moving assets to international platforms, leveraging TRX for its speed and low costs. Global Ripple Effects The South Korean crypto market’s importance cannot be understated. Shifts in trading behavior within the country often influence global market dynamics, as seen in TRX’s recent rally. Can TRX Sustain Its Gains? Short-Term Momentum TRX’s price surge has been fueled by unique circumstances, including South Korea’s political situation and broader market trends. While these factors have created short-term momentum, sustaining this growth will depend on continued demand and positive sentiment. Long-Term Outlook Analysts like Min Jung emphasize that TRX’s long-term potential lies in its utility within the Tron ecosystem and its adoption in DeFi applications. If the network continues to innovate, TRX could see sustained growth beyond this temporary spike. What This Means for the Broader Crypto Market The TRX rally underscores the influence of geopolitical events on cryptocurrency markets. It also highlights the growing role of legacy cryptocurrencies in providing stability and liquidity during uncertain times. Implications for Investors For investors, TRX’s performance serves as a reminder of the importance of monitoring both market trends and external factors, such as political developments, that can drive sudden price movements. Conclusion: A New Chapter for TRX Amid Market Volatility The 80% surge in TRX’s value is a testament to the complex interplay between geopolitical events, market trends, and cryptocurrency fundamentals. South Korea’s political instability has undoubtedly played a role in this rally, but the broader resurgence of legacy tokens like TRX and XRP suggests deeper market dynamics at work. Whether this momentum can be sustained remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: TRX has cemented its position as a key player in the cryptocurrency landscape.

37203809,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656548,1733304657,"Ethereum Price Dips, But Analysts Predict Explosive Surge to $15,000—Here’s Why","Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has experienced another downturn in its price. Following an earlier attempt at bullish momentum last week, Ethereum has dropped by 2.4% in the past 24 hours, trading at $3,577 at the time of writing. This decline puts Ethereum at a 26.8% decrease from its all-time high of $4,878, recorded in November 2021. Despite this, the network’s daily trading volume remains quite strong, registering $42.4 billion—a significant increase from late last month when volumes dipped below $35 billion. Related Reading: Ethereum Risk-Reward Ratio Is Now Attractive, Brokerage Firm Explains Chart Patterns Indicate Potential Rally While Ethereum’s current price trajectory may appear discouraging, analysts within the cryptocurrency community have expressed optimism regarding its long-term potential. Several technical indicators and chart patterns have emerged, leading some analysts to predict a significant rally for the asset in the coming months. One notable voice among the bullish analysts is CryptoBullet, a widely followed figure in the cryptocurrency space. In a recent post on X, the analyst highlighted a “cup and handle” formation on Ethereum’s monthly price chart. According to CryptoBullet, this pattern suggests that Ethereum could surge to new highs, potentially reaching $6,675. The analyst commented, “Did you guys see the $ETH monthly chart? Bullish AF. This month, we’re going to SMASH through the resistance. Cup&Handle Target – $6675.” Adding to the optimism, Venture Founder, another prominent analyst, projected an even more ambitious target for Ethereum. In a detailed analysis, the venture founder noted that Ethereum has been in a “triangular consolidation phase” for the past three years, a pattern reminiscent of its behavior from 2016 to 2017. The analyst predicted that Ethereum could break out of this consolidation and enter a new price paradigm, estimating a target of $15,937 by May 2025.

Grayscale and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) have applied for a Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF). In a Tuesday filing, the asset manager filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert its Solana Trust investment product to an ETF.The $13 trillion asset management firm disclosed in the filing that it intends to list the ETF product on the NYSE Arca. Per the 19b-4 filing, the fund will track Solana's price performance and reward its holders accordingly.Notably, Grayscale launched the Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL) in November 2021, with the fund recently accruing an asset under management (AUM) of $134 million. However, the fund is only traded on the over-the-counter (OTC) market, limiting its investor reach.With the filing, the asset manager aims to broaden the fund’s reach to potential investors, providing alternative means of exposure to the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.Grayscale Forays into Solana ETFThe Tuesday filing ensured that Grayscale became the fifth asset manager to file for a Solana ETF. Ark’s 21Shares and VanEck were the first to indicate interest in the product, with Bitwise and Canary Capital joining the bandwagon later.Notably, Grayscale played an essential role in approving the Bitcoin spot ETF in January, with its lawsuit against the SEC catalyzing a change of heart among the agency’s hierarchy. The asset manager also has an Ethereum spot ETF, which started trading months back.Meanwhile, analysts expect positive outcomes on the ETF approval front following Donald Trump’s win and Gary Gensler’s expected resignation. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas earlier asserted that the Solana ETF would not see the light of day unless there is a change in the White House and the SEC hierarchy.ETF Filing Boosts Solana’s PriceFollowing the filing, Solana surged considerably, reaching an intraday high of $240.9 today. However, the asset trades at $235.93 at the time of writing.Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick earlier argued that the Solana ETF, which Trump’s win will facilitate, will spur a fivefold increase in Solana’s price. The market expert insisted that Solana would outperform Ethereum and Bitcoin in this cycle if the SEC approved the SOL ETF.Hence, Grayscale’s entrance has steered the community, swelling bullish sentiments around the Solana ecosystem. Meanwhile, veteran Peter Brandt speculated that SOL would target $274 next",POSITIVE,SOL,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/04/grayscale-files-to-convert-its-solana-trust-to-an-etf/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=grayscale-files-to-convert-its-solana-trust-to-an-etf,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
37203647,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=106834,1733304283,"35% of BSC Blocks Affected by Sandwich Attacks on December 1, Impacting $1.5 Billion","BSC Under Fire: 35% of Blocks Impacted by Sandwich Attacks On December 1, 2024, 35.5% of BNB Smart Chain (BSC) blocks were targeted by sandwich attacks , according to a report by Decrypt , citing data from Dune Analytics . These sophisticated attacks manipulated the mempool (memory pool), affecting 43,400 transactions and a trading volume exceeding $1.5 billion . The revelation raises pressing concerns about blockchain security , with BSC users and developers calling for immediate action. Meanwhile, Binance, the entity behind BSC, has yet to release a statement addressing the incident. What Are Sandwich Attacks? Mechanics of a Sandwich Attack A sandwich attack is a form of DeFi (decentralized finance) exploitation where attackers front-run and back-run a victim’s transaction. Here’s how it works: Front-Run: The attacker places a buy order ahead of the victim’s transaction. Victim’s Order: The victim’s transaction is executed, causing a price increase for the targeted token. Back-Run: The attacker immediately places a sell order to profit from the artificially inflated price. This manipulation capitalizes on the mempool, where pending transactions wait to be processed by the blockchain. By analyzing and exploiting this pool, attackers can time their trades to trap victims. Key Statistics from the Attack Percentage of Impacted Blocks: 35.5% of all BSC blocks on December 1 contained at least one sandwich attack. Transactions Affected: 43,400 transactions fell victim to this manipulation. Volume Impacted: The total trading volume affected was over $1.5 billion, showcasing the scale of the exploit. Why BSC Was Targeted The BNB Smart Chain (BSC) is one of the largest blockchain ecosystems, known for its low transaction fees and high throughput. These factors attract a mix of legitimate users and malicious actors seeking opportunities to exploit vulnerabilities. High Activity and Liquidity BSC processes a vast number of transactions daily, making it a lucrative target for attackers. High liquidity ensures attackers can profit significantly from even small manipulations. Mempool Visibility The mempool in public blockchains like BSC is transparent, allowing attackers to monitor pending transactions and exploit them in real-time. The Scale of the Damage Impact on Users Victims of sandwich attacks often experience unexpected slippage , leading to unfavorable trade execution prices. This undermines trust in the platform and can result in financial losses. Ecosystem Trust Frequent and large-scale attacks such as this erode confidence in the BSC ecosystem , potentially deterring new users and projects from adopting the platform. Industry Reactions The crypto community has expressed concerns over the increasing frequency of such attacks. Security experts and developers are urging blockchain platforms to implement anti-front-running measures to safeguard users. Community Feedback “This level of exploitation shows that DeFi still has a long way to go in terms of security.” “Transparent mempools are both a strength and a vulnerability. We need solutions like private transactions to counter these attacks.” How Sandwich Attacks Can Be Mitigated Transaction Privacy Tools Platforms can integrate privacy tools such as zero-knowledge proofs or encrypted mempools to prevent attackers from monitoring pending transactions. Slippage Protection DeFi platforms could implement mechanisms to alert users if their transactions are vulnerable to slippage or exploitation. Educational Initiatives Educating users about setting appropriate slippage limits and recognizing potential threats is key to reducing individual exposure to attacks. A Broader Issue in DeFi The sandwich attacks on BSC are not an isolated case. DeFi platforms across various blockchains have faced similar vulnerabilities. The open and permissionless nature of these systems, while revolutionary, also makes them susceptible to exploitation. Other Recent Exploits Ethereum and Polygon have also reported sandwich attacks, albeit on a smaller scale compared to BSC’s December 1 incident. Flash loan attacks remain another persistent issue in the DeFi space. Binance’s Silence: A Missed Opportunity? As the entity behind BSC, Binance plays a crucial role in maintaining user trust. However, the absence of a public statement addressing the attacks has left users questioning the platform’s commitment to security. What Users Expect Transparency: Clear communication about the scale of the issue and steps being taken to mitigate future risks. Action Plans: A roadmap for improving blockchain security and protecting user funds. Conclusion: Lessons from the BSC Sandwich Attacks The revelation that 35.5% of BSC blocks were impacted by sandwich attacks underscores the pressing need for enhanced security measures in DeFi ecosystems. While BSC’s popularity attracts attackers, it also highlights the challenges of balancing transparency with security in blockchain technology. For BSC and other DeFi platforms to thrive, addressing vulnerabilities and rebuilding user trust is paramount. Proactive steps such as improving transaction privacy and slippage protection can pave the way for a safer decentralized future.

37203613,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=106838,1733304152,"Spot Solana ETF Launch Under Trump’s SEC Is “A Matter of When, Not If,” Says Bloomberg Analyst","Spot Solana ETF Launch Anticipated Under Trump’s SEC Nominee The launch of a spot Solana ETF may soon become a reality, according to James Seyffart , a Bloomberg ETF analyst. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Seyffart stated that the approval of such ETFs is now “a matter of when—not if,” particularly under the anticipated leadership of Paul Atkins , President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman . While the analyst’s prediction has generated excitement in the cryptocurrency community, Seyffart cautioned that approval might still take time despite Atkins’ known crypto-friendly stance . Who Is Paul Atkins, and Why Does It Matter? Trump’s SEC Nominee and His Stance on Crypto Paul Atkins, a former SEC Commissioner with a reputation for advocating lighter regulatory oversight, is expected to spearhead a more crypto-friendly agenda at the SEC. His nomination aligns with the Trump administration’s broader focus on fostering financial innovation and reducing regulatory hurdles. Implications for Crypto ETFs Atkins’ appointment could signal a shift in how the SEC approaches spot cryptocurrency ETFs , including those tied to Solana (SOL) . The previous SEC leadership faced criticism for delaying or rejecting applications for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. A more favorable regulatory environment might pave the way for approvals across various cryptocurrencies. Why Solana? Solana’s Growing Popularity Solana has emerged as a leading blockchain platform due to its: High Scalability: The network can handle thousands of transactions per second. Low Fees: Transaction costs on Solana are significantly lower compared to Ethereum. Expanding Ecosystem: A vibrant community of decentralized applications (dApps) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has bolstered Solana’s appeal. Investor Interest As institutional interest in cryptocurrencies grows, Solana-based ETFs offer an opportunity to gain exposure to one of the market’s fastest-growing assets. A spot ETF would allow investors to directly invest in Solana without the complexities of wallet management or direct token purchases. Spot ETFs vs. Futures ETFs: Why Spot Matters A spot ETF tracks the actual price of an asset by holding the underlying tokens, unlike futures ETFs, which derive their value from contracts tied to future prices. Advantages of Spot ETFs Lower Costs: Avoids the rolling fees associated with futures contracts. Greater Price Accuracy: Reflects the real-time value of the asset. Enhanced Adoption: Simplifies crypto investing for retail and institutional investors alike. Challenges in Approval Despite these benefits, the SEC has previously raised concerns about market manipulation and a lack of robust surveillance mechanisms in the spot cryptocurrency market. What Bloomberg’s Analyst Predicts Seyffart’s Outlook James Seyffart believes the shift in SEC leadership under Trump’s administration increases the likelihood of spot crypto ETF approvals, including for Solana. However, he tempered expectations by noting that bureaucratic processes and ongoing market concerns might delay immediate action. Timing Uncertain While the sentiment around Solana ETFs is positive, Seyffart emphasized that “a favorable chair doesn’t mean fast approvals,” suggesting that investors might need to wait for broader regulatory clarity. Community Reactions Optimism Among Crypto Advocates The crypto community has expressed enthusiasm about the possibility of a spot Solana ETF , viewing it as a milestone for mainstream adoption. “This could be a game-changer for Solana and the entire crypto market.” “With Paul Atkins at the helm, we’re finally moving in the right direction.” Skepticism Lingers Others remain cautious, pointing to the SEC’s historically slow pace in approving cryptocurrency-related products. “I’ll believe it when I see it. The SEC isn’t known for quick decisions.” “Even with Atkins, the road ahead won’t be easy.” Potential Impact on the Crypto Market The approval of a spot Solana ETF could have far-reaching implications: 1. Increased Institutional Participation A spot ETF would lower barriers for institutional investors, driving liquidity and legitimacy for Solana and other cryptocurrencies. 2. Boost to Solana’s Price Historically, ETF launches have positively influenced the underlying asset’s price. Solana could experience significant upward momentum if a spot ETF is approved. 3. Broader Crypto Adoption Spot ETFs make cryptocurrencies more accessible, encouraging adoption by mainstream investors unfamiliar with traditional crypto trading. Challenges Ahead While optimism is high, hurdles remain: Regulatory Uncertainty: The SEC’s stance on market manipulation must evolve to accommodate spot crypto ETFs. Market Infrastructure: Exchanges and custodians need to enhance transparency and security measures. Public Perception: Skepticism around crypto’s volatility and environmental impact persists. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto ETFs? The potential approval of a spot Solana ETF under Trump’s SEC appointee Paul Atkins represents a significant turning point for cryptocurrency markets. While challenges remain, the shift in regulatory leadership offers hope for a more favorable environment for digital asset investment products. If realized, a spot Solana ETF could boost institutional adoption, elevate Solana’s market profile, and set the stage for further innovation in crypto investing.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has proposed new licensing requirements that would make it harder for crypto businesses to avoid regulation. But with these stricter rules, some are worried that many startups might be forced to leave. Is innovation at risk? New Licensing Rules for Crypto Firms: What’s Changing? According to the proposed consultation paper , most crypto exchanges and businesses dealing with digital assets will need to obtain financial licenses. This includes acquiring an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL) and, in some cases, an Australian Market License. We have released a consultation paper outlining proposals to update our digital asset guidance: https://t.co/PR6k2KDgY7 pic.twitter.com/a3tuRbxOVR — ASIC Media (@asicmedia) December 3, 2024 The new rules also expand the classification of financial products to include stablecoins, staking services, exchange tokens, and wrapped tokens. However, Bitcoin, Ethereum, memecoins, and gaming-related NFTs might not be affected by these changes, providing some relief for the industry. Consumers Come First ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland stated that the aim is to find a balance between fostering innovation and protecting consumers. The regulator is encouraging all stakeholders to participate in the consultation process, which will close on February 28, 2025. Although the guidelines present challenges, some leaders in the crypto industry view them as a step in the right direction. Swyftx CEO and ASX Company director Jason Titman noted that clearer regulations could increase market confidence, though he pointed out that Australia’s approach is more detailed and strict than other countries. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinbase Declares War; Bans Firms Hiring Anti-Crypto Lawyers , What’s at Stake: Will Australia Lead or Fall Behind? The final guidelines, expected by mid-2025, will determine whether Australia becomes a global leader in regulated crypto markets or risks losing its position as an innovative hub. The Impact on Startups The stricter regulations are raising concerns, especially for smaller crypto businesses. ASIC’s requirements, such as maintaining large reserves, could be financially overwhelming for startups. Charlie Karaboga, CEO of Block Earner, emphasized that while regulatory clarity is beneficial, the added financial pressure could force many small businesses to move their operations abroad. “This clarity is helpful but places immense financial strain on small businesses like ours,” Karaboga remarked. Legal experts warn that high compliance costs could discourage new entrants to the market, potentially making Australia less competitive on the global stage. Joni Pirovich , a crypto lawyer, cautioned that if the country doesn’t offer more flexibility, we could see a wave of crypto companies leaving for more favorable locations.

37203537,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=106840,1733304040,"Altcoin Season Index Rises to 88, Signaling Market Shift in December 2024","Altcoin Season Index Hits 88: What It Means for Crypto Traders The Altcoin Season Index climbed two points to 88 as of 00:30 UTC on December 4, 2024, according to cryptocurrency data platform CoinMarketCap (CMC) . This marks another strong indication that the crypto market is firmly in Altcoin Season , a period characterized by altcoins outperforming Bitcoin. This metric, widely used by traders and analysts, tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) over the past 90 days. An index score above 75 confirms Altcoin Season, while scores below 25 signify Bitcoin Season. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index How the Index Works The Altcoin Season Index assesses whether altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) are outperforming Bitcoin over a rolling 90-day period. Altcoin Season Threshold: At least 75% of the top 100 coins must have outperformed Bitcoin. Bitcoin Season Threshold: If only 25% or fewer coins outperform Bitcoin, the market is in Bitcoin Season. Score Range: The index ranges from 1 to 100 , updated daily based on price data from CMC. Current Score: 88 With a score of 88, the market is in a strong Altcoin Season, reflecting significant momentum for altcoins against Bitcoin. Key Drivers Behind the Altcoin Surge 1. Market Diversification Investors are diversifying portfolios as confidence in established altcoins grows. Projects with strong fundamentals like Ethereum (ETH) , Solana (SOL) , and Polygon (MATIC) are drawing significant interest. 2. DeFi and NFT Growth The growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has bolstered demand for altcoins, many of which underpin these ecosystems. 3. Bitcoin’s Relative Stability Bitcoin’s performance over the past 90 days has been steady but less volatile, allowing altcoins to seize the spotlight. What Does an Index of 88 Mean for Traders? Opportunities for Altcoin Holders An index score of 88 signals that altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin, providing lucrative opportunities for those invested in projects with strong momentum. Heightened Volatility Altcoin Season is often accompanied by increased market volatility, offering both risks and rewards for active traders. Shift in Market Sentiment The high Altcoin Season Index reflects growing confidence in altcoins, suggesting traders see them as valuable assets in their own right rather than mere alternatives to Bitcoin. How Is the Index Calculated? Exclusions Stablecoins (e.g., USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (e.g., WBTC) are excluded from calculations to focus on native altcoins. Data Sources The metric pulls data from CoinMarketCap , comparing price performance across the top 100 cryptocurrencies .

Market Sentiment: Dominated by Bitcoin; reflects consolidation and a focus on stability. Community Reactions and Insights Crypto Analyst Perspectives Bullish on Altcoins: Many analysts are optimistic about sustained growth in altcoins, pointing to strong fundamentals and increasing adoption. Caution Amid Volatility: Others warn traders to be cautious, as Altcoin Season often leads to speculative bubbles. Trader Sentiments on Social Media “This is the time to focus on quality projects like SOL and MATIC.” “Altcoin Season is exciting, but don’t forget to take profits!” What’s Next for the Crypto Market? Potential Continuation of Altcoin Season The index score of 88 suggests a robust Altcoin Season, but traders should watch for potential reversals if Bitcoin gains momentum. Institutional Interest in Altcoins Institutional investors are increasingly exploring altcoins, drawn by their diverse use cases in DeFi , NFTs , and layer-2 scaling solutions . Regulatory Developments Upcoming regulatory decisions could impact altcoin performance, particularly for projects operating in jurisdictions with uncertain crypto policies. Conclusion: Riding the Wave of Altcoin Season The rise of the Altcoin Season Index to 88 highlights the growing dominance of altcoins in the cryptocurrency market. For traders and investors, this signals opportunities to capitalize on the momentum of high-performing projects. However, as with any market trend, caution and research are essential.

Conversely, periods of “Extreme Fear” have historically signaled buying opportunities, as seen during market dips in 2022. How Traders Use the Fear & Greed Index As a Sentiment Indicator The index provides insight into market psychology, helping traders gauge whether the market is overbought or oversold. Risk Management Tool By identifying extremes in sentiment, traders can adjust their strategies to mitigate risk during euphoric or pessimistic phases. Community Reactions to the Latest Score Optimism in Social Media Circles “78 on the index! Bull run confirmed?” “Extreme Greed is here, but remember to take profits.” Cautious Voices “Markets look good, but these scores often precede corrections.” “Fear & Greed Index is useful, but don’t rely on it solely.” What’s Next for the Crypto Market? Key Indicators to Watch Volatility: Increased price swings could shift the index lower into the “Greed” or “Neutral” zones. Trading Volumes: Sustained growth in volume may reinforce bullish momentum. Bitcoin Price: As the market leader, Bitcoin’s performance will heavily influence overall sentiment. Potential Scenarios Sustained Bullish Momentum: If optimism persists, the market could see further price increases.

37203503,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=107104,1733303930,Why You Can’t Miss Tokyo TEAMZ Summit 2025 During the Global Web3 Bull Market,"Tokyo is undoubtedly one of the most beloved cities for Web3 professionals. It’s a place that satisfies all your desires—whether for work or leisure. Imagine attending a business conference in a city that also offers ample opportunities for enjoyment outside work—it’s an ideal scenario. And Tokyo is precisely that kind of city. TEAMZ Summit is strategically held in April, a time when Japan enjoys its best weather of the year. The pleasant climate and the breathtaking cherry blossoms create a picturesque “pink Tokyo.” Whether you’re attending with colleagues to make things happen or bringing family and friends for a combined conference and sightseeing trip, this is an excellent plan. From a business perspective, April is significant in Japan as it marks the first month after governmental and corporate personnel shifts, making it the true start of Q1 for Japanese businesses. This is the time when government policies, annual business plans, and strategic decisions for the year are typically announced. At TEAMZ Summit 2025, attendees will gain insights into the latest developments in Japan’s Web3 industry, including national Web3 strategies, financial regulatory policies, tax incentives, and the latest updates from major corporations and communities. Moreover, Expo 2025 Osaka, an international event with the theme “Designing Future Society for Our Lives,” will open on April 13, 2025. Focused on innovation and collaboration for global sustainability, Expo 2025 offers an additional incentive for you to visit Japan, allowing you to experience both TEAMZ Summit and the Expo during the same trip. If these reasons still don’t convince you to attend, let’s delve into the Japanese Web3 market landscape and the highlights of TEAMZ Summit 2025 to give you a clear picture of what awaits. Japan’s Web3 Market Landscape On the National Level Web3 is now a crucial component of Japan’s national strategy, identified as a key driver of economic growth. To support the healthy development of the cryptocurrency industry, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) and Digital Agency are actively advancing regulations and reforming tax policies. Reforms in Cryptocurrency Tax Policies: 1. Exemption on Unrealized Profits: As of April 2024, businesses holding cryptocurrencies are no longer taxed on unrealized profits. Previously, companies were required to pay taxes on the market value of their holdings at the fiscal year-end. The new policy only taxes profits from actual sales of cryptocurrencies. 2. Proposed Tax Rate Adjustment: Currently, income from cryptocurrency trading is classified as “miscellaneous income” and subject to progressive tax rates as high as 55%. Proposals have been made to unify cryptocurrency tax rates at 20% to boost market competitiveness. Compliance Policies for Cryptocurrencies: 1. Registration Requirements: Under the Payment Services Act, businesses offering cryptocurrency exchange services must register with the FSA as cryptocurrency exchange service providers. Services include buying, selling, or exchanging different cryptocurrencies. 2. Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs): Organizations like the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) and Japan Security Token Offering Association (JSTOA) establish and oversee operational rules and internal controls for exchanges to ensure compliance. 3. Anti-Money Laundering (AML): Cryptocurrency service providers must comply with the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds, conducting due diligence to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing risks. 4. Web3 VC Licenses: In February 2024, Japan approved a proposal allowing venture capital (VC) firms to directly invest in cryptocurrencies and Web3 projects. This proposal integrates cryptocurrencies into local Limited Partnership (LPS) structures, reducing barriers for Web3 companies to raise funds. Through these reforms, Japan is creating a more favorable environment for cryptocurrency innovation and growth within the Web3 sector. Corporate Adoption of Blockchain Technology Many major Japanese corporations are integrating blockchain into their existing businesses, utilizing tokens to enhance user experiences. Notable examples include: – SBI Holdings: – Partnered with TradeFinex to develop blockchain-based trade finance tools. – Collaborated with UBS and DBS to execute the world’s first cross-border repo transaction involving native digital bonds. – NTT Docomo: – Established NTT Digital to promote Web3 applications for individuals and businesses. – Partnered with Amazon to develop tokenized asset solutions. – Toppan Printing: – Developed blockchain-based supply chain management tools. – Collaborated with NICT to research secure communication technologies resistant to quantum computing. – NEC (Japan Electric Corporation): – Conducted trials of quantum tokens, combining quantum technology with blockchain. – Leveraged blockchain to improve KYC processes for financial institutions. Web3 Startups and Projects Japan’s Web3 startup ecosystem is steadily expanding, with the country’s rich cultural and intellectual property (IP) resources serving as a unique advantage. Using these assets, Japanese Web3 startups have launched globally acclaimed games, NFTs, and other projects. Hundreds of active local Web3 projects are thriving, and their numbers are growing. Regulated Cryptocurrency Exchanges Japan’s regulatory framework ensures transparency and compliance for cryptocurrency exchanges. Currently, 32 licensed exchanges operate under FSA oversight, including: – bitFlyer: Japan’s largest crypto platform, offering spot and margin trading. – Coincheck: A popular platform for cryptocurrency trading and NFT markets. – SBI VC Trade: Focused on institutional investors. – Bitbank: Known for its high liquidity and wide range of trading pairs. With a monthly spot trading volume of approximately ¥900 billion ($6 billion), Japan is a key player in the global cryptocurrency market. Highlights of TEAMZ Summit 2025 As Japan’s premier Web3 summit, TEAMZ Summit has become a vital platform for connecting industry resources, sharing insights, and showcasing innovation. Here’s what makes the 7th annual summit in 2025 stand out: 1.

High-Quality Exhibition Projects – 100 top-tier exhibitors, spanning Layer1/Layer2, wallets, RWA, DePin, NFTs, Web3 Dapps, and service providers, will showcase the latest technological innovations and practical applications. 3. Extensive Industry Support – 100 leading VC firms providing funding opportunities. – 100 community partners supporting ecosystem growth. – 100 media partners ensuring maximum exposure. – 500 global KOLs amplifying summit impact. – 100 side events, including private meetings, salons, and gala dinners, to enrich the attendee experience. 4.

37203498,https://thecoinrise.com/grayscale-joins-the-race-for-spot-solana-etf-with-sec-filing/,1733303758,Grayscale Joins the Race for Spot Solana ETF with SEC Filing,"Grayscale Investments has taken another step toward solidifying its presence in the cryptocurrency ETF space. On December 3, the digital asset management firm filed a 19b-4 form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert its existing Grayscale Solana Trust into a spot Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF). If approved, the ETF, trading under the ticker GSOL, would list on the New York Stock Exchange, offering investors direct exposure to Solana (SOL) through traditional markets. The Grayscale Solana Trust currently holds $134.2 million in assets under management, making it the largest Solana investment fund globally. Notably, the trust’s holdings represent approximately 0.1% of the total circulating supply of Solana. Coinbase Custody has been named as the proposed custodian for the ETF, while BNY Mellon’s asset servicing division will serve as its administrator and transfer agent. Rising Competition in the Solana ETF Space Grayscale isn’t the only player vying for the SEC’s approval of a spot Solana ETF. The firm faces stiff competition from rivals such as 21Shares, VanEck, Canary Capital, and Bitwise, all of whom have submitted similar applications. Even investment giant Franklin Templeton has expressed interest in launching a spot Solana ETF. The growing interest in Solana ETFs can be attributed to the cryptocurrency’s remarkable performance over the past year. Solana’s price has surged by an impressive 277%, pushing its market capitalization beyond $112 billion. Following Grayscale’s filing, Solana’s price rose nearly 4% to $238, reflecting heightened market enthusiasm. To proceed with the ETF listing, Grayscale will need the SEC to approve its 19b-4 filing, which involves a proposed rule change by a self-regulatory organization, such as a stock exchange. Additionally, the firm must submit an S-1 registration statement, allowing GSOL to be listed on a public exchange. Broader Implications for the Crypto Market This move highlights the increasing mainstream interest in cryptocurrency investment products. A successful approval could further legitimize Solana as a prominent blockchain network and pave the way for other digital assets to enter traditional financial markets. Grayscale’s filing follows its recent success in converting its spot Bitcoin and Ether trusts into ETFs, signaling its commitment to broadening access to digital asset investments. As the competition heats up, the SEC’s decision on these ETFs will likely shape the future of institutional crypto adoption in the U.S. The post Grayscale Joins the Race for Spot Solana ETF with SEC Filing appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",POSITIVE,SOL,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | SOL,,0,0,The Coin Rise,https://thecoinrise.com/grayscale-joins-the-race-for-spot-solana-etf-with-sec-filing/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/37203498.jpeg

This move aligns with a growing trend of applications for altcoin ETFs, including recent filings for XRP -focused products by firms like WisdomTree, VanEck, and 21Shares. Grayscale’s Solana ETF aims to provide institutional investors a safer, regulated way to invest in Solana ( SOL ) through a spot ETF listed on a national exchange. If approved, Solana would become the third cryptocurrency with institutional investment opportunities in the U.S., following Bitcoin and Ethereum. Solana's price has already reacted to the news, jumping nearly 5% in one day. Grayscale is not alone in pursuing Solana ETFs. At least four other asset management firms, including VanEck, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Canary Capital, have filed similar applications with the SEC in November. This increasing interest reflects growing institutional enthusiasm for altcoins as Bitcoin's dominance in the market declines. The SEC has reportedly engaged in quiet negotiations over these filings, signaling potential progress. Approval of a Solana ETF would mark a major milestone for regulatory acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. Such a move could pave the way for further institutional investments and likely fuel a bullish trend in the altcoin market. Analysts predict a broader ""altcoin season,"" with renewed interest in other cryptocurrencies like XRP. WisdomTree’s XRP ETF filing has also garnered attention, with Coinbase named as the custodian for the fund. The potential impact of these ETFs extends beyond individual cryptocurrencies. Experts suggest that regulatory approval could significantly boost the entire crypto market, similar to the effects seen when Bitcoin ETFs gained approval. If institutional demand follows suit, these products could drive substantial market growth. The crypto industry is also optimistic about changes in U.S. regulatory policies. Reports suggest that Donald Trump, in his second term, may appoint a pro-crypto SEC Chair, potentially creating a friendlier environment for cryptocurrency regulations. This shift could lead to multiple ETF approvals in the near future, intensifying momentum in the altcoin market. While the SEC’s decisions remain pending, anticipation continues to grow. If these ETFs gain approval, they could trigger significant institutional investment inflows, boosting confidence and interest in the broader cryptocurrency market.",POSITIVE,SOL | XRP,ALTCOIN | MARKET | REGULATION | SOL | XRP,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/sec-weighs-solana-and-xrp-etfs:-altcoin-boom-ahead-,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37203444.jpeg

37203497,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622372,1733303604,"Wall Street’s December opens cold, but a thaw may be around the corner","Wall Street opened December with a shiver, not a bang. The S&P 500 stayed flat, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.17%, and the Nasdaq Composite eked out a 0.4% gain. Apple carried the Nasdaq to that slim victory, climbing 1.3% to hit a new 52-week high. A cold open for stocks isn’t unusual, but December is no ordinary month for the market. Historically, it ranks as the third-best month of the year for stocks, according to the Stock Trader’s Almanac . In presidential election years, it punches up to second place. The shaky beginning could be linked to tax loss selling. Investors unloading losing assets to offset capital gains is a familiar year-end dance. Bob Pisani of CNBC pointed out that this can drag markets down early in December. But this slump rarely lasts long. The back half of the month often sees a rally. Fed rate drama looms large Investors are laser-focused on Friday’s release of November’s jobs report. This will be the Federal Reserve’s last major data point before its December 17–18 rate-setting meeting. According to the CME FedWatch tool , there’s now a 72.9% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut. That’s a significant jump from last week’s 59.4%. The Fed has already slashed rates twice this year—a big 50-basis-point cut in September and another 25 in November. Yet not everyone is convinced more cuts are coming. CNBC’s Jimmy Cramer has flagged concerns about market complacency. “The market might be getting too aggressive with its expectations for rate cuts,” he warned. Jim pointed to recent rises in inflation metrics like the consumer price index and personal consumption expenditures index. These suggest the economy may not be as fragile as some think, potentially giving the Fed less room to maneuver. If the central bank does decide to trim rates again, the move could thaw Wall Street’s chill. A rate cut might give stocks the push they need to end the year on a high note. Adding to global market drama, South Korea faced a bout of political turmoil this week. President Yoon Suk Yeol lifted emergency martial law on Wednesday after the National Assembly overturned his decree. Yoon had declared the measures during a heated budget clash with opposition lawmakers. The fallout hit South Korea’s markets hard. The Kospi tumbled over 2%, and the won plummeted to a two-year low against the U.S. dollar before staging a partial recovery. South Korean stocks listed in the U.S. also took a hit before regaining some ground, and the infamous kimchi premium came to life in crypto markets. AI mania and market risks Now this year’s Wall Street rally has been turbocharged by AI stocks. Nvidia, the poster child of this trend, has soared over 180%. The company’s explosive growth alone accounts for about a fifth of the S&P 500’s gains this year. But not everyone is buying it. Joe Davis, chief economist at Vanguard , thinks investors may be overestimating AI’s immediate potential, and that the stock market is overheated. “The U.S. stock market today is pricing roughly a 90% probability for AI’s impact,” Davis said. “We see that at closer to 60–65%.” He compared the current AI-driven rally to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. Back then, soaring valuations eventually led to a massive crash. “From an economic perspective, we’re in 1992. From a valuation perspective, we’re in 1997,” Davis said, pointing to the mismatch between long-term potential and short-term expectations.

37204009,https://invezz.com/?p=2352973,1733302947,"South Korea’s martial law sparks record-breaking crypto trading surge, reaching $34B in volume","The implementation of South Korea’s martial law has unexpectedly driven the country’s cryptocurrency market to new heights, with trading volumes reaching a record-breaking $34.2 billion in the last 24-hour period. This dramatic surge in trading activity underscores how geopolitical events can trigger significant market movements, particularly within the volatile crypto space. The heightened trading volume was observed across South Korea’s five major crypto exchanges, which included Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax. This development reflects a growing trend where political unrest impacts financial markets, often leading to panic selling and increased trading volume as investors seek to move assets quickly. The spike in trading volume came on the heels of South Korea’s decision to implement martial law on December 3, 2024. Following the emergency curfew and restrictions imposed by the government, the crypto markets in the country saw a massive influx of activity. According to CoinMarketCap , South Korea’s combined crypto spot trading volume surged nearly 50% in just a day, significantly surpassing the previous record of $18 billion set just a day earlier. This marked an extraordinary contrast to stock market volumes, which were outpaced by 22%. The surge in trading activity was primarily attributed to the political instability surrounding President Yoon Suk-yeol’s sudden imposition of martial law. The decree, which lasted only six hours, was enacted under the pretext of protecting South Korea from “North Korea’s communist forces” and eliminating perceived “anti-state elements.” However, the law’s abrupt implementation triggered widespread protests and unrest. In response to the political chaos, South Korean citizens rushed to sell their cryptocurrencies, which led to a sharp decline in digital asset prices. The prices of major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum fell to their lowest levels in months, with Bitcoin dropping to around 88 million won and Ethereum to 4.2 million won. Some exchanges experienced site outages due to the overwhelming trading activity. The surge in trading was also reflected in the market dominance of Upbit, South Korea’s largest exchange, which accounted for more than $27.25 billion in spot trading volume alone. The ripple effect of martial law on crypto prices As the political unrest unfolded, many South Korean traders, fearing further instability, chose to liquidate their crypto holdings. This panic sell-off was not unlike previous market reactions seen during other major geopolitical events, such as the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. The sudden sell-off sent shockwaves through the market, with altcoins like Ripple (XRP), Stellar Lumens (XLM), and Solana experiencing double-digit declines in price. The political turmoil surrounding the martial law decision also created ripple effects in the broader financial market. Crypto investors in South Korea, concerned about the potential for more disruptions, reacted by moving quickly to secure their assets. As the crisis developed, the country saw an increase in trading volume as local exchanges processed a flood of sell orders. BoK pledges short-term liquidity boost to stabilize FX market In response to South Korea’s recent political upheaval, the Bank of Korea (BOK) announced on Wednesday its commitment to boost short-term liquidity and stabilize foreign exchange (FX) markets as necessary. The Bank of Korea convened an emergency board meeting early Wednesday to assess the financial impact of the turmoil. Following the meeting, the central bank released a statement pledging to inject funds into the market through special loans if required. “As announced together with the government, we will provide sufficient liquidity for a limited time until the financial and foreign exchange markets stabilize,” the BOK stated. Local reports from Yonhap News revealed that the country’s financial regulator is prepared to deploy 10 trillion won ($7.07 billion) into a stock market stabilization fund if necessary.

Key Levels to Watch for the Breakout appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP is currently in a consolidation phase, trading around $2.6 after failing to break through the key $3 resistance level. Recently, the cryptocurrency surged to $2.9 but stumbled at $3, causing a 7.91% drop. It has since settled into a narrow range between $2.4 and $2.6, leaving traders wondering if XRP can finally push past the $3 barrier or if more consolidation is on the way. Keep reading to find out where XRP’s price could head in the days ahead. The Battle at $3 Market analyst Dom highlights that XRP’s struggle to pass the $3 mark is due to significant sell orders on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Binance has 34 million XRP in sell orders between $2.8 and $3.5, while Coinbase adds 16 million XRP. Together, these sell walls total 50 million XRP, creating a major hurdle for XRP to climb higher. $XRP orderbook update My last update I identified major sell walls on Binance spot Those are still here, and have also increased to around 34M XRP to $3.50 Coinbase spot has around 16M XRP sell walls to $3.50 I would be lying if I didn't say this is going to take some… https://t.co/zFFhdXdjH1 pic.twitter.com/wBW3hKpc13 — Dom (@traderview2) December 3, 2024 This suggests strong resistance around $3, making it tough to break without a surge in demand. Political Tensions in South Korea The recent political situation in South Korea, where martial law has halted trading activity, is also affecting XRP. However, experts believe that once geopolitical tensions ease, XRP may regain its momentum, boosting optimism for its price in the near future. Can XRP Hold Its Ground? On the other hand, there is solid support at lower price levels. Binance has 10 million XRP in buy walls between $1.9 and $2.3, while Coinbase has 4.3 million XRP in the same range. Together, these buy walls total 14.3 million XRP, showing strong demand at these levels and suggesting that downside risk might be limited in the short term. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ethereum Price Prediction (Dec 4th 2024) , Is a Rally on the Horizon? Experts Weigh In Dom believes that XRP’s current consolidation between $2.4 and $2.6 could set the stage for a future rally, as long as it remains stable within this range. However, breaking past $3 will require strong buying momentum and increased market activity. Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher praised XRP’s 10-year chart, calling it one of the strongest in crypto, marked by dramatic spikes, steep falls, and long periods of dormancy. He hopes this rally will resemble the success of 2021, not the decline of 2018. The 10-year $XRP chart is one of the weirdest charts in crypto.

FAQs How high will XRP go in 2025? Analysts suggest that XRP could reach $5-$10 in 2025 if adoption and market conditions remain favorable. Will XRP reach $10 dollars? XRP could hit $10, but it depends on mass adoption, legal outcomes, and broader crypto market trends supporting its growth. Is XRP going to skyrocket?

37202838,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622375,1733302407,"Binance Coin (BNB) breaks to new ATH, boosted by general altcoin trend","Binance Coin (BNB) finally broke out, a day after the former CEO of Binance Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao announced the official altcoin season. The asset reached a new all-time high, following the trend of other old altcoins. Binance Coin (BNB) rallied to a new all-time high of $772.97, before sliding back to the $760 range. Previously, BNB peaked at $707.02 during the H1 bull rally. Binance Coin (BNB) expanded to a new all-time high. | Source: Coinmarketcap Trading volumes expanded near their peak range for 2024, at above $5.49B. The current rally only traded around 5% of the supply of BNB. With a total supply of 144M tokens, BNB is seen as a potential rival to Ethereum (ETH). Open interest expanded to a three-year high of $1.29B, bringing BNB to the forefront for active traders. Until recently, BNB behaved as a utility token, remaining relatively stagnant similar to Ethereum (ETH). BNB is an internationally available and widely traded asset. The most recent ATH rally, however, took its energy from the Chinese market, along with the new all-time high for TRON (TRX) above $0.40. The next step for BNB would be to continue with new highs, while targeting a four-digit valuation. However, the recent price rally led to an immediate shift to long positions , increasing their share to 75%. Attacks against those positions may cut the rally short and lead to a drawdown. BNB was one of the assets to lag behind the rest of the market, spending years in accumulation during the bear market. BNB did not immediately reflect the primacy of Binance as the main CEX during the 2024 bull cycle. The recent rally is a delayed reaction to many months of expectation for a breakout to a new high. Binance’s native asset is offering 3.65% in annualized returns for staking. BNB is also needed for almost all activities and special projects on Binance, encouraging long-term holding. BNB felt the pressure of regulations, as Binance reinvented its approach to multiple centralized and decentralized assets. Over the course of the bear market, Binance phased out BUSD, while increasing the role of the more regulated USDC. The release of ‘CZ’ Zhao from his four-month sentence was one of the triggers that led to renewed demand for Binance’s services. The Bitcoin (BTC) rally to an all-time high also put Binance near the top as the leading global market, tapping EU and Asian demand. All of those factors combined led to the recent breakout. BNB gets a boost from CEX trading volumes Despite all the talk of Web3 and decentralized activity, when it came to the biggest pumps and trading volumes, centralized exchanges were still the main venue. Binance led all other exchanges with inflows since January 2024. Binance’s ecosystem was one of the leaders in the attempts to popularize Web3, gaming, and NFTs. However, those trends proved volatile and the liquidity of centralized trading pairs was unmatched. Binance has always been the venue of pumping coins, where one active trading pair provides the main activity, leading the price discovery. Decentralized trading on BNB Smart Chain remains active, but has seen the impact of bot-driven sandwich attacks . Decentralized exchanges are still an important part of the Binance ecosystem, with a growing share of overall trading, but centralized pairs led the recent altcoin rally. DEXs currently take up around 27% of reported CEX volumes, though with some distrust due to bots and sandwiching exploits. Instead of branching out into DEXs, Binance has left PancakeSwap to thrive on its own. The exchange continues to rebuild its list of assets, recently adding a streak of meme tokens based on their liquidity and community potential. The presence of a Binance spot pair radically changes the trading profile of those assets, while driving more users to the exchange. As a result, in November, Binance broke above 240M registered users , while claiming its goal was to onboard the first 1B people into crypto. Binance still carries more than $157B in reported assets on its wallets, far outstripping other exchanges as a holder of old and new coins. The exchange has also committed to sharing its transparent funds for additional reassurance. Binance’s decentralized ecosystem is much smaller, carrying only $5.89B in value locked.

37202901,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51315,1733301579,Top Developer Tutors Critic Who Claims XRP Is Misleading Investors,"In a recent conversation on Twitter, Panos Mekras, co-founder of Anodos Finance, addressed allegations made by Justin Bons, Founder and CIO of CyberCapital, concerning Ripple, XRP, and the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Bons accused Ripple and XRP of promoting misleading claims about decentralization, asserting that Ripple maintains total control over the network and describing these claims as fraudulent. Mekras countered with a detailed rebuttal, emphasizing the decentralized nature of XRPL and correcting misconceptions about its governance. The Core of Bons’s Criticism Justin Bons asserted that Ripple’s influence over XRP centralizes and controls the XRP Ledger. He further claimed that the foundation associated with XRP misleads retail investors by making false decentralization claims. Bons’s remarks drew criticism from XRP proponents, including Mekras, who dismissed these allegations as baseless and disinformation. The disinformation against $XRP continues. It's as if haters coordinate together. Let's clear this up once and for all: Is the XRP Ledger centralized or decentralized? One of the biggest misconceptions is that the XRP network is centralized and that Ripple or the foundation… https://t.co/79WK9JnwaT — Panos {X} (@panosmek) December 2, 2024 Mekras’ Response Panos Mekras offered a comprehensive response , outlining the technical and structural elements of XRPL to debunk Bons’ claims. He highlighted key points about the XRPL’s architecture and consensus mechanism: Decentralized Consensus Protocol : XRPL operates on a consensus protocol rooted in the Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA). Validators, which play a critical role in the network, validate and record transactions without receiving incentives. This design promotes impartiality and prevents conflicts of interest. Mekras contrasted this with Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work system, where miners are financially incentivized to validate blocks, potentially introducing centralization through mining pools. Global Distribution of Nodes : Mekras noted that the XRP Ledger has over 100 active validators and 700 nodes worldwide. These nodes are managed by diverse entities, including developers, institutions, universities, and community members. Ripple operates only a single validator within the default Unique Node List (UNL), representing less than 3% of the network’s validators. This distribution prevents Ripple from exerting unilateral control over the ledger. Consensus Rules and Decision-Making : To achieve consensus on the XRP Ledger, at least 80% of validators must agree on transactions and proposed changes. Mekras emphasized that this system contrasts with Bitcoin’s model, where miners unilaterally determine which transactions are included in a block. On XRPL, deterministic rules ensure fair processing and approval of transactions without the possibility of favoritism. Open Access to Participation : Anyone can set up and operate a validator or stock node on the XRP Ledger. Mekras encouraged skeptics to review the ledger’s infrastructure through publicly available documentation. He clarified that the UNL is merely a list of trusted validators that participants can adopt or customize. Most nodes currently use the UNL curated by the XRP Ledger Foundation, an independent entity separate from Ripple. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Addressing Allegations of Centralization Mekras refuted the notion that Ripple or the XRP Foundation controls XRPL. He explained that XRPL’s decentralization stems from its open-source nature and diverse validator participation. The network’s governance relies on broad consensus rather than the influence of a single entity. The developer also emphasized that XRPL’s architecture offers a more decentralized framework compared to many other blockchain networks, including Bitcoin. Mekras’s detailed explanation underscores the XRP Ledger’s decentralized design and governance. By highlighting the network’s structural and operational elements, he sought to dispel misconceptions perpetuated by critics like Bons. The exchange exemplifies the ongoing debate surrounding decentralization in blockchain ecosystems and the scrutiny directed at high-profile projects like XRP.

Toncoin (TON) is riding high with a 7% price increase to $6.74, fuelled by a massive surge in large transactions. Meanwhile, Hedera (HBAR) has taken a stunning leap, climbing 42% in value to $0.3548 in just 24 hours, accompanied by a whopping 91% rise in daily trading volume. These numbers aren’t just coincidences—they’re indicators of growing investor confidence and market potential. While Toncoin and Hedera are making headlines, Qubetics ($TICS) is carving out its place as the top crypto for 2024. With its presale raising over $4.2 million and groundbreaking innovations like a multi-chain wallet, Qubetics is not just joining the Web3 revolution—it’s about to lead it. But what makes these three projects stand out in a crowded market? Let’s dive in. Qubetics: The Ultimate Game-Changer with Its Multi-Chain Wallet Qubetics has quickly risen to prominence as one of the top crypto for 2024, and for good reason. At the heart of its groundbreaking innovations lies the multi-chain wallet application—a feature that redefines how users interact with the blockchain. Forget the hassle of managing separate wallets for Bitcoin, Ethereum, $TICS, and other cryptocurrencies. Qubetics’ multi-chain wallet integrates all your digital assets into one seamless platform, allowing users to transfer, store, and convert cryptocurrencies effortlessly. For businesses and individuals alike, this functionality is nothing short of revolutionary. Picture this: a freelance web designer working with clients across the globe, getting paid in multiple cryptocurrencies. Without a unified wallet solution, managing these transactions could feel like a full-time job. Enter the Qubetics multi-chain wallet—a one-stop solution that not only supports a wide range of blockchains but also offers smooth conversion mechanisms, debit card integration, and gasless $TICS transactions.

The buzz around Qubetics doesn’t end with its technology; the numbers tell a compelling story. The ongoing presale has already raised over $4.2 million, with more than 261 million $TICS tokens sold to over 6,000 holders. At the presale price of $0.0282, early investors are seeing the opportunity of a lifetime. With $TICS predicted to reach $0.25 at the presale’s conclusion, a $15,000 investment could balloon to $132,000. But it gets even better—when $TICS soars to $15 post-mainnet launch, that same investment could yield an astonishing $7.95 million. With its game-changing multi-chain wallet and wealth-generation potential, Qubetics has solidified its spot as a top crypto for 2024. Learn more about Qubetics in detail in this video . Toncoin: A Stable Force with Growing Market Confidence Toncoin (TON) has solidified its position as a key player in the blockchain landscape, boasting a 7% price increase in the past 7 days, bringing it to $6.74.

37202897,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51309,1733301010,Ethereum’s (ETH) 9404% Rally from 2017: Why a $0.125 Altcoin is Expected to Repeat it in 2025,"Ethereum (ETH) saw an amazing surge in 2017, rising by a startling 9404%. Both experienced investors and newbies alike were drawn to this amazing performance since the digital asset turned out to be among the most successful cryptocurrencies ever produced. With its explosive rise, Ethereum demonstrated the ability of creative ideas and market momentum to provide investors with large rewards. Could another altcoin, though, duplicate this in 2025? Rexas Finance (RXS), a platform devoted to Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization, is one intriguing prospect that has drawn the attention of investors. Given its outstanding presale success and mounting project interest, many analysts believe Rexas Finance may follow Ethereum’s lead and provide notable returns in the future. Currently valued at 0.125 USDT, Rexas Finance is projected to repeat Ethereum’s amazing surge in 2025 for the following reasons: Rexas Finance (RXS): A Revolutionary Project for Real-World Asset Tokenization The fundamental goal of Rexas Finance is the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). Users can tokenize actual assets and trade them on the blockchain, therefore including everything from real estate to commodities. Rexas Finance is enabling asset management to be more liquid, transparent, and accessible by using blockchain technology. Traditional asset management systems are often complicated, exclusive, and slow. Rexas Finance provides a distributed, user-friendly platform for generating, maintaining, and trading tokenized assets, hence streamlining this process. This is a big change from the centralized systems that rule the financial scene today. Rexas Finance leads in real-world asset tokenization as the demand for distributed finance (DeFi) solutions rises and positions itself in front of this new market. Rexas Finance targets industries traditionally out of reach for everyday investors, such as real estate and luxury commodities. This expansion into sectors with immense potential for growth means that as more people embrace the tokenization of real-world assets, Rexas Finance’s ecosystem could grow exponentially. The predicted expansion of Rexas Finance is mainly driven by growing demand for actual asset tokenization. The blockchain presents a workable answer, while the conventional financial scene needs to improve its efficiency, high costs, and a lack of openness. Tokenizing real-world assets appeals to companies and individual investors since it increases liquidity, reduces expenses, and makes more safe transactions possible. The Rexas Finance platform allows one to tokenize real estate, commodities, and even fine art, providing a broad spectrum of investment options. Rexas Finance aims to gain from the predicted rise in demand for tokenized assets as more people learn about these changes. Rexas Finance is poised to profit from the expanding market for tokenized assets in much the same manner that Ethereum seized on the rise of distributed apps. The Rexas Finance (RXS) Presale With the token price climbing from $0.03 to $0.125 as of Stage 9, Rexas Finance’s presale has been an enormous success. Investors who got in early have already seen impressive returns of over 260%. Rexas Finance has significant momentum, with Stage 9 presently in progress at $0.125. As the project approaches its official release at $0.20 in Q1 2025, the token price is predicted to keep rising. Once RXS reaches significant markets, analysts estimate its price might rise as high as $12 or more. The growing desire for real-world asset tokenization, together with the excellent presale performance of the project, point to Rexas Finance perhaps seeing a significant surge akin to Ethereum’s 9404% increase in 2017. Furthermore, the presale success reflects investor confidence. The fact that Rexas Finance generated over $20.75 million in just three months from its presale indicates that its offerings are much sought after. The token price is projected to keep rising as more people learn about the project’s possibility and as it keeps developing its platform. Why Rexas Finance Could Repeat Ethereum’s Success Rexas Finance has various elements to its advantage, enabling it to match Ethereum’s explosive ascent. First, the initiative provides a solution with great real-world impact and addresses a significant void in the financial industry—asset tokenization. Rexas Finance is positioned to become a major participant in this expanding market as more sectors start to tokenize assets. Second, the increasing interest in DeFi and blockchain technology drives attention toward innovative projects like Rexas Finance. Rexas Finance could become the preferred tool for tokenizing actual assets, much as Ethereum evolved as the basis for distributed apps. Finally, the success of the presale and rising interest in Rexas Finance indicate that this initiative is about to become really significant. Like Ethereum did in 2017, the price of RXS might explode in 2025 as the initiative gathers steam. Early investors who perceive Rexas Finance’s potential at its present 0.125 USDT could have large profits in the next years.

37202540,180889,1733300887,BNB Chain Ecosystem Expands Web3 Applications with Emphasis on AI Integration,"Dubai, UAE, December 4th, 2024, Chainwire In November, the humid air of Bangkok was alive with energy. Devcon’s bustling crowds mirrored the excitement of Bitcoin shattering the $90,000 mark while whispers of memecoins rippled across social media like an electric undercurrent. Traffic stood still, streets painted in the red hues of gridlock. The same shade of red glimmered in the eyes of hackathon developers—exhausted yet exhilarated from intense, time-bound coding sessions. Amid this charged atmosphere, BNB Chain’s Bangkok Hackathon cut through the usual noise and stood firm as the ideal platform of real Web3 innovation. Inside the hackathon venue, the air was cool, and the space buzzed with quiet determination—if by ""quiet,"" you mean the sound of frantic keyboard smashing and occasional cries of “I can't find the bug!” Tom Yum-flavored chips were the first to vanish, as if hoarded by a mysterious snack bandit, while Coca-Cola fueled developers with the jittery resolve of people who had made terrible sleep-related life choices. By the end of the 24-hour coding marathon, 38 projects had emerged, along with a collective realization that “debugging at 3 am” is its own unique form of self-inflicted punishment. Eight teams earned coveted presentation slots, half of them from India. Three secured funding for their next steps, exchanging handshakes and whispered “good luck” that hinted at larger ambitions. This was more than a competition—it was the spark that ignited a storm, a whirlwind of innovation and ambition poised to reshape the landscape of Web3. The “Silent” Years of BNB Chain “BNB Chain is dead.” It’s a phrase that echoed across certain corners of the Web3 community in recent years, painting a picture of stagnation. Yet, beneath this perception lay a quiet but undeniable momentum. As of November, BNB Chain ranks consistently among the top blockchains, standing third in stablecoin market cap and fourth in total value locked (TVL) at over $8 billion. It handles one-sixth of all blockchain transactions globally. The ecosystem boasts 218 developer tools, 800 active applications, and a growing footprint in DeFi, gaming, and AI. One of BNB Chain’s crown jewels is its Most Valuable Builder (MVB) program, launched in 2021 to incubate early-stage projects. Of the 131 projects nurtured across seven cohorts, 75 received backing from top-tier investment firms, and over 60 successfully launched their tokens, with many listed on major exchanges. Five MVB Projects such as Galaxy, Mobox, SpaceID,SleeplessAI and Altlayer listed on Binance Launchpool, owe their growth to this quiet yet impactful initiative. In a space where attrition often overshadows progress, BNB Chain’s ability to sustain and elevate projects speaks volumes. Building Toward the Horizon While Solana has captured attention with its memecoin boom, BNB Chain observes with a clear understanding of the broader picture. Memecoins are undoubtedly a cultural phenomenon, and while their numbers on BNB Chain may currently be fewer, platforms like Four.meme and ongoing ecosystem initiatives lay the groundwork for a more sustainable and impactful memecoin presence in the future. However, BNB Chain’s ambitions extend well beyond fleeting trends. Its focus lies in creating an ecosystem designed for longevity, driving innovation in critical areas like DeFi, gaming, AI, and stablecoins. By prioritizing meaningful, real-world applications, BNB Chain is quietly laying the foundation for the next chapter of Web3—one that emphasizes utility and growth over hype. To help build this vision, BNB Chain has adopted a three-phase development strategy. Three-Phased Strategy for Development BNB Chain’s approach to fostering innovation is deliberate and structured: Early-Stage Incubation : Through initiatives like hackathons and the BNB Incubation Alliance (BIA) program, promising ideas receive crucial funding and resources. The MVB program takes this further, offering tailored incubation sessions that provide targeted support over several weeks. Mid-Stage Deployment : Once projects launch, they benefit from ecosystem incentives tied to key performance metrics such as daily active users, TVL, and transaction volume. These incentives are bolstered by technical guidance, marketing assistance, and customer support to ensure sustained growth. Late-Stage Growth : As projects mature, they gain deeper integration into BNB Chain’s ecosystem. This stage includes access to investment opportunities, exchange listings, and long-term development resources, helping projects scale and thrive. Supporting these efforts is the robust “One BNB” ecosystem, which provides the technological backbone for innovation: BSC,opBNB and decentralised storage chain Greenfield. Together, these interconnected components form a dynamic foundation that empowers both developers and users, ensuring every idea has the resources and infrastructure needed to succeed. Empowering AI and Beyond AI is one of BNB Chain’s most promising frontiers. With over 30 active AI-related deployments, seven of them have been invested by Binance Labs, the ecosystem supports applications like My Shell, NFPrompt, and zkPass. Data labeling projects like DIN, Alaya AI, and JoloWorld. According to DappRadar data as of November 20, Din ranks first among all AI applications with nearly 700,000 weekly active addresses, and seventh among all categories. Greenfield’s decentralized storage capabilities resonate with data-intensive projects, aligning perfectly with emerging decentralized science (DeSci) initiatives. In fact, Greenfield’s impact extends beyond AI. It offers researchers and data-centric projects the tools to store, own, and monetize data securely—unlocking new possibilities in decentralized research and intellectual property management. Beyond AI, BNB Chain’s influence spans multiple sectors: DeFi : BTCFi Projects like Solv Protocol and Avalon Labs showcase impressive TVL growth, with many emerging from the MVB program. Gaming : During the GameFi boom, BNB Chain hosted over 40% of gaming projects, generating immense developer and player engagement. Games like Seraph and Gomble Games consistently attract hundreds of thousands of weekly active users. A Vision for the Future In an industry fixated on chasing the next big trend, BNB Chain stands apart with its unwavering commitment to building for the long term. It doesn’t follow the noise—it creates the foundation. Through relentless infrastructure innovation, empowering developer programs, and a sharp focus on transformative sectors like AI, gaming, and DeFi, BNB Chain is not just preparing for the future of Web3—it’s shaping it. Its vision of onboarding the next billion users may sound ambitious, but with its deliberate and strategic progress, it feels less like a lofty aspiration and more like an inevitable reality. BNB Chain may not shout the loudest, but it doesn’t need to. In a landscape often driven by fleeting hype, its quiet determination, pragmatic approach, and steadfast focus are what set it apart—and what will ensure its place as a cornerstone of the Web3 revolution. About BNB Chain BNB Chain is a community-driven blockchain ecosystem that is removing barriers to Web3 adoption. It is composed of: BNB Smart Chain (BSC) : A secure DeFi hub with the lowest gas fees of any EVM-compatible L1; serves as the ecosystem’s governance chain. opBNB : A scalability L2 that delivers some of the lowest gas fees of any L2 and rapid processing speeds. BNB Greenfield : Meets decentralized storage needs for the ecosystem and lets users establish their own data marketplaces. Setting a high bar for security, the AvengerDAO community protects BNB Chain users while Red Alarm provides a real-time risk-scanner for Dapps. The ecosystem also offers a range of monetary and ecosystem rewards as part of its Builder Support Program . For more, users can follow BNB Chain on X or start exploring via the Dapp library .

This move follows Binance’s routine review process, which evaluates factors like trading volume and liquidity. While the decision may not affect all users, it’s important for those holding positions in these pairs to be aware of the upcoming changes. Keep reading to find out why these pairs are being removed and what this means for you. Why Are These Pairs Being Removed? Binance explained that it regularly reviews all trading pairs to ensure the platform runs smoothly for users. The NOT/BNB and RDNT/BTC pairs are being removed because they don’t have enough trading activity and liquidity. In simple terms, these pairs are not being traded enough to meet Binance’s standards for keeping them available. Binance is committed to offering a high-quality experience for its users. As part of this, the exchange only keeps trading pairs with enough activity and liquidity to ensure smooth and efficient trading. When Will The Delisting Take Place? The delisting will take place on December 6, 2024, at 03:00 UTC. Meanwhile, from that moment, users will no longer be able to trade NOT/BNB or RDNT/BTC on Binance. However, Binance will not be removing the individual tokens from the platform altogether. Users can still trade the base and quote assets of these pairs in other available markets on Binance. Action Needed for Spot Trading Bot Users If you use Spot Trading Bots with these pairs, you need to act quickly. Binance will stop supporting these pairs for trading bots on December 6 at 03:00 UTC . This means any active bots using these pairs will be stopped. To avoid issues or losses, users are strongly advised to update or cancel their bots before the delisting. For most Binance users, the impact of this change will be minimal, as long as they are not heavily invested in these specific trading pairs. With delistings like these, Binance is clearly focusing on quality over quantity to provide users with the best possible trading environment.

37202346,https://invezz.com/?p=2352854,1733300483,Monero price prediction: here’s why XMR could surge soon,"Monero price made a strong bullish breakout after spending over three years in a deep consolidation between $125 and $180. The XMR token soared to a high of $217, its highest level since May 2022. It has jumped by over 97% from its lowest point this year. Why Monero price has bounced back Monero is a highly popular privacy coin whose transactions, unlike those of other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, cannot be tracked. These privacy features have made it a controversial coin in the industry, which has pushed several exchanges to delist it over the years. It was delisted by popular names like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken. Most of Monero’s trading was happening in KuCoin, HTX, Bitfinex, Gate, MEXC, and Xt.com. Therefore, the XMR coin is rebounding as crypto investors rotate to old-school coins after the recent success of Ripple and Stellar. The hope is that these coins will reignite the hype and continue rising in the near term. Some analysts believe that major exchanges will decide to relist Monero after a recent court verdict about Tornado Cash. In a US ruling, three judges ruled that a US agency responsible for sanctions was not in order in sanctioning the smart contract. Addditionally, there are rising hopes that the new Trump administration will be more friendly to the crypto industry. Trump has hinted that he will ensure friendlier regulations, which will let exchanges list more tokens, including Monero. Meanwhile, there are signs that Monero is generating hype among crypto investors. In an X post, UB noted that the coin has not been above $183 in the last 900 days, and that a bullish breakout would get “silly.” As shown below, one analyst believes that Monero will be the next altcoin to giga send and that it could jump to over $600 in the near term. $Bossman @0xBossman · Follow $XMR is going to be the next altcoin to giga send once it breaks out of this rangeHeavily long here 6:49 PM · Dec 3, 2024 155 Reply Copy link Read 23 replies Monero price analysis The weekly chart shows that the XMR price has been in a tight range in the past few years. It has been left behind by other popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Tron that have soared to a record high. Monero has now made a bullish breakout and risen above the important resistance level at $180, the highest level since 2022. This price was also the upper side of the inverse head and shoulders pattern. It has also jumped above the 50-week and 200-week Exponemtial Moving Averages (EMA). The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and other oscillators have all pointed upwards, a sign that momentum is returning. Therefore, the XMR token will likely continue as bulls target the immediate resistance at $250. If that happens, it will likely rise to the key resistance at $337, its highest level in August 2021.

37201875,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373380,1733300280,"After XRP and TRX, Is PEPE The Next Altcoin to Explode in Price?","TL:DR; Several altcoins have popped up in the past few weeks to register massive double- and even triple-digit gains at some point. Will PEPE be the next in line? Some whale activity suggests so. Alts’ Rally The current crypto environment screams altseason . It all started after Donald Trump’s decisive victory in the US presidential elections when DOGE, alongside BTC, skyrocketed to new multi-year peaks, perhaps due to the asset’s affiliation with Elon Musk. Since then, bitcoin has stalled and is in consolidation mode, while DOGE has calmed . However, numerous other altcoins have started to pop up frequently. XRP was at the forefront of these rallies , surging by more than 420% within a month, charting a 7-year high, and becoming the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The past 24 hours have seen the rise of two other bright stars – Tron and Binance Coin. Both have blasted through their previous ATHs, especially the former. TRX shot up by more than 70% and jumped above $0.43 to mark a fresh peak. Other noteworthy contenders include XLM, HBAR, DOT, and AVAX. Now, the community has started to speculate on which altcoin will be next. Is PEPE Next? The third-largest meme coin also soared in value after Trump’s win and marked a new all-time high on November 14 at $0.00002457 (CoinGecko data). This came after numerous listings on large exchanges and a growing hype within the community. Similar to DOGE, though, it retraced in the following weeks and now sits below $0.000021 – or 15% away from its peak from last month. It has remained somewhat on the sidelines, with the focus going on many of the aforementioned assets. However, it seems certain large investors, known as whales, are turning their attention back to it, which could suggest a further rally. Data from Lookonchain shows that a single whale had accumulated and withdrawn nearly $7 million worth of PEPE in the past 20 days. Such large purchases and withdrawals often precede price increases due to the declining available supply and immediate sell pressure. Whales continue to accumulate $PEPE ! A whale has withdrawn 337.09B $PEPE ($6.92M) from #Binance in the past 20 days. https://t.co/65vbIQd2dd pic.twitter.com/79NauAQt8V — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 4, 2024 The post After XRP and TRX, Is PEPE The Next Altcoin to Explode in Price? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",POSITIVE,TRX | XRP | PEPE,ALTCOIN | TRADING | TRX | XRP | PEPE,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/after-xrp-and-trx-is-pepe-the-next-altcoin-to-explode-in-price/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/37201875.jpeg

37201675,https://thecoinrise.com/australia-brings-new-crypto-licensing-rules-sparks-industry-concerns/,1733299825,"Australia Brings New Crypto Licensing Rules, Sparks Industry Concerns","The Australia Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has unveiled a consultation paper proposing stringent licensing requirements for crypto firms operating within the country. Released on December 4, the guidelines categorize many digital assets as financial products, compelling firms to obtain Australian Financial Services Licenses (AFSL) or Australian Market Licenses to continue operations. The proposed regulations aim to provide clarity but have elicited mixed reactions from industry stakeholders. While compliance-focused companies see the move as necessary for legitimizing the sector, critics argue it could stifle innovation and force startups to relocate offshore. Kate Cooper, CEO of Zodia Custody, views the shift as a necessary wake-up call for the crypto industry. “Compliance is no longer optional,” she stated, urging businesses to reassess their custody and compliance practices. High Costs Raise Concerns for Startups in Australia The financial burden associated with obtaining licenses is a primary concern, particularly for smaller businesses. Liam Hennessy, a partner at Clyde & Co, warned that the hefty compliance costs could overwhelm startups, leaving the market dominated by larger players better equipped to absorb these expenses. Echoing this sentiment, Joni Pirovich, a prominent crypto lawyer, noted on LinkedIn that launching a crypto firm in Australia may now rival or exceed the costs of setting up operations overseas. This could discourage Australian entrepreneurs from entering the market locally, pushing innovation offshore. Charlie Karaboga, co-founder and CEO of Block Earner, criticized ASIC’s expectations for startups to maintain financial reserves to meet licensing requirements . With only 13 employees , Karaboga described the guidelines as potentially “crippling” for smaller ventures like his. Industry Welcomes Clarity but Questions Implementation Despite the concerns, the guidelines offer much-needed regulatory clarity , a sentiment shared by many industry leaders. “Anything which provides regulatory certainty is a positive step,” said Hennessy, adding that the move could establish Australia as a serious player in the global crypto landscape. However, some worry that the regulations are excessively stringent.

Pal tells his 1.1 million followers on the social media platform X Dogecoin ( DOGE ) is sporting a wedge pattern on the monthly chart and could be headed for gains that “look similar in potential magnitude” to those of XRP. A wedge pattern is characterized by converging trend lines and is considered bullish if price breaks out from above the upper trendline. “ Insane banana chart.” Source: Raoul Pal/X A “Banana” chart or zone is a metaphor Pal uses to describe a bullish period for crypto assets where a rapid increase in prices occurs in the shape of the yellow fruit or a parabola. Dogecoin is trading at $0.404 at time of writing, up by around 172% over the past 30 days. Turning to XRP, Pal says that the third-largest crypto asset by market cap has broken out of the wedge pattern on the monthly time frame. “Last time, it [XRP] broke a long wedge pattern it rose another 5,600%! (obviously won’t repeat but you get the point – it can go up a lot.)” Source: Raoul Pal/X XRP is trading at $2.57 at time of writing, up by around 424% over the past 30 days. Turning to Sui ( SUI ), the former Goldman Sachs executive says that the 21st-largest crypto asset by market cap is flashing a bullish signal against Solana ( SOL ). Pal says that SUI/SOL is sporting an inverse head and shoulders pattern on the daily time frame and he is watching the chart “like a hawk.” An inverse head and shoulders pattern is typically a bullish signal if price breaks out to the upside.

This latest development adds to the ongoing management of billions of dollars in digital assets confiscated from high-profile crypto collapses. These massive transfers are creating a panic in the bullish crypto market which saw a consecutive green after months of stagnant phase. Bitcoin is hovering around $96K and altcoins are also making good gains with regulations at ease. At this moment these US transfers tell a different story. Let’s dive into the insight. Massive Transfers of SHIB and ETH On December 3, Arkham Intelligence reported that 54.8 billion Shiba Inu tokens (SHIB), valued at $1.55 million, were transferred to a new wallet. Shortly after, $17.2 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) followed, sparking attention from blockchain analysts monitoring government wallet activities. Beyond SHIB and ETH, the U.S. government also moved several smaller assets, including 13.5 million Binance USD (BUSD), $36,070 of Axie Infinity (AXS), and $296,000 in various other cryptocurrencies. These included Compound (COMP), Numeraire (NMR), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), and Yearn Finance (YFI). Bitcoin Seizures Continue In addition to the recent FTX-related transfers, Bitcoin seizures remain a major focus. Earlier this year, the government moved nearly $2 billion worth of Bitcoin to new wallets. These transactions were linked to earlier cases, such as the Silk Road investigation, highlighting the scale of digital assets under federal control. As of now, the U.S. government holds a staggering $19.48 billion in digital assets, primarily Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, WBTC, and BNB. These holdings reflect the outcomes of several high-profile crypto investigations, including FTX’s collapse in November 2022 due to alleged mismanagement. Implications for the Crypto Market The U.S. government recently moved seized cryptocurrencies, including $17.2 million in Ethereum, just as the crypto market is rallying. In the meanwhile, Ethereum has risen to $3,643, and November saw a record $183.74 billion in trading volume. The government also moved 54.89 billion SHIB, which has raised serious selling pressure on the market. While it’s unclear what will happen to these assets, it highlights the growing role of digital currencies in legal matters and regulations.",NEGATIVE,AXS | BTC | ETH | SHIB,AXS | BTC | ETH | MARKET | SHIB,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-market-alert-s-transfers-17-2m-eth-54-8b-shib-and-more/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37201507,https://crypto.news/?p=14316038,1733299430,South Korean martial law catapults crypto trading volume to new record high with $34b,"After the implementation of the South Korean martial law, the country’s five major crypto exchanges recorded a spot trading volume of over $34 billion in the past 24 hours, setting a new record high. According to data from CoinMarketCap , in the past 24 hours the combined crypto spot trading volume from Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit and Gopax reached a volume of $34.2 billion in the 24 hours leading up to 10:30 am EST. South Korea’s trading volume surged nearly 50% after the nation’s trading volume broke its previous record with $18 billion on Dec. 2, surpassing stock market volumes by 22%. The massive surge is thought to have been triggered by the unrest in the country that followed the implementation of an emergency curfew via the martial law by President Yoon Suk-yeol. The martial law was called off after six hours. According to local media outlet News1 , South Korean traders rushed to sell their cryptocurrencies on the local exchanges which caused the prices to drop to 88 million won. Some exchanges even experienced site outages due to the massive spike in trading activity. Upbit , South Korea’s largest exchange, contributed the biggest portion of today’s crypto spot trading volume, with $27.25 billion worth of crypto. Bithumb came in second with a spot trading volume of more than $6.14 billion in the past 24 hours of trading. You might also like: South Korea’s crypto trading outpaces its stock market by 22%, hits $18B in 24H Meanwhile, the crypto exchange Coinone accumulated a trading volume of more than $531 million in the past 24 hours. This was followed by Korbit with $192 million worth of crypto trading volume and Gopax with nearly $9 million. The South Korean martial law came into effect on Dec. 3 at 23:00 KST. Citizens were banned from conducting protests and the media was placed under government control. The nation’s parliament and political groups were forbidden from holding activities that would challenge the law. President Yoon decided to enact emergency martial law because he claimed it was a necessary precaution to protect the country from “North Korea’s communist forces” and to “eliminate anti-state elements.” Though, many have speculated that it was a desperate act done to combat the domestic pressure that could lead to the President’s impeachment. What impact did the South Korean martial law have on the crypto market? Shortly after the martial law was decreed, political unrest broke out in South Korea. Thousands of South Koreans rushed to the heavily-guarded parliament building to protest, after politicians criticized Yoon’s decision as illegal and unconstitutional. According to the BBC , footage from the site showed some protesters fighting police at the gates. Even regulators had to climb over fences to make it to the voting chamber so that they could overrule the martial law. As previously reported by crypto.news , crypto prices in South Korea plummeted along with the South Korean won. Bitcoin ( BTC ) price fell to its lowest level since Oct. 5 at around 88 million won. Ethereum ( ETH ) also reached its lowest level as it fell to 4.2 million won. Meanwhile, the price of other altcoins like Ripple ( XRP ), Stellar Lumens ( XLM ) and Solana ( SOL ) plummeted by double digits. This evident drop in crypto prices was caused by investors rushing to liquidate their assets in the midst of the political chaos. Similar sell-offs occurred after the Ukraine war started and the COVID-19 pandemic.

As of January 2, the Treasury Department must operate under the reinstated limit, kicking off its usual bag of “extraordinary measures” to avoid default. This includes draining its cash reserves in the Treasury General Account (TGA) and cutting back on Treasury bill (T-bill) issuance, all while the Fed is knee-deep in quantitative tightening (QT). Things were already complicated, but this might send the Fed flying blind. The TGA is a key liability on the Fed’s balance sheet, meaning changes to its balance directly affect liquidity in the financial system. When the Treasury spends down its cash pile, bank reserves and demand for the Fed’s reverse repo facility (RRP) shoot up. Extraordinary measures and a tightrope walk Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has no choice but to deploy extraordinary measures, including halting investments in federal retirement funds and borrowing from the Exchange Stabilization Fund. The goal is simple: buy time until Congress gets its act together. But this temporary game plan has real consequences. The TGA will shrink, artificially pumping more cash into markets, while the Fed keeps reducing its balance sheet. Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at TD Securities, explained it like this: “The Fed may be flying blind in monitoring the impact of QT as the debt ceiling starts to pressure TGA balances lower.” His concern is that when the ceiling is lifted, the sudden rebuilding of the TGA could cause reserves to drop dangerously low, creating liquidity problems. The current reserve level of $3.23 trillion might seem abundant, but nobody knows how quickly “enough” can turn into “scarce.” Fed officials are worried too. Minutes from their November meeting revealed a focus on the debt ceiling’s ripple effects. According to the New York Fed’s survey, most market participants expect QT to end by mid-2025, but the debt ceiling drama could throw those predictions off. Last time, in 2023, the RRP held $2.2 trillion in liquidity as a buffer. Now, it’s barely above $150 billion. Rebuilding the TGA will hit reserves harder and faster than it did during previous crises. Funding markets are a powder keg Funding markets are a different beast compared to 2023. Hedge funds have doubled down on long Treasury positions, and much of that collateral is now sitting outside the banking system. In July, dealer balance-sheet constraints and repo limitations kept cash stubbornly parked at the RRP. Tobias noted, “Capacity constraints, as well as counterparty risk limits, could push money market fund cash into the RRP.” This disrupts liquidity redistribution, precisely when demand for financing continues to rise. Wall Street is split on what happens next. Deutsche Bank says the Fed might need to slow QT or pause it altogether if things spiral. But they don’t expect a full stop unless Congress completely drops the ball. The harrowing X-date Before Donald Trump’s election win, analysts pegged the so-called X-date (a term for when the government runs out of cash) around August 2025. That’s out the window now. With Republicans taking the White House and Congress , the deadline could move up to the second quarter of 2025. A unified GOP government might reach a quicker agreement to lift the ceiling, but don’t hold your breath. Barclays strategist Joseph Abate warned that politics, not economics, will dictate the timeline. “Getting a bill to the House floor may not be quick,” he said, predicting the ceiling won’t be suspended until late spring. This brinkmanship will likely hammer front-end Treasury rates as the government reduces its supply of short-term debt. Investors, spooked by potential default risks, will dump vulnerable T-bills , creating bizarre distortions in the yield curve. This isn’t the first rodeo. During previous debt ceiling standoffs, agreements came down to the wire, often within a week of a government cash crunch. JPMorgan points out that the ugliest fights happen under a Democratic president and a Republican-controlled Congress. This time, with the GOP in charge, the battle might be less brutal.

The flagship cryptocurrency recorded a net inflow of $230 million on Dec. 3. BTC exchange net flow | Source: IntoTheBlock In total, over $562 million in Bitcoin entered CEX platforms, ITB data shows. Moreover, the asset’s large holder-to-exchange net flow ratio rose to 0.86% on Tuesday, per ITB data. The indicator suggests that Bitcoin whales have been more active than retail holders. You might also like: Whale accumulates millions dollars LINK, token price surges 28% Data from the analytics platform shows that large Bitcoin transactions, worth at least $100,000, also increased from 17,960 to 25,830 in the same timeframe as the exchange net flows. The large transaction volume surged from $38.7 billion to $87.3 billion in BTC on Monday, Dec. 2. Bitcoin recorded a total of $169.6 billion in whale transactions over the last seven days, according to ITB. On-chain data shows that an 11-year-old whale address with 2,700 BTC, worth over $257 million, transferred the Bitcoin holding to another wallet for the first time since December 2013, hinting at a potential selloff due to the 157 times return. The whale accumulated the Bitcoins when the price was hovering around $625 for a total of $1.68 million. Bitcoin is hovering at $96,500 after gaining 1% over the past 24 hours. Its market cap surpassed the $1.9 trillion market again. The increased exchange inflows could trigger FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) among retail investors. However, a spike in whale accumulation could shift the market sentiment and bring buying pressure. At this point, the next major bullish catalyst for Bitcoin and altcoins would be the potential U.S. Federal Reserve’s rate cut — the FOMC meeting is scheduled for Dec. 17 and 18.

Options Market Show Increased Downside Protection","As attention shifts to altcoins, Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a pause in the uptrend that has characterized the past month. Currently trading 3.8% below its record high of $99,540, questions are raised about the sustainability of this growth and the possibility of a correction as the year draws to a close. Investors Flock To Ethereum And XRP Chris Newhouse, director of research at Cumberland Labs, pointed out that while strong institutional buying pressure persists—particularly from companies like MicroStrategy, which continues to accumulate Bitcoin—there is a noticeable shift in capital flows. Newhouse noted that the broader crypto ecosystem is experiencing a “diversification of capital flows” from both institutional and non-institutional participants. This diversification indicates that as Bitcoin stabilizes, investor interest is increasingly shifting to other digital assets, including Ethereum (ETH) and XRP, which had previously lagged behind Bitcoin. Related Reading: XRP Q3 Overview: Key Metrics Suggest A Bright Future For The Third Biggest Crypto Following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump, who has emerged as a crypto advocate, expectations for more favorable US regulations have risen. This has contributed to the massive rally in the XRP price, which has seen a 400% increase in the monthly time frame. This optimism is also reflected in the record monthly net inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in November, which reached $6.5 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. Bloomberg data shows that last Friday marked an all-time high for daily Ether ETF subscriptions. $2 Billion Silk Road Bitcoin Moved To Coinbase In the options market, there has been a noticeable increase in downside protection for Bitcoin at later expiries this month. Meanwhile, BTC futures have exhibited moderate leverage, remaining relatively subdued after Bitcoin surpassed the $99,000 mark. According to Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33, on-chain data suggests that traders who purchased BTC in the $55,000 to $70,000 range are now actively realizing profits. “Profit-taking has been particularly intense with BTC trading north of $90,000,” Lunde remarked. Jake Ostrovskis, a trader at Wintermute OTC, observed that “the market has taken a pause over the last 10 days as Bitcoin sits just under $100,000. Volatility levels have compressed slightly, with Bitcoin in the 64th percentile and Ether significantly higher at the 81st.” This volatility compression suggests a cautious sentiment among traders as they assess the market’s next moves, with the potential for a fresh wave of lower support levels to be retested in BTC’s price action, which could jeopardize the $100,000 milestone being reached by the end of the year.

According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $675.97 million inflows on Tuesday, nearly doubling the $353.67 million seen the previous day. These investment vehicles have now enjoyed four consecutive days of net inflows, totaling over $1.45 billion within that span. BlackRock ’s IBIT led the pack for the third consecutive day, with $693.25 million in inflows to the fund.

In the meantime, Australia is also reviewing its approach to crypto taxation, with the Department of Treasury seeking guidance from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. As crypto.news reported earlier, the Treasury is weighing two options: adopting the OECD’s Crypto Asset Reporting Framework or tailoring it to domestic needs. CARF aims to boost tax transparency by collecting data on crypto transactions, including purchases over $50,000, and sharing it with global authorities.

""We recently made the strategic decision to focus Foundry on our core business – operating the #1 Bitcoin mining pool in the world and growing our site operations business – while we supported the development of DCG’s newest subsidiaries, including Yuma and the spinout of Foundry’s successful self-mining business.""  A spokesperson for the company said DCG's most recent shareholder letter already disclosed plans for this realignment.  ""As part of this realignment, we made the difficult decision to reduce Foundry’s workforce, resulting in layoffs across multiple teams. We’re grateful for the contributions of all our employees, including those impacted by these changes,” the spokesperson continued.  In total, Foundry reduced its headcount by 27%, from 274 to 200, Foundry CEO Mike Coyler told Blockspace.  Foundry’s mining pool — which allows various miners to band their computational resources together in order to produce more blocks — accounts for almost 32% of Bitcoin’s total hashrate, making it the largest pool on the network.  The bitcoin mining firm also has other business lines, which include mining site operations, hardware production, ASIC repairs, mining shipments, technical education and self-mining.  About 20 staff members were also moved from Foundry to another DCG subsidiary, Yuma, which focuses on AI development, according to Blockspace.  Across the board, miners are under pressure to cut costs as the halving cuts the number of new bitcoins created per block in half, making mining less profitable.  The bitcoin hashprice index, a measure of the earnings a miner can anticipate from a given amount of hashrate, is down significantly over the last year to roughly $60 per hash/day, down from an average of around $100 in December – however the price has ticked up in the last three months.  In a recent report, investment bank JPMorgan said that the notional value of all remaining bitcoin left to be mined is $74 billion given current bitcoin prices and the miners' stocks have been underperforming.  Bitcoin is up over 130% in the last year, according to CoinDesk data.   UPDATE (Dec. 4, 12:27 UTC): Company changes spokesperson to Foundry representative.

37201304,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51308,1733298624,Here’s MicroStrategy’s Whopping Profit If Saylor Bought XRP Instead of Bitcoin,"A recent analysis by financial expert and value investor Jacob King on X has highlighted an intriguing scenario for cryptocurrency investors. Jacob asserts that MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, could have drastically boosted its return on investment (ROI) if the firm had allocated its $21.91 billion cryptocurrency portfolio to XRP rather than Bitcoin (BTC). If Michael Saylor had bought $XRP instead of $BTC , MicroStrategy’s $21.91 billion investment would now be worth approximately $81.94 billion, yielding a 274% ROI. That would be OVER $60 billion in additional profits! pic.twitter.com/zqMPx2Rwo6 — Jacob King (@JacobKinge) December 2, 2024 This scenario underscores the potential missed opportunities in their investment strategy. According to King’s calculations, such a move would have generated a 274% ROI, translating to $81.94 billion in value—over $60 billion more than its current Bitcoin holdings. King’s Analysis and Its Context The accompanying chart shared by King demonstrates a marked divergence in the price trajectories of XRP and Bitcoin . The visual comparison emphasizes XRP’s strong upward momentum relative to Bitcoin’s more subdued price performance during the same period. King’s argument reflects a hypothetical shift in MicroStrategy’s investment strategy, showcasing the potential impact of selecting a highly volatile but high-performing asset like XRP. In response to this hypothetical scenario, another user, Andrew “Old IT Guy” Wade, emphasized several important considerations regarding altcoins like XRP. He pointed out that MicroStrategy’s investment would represent a substantial portion of XRP’s total market capitalization, potentially distorting the market. Additionally, the large volume of XRP required for such an investment might destabilize the asset’s price if sold. Moreover, XRP carries a fundamentally different risk profile compared to Bitcoin, which many investors consider a more established and reliable store of value. From a financial perspective, Jacob King’s analysis underscores the importance of timing and asset selection in maximizing returns. While XRP’s recent performance has outpaced Bitcoin’s, it is crucial to recognize that past performance does not guarantee future results. Additionally, investments of MicroStrategy’s scale would likely encounter liquidity and market impact challenges, especially in the case of altcoins with relatively smaller market capitalizations than Bitcoin. Bitcoin remains the most widely adopted cryptocurrency, boasting a market cap of over $500 billion as of December 2024. Its liquidity, regulatory clarity, and acceptance as a digital gold standard provide a risk-adjusted appeal that aligns with MicroStrategy’s long-term strategy. Despite XRP’s growing adoption in cross-border payments and favorable developments in its legal disputes, it operates within a smaller ecosystem and remains subject to unique risks. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Risk-Reward Considerations The comparison between XRP and Bitcoin extends beyond ROI metrics. It includes broader considerations like market stability, regulatory environments, and investor perception. XRP has experienced significant price surges recently, driven by optimism surrounding its use cases and legal clarity in the U.S. While Jacob King’s analysis showcases the hypothetical profitability of investing in XRP over Bitcoin, it also highlights the complexity of managing large-scale cryptocurrency investments. XRP’s recent price performance illustrates its potential for significant returns, yet its market dynamics and risk profile make it a fundamentally different asset compared to Bitcoin. For institutional investors like MicroStrategy, the decision to prioritize Bitcoin over altcoins such as XRP reflects a strategic focus on stability, liquidity, and long-term growth. This discussion serves as a reminder of the multifaceted considerations that underpin investment decisions in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

37201092,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373372,1733298508,Is Tron (TRX) The Next Ripple (XRP)?,"TL:DR; Tron’s price flew through the roof in the past 12 hours or so, smashing its previous record and charting a new one a lot higher. This came amid a compelling post from Tron’s founder that compared the protocol’s native token against another high-flyer as of late – XRP. TRX’s Explosion It seems like the recent prediction by CryptoQuant’s CEO – Ki Young Ju, about the current altcoin season is coming true. He said that it will be a different altseason as only a selected handful of assets will skyrocket periodically. After alts like DOGE , XRP, HBAR, and XLM, the past 24 hours belonged to Tron’s native token. There are no better words to describe TRX’s movements since yesterday than a full-on explosion that pushed its price from $0.23 past its 2018 all-time high and toward a new one of $0.43, according to CoinGecko. $TRX broke the 7 year old all-time high! We need to show respect. One of the very few Crypto‘s which beat Bitcoin over multiple cycles! I will wait for a good long entry, my spot position remains untouched. pic.twitter.com/4G30eHaYft — MMCrypto (@MMCrypto) December 3, 2024 Aside from the apparent ongoing altseason, some of the reasons behind this impressive rally could be related to the overall developments within the Tron ecosystem. It continues to be at the forefront of Tether (USDT) transactions as well as it has seen the launch of numerous trendy projects like sun.pump. Additionally, the founder – Justin Sun, has been very active lately, especially in terms of spending cash, which includes a sizeable investment in Donald Trump’s crypto project. TRX = XRP? Sun also made an intriguing comparison as TRX’s rally was beginning, and the asset had just broken its 2018 all-time high. TRX=XRP — H.E. Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) December 3, 2024 Recall the price actions of Ripple’s cross-border token. The cryptocurrency became the top performer shortly after Trump won the elections, especially following Gary Gensler’s announcement about leaving the SEC. At one point, XRP had surged by over 420% on a monthly basis. Moreover, the token trades at a multi-year peak of its own, nearing $3 earlier this week. It has become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and continues to capture the community’s attention through its price movements. TRX’s monthly surge of ‘only’ 135% is a lot more modest, but it managed to break its previous all-time high. As of now, TRX’s market cap remains about 5x lower than XRP’s but the crypto market is a wild place especially in the past month so everything can happen these days.

37203302,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315973,1733298485,Hydra Founder Sentenced to Life in Prison by Russian Court for Running $5 Billion Crypto Black Market,"Stanislav Moiseev, the mastermind behind the notorious online black market and cryptocurrency mixing service Hydra, has been handed a life sentence by a Russian court. Hydra reportedly facilitated over $5 billion in cryptocurrency transactions before its closure, becoming the largest darknet marketplace in the world. The Moscow Regional Court found Moiseev and 15 accomplices guilty of organizing a criminal enterprise and engaging in the illegal production and distribution of psychotropic substances and drugs. Verdict Includes Prison Sentences for Moiseev’s Co-Conspirators The verdict, announced on December 2, included prison sentences ranging from 8 to 23 years for Moiseev’s co-conspirators. Additionally, Moiseev was fined 4 million rubles ($38,100), while the group collectively faced penalties amounting to 16 million rubles ($152,400). Authorities also confiscated properties and vehicles linked to the defendants. According to Russian state media outlet TASS, Moiseev and his associates will serve their sentences in strict-regime correctional colonies. Hydra’s operations, which ran from 2015 until its takedown in 2022, accounted for an estimated 80% of all darknet-related cryptocurrency transactions in 2021. U.S. Justice Department records reveal the platform’s staggering $5.2 billion in crypto revenue during its operation. Hydra’s infamy stemmed from its role in selling stolen credit card information, counterfeit currencies, and fake identity documents. DARKNET BOSS GETS LIFE SENTENCE Stanislav Moiseev – the man behind Hydra – aka the darknet’s ""Amazon"" – just got slammed with a life sentence in Russia. His squad of 15 will join him in jail for the slinging of illicit goods on the platform and laundering billions of dollars.… pic.twitter.com/PmxKgyXeAT — Mario Nawfal’s Roundtable (@RoundtableSpace) December 4, 2024 Blockchain security firm Flashpoint, now affiliated with TRM Labs, reported a 624% surge in Hydra’s crypto volumes on exchanges between 2018 and 2020, highlighting the sophistication of its criminal activities. The platform’s downfall came in April 2022, when German authorities seized Hydra’s servers and its Bitcoin reserves, shutting down the operation. At the time, Hydra boasted 17 million customers and 19,000 vendor accounts. German law enforcement also confiscated nearly a ton of narcotics and psychotropic substances during the raid. Hydra’s criminal activities had been under investigation by Russia’s Ministry of Internal Affairs since 2016. Those convicted alongside Moiseev include Alexander Chirkov, Andrei Trunov, Evgeny Andreev, and others. Their sentences remain subject to appeal. Despite Hydra’s closure, darknet marketplaces have continued to thrive. A report by Chainalysis earlier this year revealed that darknet revenues exceeded $1.7 billion in 2023, surpassing figures from 2022. Federal Court Overturns US Sanctions On Tornado Cash Last week, a US appeals court overturned sanctions imposed by the Treasury Department on Tornado Cash, a crypto mixer that enables privacy in transactions. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on 26 November 2024 that the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) exceeded its authority by targeting Tornado Cash’s immutable smart contracts, granting its users a partial summary judgment. The three-judge panel argued that Tornado Cash’s smart contracts are not “property” under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The Tornado Cash contracts, which operate as immutable lines of privacy-focused code, cannot be owned or controlled by any individual or entity, making them ineligible for sanctions under the IEEPA. “We hold that Tornado Cash’s immutable smart contracts are not the ‘property’ of a foreign national or entity,” the judges wrote. “They cannot be blocked under IEEPA, and OFAC overstepped its congressionally defined authority.” The post Hydra Founder Sentenced to Life in Prison by Russian Court for Running $5 Billion Crypto Black Market appeared first on Cryptonews .",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/hydra-founder-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-by-russian-court-for-running-5-billion-crypto-black-market/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37203302.jpeg

However, potential users should consider both the advantages and disadvantages of the platform before diving in. What makes ByBit attractive and what should traders beware of? Focusing on the main features, this article explores the key elements of ByBit that pique traders’ interest. Keep reading to find out the truth about ByBit’s offerings and the financial expert’s opinions. ByBit: Key Information and Features Traders Union announces that ByBit, originally registered in the British Virgin Islands, moved its headquarters to Singapore before relocating to Dubai in January 2023 due to regulatory restrictions in Singapore. ByBit is a major player in the crypto derivatives market, offering leverage of up to 100X on Bitcoin and up to 50X on other supported cryptocurrencies. The platform caters to traders, providing a testnet feature for risk-free demo trading with virtual funds. Additionally, ByBit supports over 300 crypto assets and offers free deposits, though small fees apply to withdrawals. ByBit Pros and Cons Overview ByBit offers notable advantages for traders, including high leverage options—up to 100x on Bitcoin and 50x on other cryptocurrencies. Its platform is user-friendly, featuring advanced trading tools, fast transaction speeds, and 99.9% uptime. ByBit also ensures security with multiple layers of authentication and provides a risk-free testnet for demo trading with virtual funds. Traders benefit from 24/7 customer support and a rewarding affiliate program. However, ByBit has a few downsides. It lacks stringent ID verification through KYC policies and doesn’t support fiat deposits or withdrawals, limiting options to credit and debit card purchases of crypto. Additionally, its spot trading pairs remain limited, though this feature is relatively new to the platform. Opening Bybit Demo Account To open a Bybit demo account, first visit the Bybit testnet website, which operates separately from the main platform. On the left, you’ll see the registration box, or you can click “Sign Up” in the top-right corner of other pages like the Home page. Enter your email, create a strong password, and add a referral code if available. After agreeing to the terms and conditions, confirm the details and click “Continue.” A verification code will be sent to your email; enter it to complete the process. Once verified, you’ll have full access to your demo account. Trading on the Bybit Demo Account To start trading on a Bybit demo account, you’ll need to add virtual BTC to your testnet account. Begin by logging into your live account, then switch over to the testnet platform. Contact customer support, have your UID ready, and request 10,000 USDT and 1 BTC in virtual funds. Once your demo account is “funded,” navigate to the “Trade” tab, choose your trading pair (e.g., BTC/USD), and specify the number of contracts to trade. Select “BUY” or “SELL” depending on your position, and your order will appear in the order book. Expert Opinion Financial expert Andrey Mastykin provides a detailed analysis of ByBit’s features, explaining why it has garnered a positive reputation among traders. “ByBit allows users to leverage their trades up to 100X on Bitcoin and 50X on other cryptocurrencies, making it an attractive option for those looking to maximize their profit potential in a volatile market,” he states. He emphasizes the platform’s demo account feature, stating, “The ByBit demo account is crucial for new traders. It allows them to practice trading with virtual funds without risking real money. This feature not only helps beginners learn the platform but also enables experienced traders to test new strategies.” Mastykin also points out the platform’s operational advantages. “ByBit boasts fast transaction speeds and a strong uptime of 99.9%, ensuring that traders can execute their orders quickly and efficiently,” he adds. “Additionally, 24/7 customer support in multiple languages provides users with immediate assistance whenever needed.” On the downside, Mastykin highlights a couple of significant concerns. “ByBit’s lack of stringent ID verification and KYC policies may raise issues for traders concerned about security and regulatory compliance,” he notes. “Furthermore, the platform does not support fiat currency deposits or withdrawals, limiting options for users who prefer traditional payment methods.” Mastykin concludes, “Despite its limitations, ByBit’s high leverage options, user-friendly interface, and demo trading capabilities contribute to its growing popularity among traders looking for a competitive edge in the cryptocurrency market.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,,0,0,Bitcoin World,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bybit-india-uncovered-the-shocking-truth-about-its-features-and-why-traders-are-raving/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png

In just a short time, it’s gone from a concept to a serious contender in the world of finance. But what’s truly exciting right now are two key features that could take XRPL to the next level: its Automated Market Maker (AMM) and the RLUSD stablecoin. In a recent post, crypto expert Max Avery presents some interesting facts to explain ‘how the XRPL’s AMM and RLUSD are set to make a dent in the universe.’ Time to do a fact check! Ready? Speed and Reliability: The XRPL Advantage Avery points out that XRPL can complete transactions in just 3 to 5 seconds, making it an exceptionally fast platform. But speed is not its only strength. With an impressive “zero downtime over a decade,” XRPL has proven its reliability. Avery also highlights the ecosystem’s carbon-neutral infrastructure, showing its commitment to sustainability. AMM: A New Era in Trading XRPL’s AMM feature is changing the way trades are executed. The traditional order book system has been replaced by a more efficient liquidity pool system, which simplifies the trading process. Avery also discusses the platform’s unique auction mode feature, designed to optimize arbitrage opportunities and improve overall trading efficiency. RLUSD: A Stablecoin with Big Potential RLUSD is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, designed for stability and transparency. Avery emphasizes how RLUSD can enhance liquidity, reduce slippage, and increase trading efficiency.

This decline coincides with the ongoing bull market, which has pushed the digital asset’s price closer to the $100,000 mark. This significant decline could have major implications for the asset’s supply-demand dynamics. Investor Confidence Increasing In Bitcoin? During a bull market, Bitcoin reserves on exchanges increase as long-term holders (LTH) and short-term holders (STH) transfer their holdings to trading platforms to take profits. However, the current bull market is breaking this trend, as BTC exchange reserves dwindle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Set To Hit $140,000 Target In December – Here’s Why Data from Cryptoquant indicates that over 171,000 BTC have been withdrawn from crypto exchanges since pro-crypto Republican candidate Donald Trump won the November US presidential election. The high amount of BTC being withdrawn from exchanges suggests that holders are likely moving their holdings to cold wallets, signaling long-term confidence in BTC. According to the chart below, BTC exchange reserves witnessed a sharp decline starting in November 2022 – falling from 3.33 million BTC on November 5, to 2.93 million BTC on December 21. Another notable drop began in February 2024, likely in anticipation of the Bitcoin halving in April and the ensuing supply scarcity of the digitally-programmed asset. During this period, reserves decreased from 3.05 million BTC to 2.63 million BTC by October 30 – a decline of 13.77% over eight months. Exchange reserves stand at just 2.46 million BTC, the lowest level in years. This ongoing decline hints at a potential supply crunch for Bitcoin, which could propel its price upward in the coming months. BTC Illiquid Supply Continues To Grow Another data point that supports the long-term holding hypothesis for BTC is Glassnode’s illiquid supply metric. The chart shared below shows that the digital asset’s illiquid supply has grown by 185,000 BTC in the past 30 days. Notably, the illiquid supply now accounts for approximately 14.8 million BTC, representing nearly three-fourths of the current circulating supply of 19.8 million BTC. If this trend continues, Bitcoin’s price could experience a significant surge due to supply scarcity. However, this could also introduce heightened volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Resets Open Interest, Targets $100,000 After Holding Key Support – Details While the decline in exchange reserves and rising illiquid supply are long-term bullish indicators for Bitcoin, short-term price movements could see a brief correction. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, BTC has formed a head-and-shoulder pattern on the hourly chart, which may trigger a sell-off that can push the asset’s price to $90,000. That said, another seasoned crypto analyst, Rekt Capital, said that after briefly touching the $98,000 price level, BTC has already entered the parabolic phase of the rally. BTC trades at $94,968 at press time, down 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

Will Polymarket take it too far?","The escalating situation in South Korea has once again proven why Polymarket sets itself aside in the odd pricing business and why the US government tried to intimidate its creator. For context, Polymarket accurately predicted the escalation of political turmoil brewing in South Korea after President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law out of nowhere. The predictions market also gave people on the outside an early hint of where the heads of people were during the chaos. However, not enough were paying attention. Although, it might have something to do with mainstream media running circles around the happenings as usual, barely able to make sense of the chaos and thus, unable to properly inform the outside world of what was happening and why. What’s happening in South Korea? Chaos reigned as President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law in his country on December 3, 2024. In defense of his decision, he alleged that opposition lawmakers and North Korea had teamed up against him to paralyze the government. It was the first time martial law had been declared in the country in over four decades. There was immediate backlash, with the opposition tagging it unconstitutional and the National Assembly voting unanimously to annul it. Despite the vote, the Ministry of Defense remained adamant, insisting on martial law enforcement until the president rescinded it hours later and only under intense pressure. While the drama unfolded, the world would have been left behind in confusion but for Polymarket. The platform kept updating odds across different markets, including that the president would remove the martial law order and impeachment wagers. Of course, this was in response to the Democratic Party’s threat to accuse the president of treason and impeach him. As it stands, Polymarket predicts a 65% chance of the president getting impeached, odds that have been steadily rising since noon of December 3. Does Polymarket pose any real danger? Polymarket’s ability to analyze events and accurately present wager markets makes it stand out. However, many have expressed reservations about how it does it. For example, Chainlink’s Zach Rynes cited concerns about the potential for prediction markets like Polymarket to, in the future, incentivize harmful actions, particularly regarding assassination bets and market manipulation. Vitalik Buterin, a respected voice in the crypto community, defended Polymarket when it faced criticism for its markets based on conflicts in the Middle East. He claimed that he draws the line when a market acts as a primary incentive for harmful actions, promoting insider trading. Rynes is unconvinced and has highlighted that any prediction market on influenceable events could incentivize harmful actions if there is enough liquidity available. “Even if it wasn’t the original intention, highly liquid markets could subsidize war,” Rynes argued. “Prediction markets aren’t passive observers—they can influence outcomes when they scale.” In response, Buterin proposed introducing soft caps on market sizes for platforms like Polymarket. His suggestion was to implement a fee structure that increases as market size approaches the cap, with all proceeds used to support socially beneficial markets with low organic volume. The Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has also defended the inclusion of a Hezbollah betting section on Polymarket. In a post from October 1 on X, Buterin highlighted how many individuals, including elites, make harmful and inaccurate predictions about conflicts on platforms like Twitter. He believes knowing whether people with a financial stake believe an event has a 2% or 50% chance of happening offers valuable insight that can help maintain rationality in the face of misinformation. “It’s not about ‘[making] money from bad stuff happening,’” he said. “It’s about creating an environment where speech has consequences (so both unjustified fearmongering and unjustified complacency are punished), without relying on governmental or corporate censors.” Polymarket’s Hezbollah-related markets allowed users to bet on significantly consequential real-life events like ceasefires and US military intervention in the Israel-Lebanon crisis. These markets have drawn in over $7 million in trading volume. Many are now asking about the ethical implications of Polymarket allowing people to bet on such events. The answer is very subjective. However, one thing is clear: Polymarket has changed how the world approaches events with global implications. Will it grow powerful enough to encourage insider trading and manipulation? Only time will tell. But given the human propensity to corrupt things, it is very likely Polymarket will be used for nefarious purposes — they just have to figure it out first. For now, real-life consequences aside, Polymarket has once again shown its ability to finger the pulse of events correctly, no matter how trivial. If South Korea’s president ends up on the impeachment block, it would be another notch on Polymarket’s hat — calling the impeachment way earlier than most.

Donald vs Israel (DONISRA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONISRA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Donald vs Israel can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald vs Israel could become the next viral memecoin. Donald vs Israel launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Donald vs Israel on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald vs Israel by entering its contract address – CKYA6Q1KcWsSJyXgFKwyNXyTAjHD1dRPKTDD2FTUFryn – in the receiving field.

37203301,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315968,1733295649,"‘Bitcoin Jesus’ Roger Ver Fights Tax Case, Claims Violation of Constitutional Rights","Lawyers for “Bitcoin Jesus” Roger Ver on Tuesday urged a US judge to dismiss his tax evasion indictment . This was his first court filing since being arrested in Spain in April. Earlier this year, US prosecutors charged Ver with major tax offenses . They claimed he avoided paying over $48m in taxes after selling crypto worth $240m. The case stems from Ver renouncing his US citizenship in 2014 and allegedly failing to file the required “exit tax” return. This tax aims to ensure individuals fulfill any outstanding obligations before leaving the US tax system. Ver’s legal issues deepened after his arrest in Spain, where he remains as a judge reviews his extradition to the US. He earned the nickname “Bitcoin Jesus” for his early role in promoting Bitcoin and his strong advocacy for the cryptocurrency. Roger Ver’s Defense Calls Exit Tax Vague, Claims IRS Loss Allegations Lack Merit On Tuesday, Ver’s lawyers argued in Los Angeles federal court that the IRS’s exit tax for US expatriates with assets exceeding $2m is unconstitutional and vague. They also accused prosecutors of improperly questioning one of Ver’s lawyers and ignoring documents showing Ver had no intent to break the law. “The only potential government interest is raising revenue, and there are innumerable less restrictive means through which revenue can be raised,” they said. Prosecutors have alleged that Ver caused the IRS a loss of at least $48m. Prosecutors Claim Ver Hid Bitcoin Data on Exit Tax Return They claim he intentionally concealed the true amount of Bitcoin he owned personally and through his California-based companies, MemoryDealers and Agilestar. According to the indictment, Ver’s companies held about 70,000 Bitcoin by June 2017. In Nov. 2017, he allegedly took control of these and sold tens of thousands, earning around $240m. Further, Ver allegedly worked with a firm and appraisers for his exit tax obligations but provided inaccurate data about his Bitcoin holdings. As a result, his 2017 exit tax return omitted his personal Bitcoin ownership and undervalued his companies. But, Ver’s legal team argued that prosecutors ignored evidence showing he had no intent to violate US tax laws. If convicted on all charges, Ver could face significant prison time. He may receive up to 20 years for each mail fraud count. For each tax evasion count, he could face up to five years. Additionally, he may get up to three years for each false tax return count.

37199751,https://coinpedia.org/?p=388979,1733295559,December’s Crypto Spotlight: Is This the Moment a New Bitcoin-Level Blockchain is Poised to Take Over?,"The post December’s Crypto Spotlight: Is This the Moment a New Bitcoin-Level Blockchain is Poised to Take Over? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The world of cryptocurrency thrives on innovation and disruption, with each year bringing new projects that push the boundaries of possibility. As December 2024 unfolds, whispers of a blockchain contender reaching “Bitcoin-level” significance are captivating investors, developers, and enthusiasts alike. Could this be the moment when a new blockchain project rises to claim its place as a transformative force in the industry? Lightchain Protocol AI Presale Let’s explore why this project has become the crypto world’s spotlight and what it could mean for the future. The Legacy of Bitcoin: A Benchmark for Greatness Bitcoin has long stood as the cornerstone of the cryptocurrency world. As the first decentralized digital currency, it introduced the world to the concept of trustless transactions and financial sovereignty. Its scarcity, resilience, and wide adoption have solidified its position as digital gold. However, Bitcoin’s limitations have become increasingly apparent: Energy Consumption: The Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism requires vast amounts of energy, raising environmental concerns. Scalability Issues: Bitcoin’s low transaction throughput makes it impractical for everyday use at scale. Limited Use Cases: While a strong store of value, Bitcoin lacks the flexibility for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Lightchain Protocol AI Presale These challenges have set the stage for a new blockchain to emerge with the potential to redefine what’s possible in the space. The New Contender: A Bitcoin-Level Disruptor? Although specifics remain under wraps, industry insiders suggest that this new blockchain project is designed to address the challenges Bitcoin faces while building on its foundational principles. Here’s what sets it apart: 1. Advanced Consensus Mechanism This blockchain reportedly introduces an innovative consensus algorithm—possibly called Proof of Intelligence (PoI)—that rewards meaningful computational contributions rather than relying on energy-intensive mining or staking. This mechanism could achieve both scalability and sustainability, making it a standout solution. 2. AI-Driven Ecosystem The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into its infrastructure is what truly differentiates this platform. By incorporating an Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), it enables dApps that are smarter, faster, and capable of real-time decision-making. Lightchain Protocol AI Presale 3. Seamless Scalability Unlike Bitcoin and even Ethereum, this project promises scalability as a native feature, eliminating the need for Layer 2 solutions. This means faster transactions at lower costs, even under heavy network demand. 4. Environmental Sustainability With energy efficiency as a core design principle, this blockchain aligns with the growing demand for greener technologies, making it a viable choice for environmentally conscious users and enterprises. Why December 2024 Is a Pivotal Moment The timing of this project’s emergence is key. With the crypto market entering a new phase of maturity, projects that combine innovation with practical solutions are gaining traction. December’s buzz around this blockchain challenger suggests it could be poised to take advantage of: Institutional Interest: As traditional institutions explore blockchain applications, they are likely to gravitate toward platforms that are scalable, sustainable, and secure. Mainstream Adoption: Features like user-friendly design and low transaction fees could attract non-technical users and small businesses. Market Evolution: The crypto community is increasingly looking for platforms that go beyond financial applications to solve real-world problems. The Ripple Effect on the Crypto Industry If this blockchain delivers on its promises, its impact could be far-reaching: Challenging Bitcoin’s Dominance: While Bitcoin’s position as digital gold is secure, this new project could rival its significance by offering broader utility and a more sustainable infrastructure. Transforming Decentralized Applications: Developers could create a new generation of intelligent, scalable dApps powered by AI. Driving Mass Adoption: By addressing user needs for speed, efficiency, and eco-friendliness, this blockchain could bring cryptocurrencies into the daily lives of millions. Final Thoughts: A Blockchain Worth Watching December 2024 could mark a turning point in the blockchain industry.

EGRAG predicts that the $2 level could now become a new macro support, replacing the previous $0.50 support level. This would mean that XRP has established a solid foundation for further growth, with the bulls likely to defend against any major pullbacks. EGRAG also hinted at a potential historic yearly candle close for XRP in 2024. With the token already up 313% this year, the analyst expects more upward momentum in December, driven by strong market sentiment. Analysts See Long-Term Potential Aligning with the EGRAG analysis Veteran market expert Raoul Pal even shared his bullish perspective on XRP, despite being a previous skeptic. He noted that XRP’s price chart is showcasing a massive wedge pattern that mirrors the structure seen before the 2017 bull run. You've got to admit, $XRP is a good looking chart.

PEPE whale net flow | Source: IntoTheBlock This momentum from Pepe investors could trigger FOMO (fear of missing out) among retail holders.

You might also like: Here’s why crypto prices had a brief flash crash in South Korea One of the largest spikes in the Pepe whale net inflow happened on Nov. 14 as large holders accumulated 4.7 trillion PEPE coins as its price reached $0.000023, per data from ITB. The price of the meme coin has been consolidating below that mark since then. On the other hand, midterm and long-term PEPE holders have been declining over the last month. Addresses holding the meme coin for over a year fell from 91,200 on Nov. 11 to 89,000 on Dec. 3, per ITB data. Cruisers, holding PEPE between one and 12 months, plunged from 200,000 on Nov. 8 to roughly 89,000 yesterday. However, PEPE traders, with a keeping time of less than a month, increased by 262% over the last 30 days, reaching 72,000 unique addresses. Pepe has been consolidating close to $0.000020 over the past day with a market cap of $8.69 billion. Its 24-hour trading volume declined by 1% to $3.48 billion. At this point, PEPE’s bullish momentum is very likely to face a blockage from short-term traders unless another wave of strong whale accumulation surfaces.

Responding to a parliamentary question regarding tax compliance by cryptocurrency exchanges, Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary revealed that the total GST evasion by these entities amounted to ₹824.14 crore ($96 million), with a Binance group company contributing the majority share. According to the ministry, 47 Virtual Digital Asset Service Providers have registered as reporting entities under the Financial Intelligence Unit, out of which 17 entities were investigated for GST evasion. Nest Services Limited, a Binance Group company based in Seychelles, evaded GST amounting to inr 722.43 crore (roughly $85 million), making it the largest contributor to the total evasion identified by the Indian Finance Ministry. The next biggest GST evader was WazirX, operated by Zanmai Labs Pvt. Ltd., which was found to have evaded ₹40.51 crore. The platform was hacked in July and lost $235 million worth of funds.

In contrast, no recovery has been made so far from the Binance-linked entity despite its significantly larger evasion amount. The GST is a nationwide indirect tax applied to the manufacture, sale, and consumption of goods and services. Foreign entities providing services in India are required to register under the GST framework and comply with tax obligations. As previously reported by crypto.news, the Directorate General of GST Intelligence of Ahmedabad sent a show-cause letter to Nest Services in August after it found that the fees collected from Binance’s operations were deposited in accounts controlled by the company. The DGGI alleged that Binance earned at least 4,000 crores, approximately $476 million, from transaction fees before it was asked to halt services and complete registration. Binance complied and became a registered reporting entity under the Financial Intelligence Unit in August after paying a $2.25 million fine for operating without a license. To address the tax evasion issue, Binance has reportedly appointed a representative to liaise with the agency.

It’s a DeFi-focused trilogy— Polkadot is leading interoperability again with its famed Polkado t 2.0 Uograde, and Toncoin is rising from the ashes of its Telegram dilemma. At the same time, Rollblock is shaking up the iGaming world with its GambleFi protocol. Together, these utility tokens are setting the stage for December’s most exciting crypto narratives, blending innovation, growth potential, and investor appeal. Rollblock: DeFi meets iGaming turns RBLK into the new breakout star The crypto market is shifting, and utility token s like Rollblock are leading the way. This top crypto casino’s unique blend of DeFi and iGaming is redefining the space. With its token soaring over 300% to $0.037 in its ongoing presale, which has already raised $6.6 million, it’s clear that this project has struck a chord with investors. Rollblock is more than just another gambling platform. By leveraging blockchain’s transparency and efficiency, it offers over 7,000 gaming options while ensuring provably fair play. However, gaming is only the surface. The real innovation lies in Rollblock’s revenue-sharing model and staking opportunities, which set it apart from competitors. Industry analysts are hailing Rollblock as a potential turning point for DeFi. After years of failed experiments, this project bridges the gap between mainstream appeal and crypto utility. With its presale’s resounding success, Rollblock is proving that DeFi can thrive with the right mix of innovation, transparency, and profitability. Polkadot: Interoperable metaprotocol utility token DeFi redefining upgrade Polkadot has emerged as a game-changer with its DeFi, redefining groundbreaking metaprotocol technology. Designed to connect specialized blockchains in a seamless, interoperable ecosystem, Polkadot is laying the foundation for the decentralized internet—Web3. As we approach 2025, the buzz around Polkadot as top crypto is louder than ever. The anticipated Polkadot 2.0 upgrade, slated for Q1 2025, promises to address scalability challenges with features like Async Backing and Elastic Scaling. Developers and investors are already taking note: DOT’s price has surged over 100% in the past month, reaching a new $10.2 high. Polkadot ’s role in stablecoin adoption further underscores its value. Toncoin surges to new highs as TON recovers from Telegram dilemma Another utility token that is capturing the spotlight as one of the most promising top crypto s is Toncoin . Born from the visionary technology initially developed by Telegram, TON has overcome past legal challenges to emerge stronger than ever. Today, its mission is clear: revolutionize Web3 by empowering millions to control their digital identity and assets. Currently trading at $6.94, Toncoin is eyeing a crucial breakout above the $7 resistance level—a threshold that could propel it into double-digit territory. Key metrics support this bullish outlook: 72% of Toncoin addresses are in profit, and whale activity has surged 110% in just 24 hours. Analysts are optimistic, highlighting Toncoin ’s positive 90-day returns and rising Open Interest as precursors to significant price movements. Conclusion December is unfolding with so much potential. Toncoin , Polkadot, and Rollblock are proving why utility token s dominate the spotlight in today’s crypto landscape. From Polkadot ’s game-changing interoperability and Toncoin ’s triumphant resurgence to Rollblock’s innovative GambleFi protocol, these projects are not just setting trends—they’re redefining what’s possible in DeFi and beyond.

Let me explain in simple terms what this means and why $XRP will witness a hyper galactic pump if this were true. Thread below — Luke Thomas (@DEarthshaker) December 2, 2024 Current XRP Escrow Dynamics Ripple currently holds approximately 38 billion XRP in escrow, locked until April 2027. Each month, one billion XRP is unlocked , with the company typically locking about 80% back into escrow while selling the remaining 20% on the secondary market. In 2024 alone, Ripple sold 3 billion XRP, generating approximately $3.46 billion. The escrow mechanism ensures that Ripple’s large holdings do not flood the market, maintaining relative price stability for XRP. Proposal: Using Escrow XRP for RLUSD Reserve The proposal outlined by Thomas involves Ripple dedicating 30 billion XRP from the escrow as a reserve for RLUSD, which would serve as a new stable digital asset. Key components of the concept include: Establishment of a Reserve : Ripple would lock 30 billion XRP into a smart contract or similar mechanism, immobilizing the tokens as collateral. This would ensure the XRP could not be traded or liquidated, maintaining the reserve’s integrity. Creation of RLUSD : RLUSD would be minted as a stablecoin-like asset, with its value pegged to the USD (e.g., 1 RLUSD = 1 USD). The locked XRP reserve would back this peg, providing stability and trust for RLUSD users. Distribution and Utilization : Ripple could distribute RLUSD to its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) partners, such as banks and payment providers, for cross-border transactions. This would promote faster and more cost-effective transfers across the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Enhanced Working Capital for Ripple : By selling RLUSD to institutional partners, Ripple would receive fiat or other assets, bolstering its working capital. These funds could be utilized for operational expansion and innovative projects. Potential Impacts on XRP and the XRPL The implementation of such a strategy could bring several benefits: Reduced XRP Supply : Locking 30 billion XRP would reduce its circulating supply, potentially driving up demand and market value. Increased XRPL Liquidity : As ODL partners actively utilize RLUSD, demand for XRP’s ecosystem could grow, bolstering the utility of the XRPL. Market Confidence : Establishing RLUSD as a collateral-backed asset would reinforce Ripple’s credibility and provide a strong use case for XRP in the financial ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple as a Trillion Dollar Company Thomas speculates that this approach could position Ripple as a trillion-dollar company by 2027 or 2028. He envisions a future where regulatory clarity fosters widespread cryptocurrency adoption, with traditional banks offering custodial, trading, and staking services. This environment could drive new demographic groups, such as Gen X and Baby Boomers, into the cryptocurrency market via investment vehicles like ETFs . Ripple’s potential RLUSD initiative exemplifies the innovative applications of blockchain technology and digital assets. If this speculation proves accurate, it could mark a transformative chapter for XRP and Ripple, reinforcing their roles in the evolving global financial landscape.

Qubetics Is Your Best Chance to Make it Big as a Millionaire,"The crypto market never stays quiet for long, does it? Between surging coins, new blockchain innovations, and meme coins making their million-dollar rounds, there’s always something brewing. Lately, the buzz has been about projects with real-world utility—those that don’t just ride the hype train but actually change how we live, work, and invest. Cardano (ADA), a heavyweight in the crypto world, proved its potential when it went from a modest ICO price of $0.0024 to its current $1.30. That’s a mind-boggling 50,000% ROI! But here’s the kicker: not everyone caught that rocket ship. If you also regret missing out on ADA’s ICO gains, don’t worry—because the next big thing is already here. Say hello to Qubetics ($TICS) , the best crypto poised to give early investors a shot at unimaginable returns. So, what makes Qubetics the next big play? It’s not just about its killer ROI predictions; it’s about solving real-world problems with tech that’s way ahead of its predecessors. While Cardano laid the groundwork for a scalable blockchain ecosystem, Qubetics is taking things a step further with its multi-chain wallet and all-in-one Web3 aggregator. Let’s break it down. Qubetics: The Best Crypto for Real-World Solutions and Insane ROI Potential Qubetics ($TICS) , the blockchain project that’s making waves for all the right reasons. It’s not just another token; it’s an entire ecosystem designed to tackle the inefficiencies that have plagued blockchain adoption. And its centerpiece? The multi-chain wallet—a game-changer for anyone who’s ever juggled wallets, conversions, and confusing interfaces. Imagine you’re a small business owner running an online store. Managing payments in different cryptocurrencies is a nightmare, right? With Qubetics’ wallet, you can seamlessly accept payments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or even $TICS—all without worrying about gas fees, thanks to gasless $TICS transactions. Or maybe you’re a freelance graphic designer working with international clients. Instead of waiting days for a bank transfer, you get paid instantly in crypto and can convert it to your preferred fiat currency in a few clicks. Easy, right? Now, think about how this transforms industries. Retailers can simplify cross-border payments. Gamers can seamlessly buy in-game assets. Travellers can pay for hotels without currency exchange headaches. This is why Qubetics is being hailed as the best crypto for real-world utility. It’s not just an investment; it’s a solution. Qubetics is currently in its 11th presale stage , with over 261 million tokens sold to 5,900 holders, raising a whopping $4.2 million. The current price? Just $0.0282 per $TICS. But heads up—it’s going up by 10% this weekend, hitting $0.0311. And the ROI predictions? Absolutely mind-blowing! By the end of the presale, $TICS is expected to hit $0.25, delivering a staggering 783% ROI. But that’s just the beginning—if $TICS climbs to $15 post-mainnet launch as analysts predict, early investors could see an astronomical ROI of over 52,000%. Now, isn’t that the kind of opportunity you’ve been waiting for? What does this mean in dollar terms? If you invest $20,000 today, that could turn into $10.6M if $TICS hits $15. That’s the kind of return that turns heads—and changes lives. Cardano: From ICO Underdog to Blockchain Juggernaut When Cardano launched its ICO in 2017, you probably didn’t think much of it. After all, $0.0024 per token felt like just another cheap coin with lofty promises. Fast forward to today, and ADA is trading at $1.30, making waves as one of the most trusted and scalable blockchain platforms. Its Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism and focus on interoperability have turned it into a go-to choice for developers and institutions. It’s not flashy, but it’s solid—a steady turtle in a race full of hares. In the last year alone, Cardano has rolled out several updates, including its Hydra Layer 2 solution for lightning-fast transactions and greater scalability. It’s a far cry from the days of clunky, overcrowded networks that couldn’t handle the heat. Analysts predict ADA could hit $2.50 by mid-2025, making it a “safe bet” in the crypto world. But here’s the thing: Cardano’s glory days as a moonshot investment are behind it. Getting in now might net you solid returns, but the life-changing 50,000% ROI? Those opportunities are rare. If you’re hunting for the best crypto to buy now and ride the wave to wealth, Cardano may not scratch that itch. Missed Cardano? Don’t Miss Qubetics! Here’s the bottom line: Cardano paved the way, but Qubetics is blazing a new trail. Where Cardano focused on scalability and academic rigour, Qubetics is all about accessibility, interoperability, and solving everyday problems. It’s not just a coin; it’s a toolkit for the Web3 era. So, if you’re sitting there thinking, “Why didn’t I jump on Cardano at $0.0024?” don’t let history repeat itself. The best crypto to get rich now isn’t ADA—it’s $TICS. And with the presale still in full swing, there’s no better time to dive in. Don’t wait until you’re reading about Qubetics’ meteoric rise in hindsight. This is your moment. Head over to Qubetics’ presale page and grab your $TICS tokens before the price hike this weekend. Don’t let this one slip through your fingers. The best crypto to get rich isn’t just a dream—it’s Qubetics.

37203300,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315957,1733292684,South Korea Hits Record $34 Billion Trade Volume as President Declares Martial Law,"South Korea witnessed a record $34.2 billion in cryptocurrency trading volume over 24 hours following a brief declaration of emergency martial law by President Yoon Suk-yeol. The unusual trade activity unfolded across the country’s major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax, according to CoinMarketCap data. Leading the surge was Upbit, South Korea’s largest exchange, which processed $27.25 billion alone. Trade Volume across South Korean Exchanges Double The overall volume nearly doubled the $18 billion recorded just a day prior, a figure that had already made headlines for eclipsing the daily turnover of the local stock market. Notably, this marked the highest single-day trading volume of the year, as reported by local crypto outlet Digital Asset . The spike in trading activity came amid political turmoil. Late Tuesday night, President Yoon declared martial law, citing threats to democracy from “anti-state” forces allegedly tied to the opposition left-wing party. The emergency measures, which lasted six hours, triggered panic among South Korean traders, leading to widespread sell-offs on local exchanges. Bitcoin’s price on Upbit dropped to 88 million won ($62,182) at one point, as reported by News1 . Other cryptocurrencies also experienced significant price declines, while exchanges grappled with service outages due to the surge in activity. By early Wednesday morning, lawmakers convened an emergency session, unanimously voting to overturn the martial law order. President Yoon subsequently rescinded the directive.

The opposition party announced plans to file treason charges against Yoon, along with the Ministers of Defense and Interior, and is pushing for their impeachment. Meanwhile, on decentralized prediction platform Polymarket, speculation about President Yoon’s political future intensified. The odds of a $500,000 bet on his early departure from office surged to 78% before stabilizing at 47%. If Yoon completes his term, it is set to end in May 2027. South Koreans Turn to Crypto A recent survey has revealed that most young South Koreans are losing faith in the national pension system , with many stating they see crypto and stocks as a better alternative. The study found that more than three-quarters of people aged 20-39 “don’t trust” state-issued pensions. Over half of respondents who said they were making their own pension plans claimed they were building their retirement funds with stocks and crypto. Interestingly, even election candidates themselves have exposure to cryptocurrencies , with approximately 7% of them owning digital assets, according to a report by Yonhap that analyzed their asset disclosures. Just recently, it was reported that South Korea is set to introduce stricter regulations for token listing on exchanges, including the blocking of tokens that have been hacked. As reported, South Korea has once again postponed the implementation of its 20% tax on cryptocurrency gains, marking the third delay since the tax was first proposed in 2021. The latest decision, announced earlier this month, will push the tax implementation to 2025, following an agreement between the Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) and the ruling People Power Party (PPP) during budget negotiations.

Solana’s memecoin market cap has scaled to over $20 billion and a daily average traded volume of over $8 billion, led by dogwifhat (WIF), and Bonk (BONK), among others. The notable rise of Solana’s memecoin industry has heavily been impacted by the Pumpfun launchpad.

Key Metrics for Pumpfun Protocol According to market data provided by Dune analytics, around 40,206 tokens were launched on Pumpfun Protocol in the past 24 hours. However, only 521 tokens were generated in the past 24 hours, thus raising the total tokens launched on Pumpfun to over 4.2 million. On Tuesday, Pumpfun Protocol registered a net revenue of about $3.1 million, thus bringing the total revenue to over $278 million. The protocol’s revenue has, however, been on the decline in the past week following the disabling of the live stream feature, which was marred with huge controversy.

While Korean investors have contributed to XRP's impressive 30-day price surge of over 400% to $2.60, they're not the only game in town. The stateside investors have been hyperactive through the Nasdaq-listed Coinbase exchange.  The XRP/USD pair on Coinbase has been consistently pricier than Binance's XRP/USDT pair in the past 30 days, with minute-level premiums ranging from 3% to 13%, according to data from analytics firm CryptoQuant.  It's a sign of whales being active on Coinbase, according to CryptoQuant's CEO Ki Young Ju. In the meantime, prices have not seen a significant premium on Upbit, South Korea's leading cryptocurrency exchange.  Narratives surrounding crypto adoption under Trump's presidency are likely powering the so-called Coinbase premium.  ""The WSJ describes Trump's second term as 'new era for crypto—with fewer government hurdles.' Under a 'litigation peace,' according to the asset's proponents, XRP will become more accessible to major financial institutions using the asset as a 'bridge currency' for foreign exchange,"" FRNT Financial said in the newsletter Tuesday, explaining the XRP rally and booming activity in the U.S. exchanges.  Trump's friendliness to crypto is bolstering the thesis that payments-focused XRP will become ""ubiquitous in international capital flows as a ‘bridge currency’ when settling foreign exchange,"" FRNT added.  Coinbase lags in trading volume  Volume trends, however, indicate Korean leadership in the XRP market. On Upbit, XRP/KRW is the most traded pair of the past 24 hours, with a volume of $7.63 billion, equating to 26% of the total activity, according to data source Coingecko.  On Coinbase, the XRP/USD pair has seen a trading volume of nearly $1.7 billion in the past 24 hours, the highest among all pairs, accounting for over 17% of the exchange's total turnover of $9.89 billion, according to data source Coingecko. The BTC/USD is the second-most actively traded pair, with a volume of $1.59 billion.  The offshore XRP market is bigger in volume, likely because the cryptocurrency was unavailable for trading in the U.S. for a long time because Ripple was locked in a legal battle with the SEC over alleged securities law violations for issuing XRP to institutions and retail investors. However, favorable resolution of the legal tussle early this year prompted exchanges, including Coinbase, to re-list XRP.",POSITIVE,XRP,ASIA | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/04/move-over-xrps-korea-narrative-the-400-price-rally-has-support-of-coinbase-whales,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0fdf7fd5e77baf9eb80e83ba157fa89e249c020e-1280x873.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Speaking at a keynote hosted by Crain's Chicago Business Editor-in-Chief Ann Dwyer, Goolsbee addressed the challenges and opportunities facing the U.S. economy and monetary policy. “We have very few tools. I told you we can only tighten or loosen,” Goolsbee explained. While monetary tightening helps combat inflation, he noted that raising interest rates too high risks unintended economic consequences. “The only way to create deflation for the economy as a whole is to crash it,” he said, drawing historical comparisons such as the Great Depression. Related News: Here's the Top 10 AI Altcoins Developers Have Focused on in the Last Month Goolsbee noted significant economic successes as he assessed progress in 2024. Inflation has been steadily declining, approaching the Fed’s 2% target. At the same time, the labor market remains flexible and sustainable full employment levels are becoming a reality. “We have reached sustainable full employment without overheating. I expect we can get there,” he said. As the Fed nears the end of 2024, Goolsbee expects a “reasonable amount” of rate cuts from current levels over the next year if economic conditions remain stable. However, he acknowledged the need for flexibility, noting that decisions are reviewed every six weeks based on evolving data. *This is not investment advice.

On Tuesday, the largest digital asset traded above the key $95,000 mark, acting as support for the past 24 hours. This reflects a remarkable surge of over 40% since Trump’s election victory on November 5. Could A National BTC Reserve Become Reality? Trump’s administration is expected to reverse the Biden administration’s stringent regulations on digital assets, which could significantly alter the landscape for cryptocurrencies in the US. The Republican party is already positioning crypto-friendly candidates to lead key regulatory bodies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Related Reading: XRP Q3 Overview: Key Metrics Suggest A Bright Future For The Third Biggest Crypto Additionally, discussions within Trump’s transition team have included the potential creation of a dedicated White House position focused on digital-asset policy. President-elect Trump has voiced ambitions to establish the US as the global hub for cryptocurrency, even proposing the concept of a national Bitcoin reserve. However, analysts express skepticism about the practicality of this idea. Jaret Seiberg from TD Cowen noted that while Trump may advocate for a Bitcoin reserve in public forums, it would require significant political capital to implement, especially given his firm stance on maintaining the US dollar’s status as the world’s primary currency. Crypto advocate Paul Atkins is considered a strong candidate to replace outgoing SEC chairman Gary Gensler. The current chair officially announced his resignation last week, effective January 20, the day of Trump’s inauguration. Gensler has played a key role in enforcing compliance in the digital asset space, especially after a tumultuous 2022 that saw a significant market downturn and significant financial losses for investors following the implosion of the once Sam Bankman-led FTX exchange. Political Instability In South Korea Drives Bitcoin Prices Below $72,000 Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, such as XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE), have experienced notable price discrepancies in South Korea due to local political instability. Following the imposition and subsequent rescinding of martial law by President Yoon Suk Yeol, Bitcoin’s price on South Korean exchanges dipped below $72,000 at one point, reflecting heightened risk aversion among investors. Related Reading: CryptoQuant CEO Warns Not To Short XRP Due To Insider Whale Activity However, the overall cryptocurrency market has seen a staggering increase since Trump was declared president-elect, with total market capitalization rising by approximately $1.3 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $95,840, posting slight losses of 0.2%, but halting the upward trend seen over the past few months. Over the past 8 hours, attention has shifted to altcoins such as BNB, which hit a new record high, and XRP, which is trading just 20% below its all-time high.

37198183,https://coinpedia.org/?p=388951,1733291931,Prices of Tron (TRX) & BinanceCoin (BNB) Just Hit A New ATH—Which Coin is Next?,"The post Prices of Tron (TRX) & BinanceCoin (BNB) Just Hit A New ATH—Which Coin is Next? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin price continues to juggle around the narrow range, paving the way for the other altcoins to grow. While the large-cap tokens are gaining more attention, the tokens within the top 10 have been performing exceptionally in the past few days. BinanceCoin (BNB), which usually scales up without making any noise, has just smashed new highs at $773.26, while Tron (TRX) demonstrated a monstrous rally of over 100% jump to surpass the 6-year-old high to reach $0.44. Now that the tokens have entered the discovery phase, the next course of action could be extremely bullish. BinanceCoin (BNB) Clears Path to $1000 The BNB Price has launched a massive bullish attack and is on the verge of demonstrating a 2021-like move soon. The technicals are mirroring the bull run pattern, suggesting the price could be due for a 100% rally to reach $1000 in a short while. However, the bearish activity is expected to rise, which could slow down the pace, but the bulls appear to be self-assured of pushing the price towards a 4-digit level. The BNB price broke above the final resistance wall around $700 and marked a 20% rise to reach new highs. However, the rally does not appear to stop here, as the technicals suggest the price has just started to rise. The MACD shows the rise in the buying pressure while remaining within the positive range. Besides, the RSI is about to enter the overbought zone, which could trigger a 100% move to reach a 4-digit figure in the first few weeks of 2025. Tron (TRX) Price Eyes to Reach $1 The Tron price surged gigantically by over 100% in just a few hours, pushing it towards a new ATH at $0.44. The prime reason is an increase in liquidity with a surge in Tether minting new USDT across Ethereum & Tron networks. As a result, the token’s trading volume surged over 500%, making it the 4th largest traded asset for the day after USDT, BTC, and ETH & XRP. The bulls appear to have gained huge strength, but the current trade setup suggests there could be some scope for a pullback. The price is testing the upper resistance of the rising wedge and if it breaks out, the price will surge to $0.7 and face a retracement to $0.5 followed by a rebound to $1. However, the monthly RSI has reached above 91, suggesting a relaxation phase may soon begin. This could keep the price consolidated within the wedge until it reaches the apex and later breakout beyond $1.",POSITIVE,TRX | BNB,ALTCOIN | MARKET | TRADING | TRX | BNB,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/prices-of-tron-trx-binancecoin-bnb-just-hit-a-new-ath-which-coin-is-next/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Giá Bitcoin đã giảm mạnh nhất kể từ sau cuộc bầu cử Mỹ, mất 8,64% giá trị trong tuần và xuống còn 90.911 Đô, nhưng sau đó đã nhanh chóng phục hồi và kết thúc tháng ở mức giá kỷ lục 96.506 Đô. Bitcoin đã tăng trưởng ấn tượng 37,3% trong tháng 11, trở thành tháng tăng trưởng tốt thứ hai từ đầu năm 2024 đến nay. Kết quả khả quan này cho thấy Bitcoin đang có đà tăng trưởng rất tốt và hứa hẹn sẽ tiếp tục tăng trưởng trong tháng 12. Lịch sử cho thấy tháng 12 thường là tháng biến động đối với Bitcoin, nhưng trong các năm halving , Bitcoin lại tăng trưởng trung bình tới 38,86%. Với tình hình thị trường tăng giá hiện tại, chúng tôi tin rằng Bitcoin sẽ tiếp tục tăng, mặc dù có thể có những biến động ngắn hạn. Các đợt giảm giá ngắn hạn có thể xảy ra do các quỹ ETF bán ra và nhà đầu tư dài hạn chốt lời. Tuần trước, các quỹ ETF đã bán ròng 135,1 triệu Đô Bitcoin, chủ yếu trong hai ngày giao dịch đầu tiên. Kể từ tháng 9, các nhà đầu tư dài hạn đã bán ra 508.990 Bitcoin, làm tăng lượng cung trên thị trường. Mặc dù con số này vẫn thấp hơn so với 934.000 Bitcoin được bán ra trước khi Bitcoin đạt đỉnh vào tháng 3 năm 2024, áp lực bán này vẫn đòi hỏi nhu cầu từ các quỹ ETF và người mua mới phải đủ lớn để tránh Bitcoin giảm giá. Một điểm đáng chú ý là lượng Bitcoin nắm giữ bởi các nhà đầu tư ngắn hạn đang gần đạt mức cao nhất trong chu kỳ là 3.282.000 BTC. Lịch sử cho thấy giai đoạn cuối của thị trường tăng giá thường bắt đầu khi lượng Bitcoin nắm giữ bởi nhà đầu tư ngắn hạn vượt qua mức cao nhất của chu kỳ trước đó. Điều này cho thấy sự tham gia ngày càng tăng của các nhà đầu tư nhỏ lẻ, nhưng đồng thời cũng cho thấy thị trường cần có thêm nhu cầu mới để hấp thụ lượng Bitcoin bán ra từ các nhà đầu tư dài hạn. Hiện tại, Bitcoin đang trong giai đoạn củng cố, điều này là cần thiết để thị trường hấp thụ lượng Bitcoin bán ra và điều chỉnh lại nhu cầu. Với dòng tiền từ các quỹ ETF quay trở lại và sự quan tâm ngày càng tăng từ các nhà đầu tư nhỏ lẻ, chúng tôi tin rằng Bitcoin sẽ sớm vượt qua mốc 100.000 Đô. Nền kinh tế Mỹ cũng cho thấy sự phục hồi vào cuối năm 2024, nhờ vào chi tiêu tiêu dùng tăng trưởng, thị trường lao động ổn định và kỳ vọng lạm phát trong tầm kiểm soát. Tuy nhiên, vẫn còn một số thách thức. Trong tháng 10, chi tiêu tiêu dùng tăng 0,4% cùng với thu nhập tăng 0,6%, trong khi lạm phát tăng nhẹ . Đầu tư kinh doanh có dấu hiệu trái chiều, đơn đặt hàng hàng hóa lâu bền tăng nhẹ và tăng trưởng GDP ổn định ở mức 2.8% trong quý 3. Niềm tin của người tiêu dùng trong tháng 11 đạt mức cao nhất trong 16 tháng , nhờ sự lạc quan vào thị trường lao động và kỳ vọng lạm phát giảm xuống 4,9%. Tuy nhiên, vẫn còn những lo ngại về lạm phát do các chính sách của chính quyền mới. Dù vậy, hoạt động tiêu dùng mạnh mẽ và thị trường lao động ổn định được kỳ vọng sẽ giúp kinh tế Mỹ tiếp tục tăng trưởng đến cuối năm. Tuần trước, có một số tin tức đáng chú ý trong lĩnh vực tiền điện tử. Hồng Kông thúc đẩy sự đổi mới trong tài chính kỹ thuật số, Celsius Network nỗ lực giải quyết phá sản và những thay đổi về quy định ở Nga là những tin tức nổi bật trong lĩnh vực tiền điện tử tuần trước, trong bối cảnh stablecoin cũng tiếp tục khẳng định vị thế. Cơ quan Tiền tệ Hồng Kông đã ra mắt Chương trình Trợ cấp Trái phiếu Kỹ thuật số, cung cấp các khoản trợ cấp lên tới 2,5 triệu đô Hồng Kông cho mỗi lần phát hành để thúc đẩy trái phiếu được mã hóa, củng cố vị thế của Hồng Kông như một trung tâm tài sản ảo. Trong khi đó, Celsius Network đã thực hiện khoản thanh toán 127 triệu Đô thứ hai cho các chủ nợ, thúc đẩy quá trình phá sản. Đồng thời, cựu Giám đốc điều hành của công ty này đang phải đối mặt với những thách thức pháp lý, nhấn mạnh sự phức tạp của trách nhiệm giải trình của doanh nghiệp trong lĩnh vực này. Tại Nga, luật mới công nhận tiền điện tử là tài sản và miễn trừ khai thác tiền điện tử khỏi thuế GTGT đánh dấu một bước tiến quan trọng trong việc làm rõ quy định, nhằm mục đích cân bằng tăng trưởng trên thị trường tài sản kỹ thuật số với thuế có cấu trúc và tuân thủ. Đồng thời, thị trường stablecoin đã đạt mức vốn hóa kỷ lục là 190 tỷ Đô, với USDt từ Tether chiếm 70% tổng số vốn hoá. Được thúc đẩy bởi hiệu quả thanh toán xuyên biên giới và việc áp dụng bởi các công ty tài chính truyền thống như Stripe và PayPal, stablecoin đang củng cố vai trò của mình trong tài chính chính thống. Những phát triển này làm nổi bật sự tương tác của đổi mới, quy định và động lực thị trường định hình ngành công nghiệp tiền điện tử. Và đó là bản tin tóm tắt từ Bitfinex Alpha 133.

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-pepe-sanpepe-solana-memecoin-to-rally-19000-ahead-of-first-exchange-listing-as-shib-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The TOTAL3, which excludes Bitcoin and Ethereum, rallied to a new all-time high (ATH) of about $1.14 trillion, thus signaling the onset of the much-anticipated altseason. In the past 24 hours, BNB price surged over 15 percent to reach a new ATH of about $771.60, before retracing to around $750 on Wednesday during the early Asian session. As a result, BNB’s price has broken out of the multi-year resistance range between $697 and $725, thus entering the much-anticipated discovery phase of the macro bull cycle. Growing Binance Ecosystem The Binance ecosystem has grown to a major web3 project, with dozens of DeFi projects. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $107 billion, registered a 100 percent surge in daily average traded volume to around $5.2 billion. Over the years, the Binance ecosystem has become a vibrant online community of developers and investors. As of this report, the total value locked (TVL) on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) was about $5.57B, and a stablecoins market cap of over $6B. However, the Binance exchange has registered the highest growth in stablecoins inflows in the recent past on various chains. With over 240M registered global users, Binance Exchange is well positioned to grow to a trillion-dollar company amid the mainstream adoption of BNB. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction (Dec 04th 2024) , Midterm Targets for BNB We entered $BNB earlier, but now at $740 and in price discovery, it couldn’t look better! https://t.co/Em0QuV8fIh — Ali (@ali_charts) December 3, 2024 After a successful bullish breakout to new ATH, BNB’s price is now well positioned to regain its prior fourth position, in terms of market cap.

This sudden jump pushed RSR’s price to $0.02518, its highest since early 2022.

The changes aim to clarify how the Corporations Act 2001 applies to digital assets and guide entities offering related financial services. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) included 13 practical examples in a document to show how current financial product definitions apply to digital assets and related products. Updated guidance will detail how businesses can obtain an Australian Financial Services (AFS) licence to handle digital assets classified as financial products. It also outlines the criteria ASIC uses to assess licence applications, emphasizing compliance with financial services laws. We have released a consultation paper outlining proposals to update our digital asset guidance: https://t.co/PR6k2KDgY7 pic.twitter.com/a3tuRbxOVR — ASIC Media (@asicmedia) December 3, 2024 Proposed updates also define the ongoing responsibilities for AFS licence holders dealing with digital assets. These include managing risks, providing necessary disclosures and ensuring financial services are delivered honestly and fairly. ASIC’s Draft Guidance Aims to Refocus ICOs, Define Stablecoin Legal Status Further, the proposed changes intend to shift focus away from initial coin offerings (ICOs), treating them as just one method of distributing digital assets. The regulator is also seeking input on classifying stablecoins and wrapped tokens under the regulatory framework. The goal is to clarify their legal status and keep the guidance relevant as the digital asset sector evolves. ASIC’s draft guidance will serve as a “living document,” updated regularly to match advancements in digital assets. Australia Regulator’s Final Updated Digital Asset Regulations Expected by Mid-2025 The regulator asked for feedback on key issues, including expected compliance costs, the potential impact on competition, and other related effects. It also sought views on introducing a class-wide “no action” position for digital asset businesses applying for or updating an AFS, Australian Markets, or Clearing and Settlement Facility licence. “Australia’s financial services regulatory regime is broad and technology neutral,” ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland said. “Many digital assets and related products are financial products under the current law. Stakeholders have been calling for greater clarity and in response, we are releasing our draft updated guidance.” “We encourage all stakeholders to engage with the consultation process. We recognise that industry will need some time to consider and act on our updated guidance, so we are also consulting on a proposed transitional approach.” In September, Kirkland told Cryptonews that ASIC planned to release new draft guidance soon and invite industry feedback on the updates. “Millions of Australians now hold crypto-asset investments and ASIC wants to make sure they have access to important consumer protections provided by the current regulatory regime” he said. Feedback on the proposed document is due by 5pm on Feb. 28, 2025. ASIC plans to release the final revised guidelines by mid-2025.

They say the former could rally to $200 while the latter might give investors 10x returns. Lunex’s potential gains have attracted Sui (SUI) investors as the token battle with bears. The cryptocurrency is on the brink of losing the $3 support level if the bearish momentum continues. Litecoin (LTC) Eyes Potential Upside To $200 The Litecoin token is trading in the green region as optimism builds up due to a potential LTC ETF hitting the market. Per CoinMarketCap , the value of Litecoin (LTC) has soared by 26.7% on the 7-day chart. The cryptocurrency is also bullish on the higher timeframes. On the 30-day level, the Litecoin price is up 74.6%. On the 14-day chart, there is a profit of 36.1%. Looking ahead, analysts are optimistic about the future of this altcoin . CryptoBullet, an anonymous trader, said on Sunday that the Litecoin price was trying to break out. In the case of a successful breakout, he forecasts a potential target of $233-$280. Also, prominent trader Peter Brandt wonders whether LTC could “pull another XRP” and soar to $420. Presently, the cryptocurrency’s relative strength index is above 70, signaling a high number of buyers. Also, the Hull Moving Average (9) and Average Directional Index (14) are displaying buy signals pointing to a potential uptrend. Sui (SUI) Price Plummets After a terrific price pump, the Sui coin has come under attack from bears. The Solana killer is currently on a downtrend and might lose the $3 level unless more buyers enter the market. Data from CoinMarketCap reveals the Sui (SUI) price has dipped 4.1% on the 7-day chart. There is also a loss of 11.2% in the 14-day chart. Despite the bearish trend, experts are looking forward to a trend reversal. They expect the Sui price to recover and soar to new peaks in the next few weeks. Paraboli8crypto says the value of the altcoin might rally to $10 before the end of December. Another analyst called CryptoBullet told his followers not to panic. According to him, pullbacks are healthy for the Sui crypto. He said the Sui token could rally to a range of $4.7-5.2 in the coming weeks. The coin’s technical indicators currently support this prediction. The relative strength index is above the midline, for example. The Hull Moving Average (9) is also flashing a buy signal. Lunex Network (LNEX) Presale Gains More Momentum Lunex Network (LNEX) continues to attract a lot of interest from investors in the DeFi market . Its ongoing ICO has already garnered over $4 million, and $LNEX tokens cost $0.0036. This strong start is attributed to growing confidence in Lunex’s early-stage concept of decentralized finance. And as the presale continues, the analysts have predicted a 10x increase for $LNEX. A special feature of Lunex is the possibility of exchanging assets between different blockchains. With the help of cross-chain swapping, one can swap over 50,000 tokens without any difficulty. As active traders are always in search of opportunities to minimize their time cross-chain trading becomes a crucial tool for those in the decentralized finance industry. Another feature is the B2B payment gateway that allows organizations to accept cryptocurrency and instantly convert it into fiat. This feature provides simple answers to how companies can embrace cryptocurrency in their operations. In addition, Lunex Network has a portfolio tracker. It provides you with an overall view of all investments, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, and ETFs. Portfolio tracking and control are made easy by the convenience of the users. These features make Lunex Network one of the best DeFi projects to watch out for in the market. Final Thoughts Litecoin (LTC) and Lunex Network are the top altcoins to watch right now.

Grayscale has filed with the SEC to launch a spot Solana ETF, potentially converting its existing Solana Trust into a publicly traded product on the New York Stock Exchange. Meanwhile, Orbitt has rolled out a staking program for its native token, ORBT, featuring a $2.5 million rewards pool and innovative buyback mechanisms to drive growth and engagement. Grayscale Files for Spot Solana ETF Amid Growing Competition and Solana’s Meteoric Rise Grayscale Investments, a leading digital asset manager, has officially filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF). If approved, the ETF, under the ticker GSOL, will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), marking a significant development in the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency ETFs. The filing, submitted on Dec. 3, proposes the conversion of the existing Grayscale Solana Trust into a spot ETF. This approach mirrors Grayscale’s earlier moves, where the company successfully converted its Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) trusts into ETFs. The potential approval of the Solana ETF would add another major milestone to Grayscale's portfolio. According to Grayscale's 19b-4 filing , the Grayscale Solana Trust is the largest Solana investment fund globally by assets under management (AUM), with holdings valued at approximately $134.2 million. This figure represents a considerable stake, accounting for roughly 0.1% of all Solana (SOL) tokens in circulation. The trust's transformation into a spot ETF would enhance its accessibility to retail and institutional investors, potentially driving further interest and investment in Solana’s ecosystem. Grayscale has appointed Coinbase Custody as the custodian for the ETF, ensuring the secure storage of its SOL holdings. Additionally, BNY Mellon Asset Servicing, a division of The Bank of New York Mellon, will act as the administrator and transfer agent for the trust. Grayscale’s filing comes at a time of intense competition among asset managers vying for SEC approval to list spot Solana ETFs. Other prominent firms, including 21Shares, Canary Capital, VanEck, and Bitwise, have also submitted proposals for similar products. Franklin Templeton, a heavyweight in traditional asset management, is reportedly exploring the possibility of launching its own spot Solana ETF, further heating up the race. Despite the crowded field, Grayscale’s existing position as the largest Solana investment fund may provide a strategic advantage. The company has already demonstrated its ability to navigate regulatory hurdles, as evidenced by its successful Bitcoin and Ether ETF conversions. To proceed, Grayscale must not only secure approval for its 19b-4 filing—which notifies the SEC of a proposed rule change by a financial regulatory body—but also file an S-1 registration statement. The S-1 approval would be critical, allowing Grayscale to list GSOL on public stock exchanges. The SEC’s decision will likely depend on its assessment of market maturity, surveillance mechanisms, and investor protection measures. The regulatory body has historically been cautious about approving spot cryptocurrency ETFs, citing concerns over market manipulation and insufficient oversight. However, the tide appears to be shifting, with the SEC recently displaying a more open stance toward crypto-based investment products. Solana’s Meteoric Rise The filing coincides with Solana's impressive market performance over the past year. The cryptocurrency has surged 277% in the last 12 months, reaching a market capitalization exceeding $112 billion. Currently trading at $238 per token, Solana has experienced a nearly 4% price increase since Grayscale’s filing. The blockchain's high-speed transaction capabilities and low fees have positioned it as a formidable competitor to Ethereum and other smart contract platforms. Solana's growing adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Web3 applications has fueled its price rally and attracted significant investor interest. Grayscale's move signals an increasing demand for cryptocurrency ETFs as a gateway for traditional investors to access digital assets. Spot ETFs, in particular, provide direct exposure to underlying cryptocurrencies, offering a simpler and more transparent alternative to futures-based ETFs. The launch of a spot Solana ETF could further legitimize the cryptocurrency in the eyes of mainstream investors, paving the way for broader institutional adoption. Moreover, it shines the spotlight on the ongoing evolution of financial markets as they adapt to the digital asset revolution. As Grayscale competes with its rivals and navigates regulatory scrutiny, the outcome of its filing will be closely watched by market participants. An approval could set a precedent for future spot cryptocurrency ETFs and potentially accelerate the integration of blockchain assets into the global financial system. Orbitt Launches ORBT Staking Program with $2.5 Million in Rewards, Revolutionizing Solana’s Ecosystem Solana's innovative network hub, Orbitt (ORBT), has unveiled its much-anticipated staking program, providing a substantial $2.5 million rewards pool for participants. Launched on Dec. 3, 2024, this program is designed to enhance community engagement, drive governance participation, and deliver consistent value for ORBT token holders. With its innovative features, including a buyback mechanism and tiered reward structure, the initiative aims to solidify Orbitt’s position as a leading player in Solana's ecosystem. The new staking program empowers ORBT holders to generate rewards while actively participating in the protocol’s governance and ecosystem. By staking ORBT, participants can unlock access to Orbitt’s flagship services, such as Orbitt PAD—a launchpad for vetted, high-potential projects seeking funding, development, and marketing support. The most promising projects on Orbitt PAD will also receive investments of up to $100,000, positioning them for successful launches and long-term growth. This dual benefit of community rewards and ecosystem support ensures a mutually beneficial relationship between stakers and Orbitt’s broader ecosystem. Pixel, the founder of Orbitt, expressed excitement about the staking program’s potential to drive organic growth and foster a stronger community: “We’re thrilled to bring ORBT staking to our community and reward those who believe in our long-term vision. This program exemplifies Orbitt’s dedication to sustainable growth and genuine value creation.” Orbitt’s Chief Marketing Officer echoed this sentiment, highlighting the program’s focus on rewarding trust and fostering participation within a community-driven ecosystem. A cornerstone of the ORBT staking program is its novel buyback mechanism, which ensures a steady flow of rewards for participants. Orbitt has allocated 25% of the total ORBT token supply—over five million tokens—to a buyback wallet dedicated to supporting the staking initiative. These tokens are not stagnant; instead, they are replenished using fees generated by Orbitt’s MM Volume Booster services, which purchase ORBT tokens from the market. This buyback mechanism not only sustains the rewards pool but also strengthens ORBT’s market dynamics by creating consistent demand, driving up the token’s value over time. Tiered Rewards Structure Incentivizes Long-Term Commitment The staking program is designed with a time-based tier system to incentivize long-term participation. Stakers can earn progressively higher rewards based on the duration of their commitment: 30 Days: Participants receive a 2x reward multiplier. 90 Days: Rewards increase to a 3x multiplier. 180 Days: Long-term stakers enjoy a maximum reward multiplier of 4x. This tiered structure is evidence of Orbitt’s emphasis on rewarding loyal community members who contribute to the platform’s stability and growth. Orbitt has carved a niche as a one-stop cryptocurrency ecosystem offering a range of B2B products on the Solana blockchain. The launch of its staking program is a strategic move to elevate its offerings and solidify its position as a leading network hub. By integrating staking rewards with tangible ecosystem benefits, such as Orbitt PAD and buyback mechanisms, Orbitt is redefining how blockchain projects drive community engagement and sustainable growth. The ORBT staking program marks a significant milestone for Orbitt and Solana's blockchain ecosystem. By offering substantial rewards and fostering active community participation, the program has the potential to attract a broader audience of investors and developers. Furthermore, the innovative buyback mechanism could serve as a model for other projects looking to align tokenomics with long-term growth. For Solana , Orbitt’s staking initiative enhances its appeal as a blockchain network capable of hosting robust, scalable ecosystems.

37196953,https://coinpaper.com/6368/peter-todd-argues-space-mining-for-bitcoin-is-within-reach,1733289163,Peter Todd Argues Space Mining for Bitcoin Is Within Reach,"Todd believes space-based crypto mining could very likely become a reality if launch costs decrease. On Earth, companies like MARA are taking advantage of renewable energy to power data centers with repurposed ASICs to reduce costs and environmental impact. Meanwhile, Foundry, the world's largest Bitcoin mining pool, is restructuring to focus on core operations post-halving. Virgin Voyages is embracing Bitcoin in another way by now accepting BTC for its exclusive ”Annual Pass,” which offers unlimited cruises for $120,000. Bitcoin Mining in Space Gains Traction Peter Todd recently sparked some interest with his blog post exploring the feasibility of establishing Bitcoin mining operations in space. Todd argues that mining crypto in space is not only technically possible with current technology but could also become economically viable if the costs of space cargo launches decrease. The concept of space-based crypto mining has been discussed for years already, and certain benefits like unlimited solar energy and the elimination of Earth-based carbon emissions are often mentioned. However, critics warn that the high costs of launching, constructing, and maintaining mining facilities in space could lead to centralized control by entities with larger financial resources. While these concerns are still an issue, Todd directly challenges some of the common technical objections to space mining. In his blog post, Todd brushed off the belief that cooling systems for mining hardware would struggle in space because of the absence of air. Instead, he explains that radiative cooling, which is a process where heat dissipates through thermal radiation , could very effectively tackle this issue. He also dismissed concerns about latency, and explained that careful positioning in a sun-synchronous orbit would minimize delays to negligible levels. Overall, Todd is convinced that there are no fundamental technological barriers preventing the development of space-based mining stations. Todd did acknowledge that economic feasibility is still a key hurdle. He believes there is a need to reduce launch costs to achieve profitability. If launch costs can align with the economic potential of mining operations, space mining could become a reality. The possibility of reduced launch costs are not that far fetched, especially with some of the recent advancements in space exploration led by SpaceX . The company’s Starship rocket set new records for payload capacity and thrust. CEO Elon Musk envisions making space travel a lot more affordable and practical. Some of Musk’s long-term goals include the colonization of Mars. If successful, these innovations could pave the way for more cost-effective extraterrestrial ventures, including crypto mining. Whether or not this concept actually materializes in the near future, it still serves as a glimpse into the exciting possibilities for Bitcoin and blockchain technology. Renewable Energy Powers MARA's ASIC Initiative Conventional crypto mining companies are also exploring innovative ways of doing business. MARA, which was formerly known as Marathon Digital, acquired a wind farm in Hansford County, Texas, as part of its Advanced ASIC Retirement Initiative. The facility has 114 MW of operational wind generation and 240 MW of interconnection capacity. The acquisition ensures the wind farm's energy will not be curtailed due to excess interconnection capacity , which is a very common issue with alternative power sources in the United States. Instead of connecting the facility to the power grid, MARA plans to use the energy directly to power a data center. This center will run last-generation application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which would otherwise be thrown out or sold on secondary markets. MARA’s chairman and CEO, Fred Thiel is taking the company’s commitment to environmental stewardship very seriously, and believes in the benefits of repurposing ASICs and leveraging zero-marginal-cost renewable energy to lower Bitcoin production costs through vertical integration. As of late 2023, MARA operates a fleet of around 200,000 ASICs . The company is still the largest publicly listed Bitcoin miner despite facing a $124.8 million net loss in the third quarter of 2024. This was partly due to a $40 million increase in operational expenses. However, MARA still reported a 34.5% year-on-year revenue increase for the same quarter, reaching $131.6 million. Adding to its strength, MARA disclosed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it bought 6,484 BTC between October and November of 2024 for $618.3 million in cash. As a result, its total treasury stands at approximately 34,797 BTC, which is valued at around $3.3 billion. In October, the company also achieved its highest production since the April halving by mining 717 BTC. Foundry Restructures with 27% Staff Layoffs Foundry, the largest Bitcoin mining pool globally, laid off 27% of its workforce as part of a planned restructuring. The cuts affected 16% of its U.S.-based employees and a portion of its team in India, according to sources. Foundry's parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), revealed plans to spin off Foundry’s self-mining business into a separate entity still under DCG’s control. This move is part of a strategic effort to refocus Foundry on its core operations as the top Bitcoin mining pool and to expand its site operations business. Bitcoin mining pools comparison (Source: Hashrate Index ) Foundry USA, the mining pool operated by Foundry, controls approximately one-third of the global market share among pool operators, which makes it a very dominant player in the industry. Alongside its mining pool operations, Foundry also runs a self-mining business that DCG estimates will generate close to $80 million in revenue by the end of 2024. DCG believes that spinning off the self-mining business as a standalone subsidiary will strengthen its operations. The company also plans to bring in external hires and raise additional capital to support the initiative. Foundry’s restructuring is nothing new, as it reflects broader trends in the Bitcoin mining industry where companies are adapting to the challenges posed after the April halving. This event cuts the number of BTC mined per block in half, which increased operational costs and mining difficulty. Despite these challenges, miners continue to invest in new infrastructure and expand their operations in anticipation of future price increases, according to CoinShares’ Q3 mining report . Virgin Cruises Now Payable with Bitcoin Other companies are also embracing Bitcoin in new and exciting ways. Virgin Voyages announced the launch of its “ Annual Pass ” program for 2025, along with its entry into crypto acceptance by becoming the first cruise product to accept Bitcoin. The new program allows passengers to enjoy unlimited cruises for a year, starting at $120,000 plus taxes, payable in Bitcoin. The company did not share any plans to expand its crypto options to include stablecoins or altcoins. The Annual Pass builds on the success of Virgin’s previous “Season Pass” program, which targeted remote workers with a “work from sea” experience. Virgin Group founder Richard Branson is excited about the unlimited travel opportunities it offers across a variety of destinations. The pass includes double-occupancy access to a Sea Terrace cabin, which features a private balcony, along with perks like laundry service, internet access, and a $100 bar tab for each voyage. By integrating Bitcoin, Virgin Voyages positioned itself as a leader in adopting crypto in the travel industry. This move could be very attractive to some whales who might see the offering as a unique way to spend their crypto. While not matching the extravagant lifestyles of yachts and luxury cars often associated with the crypto elite, the Annual Pass still provides an exclusive travel experience.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6368/peter-todd-argues-space-mining-for-bitcoin-is-within-reach,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

37197526,https://invezz.com/?p=2352473,1733288937,"Here’s why the EOS, NEO, and BitTorrent prices are surging","Old-school cryptocurrencies are in a strong bull run this week, largely outperforming newer ones. EOS price jumped to a high of $1.5230, its highest level since September 22. It has jumped in the past five consecutive weeks and is up by 250% from its lowest level this year. NEO, another cryptocurrency, jumped to $26.14, its highest level since April 2022. BitTorrent price jumped to $0.000001910, up by 176% from its lowest level this year. Inspired by Ripple and Stellar The main reason for the ongoing EOS, NEO, and BitTorrent prices is that they have been inspired by the recent success of Ripple (XRP) and Stellar Lumens (XLM), which have soared by almost 500% in the past 30 days. Ripple’s market cap has also jumped to over $125 billion, making it the third biggest crypto in the industry. It is slowly nearing its all-time high Similarly, Stellar Lumens , the popular payment-focused coin has also jumped, mirroring that of Ripple. The two have a common history since Jed McCaleb, Stellar’s founder, was also on the team that started Ripple Labs . The two coins have risen because of the recent Donald Trump victory, which promises changes at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Gary Gensler is expected to resign in January, while Trump is considering picking Paul Atkins to be the next head of the agency. The new changes mean that Ripple’s legal challenges could end soon, and that a spot XRP ETF will be listed as soon as in 2025. Ripple has largely won the case brought in 2020. In July last year, a judge ruled that XRP was not a security but that Ripple Labs had committed a crime in its fundraising. As a result, she ordered the company to pay a $250 million fine earlier this year, much lower than the $2 billion that the agency was seeking. The SEC has pledged to appeal the ruling, putting Ripple Labs in legal jeopardy. Therefore, EOS, NEO, and BitTorrent are rising as many cryptocurrencies that became hugely popular in 2021 aim to be the next XRP. Indeed, many others, including Litecoin, Tron, and Bitcoin Cash have all gone vertical. EOS price analysis Technicals also explain why coins like EOS and NEO are soaring. The weekly chart shows that the EOS price has bounced back after being in a consolidation between $0.4325 and $1.3640 in the past three years. It formed a triple bottom at $0.4325 and has now jumped above its neckline at $1.3640. EOS price has moved above the 50-week moving average, signaling that the uptrend may continue. If this happens, the next key resistance level to watch will be at $3, the highest point in March 2022. If that happens, it will imply a 115% above the current level. Neo price forecast The weekly chart shows a close similarity between the EOS and NEO prices. It has formed a cup and handle pattern and is attempting to rise above the key resistance level at $24.18, its highest level in April 2024. The NEO price has jumped above the 50-week moving average, while oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD have continued to point upwards. Therefore, the coin will likely continue rising as bulls target the next important resistance level at $50 in the near term. A drop below the support at $20 will invalidate the bullish view. BitTorrent price analysis The daily chart shows that the BitTorrent token has jumped, mirroring the performance of Tron, which has surged to a record high. BTT and TRX are related because they are owned by Justin Sun. The BTT token has formed a golden cross pattern as the 200-day and 50-day moving averages crossed each other. It is also forming a cup and handle pattern whose upper side is at $0.0000022, its highest level in March. Therefore, the coin will likely continue rising as bulls target that level, which is about 30% above the current level.

SOL price is rising and might aim for a move above the $240 and $250 resistance levels. SOL price started a fresh increase after it settled above the $222 level against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $230 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $232 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if the bulls clear the $240 zone. Solana Price Eyes Fresh Surge Solana price formed a support base and started a fresh increase above the $220 level like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a decent increase above the $225 and $230 resistance levels. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $246 swing high to the $215 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $232 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading above $235 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $240 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $246 swing high to the $215 low. The next major resistance is near the $246 level. The main resistance could be $250. A successful close above the $250 resistance level could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $265. Any more gains might send the price toward the $280 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $240 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $230 level or the 100-hourly simple moving average. The first major support is near the $220 level. A break below the $220 level might send the price toward the $215 zone. If there is a close below the $215 support, the price could decline toward the $200 support in the near term.

Positive Sentiment Vs. Negative Sentiment Ratio Remains Low For Top Coins According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, sentiment around digital assets has been low recently, even for the coins that have enjoyed historic runs. The indicator of relevance here is the “Positive Sentiment Vs. Negative Sentiment Ratio,” which, as its name suggests, tells us about how the positive and negative comments about a given asset being made by social media users currently compare. This metric sources data from major social media platforms like X, Telegram, Reddit, and 4Chan. It puts these posts/messages/threads containing mentions of the relevant term through a machine-learning model to differentiate between positive and negative ones, and finds the difference in their count. Related Reading: Strong Bitcoin Rise “Expected Within 1-2 Months,” Quant Explains Why When the value of this indicator is positive, it means the posts about a positive sentiment outweigh the ones containing a negative sentiment. On the other hand, being negative implies that a bearish mentality is dominant on social media. Here is a chart showing the recent trend in the Positive Sentiment Vs. Negative Sentiment Ratio for five assets: Bitcoin (BTC), XRP (XRP), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and Stellar (XLM). As displayed in the above graph, the Positive Sentiment Vs. Negative Sentiment Ratio has remained almost neutral for all these cryptocurrencies recently. This suggests the market isn’t leaning one way or the other. The trend is interesting, considering XRP, Cardano, and Stellar have seen massive price surges. Generally, positive comments tend to spike when such rallies occur, like they did for Bitcoin early last month when Donald Trump won the US Presidential Elections. Historically, digital assets have often shown moves opposite to what the crowd expects. This means that a price correction can become probable whenever bullish sentiment grows too big. Related Reading: Dogecoin TD Sell Signal Goes Off, But Here’s Why Parabolic Bull Run Can Still Continue Considering that euphoria hasn’t overtaken the investors of XRP and others despite the price surges, it’s possible that their runs could still have room to continue. The Positive Sentiment Vs. Negative Sentiment Ratio could still be to keep an eye on in the near future, however, as social media sentiment can sometimes flip very quickly, especially if some big news comes out. A spike in the indicator would naturally be a bearish sign for the market. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $2.58, up almost 17% over the past seven days.

However, contrary to what one might expect, there hasn’t been a significant surge in profit-taking activity among these large holders, a CryptoQuant analyst named onatt revealed in a recent post on the QuickTake platform. Related Reading: Bitcoin to Enter Final Bull Phase? Key Indicator Hints at Major Price Movement Whale Activity Suggests Market Stability but Signals Potential Risks The report by CryptoQuant analyst Onatt sheds light on this whale activity, emphasizing the lack of immediate selling pressure despite the increase in Bitcoin inflows to exchanges. Instead of liquidating their holdings, whales appear to be employing a “wait-and-see strategy,” the analyst wrote. They seem to utilize their Bitcoin for purposes like hedging, over-the-counter (OTC) transactions, or collateral. Although this approach points to market stability, onatt advised that “these movements should be closely monitored to anticipate any possible market impact.” Providing more details of this development, Onatt’s analysis reveals that the Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric, which tracks profit-taking activities, does not yet signal significant movements. Historically, large inflows of Bitcoin into exchanges have often been associated with increased selling pressure, but the current scenario deviates from this trend. Instead, these movements may reflect strategic maneuvers by whales as they prepare for potential market shifts. Onatt also noted that while the immediate risk of sell-offs appears low, the ongoing rise in Bitcoin exchange inflows could foreshadow future volatility. Bitcoin Market Performance Bitcoin so far appears to have hit a wall ever since it traded above $95,000. Over the past weeks, Bitcoin has been unable to move further from this price level but has managed to maintain it despite the bears attempts to push it below $95,000. Over the past week, BTC hasn’t moved much and only registers 2.5% increase and in the past 24 hours, the asset has seen just a slight decrease by 1.2% to trade for $95,837 at the time of writing currently. As for Bitcoin’s daily trading volume, interestingly, there has been an opposite trend. Despite Bitcoin’s small price movement into decline, BTC daily trading volume has notably increased from below $60 billion on November 29 to now at $94.5 billion.

Remember when Dogecoin started as a joke and then skyrocketed thanks to a few Elon Musk tweets? Yeah, we all do. And then came Shiba Inu, which followed the same meme-to-mainstream trajectory. Now, meme coins aren’t just for laughs—they’re serious investment opportunities. Investors love ‘em for their low entry prices and massive growth potential. So, what’s the next big thing? Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD) . This one’s shaking up the meme coin scene with promises of massive returns, exciting features like a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and a passionate community. If you’ve been on the fence about meme coins, BTFD might just be the nudge you need. BTFD isn’t your average meme coin—it’s built to go viral while offering real utility. Analysts are already buzzing about its potential, and the presale, which launched on November 26, 2024, is already a hot topic. Let’s dive in and see why this is being called the best crypto coin to buy right now. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Taking Utility to New Heights BTFD Coin is already making waves in its 6th presale stage, priced at $0.000058. With over $700,000 raised and 18 billion tokens sold in just one week, the coin’s buzz is undeniable. More than 1,700 holders have joined the BTFD movement, eager to capitalize on its innovative features. The standout feature is its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, which lets users earn tokens while gaming. Combine that with 90% APY staking rewards and the Bulls Squad—a community initiative driving growth—and you’ve got a project that’s much more than hype. Set to list at $0.0006 after the presale, BTFD boasts a potential 15,000% ROI. This meme coin blends humor with real-world utility, making it one of the best crypto coins to buy in 2024. Pepe Coin: The OG Meme Coin Keeping It Real Ah, Pepe Coin. If you’ve been in the crypto world for a minute, you’ve probably heard of this one. It’s one of the OGs in the meme coin world, riding on the back of the infamous Pepe the Frog meme. While it doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of newer coins like BTFD, it’s got something just as powerful: nostalgia and community. Pepe Coin’s strength lies in its simplicity and its die-hard fanbase. It’s the kind of coin that thrives on hype and grassroots support. The coin has seen its ups and downs, but it’s still holding strong, proving that meme power is a force to be reckoned with. Recently, analysts have been keeping a close eye on Pepe’s price action. After a modest dip earlier this year, it’s showing signs of life. With a projected high of $0.00000115 this December, Pepe’s climbing back up the ranks. Its community remains its backbone, fueling campaigns and keeping the excitement alive. Sure, it might not promise a 15,000% ROI like BTFD, but it’s a solid pick for those who love a bit of nostalgia mixed with speculative fun. Pepe Coin also serves as a reminder of how far meme coins have come. It’s proof that these tokens aren’t just fleeting trends—they’re here to stay. And while newer coins like BTFD are stealing the spotlight, Pepe’s still in the game, making it one of the best crypto coins to buy for anyone looking to diversify. Conclusion: Don’t Sleep on BTFD Coin If you’ve been waiting for a sign to jump into the crypto game, this is it. BTFD Coin’s presale is a golden opportunity to get in early and ride the wave of meme coin success. With its P2E game, sky-high staking rewards, and community-driven growth, it’s poised to be a game-changer. Pepe Coin has its place as a nostalgic favorite, but if you’re looking for the next big thing, BTFD is where it’s at. The combination of massive ROI potential and real-world utility makes it a standout in the meme coin market. Don’t miss out—head over to the presale page and make your move.

Now, he’s up against U.S. prosecutors who accuse him of dodging $48 million in taxes tied to Bitcoin sales. Ver isn’t just denying the charges. He’s calling the tax rules themselves unconstitutional. Pushing Back Against the IRS On December 3, Ver filed a motion in California federal court , arguing that the IRS’s exit tax violates basic constitutional rights. The exit tax, meant to ensure citizens pay their dues before renouncing their U.S. citizenship, is a hefty blow for anyone with over $2 million in assets. Ver, who gave up his U.S. citizenship in 2014 for Japanese citizenship, says the rules around digital assets are too vague. He also pointed out that back in 2014, Bitcoin markets weren’t liquid enough to make settling the tax easy. His legal team argues the IRS’s tax law clashes with both the Apportionment Clause and the Due Process Clause. But will the court agree? Prosecutors Say It’s More Than a Mistake The prosecution paints a very different picture. They claim Ver deliberately avoided reporting $240 million in Bitcoin sales and filed false tax returns. According to them, it’s a clear case of tax evasion and fraud. If convicted, Ver could face up to 30 years in prison. That’s a big deal, especially for someone with Ver’s influence in the crypto space. Still, Ver maintains he had no intent to cheat the system, pointing to documents that supposedly prove he followed the rules. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinbase Takes a Stand: No Business with Anti-Crypto Lawyers , A Controversial Figure Ver’s journey has been anything but smooth.

37195616,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=373238,1733286500,"XRP, DOGE Fuel Massive Change in South Korea’s Market Structure: Details","Retail cryptocurrency trading in South Korea has reached new heights, surpassing the country’s stock market by $4 billion in just 24 hours. The increase was driven by major trading activity in several altcoins, including Ripple’s XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), Stellar (XLM), Ethereum Name Service (ENS), and Hedera (HBAR). South Korea’s Retail Crypto Trading Hits $18 Billion According to a 10x Research report, South Korea’s retail crypto trading volumes surged to $18 billion on December 2, marking the second-highest level of the year. Ripple’s XRP led the charge with over $6.3 billion in trading volume. DOGE followed with $1.6 billion, while XLM recorded $1.3 billion. Other notable altcoins included ENS at $900 million and HBAR at $800 million. Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, explained that this has resulted in one of the largest recorded divergences. “These high-momentum cryptocurrencies are being driven predominantly by retail traders, capitalizing on and reinforcing momentum-driven trends.” He highlighted that Bitcoin’s funding rate, which is relatively low at just 15% annually, combined with the recent increase in altcoin trading, clearly signals the start of an altcoin season. The expert also advised traders to remain disciplined while seizing these opportunities. Ripple XRP’s Gains XRP has been staging a historic rally over the past month, crossing the $2.80 mark for the first time in nearly seven years. As of this writing, CoinGecko data shows that the token is trading at $2.67, just 21.3% below its all-time high of $3.40 in January 2018. This price surge has propelled XRP to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, overtaking Solana (SOL) and Tether (USDT). South Korea has been a major contributor to this surge, with XRP/KRW trading volume on Upbit, the country’s largest crypto exchange, hitting $3.8 billion on December 2. According to blockchain analytics firm Scopescan, this figure was 11 times higher than Bitcoin’s trading volume on the platform. Thielen’s report also highlighted the global shift towards more crypto-friendly policies. Trading activity has changed since the Trump election, and with the new U.S. administration expected to support cryptocurrency, he believes this momentum will likely persist. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also recently discussed the impact of Trump’s triumph, noting that U.S.-based crypto companies have benefited from his win due to the Democrats’ hostile stance on the industry. This has been proven true, with XRP seeing impressive gains since then.

Elon’s Billions (ELONBILL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONBILL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Billions can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Billions could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Billions launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Billions on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Billions by entering its contract address – 5VkZGZPArjvA7aDTMVenePmqW62rRZtugUPqC8kEXaez – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONBILL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/elons-billions-elonbill-solana-memecoin-will-explode-17000-before-exchange-listings-as-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Now, the founder pleaded guilty and agreed to be jailed for 30 years. Alex Mashinsky, the founder and ex-CEO of Celcius Network, is set to plead guilty to fraud charges, Reuters reported on Dec. 03. The federal prosecutor accused Mashinsky of pur suing customers to invest in them and unnaturally inflating the value of the company on the crypto token. In order to deal with prosecutors, Mashinsky agreed to be jailed in prison for 30 years or less. Therefore, his sentence is set to be announced by the court later next year on Apr. 08. “I know what I did was wrong, and I want to try to do whatever I can to make it right,” he said. Previously, he was counted for seven charges, including fraud, conspiracy, and market manipulation since last year. In cou rt, he stated that he pleaded guilty to two out of those seven charges, which were commodity fraud and manipulating the Celcius token ( CEL ) price back in 2021.

37203298,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315931,1733284309,Ex-Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky Pleads Guilty to Fraud Charges in Crypto Lender Scandal,"Alex Mashinsky, founder of the now-bankrupt Celsius Network, announced Tuesday that he intends to plead guilty to fraud charges. He pleaded guilty to two charges: one for commodities fraud and another for manipulating the price of the Celsius token. The most serious charge carries a potential 20-year prison sentence. On July 13, 2023, Mashinsky faced indictment on seven charges, including fraud, conspiracy and market manipulation. He initially declared himself not guilty on the day of the indictment, but has since reversed his plea. The Justice Department said Mashinsky committed securities fraud tied to two separate schemes. In one, Mashinsky misled Celsius customers about key aspects of the company, including its financial stability and how it managed customer funds, the department said. In the other, he secretly manipulated the CEL token’s market while selling his own holdings at inflated prices. Under his plea deal, Mashinsky agreed to forfeit over $48m in profits from these illegal activities to the Justice Department. Ex-Celsius CEO Admits to Fraud, Faces Up to 30 Years in Prison In court, Mashinsky admitted to misleading Celsius customers by giving them “false comfort.” He acknowledged falsely stating in a 2021 interview that Celsius had regulatory approval for its Earn program, which used customer crypto assets to generate returns. Mashinsky also confessed to failing to disclose his personal sale of CEL tokens, the company’s token. “I knew what I did was wrong and I want to do whatever I can to make it right,” Mashinsky said to US District Judge John Koeltl. “I accept full responsibility for my actions.” Mashinsky agreed with prosecutors not to appeal any sentence of 30 years or less, the maximum penalty for the two counts he admitted to. Koeltl is scheduled to sentence him on April 8, 2025. US Attorney Says Mashinsky Ran One of the Largest Crypto Scams in History “Alexander Mashinsky orchestrated one of the biggest frauds in the crypto industry,” said US Attorney Damian Williams. “He lured ordinary, retail crypto investors into investing billions of dollars in Celsius with false promises that their investments were low-risk.” “To disguise the flaws in his business model, Mashinsky put investors’ money into riskier and riskier bets, and secretly used customer money to prop up the price of CEL token. Mashinsky made tens of millions of dollars selling his own CEL at artificially high prices, while his customers were left holding the bag when the company went bankrupt.” Under Mashinsky’s leadership, Celsius initially thrived by offering high interest rates on digital-asset deposits. However, the firm faced financial trouble after the TerraUSD stablecoin collapse and a subsequent downturn in crypto markets, which left it unable to meet overwhelming withdrawal requests. Celsius’s 2022 collapse became a defining moment in the crypto sector, marking the onset of the “crypto winter.” This period saw a steep decline in digital asset values, erasing billions from the market. Alongside other major failures, such as Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX, Celsius’s downfall deepened the broader crisis within the crypto industry. Creditors have received about $3b so far, covering both the initial and second distributions . Most payouts are being made in cryptocurrency.

The Altcoin Season Index hitting an all-time high of 88/100 signals a massive shift in focus to alts, and Solana is once again in the spotlight. Alongside market giants like $ XRP , which exploded 400% in November, $ BNB (new ATH at $770, just now), and $ HBAR , which continues its ETF-driven rally, Solana stands at a crossroads. Source: coinmarket.com Having recently set a new all-time high (ATH) of $264, surpassing its 2021 record, Solana has entered a critical consolidation phase. While XRP and HBAR thrive on institutional buzz, Solana’s recent stagnation raises questions: Is this a healthy pause before price discovery, or is there resistance to further growth? With Greyscale filing for a Solana ETF, the asset is undoubtedly primed for institutional attention, making now the perfect time to dissect Solana’s next moves. Current Situation: From Deep Accumulation to Smart Profit-Taking Solana's journey has been nothing short of remarkable. After setting its previous ATH of $260 in 2021, the bear market was brutal. Following the FTX collapse in late 2022, Solana hit lows of $6-$10, levels that seemed to solidify a near-death narrative. However, a prolonged accumulation phase throughout 2023 and early 2024 paved the way for a stunning recovery. Those smart investors who bought in at these rock-bottom levels are now seeing ROI upwards of 25-40x, explaining the current profit-taking pressure at the recent ATH of $264. However, this consolidation isn’t a cause for concern but rather a natural market cycle of profit-taking and positioning for the next leg up. Combined with Solana’s fundamentals and ETF buzz, this phase is laying the groundwork for a new wave of institutional and retail demand. Fundamentals: Where Solana Shines (and Struggles) The Case for Solana’s Strength Solana’s fundamentals are outstanding, combining innovation, growth, and institutional appeal: Scalability and Speed: Solana consistently leads in transactions per second (TPS), positioning it as the fastest layer-1 blockchain. Ecosystem Growth: Solana’s ecosystem boasts a thriving NFT marketplace, record-breaking DeFi activity, and high developer engagement, as highlighted by Messari's on-chain reports. It’s the blockchain of choice for cutting-edge applications. Institutional Appeal: Fidelity’s ETF application is a game-changer, aligning Solana with Bitcoin and Ethereum in institutional narratives. This alone could drive billions of dollars into Solana upon approval, marking it as a top contender for the next institutional favorite. Tokenomics and Inflation Market Cap: $112.49 billion, ranking Solana as the 5th largest cryptocurrency. Inflation: Solana’s circulating supply has grown by 17.02% year-over-year (source: Messari). While its ecosystem’s adoption rate and activity often offset this inflation, long-term growth may face limitations compared to deflationary or capped-supply cryptos like Ethereum. Fundamental Rating: 8.8/10 Solana shines in adoption and innovation but must address inflationary concerns to fully match Ethereum’s deflationary edge. Technical Analysis: The Blueprint for Traders Solana’s price action has displayed critical developments over time: After reclaiming $210 post-election (November 6), it flipped this major resistance into support, bolstered by massive volume. The recent ATH of $264 was marked by exhaustion in buying pressure, signaling profit-taking from long-term holders. The $186-$189 zone, a major resistance in mid-2024, has since transformed into a strong support level. Moving averages, particularly the 100-day and 200-day MAs, are climbing toward the $186 level, reinforcing its importance as a dip-buying opportunity. Future price continuation hinges on maintaining key support zones and breaking above $270, which would trigger explosive upward momentum. Here’s the actionable roadmap for traders: Strategy 1: “Dip Buy Setup – Catch It Low or Let It Go” If Bitcoin faces rejection at $100K, Solana will likely follow broader market corrections. Look for key levels: $210-$215: This high-probability buy zone is supported by the 50-day MA, which provides strong dynamic support. $186-$189: A critical level flipped into support on November 6, following massive volume during Election Day. Additionally, both the 100-day and 200-day MAs are climbing toward this level, further strengthening it as a buy-the-dip target. Adding moonbag potential: For long-term holders, these dips could serve as prime accumulation zones for moonbags (long-term holdings to ride explosive future growth). Strategy 2: “The Balanced Play – Buy Now, Watch ATH Levels” Buying at current levels ($236-$240) lets you participate in the rally while managing risk: Support Zone: $210-$215 is a critical must-hold level. A breakdown here signals further downside. Resistance at ATH: Pay close attention to the $260-$264 zone. A rejection here confirmed by: Volume divergence (lower buy volume near ATH). RSI signals (overbought on lower timeframes). Would indicate potential range-bound trading below $260. Trim positions or trade the range if necessary. Upside Scenario: A breakout above $270 could result in fireworks, with targets at $300 (psychological level)—and who knows how much higher. Use trailing stops to secure profits on this move. Strategy 3: “Breakout Chase – Ride the Momentum” The safest play is waiting for Solana to decisively break above $264 and confirm price discovery: Confirmation Signal: A daily close above $264 with significant volume. Targets: Fibonacci extensions suggest levels at $300, $320, and $350, supported by higher timeframe cup-and-handle patterns. Moonbag Strategy: For breakout traders, setting a moonbag portion above $300 allows you to ride further uncharted gains while locking in profits on the initial move. Post-breakout, $260-$265 becomes critical support. Monitor this zone carefully—if it holds, it confirms sustainability. Trend Health: Is Solana Ready for Takeoff? Volume: Diminished post-ATH, signaling buyer exhaustion. However, ETF news or a BTC rally could reignite momentum. Moving Averages: The 50-day MA ($210) acts as strong dynamic support, while the 200-day MA ($186) protects against deeper corrections. Relative Strength vs. Bitcoin: Solana’s BTC pair is trading near a multi-year resistance. A breakout above 0.0028 BTC would signal strength and decoupling, opening the doors for independent rallies. Institutional Demand: Solana vs XRP and HBAR While XRP and HBAR ride their ETF narratives, Solana is just entering the game: XRP: XRP saw 400% gains in November after multiple ETF filings and renewed institutional confidence post-SEC settlement. HBAR: Its enterprise focus and ETF buzz make it a top performer in altcoin season. Solana: Greyscale’s ETF application positions Solana as the next institutional favorite, especially as it combines enterprise adoption with DeFi and retail appeal. ETF approval could drive exponential demand. Summary: Solana’s Path Forward Solana’s $264 ATH and ETF buzz set the stage for explosive growth, but inflation and consolidation demand caution. Whether you: Buy the dip during corrections, Trade the current range, or Wait for a confirmed breakout, having a clear plan is critical. The $186-$189 zone and $210-$215 support levels offer prime opportunities to build positions or hold moonbags, while $260-$265 holds the key to sustained rallies. With $112 billion in market cap, Solana trails XRP’s $145 billion, setting the stage for crypto’s next big rivalry. Will Solana overtake XRP? Only time will tell. As altcoin dominance surges, Solana’s blend of innovation, ecosystem growth, and institutional interest makes it a standout. The question isn’t if Solana will break higher—it’s when.

Current SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced he will step down on January 20 when Trump is inaugurated. Atkins, who served as an SEC commissioner under President George W. Bush, is well-respected in conservative legal circles and among the Republican establishment. One major case before the federal courts is the ongoing Ripple (XRP) lawsuit, in which the SEC claims Ripple violated securities laws by issuing XRP. In July 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP was not a security when sold to retail investors on exchanges but was a security in institutional sales. The SEC initially sought a $2 billion fine against Ripple but was instead given a $125 million penalty. In October 2024, Judge Torres rejected the SEC’s request to appeal, saying they didn’t have strong enough reasons. Despite this, the SEC appealed to the Second Circuit Court, arguing the decision went against Supreme Court rulings. ‘Paul Atkins is not what Trump Needs’ John Deaton recently explained that Paul Atkins would be a very traditional choice, one that Wall Street would likely approve of. He stated that Atkins is someone who respects the SEC and its staff, but what is truly needed is someone who challenges the SEC’s actions. Deaton believes the SEC has harmed investors, rather than protecting them, and that a change in attitude is necessary. While Deaton would support Atkins if chosen, he feels he’s not the right fit if President Trump aims to bring change to crypto regulation. Trump picks former SEC head Paul Atkins to chair his SEC. Pros: He has advocated for reasonable (and workable) regulation in the digital asset space – especially with the exchanges. He's a steady hand who was SEC chair for 8 years. It will be hard for the Dems to attack him.… https://t.co/3RgVq0PxRL — Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) December 3, 2024 Attorney Jeremy Hogan mentioned the cons of Atkins’ appointment and wrote, “He won’t be the bull in the china shop many in the crypto space want. He will make measured and deliberate changes. Overall, I give his appointment a B+ for the digital asset industry, and that was good enough to get me a law degree so, yeah!”",NEUTRAL,XRP,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-lawsuit-news-can-genslers-replacement-paul-atkins-dismiss-ripple-case/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

He specifically called out Milbank LLP for hiring Gurbir Grewal, a former SEC enforcement director, saying it was a “mess up.” But why is this such a big deal for crypto? Let’s dive in. Grewal’s Record: Tensions with Crypto Gurbir Grewal isn’t exactly popular in the crypto world. While he was with the SEC, he led more than 100 enforcement actions against major crypto companies. Along with Coinbase, other crypto exchanges like Binance, Kraken, and Gemini were all caught up in his actions. This is not a new problem for crypto firms. The SEC has been going behind them taking legal actions sometimes. They want the exchanges to follow rules when there are no rules established. Coinbase’s Pushback Despite the tension, Grewal defended his actions, saying the SEC wasn’t trying to target crypto, just enforce the law. But many in the crypto world aren’t buying it. They feel the rules are unclear, and that the SEC’s stance isn’t helping anyone. So, Coinbase decided to push back. The company even took the SEC to court, demanding clearer rules for digital assets. Eugene Scalia from Gibson Dunn & Crutcher is representing them in this fight. Meanwhile, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, took to social media to make one thing clear: any law firm that hires lawyers like Grewal is going to lose Coinbase’s business. It’s a bold move, and it’s clear that Coinbase isn’t backing down from this battle. This shouldn't be terribly complicated to understand. 1/4 https://t.co/LtMbY2WSrA — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) December 3, 2024 What Happens Next? Coinbase’s warning to law firms is shaking things up. Legal experts are saying this could cost firms big money if they choose to work with controversial figures like Grewal.

This significant milestone reflects a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market, where attention has shifted from Bitcoin (BTC) to altcoins like BNB and XRP, both of which have demonstrated impressive price movements over the past 48 hours. BNB Price’s 235% Year-to-Date Gain After a prolonged consolidation period between $430 and $600 from September to early November, BNB has surged nearly 25% in just the past two weeks. This increase is part of a capital rotation within the market, drawing investor interest toward cryptocurrencies such as Binance Coin. The token’s breakout above the critical resistance level of $658 marks a pivotal moment, indicating increased buying demand and renewed market confidence. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price At $1.3-$1.5 Is Still Possible, Here’s Why Year-to-date, BNB has delivered remarkable gains of 235%, especially following a significant downturn earlier in 2023 when the token fell to around $203. This decline was largely attributed to regulatory challenges faced by Binance, including charges of money laundering against the company and its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), which ultimately led to CZ stepping down. Although trading volumes on the exchange dropped in response, optimism has resurfaced, particularly with anticipated regulatory changes under the incoming administration of Donald Trump in 2025. In addition, the current US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler, has recently announced its departure effective on January 20, coinciding with Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration. This could pave the way not only for further capital injection into the Binance Coin, but also open a range of new investment vehicles such as the surging crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) market led by Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH). Key Levels To Watch As Binance Coin Approaches $800 BNB’s market cap has surged in tandem with its price, reaching approximately $93 billion before the recent 17% price increase, which pushed its market cap to over $112 billion. This price action has been accompanied by a notable increase in trading volume, which rose 14% in the last 24 hours, totaling just over $5 billion, according to CoinGecko data. These developments have contributed to a strong upward trend, positioning BNB closer to the $800 milestone. However, investor behavior, particularly potential profit-taking, and the maintenance of key support levels will be crucial in determining the token’s trajectory moving forward. Related Reading: Cardano Next In Line After XRP? ADA Price Targets $4.88 In Epic Breakout Crypto analyst Ali Martinez previously highlighted a critical price point, suggesting that a weekly close above $662 could set BNB up for a significant move towards $1,630. Interestingly, Binance Coin closed the past week just above this mark at $663, which implies a further surge of approximately 110%, which would represent a major milestone for the token in the coming months. For BNB to maintain this optimistic outlook, it will be essential for the token to consolidate around current trading levels, particularly near the last demand zone at $660. Although this support level is below the current price of $773, it remains a crucial area for sustaining momentum and facilitating potential future gains for Binance Coin.

With a mix of established giants and innovative newcomers, the options for savvy investors are expanding. Among the heavyweights like Bitcoin and Ethereum, fresh contenders like Qubetics are making waves, promising unique solutions to real-world problems. So, whether you’re a seasoned trader or just dipping your toes into the crypto waters, let’s dive into the best crypto coins to buy in December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS) stands out not just for its novel approach as a Layer 1 Web3 multi-chain aggregator but also for its ongoing presale, which is already in its 11th stage.

This isn’t just another coin; Qubetics aims to solve real-life issues that many other cryptocurrencies have yet to tackle effectively, making it a compelling choice for investors looking for something fresh. 1. Qubetics ($TICS) If you haven’t heard about Qubetics yet, you’re in for a treat. This crypto is not just another addition to the market; it’s the world’s first web3 aggregator designed to simplify and enhance the user experience across multiple chains. With its current presale in the 11th stage, Qubetics has already sold over 261 million tokens, raising more than $4.2 million—a fantastic feat in the crypto space. One of the standout features of Qubetics is its Decentralised VPN application. Imagine a small business owner who needs to protect sensitive customer data while working from a coffee shop. With Qubetics’ Decentralised VPN, they can securely access company resources without risking data breaches. Or consider a freelancer who wants to browse the web safely from various locations. This application enables them to stay anonymous, ensuring their online activities remain private. Why did this coin make it to this list? Analysts are predicting a significant price surge for $TICS, potentially reaching between $10 and $15 after the mainnet launch. This makes Qubetics not just a coin to buy but a strategic investment. If you’re considering a stake, even an investment of $7,500 could yield substantial returns as the presale momentum builds. 2. Bitcoin (BTC) Let’s kick things off with the king of cryptocurrencies—Bitcoin. This digital gold has been the go-to for investors since its inception. As of December 2024, Bitcoin shows strong signs of recovery, with analysts projecting a bullish trend as institutional adoption continues to grow. The recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs has also sparked renewed interest, pushing its price back into the spotlight. Bitcoin’s robust network and first-mover advantage keep it at the forefront of the crypto market. Additionally, its scarcity—only 21 million coins will ever exist—adds to its allure as an inflation hedge. Many investors view Bitcoin as a store of value, akin to gold, especially in uncertain economic times. Why did this coin make it to this list? Simply put, Bitcoin remains a safe bet for anyone looking to invest in cryptocurrencies. Its historical resilience and ongoing developments make it a staple in any investor’s portfolio. If you put in $7,500, you’re likely to see profits as the market continues to grow. 3. Ethereum (ETH) Next up is Ethereum, the backbone of decentralised applications (dApps) and smart contracts. With the recent transition to Ethereum 2.0, the network has become more efficient, with lower gas fees and faster transaction times. As developers flock to build on its platform, Ethereum’s utility continues to expand, solidifying its position as a leading cryptocurrency. What’s exciting about Ethereum is its upcoming upgrades aimed at improving scalability and security. With the rise of DeFi (Decentralised Finance) and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), Ethereum is at the heart of these innovations, attracting massive investment flows. Why did this coin make it to this list? Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency; it’s a platform for innovation. Its potential for growth is immense, making it a must-have for any investor. Investing $7,500 in Ethereum can yield significant returns, especially as more projects launch on its blockchain. 4. Solana (SOL) Don’t sleep on Solana! This blockchain has been making headlines for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low fees. With a focus on scalability, Solana has become a favoured choice for developers looking to launch their dApps quickly and efficiently. As of now, Solana is seeing increased adoption in the NFT space and gaming, which are two of the hottest sectors in crypto right now. The growing ecosystem around Solana, including partnerships with major companies and projects, showcases its potential. With the backing of prominent investors, Solana is positioning itself as a formidable competitor to Ethereum. Why did this coin make it to this list? Solana’s rapid growth and innovative approach make it a top contender. Its ability to handle thousands of transactions per second is a game-changer. A $7,500 investment in Solana could lead to impressive gains as its ecosystem continues to thrive. 5. Cardano (ADA) Finally, we have Cardano—often dubbed the “Ethereum killer.” Cardano is known for its strong focus on security and sustainability, making it a preferred choice for institutions. Its recent upgrades have enhanced its smart contract capabilities, attracting a variety of projects to its platform. Cardano’s unique approach, using a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, sets it apart from other blockchains. This not only reduces energy consumption but also positions Cardano as a forward-thinking cryptocurrency that prioritises environmental sustainability. Why did this coin make it to this list? Cardano’s solid fundamentals and commitment to innovation make it a wise investment choice. As the market matures, a $7,500 investment in Cardano could yield significant returns, especially with its growing ecosystem of dApps.

Tokens are available at $0.0282 each in the 10th stage, with a 10% price increase anticipated in the 11th stage. This presents a timely opportunity for those looking to invest before the price hike. Investment Example: An investment of $45,900 at the current price of $0.0282 per token would acquire approximately 1,628,369 $TICS tokens. If the token reaches $0.25 by the presale’s end, this investment could be worth around $407,092, yielding a return on investment (ROI) of 783%. Should the token achieve $1 post-presale, the value could rise to $1,628,369, reflecting an ROI of 3,434%. At $5, the investment’s value could soar to $8,141,845, marking an ROI of 17,571%. And if $TICS reaches $15 after the mainnet launch, the investment could be valued at $24,425,535, an astounding ROI of 52,912%. Near Protocol’s Recent Developments Near Protocol has been making headlines with its impressive performance. The platform’s TVL has surpassed $299 million, indicating growing confidence among investors. Additionally, Near Protocol has broken out of a symmetrical triangle pattern, suggesting a potential price rally towards the $8.31 resistance zone. These developments highlight Near Protocol’s commitment to scalability and decentralisation, positioning it as a formidable player in the blockchain space. SUI’s Performance and Challenges SUI has recently experienced significant growth, with its native token recording a monthly surge of over 95%. However, the network faced a notable setback on November 21, 2024, when block production halted for more than an hour due to issues with certain validators.

In a Telegram post from the Novosibirsk Oblast’s Prosecution Service , a spokesperson said the unnamed man was a lawmaker for the Krivodanovsky Rural Council in the Novosibirsk Oblast. Siberian Lawmaker ‘Caused Large-scale Damage to Power Grid’ The prosecutor’s office said it had charged the lawmaker under Article 165 of the Russian Criminal Code. The article pertains to “causing property damage by deception on an especially large scale.” Source: Novosibirsk Oblast’s Prosecution Service The spokesperson claimed the lawmaker mined an unnamed coin from June 2022 to June 2023. He reportedly did so without obtaining a permit from JSC RES, the state-run Novosibirsk-based power provider. Investigators said the man “bought” a range of crypto mining equipment from online vendors. They said he installed the equipment in a garage in the village of Krivodanovka. They added that he used an “unauthorized connection” with “power receiving devices.” Prosecutors explained that the man connected his equipment to the grid using “piercing clamps.” He reportedly connected these to “an overhead line on an electric pole” that ran “to an electrical substation” near the garage. Source: Novosibirsk Oblast’s Prosecution Service Prosecutors added that they had confiscated 16 crypto mining rigs from the garage. In total, they said they had seized crypto mining hardware worth over $11,300. The man stole electricity worth some $61,350 to power his rigs, they added. The prosecution service has since filed its case with a branch of the Novosibirsk District Court. If he is convicted, the spokesperson added, “the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation provides for a punishment of imprisonment for up to five years.” Source: Novosibirsk Oblast’s Prosecution Service ETH Focus?

37193234,https://coinpedia.org/?p=388896,1733281160,Solana Price Prediction For December 4,"The post Solana Price Prediction For December 4 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Solana (SOL) is currently up by more than three percent and is trading close to the $240 levels. The recent price increase comes after Grayscale Investments filed with the SEC to convert its Grayscale Solana Trust into a spot ETF. Other asset managers, like VanEck, 21Shares, Canary Capital, and Bitwise Asset Management, have also filed for spot Solana ETFs. Key Resistance and Price Targets for Solana Solana has recently completed a correction with an ABC structure, where the price has already dipped into the support zone. This correction seems to be nearing its end, with the potential for Solana to reverse and start moving upwards again. The current price structure suggests that wave five of the correction could be complete. The next significant resistance level for Solana is around $246. If the price breaks through this level, the next major target will be $260. However, a breakout above $260 could push Solana towards its next resistance point at $313. Short-Term Support Levels to Watch If Solana faces a pullback, the initial support zone to watch is between $232 and $233. If the price breaks below this level, the next support areas to consider are $222 and $205. Should Solana break above $246, it will likely turn into new support, leading to a bullish continuation. Impact of Bitcoin and Ethereum on Solana’s Price Movement Solana’s price action tends to follow the market trends of Bitcoin and Ethereum. If Bitcoin and Ethereum experience a significant price movement, Solana is likely to mirror that trend. Therefore, monitoring the movements of these major cryptocurrencies will be crucial for predicting Solana’s next moves. Conclusion There’s a chance that Solana could form a bull flag pattern and break out. If it does, it could test higher levels, possibly around Christmas or early in the new year. With the upcoming changes in crypto regulation, there’s a good chance Solana could make a significant move, with some analysts predicting it could reach $300 or even $400.",POSITIVE,SOL,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/solana-price-prediction-for-december-4/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Donald vs Israel (DONISRA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONISRA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Donald vs Israel can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald vs Israel could become the next viral memecoin. Donald vs Israel launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Donald vs Israel on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald vs Israel by entering its contract address – CKYA6Q1KcWsSJyXgFKwyNXyTAjHD1dRPKTDD2FTUFryn – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONISRA.

Roger Ver, who was arrested in Barcelona in April 2024, has now filed a motion to dismiss the indictment. He was indicted on eight counts by the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California for evading over $48 million in taxes, reports FOX Business . The charges followed after the former CEO of Bitcoin.com underreported his Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings and other assets in 2014. Now, his lawyers argue that the indictment was influenced by government bias. Roger Ver’s motion to dismiss Ver’s attorneys claim that the Department of Justice inappropriately accessed confidential attorney-client communications and did not reveal key evidence to the grand jury. Ver claims he did what any reasonable person would do, following professional advice based on the limited regulatory guidance available at the time regarding cryptocurrencies. You might also like: Tron has surged 104% in a day and hit a new all-time high Ver stated that he anticipated being a political target for the IRS after his expatriation, claiming his actions were in accordance with the law. Furthermore, the defense team states that only after Ver’s move to Spain did the IRS start to issue clear directions on crypto-taxes. Only then could a fair market valuation for his Bitcoin holdings be applied, which was difficult to determine due to the asset’s low liquidity and high volatility at the time. The indictment, which was unsealed earlier this year by the U.S Department of Justice, reads , “ The indictment..alleges that by June 2017, Ver’s two companies continued to own approximately 70,000 bitcoins. He was also allegedly required to pay a tax – referred to as an “exit tax” – on those capital gains. By Feb. 4, 2014, Ver and his companies allegedly owned approximately 131,000 bitcoins that traded on several large exchanges for around $871 each. MemoryDealers and Agilestar allegedly held approximately 73,000 of those bitcoins.” The case has attracted a lot of attention from the crypto community, with many condemning the U.S. DOJ for its enforcement-first approach to digital assets, especially under the Biden government which has faced criticism for its perceived ‘ anti-crypto ‘ stance. Critics like Robert Barnes , a civil rights attorney who supports Ver’s case, believe the charges represent selective enforcement. “This is another example of lawfare against the crypto industry, targeting individuals based on political considerations rather than clear evidence of wrongdoing,” said Barnes.

Legal Expert Breaks Down Why RLUSD Launch Will Fuel XRP Growth appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple is preparing to launch a new stablecoin, RLUSD, which is expected to be backed by the U.S. dollar. This new token is anticipated to receive regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) soon. The introduction of RLUSD could give Ripple a new way to offer liquidity to its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) partners, boosting its working capital. The stablecoin, RLUSD, is expected to play a key role in Ripple’s global payment solutions, helping improve liquidity and efficiency for partners using Ripple’s ODL service. The launch is being closely watched by the XRP Army, who are hopeful that this move will further drive the adoption of Ripple’s technology. How Will RLUSD Affect XRP’s Value? There is speculation around how the launch of RLUSD will affect the value of XRP. Pro-XRP lawyer Fred Rispoli shared his thoughts, explaining that any increase in the usage of a blockchain network can lead to an increase in the value of its native token. He pointed to the example of Bitcoin, where the network’s value is driven by its usage, scarcity, and resistance to censorship. Rispoli said that the value of a blockchain is tied to its adoption and use, not just the supply cap, noting that increased network activity generally results in higher token value. When asked for further clarification on why using the XRPL (Ripple’s ledger) would increase XRP’s value, Rispoli explained that the value of Bitcoin rises due to its use as a scarce and secure form of money. He also said that while the total supply of both Bitcoin and XRP could theoretically be changed in the future, the focus should remain on how the networks are used and the value that usage brings to the ecosystem.",POSITIVE,XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-to-soar-more-legal-expert-breaks-down-why-rlusd-launch-will-fuel-xrp-growth/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

However, with the recent growth of the Solana ecosystem and its native token, firms appear to be filing for or hoping to attach ETFs to the token. Grayscale Spot Solana ETF According to Grayscale’s recent filing, the firm believes that turning its existing Solana Trust into a spot SOL Exchange-Traded Product (ETP), similar to its Bitcoin Trust, would provide investors with a safer and more secure way to invest in Solana (SOL). This move would enable trading on a regulated national securities exchange, making access to the cryptocurrency easier and more reliable. The Grayscale Solana Trust is the largest trust of its kind, currently standing out as the leading Solana (SOL) investment fund by assets under management. According to the data, the firm holds an impressive $134.2 million worth of SOL, which represents nearly 0.1% of SOL’s overall circulating supply. However, the crypto community is expecting quicker approval, as Gensler and his team are set to step down in January 2025. A potential approval of the SOL ETF would make it the United States next crypto-product ETF after BTC and ETH. Solana (SOL) Current Price Momentum Following this filing, the SOL price jumped by 7% and is currently trading near $240. Meanwhile, its trading volume over the past 24 hours surged by 20%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | SOL,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/grayscale-files-for-spot-solana-etf-sol-price-spikes/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

In addition to Bitcoin, which is currently teasing the $100k level, Ripple’s XRP is creating a price surge: the altcoin is enjoying a solid 107% gain in the last week, data from Coingecko shows. Related Reading: Cardano To Hit $10? Analyst Thinks It’s Happening This Cycle To fully understand XRP’s surge, we must take a step back to its price during the November 5th elections and its value at the start of the year. Immediately after Donald Trump won, the coin was off to a sluggish start, trading at $1.50 levels. But at the beginning of the year, it was trading at $0.61, reflecting a 350% increase. Thanks to XRP’s bullish movement, Tether has been dethroned from the top cryptos in terms of market caps. But if you think that Ripple’s XRP momentum is about to end, well – think again. According to Crypto Michael, a market psychologist, the altcoin is still trading below its potential peak, and he expects a bigger “FOMO” frenzy soon. The craziest thing about this XRP rally is that it still hasn’t broken its ATH Imagine what will happen when it breaks ATH and enters price discovery They laughed at me when I called for a major breakout back at $0.5 I think it’s time you stopped underestimating this coin — Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) December 2, 2024 Ripple’s XRP Is Having A Moment XRP is arguably the hottest crypto right now, and its gains outperform those of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Today, XRP is trading at around $2.73, consolidating its price above $2.50. Last month, its price was hovering near the $0.60 level just before the elections, reflecting a growth of over 400% in just one month. XRP’s thrilling price rally has attracted considerable attention from holders, traders, market analysts, and psychologists. Crypto Michael, who regularly shares his bullish calls on XRP, has contributed his insights on the current market action. In a Twitter/X post, he shared that the token’s wild days aren’t over. Altcoin To Break ATH And Enter ‘Price Discovery’ In the same Twitter/X post that garnered over 72k views, Crypto Michael argued that XRP’s current rally hasn’t broken its all-time high. He added that if XRP breaks out and hits another all-time high, it enters its price discovery, and all bets are off.

The price hit a range high of $2.82 before hitting a reverse. However, over the last day, the price has broken through significant resistance levels, first surpassing the $2 mark and then pushing above the $2.50 level. Now, the focus is on the $2.75 to $3 range. The $3 level is particularly important, as it marks a major resistance area on the chart. Once XRP breaks through this level, the next target is the all-time high around $3.30, which is becoming increasingly likely given the current price action. Short-Term Price Action However, if the price experiences any short-term pullbacks, key support levels should come into play. For instance, if there’s a dip, the altcoin can expect strong support at the $2.50 level, as this was a previous resistance point. XRP has been showing repeated patterns of brief pullbacks followed by upward movement, similar to what we’ve seen in the past. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, if the price continues to fall further, $2 is another level to watch, as it could act as a strong area of support as well. These support zones are crucial to monitor, as any dips toward these levels could present buying opportunities for those looking to enter or add to their positions. Looking at the Bigger Picture From a larger time frame perspective, the bullish trend remains intact, and we’re getting closer to an all-time high breakout. While short-term pullbacks and volatility are common in any bull market, it’s important not to be discouraged by these movements. The bigger picture for XRP remains bullish, and the potential for new all-time highs is on the horizon. So, even if there are some minor retracements or short-term corrections, the long-term outlook remains positive.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-december-4/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

With so many options, finding the best altcoin to invest today can feel overwhelming. Cardano is refining its blockchain with new governance features, Immutable X is reshaping NFT gaming, and Qubetics ($TICS) is stepping in with a groundbreaking Web3 aggregated chain. While each has its strengths, Qubetics is carving out a unique path by tackling real-world problems head-on. Unlike earlier projects, Qubetics is redefining how blockchains interact, ensuring seamless communication between networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Its ongoing presale is grabbing attention, with over 260 million $TICS tokens sold already. Let’s dive into what sets these three projects apart and why Qubetics could be the standout choice for the future. Qubetics Leading Blockchain Interoperability: A Unified Approach with Web3 Aggregated Chain One of the biggest hurdles in blockchain today is the lack of compatibility between networks, leaving businesses and developers struggling to connect various platforms. Qubetics ($TICS) solves this issue with its Web3 aggregated chain , integrating EVM, Wasm, and Bitcoin chains into a seamless and unified ecosystem. This breakthrough enhances interoperability, allowing different blockchains to communicate effortlessly. For example, a healthcare company can securely share patient data across blockchains like Ethereum and Solana without compatibility barriers. Similarly, financial institutions can optimise cross-border settlements using Qubetics’ integrated framework, avoiding the inefficiencies of siloed systems. This integration unlocks new opportunities for businesses and developers while driving adoption of decentralised technologies. By focusing on interoperability, Qubetics isn’t just connecting chains; it’s creating a collaborative environment for innovation. Presale Performance That Grabs Attention The $TICS presale is in its 11th stage, with over 261 million tokens sold to more than 5,900 holders, raising $4.2 million. At $0.0282 per token, this stage offers significant potential, with a 10% price surge expected soon. Analysts anticipate extraordinary returns for Qubetics ($TICS). By the end of the presale, $TICS is expected to reach $0.25, offering a 783% ROI. Post-presale, predictions place its value at $1 (3,434% ROI) and $5 (17,571% ROI), with a remarkable $15 forecasted after the mainnet launch, equating to an astonishing 52,912% ROI. For instance, an investment of $9,800 at the current price of $0.0282 could potentially grow to $87,238 at $0.25, $336,860 at $1, and an incredible $5,178,960 if $TICS reaches $15. If you’re considering joining this promising project, watch this video or visit the Qubetics website for more details. Cardano’s Latest Updates and Goals Cardano is no stranger to the spotlight. The project has been gaining attention due to its impressive 213% monthly price increase, with analysts predicting a future value of $10 for ADA. These gains reflect its growing adoption and strong technical fundamentals. Its focus on decentralisation and governance is evident with its upcoming “Voltaire” upgrade, which aims to bring user-powered decision-making into the network. However, regulatory concerns persist. The SEC’s lawsuit against Binance, which also implicated ADA as a security, raised red flags in 2023, leading to price volatility. Immutable X Revolutionising NFT Gaming Immutable X continues to position itself as a leader in the NFT gaming sector. With partnerships like the one with GameStop to launch an NFT marketplace , the platform is delivering efficient and scalable solutions for gaming enthusiasts. Additionally, its Golden Guardians Survivor NFT collection has been making waves in the crypto community. Yet, recent challenges, such as compromised social media accounts, have underlined the importance of robust security measures. Final Thoughts Cardano and Immutable X are pushing boundaries in governance and gaming, but Qubetics is carving a niche with its interoperability solutions. The ongoing $TICS presale offers a unique opportunity for those looking to invest in a forward-thinking project with significant ROI potential. As always, explore your options and research before making investment decisions.

37191355,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51270,1733276705,"Qubetics Presale Phase 11: Unlock 52,912% ROI Potential! Ethereum’s $333M ETF Inflows and Monero’s Privacy Edge Lead Crypto Headlines","What’s new in the crypto world? Ethereum has seen a surge in institutional interest, with ETF inflows reaching $333 million, fuelling optimism for decentralised finance. On the other hand, Monero is making waves with its focus on privacy but is facing potential regulatory challenges in Brazil. The crypto world keeps proving it’s never short on excitement or surprises. Amid these developments, a fresh contender is shaking things up: Qubetics ($TICS) . Unlike others, Qubetics aims to solve interoperability issues that hinder blockchain growth. Its ongoing presale offers a chance to invest early in what could be a transformative Web3 project, with potential returns of up to 52,912%. Qubetics Is Unlocking Blockchain Interoperability Qubetics is setting itself apart by tackling a major pain point: interoperability. Many blockchains operate in isolation, making it difficult for users and businesses to transfer assets or share data across networks. Qubetics solves this by functioning as a Web3 aggregator , uniting major blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana. This seamless interaction unlocks the full potential of decentralised technologies. Picture a logistics company using multiple blockchain networks to track global shipments. Before Qubetics, transferring shipment data between these chains was complicated and inefficient. With Qubetics’ interoperability features, the company can streamline its operations, improving accuracy and reducing costs. Similarly, individual investors who manage assets on different chains can unify them in one system, saving time and hassle. Currently, the Qubetics presale is in its 11th stage, with over 261 million $TICS tokens sold to 5,900+ holders, raising more than $4.2 million. Tokens are priced at $0.0282, with a 10% price increase expected in the next stage. Here’s what analysts predict: $TICS at $0.25 by the presale’s end offers a 783% ROI. $TICS at $1 post-presale yields 3,434%. $TICS at $15 after mainnet launch projects a staggering 52,912% ROI. For example, a $5700 investment at $0.0282 could grow to over $3,000,000. These numbers show why investors are eyeing Qubetics as one of the best cryptos to buy this week. If you want more information about this project, you can watch this video . Ethereum Gains Traction with Institutional Investors Ethereum remains a dominant force in the crypto space. Recent reports highlight $333 million in inflows into Ethereum ETFs, showcasing growing interest from institutional investors. Experts attribute this to renewed optimism around decentralised finance and the upcoming regulatory clarity in the United States. Ethereum has also seen a significant increase in DeFi activity, with total value locked (TVL) surging 12% over the past month to $50 billion. Despite a minor price dip of 3%, Ethereum remains a favourite among investors. Over the last month, it gained 30%, and analysts believe that another bull run like 2021 could send Ethereum to new heights. For long-term holders, Ethereum’s utility in DeFi and its scalability improvements with Ethereum 2.0 make it one of the best cryptos to buy this week. Monero Fights for Privacy in a Changing Regulatory Climate Monero (XMR) is known as the go-to cryptocurrency for privacy. Its ability to mask transaction details has made it popular, but it’s also attracted regulatory challenges. Recently, Brazil’s Central Bank proposed a ban on privacy coins like Monero. Despite this, Monero has been holding steady, trading at $166.74. It saw a daily high of $169.03 and a low of $160.52. However, Monero faces an uphill battle to gain mainstream acceptance due to increased regulatory scrutiny. For those prioritising anonymity, Monero remains unmatched. Its consistent performance and dedicated community make it a niche but significant player in the crypto market. While regulatory hurdles persist, Monero’s focus on privacy ensures its relevance, especially for users looking for secure, anonymous transactions. Conclusion Qubetics, Ethereum, and Monero each bring something unique to the table. Qubetics shines with its interoperability and presale potential, offering real-world solutions that many investors find compelling. Ethereum’s DeFi growth and institutional backing keep it at the forefront, while Monero’s privacy features cater to those prioritising anonymity. For those looking to diversify their portfolios with the best cryptos to buy this week, Qubetics offers an exciting opportunity to capitalise on its presale and long-term growth.

37190959,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=622341,1733275853,"Foundry, the world’s largest Bitcoin mining pool, cuts 60% of the workforce amid restructuring","Foundry, the world’s largest Bitcoin mining pool, has sent more than 60% of its staff packing today. The company released some of its local and international employees, affecting several teams, including the ASIC repair and hardware teams. The mining pool operations, firmware team, and self-mining department remained partially intact. Still, a representative from Digital Currency Group (DCG) has clarified that the layoffs affected 16% of Foundry’s U.S. employees and a small team in India. Conflicting information is currently being reported regarding this story. Familiar sources state that the company’s move to lay off staff is strategic as it aims to improve the main revenue streams. The digital currency group shareholder letter points to Foundry’s race to earn $80 million in revenue from its self-mining business for 2024. Foundry BTC mining pool accounts for 30% of the Bitcoin network’s total hashrate Foundry boasts of several business lines. One of its most significant lines is the mining pool, which accounts for 30% of the network’s total hashrate . The firm has always been the pool of choice for institutional-scale and public Bitcoin mining firms incorporated in the US. Foundry’s other significant business lines include self-mining, custom hardware, decentralized AI infrastructure, ASIC repairs, firmware, and site operations across other Bitcoin mining and general compute verticals. It launched some revenue streams in 2022 after Genesis, a subsidiary of their shared parent company, Digital Currency Group, collapsed. While most departments were affected by the layoffs, the firm’s site operations, which control and oversee Bitcoin mining firms, remain in place. There are speculations that Foundry is planning to sell, but only time will prove this. DCG restructures by moving Foundry employees to Yuma and resolving Genesis disputes Foundry had moved nearly 20 workers to Yuma, a new subsidiary under Digital Currency Group. Yuma, a decentralized AI startup, has roots in Foundry and is supported by investments through Foundry’s AI-focused division, Bittensor . The startup is run in an acting capacity by Barry Silbert, the DCG CEO. The Foundry was registered in 2017 under the wings of DCG and has often given more competitive mining pool fee rates. Its offers are always enticing, sometimes extending 0% fees to its most prominent clients. Around 2020 and 2021, the firm introduced ASIC-backed loans. These layoffs are a strategy for the DCG to repair its shredded empire. Genesis, which was DCG pride, went bankrupt after FTX’s implosion. Following the bankruptcy period, DCG spent vast dollars to help Genesis pay its creditors. However, Genesis initiated a legal dispute, claiming that DCG owed its creditors around a $1.7 billion loan. The legal dispute was solved in August, with DCG committing to pay Genesis $324.5 million in cash and $158 million in cryptocurrencies.

37190958,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=621892,1733275743,Bitcoin mining proposed as a solution to UK wind energy waste,"CEO and Chairman of Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital, Fred Thiel, has called for grid operators and renewable asset owners to use Bitcoin mining to manage grid congestion due to excess energy. Thiel expressed this view in response to a recent report about excess energy being wasted by wind farms in the UK. According to Bloomberg ‘s report, the UK is paying £1 billion ($1.3 billion) in congestion costs to wind farms to turn off their operations because the grid cannot handle the excess output from the wind farms. According to reports, the UK has significantly increased its wind power generation capacity over the last few years, with its offshore wind fleet now up by 50% over the last five years and projected to double in the next five. Despite the massive increase in capacity meant to increase Britain’s reliance on renewable energy, its grid capacity has not expanded to match this supply. This has led to congestion issues, forcing the utility provider to pay some plants to turn off while paying others to turn on. Interestingly, the shutoff of wind farms, usually offshore and far away from cities, has invariably led to the turning on of gas plants closer to the demand centers. This is not the first time the UK operator will pay congestion costs, with the 1 billion this year even below the amount it paid in 2022. Experts say Bitcoin mining with excess energy will prevent waste Meanwhile, Thiel has criticized the energy waste and congestion costs, noting that Bitcoin mining could solve this problem. According to Thiel, adding Bitcoin mining is one of the ways to make renewable energy more economically viable. He observed that the IEA estimates that it would cost over $26 trillion to upgrade the grid for renewable energy transition by 2050, and consumers will be the ones to foot all these costs. However, Bitcoin mining could reduce the economic burden on these rate-payers. He said : “Grid operators and renewable asset owners must realize that adding large despatchable loads such as #bitcoin mining behind the meter at renewable energy sites is the only way to eliminate grid congestion and wasted energy.” The mining executive added that Marathon Digital optimally monetized its energy through Bitcoin mining. Marathon is one of the leading publicly listed mining companies and recently acquired Bitcoin using proceeds from convertible notes. Meanwhile, VanEck of digital assets research Matthew Sigel also criticized what he termed a “waste of power,” noting that all the excess energy could be used to mine Bitcoin. Bitcoin mining gains adoption for managing grid capacity Despite UK energy providers’ failure to consider Bitcoin mining for managing grid congestion, many other entities are exploring it for that purpose. In Switzerland, the Bern region recently approved a proposal to evaluate how Bitcoin mining can stabilize the power grid by utilizing surplus energy. The Grand Council of Bern , the region’s parliament, voted 85 – 46 on the proposal, confirming the broad support for the idea within the region. With the approval, the government will now assess whether to integrate Bitcoin mining into its energy strategy. Meanwhile, Deutsche Telekom is also piloting a Bitcoin mining scheme in Germany focused on using surplus renewable energy to power Bitcoin mining operations. The pilot program intends to lay the groundwork for the large-scale implementation of Bitcoin mining for load balancing within the energy grid. With more entities exploring the use of Bitcoin mining for managing renewable energy fluctuations, the industry might have found a new use case for countries pursuing renewable energy alternatives for power generation.

He admitted, “You were right, I was wrong. Well done! Dinosaurs still roam the earth.” Pal also highlighted the community’s challenges, remarking that they had “walked through hell to get here.” The financial expert also recalled the hardships endured during the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple in 2020. This legal action led to XRP being delisted from prominent exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance US, and Bitstamp. While trading was suspended, users could still hold, deposit, and withdraw XRP. Pal noted that he retained some XRP during that turbulent period, describing it as the “delisting times.” Dear $XRP Jedi Warriors… You were right, I was wrong. Well done! Dinosaurs still roam the earth I just want everyone to make $$ and you guys have walked through hell to get here. I still own some XRP from the delisting but you guys/girls deserve everything. — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) December 1, 2024 Earlier in the year, Pal had criticized XRP and ADA, suggesting they had become “cults” and advising investors to avoid them. However, the recent market developments compelled him to revise his stance, particularly as XRP’s price climbed past $1 and then surged to over $2. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple Unlocks One Billion XRP Amid Market Rally The price rally coincided with a significant transaction by Ripple. Data from Whale Alert, a platform that tracks large cryptocurrency transfers, revealed that Ripple released one billion XRP tokens from escrow on December 1. At the current market value, this amounted to over $2 billion. XRP’s remarkable performance has been particularly notable since November 24, when the token traded above $1. Since then, XRP has experienced an impressive 84.78% increase, reaching $2.73 at the time of writing. The rally solidified XRP’s position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a spot it had not held in years. The timing of Ripple’s escrow release, coupled with XRP’s price surge, has sparked interest among market analysts and the broader crypto community. This significant development comes as Ripple continues to expand its presence in global payment solutions and reinforces the resilience of XRP supporters despite past challenges. A Shift in Perception Pal’s acknowledgment marks a turning point in his view of XRP, signaling broader recognition of the cryptocurrency’s potential. As the market evolves, dedicated communities like XRP’s remain a testament to the influence of collective conviction in the crypto landscape.

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-pepe-sanpepe-solana-memecoin-to-rally-19000-ahead-of-first-exchange-listing-as-shib-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

From quirky beginnings as internet jokes to skyrocketing investment opportunities, these coins have flipped the script on what a cryptocurrency can be. As 2024 wraps up, the race is on to spot the next big winner in this meme-powered gold rush. Standing out in this vibrant landscape is BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a fresh contender with explosive potential and innovative features. But the fun doesn’t stop there. Turbo, Memecoin, and Baby Doge Coin are also heating up the charts, each with its unique charm and promise of massive returns. Let’s dive into the best meme coin presales with 100x potential and see why these picks are turning heads. 1. BTFD Coin If you’re hunting for the best meme coin presales with 100x potential, BTFD Coin should be at the top of your list. Launched on November 26, 2024, it entered the market with a price of $0.000004 per coin. In just one week, it’s surged to $0.000058 in its sixth presale stage, raising over $700,000 and selling more than 18 billion coins. These numbers aren’t just impressive—they’re game-changing. BTFD’s appeal goes beyond its numbers. Its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, BTFD Bull Run, lets users earn tokens through interactive challenges. It’s fun, engaging, and, most importantly, profitable. Add to this a staking program with a staggering 90% Annual Percentage Yield (APY) , and you’ve got a coin that’s catering to gamers, casual investors, and hardcore crypto enthusiasts alike. The backbone of BTFD’s momentum is its community, the “Bulls Squad.” With over 1,700 members rallying behind the coin, it’s more than just a cryptocurrency—it’s a movement. Why did this coin make it to this list? BTFD Coin’s presale performance and long-term potential are unmatched. A $4,800 investment at the current presale price could turn into $49,655 when the coin hits its post-presale listing price of $0.0006. If you missed Dogecoin or Shiba Inu, this could be your second chance. 2. Turbo Turbo isn’t just a meme coin—it’s a race car in crypto form. Born out of a joke about speed and flash, Turbo has quickly gained a loyal following among adrenaline junkies and meme enthusiasts alike. With a clever marketing campaign that blends humour with high-octane imagery, Turbo has carved out a unique niche in the meme coin space. But this isn’t just a gimmick. Turbo’s developers have incorporated a dynamic transaction fee system that adjusts based on trading volume. This mechanism not only discourages pump-and-dump schemes but also rewards long-term holders with passive gains. Its upcoming NFT collection, “TurboCharged,” promises to blend the worlds of gaming and digital art, making it a coin that’s as versatile as it is entertaining. Why did this coin make it to this list? Turbo’s combination of humour, innovation, and community focus makes it one of the best meme coin presales with 100x potential. Its clever approach to tokenomics and strong branding set it apart in a crowded market. 3. Memecoin Sometimes, simplicity is genius. Memecoin doesn’t try to overcomplicate things—it’s a coin that’s all about memes, pure and simple. This straightforward approach has struck a chord with investors who are tired of overhyped promises and just want to have fun. Memecoin’s charm lies in its transparency. The developers have committed to a no-nonsense roadmap, focusing on community growth and steady price appreciation. With regular “Meme Wars” on social media, the coin has created an interactive platform for its users, making the investment experience as entertaining as it is rewarding. Why did this coin make it to this list? Memecoin is proof that you don’t need complex features to succeed in the meme coin market. Its community-first approach and consistent growth make it a strong contender among the best meme coin presales with 100x potential. 4. Baby Doge Coin Baby Doge Coin has been riding the coattails of its older sibling, Dogecoin, but it’s quickly making a name for itself. Launched as a “cuter and faster” alternative, Baby Doge has captured the hearts of investors with its playful branding and impressive growth metrics. The coin uses a deflationary model, which burns tokens with every transaction, reducing supply and driving up demand. This approach has proven effective, with Baby Doge seeing a 300% increase in its market cap over the past three months. Its charitable initiatives, which include donations to animal shelters, add an extra layer of appeal for socially conscious investors. Why did this coin make it to this list? Baby Doge Coin’s rapid growth, combined with its unique blend of humour and heart, makes it one of the best meme coin presales with 100x potential. It’s a feel-good investment with serious upside. Conclusion The meme coin market is brimming with opportunities, but not all coins are created equal. BTFD Coin stands out for its explosive presale growth, innovative features, and strong community backing. Turbo’s high-octane branding and smart tokenomics make it a unique entry, while Memecoin’s simplicity and community focus prove that sometimes less is more. Baby Doge Coin, with its deflationary model and charitable initiatives, rounds out the list as a coin that’s as heartwarming as it is profitable. If you’re ready to dive into the world of meme coins, now’s the time. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and take your first step towards potentially life-changing returns.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Rekt Capital tells his 518,000 followers on the social media platform X that Avalanche witnessed a strong November. “Avalanche performed a historically bullish monthly close above the light blue level of $38.57. Any dips [below $38.57] in the future would be a retest attempt, in a very similar fashion to the retests from Sept 2021 and March 2024 (green/orange circles).” Source: Rekt Capital/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that AVAX tends to rally after retesting $38.57 as support. Avalanche is trading at $51.14 at time of writing, up over 12% in the past day. Next up is Polkadot. The widely followed analyst says the 17th-largest crypto asset by market cap also recorded a “bullish monthly close” to reach a level last witnessed in April. “DOT is also showing very early signs of retesting this level [at around $8.61] into new support. DOT needs to continue doing this to enable further upside. Price stability at $8.61 = crucial.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Polkadot is trading at $10.24 at time of writing, up nearly 7% in the last 24 hours. As for Dogecoin, Rekt Capital notes the flagship memecoin has broken out from the upper boundary of an ascending triangle pattern that had formed on the daily time frame. In technical analysis, an ascending triangle breakout is considered bullish. “Any dips into the top of the pattern [at around the $0.43 level], if needed, would constitute a post-breakout retest to confirm the breakout.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Dogecoin is trading at $0.421.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Discover the latest meme coin rally as PEPE and SHIB dominate the crypto spotlight; learn about the emerging ERC-20 token poised to redefine the meme coin market. Table of Contents PEPE’s has a big jump, and SHIB stays strong The next ERC-20 to blow up will most likely be DTX Memecoins and market mood The meme coin madness is back, and everyone is getting excited again. In the spotlight, we have these meme coins as leaders, Pepe (PEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), two original meme coins that are definitely back with big rallies. While these household names still dominate the meme coin space, investors and analysts are discussing a new ERC-20 token that could be the next big winner. PEPE’s has a big jump, and SHIB stays strong Pepe , the Ethereum-based token that pays homage to the internet’s favorite Pepe the Frog, has been on a tear lately. PEPE is up 131% in the last month, driven by retail interest and whale activity. A significant development that got everyone’s attention was the withdrawal of 150 billion PEPE tokens worth nearly $3 million from Binance by one wallet. This enormous transfer initially caused some uncertainty, but many see it as a sign of growing confidence in PEPE’s long term. The coin’s recent move is a testament to its popularity among retail investors, thanks to its community-driven and viral nature. Not far behind, Shiba Inu is solidifying its position as a meme coin leader. SHIB has gone beyond its meme roots by adding DeFi applications, NFTs, and governance features to its ecosystem. These have kept the token relevant and attracted a loyal user and investor base. Despite its huge supply, SHIB has held up in price, with early 2025 projections of $0.0000093. SHIB’s ability to innovate while riding its existing popularity makes it a good option for long-term holders and speculators.

It has just hit $9.2 million in presale, and investors are showing big interest. DTX just entered its sixth round, and the price has been raised to $0.12. Early investors are already seeing significant gains of 500% because the initial price when DTX started was $0.02. DTX Exchange is launching its First Hybrid Leaderboard, which will combine the best centralized and decentralized exchanges to bring transparency and gamification to trading. Experts are predicting big growth for DTX Exchange . Some analysts say it could hit $4.5 by February 2025, a 4,500% gain for early investors. Now, rumors of a Binance listing in 2025 are surfacing, which could make it even bigger. With its upcoming Hybrid Leaderboard and strong community, DTX will be a significant player in the crypto space. Memecoins and market mood The comeback of PEPE and SHIB is a sign of the overall market’s risk appetite. These tokens, often criticized for having no intrinsic value, live on community, social media, and market sentiment. Remember, meme coins are highly volatile. They can give users huge short-term gains but also big losses. Analysts advise traders not to overexpose to this speculative asset class and to diversify their portfolio. The meme coin rally signifies a lively and exciting crypto market. Social media and community narratives will continue to shape the path of Pepe, Shiba Inu, and the new DTX Exchange token. As the anticipation grows, the market is waiting for meme coins to blow up. Whether it’s a token based on a new internet meme or a project using new tech, one thing is certain: the meme coin space is a wild west in crypto. Investors, be informed, be cautious, and remember that in the memecoin world, fortunes can change quickly. For more information, visit the DTX Website , buy presale , or join the DTX community .

37189192,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656492,1733272236,"Bitcoin Price Could ‘Easily Double’ In A Short Time, Predicts Hedge Fund CEO","In the latest episode of The Milk Road Show, Charles Edwards, founder of crypto hedge fund Capriole Investments, provided an in-depth analysis of Bitcoin’s current state, its future trajectory, and the potential conclusion of the traditional 4-year Bitcoin cycle. Edwards posits that Bitcoin’s journey to $100,000 could be the catalyst for an unprecedented price acceleration. He suggests that once this psychological and technical barrier is breached, Bitcoin could potentially double in value within weeks. Drawing parallels with gold’s recent performance, Edwards stated, “If you look at gold this year, it went up 33% in 16 weeks—that’s a $3.8 trillion move in a really old asset. For Bitcoin to go from $100K to $200K, that’s just $2 trillion on an asset that trades 24/7 and is more accessible globally.” He emphasizes that Bitcoin’s relatively smaller market capitalization compared to gold allows for more rapid price movements. Historically, after surpassing previous all-time highs, Bitcoin has experienced significant and swift appreciations, entering periods of price discovery where supply constraints can lead to vertical price increases. When Will Bitcoin Price Double? The $100,000 mark is not just a round number; it represents a significant resistance level due to several factors. Edwards highlighted the presence of a substantial sell wall at this price point, noting, “We have the biggest sell wall we’ve ever seen in the order books for Bitcoin at $100,00. I think just yeah once that’s cleared out, that’s when you know everyone who wanted to sell has sold and you have these really sharp rapid vertical price appreciation moves because there’s just no more supply left.” Related Reading: MicroStrategy Continues Bitcoin Buying Streak: 15,400 BTC Added This Monday Additionally, many investors who entered the market at lower prices may view $100,000 as an optimal point to realize profits, potentially creating selling pressure. However, Edwards remains optimistic that this barrier will be surpassed, especially within the next few months, given the seasonal strength observed in Bitcoin’s price movements during Q4 and Q1. “We are [at a point] in the cycle where we are seasonal and this is kind of like the optimal two to four month period, maybe a five to six month period every four years. After each Halving every four years, you have about 12 to 18 months where you get 90% to 95% of all the cycles returns out of every four years. So most of it happens in that one year alone. If you look at Q4 and Q1 that again is the majority of the returns […] once you have a strong monthly breakout above all time,” the hedge fund CEO stated. While Edwards is bullish on Bitcoin’s prospects, he cautions investors about the inherent volatility of the market. He pointed out that corrections of 20% to 30% are normal during bull markets and that investors should be prepared for such fluctuations. “It’s normal to have 30% drawdowns every few months in a Bitcoin bull market,” he noted. Factors such as increasing leverage in the market could exacerbate price swings. Edwards mentioned that if leverage and funding rates continue to rise without chipping away at the existing sell wall, Bitcoin could revisit lower support levels, potentially around $80,000. However, he emphasizes that such volatility is a natural part of Bitcoin’s growth cycle and not necessarily indicative of a long-term downturn. The End Of The Traditional 4-Year Cycle? A significant point of discussion was whether the traditional 4-year cycle, largely driven by the halving events, is reaching its conclusion. Edwards believes that as Bitcoin matures and integrates more deeply with traditional financial systems, the impact of the halving on market cycles will diminish. “As Bitcoin’s inflation rate decreases and it becomes more integrated with traditional finance, the four-year halving cycles may become less impactful. The large 80% drawdowns we’ve seen in the past might not happen in future cycles,” he stated. This maturation process could lead to more stable growth patterns and reduced volatility. Edwards suggests that future cycles may see shallower corrections, possibly around 60% rather than the dramatic declines of previous years. Related Reading: Data Shows Selling Pressure Mounts On Bitcoin: Is The Bull Run at Risk? Notably, several potential catalysts could propel Bitcoin’s price to unprecedented levels. Edwards mentioned the possibility of the US government establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve under President-elect Donald Trump. While he estimates the probability of this occurring in 2025 to be around 30%, he acknowledges that such an event would be a game-changer. “Assuming [the U.S. government] doesn’t sell their existing holdings is great, but it’s probably not going to help the cycle a lot. Actively buying Bitcoin could be a game-changer,” he remarked. Corporate adoption is another significant factor. The potential for major corporations to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets could drive substantial demand. Edwards highlighted the upcoming vote by Microsoft on this matter, saying, “Let’s hope it’s Microsoft [on December 10].” Furthermore, the success of spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) has opened the doors for institutional investors. The sustained demand from ETFs has been absorbing Bitcoin supply steadily. Edwards observed, “The ETFs have just been sucking Bitcoin out of the system ferociously.” Bitcoin Price Predictions Edwards provided a base and an optimistic scenario for the Bitcoin price in this cycle. He stated, “I’d be surprised if we don’t get to $140,000.” This base case assumes steady market conditions without any extraordinary positive events. In a more optimistic scenario, he believes Bitcoin could reach $200,000, especially if significant catalysts, such as government or corporate adoption, materialize. “We could easily get to $200,000. Once we clear those all-time highs, Bitcoin does multiples very quickly,” he explained. He concluded: “”Once we’re above $100,000, people who aren’t in Bitcoin just cannot comprehend Bitcoin above $100,000 […] That’s when you see the real switch flick and the flows happen.” At press time, BTC traded at $94,814.

Tron ( TRX ), a cryptocurrency with a surging $36 billion in market capitalization, has seen a massive trading day with $10 billion in trading volume or an inc rease of almost 500%. The token price also soared by 95%, from $0.21 to $0.43 in a day at the time of writing. The token released for blockchain -based operating systems has recorded a news all-time high of $0.4, surpassing the June 2018 peak, and the price also skyrocketed to 157% in just one month. 1 Day TRX price chart, October 26 – December 04, 2024 | Source: crypto.news As a blockchain with smart contract functions, they record high transactions from Tether’s USDT. They also become one of the most prominent blockchains for decentralized finance (DeFi) and transactions. TRX is the only crypto-token among the top-ranked by market cap, which is performed while the others are facing struggling prices after Bitcoin (BTC) dipped to $93,000. Ethereum ( ETH ) and Ripple’s XRP ( XRP ) also decreased by 0.46% and 5.5% in a day of trading, respectively.

The target price may increase even further, with recent developments saying it would go up to $1 per TRX. This means that the price will rise 150% from the current price of $0.4. This target comes with a reason: the company now handled Tether’s USDT transactions with over $196 billion, or even bigger than Visa does. The token circulations are also only 86 billion, while the highest is 11 billion circulated in 2022, which means that there is still room to grow along with the ecosystem.

Elon’s Billions (ELONBILL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONBILL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Billions can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Billions could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Billions launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Billions on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Billions by entering its contract address – 5VkZGZPArjvA7aDTMVenePmqW62rRZtugUPqC8kEXaez – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONBILL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/elons-billions-elonbill-solana-memecoin-will-explode-17000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37190284,https://cryptonews.com/?p=315919,1733270479,Moodeng Explodes 126% After Coinbase Listing News – Can the Rally Last?,"The meme coin Moodeng (MOODENG) experienced a dramatic 126% price surge within an hour of Coinbase’s announcement on Monday that it would list the token on December 4. This surge pushed MOODENG’s price to $0.68, a 126% gain over the previous 24 hours. The price nearly reached its November peak of $0.69, and the token is within striking distance of a new all-time high. Trading volume also skyrocketed by 400%, reaching $751 million, indicating increased investor interest. Coinbase Effect Drives Moodeng Price Coinbase’s roadmap inclusion, often a precursor to official trading, triggered the price jump. The “Coinbase effect” historically boosts listed tokens. Even though Moodeng trading is not yet active on Coinbase, the listing announcement alone greatly impacted its market performance. #moodeng got just listed in @coinbase and shoot up lfg! pic.twitter.com/yEJ6HLMWPa — madmix (@madmixnum) December 2, 2024 After a two-week decline that saw its price drop from $0.67 to $0.30, Moodeng’s market capitalization is approaching $500 million. Following Monday’s surge, it currently trades at $0.49, with a 151% increase in daily trading volume to $330 million. The listing also positively affected other meme coins, such as GOAT, which jumped 9%, and PNUT, which rose by 6% in the 10 minutes following the Coinbase news. Liquidity Concerns Remain Despite Coinbase Listing Despite the positive momentum, MOODENG’s market depth remains relatively low, indicating potential volatility. On OKX, which hosts the most liquid trading pair for MOODENG, only $81,000 in resting orders exist, which is 2% above the current price. Market depth, a measure of liquidity, aggregates all orders within specific parameters. This thin market suggests the potential for big price swings. Meanwhile, Coinbase indirectly fueled speculation around another meme coin, Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), by featuring it in an Apple Pay tutorial video . $PNUT has been featured on Coinbase’s new Apple Pay tutorial . https://t.co/PQ13V3bqsf pic.twitter.com/cF322KnFkF — 比特币橙子Trader (@chengzi_95330) December 3, 2024 The 15-second video’s prominent display of PNUT, alongside a rising price chart, led some crypto enthusiasts to believe a Coinbase listing might be imminent.

Its current market capitalization and fully diluted valuation stand at $1.2 billion.
