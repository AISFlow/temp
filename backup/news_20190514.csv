Jeff Cartwright left Coinbase in March after nearly five years at the U.S. cryptocurrency exchange in various compliance roles. He joined Facebook as a policy and compliance manager this month, according to his LinkedIn profile.  The profile does not address how involved he will be in Facebook's blockchain projects, which include a secretive plan to create a price-stable cryptocurrency. Reached by CoinDesk Monday evening, Cartwright said he could not discuss his new role. Facebook spokesperson Elka Looks said the company does not comment on personnel.  Meanwhile, Mikheil Moucharrafie, who left Coinbase in April after more than three years, also joined Facebook this month. He is a compliance officer for blockchain at the social media giant.  A lawyer by training, Cartwright joined Coinbase in 2014 after working in compliance roles at American Express and Goldman Sachs and as an anti-money-laundering (AML) consultant at Big Four professional services firm KPMG.  He spent the first three years at Coinbase managing the startup's AML and Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) compliance, was promoted to head of internal audit in March 2017, and then to director of regulatory risk and exams in December of last year.  Moucharrafie has a similar pedigree, having worked as an AML/BSA investigator, compliance manager and risk manager during his time at Facebook.  Facebook's coin  The two hires' legal and regulatory chops may prove valuable to Facebook given the scrutiny its cryptocurrency plans have started to attract in Washington.  Last week, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee wrote an open letter to Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, asking him to share details about the cryptocurrency project, with a particular focus on consumer privacy.  Little is known about the crypto initiative, called Libra. The company quietly began building up a blockchain research team last year, headed up by vice president and former Coinbase board member David Marcus.  The company has posted numerous job listings for the team since, and notable figures in the space such as crypto economist Christian Catalini, a researcher with MIT, have also joined the project.  The company is reportedly looking to raise as much as $1 billion for the project to use as collateral to back a stablecoin.  Anna Baydakova contributed reporting.

42402931,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddfin,1557860426,"Hyperledger Announces Aries, a Toolkit for Blockchain-Based Identity Management","Everyone has a form of sovereign identity, said Evermym's Drummond Reed during CoinDesk LIVE on Tuesday.  Reed and Brian Behlendorf, executive director of Hyperledger, were there to launch their new identity management system.  During his talk, Reed tapped his physical wallet full of cards and cash. That, he said, was the equivalent of state-of-the-art when it came to digital identity.  In an effort to bring identity into the 21st century, the pair have just launched a new, open source framework for identity management, Aries.  The framework, the team wrotes, is ""not a blockchain and it's not an application."" Instead, it is a method to build interoperable and verifiable credentials for secure communication.  The surveillance economy  Reed believes we are ""mainlining the surveillance economy"" when we login with Twitter, Facebook, and even email.  ""With DID and Aries based logins there's no one in the middle. It's just you and your private keys,"" he said.  Reed said the Hyperledger's tools are already being used to build government identity projects. One project, called the Verifiable Organizations Network, is the first public permissioned production ledger for self-sovereign identity.  ""They've issued over 10 million business credentials already,"" Behlendorf said. ""The business owner is the pivot point in how they engage with government agencies. If you're a restaurant owner in Vancouver you want to get licensed to serve food that's a local government thing, you want a license to serve alcohol and that's a Canada thing, you want a pay taxes,"" said Behlendorf. ""All these involve exchanging permits and credentials. If you had to wait for all those governments to integrate all those systems you'd be waiting forever.""  With self-sovereign identity tools like Aires you reduce the time it takes to spin up identity systems. That, he said, is a good thing.  The product includes:  A blockchain interface layer (known as a resolver) for creating and signing blockchain transactions.  A cryptographic wallet for secure storage (the secure storage tech, not a UI) of cryptographic secrets and other information used to build blockchain clients.  An encrypted messaging system for off-ledger interactions between clients using multiple transport protocols.  An implementation of ZKP-capable W3C verifiable credentials using the ZKP primitives found in Ursa.  An implementation of the Decentralized Key Management System (DKMS) specification currently being incubated in Hyperledger Indy.  A mechanism to build higher-level protocols and API-like use cases based on the secure messaging functionality described earlier.    The project is an offshoot of two other Hyperledger efforts: Indy for identity management and Ursa for security.  The code will be available on GitHub once the project gets rolling. And with luck, according to Reed, the initiative will help do away with paper IDs entirely over the next two years.  Ram image by Hazel Clifton on Unsplash.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) again delayed a decision on whether to approve or rejecta bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Tuesday.  In a new document published by the SEC, the regulator said it would hold off on making a decision on the Bitwise ETF proposal filed with NYSE Arca.  The proposal was first filed in January of this year, kicking off a new race to launch a bitcoin ETF in the U.S., which is expected to bring fresh money – and therefore, liquidity – to the crypto space.  The SEC last postponed a decision on both the Bitwise and VanEck/SolidX proposals at the end of March, kicking both to May. The regulator has yet to approve any bitcoin ETFs, though both experts in the space and officials with the agency seem to believe that it's only a matter of time.  Crypto Crescent Asset Management, a digital asset and fund manager, has also proposed a crypto ETF, which would give customers exposure to both bitcoin and ether. The firm, which is partnering with NYSE Arca, has not yet formally filed its proposal, however.  There will be a public comment period for three weeks after the latest document regarding the Bitwise ETF is published in the Federal Register, plus an additional two weeks for responses.

42402919,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddfR5,1557853229,Crypto Hedge Funds’ Average AUM Grew Three Times in Q1,"The average assets under management (AUM) of global cryptocurrency hedge funds increased three-fold in the first quarter of 2019, new research indicates.  Consultancy firm PwC and investment firm Elwood Asset Management jointly published a report on Monday, saying that the median crypto hedge fund AUM has grown to $4.3 million at the end of Q1 2019 as compared to $1.2 million in January 2018.  The growth indicates that funds have been “relatively successful” at raising investments despite bearish market conditions during the period, the firms said.  The report, based on interactions with 100 crypto hedge funds, further highlighted that the average fund AUM was $21.9 million as of Q1 2019 and 60% of funds have less than $10 million in assets while only less than 10 percent are managing assets over $50 million.  Crypto hedge funds also performed better than bitcoin last year, the report found. While bitcoin plunged about 72 percent in 2018, the median crypto hedge fund lost only 46 percent over the same period, “indicating that these managers were successfully able to outperform their benchmark.”  However, performance varied based on the type of strategy adopted. For instance, the median ""quantitative"" fund returned 8 percent in 2018, while the median ""fundamental and discretionary"" funds performed negatively, with returns of -53 percent and -63 percent respectively, according to the report.  In a separate statement, PwC Hong Kong director Henri Arslanian, said:  “The crypto hedge fund industry today is probably where the traditional hedge fund industry was in the early 1990s. We expect the industry to go through a rapid period of institutionalisation and implementation of sound practices over the coming years.”  Elwood CEO Bin Ren shared similar view saying that there is “increasing evidence of institutionalisation” in the cryptocurrency space, which is a positive step towards digital assets being recognized as an asset class with “true viability and longevity.”  Another report from Crypto Fund Research last October showed that crypto hedge fund launches are spiking to all-time highs. There were 90 launches in the first three quarters of 2018, and the total was expected to reach as high as 120 for the financial year.

42402920,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddfav,1557851406,"Joe Lubin, Jimmy Song Strike $500K Crypto Bet on Ethereum's Future","The terms of a much-hyped bet have finally been settled, and, at current prices, more than $500,000 in crypto is on the line.  ""It's a maximum pain kind of bet,"" Jimmy Song said during a session of CoinDesk Live at Consensus 2019. ""Skin in the game.""  The new details stem from an onstage agreement from Consensus 2018, where Lubin told Song that he would bet ""any amount of bitcoin"" that ethereum's decentralized apps would have a non-trivial number of users in five years.  Song had accused Lubin of ""weaseling"" out of the bet in recent weeks, including calling Lubin out on Twitter.  But the meeting of the two crypto thought leaders on Tuesday did not disappoint, especially in terms of how much crypto was wagered.  Deal terms  If ethereum is doing great four years from now, Song will pay Lubin (or his beneficiary) 810.8 ETH. If the dapp economy is sputtering at that point, Lubin will send Song 69.74 BTC.  For Lubin to win, Ethereum needs to have five unique dapps achieving 10,000 or more daily active users and 100,000 monthly active users for any six calendar months in any 12-calendar-month period up to and including May 23, 2023.  To be clear, this is not a small bet for either side, and both acknowledge that whichever side wins, it will hurt badly. It's also possible the loser will be giving up considerably more money in 2023 than they would today.  When the bet was first made, on May 14, 2018, BTC was trading at $8,577. So, Lubin had effectively bet $598,190 based on prices at the time. That's $564,307 at today's prices.  The difference in ETH was much more stark, however. At the time of the bet last year, ETH was trading at $722.86. So, Song effectively bet $586,095 at prices at the time – but only $168,030 at today's prices.  If he wins, Song was very clear that the BTC will go straight to him. ""I want it to hurt for you,"" Song told Lubin. ""I don't want you to feel like you are donating to charity.""  ""I'm fine with that,"" Lubin replied.  The terms have slowly been hammered out over the last year since the bet was first spoken into existence. The two sides have been working on a shared document that they've committed to share with CoinDesk once the final piece is in place: settling on a public arbiter.  ""Jimmy's thesis was that there would be no significant applications on blockchain, and the only thing relevant in blockchain was bitcoin,"" Lubin said on CoinDesk Live. ""My thesis is bitcoin is awesome, and there's a narrow set of use cases built on bitcoin and that's wonderful. We love that, but decentralized applications are also really useful.""  There are some definitions of daily active users in the document. The point, Song explained, was for the dapp in question to achieve something like the numbers an Android mobile app would need to be deemed an early success.  Critically, Song argued that the transactions only count if they are on chain. It doesn't matter who pays for the gas to put them on chain, he agreed (the startup itself could front that), but it needs to hit the base layer.  The sticking point had been what it meant to spend money, but once Song agreed that it didn't have to be paid by the user – as long as it hit the chain – terms were done.  Lubin proposed a hug and Song accepted.  You can watch the full exchange here:  Web3 or bust  At its core, the bet hinges on whether the decentralized web will come to fruition – and whether ethereum will deliver it.  Song argued that centralized technology will always be faster and easier to develop on, and that's why he doesn't believe the decentralized web has a future.  ""The only reason dapps exist is to raise money from gullible people or from greedy FOMO people, and that's essentially what the ethereum platform has done,"" Song said.  It's possible that the world could change in a way that doesn't fit the terms of the bet. For example, Felix Salmon and Ben Horowitz made a bet five years ago that bitcoin would be widely used in payments. Five years later, Horowitz lost that bet, and yet at the same time he's still won by investing successfully in crypto.  To that point, Lubin noted:  ""It's possible that there are many many successful applications on ethereum that are sufficiently decenteralized and they don't hit exactly those two criteria. So it's possible I will lose and the ecosystem will be strong.""

In a blog post Tuesday, the firm said it now offers crypto-to-crypto trading for USDC in those countries on both its retail site Coinbase.com and its Coinbase Pro service.  The firm touted the strengths of the token in the post, saying it offers a stable store of value and can be sent ""near-instantly"" around the globe. ""Unlike other cryptocurrencies, each USDC is backed by $1 USD with monthly transparency audits showing 100% USD backing,"" Coinbase said.  USDC could also help in countries where the national fiat currency is unstable, the firm suggested.  Coinbase said:  ""For new customers in countries like Argentina and Uzbekistan, where consumer prices are expected to inflate by 10–20% in 2020, stablecoins like USDC could provide an opportunity to protect against inflation.""  It further committed to providing more fiat-to-crypto onramps to enable more people to make use of the stable asset.  In the same announcement, Coinbase provided an update on the number of nations it now serves. While a year ago, 32 countries had access to its services, that number now stands at 103, with 50 announced today.  USDC was launched last autumn by a group of firms including crypto finance startup Circle. The CENTRE consortium developed the coin as a means to easily transfer value on public blockchains.  “Crypto assets and blockchain technology will enable us to exchange value and transact with one another … instantly, globally, securely and at low cost,” Circle said at the time.  In February, Coinbase soft launched a service that uses USDC and XRP as a means to make “fast and free” international payments.

As Quirk said later: ""As soon as you open the door, you're going to get a lot of people"" looking to participate in the market.  He also noted that attendance has been “off the charts” at the bitcoin education events facilitated by the company, and that this intense interest isn’t just from millennials, but older retail investors too. Likewise, TD Ameritrade has found that investment advisors (RIAs) are equally interested in bitcoin futures as the company’s ‘pure retail’ clients.  Quirk and fellow panelist Thomas Chippas, CEO of exchange ErisX (which TD Ameritrade has invested in) also commented on institutional investors, which, perhaps despite popular perception, they claimed are already investing in bitcoin.  “Apologies it’s not happening faster,” Chippas said in a nod to skeptics, but “it’s happening, it’s never going to be fast enough for the people who write headlines.”  Quirk also gave credence to the idea that institutional investors are waiting for an ETF to emerge before they invest in bitcoin. “We hear that quite a bit,” he confirmed.  Quirk and Chippas further commented that there is demand for physically settled bitcoin futures, which, because they would be based on an underlying commodity and not be cash settled, would enable traditional risk management tools to “function better.”  As for their outlook on the future of digital assets, Quirk compared the current market to the dot com bubble of the 1990s. While the bubble ultimately burst, successful companies like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google (FAANG) emerged.  “The second iteration of this could look just like the FAANG complex,” Quirk predicted.

BitGo's new clearing and settlement service will be provided to its regulated BitGo Trust Company clients, and will ensure that assets never leave custody when being transferred, while the actual settlement is ""fast, compliant and secure,"" according to a press release. During a trade, BitGo will act as the custodian on either side, which the company claims will reduce counterparty risk.  In addition to counterparty risk, BitGo says its new offering will reduce security risks, prevent accidental compliance infringement and allow investors to more efficiently allocate their capital.  Under its new program, a transfer between two different companies will be recorded, but the assets being traded will remain in cold storage at all times. Trades would be settled off-chain, with transactions being reconciled with the relevant blockchain upon withdrawal.  Mike Belshe, BitGo's chief executive, said in a statement that the new product is aimed at institutional investors.  In addition to counterparty risk, institutional investors at present face issues with having to store assets on multiple exchanges prior to conducting trades and settling transactions outside cold storage.  ""Until now, in a digital asset trade, one party needed to assume all of the risk and act on the counterparty’s good faith, and this doesn’t really work for institutional investors,"" Belshe said, adding:  ""We are bringing to market a risk-less, efficient, and compliant digital asset clearing and settlement, and what makes this service possible is BitGo Trust’s strong client base.""  As such, BitGo is hoping to draw in over-the-counter trading desks, single-dealer platforms, exchanges, asset managers and broker-dealers. To take advantage of the new service, all participants in a transaction would need to custody their assets with BitGo.

42402925,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddfer,1557842453,"RIF Launches 'Layer 3' Network to Scale Bitcoin-Based Smart Contracts, Tokens","RIF Labs, which developed the RSK Network for ethereum-like tokens and smart contracts on top of bitcoin's blockchain, has launched a ""third-layer solution"" to help scale this technology.  After more than a year in the works, the Lumino project is now officially live, RIF said Tuesday. The Gibraltar-based firm, parent of the startup RSK Labs, claims Lumino can handle up to 5,000 transactions per second (tps).  While that may pale in comparison to the 65,000 tps the Visa network is capable of processing (according to the payments giant's latest annual report), it's still an improvement over bitcoin's transaction throughput, which rarely cracks two digits.  Conceptually, Lumino is similar to bitcoin's lightning network, in that it allows parties to transact off-chain, in so-called state channels, until one party decides to record their balance on the blockchain for final settlement.  However, in addition to bitcoin, Lumino can also scale transaction volume for the tokens running on the RSK Network, RIF said. There are about a dozen such tokens currently, according to the RSK block explorer.  That network, launched in early 2018, is itself a so-called sidechain, or ledger that runs in parallel to the main bitcoin blockchain. An asset can be locked up on the main chain and then traded on the sidechain, and vice versa. This allows for complex things like smart-contract creation and token issuance to occur on the sidechain without burdening the bitcoin network.  Off-chain scaling  RSK Labs said in May 2018 that the sidechain, also known as Rootstock, could process 100 transactions per second, but even then recognized that this was not sufficient for mass adoption. Hence its work, already underway at the time, on Lumino.  ""While the RSK Network added smart contract capabilities and on-chain scaling improvements on top of the bitcoin network, it is not enough to achieve transaction processing levels on par with those offered by major payment processors around the world,"" RIF said in a press release Tuesday.  Trying to scale purely on-chain will create problems down the line, the company added, ""as every record saved on the blockchain needs to be saved forever. It is going to become increasingly difficult to maintain and validate multi-terabyte blockchains in the coming years."" (As of this writing, the bitcoin blockchain is over 216,000 megabytes big, or 0.216 terabytes, according to Blockchain.com data.)  By contrast, Lumino offers ""near-instant processing capabilities and network transaction costs at a fraction of a cent,"" RIF claimed.  Still, Sergio Lerner, head of research and innovation at RIF Labs, was careful to describe the new network as only ""the first step towards a scalable network infrastructure.”  Lumino also integrates with the previously launched RIF Name Service, allowing participants to create aliases when opening state channels and sending payments, instead of the usual cat-walked-on-the-keyboard alphanumeric strings that can bewilder non-technical users.

42402913,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddfWz,1557840726,"Floyd Mayweather, DJ Khaled Escape Lawsuit Brought By ICO Investors","Boxer Floyd Mayweather, music producer DJ Khaled and two employees of an ICO project have been dismissed from an investor lawsuit by a federal judge.  According to a new court document, an omnibus order on motions to dismiss by Mayweather, Khaled, Steven Sykes and Steven Stanley, all of whom promoted or participated in the Centra Tech initial coin offering, was filed by federal Judge Robert Scola, of the Southern District of Florida. Scola said the plaintiffs failed to prove that they had bought Centra's CTR tokens as a result of the defendants' actions.  Mayweather and Khaled both notably promoted Centra Tech's offering, encouraging their respective fanbases to participate in what was later deemed to be an unregistered securities sale. They, along with Sykes and Stanley, were sued by investors in the offering, who alleged that the defendants violated securities law.  In Monday's order, Scola said that one count, filed against Mayweather and Khaled, alleged they violated securities laws, but, in one analysis the plaintiffs failed ""to establish that Mayweather reached out to the Plaintiffs and successfully solicited Plaintiffs to purchase CTR Tokens.""  The judge further said that there was no evidence that the plaintiffs even saw Mayweather's promotional materials, let alone bought Centra Tech's tokens as a result. The same analysis applied to Khaled.  As for the allegations against Sykes, the judge wrote:  ""The allegations against Sykes are based on his involvement with the website. The Complaint, however, is devoid of any specificity with regard to the content of the website, when the website was launched, the alleged misstatements on the website, who determined the content on the website, and if the Plaintiffs ever even visited the website.""  Again, a similar analysis supported Stanley's motion to dismiss, the judge wrote.  The lawsuit also includes allegations against Centra's founders, Raymond Trapani, Sohrab Sharma and Robert Farkas. The order to dismiss did not touch these counts, and that aspect of the lawsuit will continue.  The three founders have also been sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and accused of fraud by the Department of Justice.  Mayweather and Khaled previously settled charges with the SEC, who said the two failed to disclose they were paid for promoting the ICO.

Chae Won-cheol, senior managing director of the product strategy team at Samsung Electronics' wireless business division, said:  ""We will lower barriers to new experiences by gradually expanding the number of Galaxy models that support blockchain functions. We will also expand our service target countries after Korea, the United States and Canada.""  The Samsung Blockchain Wallet is currently only available on Samsung’s recently launched flagship phone range, the Galaxy S10. The S10 additionally comes with blockchain features such as digital signing and decentralized apps (dapps), which the report appears to suggest may also be added across the Galaxy range.  Business Korea said that Samsung is also in talks with telecom firms such as SK Telecom and KT Corporation (formerly Korea Telecom) about possibly of working together on blockchain-based digital identity verification tools and other initiatives.  Samsung has been wading deeper into the blockchain waters in recent months.  Following the reveal of the blockchain and crypto focus for the Galaxy S10 phones, it notably said it is developing its own blockchain network based on ethereum and may also issue a ""Samsung Coin"" token in the future.

The folks at Emberfund imagine a different way.  Their app, available now for iOS and Android, lets you buy into an index of cryptocurrencies that automatically balances itself over time. The founders, Alex Wang, Mario Lazaro, and Guillaume Torche, have a background in AI and met when working at GumGum, another AI startup. They brought their machine learning and algorithmic smarts to bear on building a better crypto hedge fund.  The product works like a regular wallet. You add cash via the app and then select an investment strategy including a weighted fund of ethereum, bitcoin and litecoin, or something like the Marius 5 S-Tier Fund created by Quora commenter Marius Kramer. The system can automatically change the currency weightings based on prices and other indicators.  [gallery size=""medium"" ids=""398614,398615,398616""]    Click images to enlarge    ""We're the first product in the world that allows anyone to invest like a cryptocurrency hedge fund, with just $100,"" said Wang. ""A key differentiator is that we're non-custodial so all assets are encrypted by the user's mobile device, we never touch, custody or transmit user funds.  He continued:  ""The rocket science is that we've figured out how to do asset management, without ever taking custody of assets.""  The team has even created an algorithmic hedge fund that trades automatically, greatly reducing human interaction.  The recent saturation of crypto hedge funds hasn't stopped Emberfund from building its product. The founders bootstrapped the business themselves, chipping in $5,000 each. And they've gone a long way on such a small seed.  ""We had almost $2 million in transactions last month and now have millions of assets under management,"" said Wang.  ""We were excited by the notion that this technology would enable the family in a third world country to have access to the same financial products as a Goldman Sachs banker and set out to build a product that would do just that,"" said Wang.

42402932,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddfjm,1557832235,Bitcoin's Monthly Price Gains Already Highest Since November 2017,"View  Bitcoin hit a fresh 10-month high of $8,335 on Bitstamp earlier today and is currently reporting its largest monthly gain since November 2017.  A bearish divergence of the hourly chart relative strength index and overbought conditions signaled by longer-duration RSIs indicate scope for a pullback to $7,400.  A rally to $8,500 could be seen in the U.S. trading hours if BTC invalidates the above bearish chart pattern with a move over $8,335.  Bitcoin (BTC) clocked fresh 10-month highs earlier today and currently appears on track to post its largest monthly gain since late 2017.  The cryptocurrency market leader rose to $8,335 at 08:00 UTC on Tuesday, the highest level since July 25, according to Bitstamp prices.  As of writing, BTC dropped back slightly to $8,000, but that still represents 51.5 percent gains on the monthly opening price of $5,267.  It is worth noting that the last time the cryptocurrency chalked up over 50 percent monthly gains was during the height of the bull market in 2017. Prices rallied 54 percent in November 2017 on speculation that the launch of BTC futures on major U.S. derivative exchanges would open the doors to institutional money in the crypto space.  So, as long as prices close May above $7,350, the monthly gain would be the highest since November 2017.  Monthly chart  With long-term technical studies biased bullish, the cryptocurrency looks set to post its best monthly gain since August 2017.  The recent rally, however, is looking overstretched on the short-term charts. So, a price pullback and a monthly close below $7,347 cannot be ruled out.  Daily, weekly and 3-day charts  As can be seen (above left), the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is reporting overbought conditions with an above-80 reading. The RSIs on both the weekly and 3-day charts (above right) are also flashing similar signals.  As a result, the cryptocurrency may have a tough time scaling the immediate resistance at $8,500 (July 2018 high) in the short-term.  It is worth noting that many in the investor community, including Fundstrat's Tom Lee, have associated the recent rally with the Consensus 2019 conference in New York, which kicked off on Monday. BTC, therefore, could witness a ""sell the fact"" pullback following the conclusion of Blockchain Week.  As for the next 24 hours, the cryptocurrency could fall back to lows near $7,450, according to the hourly chart below.  Hourly chart  BTC has created a bearish engulfing candle and the RSI has created lower highs as opposed to higher highs on the price.  That bearish divergence indicates that bullish momentum has weakened and a price pullback could be in the offing, possibly to the 50-hour moving average (MA), currently located at $7,448.  The bearish divergence, however, would be invalidated if the price rises above $8,335. In that case, the cryptocurrency will likely challenge $8,500.

The San Francisco-based firm tweeted the news Monday, saying that New Yorkers can now buy, sell, convert, send, receive or store XRP on Coinbase.com or via its iOS and Android mobile apps.  After the announcement, the price of XRP jumped over 20 percent to reach a high of $0.39, according to data from CoinMarketCap. However, the surge also coincides with bullish moves from bitcoin in the last 24 hours.  Coinbase initially added XRP support for its retail platforms in February of this year, but New York and U.K. residents were not included at the time.  The exchange's list of supported cryptocurrencies continues to grow. It currently offers support for bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH), ethereum classic (ETC), litecoin (LTC), Circle’s USDC stablecoin, zcash, Brave’s Basic Attention Token (BAT), among others.  Coinbase also recently started offering a “fast and free” payments service using XRP and USDC stablecoin. The service is “primarily designed as an educational resource for customers to learn about the benefits of using crypto for cross-border payments,” the exchange’s representative told CoinDesk at the time.

42402914,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddfXy,1557824407,HTC Has Added In-Wallet Crypto Swaps to Its EXODUS Phone,"HTC’s blockchain phone, the EXODUS 1, now allows users to directly swap between some cryptocurrencies within its native wallet, the Taiwanese electronics giant announced Tuesday.  The new feature comes thanks to a new partnership that sees HTC add the liquidity protocol from decentralized exchange startup Kyber Network to its Zion Vault wallet app.  The addition means users can swap between ERC-20 tokens such as Brave's Basic Attention Token (BAT) and MakerDAO’s DAI stablecoin, directly in Zion Vault, removing the need to first move tokens to third-party cryptocurrency exchanges. Swaps are entirely done on-chain, HTC said, adding that “fast and secure” crypto-to-crypto trading within mobile applications is key to streamlining the user experience.  Phil Chen, Decentralized Chief Officer HTC, told Coindesk:  “The ability to swap ERC-20 tokens on chain in the Zion Vault without relying on third party exchanges is another step in empowering the user and maximizing security and privacy, which is at the center of the EXODUS mission.”  Kyber Network CEO Loi Luu told CoinDesk last September that the firm aims to open up ERC-20 tokens to wider use cases, so they can be “seamlessly used for payments, as collateral for lending, investing in funds and so on.” ERC-20 is an ethereum standard widely used to build crypto tokens.  In today's announcement, HTC said Kyber’s protocol allows decentralized token swaps to be integrated into any application, including wallets, vendors, websites and decentralized applications (dapps).  HTC is further planning to launch another blockchain phone this year, Chen revealed in late April. Last week, he revealed new details indicating that the upcoming EXODUS 1s will be a low-cost option and will notably be capable of acting as a full node for the bitcoin network.  “We think that’s foundational to the whole decentralized internet and just the whole fundamental premise,” he said. “If you don’t own your keys, you don’t own your bitcoin, you don’t own your crypto.”  Chen said that, while the bitcoin blockchain would be large to store on a cellphone, as is required for nodes, he ""expects"" HTC would provide sufficient memory, explaining:  Imagine the iPod with 256 gigs … of course the music fan wants to keep the whole music library, but the crypto fan wants to keep the whole bitcoin blockchain.”  The EXODUS 1s is expected to retail for between $250 and $300.

At CoinDesk's Consensus 2019 conference, he took aim at the ""architecture"" most decentralized apps use these days, arguing that apps across the space are putting too much reliance (and data) on blockchains.  That's not to say that blockchains don't have an important role to play in building ""decentralized apps,"" or forward-looking apps that users don't have to trust with their data. But Ali, who's company is working on a decentralized app platform that recently announced plans to register their upcoming token sale with the U.S. SEC, argued that people are using the blockchain layer ""too much.""  ""You don’t even need blockchains to build decentralized apps at all,"" he argued.  That's not to say Ali doesn't agree with the idea of decentralizing apps. Indeed, the company is built around the idea that this approach represents the future of computing.  ""The Googles and Facebooks of the world are sitting on large amounts of data. Their business is to know more and more about you. With decentralized computing, you have more control. There’s no big company in the middle,"" Ali said.  He even admits that blockchains do indeed have an important role to play for some apps.  But, he thinks people have been using blockchains more than are necessary: ""If you look at our industry right now, we’ve been trying to implement [decentralized apps] in a kind of odd way.""  The 'world computer'  Ali pointed to the idea of a ""world computer,"" an influential concept that's floated around the industry for years. The concept is perhaps most tightly associated with the third largest cryptocurrency by market cap, ethereum, though Ali stressed more than once that he is not referencing any one project in particular.  He thinks that the idea of a world computer is a fluke, because people of that methodology focus on putting all global state on the blockchain.  ""If you take these concepts to Web3, they completely break down. Global state is absolutely not something we can put on a blockchain, where every new user is slowing everyone else down,"" Ali asserted.  In that vein, Ali noted that his decentralized app platform Blockstack has been working on its own storage technology, ""Gaia storage,"" which is heavily informed by Ali's research as a computer scientist in that area.  ""This is radically, radically different than anything you’ve seen in the crypto space,"" Ali said.

42402905,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdddbw,1557806415,"Yes, You May Need a Blockchain","Balaji S. Srinivasan is the former CTO of Coinbase, a Board Partner at Andreessen Horowitz and a member of CoinDesk’s advisory board.  The following article originally appeared in Consensus Magazine, distributed exclusively to attendees of CoinDesk’s Consensus 2019 event.      There’s a certain kind of developer who states that blockchains are just terrible databases. As the narrative goes, why not just use PostgreSQL for your application? It’s mature, robust, and high performance. Compared to relational databases, the skeptic claims that blockchains are just slow, clunky and expensive databases that don’t scale.  While some critiques of this critique are already out there (1, 2), I’d propose a simple one sentence rebuttal: public blockchains are useful for storing shared state, particularly when that shared state represents valuable data that users want to export/import without error — like their money.  The data export/import problem  Take a look at the cloud diagrams for Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud. There are icons for load balancers, transcoders, queues, and lambda functions.  There are icons for VPCs and every type of database under the sun, including the new-ish managed blockchain services (which are distinct from public blockchains, though potentially useful in some circumstances).  What there isn’t an icon for is shared state between accounts. That is, these cloud diagrams all implicitly assume that a single entity and its employees (namely, the entity with access to the cloud root account) is the only one laying out the architecture diagram and reading from or writing to the application it underpins. More precisely, these diagrams typically assume the presence of a single economic actor, namely the entity paying the cloud bills.*  But if we visualize the cloud diagrams for not just one but one hundred corporate economic actors at a time, some immediate questions arise. Can these actors interoperate? Can their users pull their data out and bring it into other applications? And given that the users are themselves economic actors, if this data represents something of monetary value, can the users be confident that their data wasn’t modified during all this exporting and importing?  These are the types of questions that arise when we think about the data export and import from each entity’s application as a first-class requirement. And (with exceptions that we’ll get into), in general, the answer to these questions today is typically no.  No — different applications typically don’t have interoperable software, or allow their users to easily export/import their data in a standard form, or give users certainty that their data wasn’t intentionally tampered with or inadvertently corrupted during all the exporting and importing.  The reason why boils down to incentives. For most major internet services, there is simply no financial incentive to enable users to export their data, let alone to enable competitors to quickly import said data. While some call this the data portability problem, let’s call it the data export/import problem to focus attention on the specific mechanisms for export and import.  Current approaches to the data export/import problem  Even though the financial incentives aren’t yet present for a general solution to the data export/import problem, mechanisms have been created for many important special cases. These mechanisms include APIs, JSON/PDF/CSV exports, MBOX files, and (in a banking context) SFTP.  Let’s go through these in turn to understand the current state of affairs.  APIs. One of the most popular ways to export/import data is via Application Programming Interfaces, better known as APIs. Some businesses do let you get some of your data out, or give you the ability to write data to your account. But there’s a cost. First, their internal data format is typically proprietary and not an industry standard. Second, sometimes the APIs are not central to their core business and can be turned off. Third, sometimes the APIs are central to their core business and the price can be dramatically raised. In general, if you’re reading or writing to a hosted API, you’re at the mercy of the API provider. We call this platform risk, and being unceremoniously de-platformed has harmed many a startup.  JSON. Another related solution is to allow users or scripts to download JSON files, or read/write them to the aforementioned APIs. This is fine as far as it goes, but JSON is very free form and can describe virtually anything. For example, Facebook’s Graph API and LinkedIn’s REST API deal with similar things but return very different JSON results.  PDF. Another very partial solution is to allow users to export a PDF. This works for documents, as PDF is an open standard that can be read by other applications like Preview, Adobe Acrobat, Google Drive, Dropbox, and so on. But a PDF is meant to be an end product, to be read by a human. It’s not meant to be an input to any application besides a PDF viewer.  CSV. The humble comma separated value file gets closer to what we want for a general solution to the data import/export problem. Unlike the backend of a proprietary API, CSV is a standard format described by RFC 4180. Unlike JSON, which can represent almost anything, a CSV typically represents just a table. And unlike a PDF, a CSV can typically be edited locally by a user via a spreadsheet or used as machine-readable input to a local or cloud application. Because most kinds of data can be represented in a relational database, and because relational databases can usually be exported as a set of possibly gigantic CSVs, it’s also pretty general. However, CSVs are disadvantaged in a few ways. First, unlike a proprietary API, they aren’t hosted. That is, there’s no single canonical place to read or write a CSV representing (say) a record of transactions or a table of map metadata. Second, CSVs aren’t tamper resistant. If a user exports a record of transactions from service A, modifies it, and reuploads it to service B, the second service would be none the wiser. Third, CSVs don’t have built-in integrity checks to protect against inadvertent error. For example, the columns of a CSV don’t have explicit type information, which means that a column containing the months of the year from 1-12 could have its type auto-converted upon import into a simple integer, causing confusion.  MBOX. While less well known than CSV, the MBOX format for representing collections of email messages is the closest thing out there to a standardized data structure built for import and export between major platforms and independent applications alike. Indeed, there have been papers proposing the use of MBOX in contexts outside of email. While CSV represents tabular data, MBOX represents a type of log-structured data. It’s essentially a single huge plain text file of email messages in chronological order, but can also represent images/file attachments via MIME. Like CSV, MBOX files are an open standard and can be exported, edited locally, and reimported. And like CSV, MBOX has the disadvantages of no canonical host or intrinsic data integrity check.  SFTP. Before we move on, there’s one more data export/import mechanism that deserves mention: the secure file transfer protocol, or SFTP. While venerable, this is actually the way that individuals send ACH payments back and forth to each other. Essentially, financial institutions use SFTP servers to take in electronic transaction data in specially formatted files and transmit it to the Federal Reserve each day to sync ACH debits and credits with each other (see here, here, here, and here).  Each of these mechanisms is widely used. But they are insufficient for enabling the general case of tamper-resistant import and export of valuable data between arbitrary economic actors — whether they be corporate entities, individual users, or headless scripts. For that, we need public blockchains.  Public blockchains enable shared state by incentivizing interoperability. Public blockchains convert many types of data import/export problems into a general class of shared state problems. And they do so in part by incorporating many of the best features of the mechanisms described above.  Public blockchains provide canonical methods for read/write access like a hosted corporate API, but without the same platform risk. No single economic actor can shut down or deny service to clients of a decentralized public blockchain like bitcoin or ethereum.  They also enable individual users to export critical data to their local computer or to a new application like JSON/CSV/MBOX (either by sending out funds or exporting private keys) while providing cryptographic guarantees of data integrity.  They provide a means for arbitrary economic actors (whether corporations, individual users, or programs) to seamlessly interoperate. Every economic actor who reads from a public blockchain sees the same result, and any economic actor with sufficient funds can write to a public blockchain in the same way. No account setup is necessary and no actor can be blocked from read/write access.  And perhaps most importantly, public blockchains give financial incentives for interoperability and data integrity.  This last point deserves elaboration. A public blockchain like bitcoin or ethereum typically records the transfer of things of monetary value. This thing could be the intrinsic cryptocurrency of the chain, a token issued on top of the chain, or another kind of digital asset.  Because the data associated with a public blockchain represents something of monetary value, it finally delivers the financial incentive for interoperability. After all, any web or mobile app that wants to receive (say) BTC must honor the bitcoin blockchain’s conventions. Indeed, the application developers would have no choice due to the fact that bitcoin by design has a single, canonical longest proof-of-work chain with cryptographic validation of every block in that chain.  So, that’s the financial incentive for import.  As for the incentive for export, when it comes to money in particular, users demand the ability to export with complete fidelity, and very quickly. It’s not their old cat pics, which they might be ok with losing track of due to inconvenience or technical issues. It’s their money, their bitcoin, their cryptocurrency. Any application that holds it must make it available for export when they want to withdraw it, whether that means supporting send functionality, offering private key backups, or both. If not, the application is unlikely to ever receive deposits in the first place.  So, that’s the financial incentive for export. Thus, a public blockchain economically incentivizes every economic actor that interacts with it to use the same import/export format as every other actor, whether they be corporation, user, or program. Put another way, public blockchains are the next step after open source, as they provide open data. Anyone can code their own block explorer by reading from a public blockchain, and anyone can create their own wallet capable of writing to a public blockchain.  That’s a real breakthrough. We’ve now got a reliable way to incentivize the use of shared state, to simultaneously allow millions of individuals and companies access to read from (and thousands to write to) the same data store while enforcing a common standard and maintaining high confidence in the integrity of the data.  This is very different from the status quo. You typically don’t share the root password to your database on the internet, because a database that allows anyone to read/write to it usually gets corrupted. Public blockchains solve this problem with cryptography rather than permissions, greatly increasing the number of simultaneous users.  It’s true that today public blockchains are typically focused on monetary and financial applications, where the underlying dataset represents an append-only transaction history with immutable records. That does limit their generality, in terms of addressing all the different versions of the data import/export problem. But there’s ongoing development on public blockchain versions of things like OpenStreetMaps, Wikipedia, and Twitter as well as systems like Filecoin/IPFS. These wouldn’t just represent records of financial transactions where immutability was a requirement, but could represent other types of data (like map or encyclopedia entries) that would be routinely updated.  Done right, these newer types of public blockchain-based systems may allow any economic actor with sufficient funds and/or cryptographic credentials to not just read and write but also edit their own records while preserving data integrity. Given this capability, there’s no reason one can’t put a SQL layer on top of a public blockchain to work with the shared state it affords, just like an old-fashioned relational database. This results in a new type of database with no privileged owner, where all seven billion humans on the planet (and their scripts!) are authorized users, and which can be written to by any entity with sufficient funds.  That day isn’t here yet. It remains to see how far we can push the use cases for public chains. And scaling challenges abound. But hopefully, it’s clear that while public blockchains are indeed a new kind of database, they offer something quite different than what a traditional database offers.      * The one exception is the so-called ""Requester Pays"" feature that Amazon and other cloud services offer. This is a cool feature that lets someone pay to write to your S3 bucket. But it's permissioned – it still requires every would-be writer to open an AWS account, and the bucket owner has to be willing to let them all write to their bucket, so there's still a single distinguished owner.

42402895,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdddT5,1557799228,Proposal's Merger Paves Way for New Bitcoin Lightning Features,"A new routing proposal is expected to be merged today into the official ""specifications"" of lightning, the technology many advocates trumpet as the fix to bitcoin's long-standing payment problems.  Christian Decker, one of the most prolific lightning developers who engineers for the tech startup Blockstream, pointed out that the proposal, which he wrote, is moving on to the next stage at CoinDesk's Consensus 2019 conference, emphasizing that this change will pave the way for many highly-anticipated lightning features.  These new features are needed because lightning is still experimental and considered even ""reckless"" to use, as some people are still occasionally losing money from bugs in the protocol. The hope is that new features such as these will continue to help make the payment method easier to use.  Decker elaborated to CoinDesk:  ""This enables quite some cool new features, including multi-path routing, trampoline routing, and so forth. It's on the agenda for today's [IRC specification] meeting and I'm confident it'll get merged today, so we can get started on the next wave of features.""  Decker has also already written up a code implementation, putting the proposal into practice. Other developers across the ecosystem agree that it's a handy change, which is why it is now being merged into the specifications.  All lightning code implementations will need to code up these specifications in order to remain interoperable, meaning one person using one implementation can send a payment of another.  Decker calls it a ""multi-frame"" proposal, ""which allows us to include more information in the routing onion,"" the same technology used in the popular privacy-minded browser Tor.  When trying to send a payment across the network, even intermediaries can't see the information within them by using a technique which mirrors an ""onion"" in that a layer of obfuscation is peeled away at each hop in the network. So, say there are four hops, the four layers are peeled away one by one with each hop, until the payment reaches the recipient.  The proposal makes changes to the routing onion format so that it can include more information that other routing tools on top of it need.
