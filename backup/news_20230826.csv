16595262,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548982,1693087238,PEPE Price Spikes 10% Following Community Address On Rumored Rug Pull,"The value of PEPE, one of the most promising assets in the second quarter of 2023, has been faltering in recent weeks. According to CoinGecko data, the meme coin has been in a 33.6% price decline in the last 14 days. The PEPE price took a significant hit in the past week, tumbling by more than 20% in a matter of hours. This negative price action was triggered by the rumors of a rug pull orchestrated by the project deployers. On Thursday, August 24, about $16 million worth of Pepe tokens were moved from the developers’ multi-sig wallet to various crypto exchanges, spreading FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) across the community. The team behind the meme coin has now published an announcement, addressing the community on what happened in the past few days. ‘Three Rouge Ex-Team Members Responsible For $16 Million Withdrawal’ On Saturday, August 26, one of the anonymous developers behind the Pepe project shed more light on the mysterious $16 million withdrawal from the project’s multi-sig wallet via a post on the official X (formerly Twitter) account. Related Reading: XRP Epic Price Setup: Accumulation Surge Paves The Way For Imminent Price Blast According to the team member, three ex-team members initiated a series of unexpected withdrawal transactions and transferred the “stolen” Pepe tokens to various crypto exchanges. A part of the community address explained: The multi-sig (wallet) was set up to require 3/4 signers present for an approval. Yesterday these 3 ex-team members came back behind my back, logged onto the multi-sig, stole 16 Trillion/ 60% of the 26 trillion multi-sig tokens, and sent them to exchanges to sale. They then removed themselves from the multi sig in an attempt to absolve any association to $PEPE, deleting all of their social accounts and leaving me behind nothing but a message stating “the multi-sig (wallet) has been updated, you are now in full control.” The anonymous developer established that these former members have been difficult to work with since the inception of the Pepe project. “There has often been conflict, and the majority of the team involved in $PEPE creation started to distance themselves after the first week of project inception”, they said. While apologizing for the inconvenience and losses caused by the “bad actors,” the project member claims that the remaining 10 trillion Pepe tokens in the multi-sig are “safe” and out of the reach of “nefarious” ex-team members. Unsurprisingly, the online crypto community had mixed reactions to the project developer’s address. While some individuals seemed convinced by the team member’s account, others raised questions about the sincerity of the claims. PEPE Jumps By Nearly 10% – Is A Recovery On? The value of PEPE reacted positively to this address, surging by about 9.6% to reach $0.000000956641. Although it has experienced some correction, the meme coin’s price is still well (roughly 9%) above its seven-day low of $0.000000824545 reached in the early hours of Friday, August 25. As inferred earlier, panic-induced selling was primarily responsible for the recent PEPE price crash. With confidence seemingly restored, investors will likely be banking on a price recovery.

When in the oversold region, the RSI often signals that a trend reversal is on the horizon. According to CoinGecko data, PEPE currently trades at $0.000000898317, registering a 1.4% price jump in the last 24 hours. With a market cap of roughly $375.9, the meme coin is the 97th-largest cryptocurrency on the market.

16593616,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549003,1693083655,"PEPE Whale Exits After Making Over 54,000x Gain And $1.73 Million In Profit","One of PEPE’s early adopters is officially out after making over $1.7 million in profit, translating to a 54,725x gain in less than six months. In a tweet shared by Lookonchain on August 26, the meme coin trader bought 1.69 trillion tokens, spending roughly $36, minutes after the project was launched in late April 2023. However, by the time the trader exited, less than six months later, selling off all his tokens, he had realized a decent gain, raking in 1,001 ETH, or roughly $1.7 million at spot rates. PEPE Whale Exits Trackers reveal that the trader first sold 0.69 trillion before fully exiting and liquidating 1 trillion PEPE on August 26, pocketing $885,000 or 537 ETH, pushing his total haul to 1,001 ETH. Considering the pseudonymous nature of Ethereum from where PEPE started trading through Uniswap v3, the trader’s identity cannot be ascertained. PEPE is one of the more successful meme coin projects in 2023. The token’s meteoritic rise–and crash–over the past couple of months illustrates its volatility. For the project’s early success and popularity, because of traders buying in and aiming to ride the trend mainly because of fear of missing out (FOMO), PEPE ended up being listed on several cryptocurrency exchanges, with support by Binance being the highlight. Related Reading: XRP Price Faces Immense Sell Pressure That Could Trigger 20% Decline Less than a week after being listed on Binance, PEPE soared 800% in early May before gradually falling as sentiment turned negative and holders began exiting, taking profits. The token peaked at $0.0000044839 and have since crashed 81% to $0.0000008674 as of August 26. This price level is an important reaction point marking June 2023 lows and is a primary support level. If bears press on, PEPE may fall to retest $0.0000004984, the opening price when the token began trading when it was listed on Binance on May 1. Meme Coin Trending, Team Transfers Tokens While PEPE is a top-trending token on CoinMarketCap, a tracker owned by Binance, at the time of writing August 26, the whale opted to exit via Uniswap v3. Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) for trading multiple tokens, primarily those on Ethereum. It is the second last iteration of the DEX and uses concentrated liquidity. PEPE is also available on Uniswap v2, but most trading is concentrated on Binance and KuCoin, two of the world’s leading centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. Related Reading: JPMorgan Shares Prediction On Bitcoin’s Next Move: What You Need To Know On August 25, the team transferred 16.045 trillion tokens (worth $16.85 million) from their multisig address to four exchanges, including Binance, leaving out only 10.697 trillion PEPE. The transfer also coincided with the multisig parameter changes. Only two signatories will be required to effect a transfer, down from five out of eight.

He also stated that the Shiba Inu team plans to integrate a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) into Shibarium. Additionally, he said that the recently launched layer 2 blockchain has finally achieved a state of stability, ensuring users gain all the benefits of the mainnet including more options for BONE staking. “After two days of testing and tweaking parameters to achieve a ‘ready’ state, Shibarium is now enhanced and optimized. Additional validators will go live, giving even more options for you to stake your BONE,” Kusama said. SHIB Community Embraces Shibarium Relaunch And Modifications The SHIB army has been anticipating Shibarium’s release after the Ethereum layer 2 solution got off to a rocky start. The Shibarium mainnet halted its operations after its first launch and has been undergoing reconfigurations and testing to bolster its network. According to developers, the reason for the network’s suspension was due to the high traffic and overwhelming increase in adoption, with over 10 million new wallets registered on the platform. However, Kusama had reassured the SHIB community, stating that the mainnet was only going through a few tweaks and would be up and running soon, stronger than it was in its previous release. Shiba Inu’s price performance also declined slightly following Shibarium’s temporary shutdown. But the cryptocurrency is on a recovery trend presently and growing to be one of the trendiest meme coins in the crypto space.

16590287,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548999,1693076445,AVAX Dump Continues Despite Puma/Roc Nation Sneaker Launch On Avalanche,"AVAX, the native currency of the Avalanche blockchain, is trading at new 2023 lows at the time of writing on August 26. Trading at $10, the coin is down 55% from 2023 highs and roughly 25% alone in August 2023. At this pace, AVAX has not only broken mid-June 2023 lows but could break below the critical June 2021 support. AVAX Is Sinking A look at the daily candlestick arrangement in August shows that sellers have been unwavering and firm despite the general optimism amongst supporters. Of note, it is clear that the selling momentum has been strong. AVAX bear bars have been banding along the lower BB, meaning sellers have been unloading faster. At the same time, the divergence of the middle BB from the upper and lower BB suggests that AVAX prices have been volatile. This can be illustrated by the rapid contraction, especially in the second half of August when AVAX has shaved off over 20% of its value. The sell-off also comes amid a drop in trading activity and general liquidity, as volume indicators show in the daily chart. Comparing the current activity with those of early to mid-July 2023, it is evident that trading volumes have rapidly contracted. This drop may point to general apprehension as traders steer clear, considering the recent decline in valuation. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Community Burn Sees Another 350 Million Meme Coins Incinerated Typically, trading volumes are an indicator of interest, and in times of expanding prices, like in early July, AVAX trading volumes rose in tandem. The higher the trading volumes, the more liquid the token is since traders are more engaged and confident of the project’s prospects. Avalanche Vista And New Partnerships AVAX remains under pressure despite Avalanche Foundation partnering with Legitimate Technology, a web3 company, days after the foundation launched the “Avalanche Vista” program. The foundation aims to purchase real-world assets (RWAs) of up to $50 million minted on Avalanche. Following this, Legitimate joined forces with Puma and Roc Nation to bring the worlds of fashion and music on-chain.

16588594,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549011,1693072846,Base Chain TVL Surpasses Cardano As Interest Swells,"Ethereum Layer 2 network “Base” has surpassed Cardano in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL) in just two weeks after its official launch, despite Cardano experiencing a multi-year head start in growth and development. Base TVL And Trading Volume Rises Above Cardano Presently, Cardano is facing criticism from users due to its TVL falling below that of the newly launched project “Base” built by Coinbase. One individual who has publicly criticized the project is Evan Van Ness, a Consensys member and Ethereum advocate. Van Ness took to his X (formerly Twitter) account which boasts over 103,000 followers to call Cardano a “Zombie chain” because it was below Base by TVL despite being years ahead of the latter. Related Reading: This Ethereum Metric Has Sparked Centralization Concerns Over ETH Ownership Base was launched on August 9 and it has experienced impressive growth and momentum since it was introduced to the public. According to Data from DeFillama, the layer 2 network Base recorded a higher trading volume ($26.23 million) than that of the layer 1 network Cardano ($20 million) in less than 24 hours after its official launch. In terms of TVL, at the time Van Ness’s chart was shared on X, Base had managed to secure $188 million in TVL since it was introduced, surpassing Cardano which sat at the 14th position by TVL with $160 million. However, these figures have since been flipped especially since ADA is seeing a green day on Saturday. DefiLlama data currently shows a TVL of $188.46 million for Cardano versus $185.53 million for Base. Cardano TVL overtakes Base once more | Source: DeFiLlama Nevertheless, data from L2beat points Base’s rise in TVL over the past week puts it ahead of StarkNet and others which made it the fifth largest layer-2 network. Base TVL is, however, not the only impressive thing about the L2, as the network has outperformed Cardano by completing more transactions in its first week than Cardano’s transactions in a month. Although Base’s TPS may be lower than that of other layer 2 networks like Optimism (OP), investors and market observers believe that the network will experience more adoption as its ecosystem grows. Rising Average Transactions Per Second Base has recorded over 11 million transactions in less than a month since its official launch. Base’s average transactions per second over the past few days has been reported to be 15.88, surpassing other layer 2 blockchain Abritrum (AB) and Optimism (OP). The network’s 15.88 also shows an increase of almost 160% in daily Transactions Per Second (TPS).

Friend.tech is a social market that allows users to buy and sell shares in public figures. It has reportedly garnered more than 100,000 users since its release. Other protocols such as Synthenix have also shown interest in the Base network, as the protocol recently concluded a governance vote to deploy on Base.

Led by the renowned developer Shytoshi Kusama, the project encountered a stumbling block when scalability issues prompted the temporary suspension of the mainnet, dampening investor sentiment and impacting SHIB’s value. Unfortunately, the botched launch left its mark on SHIB’s price, contributing to a 4.9% drop over the course of a week. Despite this setback, there is a glimmer of hope evident in the coin’s minor recovery over the last 24 hours. SHIB managed to regain a 1.6% increase in value, trading at approximately $0.00000819 according to CoinGecko data. Related Reading: Tron Reverses August Slump As TRX Open Interest Climbs Nevertheless, this upturn remains overshadowed by the broader bearish sentiment that has enveloped the crypto market in recent days. SHIB Resistance Level And Price Analysis The current price level of SHIB holds paramount significance as it corresponds to a pivotal resistance point with a historical record of playing dual roles as both a support and a barrier. Delving into a price analysis reveals a repeated testing of this level, underscoring its importance. A decisive breach above or below this threshold could potentially herald the forthcoming trend direction for SHIB. Should SHIB muster the strength to overcome this resistance with notable trading volume, it might act as a catalyst for a fresh bullish surge. Traders and investors could interpret this breakthrough as a testament to the coin’s resilience, possibly fueling an increase in buying pressure. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.00000818. Chart: TradingView.com In such a scenario, the subsequent resistance levels to monitor would be the recent highs. Conversely, if SHIB falters in its ascent and encounters rejection, a further downward slide could ensue. Shibarium’s Trials And Triumphs In the midst of these price fluctuations, the development team has shed light on the challenges faced by Shibarium during its recent launch. Kusama clarified that the issues primarily arose from an unexpected deluge of transactions and users coinciding with the protocol’s announcement. He also vehemently denied rumors of any bridge-related problems, assuring the safety of investor funds. In the aftermath of the relaunch, Shibarium is demonstrating marked improvement. Block times have been trimmed to a mere five seconds, accompanied by a surge in processed transactions, surpassing the 100,000 mark. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Community Burn Sees Another 350 Million Meme Coins Incinerated Moreover, the project’s user base is expanding, with wallets approaching 45,000, indicating a growing interest in the platform’s capabilities. SHIB’s journey has been one marked by resilience and challenges, with the reintroduction of Shibarium poised as a turning point. As the coin grapples with a defining resistance level, market participants remain keenly observant, awaiting cues to decipher its potential trajectory.

16585246,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=548984,1693065627,$6.4 Million Lost In Latest Base-Native DeFi Protocol Rug Pull,"Magnate Finance, a DeFi lending protocol on the Ethereum layer-2 network Base, is reported to have conducted a rug pull, robbing its users of $6.4 million worth of assets. This event represents the latest troubling incident on the Base network in merely a month of its official mainnet launch. Related Reading: BALD Deployer Moves Proceeds Of The Rug From Base To Ethereum 3 Rug Pulls, $16.7 Million Lost – Who’s Responsible? On Friday, August 25, blockchain security intelligence Peckshield confirmed Magnate Finance’s rug pull, stating that the project developers manipulated the provider of the price oracle, allowing them to withdraw all assets of the platform. Peckshield also provided more information on the scammers’ movement, stating that they had transferred $1.34 worth of DAI to a new address while also bridging $1 million of the loot to the BNB chain. The majority of the stolen funds have been transferred to other Ethereum layer 2 solutions such as Optimism and Arbitrum. Meanwhile, the $1.3 million DAI and an additional 295 ETH, valued at around $486,000, remain on the Base Network. Interestingly, a few hours before the Magnate Finance rug pull occurred, an X user and on-chain investigator, ZachXBT, posted a community alert stating the possibility of such an event. ZachXBT’s suspicion was based on the fact that the deployer address of Magnate Finance received some funds from the Solifire’s $4.8 million rug pull that occurred in January 2022. In addition, the deployer address of Magnate Finance is also linked to the Kokomo Finance $5.5 million exit scam in March 2023. In total, the developers of the Base DeFi lending protocol have been involved in three rug pulls that have resulted in the loss of $16.7 million of user funds. At the time of writing, Magnate Finance has deleted its Telegram group, as well as disabled its official website. In addition, the project’s X account has also been deactivated, wiping all of its online and social media presence in what has been a “classic rug pull.” Related Reading: Base TVL Surges 900% In 2 Weeks, What’s Driving The Growth? Another Setback For Base? The early days of the Base Network in the crypto space have been anything but smooth sailing. Prior to the network’s public launch on August 9, BALD, a memecoin project on the Coinbase native network, was exposed as a rug pull after developers withdrew $25.6 million of the project’s liquidity. Since then, there have been more negative occurrences within the Base ecosystem, with the Rocketswap DEX losing over $450,000 via “brute force hack,” while 342 ETH, valued at $626,000, has also been stolen from LeetSwap, another Base-native DEX. However, it is worth stating that the Base Network has also recorded some positives in its short time of operation. According to data from L2Beat data, Base ranks as the fourth most active layer two solution with a daily transaction per second value of 7.73. In addition, where the general total DeFi ecosystem has taken a dive below the $40 billion mark, Base has shown much resilience. Using data from DefiiLama, the project’s TVL gained by 11.02% in the last week and is now valued at $185.81 million.

When big money moves into cold storage, it reduces selling pressure because it often indicates that whales and institutional investors are expecting the price to go up and opting for self-custody. Massive Exodus Of BTC To Cold Storage Data from CoinGlass shows that almost 30,000 BTC have been moved off exchanges in the past week. With Bitcoin currently trading around $26,000, this equates to over $780 million moved into cold storage.

Investors use cold wallets to hold Bitcoin long-term as a way to accumulate their assets. For many long-term holders, this is a safer option than keeping large amounts of crypto on an exchange which could be at higher risk of hacks or scams. BTC price sitting above $26,000 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com How Is This Bullish For The Price Of Bitcoin? Bitcoin into cold storage points to a bullish outlook from serious investors. It reduces selling pressure since the amount of BTC available for sale on exchanges has become smaller. According to the economic principles of supply and demand, the lower supply is poised to lead to higher prices. Related Reading: Here’s Why Arthur Hayes Is Not In Support Of A BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF While it’s not entirely clear what is causing this transition, the timing of this movement to cold storage is also notable. The SEC’s decision on spot Bitcoin ETF applications is imminent, and many believe that approval would lead to a spike in the price of Bitcoin. However, the regulator can still delay the applications for up to 240 days. The price of Bitcoin has gone through a considerable dip in the past month as the market reacted to various news. At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $26,000 and is down by 11.83% in the past month but up by 0.42% in a 7-day timeframe. This would suggest that the movement into cold storage has not had a significant effect, as the price of Bitcoin is still struggling to recover.

This technical formation, often seen as a potential trend reversal indicator, has stirred discussions about the future trajectory of SOL’s value. A falling wedge pattern is a common chart pattern in technical analysis, characterized by a contracting range between two trendlines that slope in the same direction. The upper trendline, representing the declining highs, converges with the lower trendline, formed by the decreasing lows. This pattern suggests a potential bullish reversal, as the price reaches a point of consolidation, leading to an eventual breakout to the upside. Image: Bybit Learn Related Reading: Tron Reverses August Slump As TRX Open Interest Climbs Solana Vies For Bullish Upswing As SOL’s price continues to exhibit this falling wedge pattern, analysts are eyeing a potential bullish upswing in the near future. The recent retest of the lower trendline has intensified demand pressures, potentially setting the stage for a breakout. Price analysis projections point towards a potential recovery that could take SOL’s value towards the overhead trendline or even the $21.55 mark. However, the validity of this pattern relies on the integrity of the two trendlines. While the falling wedge pattern suggests a bullish outlook, a failure to maintain these trendlines could lead to further downward movement. Investors and traders remain cautious, recognizing that as long as the pattern holds, there is a risk of SOL’s value prolonging its descent and potentially reaching the $16 mark. Recent market data from CoinGecko paints a mixed picture, with SOL’s price at $20.32, reflecting a 2.8% decline over the last 24 hours and a 5.2% slump over the past seven days. These fluctuations highlight the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency market and the impact of various factors on asset prices. Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $20.27.

The ups and downs in this digital money landscape have caused the value of many coins connected to SHIB to drop, making things a bit shaky. But here’s something good: the SHIB token burn is happening faster than before. This means they’re getting rid of more tokens, which is a positive thing. It’s like a bright spot in the midst of all these changes, showing that there’s something strong and good still happening in the SHIB world. Based on the data provided by the Shibburn explorer, it is evident that the SHIB community has been effectively engaging in the process of burning substantial quantities of these meme coins, thereby transferring them to wallets that are rendered unspendable. Related Reading: Tron Reverses August Slump As TRX Open Interest Climbs Shiba Inu: Optimism Amid Market Volatility Even though the SHIB token has had some failures and its price has gone down, its burn rate has gone up by about 80% in the last 24 hours, according to Shibburn. Today, the SHIB army has successfully facilitated the removal of around 350 million Shiba Inu meme coins, which were previously rendered inaccessible and excluded from circulation. Source: Shibburn Last week, over 1.84 billion SHIB tokens were burned in approximately 255 transitions, according to Shibburn. This reduced the weekly SHIB consumption rate by 38.76%. It took 19 transfers for the community to successfully remove 349,012,147 SHIB during the course of the last 24 hours. Burns frequently involved two or three SHIB pieces and occurred virtually hourly. Increasing Scarcity And Value Burning tokens, or reducing the supply of a cryptocurrency, is a common practice in the blockchain and crypto communities. As the number of coins in circulation increases, both their demand and value tend to decrease. This activity is considered a deliberate method to increasing scarcity, which may lead to an increase in the value of the remaining tokens. This strategy is especially significant for Shiba Inu because of their abundant starting supply. SHIB market cap currently at $4.8 billion.

16573142,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/magnate-finance-orchestrates-rug-pull-over-6-million-stolen,1693041058,"Magnate Finance Orchestrates Rug Pull, Over $6 Million Stolen","Magnate Finance, a lending and borrowing protocol that operates on the Ethereum Layer-2 network Base, has apparently orchestrated a rug pull, stealing millions from users of the protocol. The rug pull had been predicted by on-chain sleuths, including ZachXBT, who cited several previous actions of the project’s founders. Details Of The Rug Pull Magnate Finance has also effectively cleared its entire digital presence, having deleted its Telegram group on the 25th of August. It also took its website offline, rendering it inaccessible on the same day. The protocol later deleted its X (formerly Twitter) account as well, effectively erasing its entire digital and social media presence. Mere hours after deleting its entire social media presence, Magnate Finance developers manipulated the price oracle of the protocol. This let them remove all assets within the protocol, removing around $6.4 million of the total value locked (TVL) in the protocol, effectively collapsing the project. Security firm PeckShield called this occurrence a classic rug pull and also conducted an investigation into the situation. The security firm stated that the developers behind the project transferred around $1.34 million worth of DAI tokens to a new address. Later, they bridged around $1 million of the stolen funds to the BNB Smart Chain. The firm also tracked five different wallets, all of which were linked to the Magnate Finance scammers. PeckShield added that the scammers had manually manipulated the price oracle, allowing them to drain funds. A majority of the stolen funds went to several Ethereum Layer-2 platforms, such as Optimism and Arbitrum, along with the BNB Smart Chain using Stargate. Around 295 ETH and 1.3 million DAI tokens are currently held on the Base chain. ZachXBT Had Warned Of Potential Exit Scam The Magnate Finance rug pull came to light after a warning issued by on-chain investigator ZachXBT. ZachXBT had issued a warning that the developers behind the Magnate Finance protocol could orchestrate an exit scam. The on-chain investigator reached this conclusion after discovering that the Magnate Finance deployer address was linked to a previous exit scam involving a project called Solfire. Solfire defrauded its users of around $4.8 million. “Community Alert: Magnate Finance on Base will likely exit scam in the near future currently with over $6.4M TVL. The deployers address is directly linked to the Solfire $4.8M exit scam.” The Problem Of Exit Scams Exit scams and rug pulls have become a considerable problem in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, with scammers using them as their preferred tactic. The Magnate Finance rug pull is the second rug pull this month, with the SwirlLend rug pull occurring earlier. SwirlLend, another protocol on Base, stole around $460,000 in an exit scam, with some funds also stolen on Linea. PeckShield, in an analysis of the rug pull, stated that the SwirlLend team drained $290,000 worth of crypto assets from Base and a further $170,000 worth of assets from Linea. Like Magnate Finance, SwirlLend has also completely erased its digital presence, with its social media accounts on Twitter and Telegram deleted and the website rendered inaccessible. The scourge of rug pulls, and exit scams is evident from the total value of cryptocurrencies lost to them in the first half of 2023. According to blockchain security firm Beosin, phishing scams and rug pulls have resulted in the loss of a staggering $655 million so far. “Total losses from hacks, phishing scams, and rug pulls in #Web3 amounted to a staggering $655.61M in H1 2023. Out of this, 108 attacks resulted in a loss of ~$471.43M. Phishing scams accounted for around $108M of losses, while 110 #rugpulls resulted in a total loss of ~$75.87M.” Growing Problems On Base Chain Coinbase’s Layer-2 blockchain has faced several problems since it commenced operations. RocketSwap, a project on Base, fell victim to a brute force attack, which saw around 471 ETH, valued at about $865,000 stolen. The protocol outlined an emergency plan following the attack and would also attempt to reach out to the hackers to negotiate a return of the stolen assets. Another project on Base, the decentralized exchange LeetSwap, also had to suspend trading operations thanks to fears of a potential exploit. The decentralized exchange tweeted that it had detected a security vulnerability and had to stop trading for further investigations. Additionally, Coinbase and Base are also dealing with the aftermath of an SEC lawsuit. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.
