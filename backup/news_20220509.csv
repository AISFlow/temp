45414,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=234975,1652139002,Is The NFT Market Collapsing? What Does the Data Say?,"According to a report by market research firm Nonfungible, the NFT market as a whole is on the verge of collapse. This conclusion was a result of the 92% decline in NFT sales since September 2021. What&apos;s going on? These three terms could describe the current state of the NFT industry&apos;s press coverage. Apart from this, there are so many reports of the NFT market collapsing right now. If you merely look at the last four weeks, it becomes evident how shocking these claims are. The NFT market is growing at a rate that is far greater than that of cryptocurrencies, according to this analysis. But now, things appear to have changed. This means that the total was 103.7 percent more than expected, which is remarkable. The past performance in 2022 shows how obvious this rise is when compared to Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency. Only 1.9 percent was affected. What are NFTs? &apos;Non-Fungible Token&apos; is the abbreviation for this technology. In the digital world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks, a token serves as proof of ownership. As such, in the cryptosphere, an NFT serves as a kind of title deed or authentication certificate. The Metaverse&apos;s virtual trade market relies heavily on ownership evidence like this. Because of the ease with which they may be copied or reproduced, digital products would be less appealing to sellers if they didn&apos;t have this feature.

42435422,z5xashhl2ItpefZwyLxr5B,1652138589,Instagram Eyes Creator Economy With NFT Rollout,"Instagram’s non-fungible token (NFT) pilot is the first play in a creator monetization strategy that’s still taking shape.  Shortly after unveiling its “Digital Collectibles” product Monday, the Meta (FB)-owned social media platform signaled its interest in turning NFTs into a revenue stream for the creators catering to the platform's billion-plus user base.  Figuring out how to leverage that base is to be determined. At launch, Instagram’s NFT pilot will merely allow a handful of creators to share their digital art on the platform – no sales, trading or fees involved.  Money will ultimately be part of the mix. In a job posting for Creator Blockchain Experiences on Monday, Instagram called for help to “define the strategy and roadmap for new blockchain-enabled creator monetization experiences.”  Creators could use blockchain tech “to build connections with their fans that are meaningful, monetizable and recognized anywhere,” the job post said. The product manager’s mission will be to help Instagram figure out how.  Jon Victor, who runs Web 3 and NFT strategy for crypto startup Protocol Labs, said that millions of users on Instagram and other social media platforms already sell merchandise and brand partnerships to their followers in the multibillion-dollar creator economy.  Not everyone will want NFTs, Victor cautioned. He cited the mainstream gamer backlash Ubisoft triggered with its botched entrance to NFTs early this year. That might explain why Instagram is limiting its pilot at the start to just a handful of creators and collectors.  Getting these creators onboard with NFTs will click with some of their fans, maybe just 1% to 2%. Given Instagram’s immense size (its user base extends into the billions) that still translates to a massive business proposition for Meta and its creators.  “You’re seeing organic communities form around NFTs,” he said, citing the PFP market as one example. “It makes sense that this idea can be extended to creators that are already building their own communities.”  Instagram declined to comment for this article but directed CoinDesk to recent statements from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg promoting the platform’s need to “lean into all the different ways that creators could make money” including via NFTs.  Top brass at Meta have hammered at the ‘creator first’ messaging in recent months with Zuckerberg calling the monetization initiative critical to “set our services apart” in the April recent earnings call.  “One of the challenging things that we need to solve as an industry is how to help creators make a living doing what they love,” said Instagram chief Adam Mosseri in a video announcing the pilot.  Mosseri cautioned that digital collectibles wouldn’t resonate with everyone. But the “subset of creators” who want it could leverage the opportunity in meaningful, monetizable ways, he said.  One such creator, a street artist who goes by Masnah.eth on social media, generates income by painting customers’ larger-than-life “PFP” NFTs on the side of buildings – work he shares on Instagram.  Masnah.eth hesitated to throw himself into Instagram’s visions of an NFT-based creator economy, partly because it's too early to tell what form the initiative will take. “I gotta read thoroughly!” he said in a twitter message.  Regardless, he said he’s not yet convinced.  “I don’t see why I would” pursue creator monetization on Instagram, said Masnah.eth, who already sells the rights to future street commissions as NFTs. “Doesn’t really make sense to me.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/09/instagram-eyes-creator-economy-with-nft-rollout,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/56453a2e6db3c22213e237056935b08c68f8e043-612x396.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Although there was a period where it had tapered off, it had continued to rise once more. The culmination of this has been a massive inflow into various centralized exchanges, presumably for investors to sell off their coins. Now the inflows have hit a new three-month high, painting a rather grim picture for the future of the digital asset. Inflows Take Over Bitcoin investors have been dumping their holdings since the digital asset started its descent from its $69,000 all-time high. Although outflows had rivaled inflows, the rate at which BTC was flowing into exchanges remained a cause for alarm. In a chart posted by Glasnode Alerts, it shows how inflows have been moving in relation to price. Following the historical pattern of inflows increasing when the price is down, the market had seen more and more bitcoins moved onto exchanges for sale.

42435466,z5xashhl2ItpefZwyLxrOT,1652136086,First Mover Asia: Did Nvidia Profit From Crypto Mining? Consider Its Manufacturing Partners’ Stocks; Cryptos Have a Rough Day,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and other major cryptos plummet.  Insights: Nvidia has a peevish relationship with the crypto industry.  Technician's take: BTC's breakdown is confirmed and upside appears limited.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $31,199 -8.5%  Ether (ETH): $2,305 -8.8%  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Algorand ALGO −15.7% Smart Contract Platform Litecoin LTC −15.1% Currency Cardano ADA −15.0% Smart Contract Platform  Another difficult day for cryptos  And the beatdown goes on.  Bitcoin continued to spiral in Monday trading, dropping to levels it hasn't seen since early July and is at less than half its price in late November when it approached $70,000.  The euphoria of wider adoption and growing institutional interest coupled with growing awareness of blockchain-fueled projects has long since evaporated, replaced by fear of higher interest rates, geopolitical turmoil and a looming recession. The largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently trading at just over $31,000 after dropping well below that threshold earlier in the day. But bitcoin's more than 8.5% plunge over the past 24 hours was better than most major cryptocurrencies fared on Monday as investors fled assets with even an inkling of risk. The riskier the asset the faster the exit.  Terra's LUNA token was off more than 30% over the same period after the Luna Foundation Guard, the Singapore-based, non-profit established to support the Terra network, tweeted that would loan $1.5 billion in bitcoin (BTC) and terraUSD (UST) to defend the peg of its algorithmic stablecoin to the U.S. dollar. CRO tumbled more than 16% at one point. ADA and DOT were off about 14%.  Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was more resilient, roughly mirroring BTC's more modest drop. Trading volume increased slightly, reflecting the pickup in sellers' activity, although it remained well off 2022 highs earlier in the year. The Fear & Greed index remained in the extreme fear range where it has spent the past month amid investors' growing concerns about inflation, central bank monetary hawkishness that could send the global economy into recession and the widening aftershocks of Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Daily, weekly and monthly charts for bitcoin have all trended negative.  Crypto's bloodbath tracked steep declines in equity markets with the tech-focused Nasdaq dropping over 4.3% and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 3.2% and nearly 2%, respectively. Even gold, a safe-haven asset that typically rises in stressful periods, declined 1.5%.  Mark Lurie, the CEO of crypto trading software provider Shipyard Software, noted the impact of Terra's announcement, but called it ""noise relative to the macro story"" that has sucked in ""growth assets,"" including Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet's (GOOG) Google and some of the biggest names in technology.  ""This macro drop is probably for two converging reasons,""  Lurie wrote that the macro drop was due to rising interest rates that were making ""safer assets more attractive"" and pulling ""capital from growth stocks."" But he also highlighted the easing of pandemic restrictions that has reduced consumers' reliance on technology. ""Many people are returning to offline buying behaviors, hurting e-commerce and tech stocks that did the best during lockdowns,"" he wrote.  Markets  S&P 500: 3,991 -3.2%  DJIA: 32,245 -1.9%  Nasdaq: 11,623 -4.2%  Gold: $1,852 -1.5%  Insights  Here's why Nvidia downplayed its mining business  Nvidia (NVDA) has always had a testy relationship with crypto and its decision to re-write history cost the company $5.5 million.  In the late 2000s, its Graphics Processing Units (GPU), built primarily with gaming in mind, found a second life: Their ability to do parallel processing, used to create photo-realistic graphics for games, meant they could crunch through large amounts of data with ease, launching a new world of computing.  General Purpose GPU Compute, or GPGPU compute, is responsible for the AI and Big Data boom. These GPUs were a requirement for virtually every data center, and Nvidia’s stock rose like a rocket with this demand.  GPGPU also meant that GPUs were essential for mining crypto. First bitcoin and then ether.  As we all know, the demand caused a massive shortage of graphics cards throughout the first crypto boom of 2016-2018. Gamers and PC enthusiasts were annoyed because the latest gen cards were impossible to find, meaning that they had to game with yesterday’s tech.  And Nvidia did all it could to write this out of history. While Nvidia makes a specialized mining card, it strongly discourages mining with its regular gaming cards and tries to disable the ability to mine with them. This leads to a back and forth between the company and miners that try and break this lock.  Nvidia’s annoyance with mining also resulted in its downplaying the impact it had on its business in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings and attributing it to gaming.  This was a strange decision on Nvidia’s part because crypto’s fluctuations were easy to see on the stock prices of its graphics card manufacturing partners in Asia. Shipments of new high-end motherboards, a key component for PCs, didn’t seem to be in sync with the insatiable demand the market had for GPUs, suggesting it wasn’t high-end gaming PCs the market wanted but only one component.  While Nvidia designs the GPU at the core of a graphics card, companies in Taiwan manufacture the board these cards are attached to called a “graphics card” (sometimes called an add-in board by analysts).  Gigabyte, Micro-Star International (MSI), and Zotac (its parent is listed in Hong Kong as PC Partner Group) are some of the biggest names in the business. Usually, these are relatively boring stocks because they are manufacturing companies that are at the behest of chip designers like Nvidia.  It is Nvidia, not Gigabyte, that makes the proprietary and valuable part of a graphics card, and the relatively low income and profit margins for Gigabyte reflect this.  The fortunes of these companies changed during the crypto boom of 2017-2018. Miners then needed every graphics card they could get their hands on to profit from the then-nascent Ethereum protocol and its role in the initial coin offering (ICO) bubble.  Investors hungry for exposure to the market bought all the stock they could of Gigabyte, MSI (2377) and PC Partner (1263). The number of investment vehicles for crypto then were limited as registered crypto custodians didn’t exist at the time. In November 2017, Bloomberg specifically called out these stocks as opportunities for investors seeking a macro proxy for crypto.  Eventually, the ICO bubble burst and a crypto crash happened. Students of bitcoin’s history know that the crypto winter of 2018 was a particularly chilly one as prices dropped significantly and didn’t recover for a long time.  Gigabyte, MSI and PC Partner’s stocks deflated as fast as they rose. Demand from mining companies evaporated overnight, and analysts warned that these companies would be in a tough position with layoffs and restructuring. Nvidia called this a “crypto hangover” as it took a $23 billion write-down on excess inventory that it just couldn’t move. Nvidia-competitor AMD (AMD) had the same problem.  Although crypto’s material impact on Nvidia’s bottom line was patently clear to informed observers (it's not clear why the SEC is dealing with this only now), the company still tried to hide it. Its decision is likely because its data center and enterprise businesses proved to be stalwart pillars of revenue, and the company didn’t want investors to be spooked.  The question is, as we head into another crypto winter, will history repeat itself?  Technician's take  Bitcoin Under Pressure; Support at $27K-$30K  Bitcoin (BTC) confirmed a break below its short-term uptrend and is now targeting lower support at $27,000 and $30,000. Sellers could remain active given the loss of upside momentum on the daily, weekly and monthly charts.  BTC was down by as much as 11% over the past 24 hours and 20% over the past week.  Further, bitcoin is roughly 50% below its all-time high near $69,000, achieved in November of last year, compared to an 80% peak-to-trough decline during the 2018 crypto bear market. At this point, price action does not indicate a major cycle low.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is the most oversold since Jan. 24, which preceded a relief rally. This time, however, BTC is at risk of breaking below its year-long price range, which means buyers could continue to take profits on short-term recoveries.

Ethereum was introduced as an open-source software platform that enables developers to create coins and other digital applications. Ethereum refers to a decentralized, distributed electronic ledger that records all transactions. Ledgers are the backbone of cryptographic monetary transactions. Ether, a token generated by the Ethereum blockchain, is the Ethereum cryptocurrency. Using a blockchain makes it almost impossible to falsify anything stored on it. Currently, these tokens are &apos;mined&apos; by computers solving mathematical puzzles, similar to how Bitcoin is mined. In the last year, both retail and institutional investors have embraced Ethereum. Why should an investor purchase Ethereum? eToro argues that trading or exchanging Ethereum for other cryptocurrencies is straightforward. According to the broker, an increasing number of online and offline firms will take bitcoin. In comparison to Bitcoin, there is significantly lower transaction time, and dApps (decentralized applications) make it possible for developers to build new online services.

Following a Twitter announcement by the Central American President, it was revealed on Monday that El Salvador&apos;s government had once again dug into the country&apos;s financial resources to acquire an extra 500 units of Bitcoin. This most recent purchase makes it the country&apos;s largest purchase to date of the cryptocurrency. The average price El Salvador paid, according to Bukele, was $30,744 per bitcoin, amounting to around $15 million in total. El Salvador was the first nation to recognize bitcoin as legal tender, having done so in September of last year. Owing to the president&apos;s persistent conviction in Bitcoin, the government has made it a point to purchase the cryptocurrency whenever the market price is down. Most recently, on January 21, the government purchased 410 bitcoins at an average price of $36,585. El Salvador now looks to be in possession of around 2,301 bitcoins, which are now valued at around $71 million.

42435432,z5xashhl2ItpefZwyLxrIX,1652133091,New Fed Report Repeats Warning About Stablecoin Run Risks as UST Loses Peg,"The U.S. government is continuing to cast stablecoins as a potential threat to the stability of the financial system, with both the Federal Reserve and a senior Treasury official saying Monday the tokens could experience dangerous customer runs.  As government officials expressed their doubts about the sector, terraUSD (UST), which burns and mints its sister token LUNA to absorb shocks to its price, lost its peg to the dollar on Monday for a second time in three days. UST, one of the top stablecoins in circulation, dropped well below $0.85 at one point late Monday.  The Fed's latest ""Financial Stability Report"" issued a potentially well-timed warning that the risk of sudden, desperate redemptions of stablecoins – crypto tokens pegged to the value of another asset like the dollar – is akin to the risk of runs in money-market funds.  The report, which included a similar warning in the most recent version in November, is a biannual publication the Fed produces to assess ongoing risks to the stability of the U.S. financial system.  “These vulnerabilities may be exacerbated by a lack of transparency regarding the riskiness and liquidity of assets backing stablecoins,” according to the report, which noted that the market is concentrated with more than 80% of its activity in three names: tether (USDT), USDC and binance USD (BUSD).  The documents also flagged a worry not detailed previously that “the increasing use of stablecoins to meet margin requirements for levered trading in other cryptocurrencies may amplify volatility.”  On the same day, Nellie Liang, the Treasury Department’s undersecretary for Domestic Finance, spoke about stablecoins at an event hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.  “They have the potential to generate destabilizing runs if the value of the assets backing the stablecoin decline abruptly,” said Liang, who has been leading the Treasury’s work to determine how the federal government should oversee digital assets. She also said that stablecoins may “introduce novel risk – payment system risk – related to the distributed ledger technology.”  U.S. regulators, including Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, have sometimes compared stablecoins to money-market funds. Investors in money markets are similarly supposed to be able to count on getting a dollar back for each dollar invested, though the short-term investment funds are also meant to provide an additional small return.  In the 2008 financial collapse, the Reserve Primary Fund became one of the first retail money market funds to ""break the buck"" by slipping below $1 to $0.97 a share. The entire industry convulsed in response and the government stepped in to back the funds.

42435433,z5xashhl2ItpefZwyLxrMz,1652128543,Investors Flee Terra’s Anchor as UST Stablecoin Repeatedly Loses $1 Peg,"Anchor, the yield-generating protocol built on the Terra blockchain, saw some $5 billion of deposits, or more than a third of the total, vanish over the past few days in what is the equivalent of a crypto-style bank run on one of the blockchain industry's most popular projects.  Deposits on Anchor, which offered up to 19.5% yield on deposits, plunged to $8.7 billion on Monday from $14 billion on Friday, data by the protocol’s dashboard shows.  The deposits into the blockchain-based protocol are mostly in Terra's dollar-pegged stablecoin, terraUSD (UST).  In recent days, the stablecoin has lost its dollar peg repeatedly in what appears to be a crisis of confidence among some traders and investors.  “There were some pretty wild things going on in the Terra ecosystem last night, particularly around $UST depegging,"" David Shuttleworth, DeFi economist at ConsenSys, said to CoinDesk in an email. “This triggered some market panic and caused users to withdraw from Anchor.”  Terra’s stablecoin and the financial system built around it are under pressure as UST has lost its dollar peg twice in just three days. UST is the largest algorithmic stablecoin, a type of dollar-pegged cryptocurrency that is not backed by assets and maintains its price by creating and destroying supply through a swap with another token, in this case, luna (LUNA).  Investors flocked to the Anchor protocol to gain from double-digit yields, catapulting the circulating supply of UST from $2 billion to a high of $18.5 billion in a year, as investors needed UST to deposit. Critics called out the protocol’s high yield for being unsustainable because interest revenue from borrows did not cover yield payouts and required an outside source to replenish the reserves. Mirror Tracker shows that the Anchor Yield Reserve is on track to be depleted in as soon as a month, falling to $176 million from $323 million in the last 30 days.  Ryan Clements, a professor at the University of Calgary, said algorithmic stablecoins are inherently vulnerable to losing their peg to the downside and falling to a death spiral if investors lose faith in the price stability.  To address fears, Terra-developer firm Terraform Labs and other investors created a forex reserve called the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) to backstop UST in case of market volatility. LFG reserves stood at around $3.5 billion after it acquired $1.5 billion in bitcoin (BTC) on Friday.  After UST fell to $0.98 during the weekend, the LFG announced that it will lend $1.5 billion in BTC and UST to defend the peg of its algorithmic stablecoin to the U.S. dollar.  ANC, the Anchor protocol’s governance token that offers a percentage of the protocol revenue, fell 35% in 24 hours and is down by 87% from its all-time high reached on March 19, 2021, according to CoinGecko.

42435440,z5xashhl2ItpefZwyLxrSv,1652128144,"Market Wrap: Cryptos, Stocks Tumble Amid Extreme Bearish Sentiment","Selling pressure intensified in both cryptos and stocks on Monday as investors continue to reduce their exposure to speculative assets.  Bitcoin (BTC) dipped toward $30,000 for the first time since July of last year. Technical indicators show support between $27,000 and $30,000, which is the bottom of a year-long price range. Still, negative momentum on the daily, weekly and monthly charts means BTC is at risk of additional breakdowns, similar to what occurred during the 2018 crypto bear market.  Most alternative cryptos (altcoins) underperformed bitcoin on Monday, which typically occurs in a down market. For example, Polkadot's DOT token, Decentraland's MANA token, and Dogecoin's DOGE were all down by more than 17% over the past 24 hours, compared with an 11% drop in BTC over the same period.  Just launched! Please sign up for our daily Market Wrap newsletter explaining what happens in crypto markets – and why.  Meanwhile, the S&P 500 reached new lows for the year as tech stocks continued to underperform.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), a popular measure of the stock market's expectation of volatility based on S&P 500 index options, has been elevated over the past few months, reversing its downtrend from March 2020 highs. That means further price swings are likely, which typically forces traders to hedge against downside risk.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $31,302, −9.48%    ●Ether (ETH): $2,297, −10.28%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $3,991, −3.20%    ●Gold: $1,853 per troy ounce, −1.51%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.08%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  No capitulation yet  The bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is at the lowest point since January 24, which marked a temporary price low for bitcoin around $32,900.  The index has remained in ""extreme fear"" territory over the past month as traders grappled with macroeconomic and geopolitical risks. Still, the index can remain in the ""fear"" zone for a few months before an upside in price occurs. For example, in 2018 the index moved erratically between ""fear"" and ""greed"" levels for a full year before BTC's price exited a bear market phase.  For reference, BTC had a peak-to-trough decline of 80% in 2018, compared with its current 50% drop from its all-time high around $69,000 reached in November of last year.  Other market indicators show no signs of capitulation among sellers yet. For example, bitcoin's volume ticked higher over the past 24 hours but remains below its Jan. 24 peak, according to CoinDesk data.  Further, short-term bitcoin holders continue to dominate selling behavior. The volume of BTC selling, however, is not as extreme compared with earlier this year, according to blockchain data reviewed by CryptoQuant.  So far, El Salvador has bought the dip, which previously occurred around major price drops over the past year.  Bitcoin realized price at $24K  Some analysts expect BTC to eventually stabilize at lower price levels, with some estimating between $24,000 and $27,000.  The chart below shows the average realized price (average cost basis among traders) at $24,300. Historically, realized price levels have marked price lows, which preceded long trading ranges or a strong uptrend in price.  Glassnode data also compares BTC's market price to its realized price (MVRV ratio), which does not signal capitulation. A move toward $24,000, however, could push the MVRV ratio into oversold territory.  From a technical perspective, BTC confirmed a breakdown below $40,000 last week, which could yield an initial downside target toward $27,200, according to Katie Stockton, managing partner at Fairlead Strategies.  Altcoin roundup  Trouble in Terra land: UST, Terra blockchain’s stablecoin, lost its dollar peg twice over the past 48 hours, falling to as low as $0.98 Monday. UST is the largest algorithmic stablecoin, with a $18 billion market capitalization, and it uses the LUNA token to absorb any price deviation from the $1 peg. However, critics say UST's design is inherently flawed and vulnerable to attacks. After the de-peg, LUNA fell sharply to $51.3, down by 50% over the past month. Read more here.  DeFi tokens sink: The locked value on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols fell to a yearly low as it lost some $27 billion over the past weekend. Curve, a stablecoin swap platform and the largest DeFi protocol by total value locked (TVL), fell nearly 10% in value in the past week, while Lido, the largest staking service, saw a 13% drop and Terra’s Anchor took a 21% fall. The drop is likely due to falling token prices and risk-off sentiment in the broader market. Read more here.  S&P rates Compound: Decentralized finance platform Compound’s enterprise arm, Compound Treasury, received a B- rating from the coveted credit rating agency S&P Global. It appears to be the first time an ""institutional DeFi"" product has been scored by one of the major credit rating agencies, and Compound Treasury’s Reid Cuming said it is a sign that interest from institutional investors is growing towards DeFi.

Besides the import and export of raw commodities, average folks may now shop online at companies all over the world, further compressing the global economic domain. The introduction and rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies over the last decade have also had massive ramifications for global trade and business, some of which may endanger the current system as we know it. Cryptocurrency in Global Trade Every nation on the planet has some form of natural resource or another, as well as commodities. At the same time, no nation on the planet possesses every natural resource or product required to function, necessitating global commerce. When two countries trade, the resources or items in issue must be paid for, and this is done via fiat currency. For a long period of time, fiat currency was the only way for countries to pay for foreign exchange. Then cryptocurrency came along. The use of centralized money, however, comes with a disadvantage endemic to centralized systems: the potential of sanctions from powerful players.

42421593,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoi5t,1652119422,Dr. Doom’s Crypto Embrace? We’re All Just Figuring Things Out,"Nouriel “Dr. Doom” Roubini looks to be embracing crypto, at least in a roundabout way, after years of building a reputation as one of the most critical, skeptical, weary-eyed observers of the industry.  Bloomberg reported on Monday that the economist, who is known for his bearish views, is working with a Dubai-based financial firm, Atlas Capital, which is reportedly engaging Web 3 firm Mysten Labs to build the “United Sovereign Governance Gold Optimized Dollar,” or “USG.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  It goes without saying that this project is mostly still in “ideation,” and that the details will be worked out and are likely subject to change. But the general sketch is this: Roubini, arch crypto critic, will help develop a “more resilient dollar” backed by real assets, including U.S. Treasurys, gold and real estate investment trusts.  There’s more. The digital asset is meant to be inflation resistant and a way to bring a wider group of people under the ropes of high finance – perhaps, ultimately, if things play out, act as a global reserve currency.  We here at CoinDesk applaud financial innovation, risk-takers and those willing to put ideas into practice. We especially recommend those who are looking to fix the myriad problems of the post-industrial, ultra-financialized economy.  See also: If Money Is Speech, CBDCs Should Be Tools for Freedom | Opinion  And so, as a show of respect, we say go for it, see what happens, why not? If Roubini wants to tackle problems, rather than finding fault, more power to him.  Careful observers might note that the “United Sovereign Governance Gold Optimized Dollar” resembles another project that had ambitions of Global Reserve Status and to help underserved communities: Libra! Facebook’s Libra!  Libra, you may recall, was the first iteration of a Facebook-backed crypto project that wanted to “bank the unbanked.” It would have been a digital coin backed by a basket of fiat currencies, Treasurys and other financial instruments. (Mysten was founded by former Meta Platforms. – formerly Facebook – engineers.)  The project never launched, partly because Facebook burned its reputation to the ground selling our data and potentially destabilizing democracy. So regulators worldwide acted on our behalf to say that Facebook – with its billions of users and foothold within the internet – couldn’t be trusted with a radical new attempt for currency design.  Roubini’s project is similarly ambitious – creating an alternative safe haven asset to U.S. Treasurys that also has “payment features.” It might also offer yield, making it more attractive to hold, although in a blog post, Roubini notes that USG’s fluctuating value may limit its use as a form of payment.  Roubini et al in that blog cited a few risks to the greenback’s hegemony: inflation, dollar debasement, the rising influence of China and something called Triffin’s dilemma related to the U.S. debt load (or, “twin fiscal and current account deficits”).  Still, USG wouldn’t exactly compete with the dollar and could complement a central bank digital currency, Roubini suggested.  Indeed, the world is changing and the economy is getting … weirder. Crypto is both a source of this changing environment and also home to a number of people who want to fix what’s broken. Crypto is not an academy, but rather a source of a lot of ideas. And a lot of potential solutions.  The beauty of the industry isn’t that it pretends to have the answers, but that it is willing to experiment. Not all these will pan out, though if we’re open-minded, we might learn something.  For instance, this weekend, an incredibly popular and risky “algorithmic stablecoin” called UST lost its peg to the U.S. dollar after a number of investors sold and after significant quantities were withdrawn from decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity pools. That ""depegging"" could have doomed UST, which relies on the arbitrage opportunity with another crypto, luna, to maintain its peg to the U.S. dollar, especially because at least so far no algo stablecoin has worked.  See also: UST Stablecoin Falls Below Dollar Peg for Second Time  UST’s principle backer, a fellow named Do Kwon, also says he’s motivated by a sense of fixing what’s wrong within the financial system and expanding the range of financial options available to people. It’s a noble pursuit, perhaps. He could be lying or wrong. But, if Roubini is anything to go by, we’re all still figuring it out.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | LUNA,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/05/09/dr-dooms-crypto-embrace-were-all-just-figuring-things-out,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3ad3e25b6e4ae803bba50abd7afb817990105096-640x427.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42435424,z5xashhl2ItpefZwyLxr89,1652115094,"UST Stablecoin Loses Dollar Peg for Second Time in 48 Hours, LUNA Market Cap Falls Below UST's","TerraUSD (UST) has lost its dollar peg for the second time in three days, falling to as low as $0.65 on Monday, according to the most recent price estimates from CoinMarketCap.  As UST has ""depegged,"" the price of LUNA, its sister token, has dropped over 44% to $35 in the past 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap.  UST, a so-called algorithmic stablecoin, works with LUNA to maintain a price of $1 using a set of on-chain mint and burn mechanics. In theory, these mechanics work to ensure traders can always swap $1 worth of UST for $1 worth of Luna, which has a floating price and is meant to serve as a kind of shock absorber for UST's price.  Luna's price decline puts its market cap below that of UST's. That potentially throws the foundation of UST's entire stabilizing mechanism into jeopardy, because it means a Terra bank run could lead to some users no longer being able to redeem their $1 of UST for $1 of LUNA.  Read More: What is LUNA and UST? A Guide to the Terra Ecosystem  UST’s earlier loss of its $1 peg this weekend, which saw the token dip to $0.985 on Saturday before recovering to the $1 mark on Sunday, wasn't the first or the largest “depeg” event in Terra’s history, but it marked the first time the algorithmic stablecoin slipped below $1 since it embarked on a much-publicized bid to build out bitcoin and avalanche reserves.  Major stress  Today’s depeg comes after the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) announced Sunday night that $1.5 billion of its massive bitcoin reserves would be “loaned” out to professional market makers to proactively defend UST’s dollar peg.  Monday's events were ""the biggest stress test the system has ever faced,"" José Maria Macedo – a partner at Delphi Digital and an LFG council member who helps manage the group's reserves – told CoinDesk. But he added that the UST-LUNA market cap flip is not a cause for concern because of LFG's reserves.  Shortly after Macedo's call with CoinDesk, Terra appeared to empty out all of the funds (around $1.3 billion) from its confirmed bitcoin address.  A few minutes later, Do Kwon, the outspoken CEO of Terra's creators, Terraform Labs, tweeted, ""Deploying more capital - steady lads.""  Professional market makers are apparently using the BTC reserves to defend UST's dollar peg on protocols like Curve, which allows people to swap between UST and other currencies like the dollar-backed USDC and Tether stablecoins.  Currently, there is no concrete link between the LFG reserves and Terra's on-chain mint and burn mechanism. There are proposals to bake Terra's bitcoin reserves into its underlying smart contracts, but there's currently no way for users to directly redeem UST or LUNA for bitcoin.  Whether this will ever be possible has become even more unclear now that the reserves look to have been drained almost entirely.  On CoinDesk TV on Monday morning, Swan Bitcoin CEO Cory Klippsten called Terra a “confidence game” in response to the outsized influence of Terra’s founders and big-money backers in actively working to help the currency maintain its peg.

This came despite a plunge in prices for bitcoin (BTC) and most other cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin funds racked up $45 million in inflows, CoinShares reported Monday. Because of outflows from funds targeting other cryptocurrencies, there was a net $40.3 million in inflows overall across all digital-asset funds.  The week's inflows marked a sharp turn after four consecutive weeks of outflows.  James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, said the positive balance was likely due to “investors taking advantage of the substantive price weakness.” He questioned how durable the trend reversal might prove.  “Interestingly, we have not seen the same spike in investment-product trading activity, as we typically see historically during extreme price weakness periods,"" Butterfill said. ""It is too early to tell if this marks the end of the four-week run of negative sentiment.”  The price of bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, slid to $35,000 by Friday after opening the week at around $38,000. The price briefly spiked to $40,000 after the U.S. Federal Reserve hiked rates by 0.5 percentage point last week.  Most crypto funds trade on weekdays, when stock markets are open.  Bitcoin short funds, which profit off the BTC price falling, recorded their second-strongest inflows of the year, $4 million, reaching $45 million assets under management.  Funds focused on ether (ETH) extended their losing streak, seeing $12.5 million in outflows, bringing year-to-date outflows to $217 million.  Multi-asset funds recorded inflows of $1.7 million, totaling $150 million.  Solana's SOL was the only altcoin seeing substantial inflows into funds, at $1.9 million, bringing its year-to-date inflows to $107 million.  Fund flows were lopsided by geography, as North American investment products saw inflows of $66 million while European funds saw outflows totaling $26 million.

In a survey of the Caribbean nation's economic and financial policy, the IMF noted the sand dollar represents only 0.1% of currency in circulation.  The country’s central bank “should continue strengthening internal capacity – including on cybersecurity and the resilience of systems associated with the sand dollar,” said the IMF, adding that there are currently “limited avenues to use the sand dollar.”  Bahamas authorities plan to expand public information campaigns about the CBDC in response to the report, said Philip Jennings, the IMF executive director responsible for that country.  Alongside Nigeria and China, the Bahamas has been a pioneer in pushing forward a CBDC, seeing it as a good way of reaching people in the hundreds of far-flung islands that make up the archipelago. The country recently confirmed citizens could use it to pay their taxes.  Perhaps feeling its own power threatened by the likes of bitcoin (BTC), the IMF has been largely skeptical about he use of private crypto in countries such as El Salvador and Argentina.

42421183,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXd5FF,1652109485,Michael Wagner: Building a Virtual Nation-State in the Metaverse,"Several heavily armed security guards stand at the entrance to the Solana Hacker House in a relatively empty section of Miami’s Wynwood neighborhood one evening in early April, the same week as the big Bitcoin conference taking place in South Beach.  These aren’t your everyday security guards. With muscles rippling on top of muscles and bulletproof vests covered in ammunition, their intensity belies the very benign scene behind the metal detectors – essentially a big group of nerds discussing blockchain development in an open-air event space punctuated by Fun Dimension, a giant arcade.  But those nerds might be holding lots of crypto.  This article is part of Road to Consensus, a series highlighting speakers and the big ideas they will discuss at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more.  The nerd I’m here to meet is Michael Wagner, co-founder and CEO of Star Atlas, a massively multiplayer online (MMO) game his team has been building on the Solana blockchain. It made its debut in January.  It’s an extremely ambitious project and still in its earliest stages (about 160,000 people are in the Star Atlas channel on the Discord messaging app so far, Wagner says). Players can access the game’s first module including limited gameplay and NFT (non-fungible token) asset buying.  Star Atlas encompasses a sci-fi plot-line unfolding in the year 2620, with graphics fitting for a Triple-A (read: high-budget) game. Three warring factions compete for valuable resources on the discovered planet Iris, using the in-game currency Atlas to purchase ships and other virtual items to meet their goals and live their virtual lives.  The game’s meta-currency is Polis, which players can use to determine the game’s governance through layers of hierarchical decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). From local to regional to top level, they mimic something like the structure of federal, state and local governments.  “We think about what we're building at Star Atlas as almost like an independent nation-state,” Wagner says after finding me between two separate sets of security guards, one patrolling the Hacker House’s entrance and the other the VIP area (which we can’t enter even though Wagner has credentials, since I don’t and security isn’t taking any chances).  People will even be able to earn a living through Star Atlas' play-to-earn capabilities, à la Axie Infinity but with endless possibilities that the players can create themselves. If players can’t afford or earn enough Atlas to buy their own spaceship, someone else in the game may decide to become a sort of Uber driver in space, shuttling them from one planet to another in exchange for the game’s tokens, which they can ultimately convert to fiat if they want.  There’s energy and a vibe here that’s very supportive and conducive to building in crypto  “We're building a global country of sorts and a virtual economy for people to participate in this grandiose vision,” Wagner admits, “but there’s real potential there.”  Who is Wagner to assert such a grandiose vision? In red pants and a white Miami-themed Solana shirt covering broad shoulders, he introduces himself first as a “huge advocate for bitcoin” with a disarming smile as we take a seat at an umbrella-covered wooden table (surrounded by other umbrella-covered wooden tables on a sea of fake grass).  Wagner has only very recently relocated to Miami from another party city, Las Vegas – but he’s here to build his game.  “There’s energy and a vibe here that’s very supportive and conducive to building in crypto,” he says. The Solana Hacker House alone attracted somewhere between 1,000 and 5,000 people on the day we meet, he estimates.  Pablo Quiroga, Atlas' co-founder and chief revenue officer, moved to the city a few months prior, and Estefan Ramirez Vazquez, the company’s newly hired head of growth, lives in Miami now, too.  But the company is global, with nearly 200 employees spanning 26 countries, from New Zealand to central Africa.  “Discord is essentially our headquarters,” Wagner explains. Though it’s difficult to attract the limited number of talented, in-demand Rust engineers to any given blockchain company, Star Atlas hasn’t had much of a problem. Leadership gets emails daily, Wagner says, from qualified engineers asking to work with the team, and has so far hired 45, most of whom predominantly develop blockchain products.  ***  Wagner himself is not a software engineer. “Gaming and PC building was my way into crypto,” he says.  In fact, he and his high school friends in the 1990s were so into gaming and computers they formed a group around their shared passion called the LANarchists. (“We were all really nerdy … I’m actually proud of it,” he says, looking like he’s fully grown out of his nerdom and started regularly hitting the gym.)  About a decade post-high school, one of the guys from that group told Wagner about crypto and mining using graphics processing units.  “He had built this milk crate rig with three GPUs in it,” Wagner recalls. “And I was looking at that, like, this is definitely something I can do.”  At the time, Wagner was working in traditional finance, essentially managing portfolios. He immediately saw the parallels between the markets he was working in and the emerging markets in crypto. By 2015, he had left his “regular job” and switched to working in crypto full time, starting his first company in Nevada in 2016, called Tokes. From the name, it’s easy to tell that the company sat at the “intersection of crypto and cannabis,” Wagner describes – an especially tricky intersection at the time.  “It was a tough sell,” he says. Even though cannabis had become legal in Nevada, it remained illegal on the federal level, meaning retail companies couldn’t use the traditional banking system. Providing those companies with a crypto token seemed like a natural solution to the problem, but crypto was stigmatized back then, coming off its underground druggy associations with Silk Road, and cannabis sales licenses were limited in Nevada. No one wanted to risk losing their own licenses by accepting cryptocurrencies.  Wagner and his co-founders, Daniel and Jacob Floyd (now both at Star Atlas), opted for a different route. Instead of going to cannabis retailers, they went straight to the Nevada state legislature, meeting with dozens of policymakers to ultimately pass Assembly Bill 466https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/80th2019/Bill/6890/Overview.  “This introduced an optional, tokenized, closed loop financial ecosystem for cannabis,” Wagner says. “What we would effectively do is create an in-state, private stablecoin.”  Fatefully, that bill passed not long before COVID-19, and just when Tokes was picking up momentum, the team’s work was put on hold. Wagner and his team members started asking themselves, “What else is going on in crypto right now?” The answers were “DeFi (decentralized finance), NFTs and blockchain gaming,” Wagner says. “And we’re all gamers.”  Plus, as an active yield farmer in DeFi, Wagner saw the inherent gamification in borrowing and moving funds to find the optimal spread. He goes so far as to call DeFi “the first gaming product in crypto … It’s not running around with a sword and killing a monster, but there were some gameplay mechanics.”  Wagner credits Daniel Floyd, now Star Atlas' chief product officer, for much of the game’s concept. He’s largely responsible for the plot centered on the three fighting, interplanetary factions, the alien-esque Oni, the armored Uster, and the humanoid Mud. But their first company Tokes is still breathing – active but “somewhat dormant,” as Wagner puts it. They even plan to possibly incorporate it into Star Atlas.  “We are going to be bringing Tokes as a craft cannabis community into the metaverse,” Wagner says, by creating a product players can “use in the game.” When I ask if there’s an “IRL (in real life) component” to that, Wagner elaborates.  “There's a very real potential and high likelihood that people start consuming their digital purchases through 3D immersive environments instead of shopping on a 2D website. You're logged into your avatar, maybe you're playing a game, maybe you're hanging out with some friends, and while you're sitting there socializing, you're also going through your shopping list,” he says. “Then you pay with digital currency, and it gets delivered to your physical residence. There's nothing preventing that from happening.”  ***  Buying physical cannabis in a virtual store in Star Atlas is still ways away from becoming a reality. In a different section of the Hacker House, past empanada-hawking food trucks and among other “NFT Metaverse” exhibitors, the gaming company has a booth with several screens showing Star Atlas' high-quality animation – most of what the company has to publicly show for its work so far.  The ships look like vehicles out of “Star Wars,” or perhaps the video game Star Citizen, which inspired Daniel Floyd’s vision for the game. Quiroga is hanging by the screens, and he describes first meeting Wagner back in Nevada. While standing behind him on line in a coffee shop, Quiroga commented on his cycling keychain – they’re both cyclists and started riding together, and during one of those earlier rides, Wagner introduced Quiroga to blockchain.  Wagner seems to have sold the blockchain to Quiroga as easily as he sold the idea of Star Atlas to Solana’s co-founders (“I don't think it would be out of line for me to say that Star Atlas is one of the flagship projects being built on Solana,” Wagner says) and brought on crypto exchange FTX as the game’s on-boarding partner (Wagner first considered building the game on Solana after hearing FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried discuss it on a podcast).  Ultimately, the Star Atlas team went with Solana because they see it as a “highly scalable” network. That’s key, because Wagner said he believes “gaming will bring the next billion users into crypto.”  He also brings up the ability to create more complex systems in Solana, which offers low transaction costs along with limited lag time during gaming scenarios. “If you're running around and you shoot a bullet and it doesn't shoot and then you die, you're mad,” he says.  The game has to run smoothly – the point, after all, is to create a Triple-A game on a blockchain that will appeal to current gamers, crypto natives and play-to-earners in developing countries.  Plus, Wagner and his team want the game to be as immersive as possible – both a fun escape for players, but also truly another world they can live in, a place to buy cannabis and govern their communities and have a virtual job where they can make real money.  “All activities that are taking place online right now, they're going to be reproduced in some way in these immersive, three-dimensional digital worlds,” Wagner says.  That means the problems that exist in the physical world can easily translate to Star Atlas. For example, the plan is for assets in Star Atlas to cost anywhere from the fiat equivalent of $15 to massive, multi-purpose ships that could auction for up to $5 million or $10 million, Wagner speculates. Real-world wealth, in other words, will influence social stratification in the game – but he sees a Web 3 solution for that.  “This is where crypto and Web 3 is significantly powerful, because the idea of pooled capital is going to be very possible via smart contracts in a trustless fashion,” he explains.  Players could form collectives to buy expensive ships as a group, and wealthy ship owners can employ other players, paying them real money to run their $10 million ship in the metaverse. While Wagner admits none of this can solve social stratification, the game can “enable people to collaborate more freely.”  This is all a lot to digest – a metaverse that’s a totally fictional sci-fi game where people can get real jobs and, yes, even hire Web 3-inclined musicians to host real (but digital) concerts that people/avatars can attend if they hold the right digital tokens that they paid for with IRL fiat currency. They can form DAOs to buy ships or make political decisions within this fake reality that can potentially make or break their real-life fortunes.  These are the many possibilities Wagner rattles off as we sit in this snow globe of a Solana-themed pop-up in the middle of a desolate section of Miami heavily guarded by security, none of whom we can see from our seat on the fake grass. It all makes you think – is it a problem if people become too far removed from their physical environments, too immersed in a false reality to the point where the line between what’s real and what’s fabricated blurs beyond recognition?  For Wagner, that’s not a concern. “Creating a place for people to escape is probably beneficial,” he says. “If you talk to Elon Musk – and I would agree with this – there's a high probability that we live in a simulation anyway.”  Star Atlas might as well be the next iteration. “We're building something that we believe will live 100 years or more, if done right,” Wagner says. “It’s a step in the process of getting people into this new world.”",NEUTRAL,없음,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | SOL,Jessica Klein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/09/michael-wagner-building-a-virtual-nation-state-in-the-metaverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a51673507b3501714977b69e8ef0d3d0cba95287-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The arbiter of creditworthiness slapped Compound Treasury (a product of Compound Prime LLC) with a B- grade, meaning the USDC-powered yield platform ranks as ""speculative"" but ""currently has the capacity to meet financial commitments.""  ""The outlook is stable,"" S&P said of Compound Prime in a statement.  Despite the poor marks, Compound heralded the rating as DeFi first. It appears to be the first time an ""institutional DeFi"" product has been scored by one of the major credit rating agencies.  ""[This] signals tremendous progress in the crypto industry's maturity, as traditional institutions begin to judge the risks of digital asset powered financial offerings,"" Compound Treasury's general manager, Reid Cuming, wrote in a blog post.  Cuming described the rating to CoinDesk as a ""translation mechanism"" for institutions looking to dip their toes into DeFi.  ""What is really interesting and important about this is it really does show that DeFi can be measured, weighed and incorporated into more traditional financial risk methodologies, and additionally, also understood by traditional finance,"" Cuming said in an interview.

Accounts throw off 4% APR on deposits of the stablecoin USDC, are classified as securities and are offered only to accredited institutional customers, according to the product's website.  In its assessment, S&P said Treasury has yet to find its footing, ""with only 20 customers and $180 million invested at the end of April."" By comparison, Compound's primary DeFi lending platform currently boasts a total value locked (TVL) of over $5 billion in crypto assets.  Wrote S&P: ""Major rating weaknesses include, in our view, the company's very low capital base, regulatory risk associated with cryptocurrencies, considerable operational risk and complexity, convertibility risk between private stable coins and fiat currency, and the potential hurdles to generate a 4% return.""",NEUTRAL,USDC,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | USDC,"Zack Seward, Sam Kessler",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/09/compounds-enterprise-arm-receives-sp-credit-rating-in-defi-first,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6240cc94372559c1cd039deb6cfcae2c66b75de5-6240x4160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At this time, the lucky owners of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Dash, and other cryptocurrencies must mention the profits made on their declaration.

As with any other property transaction, the IRS taxes cryptocurrency transactions by following the laws of the United States. When you sell or trade bitcoin and realize a profit, you must pay taxes on that profit. For example, if you buy $1,000 worth of cryptocurrency and sell it for $1,500, you would have to declare and pay taxes on the $500 profit. Conversely, you may claim a loss on your taxes if you sell cryptocurrencies and realize a loss. Buying crypto is not taxable. It is tax-free to invest in and hold cryptocurrencies, even if their value rises. Revenue Service has started making efforts to ensure that crypto investors fulfill their income tax obligations. However, if a taxpayer has any kind of transaction with a virtual currency during the calendar year, they will need to answer some questions. More than 200 transactions and more than $20,000 in trading in a calendar year need the filing of a 1099-K by cryptocurrency exchanges. How can you determine if you owe cryptocurrency taxes?

42435439,z5xashhl2ItpefZwyLxrUP,1652105658,First Mover Americas: Institutions Look to Be Selling BTC in Falling Market,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Macro headwinds continue to push bitcoin lower. A popular indicator suggests institutions are selling into a falling market. Two charts offer hope to battered bitcoin bulls.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Steven McClurg, chief investment officer and co-founder, Valkyrie  Cory Klippsten, CEO, Swan Bitcoin  Maxim Galash, CEO, Coinchange  Market Moves  It’s a new week but the same old story in financial markets. The U.S. dollar is again trading higher as macro headwinds weigh over stocks, bonds and cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin (BTC), the top cryptocurrency by market value, traded at a 3 1/2-month low of $33,080 at press time, representing a 3% drop on the day, according to CoinDesk data.  ""Investors are clearly concerned about the aggressive monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, as they will also begin Quantitative Tightening (removal of liquidity from the market) in June,"" Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, said in an email.  Institutional selling  A popular indicator suggests institutions are selling into a falling market.  The ""Coinbase premium index,"" an indicator showing the spread between Coinbase's BTC/U.S. dollar (USD) pair and Binance's BTC/USDT pair involving the tether stablecoin, recently turned negative and fell to a 12-month low, according to data tracked by South Korea-based Cryptoquant.  ""This [negative Coinbase premium] is telling as a greater percentage of institutions use Coinbase compared to retail, whereas the opposite is the case for Binance. Therefore, the price mismatch mentioned suggests institutions are not currently as interested as retail,"" Sotiriou said. ""This will be good to keep an eye on going forward and if/when this reverses it could coincide with some relief in the market or a reversal.""  CryptoQuant said in a quicktake blog, ""Usually, there is a Coinbase premium. This means that the bitcoin price on Coinbase is higher than on Binance. This was/is very important, because American institutions and HNW (High Net Worth) were trading mostly on Coinbase. However... in the latest few days it's negative. This indicates heavy selling on Coinbase Pro!""  Terra jitters  Programmable blockchain Terra's UST, the world's biggest decentralized stablecoin, lost its 1:1 dollar peg over the weekend after multi-million dollar UST sales on Curve and Binance and a series of significant withdrawals from Anchor Protocol, a lending market offering high yields to UST depositors.  The depegging perhaps added to the downward pressure on bitcoin and the wider crypto market. ""People become afraid that the Luna Foundation Guard [LFG] would have to sell its BTC to support the UST peg, so BTC sells off,"" Ilan Solot, a partner at the Tagus Capital Multi-Strategy Fund, said in an email.  ""Remember that Terra foundation is the second-largest corporate holder of BTC, between MicroStrategy and Tesla,"" Solot added.  The stablecoin was 0.5% off its peg at the time of writing. Terra's founder Do Kwon tweeted early Monday that the LFG agreed to deploy $1.5 billion in capital to defend the peg while assuring the market that the foundation was not trying to abandon its bitcoin position.  Some 'hopium'  Amid the gloom and doom, two charts could offer some ""hopium"" – a crypto slang for hope – to the battered bitcoin bulls.  The first is bitcoin's implied volatility (IV) – options traders' expectations for price turbulence over a specific period. The one-week implied volatility has risen above the six-week gauge, a sign of peak fear.  A similar IV structure has marked temporary/interim price bottoms in the past.  Secondly, the dollar index's (DXY) technical chart shows the 50-week moving average is on track to move above the 200-week MA, confirming the so-called bullish crossover (Editor's note: The newsletter mistakenly said ""monthly"" moving averages).  While the golden cross is a bullish indicator, as per technical analysis theory, it is a lagging indicator in reality and often traps traders on the wrong side of the market. In other words, the DXY could be closing on an interim top. The dollar weakness is considered positive for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

So what are investors getting out of it? DeFi&apos;s goal is to empower investors to &apos;become the bank.&apos; They do this by giving them chances to lend money to each other and earn better returns. As an added convenience, digital wallets allow investors to send and receive money instantly from different locations across the globe. Moreover, they carry this out without having to pay for high fees associated with conventional banking. We&apos;ll go over how Decentralized Finance works, what it can do for people, and how it threatens conventional banking. How DeFi works Financial services like loans, interest on deposits, and payments are all offered by DeFi — but these services will be provided via decentralized technology. DeFi, on the other hand, influences the industry. As a result of this, the financial products and services offered by DeFi can be delivered using the new infrastructure. To this, it uses a variety of techniques, including blockchain technology and smart contracts. For example, it is possible to record and trace back all transactions on a specific financial platform to a single source using blockchain technology.

Bitcoin lost the critical support level of $40,000 last week and did not hold above subsequent support levels at $38,000 and $35,800. It could drop to as low as $31,500 if current levels fail to hold.  Crypto majors followed bitcoin’s drop: Ether (ETH) lost 8.7% in the past 24 hours, while Cardano’s ADA (ADA) and Solana’s SOL (SOL) dipped as much as 10%. Memecoin shiba inu (SHIB) took an even bigger hit with a 13% fall.  Liquidations on crypto-tracked futures exceed $411 million in the past 24 hours, data shows. Of that, some $140 million arose from bitcoin futures, and $121 million came from ether futures.  Bitcoin’s initial weekend declines came alongside TerraUSD (UST) losing its peg to the dollar. The fall added steam on Sunday evening as Asian equity markets and U.S. stock index futures opened sharply lower, with fears continuing to grow about the monetary response to surging inflation. Japan’s Nikkei ended the day 2.5% lower, Europe's Stoxx 600 is down 2% at midday, and Nasdaq futures are down 1.5%.  The U.S. dollar, meanwhile, continues to benefit from panicky markets, with the Australian dollar and Indian rupee notable losers today.  Analysts previously warned about a drop in bitcoin prices if the broader economic outlook continued to sour. “Professional money managers aren't loading up on high-risk growth assets currently,” said Kurt Grumelart, a trader at crypto fund Zerocap, in a Telegram message last week. “You can't look past current headwinds and high correlation to traditional markets,” he added at the time, warning about bitcoin’s current price correlation with U.S. markets.",NEGATIVE,ADA | BTC | SHIB,ADA | BTC | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/09/bitcoin-tumbles-to-lowest-since-july-2021-as-market-panic-grows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/786b23f108963f9aafee38e8d87debdfdc0baa49-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42435447,z5xashhl2ItpefZwyLxv6T,1652097600,Coinbase Faces Q1 Earnings Challenge as Crypto Markets Weaken,"Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global, Inc. (COIN) will continue to face headwinds as the company is set to report first quarter earnings on Tuesday after the market close.  Coinbase already warned investors during its fourth quarter earnings report that it's expecting lower trading volumes and monthly transacting users given a drop in crypto asset volatility and macroeconomic factors. As a result, Wall Street analysts have mostly reduced their earnings and volume estimates heading into Tuesday’s release.  According to FactSet, the consensus analyst estimate for Coinbase’s first quarter is for $1.5 billion in revenues and an adjusted earnings loss of one cent per share.  “Despite the downturn in crypto activity, [the first quarter] was marked by few sudden price swings which can lead to higher volumes on increased volatility,” John Todaro, an equity research analyst with investment bank Needham & Co., said in a note to clients. “The period was instead marked by a steady, continuing decline with periods of range-bound markets leading to relatively muted volumes.”  Todaro is expecting overall trading volumes of $322 billion in the first quarter, down from his previous estimate of $355 billion. He maintained a buy recommendation on the stock.  The start of the second quarter also hasn’t inspired analysts, and some anticipate more headwinds from Coinbase’s outlook.  “Average daily trading volumes on COIN have averaged $2.3 billion thus far in 2Q, approximately 30% below 1Q levels,” Dan Dolev, an equity research analyst at Mizuho told clients in a note earlier this week. “On a full-quarter basis, this would imply about $210-215 billion of volumes for 2Q.”  Dolev says consensus revenue expectations for Q2 are “too optimistic,” and maintains a neutral rating on Coinbase’s shares.  NFT launch  Coinbase’s non-fungible token (NFT) segment will garner some attention as investors will get a look at its early days and engagement with users. The company recently launched its beta version, which showed low usage stats.  Still, some remain upbeat that Coinbase’s NFT segment will help make the company a one-stop shop for mainstream crypto adoption.  “The NFT move also underscores our ongoing view that perhaps the ‘most boring’ part of the COIN investment case at this point is the spot price of bitcoin and that the future for this innovative company is materially broader and wider than just the leading digital asset and its associated trading volumes,” Canaccord Genuity analyst Joe Vafi told clients in a note near the end of April.

So, should you wait for a bullish recovery, or is it the time to sell? Key technical points: The BTC price cracks under $35000. The EMAs maintain a bearish alignment. The 24-hour trading volume of Bitcoin is $39.97 Billion, indicating a 16.27% rise. Past Performance of BTC BTC prices showcase a bullish failure to sustain above the $45000 resulting in the ongoing correction phase and the $35000 breakout. The downtrend destroys 30% of the market value of Bitcoin in the last month and breaks under all the crucial daily EMAs. Source-Tradingview BTC Technical Analysis BTC prices failed to create a single bullish candle in the last six days, reflecting the degree of selling pressure driving the bearish trend. Therefore, traders can find selling opportunities shortly with closing below the $33000. The EMAs maintain a bearish alignment with the market value below the 200 EMA with a significant bearish spread between the EMAs. The RSI slope is at the oversold line when it fails to cross over the 14-day average line as well as the mid-point line. Thus, if the declining RSI value continues a downtrend within the 14-day SMA and enters the oversold zone, it will signal a selling spot.

The loss compares to the $858.2 million gain recorded in the equivalent quarter a year ago.  Galaxy Digital attributed the loss to unrealized losses on digital assets and on investments in its trading and investments businesses in an announcement on Monday.  The firm's asset management business, Galaxy Digital Asset Management (GDAM), recorded assets under management of $2.7 billion, consisting of $2 billion in GDAM's Galaxy Fund Management products and $735 million in the Galaxy Interactive fund. This is more than double the figure of $1.27 billion recorded a year ago, but a 5% decrease compared to Q4 2021.  CEO Michael Novogratz highlighted weakness across crypto and equity markets during Galaxy's earnings call Monday, though said he isn't ""panicked by any stretch."" He added that his recent investor meetings point to growing adoption, and noted that ""crypto as a tech play"" is gaining momentum.  Volatility will continue, according to Novogratz, although he said he expects bitcoin to hold around the $30,000 level and ether to stick around the $2,000 level.  BTIG equity research analyst Mark Palmer lowered his price target on Monday afternoon on Galaxy's stock to $28.45 to $36.91 per share, citing the ""more challenging market conditions"" across the sector. Though Palmer says shares are ""very inexpensive in light of the strength"" of Galaxy's platform. He maintained a buy recommendation.  GLXY's Toronto-listed shares were trading down about 26% to $9.97 on Monday.  UPDATE (May 9, 20:01 UTC): Updates with analyst comment.

Data from tracking service DeFi Llama shows DeFi protocols hold a collective $177.6 billion as on Monday, a 29% slump from December highs of $252 billion. Some $27 billion in locked value was lost over this weekend alone, the data shows.  Stablecoin swap platform Curve, the largest DeFi protocol by total value locked (TVL), saw a nearly 10% drop in the past week. Staking service Lido saw a 13% drop, while Terra’s Anchor took a 21% cut as the TerraUSD (UST) token temporarily lost its peg to the U.S. dollar over the weekend.  Some protocols have taken big hits in the past month. DeFi aggregator Instadapp saw a 43% drop in TVL, lending protocol Aave lost 22%, while cross-chain liquidity tool Stargate lost as much as 60% of its TVL.  A part of the drop can be attributed to the falling prices of the underlying tokens stored, some analysts explained.  “The decline in DeFi TVL we’re currently seeing is caused mainly by the overall market downtrend – on the one hand, a lot of assets locked in DeFi protocols are highly volatile and their value decreased with the market dip,” said Kate Kurbanova, co-founder of risk management platform Apostro, in a Telegram message.  “On the other hand, we should count on the fear which usually comes with the downtrend and people exiting their positions (volatile) into stablecoins or fiat – which also drives value away,” Kurbanova added.  The fall in TVL comes as April saw falling revenues on DeFi platforms compared to March. These revenues are earned each time a user trades, lends or conducts other activity with the protocol taking a small cut of volumes as fees.  Financial services platform SushiSwap saw a 29% drop in revenues, while those on DeFi exchange Balancer fell as much as 66%, as reported. Curve (CRV) and Uniswap (UNI) were the only DeFi projects to post revenue gains. Curve earned 51% more in April than it did in March, while Uniswap made 13% more.  Tokens of the broader DeFi sector lost 34% on average – becoming the worse-performing crypto sector. The memecoin sector, in comparison, lost just 16%, proving to be a better bet for investors who chose to punt on memes instead of sophisticated technologies.",NEGATIVE,UNI,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | UNI,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/05/09/defi-locked-value-falls-to-yearly-low-27b-lost-over-the-weekend,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9a5a0720787d057f0afc32245c52f932f7aca6c5-4000x3000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Their aim is to let all Binancians know that they will be supporting the CKB upgrade and hardfork scheduled on 10th May. Binance Plans to Support the CKB Upgrade and Hardfork The CKB upgrade and hardfork would occur around 10th May 2022, 01:00 UTC, during the Nervos Network transaction level of 5,414. Once the upgrade and hardfork process commences, both withdrawals and deposits of CKB will no longer be allowed. Binance will take care of all the technical details for anyone with CKB in their Binance profiles. There wouldn&apos;t be any new tokens issued due to the CKB hard fork and upgrade. Last month, Jordan Mack said that Nervos Network would go through a hard fork to add new functionality to the network. There aren&apos;t any parties who oppose the modifications in this hard fork. On 10th May, there will be a total upgrade to the entire network. It&apos;s not just the hard fork itself that&apos;s being updated, but many other libraries and protocols. While the network is being upgraded and a hard fork is taking place, there will be no impact on CKB trading. The Nervos Network (CKB) would be upgraded and split in two at a block peak of 5,414.

His analysis of the Bitcoin market was rather brief yet detailed, drawing a lot of attention from crypto analysts. Anthony Scaramucci&apos;s Bitcoin Prediction According to Anthony Scaramucci, there is no shock in seeing BTC for sale for those who have examined the commodity and how it has grown and been adopted. BTC will be worth $18K in a fall similar to the last one. When it comes to long-term economic trends, Bitcoin will be a $15T asset and an important component of the future. It will serve as a currency, a reserve currency, and a method to keep central managers more responsible than at any point since the 1987 stock market disaster.

Starting with the market forces that demand individuals move towards an incorruptible structure. It could be 18,000 or 100,000 people.

Will the downtrend crack under $0.00001750? Key technical points: The SHIB price breaks below $0.00001850. The 100 and 200-day EMAs prepare a bearish crossover. The 24-hour trading volume of Shiba Inu is $615 Million, indicating a 15% rise. Past Performance of SHIB SHIB prices showcase a descending trendline breakout after buyers failed miserably to constrain the selling pressure and defend the $0.00001850 mark. The downtrend cracks under all the crucial EMAs and forms six consecutive bearish candles accounting for a 20% fall. Source-Tradingview SHIB Technical Analysis The downfall in SHIB prices continues after retesting the broken trendline to break under the psychological mark of $0.00001850 and accounts for a 35% decrease last month. Moreover, the intraday trading volume shows a positive trend since last week reflecting a rise in selling pressure. The EMAs will shortly achieve a bearish alignment with the 100 and 200 EMA providing a bearish crossover. However, the lack of bearish spread does reflect low but considerable bullish takeover possibilities.

From the achievements of sellers can be identified a new test of the lower trend line of the falling wedge. Throughout the fall wave from March 2021, trading volumes have been consistently low, giving rise to speculation about a new wave of global growth. However, reality does not yet signal the beginning of the formation of such positive thoughts. Moreover, given the ease of the BTC price fall, the probability of the THETA price fall outside the correction wedge is quite high. https://www.tradingview.com/x/PGbo7JIn/ Notice how the weekly candle of 2 May closed. The test of the lower trend line of the wedge did not affect buyers. No resistance, no rebound, no fight. This behavior of buyers maximized the probability of failure of the THETA price to $1.45. This mark kept the trend of buyers in January 2021 and made it possible to set a new historical high of $15.88. The $1.45 mark is the first mark from which you can place limit orders to buy and trade medium-term price rebounds at 60-80% of the price. And this is in the case of a continued global correction. In the case of a reversal - the mark of $1.45 may be the last achievement of sellers.

Starting in May 2021, buyers were allowed to form a falling wedge on the DASHUSDT weekly chart. During the year, sellers managed to lower the DASH price by 80%. However, this contrast is better if you imagine that in May 2021 you bought DASH for $400 and now the coin is worth $80. So far $80. Looking at the rhetoric of Bitcoin price, the probability of a continued decline in the entire crypto market is high. And the DASH cryptocurrency is not yet behaving as a favourite revolutionary who is able to offer the cryptocurrency market some alternative. Sellers managed to break the $87 range in the weekly timeframe. It is a local range that is not of strategic importance, but could be a good starting point for buyers to build a local growth wave with a target of $155. https://www.tradingview.com/x/znSah6c2/ However, the trading week on 2 May showed complete weakness of buyers. Sellers in early May without the use of force (increased volumes) managed to easily push the price below $87. So far, the DASH price is below this mark. Our main scenario - the DASH continues to fall to $70. At this point, the lower trend line of the falling wedge and the important liquid zone intersect. It was after fixing above the $70 liquidity zone in November 2020 that buyers began their final growth wave with the final target of $478.

42420806,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYcGr,1652079600,"How Big Is Crypto Crime, Really?","The European Union is in late-stage talks over how to implement new rules intended to curb dodgy behavior that uses virtual assets – but estimates of the share of crypto payments linked to financial crime vary wildly from 0.15% to a whopping 46% of transaction volumes.  There’s clearly a lot of illicit activity in the crypto world – of which some, like scams or hacks, are harmful to honest crypto users, while others might seem like a way of circumventing rules that were unfair in the first place, like government-imposed capital controls.  People in the crypto industry like to quote the figures on the lower end of the range, and on Friday, Binance’s CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao tweeted statistics to argue that crypto is safer than fiat.  But attempting to get a handle on the exact scale of unlawful virtual asset activity isn’t easy. It usually relies on identifying crypto addresses that appear suspect and totting up their trade volume – but illicit users generally prefer to hide in the shadows.  The result you get depends on how much certainty you want to have about who the illicit actors are online. When branding a wallet address as suspect, you might want to have a smoking gun that constitutes absolute proof, or be happy to accept something more probabilistic and speculative.  For regulators, judges and law enforcement, understanding the problem could prove crucial to determining whether new laws to force crypto users to identify themselves are needed or even lawful.  Yet there’s surprisingly little consensus on how big crypto crime is. Almost certainly, in dollar terms, it’s dwarfed by the real-life version. According to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, money laundering through conventional finance is worth as much as $2 trillion, comparable to the total value of all the world’s crypto markets combined.  But regulators are worried not just about the overall volumes, but what they represent as a share of the crypto sector. They’ve noted how fast virtual assets are gaining popularity, and are thinking about what the scale of the problem might be in future, not just today.  In a recent speech that criticized the industry as akin to a lawless Wild West, the European Central Bank’s Fabio Panetta cited a wide range of figures for illicit crypto activity, ranging from under 1% to as much as half of all virtual transactions.  Read more: ECB's Panetta Blasts Crypto as 'Ponzi Scheme' Fueled by Greed  One reason for variation in figures is whether you look at, say, drug purchases as a share of crypto payments or compared to the overall market. People who acquire bitcoin (BTC) just to ""HODL"" aren’t doing anything wrong – but that means a greater proportion of those using it to buy something are likely to be engaging in illicit activity.  Which wallet?  But beyond the question of exactly what you’re counting, there’s also a question of how you’re counting these transactions – and that all depends on how you determine who the bad actors are.  Industry figures and academics such as CZ, or Georgetown Law’s Chris Brummer, often quote figures from blockchain specialists Chainalysis – which said in January that transactions involving illicit addresses represented just 0.15% of cryptocurrency transaction volumes last year.  But that approach leaves plenty of crimes unaccounted for, CoinDesk was told by Sean Foley, an associate professor of applied finance at Macquarie University in Australia.  Foley’s own paper, evocatively titled “Sex, Drugs, and Bitcoin,” was peer-reviewed and published in the Review of Financial Studies in 2019. It concluded that one-quarter of bitcoin users are involved in illegal activity, and that the $76 billion in illicit payments involving bitcoin represented 46% of the currency’s total transactions.  That’s a much higher estimate than others on the market – but Foley defended his methods in an interview with CoinDesk.  Chainalysis “are not necessarily very transparent in their approach,” he said. “They don't really accurately document how they arrive at their numbers.”  “If Chainalysis only looked at Ross Ulbricht’s wallet that was seized by the FBI, but I look at all of his conduct through time. ... I'm going to find a lot more,” he said, referring to the founder of the Silk Road marketplace who was sentenced to jail in 2015.  Rather than just looking at addresses known to be suspect, Foley looked at each users’ networks and behaviors, using statistical techniques that are also deployed in fields like medicine and nuclear safety.  While, say, using a mixer to stay anonymous isn’t a smoking gun proving bad behavior, he says that taken together, different indicators can give you a good view about whether someone is up to no good.  “If you look dodgy because you were predominantly interacting with dodgy people, and you look dodgy because you were using a lot of tumbling services, and there was a lot of activity when darknet marketplaces got seized … this gives us the ability to say with a much higher degree of confidence that these are likely illicit actors,” he said.  Too far?  Others warn Foley might have gone too far, unfairly tainting innocent crypto users by association.  “You have to be really careful with crime data and the associations that you make between wallets,” Kim Grauer, Chainalysis’ head of research, told CoinDesk. Chainalysis says that illicit wallets received $14 billion in 2021, a figure much lower than Foley’s.  “A lot of times people will just see money transacting between a crime wallet and another wallet and they'll say, ‘hey, those must be connected,’” she said – citing examples such as when a single service managed millions of different addresses.  The “quirky” nature of blockchain means that “if you are not a crime investigator with blockchain experience, I would be a little bit skeptical of some of the definitive associations,” she said.  Chainalysis’ own data, in contrast to Foley’s, “is not extrapolated, it's not statistically determined,” she said. “This is the real amount of transactions that are identified as illicit from a data set that's the most powerful data set on cryptocurrency in the world.”  The Chainalysis figure still isn’t all encompassing, she acknowledged. It doesn’t include real-life crimes like street drug deals that then get laundered via bitcoin, nor gray areas like wash trading – the fake sales intended to push up market prices that appear to be becoming more common in the market for non-fungible tokens.  Scams can often only be identified after the rug is pulled, meaning the data for a given year can lag behind and needs to be updated. But, she said that an approach based on “hundreds of hundreds” of investigators sleuthing darknet forums looking for crime is “definitely, definitely fair.”  Read more: Europe's Lawmakers Set to Advance Discussion of Controversial Crypto AML Rules  Too old?  A further wrinkle is how rapidly data ages in such a fast moving market. The data Foley used dates back to 2017 – a lifetime ago, in the crypto world – but, if anything, he thinks the problem has only increased since then.  He acknowledges illicit bitcoin volumes have probably fallen over time – but only because wrongdoers turned to less ostentatious alternatives, such as ZCash, Monero and Dash.  “There's a lot of privacy technology that has been developed since the publication of our paper,” he said, and he believes that overall the criminal use of crypto “is not going down.”  “There's still a ton of online marketplaces for darknet products, so I don't think that's gone away,” he said – and also cited the rise in industrial-scale ransomware like the $5 million 2021 hack of Colonial Pipeline.  Regulators unconvinced  The people who really need to be convinced are, of course, the Financial Action Task Force, the international body responsible for developing money laundering norms for conventional finance and the crypto sector – including the controversial travel rule that the EU is now trying to implement.  In a report published in July 2021, FATF noticed significant variations in estimates of illicit crypto trades both over time and among different analysts, such as Chainalysis, Elliptic and Merkle Science – which could be, Grauer said, because they look at a different universe of transactions or currencies.  Whatever the reason, FATF believes that the analysts’ estimates of the percentage of transactions that are unlawful, which range from 0.1% to 15.4%, are all too low.  “The data provided only relates to identified illicit transactions which the companies are able to identify, based on lists of known or suspected illicit addresses,” the FATF report said. Figures from the likes of Chainalysis should be “treated as the likely minimum,” it concluded.  Grauer also seems to concede that point – saying that her favored figure “is a floor for the amount of illicit activity.”  “We wouldn't know how many [illicit actors] were missing,” she said. “You don't know what you don't know … if we knew about it, we would put it in our system.”  In the end, Foley and Grauer may have come up with different results because they have different aims. In the former case, it’s seeking to estimate the overall volumes linked to crime, and in the latter, identifying individual users who might be worth pursuing – something that requires a much higher burden of proof.  Methods like Foley’s are “certainly extremely useful,” Grauer said, but she warned that “results should not be relied on when it comes to identifying illicit wallets.”  “People use our data set to run full investigations, including putting people in jail,” she said – so she won’t blacklist someone lightly.  This matters for live policy. In March, the European Parliament voted to introduce new checks on the identities of those making even the smallest crypto payments – including, most controversially, when transactions are made with unhosted wallets that aren’t managed by a regulated exchange.  The idea – whose details still need to be finalized with national governments – is that law enforcement would then be able to more easily track crypto transactions that could be used to fund serious crimes, such as terrorism or child pornography. But the move met with a slew of opposition from industry players such as Coinbase (COIN), who said the bill could stifle innovation and harm privacy.  Laws that invade privacy more than they need to could get struck down, legal experts, such as Amsterdam University’s Thibaut Schrepel, told CoinDesk. That message seems to have gotten through to officials, such as the European Commission’s Gabriel Hugonnot, who has warned lawmakers that they would need to justify attempts to treat crypto differently from other kinds of financial transfers.  In considering whether the law is really needed, policymakers – and, eventually, judges – could be swayed by figures on the overall scale of the crypto crime problem, and by other features of crypto tech like the transparency of the network.  However imprecise the figures are, the kind of analysis possible on the blockchain is still much better than offline financial-crime stats, Grauer reckons.  “There is no equivalent number in the fiat world, because doing this type of research is just not possible,” she said. “Using U.S. dollars, how many drug dealers are there in the world? There's never a number you're going to get.”  But, ultimately, good policies come from good data – and it may be in short supply.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/09/how-big-is-crypto-crime-really,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/777408ed5fdb4b9253bd64dec7d463944f013e6d-3791x3078.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Crude oil prices were down early in the COVID-19 pandemic; nevertheless, the price has now topped $100 per barrel. Moreover, the worldwide benchmark, Brent crude oil, is currently trading above $111 per barrel. There has been a considerable rise in gas prices worldwide because of the rise in oil prices. If prices continue to rise, as many economists predict, it would stifle economic development, induce decreased consumption, and, in some situations, spark political instability. The increasing gasoline costs have already sparked fatal riots in nations such as Kazakhstan, Iran, and Zimbabwe. And, the significant factors for this have been the rebound in fuel consumption since the height of the coronavirus outbreak and supply difficulties in the aftermath of Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine. Even analysts at JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co and Bank of America have predicted that the Russian disruption will send oil prices up to $185 per barrel. Reasons for Rising Fuel Prices Oil has had a history of more significant fluctuations in price than any other asset. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, is the primary driver of oil price changes. Second is the supply and demand rules.
