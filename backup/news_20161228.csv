42399519,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjcGF,1482969320,"Will We See a $1,000 Bitcoin in 2016? Analysts Suggest Yes","As 2016 draws to a close, bitcoin prices continue to show strong, upward movement.  Depending on the media outlet you prefer, bitcoin is either ""storming"", ""surging"" or ""creeping"" its way back up to $1,000. In the past month alone, bitcoin has surged more than 33%, rising from $732 on 29th November to an annual high of $977.35.  At press time, bitcoin was up nearly 5% for the day's trading, capping off a seven-day period in which it saw 20% gains.  Should bitcoin prices breach $1,000 (the first time since January 2014), the digital currency could benefit from a handful of new tailwinds. The simple act of rising above $1,000, analysts say, is likely to generate greater visibility and therefore a flow of new money into bitcoin.  Surpassing $1,000 could also make this price a new support level.  Should bitcoin fall back after surpassing this point, the decline could motivate market participants to step in and buy the currency, thereby setting a price floor at $1,000.  Coming soon  But bitcoin prices will reach $1,000 soon enough, according to cryptocurrency hedge fund manager Tim Enneking, who told CoinDesk he expects the digital currency will start out 2017 at this price.  Enneking emphasized the importance of a ""Santa Claus Rally"" in 2016, meaning bitcoin's gains before and after Christmas.  Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of exchange firm BitMEX, provided an almost identical prediction  ""I am calling for $1,000 to be breached by the 31st of December 2016. The price corrected to $860 and was back above $900 in one day. That is a very healthy pullback,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""We will make a run for $1,000 before year end.""  In an opinion piece issued yesterday, investor Vinny Lingham suggested the same, stopping short of any year-end price predictions but issuing a rosy 2017 projection.  ""I expect to be within the $3,000 range by the end of next year, as I have previously forecast,"" he wrote.  Caution noted  Still, not everyone was convinced they could make a call.  Cryptocurrency fund trader Jacob Eliosoff emphasized that he believes the bitcoin and ether markets are likely to correlate through the year's end. While he acknowledged bitcoin is likely to pass $1,000, he didn't rule out that another cryptocurrency could attract attention through stronger gains.  In particular, he suggested a strong rise in long struggling ether prices, as an example, may be enough to move the market's attention elsewhere.  Further, he emphasized that ""no one should bet too much on timed predictions"" when it comes to cryptocurrencies.

42399499,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjcCJ,1482952020,IRS Asks Court to Reject Protest Filing From Coinbase Customer,"The IRS has asked a district court in California to dismiss a filing by a Coinbase customer that might prevent it from gaining access to the company's user data.  Filed in the US District Court of Northern California (which oversees the city of San Francisco where Coinbase is headquartered), the new documents request the filing be dismissed on the grounds that the request was only for unidentified users of Coinbase.  In the process of filing his documents to prevent the search, so goes the IRS argument, lawyer Jeffrey K Berns of the Berns Weiss law firm had revealed himself as a user, and as a result, was no longer of interest to their query.  The IRS now requests that its earlier motion be allowed to proceed.  Notably, in Berns' original filing earlier this month, he had requested that the IRS motion be refused on the grounds that the so-called ""John Doe"" summons (for information pertaining to anyone in a particular group of potential tax violators) would constitute an ""abuse of process.""  Yet by 30th November, US District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley had approved the request, paving the way for the IRS to force Coinbase to hand over information about its users.  In addition to concerns that the request for the Coinbase user information was ""overbroad"", Berns expressed concerns that handing over user information could make users vulnerable to attack.  Developing case  All told, the filing represents the latest in an escalation of legal filings that have occured since it was revealed in November that the IRS would seek to target cryptocurrency users for potential tax violations.  The action followed a recommendation from the agency's inspector general earlier that month in which it found the IRS had done little to police cryptocurrency tax infringements since ruling on its classification in 2013.  When reached for comment by CoinDesk earlier this month Coinbase said it looks ""forward to engaging the IRS,"" adding that it will keep its customers updated on developments.

42399510,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjcLA,1482943269,The Price of Bitcoin is Up $150 Over the Last Week,"The price of bitcoin keeps on climbing.  At press time, the price of bitcoin was roughly $950 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, a figure that was up $20 from the day's opening price and just $70 shy of a three-year high for the digital currency. (The price hit a high of $1,023.31 on 6th January, 2014).  However, this total was notably $150 above the opening price observed one week ago on 21st December, when tokens running on the bitcoin blockchain traded for an average of $799.23 across global exchanges.  The 20% increase over just a seven-day span has so far drawn a number of plausible theories, including that bitcoin is improving on economic conditions in countries such as India and Venezuela and decisions by the US Federal Reserve.  Data reveals that the increase is the largest price swing observed since late July, when the price of bitcoin declined from highs in the $660s to the mid-$500s following a hack on one of the network's most notable exchanges.  Yet, while notable for 2016, the rapid increase is by no means unique to the digital currency.  In late 2013, for instance, bitcoin rose nearly $500 to more than $1,100 from 23rd November to 30th November, before falling below $700 just days later.

42399498,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjc9M,1482937222,Bitcoin in 2017: A Currency Devaluation Hedge for Emerging Markets,"Vinny Lingham is the CEO of identity startup Civic, and the former founder of mobile gift card platform Gyft.  In this opinion piece, Lingham gives an overview of bitcoin's recent positive performance, predicting a $1,000 bitcoin before the year's end, and even a $3,000 bitcoin by 2018.  Since writing ""Bitcoin Awakening"" in April, bitcoin has moved from trading in the $400-dollar range to the verge of $1,000.  This is the first time this has happened since 2013, as I had forecast in that blog post. But to be even clearer, I said that it would hit $15bn market cap this year, which I'm pleased to report officially happened today when the price breached $934.  But before I break down my thoughts for 2017, I wanted to point out a couple of things.  In total, the price of bitcoin spent less than 48 hours in the $800 zone, after trading sideways for weeks in the $700s.    It's not entirely clear how long Bitcoin still needs to trade in the 700's to clear out latent supply, but I doubt we will notice the 800's.        — Vinny Lingham (@VinnyLingham) December 4, 2016      Apart from the usual troll tweets responding to that tweet, I also received some flattering responses.  As much as I enjoy the attention, and the emergence of nicknames such ""Bitcoin Oracle"" (Thanks to TwoBitIdiot for coining it!), I do feel the need to make a point of two things, in particular.  Firstly, I don’t have a crystal ball, and everything I say has a certain percentage chance of either occurring or not occurring – we live in a probabilistic world, so when I make a call, it's because I think the outcome is highly likely, but that does not always mean it's certain.  Secondly, I’m a macro guy , with a big picture focus. I don't look at the trading charts every day (I just don’t have the time!) and even though I don’t actively trade anymore, I do understand things like leverage, slippage and liquidity in markets quite well. I don't do technical analysis, as macro factors will shift the playing field and disrupt the charts, so in my opinion, they are often best used for looking back, and not forward.  Most of my calls are based upon fundamentals that I observed from my working knowledge of capital flows, supply and demand and other fundamental perspectives on economics, psychology, money, business, game theory and a host of other subjects – including life experiences and the differences between living in South Africa and the US (capital controls, hyperinflation leading to Zimbabwe’s currency collapse, high interest rate environments, etc).  If you have read my prior posts, you will find this to be the case when I lay out fundamentals for why I believe things in the bitcoin world will play out the way I forecast or suggest.  This is not wizardry or crystal ball stuff, it’s just observations that I have made from analyzing lots of disparate data and information derived from multiple sources and then trying to figure it all out.  And, sometimes I will be wrong.  The late 2016 price surge  That said, I believe bitcoin has performed particularly well over the past month for two primary reasons.  The first is largely due to the macro economic factors – demonetization in places like India and Venezuela, geopolitical concerns over the Trump election and most importantly but most misunderstood, the recent Fed rate hike (which puts pressure on emerging market currencies, strengthens the dollar and creates a surge in the forex/BTC trading).  In turn, this creates additional foreign buying and demand for bitcoin as a forex hedge, particularly outside the US.  The second factor is that after the $800 price mark was breached, there was a hollow supply interval between $800–$900 (ie: there were not a lot of sellers, for various reasons which would take too long to explain in this post).  This triggered an effective short squeeze and pushed the price above $900 very quickly.  We will most likely find a potentially short period of consolidation around the low $900s, before we start testing the four-digit barrier, possibly with one or two mini spikes to the mid $900s and then a sell off back into the upper $800s/low $900s as the market finds its feet.  There is also the year-end impact of profit taking around 31st December, but I don’t expect it to be outside these ranges.  Dollar interest rate hikes  As I alluded to in the previous point, the Fed interest rates impact bitcoin to a degree that most people will not grasp.  This is a topic for a much longer post, so I will need to be brief here.  Essentially, the higher the rates go, the higher the demand for bitcoin will be. The divergence that you see is happening because gold has been heavily favored by gold bugs for historical reasons (in times of crises, etc) as the go-to commodity based store of value if an economic collapse happens. This was often followed by a period of low interest rates and then inflation.  Inflation is just not happening in the US, due to quantitative easing.  As a result, gold is still overvalued, especially if the Fed now continues to raise rates, which I expect will occur. Bitcoin will rise with an interest rate hike because unlike gold, there is further upside in the capital value of bitcoin, so the need for some type of yield to offset it is greatly reduced.  When the Fed raises rates, emerging market economies have their currency devalued, which raises the effective price of bitcoin for people in those markets, creating more equity value in their bitcoins and driving up demand for more.  This is because the price to mine a bitcoin is largely uniform (electricity price aside) in every country in the world, as it’s a commodity that trades freely across global markets (labor input costs are not germane to bitcoin, unlike gold).  If your currency devalues, it just costs you more to mine a bitcoin or buy a bitcoin. The market doesn’t care how your currency is performing.  Counterarguments  Some would argue that bitcoins don’t provide yield similar to gold and therefore should be subject to the same price pressures that impact the precious metal as interest rates rise.  But, the reality is that the current market capitalization of bitcoin is fractional to gold and so, for the time being, the expected capital appreciation of bitcoin heavily discounts the need for a yield curve right now. This may change in the future.  To expand on Fed monetary policy a bit more, the world has been on a dollar-based debt binge for assets and equity over the past eight years, with record low interest rates, which partially explains the negative interest rate policy (NIRP) in some countries (watch RealVisionTV.com for more detailed info here).  When rates rise, entities (corporates or governments) have to then make interest rate payments in USD and, to do that, they then have to sell local currency. This in turn further weakens the local currencies – effectively trying to close out a dollar short position on a regular basis.  This is over and above any unwinding of carry trade positions that are no longer profitable with higher cost dollars, and so a vicious cycle ensues. Bottom line is that rate hikes devalue foreign currencies and strengthen the dollar.  This is particularly visible in countries where entities with local currency earnings have been financing dollar-denominated debts without sufficient dollar-based income.  Bitcoin is seen to be gaining in local currency price trading pairs, which makes it far more desirable and in effect increases demand, because of upward price momentum in those currencies which creates more demand for bitcoin.  $3,000 ahead  Without a doubt, bitcoin will rise further next year – I expect to be within the $3,000 range by the end of next year, as I have previously forecast.  Overall, I would compare the last price spike in 2013 to $1,255 as being ""irrational exuberance,"" similar to the peak of the dot.com bubble – so I don't expect another one like this again, but I could be wrong.  Similarly, the tech world eventually crushed those ""bubble"" highs once the technology and businesses matured and built towards higher and even more sustainable highs, post 2000.  Since the previous high for bitcoin, it has been over three years. A lot has changed since then, and I will write a follow-up post which expands on some of the topics above in greater detail, but for now, I will summarize my expectations for next year.  2017 for bitcoin  Looking ahead, we can expect reasonably low volatility for bitcoin (maybe a couple of dips here and there), a steady pace of growth, broader industry use cases and applications for bitcoin, and the adoption of Segregated Witness (SegWit) to handle scaling.  My company, Civic, is building out a blockchain-based identity platform and I’m very excited about the prospects of using a public ledger for global identity management (and no, we don’t store your personal info on the blockchain!).  Also likely is the government sponsorship or endorsement of bitcoin-related companies and more likely, government-led buying of bitcoins or investment into bitcoin mining companies or similar.  Potential government crackdowns on bitcoin in certain countries, due to capital flight or loss of exchange controls could be seen as well. But, this will drive up the bitcoin price in the black markets in those economies.  I do expect a two-to-three-times price growth overall in 2017 for the USD/BTC pair.  This may result in bitcoin prices in other currencies being up 4x to 7x, but I think it’s fair to say that USD/BTC pairing is what we should use as the benchmark.  While these are all exciting developments, there are some events that are unlikely to occur.  Parabolic growth (20x gains) are unlikely, ie: bitcoin at $10,000 is probably not going to happen in 2017.  A hard fork is also not realistic, given what happened with ethereum (I would give this a 5% chance of happening).  Consumer adoption will still trail, and I don’t believe we’re going to see mass adoption of bitcoin as a currency of any sort by average consumers. I would still argue that bitcoin is a commodity today, not a currency. That will change in time.

42399495,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjc8N,1482935405,Korea's Central Bank Considers 'Supernode' for Blockchain Oversight,"The Bank of Korea is considering the creation of a 'supernode' to help mitigate privacy concerns should it seek to adopt distributed ledger technology.  Published as part of an overview of the central bank's future plans, the report titled ""Present Status and Key Issues of Distributed Ledger Technology"" further details policy issues that it believes could hinder the growth of distributed ledgers.  Notably, in a section titled ""Application Plan"", the report's authors include several ""solutions"" to four key problems recommended by the Bank of Korea, headquartered in Seoul, South Korea.  sSpecifically, the application plan advocates for a ""supernode"" or central manager that oversees privacy controls by helping protect information about the trading partners recorded on the blockchain.  The Bank of Korea proposes that the supernode would also be responsible for issuing tokens and granting participants (or ""token users"") access to the shared ledger, and calls for a Merkle root-based implementation of a public blockchain capable of conducting 3,000 transactions per second.  From the report:  ""In order to utilize distributed ledger technology in financial services, it is necessary to resolve technical issues such as securing trade secrets, controlling authority, maintaining trust and security and securing scalability.""  If implemented, the report also concludes that a blockchain implementation could save the bank 16% of its total costs, or about ₩107.7bn, a figured based on previous research by Goldman Sachs.  The joint research report was created with the assistance of blockchain firm Coinplug, academics and financial technology “experts” according to the press release.  Data for the report was collected from April 2016 to October 2016.  New momentum  The publication is also notable as it signals another strong sign of support for the emerging technology in Asia.

42399513,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjcP6,1482933645,Ensuring Bitcoin Fungibility in 2017 (And Beyond),"David Vorick is a Bitcoin Core developer, former IBM software developer and the co-founder of decentralized cloud storage platform Sia.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Vorick tells us why ensuring fungibility remains a top priority for bitcoin developers entering 2017, and how 2016 increased awareness of what he argues is a pivotal issue.  Fungibility, put simply, is the idea that every item in a set is worth exactly the same amount.  In bitcoin, fungibility means that all bitcoins have the same value, regardless of who owns them or what their history is – and fungibility is extremely important to the success of a decentralized network.  To understand why, we have to analyze how bitcoin's current limited fungibility is creating real problems in the marketplace.  For example, it's common for exchanges and merchants to discriminate between bitcoins based on the owner or their history. An example is that exchanges will attempt to block bitcoins that have been stolen, especially if the theft was well publicized.  Other points of discrimination can extend to include bitcoins associated with drugs, gambling and other societal vices. But it's important to note, this can happen even in cases where the owner of those bitcoins hasn't engaged in any such behavior.  In short, the problem can be summed up like this: bitcoins with clean history can be accepted everywhere, while coins with dirty history can only be accepted in places that aren't performing strict background checks.  Fair trade?  The problem is not that the merchants are rejecting bitcoins associated with unfavorable activities, the problem is the effect that it has on everyone else.  When performing a trade, dirty bitcoins are less valuable than clean coins. That means that everyone needs to know when they make a trade whether the bitcoins they will be receiving are dirty or clean, because that impacts whether they are getting a fair trade and whether they will be able to spend them or cash them out through the typical avenues.  The only way to know that your bitcoins are clean is to go to a centralized service and ask for a background check. Suddenly the value of your coins is being decided by a centralized party (something that many would argue runs directly against the core values of the bitcoin project).  Every platform accepting bitcoin could implement different policies for deciding which coins are clean or dirty. And exchanges in different legal jurisdictions (US, China, India, etc) are likely to have different policies.  The bitcoins worth the most money would then be the bitcoins accepted everywhere (which would only be a small subset of available bitcoins).  This means it's not enough to just ask one exchange for a background check, you have to ask every major platform whether or not they think you have clean coins. And a platform doesn't think that you have clean coins, their decision reduces the value of your holdings regardless of whether you actually use that platform – your coins cannot be traded with any of the platform's users.  Worsening situation  2016 has increasingly seen bitcoin fungibility come under attack.  Blockchain forensics startup Elliptic was able to raise $5m for the purposes of identifying illicit bitcoins, while exchanges like Coinbase have become increasingly strict about accepting coins with known fringe histories.  So fungibility has been damaged, though not yet enough that people feel like they need to consult blacklist services before accepting bitcoins.  That day is getting closer, though, and when it arrives it will be a massive blow to the whole bitcoin ecosystem – the need to consult a blacklist service is the need to ask permission to use bitcoin.  It will mean that bitcoin has become centralized.  Because any platform in any jurisdiction can damage fungibility by choosing to discriminate between coins, most fungibility improvements come down to privacy. The best way to protect fungibility is to ensure that there's no way to tell the difference between two coins, regardless of the actual history of those coins.  Solutions  2016 has seen a lot of momentum in this direction, with many of the improvements on track to become available to the general public in 2017.  Below is a list of the most exciting things happening with regards to fungibility.  Lightning Network  Most transactions today in bitcoin go onto the permanent public ledger, available for anyone to scrutinize.  Lightning changes this equation by allowing strangers who have never met to transact without ever making a transaction on the ledger – instead doing everything off-chain through the Lightning Network.  The number of open-source Lightning implementations increased substantially in 2016, with the total number now somewhere between five and 10. This list includes implementations from Lightning, Blockstream and MIT.  Though no solution is yet ready for the masses, there has been major progress, and several implementations are promising basic releases in 2017.  Most of the existing code depends on Segregated Witness (SegWit) activation, however. Provided SegWit succeeds, 2017 should be the year that you are able to try out bitcoin's Lightning Network for yourself.  TumbleBit  A research paper for a new tumbling service was released in early 2016, TumbleBit is unlike existing tumbling services.  This was a big leap forward, as it provided tumbling service that could not scam its users, and also could not de-anonymize its users. In short, a major improvement to existing tumbling strategies.  More than just a paper, successful tumbling operations have been submitted over the live bitcoin network.  TumbleBit is not something that you can use today, however, but a command line release is expected in early 2017 and a user-friendly graphical release is expected mid year.  You can expect 2017 to be the first year where bitcoin can fully support large scale, anonymous, secure tumbling operations, and that's exciting.  Zcash  Long awaited, October 2016 finally saw the release of Zcash, a cryptocurrency in pursuit of the holy grail of fungibility.  zkSnarks, the technology behind Zcash, make it possible to achieve true fungibility, where every single coin looks identical to every other coin. The issue is that only recent computers are powerful enough to perform Zcash transactions, and there is uncertainty that the cryptography will hold up against further scrutiny.  Still, 2017 is likely to see improved performance, reduced computational requirements, and quite possibly improvements to the cryptographic protocols.  The progress that Zcash has made so far is a huge benefit to the cryptocurrency ecosystem.  Monero  Monero is a cryptocurrency with a core focus of fungibility, and its greatest strength is perhaps its philosophy, which holds that fungibility is strongest when everybody is forced to use private transactions.  Monero essentially acts as a giant on-chain coin mixer, with every single transaction participating in the mixing. This has a huge advantage over traditional mixers, as people tend to only mix their coins when they have something to hide (meaning that it's often reasonable to assume that coins are dirty merely because they've been mixed).  With Monero, that assumption is invalid, because all transactions contain mixed coins. Due to this philosophy, and due to the large number of users, Monero is perhaps the most fungibile cryptocurrency in the ecosystem, outperforming even Zcash by this attribute.  2016 saw a huge rise in popularity for Monero (placing it as the most valuable privacy-focused cryptocurrency), and saw the creation of a new protocol, RingCT, which combines Monero's traditional output mixing with the ability to disguise the value of the coins being spent.  A hard fork in early 2017 will introduce RingCT into Monero, further enhancing the privacy and fungibility of the cryptocurrency.  Coming soon  Elsewhere, 2016 has seen massive progress in the direction of privacy and fungibility.  JoinMarket, which has been under active development by multiple developers throughout 2016, is working to provide a decentralized tumbling service. Further, 2016 saw the introduction of the MimbleWimble protocol, which would allow historic transactions to be removed entirely from the blockchain.  Progress was also made on privacy-improving technologies like MAST and Schnorr signature aggregation.  It's believed Schnorr signature aggregation will allow multiparty signatures to appear like single-party signatures, while MAST will allow highly complicated scripts to appear like less-complicated scripts.  Client-side validation is an off-chain scaling technique which improves both privacy and scalability, allowing both the blockchain history and the blockchain state to be pruned, exposing tiny pieces only to those who need to see them.  Each of these improvements is good for fungibility, and each is being actively researched or developed.  With this in mind, it's safe to say that fungibility research is very active today, and is likely to produce exciting new technologies in 2017.

In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Morgan gives a high level overview of the best practices bitcoin owners, users and investors can use to secure their digital wealth in 2017.        2017 is almost here and the bitcoin price is surging!  Are you surprised by how much your bitcoin is worth? Don't let that surprise turn to dismay by losing it. Now is the perfect time to take a few basic precautions to keep your cryptocurrency secure.  Here are 8 do-it-yourself tips to help you improve your security:  1. Backup today  You can never say it enough: back up your wallet. If you haven’t yet backed up your wallet, do it now.  Most hardware and software wallets use an industry standard backup protocol called BIP 39 that allows your wallet backup to be 12, 18, or 24 English words.  It's important to write the words down, on paper, in order, and securely store the backup somewhere safe from people, water and fire. If you don’t back up your wallet, you could well lose your bitcoin. Forever.  2. Check on your backups  If you have backed up your wallet, check on the backup locations.  The new year is a perfect time to check on your important papers, including your wallet backups. Can you still access them? Can you still read the words? Are they secure from fire, water and theft? If you've given the backups to someone else (lawyer, accountant), ask them to check their storage.  Do they still have them? Verify the location and security of your backups.  3. Set a calendar reminder  While we all know we should be checking our backups, wallets and estate plans regularly, it's hard to remember to do it.  Add a reminder to your calendar now, to check all these things again in three, six or at most 12 months.  4. Move money off your smartphone  With the increase in the bitcoin price, you might be shocked at how much money you've been carrying around on your smartphone.  Now is a great time to move your coins onto a hardware wallet or into cold storage. Hardware wallets are very easy to use, with user-friendly software components, and are considered one of the safest ways to store bitcoin.  While it's great to carry petty cash or spending money on your phone, never carry more bitcoin on your smartphone than you would carry as cash in your wallet.  5. Move your money off exchanges  If you have coins sitting on an exchange, move them out today to a wallet you control.  Most of the popular exchanges pool coins and while you have a ""balance"" showing on your account, you do not actually control the keys. If the exchange gets hacked you could lose your money. Remember that you only control the bitcoin if you control the keys: ""not your keys, not your bitcoin"".  6. Upgrade to two-factor authentication  Add two-factor authentication to your bitcoin-related accounts and to all other important online accounts. The best two-factor solution is a hardware token and you can buy one for just $20–$30.  Otherwise use a smartphone authentication app, such as Authy or Google Authenticator. SMS is not a very good two-factor solution, though it is still better than none at all.  7. Use a password manager  Humans are great at identifying patterns and that makes us terrible at randomness. Password best practices – choose a different random password for each site, never write them down – pose management problems.  For most people, the only way to accomplish this is to use a password manager – one which generates and stores your passwords securely on multiple devices. Popular managers include 1Password, LastPass, and the open source KeePass.  Many offer free basic services, with premium services costing less than $80 per year. They're easy to use and in just a couple of weeks you’ll never want to be without one again.  8. Plan for your family  If something happened to you tomorrow would your family be able to access your bitcoin? While this tip takes time to implement, it's worth it.  It shouldn’t take you more than an hour to make a plan and decide who you want to get what, write down instructions and tell your family about your plan.  Be sure to consult an attorney, to make sure your plan is consistent with local law and can’t be challenged in a court. If you have a will, trust, or other estate plan, let your attorney know that you have new assets that need to be included in your plan.  Getting your first bitcoin is becoming easier and easier, but keeping it safe from hackers, insolvent exchanges, and loss isn't as easy.  These 8 tips will help you bring in the new year with a renewed sense of confidence that you can safeguard the bitcoin that you have, especially now that it’s worth a lot more.

42421071,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXFlYD,1482922851,2016 in Headlines: The Year's 13 Biggest Blockchain Stories,"In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, CoinDesk's editorial team looks back on the stories and narratives that shaped the industry over the last 12 months and that cast a shadow on the year ahead.  2016 will go down as one of the most formative years for blockchain tech.  We saw tremendous hype as major enterprises invested big in distributed ledger and blockchain tech, and frustration as more established cryptocurrencies (most notably bitcoin) continued to struggle with mass adoption in the face of complex technical challenges.  But under the surface, it was perhaps a year that most often defied existing assumptions.  From governments worldwide embracing blockchain solutions to major hacks, thefts and blockchain schisms, this year saw old assumptions collapse and stronger foundations laid for the future.  These are the stories that changed the rules of the game most significantly, redefining the industry that is fast growing around the technology.  Overall, we looked for stories that had an impact across industry sectors, and that encouraged those in the industry to think deeply about our evolving technology and how it is likely to be deployed.  Bank of England Explores Distributed Ledger Tech for Settlements  Few knew then, but when the Bank of England revealed in January that it would consider the impact of using distributed ledgers as part of the UK's settlement system, it would prove the first in a series of announcements from central banks.  While central banks had before released papers on the technology, the Bank of England's statements were notable given they positioned central banks not as afraid of a disruptive technology, but as a group poised to capitalize on it.  Other central banks soon followed. Earlier this month, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan announced a joint research effort into the potential use of blockchain tech, while the US Federal Reserve has released its findings into researching the risks and rewards of using distributed ledgers.  While no central bank has taken definitive action, the rhetoric continues to suggest experimentations at these organizations are ongoing – and that central bank blockchains could soon migrate out of the lab.  IBM Goes Big on Blockchain, Unveiling Services Suite and Strategy  The fourth-largest software producer in 2016  and the third-largest server manufacturer, IBM has distinguished itself as the fount for innovation, holding the record for most patents received for the year for the 23rd consecutive year.  So, it was shocking to many when IBM announced in February that the 105-year-old company had come up with a blockchain strategy for the delivery of its cloud-based business solutions (given that businesses seemed largely reluctant to aggressively back blockchain in years past).  Still, that didn't stop IBM from revealing an ambitious multi-year plan that incorporated existing assets such as IBM zSystems – the principal IT system for the world’s top banks, the Watson Internet of Things (IoT) platform and Bluemix Garage into a blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) offering.  As the year went on, there would prove no shortage of announcements from IBM, both as a company, and as a leading member of the Hyperledger blockchain project, which swelled to 100 global members.  Ethereum Blockchain Project Launches First Production Release  Following its inaugural release – Frontier – in 2015, the blockchain platform ethereum released its first production version, dubbed Homestead, in March of this year.  Prior to the release, ethereum had largely gained notoriety and mainstream recognition due to the success of its crowdsale of ether tokens, but with Homestead, the platform emerged as a technology to watch.  Amid a surge in market cap and value growth, major companies began branding ethereum ""bitcoin 2.0"", embracing the technology with a rare enthusiasm.  Yet, the Homestead announcement was also notable for the outsized introductory statements by ethereum's enthusiasts.  ""Homestead's arrival will begin to demonstrate the next generation of blockchain technology, whereby anything we can dream of, can be accomplished in a decentralized manner using ethereum,"" Andrew Keys, co-founder of ConsenSys Enterprises, told CoinDesk at the time.  Such statements would set the stage for difficulties in late 2016 as ethereum hit a series of public growing pains.  R3 Announces Corda, a New Distributed Ledger Technology  But even as open-source efforts progressed, businesses seemed more interested in alternative solutions.  Soon after ethereum's big debut, New York-based startup R3CEV announced in April that it was working on a decentralized platform specifically designed for financial institutions. But while Corda offered a more private version of blockchain technology, its aims were similarly ambitious.  ""Our conclusion is that distributed ledger and blockchain technology represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform the economics of data management across the financial industry,"" wrote Richard Gendal Brown, chief technology officer at R3, on his blog about this project.  Other differences between the platform and competing solutions were more notable.  Building a theoretical system that can respect and work around the reporting obligations and inter-organizational relationships that define modern finance, R3 revealed it was seeking to create a network that would provide both ""supervisory observer nodes"" (which could be used to oversee the system) and selectively include data (ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive data).  More could be in store for the tech in 2017, however.  Since the announcement, R3 has shared its open-sourced Corda code to the HyperLedger project and revealed a roadmap for its work in 2017.  Doubts Cast As Craig Wright Publishes Proof He Created Bitcoin  Since the creation of bitcoin, questions have persisted about the identity of the anonymous author of its white paper.  Yet, Satoshi Nakamoto did leave clues. In written posts, his (or her) grasp of English and use of British idioms and metaphors led many to believe that Nakamoto was not the Japanese man the name suggested.  In December 2015, this piece of the puzzle seemed to fall into place when Wired and Gizmodo published reports alleging that the creator of bitcoin may be Craig Steven Wright, an Australian entrepreneur and former academic who has worked with K-Mart and the Australian Security Exchange.  The reports also alleged that Dave Kleiman, a computer forensics expert, may have played a significant role, though the authors were not convinced at the time that they had the right men.  Then, on 2nd May, Wright publicly declared that he was, indeed, Nakamoto.  Making a claim that was validated by Bitcoin Foundation founding director Jon Matonis and Bitcoin Core developer Gavin Andresen, Wright sent a message – the validity of which was refuted by many in the community.  Though Wright would give up on defending his claim, the drama nonetheless served to stoke mainstream interest in bitcoin as a technology.  Apache Foundation Founder Named HyperLedger Executive Director  Faced with the possibility of having too many cooks in the kitchen, the Hyperledger project set the tone for its management in May by appointing Brian Behlendorf as its inaugural executive director.  The founder of the Apache Software Foundation, Behlendorf quickly interpreted his primary role as being to streamline the new members' onboarding process.  Stating at the time that  , ""It shouldn’t take three weeks to make your first pull request,"" Behlendorf sought to create a system so that new members could start contributing to the fabric immediately, and work soon began.  Over the course of 2016, the project would develop a thriving mailing list and hold a seemingly never-ending schedule of open hackathons.  But at the center of this effort was Behlendorf, who, while new to the industry, wasn't quiet about extending support to other open-source projects or his desire to solve big problems.  ""I’ve been as frustrated as anybody in technology about how broken the world seems,"" Behlendorf said to the MIT Technology Review in November. ""Corruption or bureaucracy or inefficiency are in some ways technology problems. Couldn’t this just be fixed?""  Bitcoin Halving 2016  For more than a year, the bitcoin community anticipated, fretted and speculated on what ""the halving"", or the scheduled reduction of the reward given to bitcoin miners, would mean for the health of the network.  Some speculated that the halving would lead to a decline in the price of bitcoin (as it would scare off speculative buyers), while others predicted a long-term hike in prices (based on the fact that new supply would shrink).  Despite all the theories, however, the halving ultimately had little effect on the market (other than to serve as a cause for celebration among bitcoiners).  Indeed, in an industry fraught with excessive drama, it was oddly unifying event.  Bitcoin prices may have dropped 10% immediately after the halving, but as the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index shows, this was a mere speed bump in a banner year for the digital currency.  The DAO Attacked: Code Issue Leads to $60 Million Ether Theft  If ethereum sparked initial interest, its first decentralized app (The DAO) would give the business world a glimpse of what a blockchain could do beyond cryptocurrency.  Core to its impact was the notion that smart contracts could become powerful business tools, potentially redefining how we understand data storage and data sharing. Suffice to say, when The DAO's developers admitted to being hacked, it set off warning bells.  The incident would lead to a massive sell-off on ether and the controversial forking of the ethereum blockchain to restore the lost ethers to the DAO.  All told, The DAO's hack set the stage for major controversy, leading to the original unforked ethereum blockchain to be preserved and maintained as ethereum classic – a wholly separate cryptocurrency network.  Months later, the event continues to provide fodder for analysis.  While some may see it as a cautionary tale, others believe The DAO provided just a preview of the disruptive power blockchain (and ethereum in particular) could have at scale.  Bitcoin Drops Nearly 20% Following Exchange Hack  Summer, it seemed, was the time for bad news.  Not long after The DAO's struggles, another cryptocurrency hack saw more than $60m in bitcoin stolen from Bitfinex, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. The incident represented the largest single loss of bitcoins since the 2014 collapse of Mt Gox, which saw 744,408 bitcoins disappear.  Flustering an already declining bitcoin market, bitcoin prices dropped from $560.16 to $480 in a single day, with Bitfinex’s decision to halt trading following the breach directly contributing to this drop.  Months later, the event would still have an impact on markets, with traders reporting the loss of liquidity in the ecosystem as a key contributor.  However, bitcoin prices would recover in light of growing international economic instability, with prices reaching a 34-month high as the year came to a close.  Investors Are Going Wild for a Digital Currency Called Zcash  Even as bitcoin and blockchain cultures clashed in 2016, common problems did emerge, and none may have been more prevalent than privacy.  The announcement of Zcash in October sought to change that.  Using a cryptographic tool that does not requires the exchanging of information between the parties engaged in a transaction, the Zcash blockchain promised a level of anonymity that had not been seen before with distributed ledgers.  To vet this claim, Zcash launched a beta in September to not only shake out any bugs that would impair its public launch, but also to test the anonymity of its system (the company spent $250,000 on an audit alone).  The possibility of a hack-resilient, anonymous blockchain stirred up investor enthusiasm, with Zcash futures contracts spiking from $18 in September to $261 ahead of the blockchain’s launch.  Months later, though, Zcash has largely failed to deliver on anything other than speculation.  Despite briefly reaching outlandish price highs of millions of dollars per coin at launch, the price has dropped dramatically to less than $50.  The IRS Seeks Data on Coinbase's Bitcoin Customers  In what seems to be a possible worse-case scenario for bitcoin privacy advocates, the IRS dropped a bombshell in November when it requested the records of bitcoin users held by Coinbase in November.  Referring to a group of ""John Does"", the government is now seeking information on a group of bitcoin users that allegedly avoided or failed to pay taxes on cryptocurrency transactions.  Said the US government  : ""The 'John Doe' summons relates to the investigation of an ascertainable group or class of persons, that is, United States taxpayers who, at any time during the years ended December 31, 2013, through December 31, 2015, conducted transactions in a convertible virtual currency as defined in IRS Notice 2014-21.""  This investigation indicates a new interest from regulators in policing cryptocurrency use and comes two years after the IRS declared cryptocurrency to be a taxable tradable commodity and not a virtual currency.  Early signs are this won't be the last of the case, either.  Besides the “John Does,” the IRS is seeking information on two cases concerning ""corporate entities with annual revenues of several million dollars.”  Goldman Sachs Leaves R3 Blockchain Consortium  Long the bulwark of blockchain projects, the first defection from banking consortium R3CEV sent shockwaves through the industry when Goldman Sachs opted not to renew its membership in November.  Adding to the perceived impact was the fact that Goldman was one of the nine original founding members of the consortium, and the company declared at the time that it would continue to develop blockchain projects on its own.  Revelations that Santander had also dropped out of the consortium and rumors of funding difficulties only added to the drama.  Still, the importance of the event might have been oversold. The majority of member banks have reportedly agreed to participate in R3's funding round, which could become the largest in industry history.  Further, in hindsight, difficulties among the more than 50 members was likely to be expected.  ""Developing technology like this requires dedication and significant resources, and our diverse pool of members all have different capacities and capabilities which naturally change over time,"" said a R3CEV spokesperson to the Wall Street Journal in response to the departure.  Circle Ends Bitcoin Buying and Selling in Product Pivot  The event that perhaps best exemplifies bitcoin's struggles on the business side, Circle announced in December that it would no longer offer bitcoin exchange services.  Further, it revealed its newest product, Spark, would be a smart contracts platform allowing users to use networks other than bitcoin to settle bitcoin transactions (this could include other blockchain networks or a traditional payment settlement network like ACH).  Making the anouncement, Circle argued (and many agreed) that bitcoin technology was no longer central to its mission.  “We have never been focused on convincing consumers to replace their familiar native currencies with bitcoin, but instead wanted to bring the benefits of public blockchains and digital assets to consumers without requiring them to know the technical details,” read the Circle blog post.  Whether Circle's move comes in isolation or it's the harbinger of a trend for 2017, however, is still in question.  Notably, Circle's announcement came just weeks before a strong uptick in the price of bitcoin that still continues, an event that did much to suggest interest in the digital asset remains alive and well.
