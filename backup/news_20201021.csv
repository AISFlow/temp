With a strong correlation between stocks and the price of bitcoin (BTC) in recent months, analysts say a stimulus package could boost BTC as well.

White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on CNBC negotiators were running out of time to get a deal passed before the presidential election. The talks went on past a Tuesday evening deadline set by Pelosi.  The White House has proposed a $1.8 trillion stimulus package while the Democrat-majority House of Representatives are holding out for $2.2 trillion.  Should President Donald Trump lose the presidential election, the WSJ article noted, the chances for a quick passage post-election would be slim as the Democrats would likely want to wait until Joe Biden takes office to get a bigger package approved.

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $12,709 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 6.4% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $11,863-$12,916  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price has been on a tear this week, rising for the third straight day and hitting as high as $12,916 on spot exchange Bitstamp on Wednesday. The recent development from payments firm PayPal confirming it will incorporate crypto for its users and merchants helped sparked the record 2020 high for the world’s oldest cryptocurrency, at $12,709 as of press time.      Read More: PayPal Pledges to Bring Crypto to 26M Merchants, Confirming Market Entry      “PayPal dropped the most important piece of news for large retail adoption this year, full support for bitcoin,” noted Henrik Kugelberg, an over-the-counter crypto trader based in Sweden. PayPal’s stock price (NASDAQ: PYPL) is also hitting record highs in 2020 and is up 92% this year so far.      The potential for bitcoin to be inserted further into consumer finance is what is helping its bull run, noted Zac Prince, CEO of crypto lender BlockFi. “This coalescing of fintech and bitcoin is yet another bullish development for investors,” he said. “It's going to be an exciting 12 months ahead as bitcoin continues to expand further into consumer finance.""      It is not just the PayPal news helping bitcoin trend higher, noted Micah Erstling, a trader at GSR. “It's promising to see bitcoin holding above the $12,000 mark with continued institutional interest and wider regulated adoption taking place,” Erstling told CoinDesk. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech on central bank digital currencies (CBDC) ""clearly demonstrates that digital assets are being taken seriously, while Square and PayPal headlines are fueling a better digital ecosystem via payments and treasury.”      The last time bitcoin hit this price level was back on July 10, 2019. The overall excitement has led to volume on major USD/BTC spot exchanges Wednesday that were much higher than normal, at $1,165,166,691 as of press time. In fact, the last time volume was so high was back on Sept. 4, when daily volume was $1,089,417,516.      Several market analysts see bitcoin heading much higher before 2020 is over, including Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for Fairlead Strategies. “The breakout in July put the next major resistance on the chart at the 2019 high, aligned with a long-term Fibonacci retracement level near $14,000, she said. “We think a test of this level is likely in the months ahead.”      Constantin Kogan, a partner at cryptocurrency fund-of-funds BitBull Capital, echoed that sentiment. “Bitcoin has a good chance of reaching its $14,000 resistance mark for about a two-times gain this year as the market hasn’t fully absorbed all the positive news.”      As for derivatives, bitcoin open interest on CME, a venue for sophisticated investors that is often used to hedge risks, has been on an uptrend, noted William Purdy, a derivatives trader and founder of analysis firm PurdyAlerts.      “Futures open interest rising as price rising is a bullish trend that suggests the trend will likely to continue as fresh money is seen entering the market,” said Purdy. “CME volume surging shows strong institutional interest.”      Read More: Kik, SEC Propose $5M Settlement Over $100M ICO, Ending Yearlong Battle      However, quant trader QCP Capital highlighted some 2020 uncertainty still ahead in its investor note Wednesday. “We look to the U.S. elections as a medium-term risk still. With all the regulatory reminders we've already had this month, anything emanating from that department around election time would be a major cause for concern.”    Ether dominance slips    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Wednesday trading around $391 and climbing 6.2% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      After hitting a 2020 high of 14% on Sept. 1, ether’s share of the cryptocurrency market cap has declined. A measure of an asset versus the larger crypto market capitalization, “dominance” is a metric traders watch to gauge sentiment. As of press time, the number was at 11.7% Wednesday.      Despite the drop, George Clayton, managing partner at investment firm Cryptanalysis Capital, doesn’t put too much stock in ether’s dominance decline and remains ebullient on decentralized finance, or DeFi, deployed on the Ethereum network. “DeFi has Ethereum going gangbusters – lots of utility going on,” he said “I cannot be bearish ETH.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all green Wednesday.

42432968,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2R3h,1603307816,What the History of Headphones Says About the Internet's Future,"Predicting the blockchain future is easy. Knowing when to try is hard.      I’m going to talk about the future of the internet and blockchain technology, but first, let’s talk about noise-cancelling headphones.    John Wolpert is the group executive in charge of enterprise mainnet at ConsenSys AG and the chair of the technical steering committee of the Baseline Protocol. This article is part of CoinDesk's Internet 2030 series, exploring the future of the digital economy.  Eighty-seven years to a headset    In 1933, Paul Lueg submitted a patent application describing the principle of noise cancellation. But it wasn’t until Amar Bose started work on the concept in 1978 that the path to a practical commercial product emerged. It was another two decades before processing power per milliwatt could cancel out the drone of an airplane in an affordable device that ran on batteries.      So imagine if, in 1933, someone asked Lueg what the world would be like in 10 years, and if he thought it would include computers with the ability to grab sound waves from the air and cancel them out. He would probably have asked, “What’s a computer?”      It was possible in 1933 to imagine a device like the Bose headset, but it wasn’t possible to plot any kind of reasonable trajectory toward a real product. But after Gordon Moore correctly asserted the silicon lithography process would double the number of transistors you could place in the same amount of space every two years, companies like Bose could do the math and predict when chips might deliver the speed and efficiency needed to detect a sound wave and drive a speaker to cancel out the sound, in a fraction's fraction of a second.    A question of scale    What will the internet look like in 2030? And specifically, will blockchain technology have a material impact on the way the internet of 2030 enables people to conduct business and live their lives? Whether or not we can answer these questions depends on whether blockchain has arrived at a stage of continuous improvement or whether we’re still waiting for new paradigm shifts.      The most important consideration for any new internet technology is scale. The internet scales because at its core it is largely stateless. Internet routers receive a packet of data and pass it to the next router. They don’t need to remember anything about those packets, and they don't store the packet or check with other routers on the state of a packet before sending it along.    The stateful internet    Decentralized technology, and especially public blockchains like Ethereum, hold the promise of adding value to the internet by introducing state to this stateless system – what I call the stateful internet.    An example of state: The state of that airplane was 30,000 feet traveling at 500 mph and now its new state is 30,100 feet traveling at 501 mph.    Without shared state there is no shared truth, no way to agree the plane is at 30,100 feet or discover which of us is wrong if we disagree. We’re living the downsides of our failure to achieve shared truth everywhere today, both philosophically and technologically.      However, there is significant overhead involved in remembering things and coordinating between different machines that might have different memories about the same thing. Managing state makes it hard to achieve massive scale.      See also: Paul Brody – How Small Business Can Achieve ‘Economies of Scale’ by 2030      We can’t know when blockchains will have a significant impact on the internet’s utility until we can write the “Moore’s Law” of scaling global state machines (e.g., public blockchains).    Compartmentalization and privacy    The second most important thing to remember when considering what decentralized state machines could do to change our experience of the internet is the need to balance transparency and compartmentalization of information.      Neither the today’s internet nor blockchains are very good at data compartmentalization. Any cryptographer or IT security professional will tell you that encrypting data is good, but without the ability to compartmentalize access to the actual bits – scrambled or not – encryption just increases the amount of time it will take to expose your information.      This is a particular issue for a stateful system like a blockchain. At least with the internet you must catch packets in flight and figure out which ones need to be reassembled with others to reconstitute a coherent message. But with a blockchain, the data is at rest. If you have a copy of the ledger, you have all the information stored there and can go to work decrypting data, decompiling business logic and analyzing metadata.    A blockchain will never be as good at that as a similar system that isn’t decentralized.    The question isn’t how we can get infinite levels of scaling and privacy. The question is how much scale and privacy do we need to do useful work with the reliability and performance required by industry. If we expect the internet to serve as the back end to any and all applications – from enterprise recordkeeping to Twitch gaming – the level at which it needs to scale may border on defying the laws of physics.      Even a massively sharded distributed database, involving no blockchain-style consensus algorithm, couldn’t handle the reading and writing of data for even a vanishingly small percentage of the applications out there. And even if we built a blockchain that could handle the throughput, most of us wouldn’t be comfortable having that kind of data, even encrypted, sitting in shared memory for others to read and analyze. No.      Most, if not all, applications should avoid using decentralized systems like public – or even private – blockchains to read and write persistent data.      At the frontlines of the user experience, we want performance. We want the data as close to the computation as possible and we don’t want to have to worry about other applications gumming up the system’s responsiveness. A blockchain will never be as good at that as a similar system that isn’t decentralized.    Real use    So, if the stateful internet isn’t going to be a back end for all application data, what should we use it for? One practical use is to manage cryptographic proofs that allow you to know that records in your recordkeeping system are verifiably identical to the matching records in my system and that multi-party workflows maintain integrity. This general and limited use makes the compartmentalization problem irrelevant and sets the read-write performance requirements at attainable levels.      For example, I need to know that you and I both have the same purchase order information, so that I’m not surprised with an incorrect invoice or a delayed delivery date. To do this, we need a common frame of reference, a baseline. The public mainnet can provide the common frame of reference to let our respective systems maintain that baseline without either of us being able to say we “didn’t get the memo” or that we fat-fingered the price when we read it off the fax and typed it into the computer. These sorts of confirmations usually don’t need to be instantaneous. An acceptable time frame can be a minute, an hour or even a day. And often they can be batched.      See also: ‘Boring Is the New Exciting’: How Baseline Protocol Connected With 600 Corporates      So, what would be the minimum level of performance of a stateful Internet that could confirm consistency for B2B events such as payments and inventory control? The number of non-cash payments between companies has been estimated to be around 1.6 billion a day. Let’s say that another 6.4 billion non-payment events like purchase orders, RFPs and back-order notices would also require shared records to be baselined. That’s 10 billion events a day, give or take a few billion.      The true limitation here is the speed of coordinating a write to memory consistently across all machines maintaining the system. Sharding, and the ability to continuously improve the number of shards that can be added before performance degradation exceeds the marginal benefit of the next shard, is the key to scaling the stateful internet to provide this baseline service to industry.      Just as there are many other uses for silicon chips than noise cancellation, there are many other uses of a public blockchain like Ethereum. But what’s nice about the “baseline” case is that it sets specific requirements in order for practical applications to start going up the adoption curve.    The Moore’s Law of sharded blockchains    Perhaps we are on the cusp of a “Moore’s Law” for blockchain that might say something like this: “The number of on-chain proofs that can be deposited on a mainnet shard with common addressing to all other mainnet shards doubles every 18 months.”      Perhaps not. But it seems likely that the next 18 months will tell us a lot, as Ethereum 2.0 rolls out and advancements from there hopefully increase confidence in the ability for additional sharding.      If we are there, if Ethereum 2.0 works and shows a path of continuous improvement, then we can expect the next ten years to deliver a stateful internet that, at the very least, will be a useful way to keep business data in sync. If Eth 2.0 doesn’t deliver on promises, or if unexpected problems arise in the sharding scheme, then we will be looking for new paradigm shifts.      See also: Ben Edgington – It’s Time to Launch the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain      Whether or not we can predict a 10-year timeline, what seems likely is we are on our way to a stateful internet.

42432963,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2Qxh,1603306018,Villanova University to Send Private Ethereum Blockchain Into Space to Test Inter-Satellite Communication,"Villanova University's College of Engineering is sending a private Ethereum blockchain into space to test whether distributed ledger technology (DLT) can help satellites exchange data.      Working in collaboration with the non-profit Teachers in Space, Villanova's engineering school secured a flight for its blockchain on a Firefly Aerospace rocket slated for launch on Nov. 20 from the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The rocket will carry a “Serenity” satellite that will include Villanova’s private blockchain mounted on a Raspberry Pi, a credit card-sized single board computer.      Hasshi Sudler, an adjunct professor at Villanova who is leading this project, said the large number of communications and other types of satellites that are already in space brought into focus how blockchain technology could help this sector. Currently, there are almost 2,800 man-made satellites orbiting Earth, 1,425 of which belong to the U.S., according to data collected by the Union of Concerned Scientists.      This concentration of satellites in outer space means there could be constraints on launching new ones in the future, Sudler said. But this also creates an opportunity to reduce the number of new satellites needed by creating a way for existing satellites to communicate with each other.      “We want to be able to allow satellites to leverage the existing data that current satellites have, but that raises the question of how do you do that transfer and ensure that the transaction has taken place, even ensure that it's been paid for. And this is where the blockchain plays a unique role,” he said.      According to Sudler, moving data from one satellite to another can be a lengthy process involving multiple ground stations that stay in touch with the satellite. Using a blockchain network to transact this data could reduce such requirements and lower the operational cost of maintaining ground stations if satellites could ""talk"" to each other in space.      The blockchain that will be sent into space uses a Proof-of-Authority consensus mechanism as a way of minimizing energy requirements, which can be quite significant compared with those mechanisms commonly used in public blockchains.      In an emailed statement, Villanova said the satellite will remain in low-Earth orbit (altitude of 1,200 miles or less) for 30 days. The first 15 days will be used for controlled blockchain experiments conducted by researchers, followed by 15 days of testing to measure transaction performance under heavy traffic conditions.      Using blockchain may also rectify another problem when it comes to satellites: their movements. “If you have a number of satellites talking to one another and moving in and out of view of each other fairly quickly, it makes it difficult for the entire network to establish consensus really quickly,” said Sudler.      According to the university’s statement, the flight planned for Nov. 20 is the first of many aimed at testing how low-Earth-orbit satellites could carry out transactions using a private blockchain.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/21/villanova-university-to-send-private-ethereum-blockchain-into-space-to-test-inter-satellite-communication,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3f9ca2fae5748313daf2e7c2c106cba39c32d971-1500x762.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432959,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2Qjh,1603305895,Baby Steps or Handcuffs? Crypto Pros Assess PayPal’s Bitcoin Play,"Call it Crypto Lite – for now.      Fintech giant PayPal confirmed its long-awaited move into digital assets Wednesday, offering its 346 million users the chance to buy, hold and sell bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether and litecoin, with the blessing of New York state regulators.      While the cryptosphere acknowledges the bullishness of a firm the size of PayPal making a move into the space, there was also concern the new service does not allow bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to be withdrawn or deposited. Once you buy the coins, they stay in your account until you sell.      “Currently, you can only hold the cryptocurrencies that you buy on PayPal in your account. Additionally, the crypto in your account cannot be transferred to other accounts on or off Paypal,” states the PayPal FAQ page published with Wednesday’s announcement.      Self-custody and moving your coins around is what crypto is all about though, right?      The view from some informed takes is that while PayPal did not need to impose such restrictions, it’s probably a case of taking things by degree – a “crawl before you can walk” approach.      Read more: PayPal Embraces Crypto, Igniting Market as Mainstream Adoption Inches Closer      As such, the current setup is being compared to investment company Robinhood – which also offers crypto but in a confined space – but moving in the direction of Square, which started the same but now allows limited withdrawals to non-custodial wallets.      The lack of withdrawals to self-custody and inability to transfer between accounts constituted “the highlight of the PayPal news” for Jake Chervinsky, general counsel of DeFi platform Compound, who added that such restrictions aren’t required for regulatory compliance. (Chervinsky did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.)      However, it may well be the case that PayPal is simply setting out to cater to what it perceives to be the needs of the average user, pointed out Jerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank.      “Simply allowing people the ability to buy and hold and sell back crypto I imagine is something they studied,” Brito said in an interview. “It may simply be that’s what most people want to do with cryptocurrency at the moment, and the demand to move it around and transact is not as high. And if that’s the case, it’s much easier from a regulatory perspective and from a user support perspective to simply allow that option without having the ability to transact.”      Read more: Square Puts 1% of Total Assets in Bitcoin in Surprise $50M Investment      Providing the most obvious route for people to have exposure to the asset class without necessarily getting into the more complex issues of running private keys and understanding cryptography and digital signatures is possibly what PayPal is thinking, said Charles Hayter, CEO and co-founder of data site CryptoCompare.      “Yes, if you’re a pure libertarian, it’s not ideal. But being pragmatic about bitcoin’s trajectory and global adoption penetration rate, this certainly brings more options,” Hayter told CoinDesk.    PayPal plays it safe    Brito of Coin Center agreed that to be compliant with regulations, PayPal did not perhaps need to wall in its garden, but he pointed to gray areas like the Financial Action Task Force’s Travel Rule and other areas of anti-money laundering (AML) enforcement, which come into play when transferring crypto in a regulated environment.      “It’s certainly the case that it’s a much bigger hurdle to allow for sending [crypto] than not,” Brito said. “So, sort of top of the list would be the Travel Rule. People are finally developing solutions to comply with that but they are not there yet. This will be a relatively small part of PayPal’s business, so the easiest thing to do is not engage in transfer and take on that compliance risk.”      Read more: PayPal, Venmo to Roll Out Crypto Buying and Selling: Sources      Stephen Palley, a partner at the Anderson Kill law firm, said the functionality of the PayPal crypto announcement is not important compared to what it says about crypto as an asset class.      “They’re going to be cautious, and they’re going to roll it out slowly,” Palley told CoinDesk, adding:    “My takeaway is that the importance is not the functionality. The importance is from the normalization of the asset class.

The total value locked in Harvest Finance surged to $704.1 million on Tuesday, up 110% from $334.41 million a week earlier.  The project is now ranked seventh on DeFi Pulse in total value locked (TVL), surpassing popular DeFi projects including Synthetix, yearn.finance, RenVM, and Balancer.  According to Harvest Finance's website, the total value of its deposits has crossed $1 billion Wednesday.  Harvest Finance’s dramatic growth took place during a time when enthusiasm around the DeFi space has slowly hit a wall.  The anonymous team behind the project told CoinDesk in a Telegram message the gain was partly due to “vault migration,” meaning users were moving their funds from existing pools to newly created ones in order to maximize returns on assets.  The asset management platform, which was launched in September, aims to make so-called “yield farming” easier for small and novice investors in the DeFi sector.  According to Harvest Finance, yield farming has become harder for small investors due to volatility in the DeFi space, high transaction fees and potential security risks on smart contracts.  The project itself is audited by third parties and 10% of the protocol’s token supply is used to support the audit process.  The platform’s token FARM also saw a big jump, up by 35.72% over the past 24 hours, according to Messari.  At the press time, FARM was trading at $322.64.

The Bahamian central bank unveiled the world's first CBDC. Kik and the SEC are nearing an end to a yearlong court battle over its $100 million initial coin offering (ICO). Here's everything people are talking about in crypto today.    Top shelf    PayPal’s play PayPal will be offering trading and transaction of bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether and litecoin in the next few weeks to its 346 million customers and 26 million merchants through a partnership with Paxos Trust Company, although for some users, the features are already available. The New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) has granted the first “conditional BitLicense” to PayPal, a regulatory arrangement where interested companies can operate in the state’s “virtual currency marketplace” by working with already chartered firms. “DFS will continue to encourage and support financial service providers to operate, grow, remain and expand in New York and work with innovators to enable them to germinate and test their ideas,” the watchdog said. Many in the industry see this as a year-defining event that could rapidly expand crypto's pool of potential users. Others take umbrage that the payments firm will not initially allow users to transfer crypto outside of the PayPal network. “You own the cryptocurrency you buy on PayPal but will not be provided with a private key,” the company wrote in a help post.      Another allocation Mode Global Holdings, a London Stock Exchange-listed company, has announced plans to make a “significant purchase” of bitcoin as part of its treasury investment strategy. The fintech group said it will convert up to 10% of its cash reserves into the cryptocurrency as part of a long-term strategy to ""protect investors' assets from currency debasement."" ""Faced with the challenges of COVID-19 and with U.K. interest rates at the lowest level in the Bank of England's 326-year history, our confidence in the long-term value of bitcoin has only increased,"" said Jonathan Rowland, Mode's executive chairman.      It’s official The Central Bank of the Bahamas has officially launched its national digital currency, the sand dollar, an attempt to reduce the friction of bringing financial services to its dispersed, and often underbanked, population. This marks the first official deployment of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), which will be rolled out initially to private-sector banks and credit unions. Personal wallets are secured with multi-factor authentication security and will be mobile-based, servicing the 90% of the population with smartphones. The sand dollar is backed 1:1 to the Bahamian dollar (BSD), which, in turn, is pegged to the U.S. dollar.      Future bulls? Bitcoin futures traders are significantly less bullish as bitcoin traded past $12,000 Tuesday compared to when bitcoin reached the same level nearly two months ago. When bitcoin traded near $12,000 throughout August, finally reaching the key level mid-month, funding rates for perpetual futures turned acutely positive across leading derivative exchanges, reflecting the market's bullishness. As bitcoin revisited $12,000 Tuesday, however, funding rates reacted differently, staying flat or turning negative, indicating a lack of the same bullishness two months ago.      Decentralization metric A New York law firm unveiled a new metric to test the decentralization of particular blockchain projects. Called the “Ketsal Open Standards” rubric, the toolkit, developed by the Ketsal law firm, outlines 33 data points – including node count, GitHub statistics and measurements of the inter-node communication times – to weigh the distribution of a network. The lawyers looked to Bitcoin as the benchmark. “It’s a tool to push along an informed discussion on what you’re talking about when you’re saying, ‘my network is decentralized,’” Ketsal partner Josh Garcia said.

Tim Swanson, head of market intelligence at clearmatics, noted the penalty – if approved – would be in line with another high-profile lawsuit and settlement from last year: Block.one’s $24 million paid for a $4.1 billion unregistered securities offering.      More pattern pieces were placed earlier this year when Telegram paid a fine and abandoned its blockchain-based network. Kik, however, plans to keep its Kin network alive, with promises to alert the watchdog of any future token sales.      For many, including CoinDesk, Kik’s persistence in fighting the SEC was a laudable effort. In 2019, Ted Livingston, Kik CEO, was named Most Influential for his determination to bring the fight to court, potentially creating a precedent for how token sales might be treated under U.S. securities law.      Pressure mounted in recent months, especially after a judge found Kik’s ICO in clear violation of the Howey Test, the gold standard to determine whether an asset is a security.      Kik General Counsel Eileen Lyon said the SEC should create clear rules for the crypto industry, rather than publish “conflicting statements” and other non-binding forms of guidance in September. It’s a statement we’ve heard before.

42432954,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2Qdh,1603296354,Privacy Coin Zcash Makes Its Ethereum ‘Wrapped’ Debut With Tokensoft and Anchorage,"Remember when crypto exchanges were strong-armed into delisting privacy coins like zcash (ZEC) in order to protect their brittle banking covenants?      But crypto keeps moving, and today ZEC is making its debut within the bustling decentralized exchange (DEX) ecosystem in the form of wrapped zcash (WZEC). Announced Wednesday, WZEC is the first asset to be launched by “Wrapped,” a partnership between Ethereum tokenizers Tokensoft and qualified custodian Anchorage, with over-the-counter (OTC) liquidity provided by CMS Holdings.      Wrapping is the act of taking a blockchain asset like bitcoin and issuing an equivalent representation on another blockchain such as Ethereum. Wrapped bitcoin (WBTC), for instance, is an ERC-20 token that’s backed on a 1:1 basis with bitcoin held in reserve by qualified custodian BitGo Trust.      In a similar fashion, wrapped zcash is a 1:1 representation of zcash on Ethereum held in custody by Anchorage. Wrapped tokens provide a big shot of liquidity to DEXs and offer otherwise staid assets the ability to frolic in the wilds of decentralized finance (DeFi).      Read more: Wrapped Bitcoin Sees Record $57.1M in Tokens Minted by CoinList for Customers      “I’m thrilled that there is such interest, and that people can, and do, innovate and deploy extensions on top of Zcash without the Electric Coin Company’s knowledge or approval,” Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn, Zcash founder and Electric Coin Company CEO, told CoinDesk in a direct message.      “I also agree that it’s great for people to have more alternatives to centralized exchanges (CEXs), and the way that CEXs have to comply with arbitrary demands from their banks,” he added.    Tokenized ZEC    Today, zcash can be used in either of two ways: transparent or shielded. The shielding of the transacting crypto wallets enables a degree of privacy not found on the public-by-default Bitcoin blockchain, for example. It’s ZEC’s shielding capabilities that make regulators nervous, narrowing the scope somewhat for this clever use of technology.      The wrapped version of zcash on Ethereum “really brings the best of both worlds,” said Mason Borda, CEO of Tokensoft.      “Obviously Zcash enables shielded transactions, so now holders of zcash can have assets in a shielded pool and wrap a portion of these assets to use on Ethereum, maintaining their privacy,” said Borda. “They would love to use their zcash, but they don’t want to disclose how much they have. They just want that information private.”      Wrapping zcash on the Tokensoft platform for use on Ethereum also makes the shielded version of the coins more palatable to regulators, Borda believes. That’s because it involves a know-your-customer (KYC) process performed upstream, he said, plus the ZEC holder also has to meet with Anchorage’s compliance as a qualified custodian.      Read more: Nearly $100M in Bitcoin Moved to Ethereum in July, Led by Retail Traders      “Wrapping the zcash and putting it on the Ethereum rails does open up the door for these jurisdictions to support this asset,” Borda said. “So it’s a big deal. It’s going to open up zcash to every other market out there that is currently concerned about enhanced privacy and shielded transactions.”      But doesn't loading lots of KYC and compliance around zcash defeat the purpose of privacy coins in the first place?      ""The goal with zcash was never to shield from authorities, regulators or your financial providers,"" said Diogo Monica, co-founder and president of Anchorage. ""The shielding of zcash came as a response to the fact that bitcoin is pseudonymous. So who you're shielding from is the public at large and the internet at large. And so the fact that we're using ERC-1404 standard allows us to guarantee on-chain that we have the advantages of regulation with the advantages of zcash on-chain anonymity.""    ZEC lite    Tokensoft developed the ERC-1404 standard for SEC-registered assets on Ethereum, a streamlining system that also involves Anchorage as custodian.      The ERC-1404 is basically a template smart contract with compliance functions baked in, including the whitelisting of investors so regulators know exactly who everyone is.      “There are certain things we’re switching off, but other things we’re leaving on,” Borda said of WZEC’s ERC-1404 debut. “The main difference is that the whitelisting is off, so the tokens are ERC-20 compatible and freely transferable.”      Read more: Regulated US Exchange Gemini Now Offers Confidential Zcash Withdrawals      For its part, Anchorage became a qualified custodian in the state of South Dakota back in July 2019, following crypto custodian BitGo, which got the green light from state regulators in 2018.      “This is what Anchorage was built to do,” said Monica. ""Anchorage was built to use private keys safely for active participation in blockchains. Our technology permits us to have better liquidity, and public auditability of every single asset that we have on the platform. And also our platform allows us to just add more wrapped assets in the near future.”      CMS Holdings, the institutional crypto firm founded by Bobby Cho of Cumberland and former Circle trader Dan Matuszewski, praised the new partnership.      “Wrapped is the best wrapping I’ve ever wrapped with,” Matuszewski quipped via email.",POSITIVE,BTC | ZEC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | ZEC,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/10/21/privacy-coin-zcash-makes-its-ethereum-wrapped-debut-with-tokensoft-and-anchorage,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4d3159036d9986dec3978e1e73620634cb9a081d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

CasperLabs CEO Mrinal Manohar confirmed the private CSPR token presale to CoinDesk and further revealed that Digital Strategies had led the investment, with headline participation from HashKey Capital and Blockchange Ventures, as well as 52 others. Nearly half of subscribers already held CasperLabs equity, he said.      All together, the 55 new CSPR holders wield a share of the Casper network that Manohar said ranges “in the teens.”      Casper’s future node runners lend an early security force to the Swiss-based company’s upcoming blockchain. Jumping on ahead of Casper's mainnet launch, and even before the native token’s public sale, these “genesis validators,” as Manohar called them, will confirm transactions on the smart contract-based network when it goes live early next year.      “Everyone is mandated to be a validator,” said Manohar, adding the sale will “create the initial security of the network” that CasperLabs has no interest in raising alone.      Read more: CasperLabs Pivots Away From Ethereum to Fundraise With Its Own Blockchain      “It’s a completely open and permissionless system,” he said.      CasperLabs is among the many lesser-known blockchain projects hoping to steal even just a sliver of crypto’s decentralized finance (DeFi) scene from Ethereum. Industry tracker DeFi Pulse now estimates that Ethereum blockchain DeFi projects are locking up over $10.6 billion in value.      But with DeFi’s market leader struggling under high fees and long confirmation times – not to mention a long-promised network upgrade looming but hardly assured – Casper’s team is eager to prove that an upstart competitor can handle booming industry demand.      CasperLabs understands Ethereum's scaling woes perhaps better than most. Ethereum Foundation developer Vlad Zamfir used to advise the company. But he'd left the project by March 2020, when CasperLabs said it was pivoting away from Ethereum.      Excitement for Casper’s mainnet launch is running high if the CSPR round’s numbers are any indication. Manohar said the oversubscribed round brought in $4 million more than initially planned. All that cash came from 55 “medium-sized checks,” he said.      Coming one year after CasperLabs’ Series A sale raised $14.5 million, the fresh cash will fuel Casper’s 40 employees through their final pre-launch development, according to Manohar. Twenty-nine of them are engineers. Money’s “always gone very heavily into engineering” he said.      Manohar has no plans to run another private sale before the public offering in “early Q1” 2021. And there’s no need to, he said. The sale’s primary function, now complete, was to establish Casper’s launch-day validators.      Also read: Validators Drop Off Ethereum 2.0 Testnets as Mainnet Release Looms      Next year’s public CSPR sale will give the public (but not U.S. investors) a shot at staging nodes as well.

This summer, the ETC blockchain suffered three such attacks in a month. Soon after, ETC Labs – leading organization supporting the network – announced it would roll out the Modified Exponential Subjective Scoring (MESS) solution as an ""innovative and low-risk"" means to mitigate the risk of future 51% attacks.      But, according to a report from the ETC Cooperative and Cardano developer IOHK on Tuesday, an analysis concluded that ""the ‘MESS' solution will not provide ""robust security"" and there's ""no guarantee that further attacks will not succeed.""      Further, MESS doesn’t provide ""high confidence for stakeholders to reduce confirmation times to desirable levels,"" the report reads.      A 51% attack occurs when a nefarious actor gains the majority of a network's computing power, allowing them to carry out a reorganization (""reorg"") of blocks on the chain and potentially double-spend transactions.      MESS is designed to make large block reorgs up to 31 times more costly, in theory negating any profit motive behind 51% attacks.      The firms looked at various solutions proposed by developer teams from across the ETC community for the analysis, and said checkpointing and timestamping solutions would provide superior security.    The alternatives    According to the report, timestamping enables ETC to base its security off another secure blockchain such as Bitcoin.      Meanwhile, checkpointing occurs when a ""trusted authority"" chooses a block to become the canonical chain all participants must follow, and cannot be later ""dropped or reverted.""      ETC Co-op Executive Director Bob Summerwill said he hoped the report was the ""first step"" toward decentralized decision making among ETC's leadership, ""allowing technical and other ecosystem proposals to be essentially peer-reviewed, improving them, and ensuring they are sound.""      The report also suggested the implementation of a ""decentralized treasury,"" providing an ongoing source of funding for the future development of the ETC platform.      ""A democratic and transparent funding mechanism will also allow the ETC community to determine its future direction by allowing it to choose which innovations are incorporated into the ETC product offering,"" it reads.      This, the report claimed, would ultimately allow ETC to ""keep pace with and exceed the capabilities of other platforms.""

42432960,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2Qnh,1603285253,New York Lawyers Propose Toolkit for Keeping 'Decentralized' Blockchains Honest,"A New York law firm is trying to test blockchain projects’ decentralization claims against their perhaps not-quite-so-distributed realities.      Called the “Ketsal Open Standards” rubric, the toolkit, developed by the Ketsal law firm and revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, proposes using hard, measurable data points to either bolster or burst a blockchain’s decentralized credentials.      It’s the latest contribution to a long-raging debate in crypto: when, and how, is something truly decentralized?      Finding that key, said toolkit co-creator and Ketsal partner Josh Garcia, can help investors, security researchers and even securities regulators root out blockchain projects’ sometimes bogus claims.      “It’s a tool to push along an informed discussion on what you’re talking about when you’re saying, ‘my network is decentralized.’""      ""Now you can push back” with evidence the assertion is demonstrably false, he said.      Garcia and co-author Jenny Leung's Open Standards is hardly the first decentralization measurement toolkit. But a review by CoinDesk shows it to be one of the most robust.      See also: To Get Serious About Decentralization, We Need to Measure It      Thirty-three data points probe the hard facts behind blockchain decentralization. Many are obvious. For example, the focus network’s node count – a decentralized network should have plenty – and its underlying code’s licensure status – open source or bust – are clear benchmarks.      But others appear to be more novel. Ketsal’s framework proposes weighing the network’s GitHub statistics, measuring inter-node communication times, determining how large a stake of the cryptocurrency rests in wallets (and with the big-investing whales) – and even the theoretical cost of attacking the market price of a cryptocurrency, among others.      Compiling these statistics can help researchers better understand a blockchain’s in-the-moment distribution even if reaching an up-down verdict on its decentralization is impossible, said Garcia.      “It’s not an answer to the question, ‘What is decentralization,’ but it's a way to find that answer,” he said. “If people can decide whether or not some of these metrics are valid,” they can use their chosen set to test for the type of decentralization they’re looking at.      Providing a broad selection of diverse metrics is critical, he said, because of the political, computational and economic analysts searching for a “decentralization” particular to them. A securities regulator concerned with the Howey Test would likely choose different data points than a security researcher probing the network for holes.      Read more: Coinbase-Led Crypto Ratings Council Plans Transparency Boost as New Members Join      But different analysts also might hone in on similar points. For one, mining power concentration, or the concentration of miners whose computational efforts cryptographically secure proof-of-work blockchains, is a critical benchmark for any decentralization hawk.      If all the key miners are geographically concentrated or grouped into a single pool, a blockchain may face mounting centralization and security risks, according to Ketsal. Just four pools mined 58% of Bitcoin blocks in the past year, the rubric shows.      Garcia said his team spent months compiling all the relevant data points from the world’s best-known blockchain network. Bitcoin’s resilience as well as the consensus agreement that it is decentralized make it an ideal case study, and Garcia said it’s the obvious benchmark to hold other projects against.      “If you do the same exact chart for another blockchain network, and you compare it side by side to Bitcoin … you know how far off you are from [decentralization]” he said.

42432972,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2RBh,1603284865,"First Mover: PayPal Rushes In and Bitcoin Breaches $12K, While USDC Gains on Tether","Bitcoin blew past $12,000 to its highest price in two months, bringing into view the prospect of a fresh 2020 high.      The largest cryptocurrency was changing hands Wednesday around $12,200, within striking distance of the year's high around $12,500. And that was even before the news emerged that electronic consumer payments giant PayPal had been granted a conditional New York state license for a partnership to buy and sell cryptocurrencies.      ""Coupled with a seemingly constant flow of reports of traditional funds and companies investing or allocating some of their balance sheet to Bitcoin, we were due for a move up,"" Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the publicly traded digital-asset firm Diginex, told subscribers in his daily newsletter.      In traditional markets, European equity indexes were lower, U.S. stock futures fluctuated and 10-year Treasury yields rose on renewed speculation that lawmakers in Washington might still be moving toward a stimulus package. Gold rose 0.6% to $1,919 an ounce.    Market moves    While tether (USDT), with a market cap surpassing $16 billion, continues to hold the lion’s share of stablecoins in circulation, two smaller rivals are trouncing it in crypto’s hottest market this year, decentralized finance (DeFi).      Measured by the total value locked in six of the most popular DeFi protocols – Compound, Maker, Uniswap, Curve, Aave and Balancer – USD coin (USDC) is in the lead among stablecoins followed by dai (DAI), the native stablecoin to MakerDAO. That’s according to data compiled by Flipside Crypto as of Oct. 19.      USDC and DAI have market caps of $2.74 billion and $608 million, respectively. Yet, unlike on centralized exchanges, where tether is the go-to stablecoin in dollar-based crypto trades, USDC and DAI seem to have found their niche as the preferred stablecoins in decentralized trades.      In an interview with CoinDesk, Jeremy Allaire, peer-to-peer payments company Circle’s co-founder, attributed USDC’s success in DeFi to his company’s early efforts in building relationships with the DeFi communities. The fact the two companies that co-founded USDC’s governing Centre consortium, Circle and crypto exchange Coinbase, are both registered financial entities in the United States may also have something to do with USDC’s recent upturn. According to Allaire, USDC is preferred by institutional investors for being “safe, trusted and regulated.”      Authorities around the globe are giving more direction on how cryptocurrencies should be used and regulated. In late September, for instance, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) published its first regulatory guidance for stablecoins, clarifying that national banks can provide services to stablecoin issuers in the U.S.      “Having guidelines creates more certainty, which makes mainstream market participants ready and willing to engage in it,” Allaire told CoinDesk.      - Muyao Shen      Read More: Tether Still Dominates Stablecoins, but USDC and Dai Are Winning DeFi    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin's price has jumped to two-month highs, and data from the options market shows traders are positioning for a continued rally.      The top cryptocurrency by market value rose to $12,303 early today – the highest level since Aug. 18 – and was last seen trading near $12,250, representing a 2% gain on the day.      The market sentiment has turned quite bullish, with firms like Square, Microstrategy and Stone Ridge disclosing their bitcoin holdings and bolstering the digital asset's popularity as a store of value.      ""The momentum is certainly picking up with support from large corporations buying into the market,"" Wayne Chen, CEO, and director of Interlapse Technologies, told CoinDesk in a LinkedIn chat.      The move above $12,000 has exposed the August high of $12,476, above which significant resistance is seen directly at $13,880 (June 2019 high).      Options market data shows investors are expecting a continued price rally. ""Bitcoin is breaking out, and the options market is preparing for a bigger rally,"" Skew's CEO Emmanuel Goh told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.      The bullish mood is evident from the negative one-, three-, and six-month put-call skews, which measure the cost of puts relative to calls.      In other words, calls or bullish bets are drawing higher prices than puts or bearish bets – a sign of investors positioning for a price rally.      - Omkar Godbole    Token watch    Ether (ETH): Validators of Ethereum blockchain's drop off of test network as more developers say they're ready for first phase of 2.0 upgrade.

42432967,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO2R5h,1603281616,"PayPal Embraces Crypto, Igniting Market as Mainstream Adoption Inches Closer","Crypto just got a shot at going mainstream in 2021.      PayPal officially confirmed Wednesday it is entering the cryptocurrency market. The payments giant, with 346 million active accounts around the world, pledged to make cryptocurrency “a funding source for purchases at its 26 million merchants worldwide.”    What we know:  PayPal said buy, sell and hold features would be live within the next few weeks but for some users, the features are already available.  PayPal's service does not allow bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to be withdrawn or deposited. Once you buy the coins, they stay in your account until you sell.  Initially, the service supports bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH) and litecoin (LTC).  This is a developing story; stay tuned for updates with full coverage below.    Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies rallied following the announcement, which is one of several recent signs this year of mainstream corporate adoption of the decade-old technology, following MicroStrategy's $425 million deployment of its cash surplus into bitcoin and a similar but more modest move by Square.      CoinDesk first reported PayPal was planning a move into crypto in June, citing anonymous sources. A month later, CoinDesk reported the Paxos exchange had been selected to support PayPal in its crypto endeavors.      In a blog post Wednesday, PayPal said the COVID-19 pandemic had driven the need for digital payments of all sorts, although the move had been in planning since at least late last year, and following PayPal’s short-lived dalliance with the Facebook-spawned Libra project.      Beginning in early 2021, PayPal customers will be able to instantly convert their selected cryptocurrency balance to fiat currency, with certainty of value and no incremental fees, PayPal said. Its merchants will have no additional integrations or fees, as all transactions will be settled with fiat currency at their current PayPal rates.      “In effect, cryptocurrency simply becomes another funding source inside the PayPal digital wallet, adding enhanced utility to cryptocurrency holders, while addressing previous concerns surrounding volatility, cost and speed of cryptocurrency-based transactions,” PayPal said.    Not your keys...    As bullish for the bitcoin market as this announcement has proven to be, an initial review of PayPal’s crypto services terms underscores that a go-it-slow mindset still pervades. Critical caps limit who buyers are, how much they can buy and what they can actually do with their PayPal-sourced crypto.      For starters, PayPal is refusing to hand over customers’ keys.      “You own the Cryptocurrency you buy on PayPal but will not be provided with a private key,” PayPal wrote in a help post. PayPal casts the restriction as a loss-prevention tactic.      A customer losing private keys makes his or her underlying crypto pretty much gone for good, the post points out. While users will not be liable for “unauthorized” crypto transactions on their account (think: hacks), PayPal appears to have no interest in mitigating sloppy private key management.      But keeping keys away from customers ensures PayPal can maintain a tighter grip on how customers wield BTC, BCH, LTC and ETH.      Crucially, users will not be allowed to send their crypto around.      “You can only hold the Cryptocurrency that you buy on PayPal in your account. Additionally, the Cryptocurrency in your account cannot be transferred to other accounts on or off PayPal,” the help page says.      This prompted the inevitable Eagles ""Hotel California"" song reference (""You can check out anytime you like/but you can never leave"") on crypto Twitter:      The service rollout also faces a series of real-world restrictions. Only 49 out of 50 U.S. states have coverage at launch, with Hawaii, a notoriously tricky state for crypto companies, excluded from the list.      “We plan to expand this service to select global markets in the first half of 2021,” PayPal said.      There’s also a $10,000 weekly buying cap and a $50,000 limit per 12-month period. All trades must be executed in U.S. dollars, PayPal said.    PayPal gets BitLicense    As part of Wednesday's formalities, the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS), said it had granted the first “conditional BitLicense” to PayPal for a partnership with Paxos Trust Company, enabling customers to buy and sell cryptocurrencies.      DFS said it was making good on a promise last year from Superintendent of Financial Services Linda A. Lacewell to take a fresh look at its regulatory framework for virtual currencies, with a view to fostering innovation in New York State.      “DFS’s approval today follows our June 2020 announcement for a new framework for a conditional Bitlicense to encourage, promote and assist interested institutions to have a well-regulated way to access the New York virtual currency marketplace in a way that is both timely and protective of New York consumers, through partnerships with New York authorized virtual currency firms,” said Lacewell in a statement.      “DFS will continue to encourage and support financial service providers to operate, grow, remain and expand in New York and work with innovators to enable them to germinate and test their ideas, for a dynamic and forward-looking financial services sector, especially as we work to build New York back better in the midst of this pandemic,"" she said.      Now, with the DFS’s approval, New York State-chartered Paxos will be able to provide trading and custodial services to PayPal to allow the fintech giant’s 346 million customers to buy, sell and hold bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether and litecoin, according to the DFS statement.      Since 2015, DFS has approved 26 entities to engage in virtual currency business in New York State, including PayPal.

42405264,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLkjy,1603274460,"Ban All Ransomware Payments, in Bitcoin or Otherwise","We all know it's illegal to kidnap someone and ask for a ransom payment. But should it also be illegal for the victim to pay the ransom?      Earlier this month the U.S. Treasury Department did just that. It notified the world that certain ransom payments are illegal, specifically those to sanctioned ransomware operators. Should a victim pay a ransom to a sanctioned entity, that person may face a big fine.    J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog.    Punishing ransom victims seems heartless. But it may be one of the best ways to protect the public from extortionists. And if it wants to make a serious dent in the growing ransomware market, the Treasury Department will have to go much further than putting a few entities on its sanctions list.      On Oct. 1, the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) published a notice reminding everyone that several ransomware operators have been put on OFAC's list of sanctioned entities, otherwise known as its Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List. The agency's letter clarifies that should a victim make a ransom payment to an OFAC-sanctioned ransomware operator, that person could be breaking the law.    The ransomware wave    Ransomware is malicious software that blocks access to a computer system by encrypting data. Once the data is locked, the ransomware operator demands the victim pay a ransom in exchange for a decryption key.      The emergence of bitcoin, a digital, uncensorable asset, has made it particularly easy for ransomware operators to profit from their attacks. The earliest bitcoin ransomware strains targeted regular consumers with $300 or $400 ransoms. In 2019, operators like Sodinokibi, Netwalker and REvil began to move on to attacking corporations, municipal governments, school boards and hospitals.      See also: JP Koning - Bitcoin’s Ransomware Problem Won’t Go Away      The ransoms have gotten much larger. This summer, the University of Utah paid $457,059 in bitcoin for a decryption key. CWT, a travel company, paid $4.5 million to Ragnar Locker ransomware operators in July. The list of victims grows longer by the hour.      The damage involves more than just the ransom fee. Many organizations bravely refuse to give in to the ransomware operator's demands. Rebuilding their network often costs more than the actual ransom payment. The crippled system will likely remain down for days, even weeks. The Government of Nunavut, a Canadian territory, couldn't serve citizens for almost a month after it refused to pay Dopplemayer ransomware operators.    A collective action problem    Society’s response to ransomware is an example of a collective action problem. The public would be better off if everyone cooperated and refused to pay money to ransomware operators. With no incoming ransom income, the ransomware business would be unprofitable, attacks would cease and the collateral damage would stop.      Unfortunately, spontaneous cooperation between thousands of corporations, governments, and nonprofits is difficult to achieve. Any attempt to boycott ransom payments must rely on appeals to solidarity. But organizations will face pressure from shareholders or citizens to recover as quickly as possible, and so they will secretly pay. If 10% or 20% of victims defect from the boycott and pay the ransom, then the ransomware industry will be profitable and so everyone suffers as the blight continues.    Banning ransomware payments may not be the perfect option for stopping the growing ransomware wave, but it may be the best option we’ve got.    One way to fix the collective action problem is for the government to help push the public towards the best solution. The government can do this by declaring ransom payments illegal, and setting a penalty for rule breakers. The punishment for breaking the law would be a $20 million fine, or something like that.      Now when a ransomware operator attacks, all the victims cooperate by default. ""No, we can't pay you. If we do, we'll have to pay an even larger fee to the government."" Ransom payments will stop, ransomware operators will cease their attacks and the damage ends.    The market for bribes as an analogy    Using the government to arrive at the best solution to a collective action problem isn't without precedent. Another type of shady payment, the payment of bribes, provides a useful analogy.      If companies must habitually bribe foreign government officials for contracts, then that drives up the costs of doing business. The public would be better off if everyone refused to pay a bribe. But cooperation is difficult.      Until the 1970s and 80s, foreign bribes were valid tax deductions in many countries. But efforts like the U.S.'s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCAP) made it unlawful to bribe foreign government officials. Multinationals can now push back against bribery requests by pointing to FCAP. This helps push society arrive at the no-bribe solution.      The U.S. Treasury's recent clarification about the illegality of certain ransom payments only goes part of the way. It prohibits payments to a few bad actors, but there are many ransomware operators that do not appear on OFAC's SDN list. To help solve the collective action problem, OFAC would have to be more proactive in designating ransomware operators.      See also: G7 Warns of Crypto Threat From Tidal Wave of Ransomware Attacks      Sussing out the names and identities of all the producers and distributors of ransomware seems like an impossible task, however. It would be much easier to declare a blanket ban on all ransomware payments, just as how FCAP bans bribery. Ransom bans aren't without precedent. In response to a wave of kidnappings by organized crime, Italy prohibited ransom payments in 1991. Colombia and Switzerland have also made ransom payments illegal. The Group of Seven has a long-standing policy of refusing to pay ransoms for hostages of terrorist groups.      The knock against prohibiting either bribes or ransom payments is that it forces the market to become more opaque. If it is legal to make a bribe, then the bribe payer can report the bribe taker. This serves to limit the market for bribes. Ban bribes and the bribe payer is incentivized to cooperate with the bribe taker to keep things secret.      This is why Kaushik Basu, the former chief economist at the World Bank, has long advocated for legalizing bribe payments.      As for ransomware, victims who pay a ransom can report the attack to law enforcement agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation without fearing a fine. This allows the FBI to follow up. But if it is illegal to pay a ransom, then victims that choose to pay will keep their actions a secret. Lacking accurate data, the FBI will do a poorer job of defending against ransomware.      The other knock against banning ransomware payments is the perceived inhumanity of it. Try telling a mother or father that it is illegal for them to pay a ransom to free their kidnapped child. The same goes for ransomware. A school board that has been crippled by ransomware can immediately resume classes by paying a $20,000 bitcoin ransom. But under a prohibition, children may have to go a week or two without classes as the school board rebuilds its systems.      There are also civil liberties concerns. Businesses will argue that a ban on ransoms infringes on their ability to control their property.    Bitcoin isn’t Green Dot    When extortionists find profitable ways to bilk the public, one way to fight them is to make changes to the underlying payments platform that the scammers are using. Internal Revenue Service scammers converged on Green Dot MoneyPak cards in the mid 2010s as a useful way to extort innocent Americans. The chosen solution wasn't to tell victims that paying ransom was illegal. Rather, Green Dot Bank pulled the product for a year and reprogrammed it. And it worked. Criminals have moved on from using MoneyPaks to do IRS scams.      Unlike MoneyPaks, bitcoin can't be reprogrammed. That leaves society with one less option for protecting itself from ransomware attacks. And so the ""no payment"" solution to the collective action problem beckons. Banning ransomware payments may not be the perfect option for stopping the growing ransomware wave, but it may be the best option we’ve got.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/10/21/ban-all-ransomware-payments-in-bitcoin-or-otherwise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/54b0802b015561dee660a3ed58347caa17afd062-1500x1122.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405285,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLl0h,1603270800,"Tether Still Dominates Stablecoins, but USDC and Dai Are Winning DeFi","While tether (USDT), with a market cap surpassing $16 billion, continues to hold the lion’s share of stablecoins in circulation, two smaller rivals are trouncing it in crypto’s hottest market this year, decentralized finance (DeFi).      Measured by the total value locked in six of the most popular DeFi protocols – Compound, Maker, Uniswap, Curve, Aave and Balancer – USD coin (USDC) is in the lead among stablecoins followed by dai (DAI), the native stablecoin to MakerDAO. That’s according to data compiled by Flipside Crypto as of Oct. 19.      USDC and DAI have market caps of $2.74 billion and $608 million, respectively. Yet, unlike on centralized exchanges, where tether is the go-to stablecoin in dollar-based crypto trades, USDC and DAI seem to have found their niche as the preferred stablecoins in decentralized trades.      In an interview with CoinDesk, Jeremy Allaire, peer-to-peer payments company Circle’s co-founder, attributed USDC’s success in DeFi to his company’s early efforts in building relationships with the DeFi communities. The fact the two companies that co-founded USDC's governing Centre consortium, Circle and crypto exchange Coinbase, are both registered financial entities in the United States may also have something to do with USDC's recent upturn. According to Allaire, USDC is preferred by institutional investors for being “safe, trusted and regulated.”      Read more: Total Stablecoin Supply Nearly Doubled in Q3, Adding Record $8B      Authorities around the globe are giving more direction on how cryptocurrencies should be used and regulated. In late September, for instance, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) published its first regulatory guidance for stablecoins, clarifying that national banks can provide services to stablecoin issuers in the U.S.      “Having guidelines creates more certainty, which makes mainstream market participants ready and willing to engage in it,” Allaire told CoinDesk.      In contrast to USDC, dai is a decentralized stablecoin that in theory does not have a centralized issuer and is censorship-resistant. Niklas Kunkel, the head of backend services at MakerDAO, told CoinDesk DAI's decentralization core has made it more popular than most of its competitors. He sees its decentralization as a good thing for regulators.      “One advantage you have from a decentralized stablecoin is that everything is completely transparent,” Kunkel told CoinDesk in an interview. “So from a regulatory point of view, this is almost like their dream scenario, right? Because they can see exactly how many dai are in existence and in circulation and they can see in real time.”      “Dai is not the antithesis to regulation and regulator,” he added. “If anything, it's the opposite.”      For stablecoin king tether, more than a few market participants question whether it is as transparent as the company claims. Tether the company has been battling multiple lawsuits accusing it of not properly backing its currency with collateralized reserves. Tether has declined to answer CoinDesk’s questions on the lawsuits. However, in an email, Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino called tether “the most stable and liquid stablecoin.”      That assertion is challenged by at least some of its competitors.      Read more: ‘No Other Option but More Collateral’: The Short- (and Long-) Term Fixes for Dai’s Broken Peg      “Tether is not fully backed with dollars and there is very little transparency into their reserves,” the head of strategy at Paxos, Walter Hessert, wrote in an email response to CoinDesk. “That’s ok for some crypto traders because there are very liquid markets today. However, mainstream investors and institutions prefer stablecoins they can trust.”      According to Tether’s website, its USDT stablecoin is backed by cash and equivalents “and, from time to time, may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities.”      Paxos’ stable of stablecoins, including Paxos standard token (PAX), Binance USD (BUSD) and Huobi (HUSD), are all approved by regulators and are fully backed on a one-to-one basis with U.S. dollars, according to Hessert.      Tether’s first-mover advantage may have been the leading reason for its overall dominance, but even in Asia, which has historically driven demand in USDT, traders are beginning to turn to other stablecoins for liquidity.      “We have seen a lot of guys in Asia are starting to trade more BUSD and USDC instead of tether,” Darius Sit, co-founder of Singapore-based crypto trading firm QCP Capital, told CoinDesk in an interview. “USDC is more fungible, meaning that it can be exchanged one to one anytime. The spread is tighter.”      The total stablecoin supply in the third quarter nearly doubled from the second quarter, and the total market capitalization of stablecoins has also breached $20 billion at press time, according to data from CoinGecko. That’s still relatively smaller than what’s found in traditional finance, a fact giving optimism to many in the stablecoin business hoping to overtake tether.      “When you think about the size of dollar money markets, it’s like four trillion"" dollars, Allaire said. “So clearly, tokenized dollars that are used in a really wide variety of applications should be eventually [worth] hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars.”",NEUTRAL,USDT | DAI | USDC,EXCHANGE | MARKET | USDT | DAI | USDC,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/21/tether-still-dominates-stablecoins-but-usdc-and-dai-are-winning-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8a8c52b996759099c1e496bcfafbeb22097e711f-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42405275,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLkun,1603270277,Central Bank of Bahamas Launches Landmark 'Sand Dollar' Digital Currency,"The Central Bank of the Bahamas has officially launched its national digital currency.      The first of its kind in the world to have been fully deployed, the sand dollar is a digital version of the Bahamian dollar.      Issued by the country's monetary authority as a central bank digital currency (CBDC), the announcement of the launch came via a tweet on Wednesday.      The project is designed to bring more ""inclusive access to regulated payments and other financial services,"" per the central bank's FAQ.      CBDCs have been a hot topic this year; China, for instance, appears to be close to launching its digital yuan, which in recent days has seen its biggest public trial. Others, like the U.S., Russia and the European Union are looking into their respective CBDC launches.      As reported by CoinDesk, the first phase of the Bahamas rollout sees private-sector players such as banks and credit unions readying compliance checks for personal and enterprise wallets to support the sand dollar.      The digital wallets will be secured with multi-factor authentication security and will be mobile-based, servicing the 90% of the population with smartphones.      Underserved communities of the Caribbean nation are the primary target of the initiative, which the bank said would reduce financial service delivery costs and boost transactional efficiency. The country is an archipelago with hundreds of islands, placing limits on traditional infrastructure.      The Sand Dollar is backed 1:1 to the Bahamian dollar (BSD), which, in turn, is pegged to the U.S. dollar.

42405269,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeLkot,1603244449,"Futures Traders Aren't as Bullish This Time Around as Bitcoin Price Revisits $12,000, Data Indicates","Cryptocurrency traders showed significantly less enthusiasm as bitcoin traded at $12,000 Tuesday compared to when bitcoin reached the same level nearly two months ago, based on futures funding rates from multiple exchanges.    When bitcoin traded near $12,000 throughout August, finally reaching the key level mid-month, funding rates for perpetual futures turned acutely positive across leading derivative exchanges, reflecting the market's bullishness.  As bitcoin revisited $12,000 Tuesday, however, funding rates reacted differently, staying flat or turning negative, indicating a lack of the same bullishness two months ago.  A mechanism unique to perpetual futures contracts, funding rates are set by the market and vary over time as traders put on and take off positions. When the market is bullish, funding rates turn positive, and traders taking long positions pay short sellers. When the market is bearish, funding turns negative, and short sellers pay.  Funding rates across Binance, Bitfinex, BitMEX, and Deribit futures markets started turning negative Saturday and Sunday as bitcoin started trading above the low $11,000 levels, according to data aggregated by Glassnode. As bitcoin tapped $12,000 Tuesday, rates stayed negative or went flat.  A string of negative news over the past few weeks may be to blame for the market's less-than-bullish sentiment, according to Aditya Das, cryptocurrency market analyst at Brave New Coin, who said he thinks some traders may have been ""spooked"" and closed their long positions or put on shorts.  Funding on FTX and Huobi similarly stayed negative throughout the week's entire opening rally, according to data aggregated by Skew.  Futures traders on OKEx, the largest derivatives exchange by open interest, in fact became increasingly bearish Tuesday amid bitcoin’s rally. The exchange’s ratio of long to short positions steadily dropped from 0.79 at Tuesday’s open to 0.67 at last check, as short sellers outnumbered bitcoin bulls.  Despite the lack of bullishness from futures traders, traditional market asset allocators and crypto-market investors are still actively ""redenominating"" into bitcoin, according to Kyle Davies, co-founder of Three Arrows Capital, continuing what he calls ""the story of Q3 2020.""

Stronger identity verification requirements is an industry trend, said Ben Radclyffe, commercial director of the exchange's parent company 100x Group, in an interview with CoinDesk. BitMEX’s decision to move the deadline from February 2021 to November 2020 follows this trend and internal plans the exchange has worked on for “over a year with a considerable amount of resources dedicated to this.”      In August, the famously freewheeling bitcoin derivatives exchange announced mandatory identity verification. Less than two months later, charges were filed against the exchange by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC); after that, nearly 30% of its bitcoin balance was withdrawn by clients.      Under the accelerated timeline, by 0:00 UTC on Nov. 5, all BitMEX traders and affiliates identities must be verified before increasing or opening new positions. By Dec. 4., all accounts must be verified in order to process withdrawals from the exchange.      After Dec. 4, BitMEX will begin to review remaining open positions on unverified accounts and communicate the account holders, Radclyffe told CoinDesk. Funds will be recoverable and eligible for normal withdrawals post verification.      “Well over 50% of BitMEX’s current trading volume comes from verified accounts,” said Radclyffe, representing the trading activity of tens of thousands of accounts.      “The industry’s KYC-free days are coming to a close,” said 100x's chief compliance officer, Malcolm Wright, referring to know-your-customer rules.      BitMEX plans to use its accelerated identity verification program, along with other corporate initiatives and Wright's experience as chair of an anti-money laundering working group at Global Digital Finance, to become an industry leader in identity verification initiatives, Wright said.
