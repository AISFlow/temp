42399263,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbihbp,1470872762,Bitfinex Draws Volume as Traders Test Experimental BFX Tokens,"A market appears to be developing for Bitfinex's newly issued debt tokens.  Distributed this week by the troubled exchange to users who lost funds in last week's $60m hack, the value of the cryptographic tokens rose sharply after the exchange resumed trading today.  The so-called ""BFX tokens"", a debt-based blockchain asset said to be convertible to equity in the Hong Kong-based business, started the day out at $0.10 and rose to as much as $0.40 over the course of the day's session.  This sharp price appreciation proved the most interesting development associated with Bitfinex's widely anticipated reopening, according to analysts.  Arthur Hayes, CEO of leveraged trading platform BitMEX, noted his interest in the strength of the market for the new coin, as others questioned why traders were returning to the exchange at all.  Hayes told CoinDesk:  ""Even though Bitfinex explicitly said it has no obligations to ever pay back a dime to BFX token holders, traders still ascribe a healthy value to the token.""  The exchange revealed 6th August that these tokens would be available for trade until Bitfinex either pays back its account holders or provides them with shares of iFinex, the BVI-based parent company of the exchange.  Bitfinex data reveals that the two currency pairs involving the token – BFX/USD and BFX/BTC – generated far greater trading volume than any other currency pairs between the exchange's reopening at 16:00 UTC and the time of the report.  BitMEX went so far as to launch a new futures contract, BFXQ16, which allows traders to speculate on BFX/USD's price movements with as much as 2.5 times leverage.  In spite of the token's strong price appreciation and robust transaction volume, market responses were mixed. Some emphasized that by issuing the new tokens, Bitfinex was distributing the first debt-based cryptocurrency, which triggered fears that the community was perhaps turning its back on earlier ideals.  Other market observers, including Whaleclub’s director of operations Petar Zivkovkski, voiced concerns that the market was being driven up by Bitfinex staff members as a means to buy back this equity at a lower value.  At press time, no other exchanges had announced support for the digital asset.

42399216,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbierc,1470855945,Bitfinex Offers $3.6 Million Bounty in Bid to Recover Stolen Bitcoin,"Bitfinex is reportedly offering a reward worth up to $3.6m for the recovery of bitcoins stolen from its exchange last week.  The Hong Kong-based startup lost nearly 120,000 BTC in the incident (an amount worth roughly $71m at press time), and now suggests it's willing to offer 5% of these funds (or about 6,000 BTC) as a reward should they be found and returned.  The news came social media today in a post by Bitfinex community director Zane Tackett. In response to a question about the existence of such a program, he stated that a bounty would be awarded to anyone who had information that helped the exchange recover the funds.  Tackett said:  ""[Five percent] of recovery and for information leading to recovery (but no bounty if no recovery); if multiple persons lead to recovery, share pro rata.""  Bitfinex resumed trading earlier today, just over a week after it shut down in the wake of the theft.

42399236,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbif3Q,1470843946,California Scraps Licenses in Proposed Bitcoin Regulation Overhaul,"The state of California is once again moving forward with legislation that would update its money transmitter rules to capture businesses engaged in digital currency activities.  Deemed inactive last September, Assembly Bill 1326 was re-introduced by the legislature this week and has since been read and amended. Given the discussion that surrounded earlier versions of the bill, the update is already being scrutinized, though signs suggest pros and cons remain.  Most notably, the bill no longer proposes to license businesses engaged in financial applications of the technology, but would instead create a new Digital Currency Business Enrollment Program. Lasting five years, the proposed program appears focused on helping the state learn more about the emerging technology.  According to the bill, companies that store, transmit, exchange or issue digital currency qualify as digital currency businesses and would be required to pay a non-refundable $5,000 fee to participate in the program, a cost equal to the New York BitLicense application fee.  In addition, there is a continuing cost of $2,500 annually, and the text proposes giving the program commissioner the authority to impose ""a claim for civil penalties"" of up to $25,000.  The revised text reads:  ""The bill would prohibit a person from engaging in the digital currency business without enrolling in the program and would prohibit the conduct of digital currency business through an unenrolled agent.""  Elsewhere, the bill includes new definitions for digital currency, labelling the technology a ""digital representation of value"".  Concerns raised  Due to certain revisions and vague wordings, the bill text has drawn early critics.  One person who helped consult California's Assembly Banking and Finance Committee leading up to the bill's amendment said that in spite of the softer language, other changes could result in even harsher requirements.  Digital currency lawyer and research director for non-profit Coin Center, Peter Van Valkenburgh, told CoinDesk:  ""We like that it's enrollment, but we don’t like that because there’s such a big penalty, that it's essentially a license — and we don't like that there's so many kinds of companies that could potentially be subject.""  According to Van Valkenburgh, the non-profit advocacy group supports requiring licensing of a business or individual if they are in a ""position of trust"" with their customers. Those who will be required to enroll in this program don’t necessarily qualify, he said.  Van Valkenburgh joins multiple other skeptics in expressing concern over the bill.  Questions of control  Ambiguities in the terms of who would be subject to the bill open up the door for what Van Valkenburgh believes constitutes unnecessary control.  Other examples he was concerned about included the potential inclusion of sidechains and cross-chain atomic swaps under the exchanges category and the definitions of what it means to transmit and custody a digital currency.  In particular, he says that that lack of bonding requirements and specific consumer protections at this early stage, along with the time limit on the measure that would see its provisions expire in January 2021, shows an open-mindedness to the rapidly changing nature of the industry.  ""By not mandating a particular form of consumer protections the enrollment seems to show a certain amount of humility by the regulators,"" said Van Valkenburgh.  Still, he emphasized the change amounted to a ""radical shift"" away from the direction he believed the state was heading.  He concluded:  ""What’s important to keep in mind is that the language we were dealing with last year is almost entirely different than this year. So something major has changed.""  The bill's author, Matthew Dababneh of California's 45th District, was not immediately available for comment.

42399224,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiewX,1470840805,Bitfinex Exchange to Resume Bitcoin Trading Today,"Bitfinex has announced it will resume trading and withdrawals just over a week after it was robbed of more than $60m in bitcoin.  Trading functionality will be reinstated at 16:00 UTC, the exchange said in a new update. All listed currency pairs will be brought online and withdrawals will be enabled for bitcoin, ether, classic ether and USD. Deposits will also be reactivated.  Bitfinex  revealed last week that it lost nearly 120,000 bitcoins, an announcement that sparked broad debate in the digital currency ecosystem and broader mainstream media criticism.  The exchange has said that it is imposing a roughly 36% loss on user balances as a result of the theft.  As part of its recovery, Bitfinex is issuing a token via the Omni protocol. Trading for the token will be activated alongside other trading pairs, with markets being created for USD and BTC. Users in the US will be able to sell their BFX tokens, but not buy additional tokens.  The exchange said it had taken “significant steps” toward improving the state of its security, explaining:  ""We have added additional platform and infrastructure security checks; regenerated all encrypted services, including wallets, security tokens and passwords; moved funds to multisig cold storage; re-evaluated all third-party integrations; performed a comprehensive system audit in order to identify vulnerabilities; and, rebuilt our entire platform on new infrastructure.""  Bitfinex said that it will no longer support deposit addresses created prior to the exchange shutdown, and warned traders to avoid using old addresses when making deposits.

42399222,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiexW,1470834555,15 R3 Members Trial Distributed Ledger Tech for Trade Finance,"Banking consortium R3CEV revealed today that 15 of its members have completed a distributed ledger trial focused on applications in trade finance.  The test reportedly focused on how its distributed ledger platform Corda could be used in accounts receivable invoicing and letter-of-credit (LC) transactions. Further, it follows news that Bank of America, HSBC and the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore completed a similar trial today using software created by the Linux-led Hyperledger project.  In statements, CEO David Rutter cited the announcement as evidence of the power of the startup's distributed ledger platform Corda.  Rutter said:  ""These trials have proved that the blockchain-inspired technology used on our Corda platform holds the key to transforming trade financing for modern financial markets.""  Barclays, BBVA, BNP Paribas, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Danske Bank, ING Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, Natixis, Nordea, Scotiabank, UBS, UniCredit, US Bank and Wells Fargo were said to have been involved in the effort.

42399231,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbif2R,1470831785,"Bank of America, HSBC Unveil Blockchain Supply Chain Project","Banking giants Bank of America and HSBC have teamed up with the Singapore government’s IT and telecom agency on a project that applies blockchain to trade finance.  Announced today  , Bank of America, HSBC and the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) revealed they have built a blockchain application based on the Hyperledger protocol that aims to replicate the letter of credit (LC) transaction process between banks, exporters and importers.  The trial finds the financial firms seeking to explore how a distributed ledger could establish trust between parties that today need to rely on banks to issue and recognize paper documents as a means of facilitating trade.  According to International Business Times, the proof-of-concept involves a seven-step process that showcases how a distributed-ledger system can be used for data authentication.  In statements, HSBC lauded the experiment as an “exciting” step that validates how the technology could come to be used more widely.  ""Many people are talking about the theory of blockchain, but for the first time we can start to see how this technology might be used to solve the real world challenges our customers face,"" Vive Ramachandran, global head of product for HSBC’s trade finance business, said.  The trial is one of a number to be launched with a focus on supply chain and trade finance in recent months. Notably, both Bank of America and IDA have previously been reported to have been working on similar projects.  For a detailed overview of this use case, read our full research report here.

42399223,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbievY,1470829677,"Bitcoin Sales Are Currency Transactions, Russia's Tax Office Says","Russia's tax agency is encouraging its citizens to report the purchase or sale of digital currencies as currency transactions.  In a tax letter obtained by CoinDesk dated this May, the Ministry of Finance's Federal Tax Service responded to an electronic query on the subject in which it issued new guidance. The statements come amid larger debates domestically about whether bitcoin and other digital currencies should be banned entirely or allowed for specific uses.  The letter includes language describing how the agency treats the purchase and sale of digital currencies between Russia citizens and non-citizens as currency transactions.  A translated copy of the letter states:  ""Consequently, the transactions of purchase and sale of cryptocurrency (virtual currency) between residents and non-residents, with the utilization of currency valuables and (or) currency of the Russian Federation, are, in fact, currency transactions.""  The letter is notable given how the exact definition of a digital currency remains largely in flux globally.  While in some countries units of blockchain-based code are considered a form of payment instrument, some US agencies consider it a commodity or form of property.  The letter goes on to stipulate that Russian citizens are required to report any currency movements to or from a bank outside of the country to local tax agencies.  It further predates comments from deputy finance minister Alexei Moiseev, who in an interview last month said that the Russian Ministry of Finance is becoming supportive of the idea of amending proposed legislation to allow for the use of digital currency as a kind of foreign currency.  ""We are formulating the law in such a way in order to allow buying cryptocurrencies for foreign operations and allow Russian citizens to sell bitcoins for profit reasons in foreign countries,"" he told state-owned newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
