Will Elon Musk Buyout Twitter? The large buy by co-founder and CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk, seems to follow a recent Twitter poll made by himself where users expressed disconformity with the platform. &apos;Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle? The consequences of this poll will be important. Please vote carefully,&apos; Musk&apos;s poll read, and over 70% of users responded &apos;No&apos;. Although he is very popular on the social media network, Musk has been an open critic of Twitter for a while now. He has flirted with the possibility of building his own platform. Now, he owns a stake four times bigger than the shares held by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. Many expect this move to mean that Musk will be pushing a plan to adjust Twitter closer to his beliefs and lead to a buyout. Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, commented to The Guardian: &apos;We would expect this passive stake as just the start of broader conversations with the Twitter board/management that could ultimately lead to an active stake and a potential more aggressive ownership role of Twitter.&apos; Musk&apos;s buy was re...",POSITIVE,DOGE,DOGE | EXCHANGE,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-soared-after-elon-musk-bought-9-2-of-twitter/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

The company attributed the delay to a longer-than-expected permitting process for the required power for its operations.  ‚ÄúTypically, power flows from power stations into the grid. However, to ensure we have a consistent power supply when the renewable sources are operating intermittently, we also needed power to flow from the grid back into the power station at scale,‚Äù said Marathon CEO Fred Thiel, noting that this process required permitting, which delayed the deployment.

However, Thiel said the ‚Äúdelays are now behind us‚Äù and expects to reach 23.3 EH/s by early next year.

The Significance of April 5,"The creator of Bitcoin (BTC), Satoshi Nakamoto, has always remained anonymous, and so you may rightfully wonder how people can celebrate the founder's birthday. The answer is that Nakamoto entered their birthday as April 5 at the time he, she or they registered the famous pseudonym with P2PFoundation.ning.com. The P2P Foundation was one of the internet forums where Satoshi first announced the invention of Bitcoin.  Read more: Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?  Given that the name was fake, people suspect the birthday is made up, too. But they have also noticed that April 5 is a very significant date in U.S. monetary history: It is the anniversary of Executive Order 6102 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933. The order outlawed the private ownership or ""hoarding"" of gold coin, bullion and certificates. People were allowed small amounts valued under $100 at the time, for use in industrial trades, or a few other exceptions.  The order required Americans to hand over any significant amount of gold to the Federal Reserve in exchange for dollars. FDR then devalued those dollars to make it easier to repay the huge debt that had built up during the Great Depression.  While that may have helped the country to escape a difficult situation, some have seen Executive Order 6102 as a challenge to the liberty of individuals to preserve their wealth in the form of gold.  We can‚Äôt know for sure that Satoshi picked April 5 as their birthday for that reason, but we do know that Bitcoin‚Äôs creator was interested in monetary history and concerned about the power of individuals to preserve their wealth and keep it safe from state intervention. It remains a core motivator of Bitcoin‚Äôs supporters to this day. Bitcoin‚Äôs value proposition is often called ""digital gold.""  In another likely allusion to the history of U.S. private gold ownership, Satoshi listed their birth year as 1975. On the final day of 1974, President Gerald Ford's reversal of Executive Order 6102 went into effect, making it legal to own as much gold as you wanted as the revelers rang in the new year of 1975.  Or maybe Satoshi really was born on April 5, 1975.

Bienvenu joined Pantera in April 2021 as digital asset prices rallied and crypto-specific venture capital funds launched with new record sizes. Aset prices pulled back at the beginning of 2022, but that had little impact on VC investments.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not slowing down at all,‚Äù said Bienvenu. ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a good case study here. If you look at the crazy returns we posted over the past two years, those kinds of returns only come from deploying in a bear market.‚Äù  This article is part of¬†Road to Consensus, a series highlighting speakers and the big ideas they will discuss at¬†Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas.¬†Learn more.  Pantera‚Äôs role  Founded in 2003 by Tiger Management alum Dan Morehead, Pantera Capital started as a global hedge fund before making the switch to digital assets a decade later. Portfolio companies have included payments company Circle and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), among many others. The firm had experienced over a year of ‚Äúhyper growth‚Äù at the time Bienvenu joined in 2021, she said.  Bienvenu initially served as chief of staff for Pantera Co-Chief Investment Officer Joey Krug before her responsibilities expanded. Bienvenu‚Äôs role now includes working with the investment team, tackling operational problems that arise and helping out portfolio companies, who often have young founders new to the world of business.  Bienvenu said operational support for founders includes business basics like creating an organizational chart and formulating a hiring process. Pantera also helps the startup craft a platform services group so that the technology can scale with the company.  Record-setting pace  Last year, digital asset prices rallied and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Paradigm launched record-breaking crypto funds. Did the asset price pullback at the beginning of 2022 slow venture capital investments?  ‚ÄúThese are 10-year vehicles, so that capital is locked into the space in a way that it hasn‚Äôt been before. I think you‚Äôre going to see that really smooth the volatility over time,‚Äù said Bienvenu.  As crypto fund sizes grow, an increasing number of firms, including a16z and Sequoia Capital, have filed to become registered investment advisers (RIAs) ‚Äì a move that skirts regulations that cap cryptocurrency investments for venture capital firms at 20% of a given fund. Pantera has been an RIA for years, Bienvenu said.  Women in crypto  Earlier this month, Bain Capital launched a new $560 million crypto fund, coincidentally on International Women‚Äôs Day, and drew backlash for the accompanying picture of the fund‚Äôs all-male team. The controversy renewed questions about diversity in the crypto industry.  ‚ÄúI think that there‚Äôs a reflexive assumption that the fact that there aren‚Äôt many women [in crypto] means that it‚Äôs a hostile environment for women,‚Äù said Bienvenu. ‚ÄúAnd, anecdotally, I could not find that to be farther from my experience. I‚Äôve never been in an environment that‚Äôs so purely meritcratic.‚Äù  However, Bienvenu said to dispel the myth the crypto ecosystem should work to broadcast that it is open to women.  ‚ÄúI think the lack of women is a broader issue,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúThere are so many engineers in the space, even investors and [chief financial officers] and others in non-technical roles. And women are just really underrepresented in that [developer] group.‚Äù  Regulatory turbulence  Bienvenu uses her background as a lawyer to tackle regulatory issues, a role few in the public sector want to take on because of the risks but that she views as a kind of public service.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think of it as lobbying for any particular policy agenda, but there‚Äôs such a lack of understanding on the part of the regulators and elected officials on just how the tech works,‚Äù she said. The results are policy proposals that anyone who understands the tech would see as unworkable or unenforceable.  Asked how she advises companies on navigating a regulatory environment that‚Äôs constantly in flux, Bienvenu said, ‚ÄúHonestly, it‚Äôs a challenge.‚Äù  Bienvenu said an important part of the process is sitting down with the startup team to make sure they at least broadly understand what regulatory areas they‚Äôre operating in, what laws currently exist and how Pantera expects the courts and regulators to decide on key decisions in the area. Pantera then helps portfolio companies devise a product roadmap that accounts for the regulatory uncertainty.  ‚ÄúIf we do it carefully, we‚Äôll minimize the disruption down the line when the legal questions do get figured out,‚Äù explained Bienvenu.  Emma Rose Bienvenu is speaking at CoinDesk‚Äôs Consensus festival, which runs June 9-12 in Austin, Texas.

Some alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) such as Solana's SOL and Polkadot's DOT token declined by as much as 6% over the past 24 hours.  Meanwhile, WAVES fell by 25% after USDN, an algorithmic stablecoin of the Waves ecosystem, lost its U.S. dollar peg. Last week, several people on Twitter accused the Waves team of manipulating the price of its native token through its decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Vires.finance.  Just launched! Sign up for Market Wrap, our daily newsletter explaining what happened today in crypto markets ‚Äì and why.  Despite the current pullback, some analysts remain optimistic about bitcoin's future price direction, pointing to improving blockchain data.  ""BTC is flowing out of exchanges at a rate of over 96,000 BTC per month, which means strong accumulation is taking place,"" Glassnode, a crypto data provider, wrote in a blog post on Monday. Both small and large-size holders have been accumulating bitcoin, especially after the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) purchased more than 30,000 BTC over the past week (track LFG reserve purchases here).  Still, the rise in BTC demand will need to be sustained to support the price recovery. ""A breakout of the 200-day moving average is required to confirm bullish sentiment,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email. ""Breaking out of the $45K-48K range could signal the start of a broader trend in the direction of the breakout.""

Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Bitcoin's trading volume across spot exchanges ticked lower over the past few days, according to CoinDesk data. There has been a persistent decline in trading activity since the Feb. 24 price dip toward $34,500, indicating some uncertainty among market participants despite the recent price rally.  Similarly, volatility in the bitcoin options market is also trending lower, while some traders have positioned themselves for a bullish run in the spot price.  ""Our conviction view now is to be short volatility as macroeconomic factors place pressure on markets while the LFG [buying] supports the market,"" QCP Capital, a Singapore-based crypto trading firm, wrote in a Telegram announcement. ""We think crypto prices will grind higher toward the second half of the year and any dip will be met with confident buying.""  Ether vs. bitcoin trade  Ether, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is up by 28% over the past month, compared with a 14% rise in bitcoin.  Further, ETH's put/call ratio significantly increased at the end of March, which means traders began to sell far out-of-the-money downside protection. The more negative skew in ETH presents an opportunity for some traders, according to Gregoire Magadini, CEO of Genesis Volatility.  ""The seven-day option skew is about -8 points, while BTC is only -4 points, despite the overall at-the-month implied volatility spread between ETH and BTC being rather close,"" Magadini wrote in a message to CoinDesk. ""For those looking to buy volatility, this means the short-term ETH calls are very cheap compared with similar BTC calls.""  This chart shows the ETH/BTC price ratio, which is approaching initial resistance at 0.076. The ratio is overbought on the daily chart, which typically precedes a brief pullback. The next major resistance level is at 0.082, which is roughly 8% away.

MVPs can be defined in many different ways. &apos;Viable&apos; is a legal term meaning &apos;actually practical&apos; or &apos;reasonably likely to succeed.&apos; MVPs, or Minimum Viable Products, are unfinished products created with minimal resources that solve (or convey that they solve) the problem the product is supposed to solve in its final form. This product is generally designed to analyze market demand. What Is MVP? Why Is It So Important? MVPs are a minimal form of your product tested on the target audience. You can do this by validating (or invalidating) assumptions about your product and learning how your target users will react to and experience its core features. This allocates your budget efficiently to meet your overall business objectives. MVPs are developed iteratively to identify user pain points and determine the appropriate functionality to address those needs....",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/a-guide-to-mvp/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

Related Reading | Full Speed Ahead: Ethereum Turns Bullish In The Long Term At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $45,500 with a 2% loss in the last 24-hours and the past week. The benchmark crypto experienced a relief rally into these levels, but bulls have been unable to sustain momentum beyond this period. As Bitcoin trends to the downside, there is around $20 million in bids orders that could operate as support, according to Data from Material Indicators (MI). As seen below, $44,000 holds the biggest support with $11 million in bids orders. MI records intensive selling from Binance order books, inventors have been dumping as much as $50 million in the last day which has contributed with BTC&apos;s price downside action. To the upside, resistance seems heavy and could prevent Bitcoin from reclaiming previous highs. MI records over $40 million in asks or selling orders. The increase in selling pressure suggest the bears could take over the price action, at least, in the short term.

The &apos;Spent Output Profit Ratio&apos; (or the SOPR in short) is a Bitcoin indicator that tells us whether coins in the market are selling at a profit or at a loss right now. The metric works by looking at the history of each coin being sold and checking whether the price it last moved at was less than the current one or more than it. When the value of this indicator is above one, it means investors are, on average, selling their Bitcoin at a profit right now.

No formal decision has yet been taken whether to issue the central bank digital currency (CBDC), but the European Union is already considering how to tie payment innovations to anti-money laundering rules, both for the digital euro and private cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin.  Ministers had agreed that any new format for the euro should ""accommodate privacy concerns,"" Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe told reporters, but new rules will also be ""counteracting the use of digital euros for unwarranted purposes.""  ""A risk-based approach could be followed allowing for more privacy for less risky and smaller transactions and vice versa,"" said Donohoe, who chairs the ministerial meetings known as the Eurogroup.  Offline payments for low value-payments made between people who are physically close, such as in stores and between friends, would help include those cut off from the financial system, he said, backing recent proposals made by the European Central Bank's Fabio Panetta.  The European Commission is due to present a consultation soon on any legislation that might be needed to back up the new digital euro, but has also been warned that an unduly centralized system could represent a ""honeypot"" of data for spies and constitute troubling mass surveillance.  ""A completely anonymous digital euro is not desirable,"" the European Commission's Paolo Gentiloni told reporters.  The European Parliament last week agreed on controversial new anti-money laundering rules that would require identification of those participating in even small-value payments of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, which many in the industry have said would invade privacy and stifle innovation.

42394246,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvagIt,1649096095,The Bigger Problem With Axie Infinity,"On March 23, $620 million was stolen from the blockchain network associated with Axie Infinity, a crypto-backed video game.  The vulnerability has to do with the structure of the game itself, which revolves around real money ‚Äì non-fungible tokens (NFT) ‚Äì rather than your standard in-game currency. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs known as a ‚Äúplay-to-earn‚Äù model: Playing the game can actually make you money, if you play your cards right.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Rather than operating directly on the tried and true Ethereum network, Axie Infinity uses a custom-built sidechain called Ronin ‚Äì essentially an Ethereum spin-off meant to reduce congestion on the main chain. In order to interact with applications built on Ronin, you‚Äôll need to port your crypto over to the network using a specialized program called a ‚Äúbridge.‚Äù  This was the site of last month‚Äôs exploit. Blockchain networks are notoriously difficult to mess with, in and of themselves ‚Äì it‚Äôs when you‚Äôre moving money between networks that cracks start to form. An attacker managed to steal around $610 million from Poly Network last year by going after the bridge. And just two months ago, the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Wormhole had its bridge hacked to the tune of $325 million.  In the case of Axie/Ronin, the company behind the network didn‚Äôt even notice the hack for about a week. Or if it did, it decided to take its time in formally announcing it: A blog post revealing the losses went up on March 29, six full days after the attacker made off with the funds.  ‚ÄúThis is when we show what we're made of,‚Äù tweeted Axie co-founder Jeff Zirlin at the time. ‚ÄúChaos is a ladder.‚Äù (The apparent ‚ÄùGame of Thrones‚Äù reference was not explained.)  This sort of dug-in flippancy has more or less been the mentality of the Axie Infinity team. The Ronin bridge remains down, which means Axie players can‚Äôt actually withdraw their crypto from the network, but top brass has apparently decided the show must go on. Sky Mavis, the company responsible for Axie Infinity, has said it plans to reimburse players for their lost funds. It also delayed the game‚Äôs next big upgrade, titled ‚ÄúAxie Infinity: Origin,‚Äù by a week.  But as Axie looks to retain its status as the single largest play-to-earn ecosystem on any blockchain, security issues may be the least of its worries.  Back in December, Zirlin described Axie Infinity‚Äôs play-to-earn mechanics as a kind of liberation for the world of online gaming.  ‚ÄúAll we‚Äôve done is we‚Äôve added a system of property rights into games,‚Äù he told me, referencing the idea that players can actually ‚Äúown‚Äù Axie NFTs on the blockchain. ‚ÄúSo, in some ways, we‚Äôve freed people. We‚Äôve given them something that they should have had all along.‚Äù  Read More: A Future Where Every Inch of Culture Is Monetized  In practice, though, Axie is a lesson in the dangers of play-to-earn.  While the game can make you money, it can also create debts. Playing the game requires a starting roster of three Axie NFTs, which can only be acquired on the secondary market. Players who can‚Äôt afford those initial NFTs (typically costing a couple hundred dollars) turn to Axie ‚Äúscholarship‚Äù programs, wherein wealthy benefactors front the buy-in in exchange for a cut of the profits.  Call it a gray market system ‚Äì it‚Äôs not officially sanctioned by Sky Mavis, but in countries like Venezuela and the Philippines, it has become a common mode of interacting with the game. Some popular lenders take as much as two-thirds of the total profits, per the data aggregator CoinGecko.  It‚Äôs part of why, according to a report from the research firm Naavik, the majority of Filipino Axie players are still making below the country‚Äôs average minimum wage. Stephen Diehl, a prominent crypto critic, likened it to ‚Äúdigital serfdom,‚Äù though I think that may be slightly misstating it. It‚Äôs more like an especially predatory employment contract ‚Äì a full-time job with extremely poor returns.  ‚ÄúThe scholar grinds daily, you split the profits,‚Äù one scholarship manager told Motherboard. ‚ÄúEverybody wins!""  This sort of attitude makes the ‚Äúserfdom‚Äù analog easy to grok. Sky Mavis was valued at $3 billion this past fall, and is backed by the venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz. As with any other crypto unicorn, there‚Äôs money to be made through speculation. Affiliated tokens AXS and SLP (smooth love potion) can be traded on decentralized exchanges outside of the game and have generated massive market capitalizations.  Meanwhile, the platform‚Äôs business model ‚Äì which has already been criticized for its resemblance to a Ponzi scheme ‚Äì relies heavily on this army of low-wage workers. They create value at the lowest level of the system (the game itself), most of which then flows out of their hands. It reflects an explicit power hierarchy: Those who start with the most money will always end up making the most money.  Read More: The First NFT Monopoly  A socialist might say that‚Äôs how many jobs already work. The difference is in the rhetoric: Zirlin claims to have ‚Äúfreed‚Äù his players when he has essentially recreated an existing, exploitative system on the blockchain.  This was the promise of Uber, too ‚Äì the idea that anyone could be a driver, with an increased degree of flexibility. You didn‚Äôt need a medallion from the Taxi and Limousine Commission and you could effectively set your own hours. Drivers understood they were employees, but Uber didn‚Äôt see it that way; it used a massive ad campaign to persuade California voters to vote ‚Äúyes‚Äù on a proposition that would exclude in-state gig workers from certain labor laws, and had no trouble getting its way.  As Axie Infinity scrambles to recover from the Ronin bridge hack, it‚Äôs putting its other fundamental issues on the back burner. There‚Äôs nothing inherently liberatory about the blockchain.",NEGATIVE,AXS,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/04/04/the-bigger-problem-with-axie-infinity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15d083bc730735fdb9374030504338ba2ae56ed9-800x461.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The token's price has risen 15% in the last 24 hours. CELO was trading at $4.20 at press time and is up almost 50% over the past 30 days.  At an event in Barcelona on Monday, the Celo Foundation announced ""Connect the World,"" a $20 million campaign to incentivize the development of high-quality Celo on- and off-ramps worldwide. The foundation also introduced ""Fiat Connect,"" an open-source application programming interface (API) specification for payment providers that will make integrations more scalable, according to Celo Foundation‚Äôs Medium post.  Celo is currently ranked 19th amongst decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms in terms of total value locked (TVL), according to analytics firm DeFi Llama. The coin has a market capitalization of $1.8 billion.  Celo is a protocol that acts as a global payment infrastructure for cryptocurrencies by using phone numbers as public keys and issuing a native stable-value token, according to Messari. It allows native and non-native digital assets (cryptographic and central bank digital currencies) to circulate freely across devices, carriers and countries, according to its website.  Edward Moya, senior analyst at Oanda, said Celo has been steadily attracting interest, as many investors are drawn to its crypto potential across smartphone technology and the opportunity it could have playing a key role in central bank digital currencies, known as CBDCs.  ‚ÄúWhat also helps Celo is that it works using proof-of-stake and is offsetting carbon, which makes it appealing to many climate-focused investors,‚Äù added Moya.  According to Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Funds, Celo‚Äôs price action could be attributed to the Celo Connect event, which continues Tuesday.  ‚ÄúWe reckon it is probably an event-related price rise as traders speculate on positive surprises during the conference,‚Äù added Neo.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/04/celo-rises-15-on-barcelona-reveal-of-20m-connect-the-world-campaign,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e659280805e23494908ce8a2c6397eb4b2be7d67-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423616,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2bmHh,1649094536,Crypto‚Äôs Night at the Grammys,"‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in Las Vegas,‚Äù Trevor Noah, comedian and host of the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, said Sunday night during the show‚Äôs opening remarks. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like if crypto was a city.‚Äù  The crypto joke (one of two by Noah on the night) was far from the sector‚Äôs only cameo. From sponsored events and afterparties to non-fungible token (NFT) meetups, the space once again found itself intertwined with mainstream entertainment.  Two Grammy partnerships in particular dominated the weekend‚Äôs festivities, one with crypto exchange Binance and the other with OneOf, a music non-fungible token platform on the Tezos blockchain.  OneOf‚Äôs prominence on the weekend came as part of a three-year partnership the platform signed with the Recording Academy back in November. The deal will lead to various NFT sales from high-profile artists and award winners, many of which, like Doja Cat and H.E.R., have already released collections on the platform.  Binance kept a lower profile throughout the weekend (an official afterparty aside) but a spokesperson teased ‚Äúlarger partnership plans‚Äù to be announced later.  Grammy NFTs  With every major artist seeming to be experimenting with NFT drops nowadays, their presence in Vegas this weekend was at times ubiquitous.  At a pool party outside the MGM Grand, Steve Aoki, crowned ‚ÄúDJ prince of Web 3,‚Äù performed his set amid a backdrop of flashing screens promoting the ‚ÄúA0K1VERSE,‚Äù his NFT-gated membership club.  ‚ÄúSteve Aoki is actually the reason I got into NFTs,‚Äù one onlooker said from the pool.  ‚ÄúAOKIVEEEEERSE,‚Äù another yelled.  Across the street was a meetup for the NFT project OnChainMonkey, which helped host various events for its holders throughout the weekend, including a pool party of its own and a meal at the Bellagio Hotel.  ‚ÄúWe actually weren‚Äôt planning to even come to Vegas this weekend, but then I was just scrolling through the Discord two days ago and saw it was happening,‚Äù Bryan Hernandez, a holder of the NFT project, told CoinDesk. ‚ÄúFor a second I wasn‚Äôt sure about it, but then I saw there was gonna be brunch included. I had my hotel booked 10 minutes later.‚Äù  Read more: Binance Is Sponsoring the Grammys This Year  At one point in the Grammys telecast Noah made an NFT reference that landed a lot better than his opening Vegas line.  ‚ÄúYou know it‚Äôs been rough when your favorite artists go from trying to sell you music to pictures of digital monkeys,‚Äù Noah quipped.  The joke, of course, was an allusion to the Bored Ape Yacht NFT collection and its rise to media stardom. (After the joke, the camera panned to Justin Bieber, who purchased an NFT from the collection in February.)  ‚ÄòEntertainment‚Äôs newest asset class‚Äô  For all the silliness NFTs bring to events like the Grammys, the business behind them is anything but.

Confirmation of today&apos;s losses could see CHZ fall to $0.24 in a retest of February 2022 highs. Past Performance of Chilliz The CHZ price is down six percent in a bear breakout formation versus the USDT in the past 24 hours. The token is pulling back from March 2022 highs of around $0.32. Notably, the bear engulfing bar of April 4 is wide-ranging, reversing gains registered in the last trading week. CHZ Technical Analysis A bearish engulfing pattern in the daily chart suggests bull trend exhaustion. Although buyers rallied 125 percent from mid-February 2022, sellers appear to be in charge at spot rates. Preceding today&apos;s lower lows was consolidation with long upper wicks pointing to selling pressure in smaller time frames.

Nevertheless, the digital asset still remains one of the most promising in the crypto space and has demonstrated that with its recent recovery. But even after successfully landing above $3,000, the cryptocurrency still remains a long way from its all-time high of almost $5,000. However, the long-term indicators paint a favorable picture for Ethereum. Beating Moving Averages For the longest time following the December crash, the price of Ethereum had traded below important moving averages like the 50 and 100-day moving averages. Mostly this was a direct result of the continuous downtrend that rocked not only the digital asset but the entire crypto market. However, with the recent recoveries, Ethereum has been able to make significant strides price-wise and now sits above these important moving averages.

One of the first steps will be to bring stablecoins into the U.K. payments system, according to Sunak‚Äôs statement and to comments made by John Glen, a minister of state at the Treasury, at the Global Finance Summit.  ""This will enable consumers to use stablecoin payment services with confidence,‚Äù Glen said. ‚ÄúThe government will introduce this legislation as part of an ambition to deliver a world-leading regulatory regime for stablecoins.""  Read more: The UK Wants to Regulate Crypto: Here's What That Could Look Like  In 2019, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the U.K.'s financial regulator, published a report on crypto that said that crypto firms with digital assets for cross-border payments could be subject to payments services regulations but that the tokens themselves wouldn‚Äôt be regulated.  Taxes  Meanwhile, the Treasury is looking to engage closely with the public on changes it wants to make to the tax system. ""We don't think the tax code will need major surgery to make it work more easily for crypto,"" Glen said.  ‚ÄúThe U.K. is also playing a leading role in negotiations on the new tax reporting framework to enhance tax transparency and consumer confidence while enabling a level playing field in tax reporting globally,‚Äù he added.  Additionally, the U.K. Treasury will aim to resolve specific issues like the treatment of decentralized finance loans and staking. Plus, it will amend the investment manager exemption to remove any stipulations that discourage U.K. fund managers from including crypto assets in their portfolios.  Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) haven't escaped U.K. regulator scrutiny. The Treasury asked the Law Commission, an independent body tasked with making sure laws in England and Wales are fair, to consider the legal status of DAOs. A DAO is a blockchain-based organization or company that is usually governed by a native crypto token, with anyone holding the tokens able to vote on important company decisions.  The crypto regime  In addition to the stablecoin legislation, the Treasury is marching on with broader plans to set up a ‚Äúworld-leading regime ‚Ä¶ [facilitating] safe and sustainable and I hope, rapid innovation,‚Äù Glen said.  The government will form a industry group called the ""Crypto Asset Engagement Group"" to help guide the next steps in regulation. The chairman of that group will be at the ministerial level, and the group will include senior representatives from the FCA, Bank of England and businesses, Glen said. It will meet up to eight times a year.  There are also plans for legislation establishing a financial market infrastructure, or ‚Äúsandbox,‚Äù that will enable firms to test distributed ledger technology.  Meanwhile, the FCA will hold a two-day ""CryptoSprint"" in May, where it will seek views from the industry on issues related to developing crypto regulations.  An NFT?

42423604,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2bm3h,1649089800,Staking Solution Chorus One Launches Up to $30M Proof-of-Stake Investment Fund,"Chorus One, which provides proof-of-stake (PoS) staking systems to over 28 decentralized networks, has launched a new fund to invest $25 million to $30 million from its balance sheet in PoS networks, protocols and related products over the next three years, according to a draft announcement provided to CoinDesk.  The Ethereum blockchain plans to soon switch from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake, bringing more attention to the process in which asset owners stake their coins for the right to validate new transaction blocks and add them to the blockchain. Leading PoS blockchains include Avalanche, Cardano, Polkadot and Solana.  Founded in 2018 by Brian Crain and Meher Roy, Chorus One came to life as PoS staking was finding its footing. The company was one of the stakers in the early incentivized testnet for the Cosmos network of interoperable blockchains.  ‚ÄúOur business at the start had almost no revenues [and was] struggling to survive,‚Äù Xavier Meegan, research and ventures lead at Chorus One, told CoinDesk in an interview. ‚ÄúThe last two years or so, our balance sheet has grown substantially. We now have enough revenue to invest off of our balance sheet.‚Äù  Chorus One has previously deployed ‚Äúmillions‚Äù of dollars to 26 projects before formally setting up a venture investment arm, according to Meegan. The company has prioritized investments in networks where the company runs nodes, the mechanisms that make staking possible. The staking provides deep technical knowledge, rewards, tokens and revenue, and the additional investment can result in even more tokens, Meegan said.  The new Chorus Ventures fund also offers operational support beyond staking. For example, the team‚Äôs researchers can advise networks about token economics and mechanism design.  PoS networks have been a key investment area for Chorus Ventures, including potential accelerators for PoS adoption such as liquid staking and tools such as wallets and user experience design. Other areas of interest include interoperability solutions that allow PoS networks to communicate and middleware that helps developers create decentralized applications (dapps) more efficiently.  ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre going to secure a network and run a node, we‚Äôre putting in our own resources, our own work ‚Ä¶ to make sure the network goes live,‚Äù said Meegan. ‚ÄúThis is stuff that [venture capitalists] VCs don‚Äôt do.‚Äù  Read more: Staking Giant Lido Expands to Solana",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | DOT | ETH,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/04/staking-solution-chorus-one-launches-30m-proof-of-stake-investment-fund,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ad8f6bd55b7c6386f20ecaeb727b1394d26072e0-500x334.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411827,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgDfs,1649081365,India Crypto Tax Guide 2022,"Just the thought of paying tax on crypto transactions has generated creative memes in popular Indian digital culture. We get it! It‚Äôs not easy. The government‚Äôs proposal, which lays down how much crypto tax is to be paid, is enough to give anyone a headache.  This piece is part of CoinDesk‚Äôs Tax Week.  Tax season starts on April 1, 2022. Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the proposals in her budget speech on Feb 1, declaring cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFT) and any other crypto asset are, under a broad definition, ‚Äúvirtual digital assets.‚Äù This means crypto-assets and NFTs are subject to a tax on profits, similar to stocks in the equity market.  When do Indian citizens have to pay tax on crypto?  The date to file taxes for the year 2020-2021 has been extended three times and has now expired. It was last due on March 15, 2022.  For taxes to be filed for the year 2021-2022, April 1, 2022, is when one can technically start the process of calculating or filing returns but the last date for individuals is July 31, 2022. It‚Äôs worth noting that this date is often extended by the government.  For individuals and businesses required to undergo tax audit, the last date for filing tax returns for the financial year 2021-2022 is Oct. 31, 2022. The last date for filing tax returns for the financial year 2020-2021 has already passed (Feb. 15, 2022) for the following taxpayers:  A company  A person other than a company whose accounts are required to be audited under the Income Tax Act (ITA) or any other law  A partner of a firm whose accounts are required to be audited under the ITA or any other law or the spouse of such a partner (in certain cases)  Filing of an audit report by a taxpayer required to file an accountant‚Äôs report under Section 92E.  Filing of accountant‚Äôs report under Section 92E.  The Finance Minister also said that ‚Äúto provide an opportunity to correct an error, taxpayers can now file an updated return within two years from the relevant assessment year,‚Äù framing the move ‚Äúas an affirmative step towards voluntary compliance.‚Äù  Read More: Avoid Crypto Tax Headaches: What You Need to Know if You Bought or Sold Crypto in 2021  This step can also be construed as a signal to crypto investors to disclose gains and pay taxes on them from the last two years.  Tax lawyers say crypto users should pay their taxes from whenever they started making gains on their digital assets, irrespective of which year it was.  ‚ÄúThe government can technically haul up a crypto dabbler for not paying taxes on gains from at least up to the last five or six years,‚Äù said Rajat Mittal, a tax lawyer.  It is advisable that if there are undeclared gains from the past years they should have been declared in the returns for the period ending March 31, 2022.  How much crypto tax do you pay in India?  The Indian government has set out a number of requirements for taxpayers in the Indian Finance Bill 2022 including:  30% tax on profits made from cryptocurrencies, including NFT sales and mining rewards.  This 30% tax on profit takes into account a 1% TDS (tax deduction at source) deposited by the facilitator/exchanges/person responsible for paying the consideration on every crypto transaction that can be calculated from July 1, 2022, onwards.  30% tax on gifts.  The catch here is that gifts from immediate relatives are exempt but gifts from friends are not.  How to prepare for crypto tax season in India  Start with a clean slate. This means calculating all crypto gains of every virtual digital asset you've owned before April 2022.  Maintain a record of the India Rupee (INR) value of cryptocurrencies at the time of sale (for example between bitcoin and ether) because you will pay your taxes in fiat currency and not cryptocurrencies. This is imperative because the value of cryptocurrencies constantly fluctuates.  If you are doing a peer-to-peer trade without using an exchange then you need to have a tax deduction account number (TAN) for tax deducted at source (TDS). These TDS returns have to be filed on a quarterly basis.  Individuals having profits on virtual digital assets have to file returns by filing the form known as Income Tax Return 1, 2, 3 or 4, as applicable.  Businesses have to file returns by filing the form known as Income Tax Return 5 or 6, as applicable.  Source for tax return forms applicability: https://cleartax.in/s/which-itr-to-file  All of these details must be compiled in an income tax return to be submitted to the income tax department. For all questions regarding taxation on crypto, the government has provided a memorandum explaining the provisions in the finance bill that can be accessed here.

Like many of the artists now intimately involved with non-fungible tokens (NFT), Alcindor ‚Äì better known as the mononymous rapper Latash√° ‚Äì began the year without much of an interest in crypto. She‚Äôd already found a kind of underground success in her native Brooklyn, N.Y., with a series of independent albums and singles released over the past few years.  This article is part of¬†Road to Consensus, a series highlighting speakers and the big ideas they will discuss at¬†Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas.¬†Learn more.  Music had been a side hustle before she started making real money from it; stints at companies like Urban Outfitters and JPMorgan (JPM) helped pay the bills. ‚ÄúI was doing three shows a week while also working my nine-to-five,‚Äù she said. Sustained collaborations with two prominent New York performance spaces, National Sawdust and The Shed, helped raise her profile, but the songs themselves were never her primary source of income.  This interview originally appeared as part of CoinDesk's Culture Week, in December 2021.  It was Alcindor‚Äôs partner, the artist Jahmel Reynolds, who got her hooked on non-fungible tokens back in February.  ‚ÄúIt was right during the [coronavirus] pandemic. We were both trying to figure out supplemental income,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt really perform, couldn‚Äôt really do anything. And then Jah came to me one day and was like, ‚ÄòYo, you ever heard of this thing?‚Äô‚Äù  Alcindor said she didn‚Äôt pay much attention until Reynolds started to generate income from his NFTs. It was a sign of a clear momentum at a moment when cash was scarce ‚Äì and money has a way of melting away some of that initial skepticism. She minted her first token (tied to one of her music videos) on a protocol called Zora, and one of the site‚Äôs co-founders snapped it up for $1000.  ‚ÄúSince then,‚Äù quipped Alcindor, ‚ÄúI was hitting the ground running.‚Äù  Zora hired her as the company‚Äôs head of community programming in June, and she‚Äôs been promoting the brand ever since. At this year‚Äôs Art Basel, in Miami, Alcindor hosted Zoratopia IRL ‚Äì a day-long event focused around the intersection of culture and crypto, with an emphasis on Black NFT creators.  NFTs remain relatively inaccessible, thanks to crypto‚Äôs technical barrier to entry (interacting with these systems is exceedingly complicated) and consistently high fees. Putting art on the blockchain is far more expensive than just uploading it to Instagram.  The way Alcindor sees it, the potential benefits are well worth the price of entry; you won‚Äôt find music videos selling for thousands of dollars on Instagram.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to encourage marginalized communities to come on board,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs beautiful to see people see other people‚Äôs stories and be like, ‚ÄòI could do that too.‚Äô‚Äù  Our conversation, condensed and edited for clarity, is below.  What‚Äôs excited you most about the relationship between music and NFTs? And what projects have you been exploring in that niche?  The thing that caught my eye the most about music and NFTs was the agency that it gave back to artists. I have been trying to stay away from labels for years because independence was my goal. And I‚Äôve also just seen a lot of label deals be terrible. When I got into music and NFTs I realized, oh, I can have full agency and full authority of all my choices and what I‚Äôm getting paid for. So, platforms like Zora, like Catalog, I‚Äôm even looking into sound.xyz right now.  No major labels seem to have really cracked NFTs yet, even if they‚Äôve tried ‚Äì do you think that‚Äôs something we‚Äôll see in the near future?  The system is a mess, and the system is rigged. I‚Äôm not gonna even sugarcoat it for you. The system that major labels are running with right now is wrecked and problematic and needs to completely shift in order for them to work within NFTs. I really don‚Äôt believe that major labels will do well with an NFT, because this thing is literally made for autonomy, for sovereignty, for artists to figure out how to, like, do this on their own. It‚Äôs so direct to artists and consumers that I don‚Äôt see the possibilities of major labels really being able to hold it, unless they create a whole new system around it.  I just feel like artists are not going to be here for the [garbage]. I‚Äôve even had some talks with major artists, and they are working on leaving their labels right now, because of the surge that NFTs are showing. But the tables always turn ‚Äì that‚Äôs how it is. We just gotta make sure that while we‚Äôre setting these trends and rules with NFTs, we do them the right way. And that‚Äôs my work every day.  Is there anything you‚Äôre skeptical about, in this space? It‚Äôs easy to get starry-eyed very quickly.  My only skepticism is just overall with NFTs, making sure that culture and that communities of different diasporas are taken focus on. Crypto is still very white, tech, male. And a lot of the abundance is going to that group and not so much to the marginalized communities. And I‚Äôm really hoping and pushing for collectors to be focusing more on other groups and faces and places. So let‚Äôs not act like this is la-la land, we‚Äôre still dealing with racism, we‚Äôre still dealing with classism, and all the things. But I think if we could nip it in the bud early and quickly through NFTs right now, I think we‚Äôre gonna see a big transformation and change in the economy and the gaps that we‚Äôre dealing with.  Do you think that culture is starting to change at all?  I hope. I don‚Äôt know. I do believe that a lot of people are doing the work to do the changes.  You‚Äôve spoken in the past about hostility in the NFT community, specifically at NFT.NYC. Was that whole week a negative experience?  The whole experience wasn‚Äôt negative because we decided to transform the experience in itself. Honestly, I felt kind of shunned from the actual NFT.NYC conference. But I just created my own experiences. When we went there, a lot of the events had invited me but I couldn‚Äôt get in, or me and my homies couldn‚Äôt get in. And then at one event, I performed, and they cut my set after one song. The music director said I was too aggressive and loud so they cut my set, and then they cut all the hip-hop sets after me.  It just goes to show you what we deal with in certain spaces. After that, though, we just made a decision to create our own spaces that really could equate to our safety and what we need. So I ended up creating Zoratopia IRL at Art Basel off of that experience at NFT.NYC.  What was it like to host your own event in Miami after that experience?  It was just such a dope feeling to see what we‚Äôve been growing online now find a new place to be, and feel full and at their greatest selves. And I was just so full of gratitude to have created this event, because I just wanted to see us have a place where we could speak and celebrate and do all the things. And Zoratopia really became that for me, and I‚Äôm really excited to see that continue. Hopefully I can get to tour it next year, with my music and with other things that I‚Äôm doing. So, I‚Äôm hype.  See also: How a Collection of 1M Music NFTs Could Mint the Next Platinum Record  Do you feel like crypto‚Äôs high fees and technical barriers to entry are having a particular effect on underrepresented communities?  One side of it is transforming the monetary mindset. I think a lot of artists came up from scarcity, and this idea that we didn‚Äôt have it, or we wouldn‚Äôt have it do these things. And a lot of the ones that I‚Äôve onboarded, they‚Äôve complained about the gas fee, and then minted their pieces and sold five times or 10 times more than their gas fee equated to. And they‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúI was so worried about that thing at one point, but now I‚Äôm not so worried about it anymore.‚Äù  But then on the other side, we have opportunities like the Mint Fund created by Ameer ‚ÄúSirsu‚Äù [Suhayb Carter], where we‚Äôre supporting artists and paying for the gas fees. We‚Äôre trying to encourage marginalized communities to come on board. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs beautiful to see people see other people‚Äôs stories and be like, ‚ÄòI could do that too.‚Äô And some of them came from my really rough times. I mean, if you talk to [the musician] Ibn Inglor, he grew up in the hoods of Chicago, and then started getting into Web 3 and crypto, and did a crowdfund and got 20 ETH for his latest project. It‚Äôs something that he never believed could have happened for him. But now he‚Äôs seeing it and he knows it could happen. It‚Äôs just beautiful to see people‚Äôs minds change and their hearts change through this space.  What would you say to artists who are hesitant about crypto, who feel like maybe it‚Äôs too much of a gamble, or too much of an investment to get involved?  I came up from gambling a lot of my life ‚Äì I‚Äôm just big on the leap. I‚Äôm a risk taker and everybody‚Äôs not like that. And if it‚Äôs not for you, it‚Äôs not for you. And that‚Äôs okay, too. I tell that to a lot of people who are skeptical about it. You don‚Äôt have to force this to yourself. If anything, I feel like I didn‚Äôt even force NFTs on me, NFTs just came to me, and it was like, alright, this makes sense. It‚Äôs all good if you‚Äôre not with it, but it‚Äôs gonna come to you eventually.  I come from being broke. Like, Brooklyn, New York, broke, dollar pizza life. And there were days where I would never believe this was going to happen to me. Or maybe I did, I just didn‚Äôt know how it was gonna happen. I did not know NFTs were going to be the thing, but I just always had this belief that I was going to be in my wellness and in my care. But I can‚Äôt force anybody to get into it. This is an organic thing that people have to like, decide for themselves if it‚Äôs for them.  And if you are ready to try to get into the game, I always tell people: Start with something small, never something huge. Don‚Äôt put all your money into this thing at once. Take a few hundred dollars. And if that‚Äôs what you can afford, mint something, or buy something even. And see what happens. Because if you‚Äôre just being skeptical, you‚Äôll never see anything out of it.

42394247,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvagO1,1649080411,Why Bitcoin Mining Is a Matter of National Security,"Let‚Äôs start with a simple fact: Buying and holding bitcoin (BTC), the asset, is not what gives people power over the Bitcoin network. Holding bitcoin simply means being able to benefit from the network‚Äôs adoption and growth (expressed in price appreciation) and it affords users with features such as ownership of a scarce bearer asset that can be transacted quickly, cheaply and without permission from any intermediaries.  However, the security, integrity and evolution of the network rests with coders, miners and the thousands of individual nodes who track the blockchain continuously. In other words, rather than holding bitcoin as shares, when it comes to influence it‚Äôs about having a stake in the network itself ‚Äì most importantly, as a miner.  Ben Caselin is head of research and strategy at AAX.  The significance of holding power over a global network should be obvious. Whether it‚Äôs OPEC, SWIFT, the Strait of Hormuz or internet infrastructure, it‚Äôs clear how well-positioned stakeholders can leverage their measure of control over a network to exert influence. With Bitcoin, however, much of the authority rests in hash power. That‚Äôs where mining comes in as a matter of national security.  National security is a term often used (and misused) to justify policies of surveillance, military deployments, technologies or other legal implementations. In its most benign form, national security is a defensive stance aimed at ensuring the safety, stability and sovereignty of a given jurisdiction, and is a stepping stone towards a more equitable global power distribution and possibly peace.  As the Bitcoin network grows from an internet curiosity to a global settlement layer that's open to all ‚Äì potentially even sanctions evaders like Russia or North Korea ‚Äì nation-states may come to realize they want a greater say in the direction and overall operations of the network. To this end, having a stake in global hashrate is key. By fostering, rather than banning domestic mining industries, nations can also ensure that control over the network does not fall into the hands of their enemies.  Read more: Is Miner Concentration Once Again Jeopardizing Bitcoin? Not Exactly  Power on the Bitcoin network  The amount of influence a bitcoin miner gets is proportional to the amount of computational power ‚Äì or work ‚Äì they put into the network. That‚Äôs called hash power. It‚Äôs an overall calculation of computational work. More work means more influence.  It should be noted, however, that influence is limited: Miners cannot create extra bitcoin, steal coins or change the underlying code. Rather, influence is what guarantees that transactions actually go through and get included on the blockchain.  Proof-of-work mining is integral to how the Bitcoin blockchain works. Around the world, miners look for cheap energy sources to run their mining rigs at maximum capacity at the lowest possible cost. The more hash power miners can muster, the higher the chance is they will win a next block, receive the reward of 6.25 newly minted bitcoin and, crucially, add their version of ‚Äútransnational truth‚Äù to the global Bitcoin ledger.  In this system, roughly every 10 minutes a new block of records is added to the blockchain, and only when a block has been verified and validated will transactions become permanent. It should be stressed that individual nodes around the world need to accept the new block, which they will do automatically if all the rules of the Bitcoin protocol have indeed been respected and no double-spending or manipulation has occurred.  Meddling with the record is extremely costly. First of all, even with a large stake in global hashrate, probability dictates that this does not guarantee winning each block. Second, if a corrupted block of transactions was indeed to go through and was consequently rejected by the majority of nodes, any reward associated with that block would be annulled.  Nonetheless, while Bitcoin‚Äôs decentralized nature affords it its status as the most secure network in the world, its security would be severely compromised if, say, a given miner ‚Äì perhaps acting on behalf of a state actor ‚Äì were to gain the majority hashrate (i.e., 51%). Technically this would open the network up to the potential for censorship of other miners and transactions, and similar forms of overreach.  But to really see the argument and understand how having a stake in global hashrate supports national security and eventually adds to geopolitical equilibrium, we have to look at the incentives for participation from a number of different angles.  Game-theory in action  In 2019, the world‚Äôs largest crypto exchange, Binance, suffered a hack that saw $40 million worth of bitcoin scuttled from its coffers. The company‚Äôs CEO, Changpeng Zhao, then publicly floated the idea of ""rolling back"" Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain, which would recover the stolen funds back into Binance‚Äôs custody (and reverse all transactions on the blockchain that had occurred since the theft).  Doing so would require convincing a majority of bitcoin miners and node operators to follow his plan. Pushback from the bitcoin community was immediate and no rollback was attempted. From the onset, consensus was against Binance and the company had to take the loss and fix its internal systems instead. Imagine if geopolitics could be as straightforward.  Consensus in the industry isn‚Äôt always conservative, despite a great degree of emphasis being put on blockchain‚Äôs ‚Äúimmutability.‚Äù Changes can be made, as was the case in 2016 after the Ethereum community voted to fork the chain to recover $50 million in stolen ether (ETH) following The DAO attack.  Consensus was that the move was vital for the rehabilitation of the nascent blockchain, although a sizable portion of the community did reject the intervention. The Ethereum network we know today, which Microsoft (MSFT), JPMorgan (JPM), Amazon (AMZN) and other corporate giants are reportedly already using, and with a market cap of over $300 billion, is a result of that rollback. Technically, it‚Äôs an off-shoot. Its predecessor, the original Ethereum chain where the hack has not been undone, is now known as Ethereum Classic. It has a market cap of a little over $3.5 billion.  The same mechanism that helps ensure blockchains are difficult to change is essential when it is time to upgrade the network. Hash power drives both integrity and change, and represents a type of influence in being able to enforce norms and preventing abuses on the network ‚Äì all of which requires consensus.  Currently, the U.S. is home to the most hash power, a position it earned after China forced miners within its borders to shut down. I‚Äôd argue it was a mistake for China to drive out its domestic mining industry because the more hash power that resides in a given country, the more influence the state could have in protecting its interests. And let there be no misgivings: bitcoin is held and still thrives among Chinese investors.  Read more: Is Bitcoin Legal in the United States?  Imagine, for argument‚Äôs sake, the U.S. housed zero miners and instead all hash power resided in Russia. This would not bode well for bitcoin investors, or investors in publicly traded companies exposed to bitcoin like MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Tesla (TSLA) in the U.S., given that Russia is both a technologically savvy country and profoundly undemocratic.  Similarly, what if none of bitcoin‚Äôs hash power resided in Russia but was dominated by the U.S. and its allies? This would discourage Russian elites from storing their wealth in bitcoin and hamper potential efforts on Russia‚Äôs part around using bitcoin for global trade.  Granted, not all power resides with miners. Without the agreement by a majority of individual nodes, bitcoin can not easily be weaponized or be subject to intervention. However, if, say, North Korea were to hack an exchange (as it has allegedly done before) and was intent on using these funds to stage a devastating nuclear attack on the world, it‚Äôs likely that even the most fanatical proponents of freedom and financial agency ‚Äì stalwart bitcoiners ‚Äì could be persuaded to support an intervention in the blockchain.  What‚Äôs of interest here as well is how individuals are able to participate freely in this global consensus network. We can see a direct link of reasoning and incentive that runs all the way from engaged individual participants spread out across the world to industrial-scale miners that have the potency to become integral to geopolitics.  That said, miners residing in a shared jurisdiction do not necessarily share the same values, nor should we assume agreement between miners and the State. But we can foresee the formation of clusters through the establishment of associations, such as the Bitcoin Mining Council, State-initiated mining facilities such as in El Salvador or even certain regulations with which at least public mining companies would have to comply. In the end, consensus is not about homogeneity but about maintaining a balance of power ‚Äì one that cuts across countries and viewpoints.  Unless an entire population decides to stay away from bitcoin, each jurisdiction is incentivized to gain a stake in global hashrate, just as domestic miners vie for local hash power. On Russia‚Äôs end, this might be to mine new bitcoin for local wealth generation, secure an avenue for trade and also to protect the assets of its citizens, invested corporations and, in future, potentially, its national reserves.  For the U.S. or the European Union it is not just about protecting its investors; it‚Äôs really about retaining regulatory clout. U.S. President Joe Biden‚Äôs executive order of March 9 calling for a unified approach to U.S. crypto regulation may impact legacy and find easy implementation at the surface layer of applications around crypto. We saw this recently when Ethereum wallet MetaMask and non-fungible token (NFT) platform OpenSea ‚Äì both U.S.-based projects ‚Äì unilaterally blocked Iranian and Venezuelan users from using their services.  However, unlike these apps and the majority of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin has no CEO or homebase ‚Äì it is an open and decentralized network. And so any attempt at regulation at the level of protocol or around security requires hash power to reside in the concerned jurisdiction. No hash power, no say.  It goes without saying that for any jurisdiction exposed to bitcoin, either through its citizens and the corporations it resides over or as part of sovereign wealth funds, having a stake in global hash power is vital.  Towards geopolitical equilibrium  An important aspect of this argument is to recognize that Bitcoin‚Äôs share of the global financial system is growing rapidly. It may seem marginal today but global adoption of bitcoin, the asset, continues to unfold at a faster pace even than the growth of the Internet witnessed in the late 1990s.  We know the reasons individuals and corporations may wish to save in bitcoin or place the asset on their balance sheet. Over the past two years especially we‚Äôve seen more everyday people, billionaires, corporations, hedge funds and even countries warm up, if not fully embrace, bitcoin.  It should become increasingly clear why the next phase in the growth of this network and asset class is likely to include a race for hash power, in conjunction with the realization by both investors and regulators that participating in the operation of the network itself is the best way to secure public interests in the long run.  Bitcoin does not just offer an investable asset, where holders benefit from its scarce supply and freedom from arbitrary policy-making and money printing. More broadly, it offers a global network for the settlement of an internet-native currency that falls outside the control of any single entity. It offers an alternative base-layer for the development of a more equitable global financial system which is both borderless and democratic by design. It constitutes the disarmament of finance, while still allowing for bottom-line moral imperatives to impact on consensus and execution.  As the global community of investors in bitcoin continues to expand, the significance of having hash power grows daily. As do the risks of not having it. That makes mining bitcoin a matter of national security.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING,Ben Caselin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/04/04/why-bitcoin-mining-is-a-matter-of-national-security,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/29166ac0a94034581d5542f36dcabb661ef77723-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421189,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgIYP,1649079963,Garry Kasparov: 'Bitcoin Will Remain as a Standard',"Garry Kasparov knows math. He knows logic, strategy and decision-making. Widely regarded as the greatest chess player in the history of mankind, the Russian grandmaster ‚Äì ranked No. 1 from 1984 to 2005 ‚Äì sees the world with a certain clarity.  So it will delight many in the blockchain industry to learn that Kasparov, easily one of the smartest people alive, is now a champion of cryptocurrency. And it‚Äôs partly because of math. Kasparov has spent his ‚Äúretirement‚Äù opposing Russian President Vladimir Putin (a defiance that once got him tossed in jail), fighting for humanitarian causes and serving as chairman of the Human Rights Foundation (a nonprofit that strongly supports bitcoin as a freedom-giving tool). Now he views crypto as a way to check government power. Bitcoin (BTC) offers protection against rampant government spending, says Kasparov, ‚Äúbecause you‚Äôre protected by math‚Äù ‚Äì by the logic of the code itself.  This article is part of Road to Consensus, a series highlighting speakers and the big ideas they will discuss at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more.  Kasparov also sees merit in non-fungible tokens (NFT). In December, in partnership with 1Kind, he dropped a series of 32 NFTs that showcase iconic moments from his life: the 1985 match that crowned him as the youngest world chess champion, the epic battle against IBM's (IBM) artificial intelligence-powered ‚ÄúDeep Blue‚Äù computer and speeches against totalitarian governments.  It‚Äôs this battle against totalitarianism that has defined the current chapter of his life, and Kasparov sees crypto as part of that struggle. Or as the grandmaster puts it, ‚ÄúI believe that supporting crypto is an important part of my contribution to the future of humanity.‚Äù  This interview, which originally appeared in January, has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  CoinDesk: How‚Äôd you get into the crypto space?  Kasparov: If you followed my career and read about my early interest in computers and technology, you should not be surprised that I was very excited when I recognized the value of cryptocurrencies and NFTs.  This goes all the way back to the 1980s; I always tried to be at the cutting edge. It started with chess. But I also saw an opportunity to use computers and new tools to advance individual freedoms. It‚Äôs my belief that technology should help people fight back against the power of the state.  How do cryptocurrencies fit into that?  Cryptocurrencies become an inseparable part of or progress, because the whole world is moving digital. And if the economy becomes more digital, so does the money. Another philosophical reason is that ‚Ä¶ governments [have] unlimited opportunities to print money. And printing money is the most exquisite form of borrowing from us and from future generations.  And I believe that cryptocurrencies ‚Äì with bitcoin as a standard ‚Äì offer a protection against this onslaught of the government, because you‚Äôre protected by math. You‚Äôre protected by the limited number of any code behind the respective currency. Cryptocurrencies, and all the products related to cryptocurrencies, are absolutely vital for the future development of our world.  How, specifically, did you first get involved?  My first indirect involvement was through the Human Rights Foundation. Because in the Human Rights Foundation, we had a few experts that have been advocating cryptocurrencies at a very early stage. And as an organization, we offer support to the dissidents around the world.  We thought about using crypto as a way to help them to get material help, because in many countries it was impossible ‚Äì and it‚Äôs still impossible ‚Äì to actually get proper funding. So crypto offered an opportunity to support these activists indirectly. And the more I learned about it, the more interested I got in the whole mechanism.  Can you elaborate on why this is important to you?  Look, crypto is a controversial thing. Because you hear a lot of people say, ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs money laundering. That helps bad guys.‚Äù True. I mean, no technology is uniquely good, because it‚Äôs technology. Humans still have a monopoly for evil.  So, I‚Äôve been doing a lot of talks about it, and I‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúLook, it‚Äôs not the magic wand or the terminator. It‚Äôs not a harbinger of utopia or dystopia. It‚Äôs a tool.‚Äù Crypto is a tool. And of course it could benefit some bad guys with maligned intentions. But it‚Äôs about the balance, it‚Äôs about trade-offs. And I think the balance is so much in favor of progress.  It‚Äôs like the dot-com bubble; 99.9% will be gone. But those that survive will become the Googles of the world.  You mentioned crypto‚Äôs ability to help protect human rights in undemocratic countries. What do you see as the benefits in democratic countries?  In the democratic countries in America and Europe, trillions of dollars will be printed. I‚Äôm an American taxpayer. And I understand that you need to build new infrastructure. But I‚Äôm not happy to see that the government has a free hand to use my taxes, basically to devalue [the dollar].  So I think it‚Äôs very important that technology would offer me an opportunity to fight back, to protect my hard-earned fortune. And I think that bitcoin ‚Äì which I believe is online gold ‚Äì and other cryptocurrencies are the way to the future. I‚Äôm not a financial expert, but I would not be surprised if, I would not be surprised if, in 10 years‚Äô time, the dollar will be replaced by the basket of coins as a standard.  I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs safe to say you own bitcoin?  I‚Äôm a great believer in the future of coins.  I suppose if you believe that, then it would almost be foolish not to be buying bitcoin?  Yes.  Thoughts on the future of bitcoin?  Well, I think bitcoin will remain as a standard. But of course it cannot stay alone. So that‚Äôs why you have more coins coming in. It‚Äôs a natural process. Now we have thousands and thousands of coins. It‚Äôs like the dot-com bubble; 99.9% will be gone. But those that survive will become the Googles of the world. I‚Äôm not here to judge which one, but there will be few that will survive ‚Äì that‚Äôs why I said basket of coins.  In the past, your championing of human rights has gotten you in trouble with the Russian authorities. Given that background, are you concerned that your support for cryptocurrency can get you in hot water?  Well, this is definitely a no. [In the past,] I was in hot water. To give you an idea, one of the NFTs is a picture of my first arrest in Russia. So it‚Äôs all reflected in my NFT. Look, this is much less perilous than to attack Putin directly.  I grew up in the Soviet Union, and learned from my mother and my teacher the motto of Soviet dissidents, ‚ÄúDo what you must, and so be it.‚Äù And I believe that supporting crypto is an important part of my contribution to the future of humanity. And, again, I [view it] as a much less risky endeavor than speaking publicly about Putin or other dictators.  Read more: Most Influential 2021: Sam Bankman-Fried - Jeff Wilser  How would you describe your NFT project?  I don‚Äôt pretend to be a great expert in NFTs, but I‚Äôm not aware of anything similar that exists. It‚Äôs a collection of 30-plus NFTs that are related to special events in my life and special people in my life. This is a story that connects you to very personal moments. Every NFT has a video message.  It‚Äôs all connected to the physical assets, like my notebooks from the 1970s. Thanks to my late mother, who preserved this archive, you can actually look at me scribbling in 1973.  The NFTs all reflect the moments of me growing up, learning from my mother and from my teachers, and then fighting for the title, and then shifting my life and moving into human rights and computers.  Interesting. This feels almost like a memoir, in a sense. I‚Äôve worked with CEOs before to collaborate on their memoirs and one thing I‚Äôve found is that the process can almost be emotional, or even a bit therapeutic. Did you have any sense of that?  The whole story starts from a very emotional moment, though it‚Äôs a tragic one. My mother died on Christmas Day last year, from COVID-19. And I couldn‚Äôt be next to her, and that was a really big blow because we were so close.  While she was alive, I didn‚Äôt even know that she preserved all these archives. She was not happy to talk about the past. That‚Äôs why I [held off] on any major publication that would highlight [the past]. I wrote two books, but not the one that could tell everything.  After she died, I thought it would be right for me [to honor] her memory to actually start doing things. I‚Äôm doing a documentary now; it‚Äôs in Russian. The first segment will be ready early next year. And I hope I can cover my entire chess career, and it‚Äôs for her. It‚Äôs dedicated for her. And this [NFT] project was inspired by this tragedy. I thought it was very important to show my personal life and her connection, and why she was so important.  And so I spoke to 1Kind, and 10% of the sales will go to Kasparov Chess Foundation, and this will be a scholarship under her name for all the great talents raised by single mothers.  Amazing. Congrats on the NFT project and best of luck.

42423605,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2blxh,1649079851,Digihost Becomes First Publicly Traded Miner to Offer Bitcoin Dividend Payments,"Digihost (DGHI) became the first publicly traded crypto miner to offer shareholders the option to get dividend payments in bitcoin (BTC), starting from the third quarter of this year.  The company‚Äôs first dividend will be 10% of its net income during the third quarter of 2022. Shareholders will have the option to get paid in either bitcoin or cash, the miner said in a statement on Monday.  The rest of Digihost‚Äôs net income will be reinvested to fund future business requirements and opportunities.  ‚ÄúThe Board of Directors of Digihost is pleased to announce our decision to become the first public company in the crypto mining space to implement a dividend policy payable in BTC to its shareholders,‚Äù said CEO and chairman Michel Amar in the statement.  The decision comes as publicly traded miners are looking to diversify their business model to create additional shareholder value, rather than just holding onto their bitcoins in their balance sheet.  For 2022, the company said it expects an average hashrate of 1.5 exahash per second (EH/s), which is about a 5.5 times increase compared to its 2021 average hashrate. Currently, the miner's hashrate is 1 EH/s and it mines 4.25 bitcoins per day.  The miner also said it mined 186.8 bitcoin in the first quarter, an increase of about 78% from the same time period last year.  At the time of writing, Digihost shares were up over 5% in early trading. Its shares have fallen about 27% this year, while bitcoin fell 3.6%.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/04/digihost-becomes-first-publicly-traded-miner-to-offer-bitcoin-dividend-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a71e400595f23cf95b2a3edb0f2753ded8fe5701-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin trades flat, dollar index rises as Fed fears linger.

And check out the CoinDesk TV show ‚ÄúFirst Mover,‚Äù hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Mati Greenspan, founder and CEO, Quantum Economics.  John Michael Montgomery, senator for U.S. state of Oklahoma, Republican.  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Major cryptocurrencies traded flat while the Neutrino dollar or USDN, an algorithmic stablecoin of the Waves ecosystem, lost its U.S. dollar peg.  Bitcoin was comatose near $46,200 after last week's disappointing price action that saw buyers fail to chew through the 200-day moving average resistance above $48,000.  Early Monday, Adelaide, Australia-based newspaper The Advertiser said On The Run (OTR), operators of 170 BP service stations across South Australia, will begin accepting bitcoin as payment from July. The announcement makes OTR the largest bricks-and-mortar retailer in Australia to accept cryptocurrency and is part of a deal with Singapore-based Crypto.com.  The move will allow customers to pay for fuel in bitcoin! Yes you read it right. The newfound use case in one of the developed economies validates the idea of the crypto market leader eventually taking a more significant role in the global economy, perhaps replacing the dollar in the prevalent petro-dollar setup, where U.S. dollars are paid to oil-exporting countries.  ""This adds more weight to the idea of bitcoin becoming a Petro-asset after Putin recently allowed ‚Äòfriendly‚Äô countries to pay for oil in bitcoin,"" Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, said in an email.  Ether (ETH), the native token of Ethereum's blockchain, took a breather after a three-week winning streak, the longest since October 2021. Over the weekend, the options market saw a flurry of activity in the ether $10,000 call option expiring in December.  Arthur Hayes, the founder of crypto spot and derivatives exchange BitMEX, recently joined the bandwagon of observers taking a bullish outlook on ether. ""When the dust settles at year-end, I believe ETH will be trading north of $10,000,"" Hayes said in a blog post called ""Five Ducking Digits"" published Friday. The post-merge cryptocurrency will have the characteristics of a commodity-linked bond and will have an intrinsic yield, he said.  Early Monday, the exploiter behind Ronin‚Äôs unprecedented $625 million bridge attack from last week moved some 1,400 ether to privacy tool Tornado Cash.  The joke cryptocurrency dogecoin (DOGE) jumped 10%. The move higher came after a regulatory filing revealed that Tesla's CEO Elon Musk has a 9.2% stake in social media company Twitter, Inc. (TWTR).  In traditional markets, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, rose for the third straight day as hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed) expectations, elevated crude prices and recession fears kept the world's reserve currency in demand.  Fed fears linger  On Saturday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said the process of reducing the balance sheet could begin at the next meeting, scheduled for May 3-4. The Fed holds around $9 trillion of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities.  The long road to the Fed's balance sheet normalization could be rough for risk assets, including bitcoin and ether. The central bank raised borrowing costs by 25 basis points last month and signaled a continued fight against inflation.  ""As the Fed continues on its path to raise nominal rates and the 2s / 10s curve inverts ‚Äî pointing to a future U.S. recession ‚Äî equities are going to get crushed. And by crushed, I mean down 30% to 50%, until something breaks in the credit markets and the Fed turns back on the money printer,"" BitMEX's Hayes said in a blog post called ""Five Ducking Digits"" published Friday.  ""If I believe this with every fibre of my being, then I must also believe ETH can trade down in USD terms by 30% to 50%. Until either the broad risk asset market crashes, or ETH‚Äôs short-term correlation begins to fall vs. the Nasdaq100 or S&P 500, I will not sell fiat and buy ETH,"" Hayes added.

A sustained move higher in the dollar may put downward pressure on assets priced in the greenback.  According to Kevin Kelly, co-founder and global head of macro strategy at Delphi Digital, the greenback and bitcoin have a pretty inverse correlation.  ""2017 was one of the worst years for the dollar, and that coincided with a huge run in bitcoin,"" Kelly said in an analyst call in March. ""We saw bitcoin run up in early 2021.

42423610,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2bm7h,1649077235,Intel Doubles Down on ESG With Launch of Second-Gen Bitcoin Mining Chips,"Chip giant Intel (INTC) has launched its second-generation bitcoin mining chip, called ‚ÄúIntel Blockscale ASIC,‚Äù which will offer miners more efficient mining rigs than most models available in the market. The move could help mining firms get on the winning side of the environmental, social and governance (ESG) debate that has long roiled the Bitcoin community.  ‚ÄúThe Intel Blockscale ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) is going to play a major role in helping bitcoin mining companies achieve both sustainability and hashrate scaling objectives in the years ahead,‚Äù said Jose Rios, general manager of Intel‚Äôs blockchain group.  Each of the chips will have a hashrate of up to 580 gigahash per second (GH/s) and power efficiency of 26 joules/terahash (J/TH), according to Intel's statement.  ‚ÄúIntel‚Äôs decades of R&D in cryptography, hashing techniques and ultra-low voltage circuits make it possible for blockchain applications to scale their computing power without compromising on sustainability,‚Äù said Balaji Kanigicherla, vice president and general manager of the blockchain unit at Intel.  In February, Intel revealed the details of the first generation of its mining chip at a semiconductor conference. Specifications of the chip, called ‚ÄúBonanza Mine,‚Äù were below top-of-the-line machines of Intel's rivals. At the time, analysts at GlobalBlock said such initiatives by a $200-plus billion technology company would lead to increased mining efficiency and help more institutional investors to enter the sector and more people to adopt bitcoin because their ESG concerns would be allayed.  ESG, particularly the ‚ÄúE‚Äù or environmental part of crypto mining has become one of the main topics of debate in recent times, as miners are rapidly increasing their mining power to stay competitive, which has put their need for energy under the scrutiny of policymakers around the world. In March, the Environmental Conservation Committee of the New York State Assembly voted to move along a proposed law that would ban proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrency mining in the state for two years. Meanwhile, some federal lawmakers led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have scrutinized crypto mining companies for their impact on the climate.  Two weeks ago, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission proposed a regulation that would require publicly traded companies to report information on greenhouse-gas emissions and risks related to climate change, which would affect miners because of their energy consumption. For the most, the mining community welcomed the proposed rule.  Customizable ASICs  The shipments of the new chips will start in the third quarter of this year and Intel hasn't disclosing the pricing yet. Bitcoin miners Argo Blockchain, Hive Blockchain and Griid Infrastructure as well as giant Block (formerly Square) will be among the first customers to receive the new Intel Blockscale ASIC.  In 2023 and beyond, Intel will be working with and supplying prospective customers that share the company‚Äôs sustainability goals, Intel said in its statement.  The chips are designed to be highly customizable and could be used with air-cooled heat management, as well as liquid immersion cooling systems, further helping miners increase hashrate and potentially reduce costs.  ‚ÄúIntel‚Äôs ASIC can be used in a variety of system designs and environments depending how the designer configures their system. There‚Äôs nothing limiting them from being deployed in air-cooled or immersion-cooled environments,‚Äù an Intel spokesperson wrote to CoinDesk in an emailed statement.  On March 7, Hive said that Intel‚Äôs new mining chips have potential to increase the company‚Äôs hashrate by as much as 95% and an original design manufacturer (ODM) will incorporate the Intel chips into an air-cooled mining system.  Tech specs  At first blush, the hashrate of the new chips could be seen as lower than the initial report of up to 135 terahash/second (TH/s). The company, however, said that the hashrate is just for one chip and that several of them could be used to build a mining system with a much higher hashrate.  ‚ÄúThe Intel Blockscale ASIC‚Äôs specs only apply to one unit of the silicon itself, rather than potential output of a fully built system,‚Äù the company‚Äôs spokesperson said. ‚ÄúTypically, mining systems include hundreds of ASICs enabling a much higher hashrate at the system level.""  The 26 J/TH power consumption of the new chip, however, makes it more efficient than one of Bitmain‚Äôs latest models, the Antminer S19 Pro+ Hyd., which delivers a hashrate of 198 TH/s with an efficiency of 27.5 J/TH. The miner is also more efficient than MicrtoBT‚Äôs Whatsminer M30S++, which brings 112 TH/s at an efficiency of 31 J/TH.  A large chipmaker entering the market, rivaling most of the mining rigs in terms of power efficiency, is likely to be seen as positive news by the mining industry, given the chip manufacturing market is still controlled by a small group of companies.  Some of the other key features of the chips include a dedicated Secure Hash Algorithm-256 (SHA-256) ASIC processor, on-chip temperature- and voltage-sensing capabilities, support for up to 256 integrated circuits per chain and reference hardware design and software stack to jump-start customers‚Äô system development, Intel said in the statement.

42423600,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2blph,1649077196,Frax Finance‚Äôs FXS Jumps as Terra Introduces Stablecoin Pool ‚Äò4pool‚Äô,"Frax Finance‚Äôs FXS governance tokens have surged nearly 80% in the past week as Terra developers introduced the ‚Äú4pool‚Äù liquidity pool on stablecoin swap service Curve Finance.  Sentiment among traders increased amid increased utility for FXS tokens. These tokens accrue value from the newly minted FRAX stablecoins and fees from Frax Finance. Frax founder Sam Kazemian said in a tweet that any stablecoin that uses 4Pool for its base liquidity will get direct support from both Terra and Frax.  ""My own personal goal is to make sure any project that holds FRAX is getting more than $1 of value per FRAX,"" Kazemian said in the tweet, suggesting added benefits in the form of rewards and platform support to platforms that use Frax.  FXS traded at $22 on Friday before the proposal was made public. Since then, it surged to as high as $44 on Sunday, before dropping to as low as $37 Monday morning as traders took profits.  FXS had a market capitalization of over $2.2 billion at the time of writing. The token, however, remains nearly 10% below its January highs of $45.71.  What is the 4pool?  4pool is composed of two decentralized stablecoins, UST and Frax‚Äôs FRAX, and two centralized stablecoins, USDC and USDT. It aims to increase the utility of Terra‚Äôs UST stablecoins through a partnership with Frax and Redacted Cartel, a tool for earning yields on locked tokens.  Decentralized, or algorithmic stablecoins, keep their dollar peg based on the value of assets, or a basket of assets that are provided by users, while their centralized counterparts rely on actual fiat backing held by their issuers.  ‚ÄúCurve Finance is more like an algorithmic savings account,‚Äù Kazemian said in another tweet. ‚ÄúThe terms of the savings account? The A factor (aka the peg affinity of your deposits). And gamma (the new v2 pool parameter). This allows anyone to build a ""term sheet for a savings account"" when they create a Curve pool.‚Äù  Depositors on Curve earn annual yields of up to 4% from one of the many pools on the platform. Curve offers a highly efficient way to exchange stablecoins while maintaining low fees and low slippage, according to documents from Curve Finance.  Pools currently deployed on Curve are backed by centralized or decentralized stablecoins, wrapped tokens ‚Äì such as wrapped bitcoin ‚Äì or a basket of various assets. 4pool, however, will bring together UST and FRAX, the two largest decentralized stablecoins with a cumulative backing of over $19.6 billion, and USDT and USDC, the two largest centralized stablecoins, with a cumulative backing of $133 billion.  4pool will initially be tested on the Fantom and Arbitrum networks, and later on Ethereum, according to its developers, with its creators aiming to make it one of the most liquid trading pools on Curve. Curve remains the biggest decentralized finance platform on Ethereum with over $21 billion in value locked.  At the time of this writing, ‚Äútricrypto2‚Äù was the largest Ethereum-based pool on Curve by value locked, holding over $78 million worth of USDT, wrapped bitcoin and wrapped ether.",POSITIVE,USDT,BTC | ETH | LUNA | TRADING | USDT,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/04/frax-finances-fxs-jumps-as-terra-introduces-stablecoin-pool-4pool,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

USDN, which is supposed to maintain a 1:1 ratio with the greenback, fell by more than 15% to $0.83 early Monday morning, according to crypto data provider Messari.  ""The USDN peg started to wobble on March 31 and ... crashed almost 20% as of today, wiping $200 million in the process,"" pseudonymous market expert and Anchor user Duo Nine (Twitter handle @DU09BTC) told CoinDesk. ""Considering the total circulating supply of USDN tokens is 1 billion (with 1 USDN valued at around 0.80 USD), this is a major blow to USDN holders.""  WAVES, an inflationary cryptocurrency offered as a reward for mining blocks on the decentralized, open-source blockchain Waves, slipped 15% to $42.  Users need to lock in WAVES in Neutrino's smart contracts to mint USDN, while USDN redemptions have the opposite effect of destroying the stablecoin to unlock WAVES supply.  Last week, several Twitter handles accused the Waves team of manipulating the price of its native token through its decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Vires.finance. WAVES surged over 200% in March, becoming one of the best performing coins with at least a $1 billion market cap.  Waves CEO Sasha Ivanov dismissed the allegations, accusing Alameda Research of manipulating waves prices and running a hostile media campaign to trigger a panic selling. Alameda was founded by cryptocurrency exchange FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.  On Sunday, Ivanov submitted a new governance proposal, supposedly to keep speculative activities at bay. ""In order to prevent price manipulation and protect the ecosystem I propose to temporary reduce the liquidation threshold for Waves and USDN borrowing to 0.1%. Also, I propose to limit the maximum borrow APR (annual percentage rate) to be 40%,"" the proposal reads.  Crypto Twitter is up in arms against the proposal, calling it an attempt to subvert the system in favor of insiders, and a ""rug pull"" on everyone who used the platform in good faith.  Meanwhile, Vires.finance is losing liquidity amid the controversy.

42423613,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2bmBh,1649073398,Dogecoin Spikes 10% After News of Musk's $3B Stake in Twitter,"Dogecoin‚Äôs DOGE tokens spiked 10% on Monday as Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk was revealed to hold a 9.2% stake in social media company Twitter(TWTR), worth around $2.88 billion.  Data shows that DOGE jumped from $0.143 to over $0.156 several minutes after the reports of Musk‚Äôs stake came out at 10:30 UTC. At the time of writing, prices fell slightly to $0.154.  The bump had a correlated effect on some other meme coins. Shiba Inu‚Äôs SHIB jumped 5% alongside the move in DOGE.  Musk holds more than 73.5 million Twitter shares, valued at over $2.89 billion at current prices as reported.  Musk is one of the most famous backers of cryptocurrencies. His electric car company Tesla reportedly held over $2 billion worth of bitcoin at the end of 2021. Tesla additionally started accepting bitcoin for its cars in 2021 but later ended the project, citing climatic concerns.  Tesla also accepts DOGE payments on its online merchandise store. The news had previously sent prices of DOGE flying 11% in January.  ‚ÄúCryptocurrencies are not companies,‚Äù Mati Greenspan, founder and CEO of Quantum Economics, said on CoinDesk TV's First Mover show on Monday. ‚ÄúYou don't have an earnings sheet or something like that. It's basically the power of the network. And when there's a hype, the network suddenly goes stronger, because there's more attention.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThat basically increases the demand which increases the price,‚Äù Greenspan said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an indirect connection that can be made. If Elon Musk is somewhat steering the machine as far as the communications are concerned, he's going to take any kind of opportunity to push DOGE forward.‚Äù  ""While there seems to be no direct correlation between the Elon Musk and Twitter deal with the DOGE memecoin, the growth is a testament to the tight knitted relationship between Elon Musk and the slew of Dogecoin investors around,"" Alexander Mamasidikov, co-founder of mobile digital bank MinePlex.  ""Dogecoin stands to gain a lot in the near term if Musk utilizes Twitter to further promote the coin as he has been doing, however this time, without the ominous fears of being restricted. Should the buyup momentum be sustained, Dogecoin might break the $0.2 resistance in the near term,"" Mamasidikov added.  Musk has previously lent support to dogecoin development and adoption. Last May, he tweeted that he was working with dogecoin developers to improve system efficiency. That sent dogecoin prices up by 22%.  Then in June, he tweeted it was ‚Äúimportant to support‚Äù a proposal that sought to reduce dogecoin fees ‚Äì one that would make dogecoin more competitive compared to other cryptocurrencies.  UPDATE (April 5, 05:45 UTC): Adds analyst comment in eight and ninth bullet.

42423615,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2bmDh,1649068571,"Post-Merge Ether Will Be a Commodity-Linked Bond, Could Rally to $10K, BitMEX Co-Founder Says","Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of crypto spot and derivatives exchange BitMEX, sees ether (ETH), the token powering Ethereum's blockchain, drawing a five-digit price by the end of the year.  ""When the dust settles at year-end, I believe ETH will be trading north of $10,000,"" Hayes said in a blog post called ""Five Ducking Digits"" published Friday. The post-Merge cryptocurrency will have the characteristics of a commodity-linked bond and will have an intrinsic yield, said Hayes, who plead guilty to violating the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act in January. Hayes and a fellow co-founder were accused of violating the Act by operating with weak anti-money laundering (AML) protocols.  Researchers expect Ethereum's impending merge between the mainnet and the Beacon Chain proof-of-stake system to happen by end of June. Last month, developers successfully launched the testnet. Once the transition to proof-of-stake is complete, users will be able to set aside ‚Äì or stake ‚Äì coins in a cryptocurrency wallet to support network operations in return for newly minted coins.  In other words, the staked ether becomes a revenue-generating asset, similar to a fixed-income security such as a government bond. The non-staked ether would perhaps still have the commodity-like function. Gas is the fee, or pricing value, required to successfully conduct a transaction or execute a contract on the Ethereum blockchain platform and is priced in ether.  ""The ETH 2.0 merge set to occur later this year will completely morph Ethereum into a proof-of-stake (POS) validated blockchain,"" Hayes said. ""The native rewards issued to validators in the form of ETH-based issuance and network fees for staking ETH in validator nodes renders ETH a bond.""  An entity needs to have at least 32 ETH to become a full validator. Per industry experts, annualized ether staking yields are likely to be in the range of 10% to 15%, implying positive returns when adjusted U.S. inflation.  According to Hayes, the classification of ether as a bond could see money managers take on exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency. ""If we can convince the fiduciaries that the classification of ETH is a bond rather than a currency, then a whole new set of fiduciary clowns can be mentally primed to allocate into the ecosystem,"" Hayes noted, adding that fiduciaries can make a carry trade once ETH rests in a bond basket.  A carry trade is a strategy of borrowing at a low-interest rate and investing in an asset that provides a higher rate of return. The trader profits from the spread between the interest rates.  According to Hayes, fiduciaries can borrow U.S. dollars at rates equivalent to Treasury yields to purchase 32 ETH, which will be staked. The entire Treasury yield curve is below 2.5%, according to data provided by charting platform TradingView, which means the cost of getting dollars is significantly less than the forecast staking yields.  The risk is a potential slide in ether's dollar price. That's similar to one associated with local currency bonds ‚Äì where the issuer's domestic currency and the borrowed currency are the same.  However, according to Hayes, for investors to lose money on a five-year ether local currency bond, the token's price would have to decline by nearly 30%, assuming an 11.5% yield ‚Äì the upper end of researcher Justin Drake's estimates. Further, investors can sell a one-year ETH/USD futures contract to hedge the downside risk. ""The broker quoted me a mid-market premium of +6.90%. That means to hedge my local currency ETH bond, I actually RECEIVE income,"" Hayes wrote.  ""I sell the ETH/USD forward at a premium to spot. This is a positive carry trade. There are very few trades in which you get a higher yield investing foreign currency bonds, and the act of hedging back into your home currency actually earns you money,"" he said.  Hayes also argued that more institutions might adopt ether following the merge because the proof-of-stake mechanism is considered more environmentally friendly than the supposedly energy-intensive proof-of-work mechanism.  ""This fact [ETH's post-merge bond-like appeal], paired with ETH 2.0‚Äôs [environment, social, government]-compliant label (another stamp of intellectual ossification), and protocol metrics that are more attractive than the cadre of layer 1 [or base] ‚Äúethereum killers‚Äù makes ETH supremely undervalued on a relative basis vs. Bitcoin, fiat and other [layer 1] competitors,"" Hayes said, adding that MicroStrategy (MSTR) should issue debt and purchase ether instead of bitcoin (BTC).  Ether's options market has seen increased activity in higher strike call options in the wake of Hayes' bullish forecast. According to Patrick Chu, director of institutional sales and trading at over-the-counter tech platform Paradigm, about 7,000 contracts of the $10,000 ether December expiry call options changed hands over the weekend.  A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market.  Ether was last trading near $3,480, down 1% on the day, CoinDesk data show.

42423596,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2bllh,1649068457,Musk Takes Nearly $3B Stake in Twitter; DOGE Spikes,"Elon Musk has taken a 9.2% stake in social media company Twitter (TWTR), according to a regulatory filling on Monday. Musk purchased 73,486,938 of common stock in the social media company, according to the filing. Based on Twitter's last closing price of $39.31, the stake would be worth $2.89 billion.  Musk, the CEO of electric-car maker Tesla (TSLA), is a staunch backer of cryptocurrencies and often uses Twitter to publicly announce his views on crypto.  Foreshadowing or planned action?  In a March 25 Twitter poll, Musk had asked users whether they believe the platform adheres to the free speech principle because he believes it is essential to the functioning of a democracy. He also said the results of this poll would be vital.  Over 70% of respondents voted ""no,"" implying they do not think the platform adheres to the free speech principle. Musk later asked users if a new social media platform is needed.  In an analyst note released on Monday after the news, Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities wrote that it ""looks like Elon has his eyes laser set on Twitter and we would expect this passive stake as just the start of broader conversations with the Twitter board/management that could ultimately lead to an active stake and a potential more aggressive ownership role of Twitter.""  Meme coins spike along with shares  Prices of meme coin dogecoin (DOGE) jumped almost 10% several minutes after the news of Musk's stake. SHIB rose 5%, following DOGE's lead.  Data shows DOGE jumped from $0.143 to over $0.156 several minutes after the reports of Musk‚Äôs stake at 10:30 UTC (6:30 a.m. ET). At the time of writing, the price fell slightly to $0.154.  Shares of Twitter jumped almost 20% to $47.20, while shares of Tesla were up almost 1% in pre-market trading.  Bloomberg had earlier reported on the stake.  The Elon Effect  Musk is no stranger to sending both traditional and crypto markets into a tizzy with his tweets. Previous comments have sent prices of several meme coins and bitcoin (BTC) skywards.  His electric car company, Tesla, held roughly $2 billion worth of bitcoin at the end of 2021. Tesla started accepting bitcoin for its cars in 2021, but later ended the project, citing climate concerns.  Tesla also accepts DOGE payments on its online merchandise store. The news had previously sent prices of DOGE flying 11% in January. Musk also lent support to dogecoin development and adoption. A May 2021 tweet saw Musk state he was working with dogecoin developers to improve system efficiency. That sent dogecoin prices flying by 22%.  Then in March, prices of DOGE jumped 10% after Musk said in a tweet that he is not selling his crypto holdings, which includes DOGE.

This trend line kept the AXS market in suspense from November 2021. Buyers were able to test the first target we expected - the $70 mark range. It was this range that stopped the local counterattack of buyers at the end of January 2022 and did not allow to develop a new growth wave. The situation on the market was changed by one weekly candle from 22 March. https://www.tradingview.com/x/o9uPyZBq/ During this trading week, buyers raised the AXS price by 40%. They managed to do it without much effort. This can be seen by the trading volumes. The trading week of 28 March is not as effective as the previous ones. The weekly candle did not close at the range of $70. Therefore, the chances for buyers to continue to grow to the first target of $86 are still low. In the event of a slowdown in the AXS price near the $70 mark for several weeks, investors will have a chance to buy this cryptocurrency near the $49 mark. Such a purchase will be quite safe, given the risks and likely prospects for AXS growth. But, so far such a scenario is an alternative for us.

Furthermore, the higher price rejection candles at this resistance suggested that the sellers defend this level with vigor. However, the rebound rally from the 20-day EMA undermined the sellers&apos; pressure and now challenges the overhead resistance(23.3).

The main wallet that holds stolen funds still has in excess of 173,000 ETH, valued at over $607 million, at writing time.  Tornado enhances the privacy of transactions by breaking the on-chain link between a source and a destination address. This allows exploiters and hackers to mask their addresses while withdrawing illicitly gained funds.  Several thousands of ether had previously been moved to other wallets, data apparently shows. Those transactions ranged from 1 ETH to over 10 ETH.

Should you sell before fallout? Key technical points: ICX prices have decreased 6.25% in the past 24 hours. The 200-day EMA rejects the bullish rally. Finally, the 24-hour trading volume of Icon is $32.75 Million, marking a 60% fall. Past Performance of ICX ICX coin price started a phenomenal bullish rally with the demand surging at the 50-day EMA. The coin price surpassed the $1 mark and the 100-day EMA with the 40% rally last fortnight. However, the buying spree failed to surpass the 200-day EMA resulting in the retracement to the psychological barrier of $1. Source-Tradingview ICX Technical Analysis ICX coin price action forms bearish engulfing candlesticks, undermining the lower price rejection that met near the 100-day EMA. Hence, the fallout of $1 seems imminent and teases a selling opportunity. The crucial daily EMAs (50, 100, and 200-days) maintain a bearish alignment and significant spread among the EMAs. Moreover, the rejection from the 200-day EMA might shortly test the 100-day EMA.

42410892,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggt3KH,1649048400,Europe's CBDC Designers Wrestle With Privacy Issues,"Privacy appears to be dropping down on the priority list of those designing a new digital euro, and experts are warning that the design choices being made could make privacy harder to achieve.  There have been no formal policy decisions about whether to issue the euro in a new, digital format, but there‚Äôs clearly momentum behind the idea. Euro finance ministers will discuss the issue on Monday, and a consultation is due from the European Commission imminently, a likely precursor to new laws.  Ensuring that a digital euro safeguards privacy emerged as the No. 1 issue in a consultation the European Central Bank carried out last year. Understandably so, as data about spending habits could reveal sensitive details about a person‚Äôs lifestyle, tastes and political leanings.  But privacy concerns don‚Äôt seem to be a sacred cow anymore. More recent ECB research, this time based on discussions with panels of EU citizens, emphasizes other, competing concerns people might have, such as security and universal acceptance, and ECB board member Fabio Panetta now speaks of a ‚Äútrade-off‚Äù among those goals.  Finance ministers from the currency zone are also set to give their views at a meeting next week, and they are unlikely to want new kinds of financial secrecy undermining anti-money laundering and tax evasion norms.  A fully anonymous digital currency would raise ‚Äúserious concerns,‚Äù says the internal policy paper that will form the basis of their discussion and that was seen by CoinDesk.  That fits with the trend seen in conventional cryptocurrency markets, where national governments ‚Äì and, as of Thursday, the European Parliament ‚Äì have been keen to bring in customer identity checks for even small bitcoin payments, despite industry complaints about invading privacy.  Questions about privacy  According to the policy paper, the ECB would have access to data about transactions to the extent necessary to fulfill its functions, such as settling payments and carrying out financial oversight, but the paper said that the trove of payment data shouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúfully visible‚Äù to any central entity.  Panetta has brushed away concerns over state snooping, telling the European Parliament‚Äôs Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee on Wednesday that the ECB has ‚Äúno commercial interest in use of this data,‚Äù and ‚Äúwill respect until the last comma‚Äù privacy laws ‚Äì unlike, he suggested, companies that are just looking to make a profit.  He also argued that details of how much privacy to offer ‚Äì like whether to offer carve-outs allowing small payments to remain secret and offline ‚Äì remain matters for governments and lawmakers to decide, not central bankers, saying that ‚Äúprivacy ‚Ä¶ is not a technical issue; this is a political issue.‚Äù  But experts have criticized his characterization, and warned that overly centralized systems might make meaningful privacy much harder to achieve.  Marina Niforos, an affiliate professor at the business school HEC Paris, told CoinDesk she rejects Panetta‚Äôs claim that privacy concerns are related only to profit-driven, commercial use of data and said people would be right to worry about governments amassing so much control over data.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen, in other jurisdictions, a sovereign concentrating that kind of power may not only be for a benign purpose,‚Äù said Niforos, a crypto tech expert who has previously contributed to the EU Blockchain Observatory on the digital euro‚Äôs design.  State actors ‚Äúhave less commercial motivations, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that there‚Äôs not a danger of misappropriation and misuse of that data,‚Äù she said.  What‚Äôs more, privacy controls can‚Äôt be added just on on a policymaker‚Äôs whim, but may depend on the kind of technology that is picked.  Distributed blockchain technology ‚Äúmight ultimately be the only solution left, in terms of being able to embed privacy by design‚Äù into the digital euro, Niforos said.  That echoes a warning from a March report produced by the EU Blockchain Observatory, a body sponsored by the European Commission to make recommendations for the role the EU can play in the Web 3 technology. That report said that unduly centralized CBDCs would mean central banks ‚Äúundertaking mass surveillance on a scale that raises profound privacy concerns,‚Äù and offer a ‚Äúhoneypot‚Äù of information to tempt spies and other malicious actors.  Yet Niforos also warns there are plenty of open questions and gray areas that might make the ECB reticent to opt for that more decentralized approach. ‚ÄúBlockchain as a technology itself faces several issues‚Äù and lacks ‚Äúmuch-needed clarity from a regulatory and legal perspective,‚Äù she said.  Centralized control  Panetta does indeed seem to be flirting with a centralized model in which citizens‚Äô assets would be held in accounts at the central bank, rather than a more distributed system where tokens flow relatively freely.  In his remarks on Wednesday, Panetta fretted over the ‚Äúundesirable implications‚Äù of letting foreigners get their hands on large quantities of digital euros ‚Äì something that would be impossible to avoid in a more distributed model.  Yet the account-based solution he apparently favors ‚Äúwould come with a set of different problems,‚Äù Niforos said.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a panacea. It requires serious reengineering of the way that the ecosystem is set up,‚Äù she added, warning that banking and regulatory systems in some countries just aren‚Äôt prepared.  The ECB‚Äôs own study shows that many people don‚Äôt realize what a digital euro is, or why you would bother to have it, and that‚Äôs already a major obstacle for Panetta to overcome. For others, that apathy veers into downright concern about damage to the EU crypto world.  ‚ÄúFor the moment, we perceive it [the digital euro] more as a threat than an opportunity,‚Äù Faustine Fleuret, CEO of French crypto industry lobby group ADAN, told CoinDesk.  Fleuret said the digital euro plan could undermine innovation, because it could end up supplanting, rather than complementing, euro stablecoins, without the flexible protocols needed to support decentralized finance.  Central bankers rushed into issuing their own digital currencies when they saw the threat posed by the industry-backed, and now defunct, Libra project.  In the push to stop the likes of Meta Platforms (Facebook's parent company) muscling in on their patch, some worry the ECB could be about to damage, not just people‚Äôs privacy, but innovation in the EU.
