42399133,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiSVB,1468275538,Bitcoin Investment Trust and Genesis Trading Settle With SEC,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a cease-and-desist order against the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) and its authorized participant SecondMarket, the latter of which has been ordered to disgorge roughly $50,000 in a settlement with the agency.  Originally founded by investor and Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert when he was CEO of SecondMarket, the BIT issues shares with a value tied to the value bitcoin, and unrestricted shares of the BIT are quoted on OTCQX. Newly issued shares are restricted and cannot be quoted on OTCQX.  Specifically, the cease-and-desist order relates to a share redemption program conducted in 2014. According to disclosureshttp://grayscale.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/BIT-OTCQX-Information-and-Disclosure-Statement-3-6-15.pdf published last year by Grayscale, the program drew the attention of SEC regulators because the repurchases took place as shares were being created by the trust – in violation of Regulation M, the SEC said in its release today.  As part of its redemption program, SecondMarket repurchased 85,721 shares between 2nd April and 4th September, 2014, the SEC said, earning $51,650.11.  From the SEC  :  ""The SEC’s Rule 101 of Regulation M prohibits distribution participants and their affiliated purchasers from purchasing any security that is the subject of a distribution until after the applicable restricted period. Rule 102 prohibits the same activity by issuers, selling security holders, and their affiliated purchasers.""  The SEC contacted SecondMarket later that month, documents show, and the redemption program was shut down in late October.  The agency noted in its cease-and-desist that SecondMarket relied on outside legal advice prior to the launch of the redemption program, and that this factored into the agency’s decision.  According to the cease-and-desist notice, SecondMarket and the BIT have agreed to abstain from further SEC violations, and SecondMarket will pay the $51,650.11 it earned plus roughly $2,100 in interest.  When reached for comment, Genesis and Bitcoin Investment Trust sought to stress that ""no monetary penalties were assessed"" and that the companies did not ""admit or deny"" any charges.  The full statement from the firms can be found below:  ""As reported earlier today, without admitting or denying, Genesis Global Trading, Inc ('Genesis') and the Bitcoin Investment Trust ('BIT') have agreed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') to settle charges that they violated Rules 101 and 102 of Regulation M. Genesis has agreed to pay disgorgement of $51,650.11 in fees it collected in connection with the implementation of a shareholder redemption program. No monetary penalties were assessed. As noted by the SEC, prior to the implementation of BIT’s shareholder redemption program, Genesis sought and received legal advice regarding the development and implementation of that program. Genesis and BIT are happy to have this matter behind them, and Genesis looks forward to continuing to serve as the authorized participant of the BIT.""  Correction: An original version of this article stated SecondMarket was the issuer of the BIT investment vehicle, not the authorized participant, and that shares represent the value of bitcoins held by the BIT, which was inaccurate.

42399127,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiSSE,1468271364,"'Sin' Activities No Longer Drive Bitcoin Economy, Researchers Find","A soon-to-be-released study centers on evidence that bitcoin’s market has matured to a point where commerce is no longer driven by illicit activities.  Drafted by researchers from the central bank of Germany, University College London and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the paper argues that bitcoin has passed through three distinct phases of growth as a distributed payment system, the most recent and current of which they assert is driven by ""legitimate payments, commerce and services"".  As such, the study sheds light on a key question that the bitcoin network continues to face: whether it should face more scrutiny than other, more established payment networks.  The paper reads:  ""Our results suggest that some recent concerns regarding the use of bitcoin for illegal transactions at the present time might be overstated, and that whatever such transactions may exist could further diminish as the bitcoin economy continues to mature.""  For the study, researchers Paolo Tasca, Shaowen Liu and Adam Hayes sought to de-anonymize a database composed of ""millions"" of pseudonymous bitcoin addresses, which they worked to distill into ""super clusters"" they assert are owned by one entity or managed collectively.  From there, the researchers sought to sort these clusters of addresses into four categories – bitcoin exchanges, gambling services, mining pools and black markets. The report then traces the transaction history between these entities over time, finding that the first two phases of the network were dominated by mining activities and ""sin enterprises"" respectively.  The third and current phase, the report said, is now dominated by legitimate merchants and exchanges.  ""We can thus refer to the first regime as the 'proof of concept' or 'mining-dominated' phase, the second as the 'sin' or 'gambling/black market-dominated' phase, and the third as the 'maturation' or 'exchange-dominated' phase,"" the paper reads.  Notably, the report asserts this has happened even as the number of illicit black market websites has increased in the wake of the shutdown of the original Silk Road, one of the earliest significant drivers of bitcoin commerce.  User behavior  The report also revealed new information about the activities of the entities it was able to identify and classify on the bitcoin network.  For instance, the report found the average gambler bets 0.5 BTC on average, and that these individuals often make multiple bets in the same day. Likewise, the average observable transaction between user-dealers and black market services was 3 BTC.  By comparison, the average transaction between a trader and an exchange, the report said, is for 20 BTC, with traders buying or selling via these services roughly every 11 days.  The researchers told CoinDesk they plan to submit the paper for feedback before publishing it in an academic journal.

42399131,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiSUC,1468259703,SEC Opens Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust Filing for Public Comment,"Investors Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss are another step closer to offering the first Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulated bitcoin investment product following a request for comment published Friday.  Last month, BATS proposed a rule change that would result in the listing and trading of the Winklevoss Bitcoin Shares issued by the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust. Now, in response to that request, SEC assistant secretary Jill Peterson has opened the proposal for comment from the public.  Peterson wrote:  ""In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change.""  According to the SEC, it will approve or disapprove the request within 45 day of its posting on Friday, unless a longer period of up to 90 days is deemed necessary.  The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust was founded three years ago by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss to give accredited investors access to bitcoin, and this is the most recent development from the firm that indicates progress in its effort to gain SEC approval.  After two years of working to get listed under the ""COIN"" symbol on Nasdaq, the investors submitted paperwork last month to officially change their listing exchange to BATS.  No material changes are expected to be made to the rule as a result of the request last week. Rather, BATS is required to submit the form given the specific nature of the offering as an instrument for commodities.

42399119,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiSKM,1468252348,Belgian Regulators Issue Warning About OneCoin Investment Scheme,"A top financial regulator in Belgium has issued a warning about OneCoin, a digital currency product that has frequently drawn fraud accusations.  The notice, published this weekend, states that remarks from promoters that OneCoin has received the institution's tacit approval are ""false and misleading"".  Despite the claims, the Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) said that it had no regulatory powers to speak of in relation to digital currencies, and the note itself constitutes little more than a warning about getting involved with products like OneCoin.  The notice reads:  ""Certain people have recently been promoting OneCoin, said to be a virtual currency based on cryptography, in Belgium. The FSMA wishes to warn the public that OneCoin has not received any form of recognition whatsoever from the FSMA. The same is true of the persons who are promoting OneCoin: They do not hold an authorization or any other form of recognition from the FSMA.""  OneCoin functions with a multi-level marketing system whereby people purchase packages of ""tokens"" that can then be redeemed for access to a ""mining"" platform. OneCoin marketing materials offer significant returns for those who can get others to sign up, a characteristic that invokes so-called pyramid schemes whereby the biggest gains go to those at the top of the structure.  The post goes on to reiterate past warnings about digital currencies as a whole, pointing to cybersecurity and price volatility risks publishes in 2014 and 2015 by the FSMA and the Belgian central bank.  Reports indicate that regulators worldwide have taken notice of pitches like OneCoin and their promises of quick riches.  As reported by Bangladesh news service Bangla Tribune, a group of individuals involved in the promotion of multi-level marketing schemes including OneCoin were arrested in mid-June. The arrests reportedly involved the country’s counter-terrorism forces.  German regulators are also looking into OneCoin. Major German newspaper Der Spiegel reported in early June that the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), the country’s main financial services regulator had opened an investigation.  MLM news site BehindMLM has reported in the past that other regulators in Europe are investigating OneCoin as well.

42399130,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiSX9,1468246290,Bitcoin Price Climbs Over 50% in First Half of 2016,"Bitcoin and ether prices both climbed during the first half of this year, as a number of factors – including rising adoption, yuan devaluation, the 'Brexit' and anticipation surrounding the halving of bitcoin's mining reward – helped the two digital currencies rise in value.  These developments fueled macroeconomic uncertainty, which analysts have identified as providing tailwinds to bitcoin prices. Amid this backdrop, the sentiment of bitcoin traders was positive, according to market data including long-short ratios and other measures of confidence.  While bitcoin prices climbed roughly 56% from 1st January to 1st July, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), this figure lagged behind the 63.8% increase enjoyed during the second half of 2015, and it fell far short of the 622.3% and 740.6% gains bitcoin experienced during the first and second halves of 2013, respectively.  The price fluctuations bitcoin enjoyed in the first six months of this year took place as market participants traded more than 450m BTC, according to Bitcoinity data gathered on 10th July. Chinese exchanges OKCoin and Huobi continued to dominate trading activity, as they accounted for more than 93% of all transactions.  Market sentiment was bullish during the period, as figures provided by full-service bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub show that 66% of positions were long.  Past that, confidence, meaning the percentage by which a particular day’s position sizes were larger than average, was 74% during the six-month time frame.  Ether rising  Bitcoin was not the only digital currency that enjoyed notable gains.  Ether, the digital asset on the ethereum platform, surged from $0.92 on 1st January to $12.42 on 30th June, a gain of roughly 1,250%, Poloniex figures reveal.  The digital currency, which has seen less adoption than bitcoin but seems to be quickly making progress, rose to an all-time high of $21.40 at 05:00 UTC on 17th June, but fell more than 50% to $10.00 by 16:00 UTC the next day.  Ether’s price benefited greatly near the beginning of the year with the release of Homestead, the first ""production version"" of the platform, Arthur Hayes, CEO of bitcoin leveraged trading platform BitMEX, told CoinDesk.  The digital currency enjoyed tailwinds as a result of the ethereum development team delivering a working protocol. ""As it became clear that Homestead would actually be released, the price began rising,"" said Hayes.  ""Ether also benefitted from the bitcoin block size civil war during [the first half of 2016],"" he stated. ""As traders lost faith in the ability of bitcoin to evolve and function properly, they turned to ether.""  But while ether started the year strong, it ran into some challenges later on when distributed organization The DAO, its most visible project, encountered a major security breach.  Since then, members of the ethereum community have been exploring different options for remedying the problem, though no solution seems to have gained a majority mindshare at this time.  Adoption questions  There is evidence bitcoin is enjoying rising adoption along with its price, Joe Lee, founder of founder of derivatives trading platform Magnr, told CoinDesk.  In backing up his assertion, Lee pointed to transaction volume, price stability and a growing number of users.  ""Our analysis shows that the rate of adoption of bitcoin is increasing,” he said. “We are seeing bitcoin's positive network effect increasing in strength as more people decide they want to try out digital currencies. This naturally increases the value to existing users both economically and fundamentally.""  He argued this finding can be seen in transaction volume data. While it took bitcoin a total of six years to hit the milestone of 100 million transactions, the digital currency reached 140 million transactions during the first half of 2016, Lee stated.  Past that, he described rising price stability as ""a reflection of greater adoption"".  Tim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency investment manager EAM, added further insight, emphasizing that while bitcoin was more esoteric when it first came into existence, it has been making inroads into the mainstream. The digital currency is receiving ""more and more publicity,"" he stated.  Still, this sentiment is not without its challengers.  Tim Swanson, director of research for banking consortium R3, for example, has taken issue with the opaque nature of adoption numbers in the industry, and overall lack of visibility on key metrics.  External influences  One development that may have fueled the rising adoption of bitcoin is concerns about yuan devaluation.  The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) sharply devalued the Chinese yuan in August 2015. This move triggered bitcoin’s breakout, said Hayes, as the central bank kept reducing the value of China’s currency over the next 10 months.  Bitcoin benefited from “fears of Chinese savers that their purchasing power would drastically decrease,” he stated. Hayes added that “the PBOC began closing the easy ways through which capital leaves China.”  Another variable that analysts singled out as helping push bitcoin prices higher was the Brexit, when on 23rd June, British voters approved the UK’s departure from the 28-nation European Union.  While more than one expert has pointed to this event as affecting bitcoin prices, Enneking said that it had less of an effect than past macroeconomic events.  For instance, he indicated that events in Greece in 2015 and China in 2013 ""paled in comparison"" to price moves observed as a result of the Brexit.  The halving  In addition to yuan devaluation and the Brexit, one event that generated significant visibility during the first half of 2016 was the halving.  Bitcoin miners compete to create blocks in the blockchain by verifying transactions, and every time a miner generates one of these blocks, it receives a reward. Originally, that reward was 50 BTC, but that amount was cut to 25 BTC in 2012. On 9th July, however, the bitcoin reward was further reduced to 12.5 BTC.  Petar Zivkovski, director of operations for bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, described the upcoming halving as ""the great catalyst"" behind bitcoin's rise this year.  Hayes also identified the halving as playing a key role in bitcoin’s more than 50% climb thus far in 2016.  He emphasized that even though the currency’s community has yet to solve the challenges for scaling the network, these difficulties have been ""overshadowed"" by trading activity ahead of the halving.  Bitcoin’s path forward  Amid this environment, bitcoin seems to be forging a new identity as a reliable safe-haven asset, but market observers provided varying predictions for where the price was likely to go next.  Zivkovski emphasized that while bitcoin has surged more than 50% in 2016, it faces many unresolved technical challenges, which could put pressure on the system through the end of the year.  ""For those reasons, we see a mean reversion play out over the coming months as players look to cash in and late-coming bulls are flushed, with support in the $400s, at which point a pump and dump cycle may start once again,” he said.  Enneking offered a similar forecast, telling CoinDesk that “I think that bitcoin will fall back after the halving, but it will find support above $500.”  In contrast, Lee offered a rosier short-term prediction for the digital currency, stating that he expects bitcoin to finish 2016 at yearly highs of $800.  Note: All figures reflect data from 1st January to 30th June, a period that marks the first six months of 2016.

42399116,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiSHP,1468241419,Bitcoin Scaling Event Set for Third Installment in Italy,"A conference series started as a bid to better unite and focus the bitcoin development community in the wake of serious technical debates will see a third installment in 2016.  Following two meetings in Montreal and Hong Kong last year, Scaling Bitcoin will host its next event in Milan, Italy, from 8th to 9th October, organizers announced over the weekend.  Called ""Scaling Bitcoin 2016: Retarget"", the name is a nod to a part of the bitcoin mining process whereby miners adjust to new difficulties.  The name is apt as the announcement comes as dialogue between members of the digital currency’s ecosystem appears increasingly strained. For example, bitcoin developers and miners, the two most actively involved groups in the scaling debate, are now rumored to be meeting this month to move forward on solutions to boosting bitcoin's transaction capacity.  In an email, organizer Pindar Wong indicated additional details, including conference speakers and topics, would be announced in the coming weeks.
