Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and other major cryptos rise to break from recent bearishness.  Insights: The environment has grown less favorable for crypto in China and India, although the industry still has some reason for optimism in both countries.  Technician's take: BTC's selling pressure has weakened, which could pave the way for a price bounce.

Bitcoin and other major cryptos rise  The world continued to wrestle with rising prices and bad news pouring out Ukraine. But at least bitcoin, ether and other major cryptos had a good Wednesday.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $41,100, up over 2% over the past 24 hours after two weeks of almost straight declines. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was trading at about $3,100, up similarly over the same period. Other cryptos in the CoinDesk top 20 were solidly in the green, with AAVE, GRT and AVAX rising by more than 8% at certain points.  These prices dovetailed with major equity indices, which rose for the trading day, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbing over 2%. Gold, a more risk-off asset, was also up.  Crypto trading was light as investors continued to digest the flood of economic data and events that threaten to ignite a global recession.  Natural gas prices closed at their highest level since 2008. Corn prices reached a 10-year peak. Amazon (AMZN) announced a 5% fuel and inflation surcharge on independent sellers using its packing and shipping services – a first for the online retail giant – starting April 28.  The fee follows similar moves from Walmart (WMT) and ride-share services Uber and Lyft to help offset gas prices. Those prices have had an accelerated climb since the start of Russia's aggression in Ukraine and could continue rising as countries supporting Ukraine's defense look to wean themselves from Russian energy supplies.  Following a visit to Ukraine, the chairmen of three key German parliamentarian committees urged the European Union to halt Russian oil imports as soon as possible, even as the German government has continued to resist such a ban over fears of triggering a recession. Brent crude oil, a widely watched measure of energy prices, rose to nearly $109 per barrel, a roughly 40% increase since the start of the year.  The latest developments damped a few glimmers of hope Tuesday when some economists reported seeing indications that inflation, which has reached a four-decade high of over 8% in the U.S., is topping out.  Crytpo Finance AG head of trading Mike Schwitalla told CoinDesk TV's First Mover show that the market was consolidating. ""it's a quiet market,"" and with the ""macro narrative of rising yields, it's expected, so the market is fading.""  ""The people are losing interest,"" he said. ""You see the media attention is fading.""  Schwitalla described crypto as being in ""a normal market cycle. We're in the broader range of $35,000 to $45,000."" But he warned of ""a potential tail risk"" if events in Ukraine escalate significantly or other problematic events in crypto or otherwise occur.  Markets  S&P 500: 4,446 +1.1%  DJIA: 34,564 +1%  Nasdaq: 13,643 +2%  Gold: $1,978 +0.6%  Insights  A delicate time for crypto in China and India  For all its widening popularity worldwide, cryptocurrency remains in a delicate position in Asia's two largest countries, which have been so important in the industry's rapid growth. In recent months, China and India have created a new environment less nurturing for digital assets by tightening regulation. Their authoritarian-leaning governments do not appreciate crypto's decentralized nature that takes its lead from no one.  Consider this week's main events. On Wednesday, three major Chinese banking groups – the Internet Financial Association, the China Banking Association and the China Securities Association – announced their desire to ""resolutely curb"" the tendencies of non-fungible tokens (NFT) to be made into financial products and securitized, and to limit the risk of illegal financial activities related to the tokens.  In a statement, the three associations said NFTs have the potential to promote ""the digitalization of industries and digital industrialization,"" but warned against financial risks related to hyping the assets, money laundering and other illegal financial activities.  The latest announcement comes amid China's year-long crackdown on bitcoin mining and trading. “We should be more alert and look for potential risks,” according to a statement posted on a Chinese government website last May, adding that the government wanted to ""prevent individual risks from being passed to the whole society.”  China had been the world's crypto mining leader and its investors had been among the world's most active. The crackdown ignited an immediate bitcoin price drop – long since recovered – and re-ordering of the mining industry that continues today.  Wednesday's statement warned that NFTs are not underlying assets like securities or precious metals, and outlined five other guidelines for consumers in considering these assets. The statement also called on consumers to protect themselves by having the ""correct consumption concept,"" resisting speculative investments and staying away from illegal financing activities.  On April 1, just days after its lower house voted the provision into law, India began imposing a 30% tax on crypto tax transactions that doesn't allow offsetting gains with losses from other crypto transactions. A subsequent 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) liability will take effect on July 1. Crypto proponents said the measures impede crypto's progress in the world's second-largest country by population.  According to crypto research firm Crebaco, which analyzed data from CoinMarketCap and the data firm Nomics, crypto trading volumes on India’s major exchanges have nosedived since the 30% tax went into effect. The declines included a 72% drop on WazirX and 52% fall on ZebPay.  ""This has created a new benchmark. It can go further down or sideways but it is unlikely to go back up. It is clear that the new tax has impacted the market negatively,"" Crebaco CEO Sidharth Sogani said. ""The government must look into this ... [B]ecause there is no way to stop this (crypto), the government should embrace the technology.""  Still, not all signs are pointed downward for crypto in the countries.  Despite China's fight against crypto, major firms and even government bodies have continued to issue NFTs. In October, Ant Group and Tencent, two of China's biggest tech companies, renamed their NFT products to ""digital collectibles,"" likely to distance their offerings from NFTs and the associated market hype.  And in India, WazirX founder and CEO Nischal Shetty was optimistic in an interview with CoinDesk shortly after the Indian government passed its crypto tax provisions. Shetty said that the new laws would hurt investors, some of who depended on crypto to survive the pandemic, but he also noted that that discussions were ""ongoing with the government,"" and that the industry had yet to meet directly with policy makers to make a stronger case for crypto. ""Ultimately, technology always emerges, it always wins,"" he said.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Holding Support at $40K; Resistance at $43K-$47K  Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to break above a short-term downtrend as selling pressure wanes.  The $40,000 support level has maintained its status as the midpoint of the three-month-long price range for BTC. Going forward, buyers will need to make a decisive move above $45,000 to maintain the recovery phase.  BTC was up by as much as 4% over the past 24 hours. Over the past week, however, the cryptocurrency is down 4%.  Immediate resistance is seen at $43,000, which could stall the current upswing in price. Still, buyers could remain active toward stronger resistance at $47,000 and $50,966.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is starting to rise from oversold levels, similar to what occurred in late-January and February, which preceded a price bounce.  Further, a countertrend reversal signal appeared earlier today, per the DeMARK indicators, similar to the Jan. 24 signal, which preceded a 30% rally in BTC. Still, a weekly price close above $40,000 is needed to confirm a countertrend reversal.

It has led to a lot of profit-taking on the part of investors that want to avoid incurring more losses in the long term.

Since then, the bitcoin network has come a long way. The demand for bitcoin is at an all-time high as major corporations get their hands on the flagship crypto.

Moreover, 19 million bitcoins have now been mined from the total supply of 21 million bitcoins. That leaves less than 2 million to mine, and given current economic conditions, that amount will be gone soon. Only two million more Bitcoins need to be mined to reach the milestone of 21 million total.

42420982,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXAoxB,1649882386,Buyer of ‘Jack Dorsey Tweet’ NFT Is Out of Prison and Under Fire From Investors,"Sina Estavi, best known for buying the non-fungible token (NFT) of Jack Dorsey’s first-ever tweet, is attempting a comeback after two failed cryptocurrency ventures and nine months in prison – and asking the same investors to trust him again.  Following Estavi’s May 2021 arrest in Iran on charges of “disrupting the economic system,” his CryptoLand exchange folded, leaving customers unable to access their funds, and the price of his Bridge Oracle project’s BRG token tanked. Now out of prison, the Iran-born crypto entrepreneur says he’s trying to make it right with holders of those almost worthless tokens, which were issued on the Tron blockchain.  Last week, Estavi offered to let holders swap those tokens for a new version of BSG running on the Binance Smart Chain. Unlike its namesake token, the new BRG can be sold on several exchanges.  The catch? He wants the original BRG investors to send him their phone numbers and some TRX tokens (the native currency of the Tron network) to verify their holdings. He’ll send them their new tokens within a month or two along with the TRX tokens that were sent for verification, he claims.  “I want the crypto community around the world to support me and for us all to support each other, so that we can continue to be powerful and go further and help the blockchain,” Estavi said in Persian, in one of several interviews with CoinDesk.  Many Bridge Oracle investors said they have their doubts, for numerous reasons. For one thing, Estavi launched and promoted the new token before working out how to repay investors in the old one.  Read more: ‘Jack Dorsey’s First Tweet’ NFT Went on Sale for $48M. It Ended With a Top Bid of Just $280  “This gentleman did not swap a single bridge and started to [list new BRG] in new exchanges,” a Bridge Oracle token (BRG) holder who goes by “Mohamad,” told CoinDesk via the Telegram messaging app, referring to Estavi.  Another reason investors are wary is that, according to them, Estavi did not provide definitive details about the potential swap until after being bombarded with questions about it. The swap was officially announced following last week’s announcement that he had put the Dorsey NFT up for sale.  He listed the digital collectible on the OpenSea market for $48.8 million, more than 16 times what he paid for it last year. As of Wednesday, when the auction ended, the highest bid was a mere $280 and Estavi said he may hold onto the asset.  CoinDesk spoke to at least 10 BRG investors who are waiting to receive new tokens.  “It was more like a promotional show,” said a user who goes by “Farhad,” speaking in Persian of Estavi’s offer. “It seems that there is no swap.”  Anxious investors  A community of BRG holders have banded together in a Telegram group to follow updates on the token and make sure they get their money back. (Few if any are native English speakers.)  Estavi “did not swap our tokens (25,000 holders) on the Tron platform, please support holders, he is misusing [the] crypto environment to get rich,” another BRG holder, who goes by “Taha,” told CoinDesk via a Twitter direct message. Taha said he owns 500,000 old BRG tokens stored at two exchanges.  Estavi told CoinDesk he only asked users for small amounts of TRX, never more than 0.1% of the total number of BRG tokens in a given wallet, to verify their holdings to initiate the swap. An investor who held 290,417 BRG, for example, sent 147 TRX (about $8.70) for the verification. Anyone looking at the Tron blockchain would be able to confirm that the wallet that sent 147 TRX also held 290,417 BRG.  After users started complaining that even 0.1% was too much to ask, Estavi said on April 11 that he’d set a new ceiling in absolute terms: Now users would be asked to send no more than 30 TRX (about $1.80) to verify their BRG holdings. A BRG investor confirmed to CoinDesk that 30 TRX is the new ceiling, and recent transfers to the designated Tron wallet for the swap fall under this threshold.  In a token swap, two parties agree to trade one token for another. One of the parties will give an agreed amount of one asset to the counterparty, and in turn receive a certain amount of the other. Normally, when blockchain projects migrate from one chain to another, swap requests can take up to a few days to process. The period for swapping tokens can vary depending on the rules set by the project involved, and there are some safeguards in place to prevent someone from taking off with users’ funds.  In this case, Estavi says the swap is to be conducted “manually,” by which he means users will receive their new tokens in a month or two.  Read more: Buyer of Jack Dorsey’s First Tweet Reportedly Arrested in Iran  CoinDesk reviewed incoming Tron transfers to the address listed by Estavi and the amounts match the ranges Estavi mentioned.  But the request for TRX tokens to verify holdings of BRG on the Tron network, and the fact that Estavi’s team initially planned to ask users to share their private keys as a method of verifying their holdings, has spooked some investors.  They just want their money back, in some form.  “Consider that we don’t want to ruin the project, we want to get our rights,” said another BRG investor, “Hawk.”  Jail time  Meanwhile, Estavi is once again making headlines after listing Dorsey’s tweet NFT for sale. He pledged 50% of the proceeds from the auction, which was set to end on Wednesday, to charity.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Estavi described his arrest and the trauma of the month he spent in solitary confinement. Estavi insists he has been a “victim of cryptocurrency” but that he’s back and “more powerful” than before.  He also said that he is determined to return funds to his investors. But his splashy return has only enraged some of his original investors and crypto watchdogs.  After Estavi was arrested last year and his assets were seized by Iranian authorities, BRG plummeted, leaving holders with nothing. Customers of his exchange fared no better. In July 2021, CryptoLand investors in Iran reportedly took to the streets to protest the loss of their funds. It is unclear how much money in total was kept on the exchange before it closed.  But after nine months in custody, Estavi was released without explanation, the charges against him seemingly dropped. Since then he has regained access to his social media accounts, and has secured verification badges for his personal Twitter account (which was verified prior to his arrest) and for the account for Bridge Oracle. These badges, also known as blue checks, signal to Twitter users that a well-known user’s account has been verified. They are hard to come by.  Estavi also launched the new BRG token, this time on Binance Smart Chain (whose native token is BNB), to the dismay of original BRG buyers who are still waiting to recoup some of their losses.  NFT celebrity  In March 2021, Estavi purchased the NFT of Dorsey’s tweet for $2.9 million and was suddenly all over the news. He was even interviewed for an article by BBC in which he compared Dorsey’s NFT to Leonardo Da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa.” The NFT was akin to an autographed baseball card or record album; while the tweet was in the public domain, the tokenized version was unique.  On May 17, 2021, according to Estavi, armed officials broke the door to his apartment in Tehran. He was later blindfolded and taken to a prison, Estavi said.  After his arrest, Estavi’s Twitter account was seemingly seized by officials. A tweet stated that ​​“The owner of this media outlet was arrested on charges of disrupting the economic system, by order of the Special Court for Economic Crimes.”  According to data from CoinMarketCap, following the news of Estavi’s arrest the market capitalization of the Tron version of BRG fell from around $1 billion (on May 16) to $38.9 million seven days later and retraced only a fraction of the losses in December after he revealed he was out of prison.  Estavi claims he was at Ward 2A in Tehran’s Evin prison, known as one of the most notorious jails in Iran. He says no physical harm came to him, but he was questioned daily until late into the night, and did not have a lawyer assigned to him.  Teary-eyed during a Zoom call with CoinDesk, Estavi said the experience was emotionally taxing. He recalled the month he spent in a two-by-three meter room in solitary confinement, only being allowed to walk around blindfolded.  “I never want to think about those memories,” Estavi said later in a WhatsApp message.  After six months, Estavi was moved to a public ward in November (which is when he began working on restarting his projects, as his activity on official Telegram accounts for CryptoLand shows). He stayed there for three months, after which he claims he was released and off the hook.  “I could not be charged and I did not commit any crime. Does anyone stay in prison when no one has committed a crime !?” Estavi said on WhatsApp.  CoinDesk was unable to independently verify Estavi’s account of the arrest and time spent in prison. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ (IRGC) Cyber Defense Command did not respond to a request for comment. Its website is no longer working. An in-depth, archived article that originally appeared on the website hints at why the IRGC, a branch of the Iranian Armed Forces, was suspicious of Bridge Oracle. The article refers to Bridge Oracle, in Persian, as “one of the dubious projects that has suffered a lot in various levels of implementation and design” and says the project used “immoral” methods to attract users to various Telegram groups.  The U.S. government has designated the IRGC a foreign terrorist organization and claims the Iranian agency was behind a 2020 “coordinated campaign of identity theft and hacking … in order to steal critical information related to U.S. aerospace and satellite technology and resources.”  Read more: Iran Moves to Restrict Crypto Exchanges Under 'Currency Smuggling' Laws  Estavi’s sudden release has raised eyebrows in some crypto circles.  Mohammad Jorjandi, owner of Webamooz, an independent cybercrime investigator based in Virginia who has been following Estavi’s case for a year, is among members of the Iranian crypto community who have questioned Estavi’s return, including in the Webamooz Telegram channel that has around 450,000 members. Webamooz frequently discusses individuals in the Iranian fintech space who are suspected of shady practices.  Jorjandi, who says he lost access to his own Twitter account for sharing personal information of suspected crypto scammers, shared in the Webamooz chat and to CoinDesk a post that suggested Estavi may have asked a Tehran court to set him free to raise money through the sale of BRG tokens to refund Cryptoland users. Jorjandi did not provide proof that the court allowed Estavi to go free to raise funds.  “I'm not in any side but when he [does] not gives CryptoLand users money back (because he doesn't have or doesn't want to show) but start to sell BRG again it's clear that [the court] let him to bring money from ANYWHERE even [a scam],” Jorjandi said in a written statement.  Jorjandi shared an unverified document, which he said first appeared in a Telegram group of people who lost money in CryptoLand, on the Webamooz Telegram channel. Jorjandi said the document appears to be a letter to a prosecutor and it suggested Estavi sought permission from a local court to list BRG tokens “only on foreign exchanges.” Estavi disputed the document’s authenticity, calling it “a simple paper” that had nothing to do with him.  “You call this a document?” Estavi said in a WhatsApp message, referring to the paper, adding, “I do not accept such a thing.”  Jorjandi also said that Estavi had been an outspoken supporter of former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on his social media channels, which Jorjandi said may have made him an IRGC political target under the moderate government in power at the time of the arrest. Ahmadinejad was a hardline conservative who was known for fiercely defending Iran’s nuclear program as president from 2006 to 2013. Separately, Estavi told CoinDesk that he believes one of the reasons he was arrested may have been because of his popularity on social media and for showing support for Ahmadinejad. Estavi also insisted he is not a “political person.”  Estavi would not discuss the conditions of his release with CoinDesk. But he said he was working on getting his investors their money back on his own volition.  “It is important to me that people get their property and I try to do that,” Estavi said.  Yet, Estavi said that after giving half the proceeds of the potential NFT sale to charity, he wanted to channel the rest to support blockchain projects, and named only one example: his own enterprise, Bridge Oracle.  When asked why he wouldn’t use the proceeds from the NFT sale, which he had expected to total tens of millions, to repay BRG investors, Estavi said: “I repeat this: We are preparing and creating a technical infrastructure for swap tokens. The tokens will be swapped soon.” (The question turned out to be academic, with the highest bid for the NFT only three figures and Estavi now saying he may never sell the asset.)  The much-awaited token swap  On Nov. 13, 2021, Estavi posted the first messages on the CryptoLand Telegram group since his arrest in May 2021. In one voice message, reviewed by CoinDesk, Estavi tells BRG holders to keep their tokens where they are, and that holders will not bear any losses. Hawk took this to mean Estavi will return users their tokens without condition.  But in a later message (originally in Persian), reviewed by CoinDesk, he announced a special airdrop, or giveaway, “in proportion to their BRG assets” but “only for holders and friends who have purchased” the original BRG after the date of his arrest.  Separately, during an Instagram Live session on Feb. 24, 2022, reviewed by CoinDesk, Estavi set the opposite condition for swaps:  “Because of what happened after my imprisonment we have no option but only swapping before my arrest date, this is before May 17, 2021. I’ll not swap after that day because if not, we won’t be able to save the project. Because we want it to be as powerful as it was before. We’re trying to negotiate with exchanges to refund USDT to anyone who purchased BRG after May 17.”  On March 14, 2022, Estavi announced his return to the crypto world in a Twitter post accompanied by a video. That day, the Bridge Oracle Twitter account announced that the BRG token, originally of the Tron network, would be relaunched on the Binance Smart Chain; $5,000 worth of new BRG tokens would be given away to 100 lucky winners, the post said.  Since then, the new BRG token has been listed on at least four separate platforms: BKEX, PancakeSwap, XT.com, Poloniex and BitMart Exchange.  Meanwhile, holders of the original BRG tokens were starting to worry because there was no clear update on whether or how they would be able to swap their old tokens for new ones.  On March 23, 2022, Estavi posted a message on the Bridge Oracle Twitter page with an update on the swap that brought unwelcome news to BRG holders: “I hope you understand that we can not run the previous contract again because of the problems in the past, and we have to do the swap process manually, and this process can be time consuming.”  The post did not specify what the problems were.  Finally, on April 7, 2022, the same day as Estavi’s big announcement about the NFT sale, Bridge Oracle announced on Twitter that the swap was finally happening.  A number of users quickly called attention to potential irregularities in the swap process.  According to Estavi’s post, the Bridge Oracle team has set up a “bot” to add wallets to a swap list, after which the swap is conducted entirely manually. To qualify for the swap, users must first enter a valid phone number. If the bot approves the number, the wallet address that contains the BRG tokens can then be submitted.  If the wallet is successfully added, the bot asks the user to send varying amounts of tron tokens (TRX) to the following address: TZ2DmsPixv8nLEbnxd2hrJ5pFFxF4J7dt6. The requested TRX is to confirm a user has control of the wallet they have added.  According to BRG holders who have been trying to successfully initiate the swap, the amount of TRX they have to send to the address is proportional to the number of BRG held in their wallets.  But unverified screenshots of “swap bot” exchanges circulating via social media among skeptical BRG investors show, for instance, 20,367,369 TRX (worth around $1.2 million U.S.) being requested to “confirm” a wallet containing 3 million BRG, rather than the 3 million TRX ($179,000) one would expect under Estavi’s initial 0.1% formula.  The screenshots that are floating around have alarmed users like Taha, although he has an entirely different problem. He has some 500,000 BRG sitting in two crypto exchanges that he cannot move. Estavi says his team is negotiating with exchanges to get tokens released but did not detail any solutions.  According to data on blockchain browser TronScan, the wallet has already collected just under around 48,000 TRX tokens (around US$2,900). The wallet has only been active for just over a week and a majority of incoming transfers to the wallet occurred after the swap announcement on Twitter. Estavi said the wallet is only being used for managing the token swap.  One investor scoffed at the slow and cumbersome process for the “manual” swap, which falls short of Bridge Oracle’s rhetoric of innovation (its tagline is “Let’s Bridge the Worlds”).  “The method of swapping BRG introduced by [Estavi isn’t] relevant to blockchain!” this investor wrote in a Telegram chat, adding sarcastically: “It’s a new concept!”  When asked if any of them had received any new tokens yet, as part of the swap, one investor, “Shapoor,” replied to the group with: “noooooooooooooooooooo”  Desperate for answers, the BRG investors in the Telegram group with Taha and Hawk also reached out to the exchanges that listed the BRG tokens. One exchange they wrote to was CoinEx which had previously listed the original BRG token on Tron.  “We are sincerely sorry for the inconvenience,” the reply from CoinEx read, adding, “As we have indicated very clearly that due to the inability of the BRG project team offering on-chain transfer of BRG token, the transaction of BRG has been terminated not only on CoinEx but also the whole blockchain.”  CoinEx told CoinDesk via an email that because the original BRG token on Tron was suspended by the BRG project team, there was no way to “deposit/withdraw BRG to/from somewhere.” CoinEx also said it will be paying “close attention to the project.”  Investors also wrote to BKEX, a relatively small crypto exchange registered in the British Virgin Islands, which was flagged by Forbes in 2019 for replicating and publishing Binance’s trading history as its own. BKEX recently listed the new BRG token launched on the Binance Smart Chain. BKEX’s customer service responded to a user saying customers will have to “go to the project party to communicate and deal with it” and that it can’t help with the problem.  BKEX did not respond to a request for comment by press time. In a blog post, BKEX disputed the Forbes article. While thanking Forbes for the coverage, BKEX said that “its understanding of the principles of cryptocurrency trading is still relatively shallow, and it fails to understand the cross-platform arbitrage behavior of institutional traders.”  When asked why he decided to re-launch the BRG token on the Binance Smart Chain, instead of keeping the original on the Tron network, Estavi said it’s because “BNB blockchain is more powerful and more suitable for our work schedule. We started a large project on Oracle and needed a powerful blockchain.”  He said his target market is never Iran and that he works with international standards. On April 8, Estavi announced yet another BRG giveaway on Twitter.

He has reportedly committed $5 million of his own money to a public campaign to make bitcoin (BTC) greener. In collaboration with Greenpeace and other organizations, he is supporting a series of advertisements spanning the month of April, urging bitcoiners to &apos;Change the Code, Not the Climate.&apos; According to Bloomberg, the idea is to pressure the Bitcoin community to switch from power-intensive proof-of-work mining to a proof-of-stake mechanism that requires far less energy. Larsen&apos;s approach appears to be intriguing at first look. The environmental effect of proof-of-work mining is probably Bitcoin&apos;s most significant disadvantage. It is also a persistent impediment to the general public&apos;s understanding of cryptocurrency. For example, rhetoric about environmental damage has contributed to widespread and sometimes misguided animosity toward non-fungible tokens (NFT) in the art world. However, industry experts and onlookers have reacted with skepticism and distrust to Larsen&apos;s efforts. This is due, in part, to the fact that as noble as Larsen&apos;s intention appears to be, the campaign&apos;s proposals are exceedingly risky, totally unrealistic, and maybe even absurd.

Bitcoin (BTC), the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap, returned to above $40,000, while alternative cryptos outperformed. For example, THORChain's RUNE token rallied by 12% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 4% rise in BTC over the same period. AAVE, GRT and AVAX were all up by more than 8% on Wednesday.  Just launched! Sign up for Market Wrap, our daily newsletter explaining what happened today in crypto markets – and why.  Stocks also traded higher on Wednesday while the 10-year Treasury yield pared earlier gains. Still, gold, a traditional safe haven asset, ticked higher, indicating some uncertainty among investors.  In crypto, some buyers have remained on the sidelines despite recent price bounces. ""Investor spending behavior appears to be switching from dominance of loss realization, towards a modest amount of profit taking – 58% of bitcoin transaction volume is currently realizing a profit,"" Glassnode, a crypto data firm, wrote in a blog post.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $41104, +4.47%    ●Ether (ETH): $3090, +3.82%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4447, +1.12%    ●Gold: $1981 per troy ounce, +0.45%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.69%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  No cycle low yet  The chart below shows bitcoin's net unrealized profit/loss indicator (NUPL), which is used by some analysts to spot inflection points in BTC's price.  In theory, the market tends to approach a price low when a majority of BTC traders' positions are in a loss (token price has decreased below cost basis). The opposite is true when BTC trades far above the average traders' cost basis.  Currently, the NUPL indicator is neutral, similar to mid-2018 and mid-2020. The last major cycle high was seen around the January and November 2021 price peaks, which preceded the latest 50% sell-off in BTC's price. A price low, however, has not been triggered, which previously occurred on high volume down moves far below the average traders' cost basis around $30,000-$40,000 BTC.  For now, upside could be limited despite short-term price jumps.

42420971,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXAomr,1649877821,Beyond the Bitcoin Conference Hype: Pleb.Fi Builds Inclusivity,"MIAMI – Last Tuesday, I landed in Miami for Bitcoin Magazine’s Bitcoin Conference 2022, and I hurried over to a blue-collar area outside the city to attend a hackathon put on by Jeremy Rubin, a Bitcoin developer. I arrived at an industrial building where a flimsy sign shepherded me to walk up some stairs and around the corner where I was greeted by 30 to 40 people either furiously coding or watching people code.  Somehow, it was entirely unimpressive, but incredibly interesting. This felt like “Bitcoin.” This was as “cypherpunk” as it gets, because cypherpunks write code. The building was uninspiring. It was barebones and there were random items strewn about.  The event I was there to cover is called pleb.fi – the “pleb” being a one-syllable version of the word “plebeian” meant to identify regular people who like Bitcoin. Pleb.fi is an event centered around hacking, mentorship, workshops and discussions on how to contribute to improving Bitcoin’s functionality using tools like Sapio (a programming language designed by Rubin that enables Bitcoin smart contracts), Taproot and BIP-119 CheckTemplateVerify.  But the low-key presentation by no means was a measure of its sophistication. The content was highly technical and the proposals that won the event were serious projects. Rubin wrote to me on Twitter that “this sort of event isn't just lip service to an agenda, it's actually becoming an important venue for people to experiment and learn.”  This particular iteration of pleb.fi was two days long and started with a half day’s worth of presentations. After the presentations, attendees broke up into teams to start the hackathon and competed to create the best Bitcoin functionality project they could, the winner taking home $5,000. Since I showed up on the second day, I had a chance to sit down with Rubin to talk about his event while competitors were building.  Meeting Bitcoin philosophy with action  Rubin shared that pleb.fi is his “love letter to the community … and you can co-sign the letter, but I’m not changing it.” Rubin has contributed to the Bitcoin code and most think that’s enough, but he wants more, saying there’s a “philosophy of inclusivity in Bitcoin, but we now need to meet that philosophy with action.”  That action has come to life through a grant program to help pay for women to attend the event and people who have some sort of obstacle to attend pleb.fi. Taken from the event’s website itself (in comic sans, of all fonts):  note: we had a limited number of scholarships available to support women (with flights/hotels/childcare expense/etc) to be able to attend pleb.fi with thanks to our sponsors. if this applies to you, please fill out the form above! not a woman, but still need some help? let us know in the form and we’ll do what we can!  “If there’s an obstacle, let’s get rid of that,” Rubin said. “Let’s cover travel for people, then let’s see how far we can stretch it. Maybe attendees need a babysitter? Bitcoin is for everyone, but you gotta meet them where they are.”  Rubin’s company Judica donated to the grant fund. So did Trammell Venture Partners, Bakkt, Amanda Fabiano from Galaxy Digital and a handful of others. An employee from one of the companies that donated to the fund (but did not wish to be identified) said it did so for “inclusivity.”  And it seemed to have worked to some degree. At one point I counted eight women out of the 26 competitors in the hackathon. At the end they shared their stories.  A mother of two spoke about how she is a self-taught developer and she was very happy to have been given the chance to participate. Another back-end developer shared that she was excited to find that she was able to contribute to Bitcoin, even though she didn’t have experience in C++, the main programming language of Bitcoin. Yet another said that she was “previously a degen,” but is now fully “inspired to really contribute in more technical ways to Bitcoin because I am capable.”  This small event felt like a big success, and Rubin is looking to build on it. He plans to have a “pleb.fi Potluck,” which will function like the TEDx grassroots initiative. His goal is to publish a guideline that outlines the principles of a pleb.fi event so that events can take place all across the world using the framework.  At the present time, there is a pleb.fi in the works in Los Angeles that Rubin isn’t planning on attending. The hope is that events like this become more common to highlight that while bitcoin is money for your enemies, it’s also money for everybody. No one should feel excluded from Bitcoin.  The last thing Rubin said to me before I walked out to attend the other conference gatherings was: “Let’s get back to building stuff, pleb.”  Yes. Let’s.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | TRADING,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/04/13/beyond-the-bitcoin-conference-hype-plebfi-builds-inclusivity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e6e195f98e07cd0be0b9e2f3d5cf02af387fc730-623x320.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Price Curve Is Once Again Touching The 600-Day MA As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC price has once more dropped down to the 600-day MA support line. A &apos;moving average&apos; (or MA in short) is an analytical tool that averages a given quantity over a specific period of time, and constantly updates itself as time passes and the value of said quantity (the price of Bitcoin in this case) changes. Hence the &apos;moving&apos; in the name. MAs can be quite useful for analysis as they smooth out the price curve by hiding any local random fluctuations. Such short-term ups and downs in the value of BTC generally aren&apos;t relevant to any long-term trend study so MAs are usually employed when looking over large timespans.

The ecosystem&apos;s total value locked (TVL) was over $250 billion by the end of 2021. This was possible through an ever-expanding spectrum of decentralized applications (dApps). Since its inception, Ethereum has been a key player in the market. The motive behind the network is to serve as a foundation for Web3 and the Metaverse. But there&apos;s a catch: Ethereum has a serious scalability problem. There is a hindrance to user experience, and there is a limitation to its widespread adoption by rate limits and the ever-increasing transaction fees. The result of this difficulty of Ethereum to scale is a huge migration to alternative Layer 1 platforms like Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and Polkadot. Despite the popularity of these so-called &apos;eth killers,&apos; Ethereum still controls 54% of the DeFi industry, with $111 billion in TVL. This is mostly owing to the network&apos;s better levels of security and decentralization. Many developers now use &apos;Layer 2″ blockchain technology to help native Ethereum decentralized applications (dApps) scale and serve more users. Layer 2 protocols take several forms. However, they are generally independent blockchains that sit &apos;on top&apos; of Ethereum and offload transaction traffic from the main chain.

It Ended With a Top Bid of Just $280,"A non-fungible token (NFT) of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s first-ever tweet could sell for just under $280. The current owner of the NFT listed it for $48 million last week.  Iranian-born crypto entrepreneur Sina Estavi purchased the NFT for $2.9 million in March 2021. Last Thursday, he announced on Twitter that he wished to sell the NFT, and pledged 50% of its proceeds (which he thought would exceed $25 million) to charity. The auction closed Wednesday, with just seven total offers ranging from 0.09 ETH ($277 at current prices) to 0.0019 ETH (almost $6).

Estavi, whose crypto ventures Bridge Oracle and CryptoLand collapsed following his arrest in Iran last year, is in the middle of relaunching his Bridge Oracle tokens (BRG), which were originally on the Tron blockchain, to the Binance Smart Chain.

42421190,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXgIXN,1649872252,"Cynthia Lummis: Senator, Hodler","The Republican U.S. senator from Wyoming holds plenty of bitcoin (BTC) and may be the crypto industry’s most prominent advocate in Congress. Here’s what she’s thinking for 2022.  The lawmaker has spoken at length about lots of issues on the Senate floor during her first year in the chamber, and her vocal advocacy for the cryptocurrency industry separates her from her peers.  This article is part of Road to Consensus, a series highlighting speakers and the big ideas they will discuss at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more. It originally appeared in CoinDesk's Most Influential 2021 series.  Lummis isn’t the only senator advocating crypto, but may have been the first to disclose her ownership in bitcoin from before even being elected. She introduced a bill that would require the U.S. government to treat distributed ledger technology as a developing technology stack on par with artificial intelligence or biotechnology, called for the removal or amending of language addressing crypto brokers in the bipartisan infrastructure bill and launched a caucus focused on digital currencies and related issues.  Now, the lawmaker is eyeing a far larger project: convincing a bipartisan group of senators to take up crypto issues next year.  “We are working … with other members on a comprehensive bill that we will be rolling out; we anticipate that you will see it before the end of this calendar year,” Lummis told CoinDesk in an interview. “We want to put it out as one big draft file so we can start getting input and feedback from people in the industry, the regulated community as well as the regulatory community.”  Lummis is working with Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), co-founder of the Financial Innovation Caucus, as well as other lawmakers on a draft of the bill, and she expects to enlist more co-sponsors next year when she introduces different parts of the bill to Congress.  It’s a project Lummis has been building up to for some time.  ‘Hodling’ in Congress  While Lummis is new to the U.S. Senate, she has had a long career in Wyoming politics. She represented the state in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2009-2017, and she has served as Wyoming’s treasurer and in the state’s House and Senate.  She has also been invested in bitcoin for a while.  Lummis first bought bitcoin in 2013 when the price was at about $320, she previously told CoinDesk. At the time, she said she had “never sold” her bitcoin, the price of which came close to $70,000 earlier this year and traded at about $46,000 earlier this week.  She hasn’t changed her viewpoint on bitcoin as an asset class.  “I just buy and hold, and I still do. That is my personal choice and investment strategy with regard to bitcoin,” she said.  According to public records, Lummis holds between $100,000 and $350,000 in bitcoin, and purchased more as recently as this past summer.  The idea of bitcoin as an inflation hedge, an asset that can maintain its value independently of the dollar or the global economy, is appealing, Lummis said last year.  “Going back to my store-of-value means of investing and diversifying, I want to have a diversified asset allocation. I want some assets that produce no income to me, but I can hold as a store of value. For someone my age who has other investments that are more vulnerable to our current economy, I am delighted to have one that seems a little bit decoupled from our current economy,” she told CoinDesk at the time.  Educating Congress  The biggest crypto priority for Lummis at present is education, she said. While there is a need for legislation that provides a clear regulatory framework, the biggest issue may just be informing policymakers about the asset class and its technology.  “The challenges still exist to educate members of Congress about digital assets,” Lummis said. “But the need for some statutory framework is growing stronger every day because the advancements in the technology is outstripping the Congress’s ability to really understand and embrace this subject.”  Lawmakers continue to ask questions about digital assets. Recently, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee on which Lummis sits, sent open letters to a number of stablecoin issuers, asking for details about their operations, consumer protection efforts, governance and issuance.  Earlier this year, Sen. Patrick Toomey (R-Pa.), the ranking member on the Banking Committee, solicited feedback from the industry about possible regulations.  Like any bitcoiner who has been down the rabbit hole, Lummis worries she is losing the ability to speak about crypto in a relatable way. When she tries to explain bitcoin to her Senate colleagues, she tends to make it too technical, with wallets, private keys and mining, rather than just explain what bitcoin can do and how it can do it.  “I suspect that I’m getting too far into the weeds,” she said. “I probably need to retool my own thinking about how to engage with people on this subject. We didn’t need to teach people what was going on behind the scenes in credit cards, we just needed to show them you stick it in a device that you swipe or you tap and then you get a bill that itemizes your purchases and you can pay it all in one bill. That’s the simple concept behind a credit card. We need to think of ways that are just as simple to describe the use of cryptocurrencies or digital assets.”  The Financial Innovation Caucus, which Lummis and Sinema started in May, is part of that effort.  The caucus brings in speakers to educate lawmakers, chiefly at the staff level, Lummis said, although some senators have participated in the discussions, as well. Lummis wants to continue the talks next year.  “We’re going to start a series of dinners in January where we can just have both bipartisan [discussions], and in some cases if people want to have more partisan discussions, we can,” she said.  The educational component will also come in the form of speeches on the floor of the Senate, Lummis said, pointing to remarks she made on stablecoins in September.  The goal is to present cryptocurrency as a hedge for investors to protect against financial upheaval or as a tool for underserved communities traditionally locked out of the banking system, rather than as a tool for criminal activity.  “We still hear people talking about cryptocurrency as primarily a criminal enterprise … Nothing could be further from the truth,” she said.  Lummis has already “elevated the conversation” around digital asset regulation, said Albert Forkner, commissioner at the Wyoming Division of Banking.  “I think it’s helpful to continue the education of her colleagues on the Hill. Digital assets, bitcoin … there’s a lot moving quickly, evolving rapidly,” Forkner told CoinDesk.  Engaging Congress  While holding talks with Congress is one facet of Lummis’s long-term plans, passing bills is another thing altogether. Lummis has already had some success: Amendments she introduced to the Endless Frontier Act, a bill targeted at China’s technology developments, were included in the bill when the Senate passed it earlier this year. The House, however, never took up the measure.  Lummis’ efforts, however, fell short with the infrastructure bill. Lummis joined Toomey to introduce a measure that was supported by senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Sinema (among others) to amend language in the bill that broadened the definition of a broker for crypto tax reporting purposes.  While the bill’s sponsors – Sinema, Portman, Susan Collins (R-Maine), Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) – didn’t oppose the amendment, it was blocked by Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) after he was himself blocked from adding an unrelated military funding amendment to the bill.  Lummis has already introduced a bill to try to modify the language before the infrastructure legislation takes effect next year, and she plans to continue to try to change the provision next year. How the crypto industry engages with Congress can have an impact with that effort.  “I can’t speak highly enough of the digital asset industry. During that whole debate, they really came forward, they engaged with their U.S. senators, and they were able to help inform them, and also inform them how significant the digital asset community is,” Lummis said. “And that awareness alone has caused a lot of senators to take the time to learn and engage in this new asset class.”  Ideally, whatever laws Congress ultimately passes will enable crypto businesses to flourish, she said.  “If we get heavy-handed about regulation, we can have a dilatory effect on this industry. So finding the sweet spot between having an understandable [framework] on an innovation sandbox for the industry is going to be the key,” she said. “It’s going to be a challenge, because there still are skeptics out there. [They say] that this industry is not ready for primetime, when in fact, it’s more than ready.”  Personal views  While Lummis’s personal crypto portfolio is solely focused on bitcoin, she has “come to appreciate” newer tools like the Lightning Network as well as stablecoins.  By the same token, she’s now becoming more skeptical about central bank digital currencies, she said.  Still, she intends to spend more time learning about CBDCs next year and discussing the topic with other members of Congress.  Lummis also noted the potential harm that can come from scams in the sector and acknowledged the need for consumer protection.  “For the good of the industry, it’s important that there be some consumer protections to prevent the scams from turning that national asset class sour,” Lummis said. “So I think there’s great advantages if Congress acts responsibly, and is judicious about the manner in which it regulates. I think there’s some great advantages for this industry.”  Forkner, the Wyoming bank regulator, said that while his work at the state level doesn’t directly intersect with Lummis’s efforts at the federal level, simply having her as an advocate can help.  “It helps to have an advocate to reach out to federal regulators, especially with the bank regulators, as you saw in her opinion piece,” he said, referring to an article Lummis wrote for the Wall Street Journal.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/13/cynthia-lummis-senator-hodler,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d0703787b58b53be2a29c8118a939270f0f9c9a-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Socios’ current social token model has a presence in the world of European football, as the company signed a partnership deal with the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), the sport’s governing body, in February. The soccer platform also has deals in place with some of the largest clubs in the sport, including Barcelona, Arsenal, Manchester United and Paris St. Germain.  Unlike in Europe, Socios’ U.S. deals have yet to include the release of any actual tokens, largely because of regulatory concerns. The deals are described by the teams as “multi-platform marketing” agreements that include in-stadium advertising and Socios-driven fan experiences like player meet-and-greets, but no tokens – yet.  “Regulation is not a concern, it’s an educational process,” Alexandre Dreyfus, CEO of Socios, told CoinDesk in an interview. “In most countries in the world, you have a clear regulatory framework; in the U.S. it’s not yet completely clear. Most entities are trying to figure out what is the best path to actually launch a product, and in our case that's what we were doing with the league’s teams.”  The NFL in particular has some of the more confusing rules in place regarding digital assets. The league announced a temporary ban on all crypto and non-fungible token (NFT) deals last September, but loosened its policy in March to include sponsorship deals, but not the promotion of specific cryptocurrencies.  That’s not to say the league or its members have been hands-off of NFTs. The league explored blockchain-based tickets in November, and players like Tom Brady have long been involved in NFT ventures of their own.  Socios has set its sights beyond just football and soccer.  The company announced partnership deals with 24 National Basketball Association teams in October, though a representative told CoinDesk that number is now up to 28.  “Nobody we talk to is against the technology,” Dreyfus said in reference to teams that have yet to test the waters of digital asset partnerships. “It’s a matter of process. Usually, nobody wants to be the first person, but nobody also wants to be the last.”",NEUTRAL,없음,TECHNOLOGY,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/13/nfl-teams-test-the-waters-of-crypto-fan-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23e15255deb3a79c7d9da3c2d95b5aa18af7d581-3894x2596.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394220,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvaStz,1649870727,"Elden Ring Has Outlasted Its Critics, and So Will Bitcoin","The video game industry has been upended this year by the massive success of an open-world role playing game called Elden Ring. The game sold 12 million copies in its first two weeks, numbers Mark Serrels at CNET described as “ludicrous.” The sales are on pace with the bestselling games of all time, titles like Grand Theft Auto 5, Breath of the Wild or Red Dead Redemption 2.  Elden Ring is not just hugely successful, but a huge creative departure from current game-industry norms. It’s the seventh game in a string of titles by developer From Software, all marked by their thoroughly unconventional gameplay and, especially, their experimental approach to storytelling. They’re obscure, challenging and extremely weird. Serrels puts it succinctly: Elden Ring’s success is “like a David Lynch movie somehow pulling in a billion dollars at the box office.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  These earlier games, including the Dark Souls series, were often bashed by the broader gaming public for being “too hard.” The sometimes “toxic” community of Souls players met these critiques with disdain, insisting that players alienated by Souls games just needed to “git gud.” Previous Souls games sold respectable but niche numbers, with lifetime totals ranging from 2-6 million copies.  See also: Skyweaver Is a Great Blockchain Game, and an OK Regular One Too | Opinion  But over the years, From Software refined the experience, making it slightly more accessible in ways that didn’t compromise the core vision. Now, the entire world is hailing them as geniuses. The success of Elden Ring seems poised to transform not just what kind of video games get made, but the entire philosophy of the video game industry.  Ringing any bells?  Yes, welcome to the most cringey of all op-eds: a labored comparison between the infinite complexity of reality and a piece of pop culture. In this case, between cryptocurrency and Elden Ring.  I'm ashamed to find myself mining such hoary tropes. But the parallels between crypto and the Souls games are hard to turn away from. The two epic projects even launched almost simultaneously, with Bitcoin’s genesis block mined in January of 2009, and the first Souls game, Demon’s Souls, released in Japan in February of 2009.  My main points, though, have to do with creativity, purity of vision, “accessibility” and community. The Souls games, like crypto, arrived and thrived over a period when the creative and ideological bankruptcy of the competition was becoming too obvious to ignore. Bitcoin had the 2008 financial crisis, and later rising anxiety about data harvesting by Web 2 operations, as useful examples of its enemies’ malicious intentions and failed ideas. The Souls games quietly stood athwart the trend towards hyper-slick and user-friendly but lifeless AAA games like Call of Duty and, particularly, mind-numbing and cookie-cutter “open world” games like Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed series.  And Elden Ring’s hypersuccess came only after a long and sometimes lonely process of building and experimenting, made possible with the support of a small, dedicated fanbase, in the face of a horde of uncomprehending (dare I say maidenless) critics. And these weren’t people who simply disliked the games and weren’t interested in playing them. They were people who regarded the existence of these games as a threat. Their strangeness was a personal affront, an attack on an entire status-quo worldview.  Again – sound familiar?  In gaming as in crypto, of course, these critics were lashing out from a sense of vulnerability and fear. They sought to expunge what they couldn’t grasp. The clearest example of this is the endless whining from those who wanted the Souls games to add different difficulty modes. But as people have finally figured out with Elden Ring, the Souls games just handle that problem in a fundamentally different way – one that most critics think is a vast improvement over the norm.  This surfeit of fearful ignorance became most painfully obvious after Elden Ring’s success, when a few developers from competing studios took potshots at the game’s design. This included developers who had worked on some of the most creatively bankrupt games of all time – the equivalent of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon calling crypto “worthless” last year.  See also: What Does It Mean to Truly Adopt Bitcoin? | Podcast  That sort of pressure could have led a less self-assured creator than Souls mastermind Hidetaka Miyazaki to compromise their vision, perhaps giving us an Elden Ring with the same pointless collectibles and brain-dead tasks that riddle series like Fallout and The Division. Many, many crypto entities and companies are in fact bending to parallel pressures, compromising the core innovations of crypto in an effort to make products “easier to use” and attract huge user bases. In the process, many have made compromises that will ensure their fate as forgettable afterthoughts to the arc of history, rather than its authors.  But other projects, including but not limited to Bitcoin, have instead pursued their own clear vision. They’ve succeeded long-term not by giving the masses what they think they want, but by creating something nobody knew they needed until it appeared. They’ve stubbornly refused to listen to the sane, reasonable objections of people who don’t see the big picture.  That’s not how you create a gigantic hit right out of the gate. But it is how you build a legacy that outlasts your critics.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,David Z.

Prices are cooling off after distributing in the last two weeks of Q1 2022. Past Performance Currently, the coin is stable versus the USDT and down double digits in the previous trading week. DASH is within a bear continuation pattern following the distribution in early April 2022. DASH Technical Analysis After an extended consolidation from March 23 to April 5, 2022, DASH prices crashed below the $120 support level, reversing from March 2022 highs. As per the candlestick arrangement, sellers are squarely in control as bear candlestick bands along the lower BB, pointing to strong selling pressure. Even though the bear advance was halted on April 12, DASH prices are still within the April 11 bear engulfing bar. Therefore, from volume analysis, every pullback towards $110—or April 11 high—provides an entry for sellers to unload with targets at $90—the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the February lows and March 2022 highs. On the flip side, an encouraging close above $110 may be the basis for more gains in the short term. What to Expect? DASH is cooling off after an 80 percent advance from 2022 lows. Even though sellers have the upper hand in the immediate term, a bounce beyond $110 invalidates the bear outlook.The post DASH Stabilizes Above $100 After Dropping 25% From March 2022 Peaks first appeared on Cry...",NEGATIVE,DASH | USDT,DASH | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/dash-stabilizes-above-100-after-dropping-25-from-march-2022-peaks/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dash-stabilizes-above-100-after-dropping-25-from-march-2022-peaks,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

42423564,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2aiRh,1649869301,A16z Leads $4M Seed Round for Web 3 Recurring Payments Startup,"A new crypto startup called Loop is trying to make Web 3’s payment rails – especially those underpinning newsletters, employee payments and other recurring transactions – a little less anger-inducing for their crypto-paying customers.  The company recently secured $4 million in Andresseen Horowitz-led seed funding, CEO Eleni Steinman told CoinDesk. A former strategist at bloXroute Labs, she’s been building Loop in stealth with co-founder Shane van Coller, also an alum of the mempool-focused company.  They left bloxRoute to solve one of the wallet pain-points that Steinman said is holding Web 3 growth back: recurring payments. A customer of Spotify can set his credit card to auto-pay the monthly fee. But in crypto, h’d need to remember to sign the outbound transaction 12 times a year.  It’s a pain point a bevy of upstart crypto firms have tried to soothe over the years, including MeanFi, Diagonal and Superfluid. Loop is focused only on Ethereum for now.  Recurring payments only get more cumbersome when decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and multisig wallets join the mix, Steinman said. The way crypto wallets work, users must approve outbound transactions every time they pay.  “You can imagine: DAOs trying to pay employees – that’s a recurring payment. Paying back a loan or giving a donation – these are all tasks that are annoying enough when you have one single signer, but when you have a multisig, I mean, that is the worst headache in the world.”  Loop passes the duty of executing payments from users to an automated smart contract. Once given permission, it will automatically withdraw set amounts of crypto from their wallets, saving them the trouble of, for example, re-signing transactions for a $20 newsletter subscription every month.  “So you can tell the contract, ‘Hey, you can take 500 USDC every four weeks.’ And then what the keepers do is they call the function that then goes to the end-user’s wallet and withdraws the funds. But you can only call a function if it’s a valid withdrawal, if the four weeks have passed.”  Such an arrangement might spook security hawks especially in this era of million-dollar crypto hacks. But Steinman said Loop’s smart contracts will hold up against exploitation. Only the counterparty company can withdraw user payments from Loop’s smart contracts, she said. And they're hard-coded without “infinite allowance functions” that might otherwise drain wallets dry.  “No matter what, the contract can never take more from you than that amount,” she said.  In the background  “Alpha customers” are testing Loop’s systems – called “templates” – internally ahead of a public launch targeted for June, Steinman said.  Not that the subscription-paying public will notice what Steinman hopes to be Loop’s seamless integration with “Pay with crypto” checkout buttons across the web. “You probably don't know you’re using us,” she said – that’s by design.  Loop “hasn’t yet committed to a token,” Steinman said, but offering one could help the company decentralize the governance behind its tooling. That would be in keeping with the spirit of decentralization, Steinman said.  A_capital, Alchemy Ventures, CoinList and angel investors including Lauren Stephanian, Pantera’s Paul Veradittakit, Imran Khan and Nansen’s Alex Svanevik participated in the round, a press release said.

Bitcoin was changing hands at below $40,000 earlier in the day, but at around 13:00 UTC (coordinated universal time), the price suddenly jumped above $41,000 in just an hour with high trading volume.  Bitcoin's price is trying to find a support level after it dropped from $43,000 earlier this week.  The move higher followed the stocks markets opening on a positive note, with the Nasdaq up 1.3% and the S&P 500 gaining 0.6%. Sentiment in the equity market is key as bitcoin's correlation with stocks remains at a high level.  Some other popular cryptocurrencies jumped in tandem with bitcoin. Ether (ETH) gained 1.6%, and AVAX, the Avalanche blockchain's token, jumped 4%. Solana (SOL) was down 1.4% at press time.  The consumer price index (CPI) for March rose 8.5% on rapidly increasing energy and food prices. While some economists argue that inflation probably peaked last month, the higher-than-expected number may strengthen the Federal Reserve's resolve to raise interest rates at its next meeting and shrink its balance sheet by as much as $95 billion a month.

42423559,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2aiJh,1649868108,Spread of Sanctions Makes Privacy Tokens the Hot Bet in Crypto Markets,"Privacy tokens – cryptocurrencies that preserve anonymity by obscuring the flow of money across their networks – have been trending upwards over the last 30 days, with some crypto analysts pointing to geopolitical tensions as the catalyst.  Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, said the upward move may be driven by speculation about the imposition of financial sanctions. Privacy tokens make it difficult to work out who sent what to whom, a useful shield if users don’t want anyone tracking or viewing their financial activity.  “We can probably assume that a lot of the sanctions on Russian citizens are forcing them into crypto,” said Greenspan, in an interview with CoinDesk. “If bitcoin itself is not anonymous enough for their specific needs, they may be buying more privacy-centric coins.”  Monero's XMR, the largest privacy token by market capitalization, is up 35% over the last 30 days, compared with bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value, which is up 6% over a 30-day period, according to data from Messari. Monero prides itself on providing a “secure, private, untraceable cryptocurrency that keeps money confidential,” according to its website. Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, published a blog post last week on the top 10 privacy tokens on the platform, with XMR at number 1.  As reported by CoinDesk Tuesday, XMR’s appeal since Russia invaded Ukraine has only grown, according to Lux Thiagarajah, head of trading at BCB Group, a business-to-business provider of banking rails to crypto companies.  “People around the world are beginning to realize that your money is not actually your money if it's held in a financial institution with oversight from the government,"" Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, said in an email with CoinDesk. ""At best, it's someone else's liability to you that you may or may not be able to recover.”  “That is very bullish for stablecoins, bitcoin and privacy tokens that you can own as a bearer asset,” added Dorman.  Is Ukraine crisis propelling crypto market activity?  The European Union recently voted in favor of controversial measures to outlaw anonymous crypto transactions. The move was criticized by many in the industry who said it would invade privacy and stifle innovation.  ""There are two perspectives that are helping to form the narrative of privacy coins,"" said Juan Pellicer, an analyst at IntoTheBlock. ""First, the macro situation with the regulatory pressure on cryptocurrencies held by Russian entities that try to circumvent financial sanctions from the U.S. and EU. And as an extension, the recently approved EU law that tries to improve traceability on coins withdrawn from centralized exchanges.""  So far, it should be noted, there's scant blockchain data showing a major increase in overall cryptocurrency usage due to the Russia-Ukraine war or related sanctions, CoinDesk’s Anna Baydakova reported this week.  Blockchain Analytics firm Crystal Blockchain monitored the hot wallets of the major cryptocurrency exchanges working with the Russian ruble and Ukrainian hryvnia and found no significant fluctuations related to the war and migration.  MASK, the token of the Mask Network, a platform for users to send encrypted messages, cryptocurrencies and dapps, is trading up 14%. The privacy token decred (DCR), which has a market capitalization of $759 million, is also in the green, gaining 9% over the last 30 days.  Another reason for the spike in price for some privacy token protocols is that investors might be moving capital out of sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi) into privacy coins, according to Charles Storry, head of growth at Phuture, a crypto index platform.  Daily active users (DAU) of the top decentralized finance (DeFi) applications has been declining across the board, according to data from Dune Analytics. Storry said that because of this, investors are looking for the next place to get yield and growth.  “Privacy coins could be the next high-growth sector with the right proposals,” he said.  “More capital coming into the sector would suggest an expected new increase in proposals that looks to change the prehistoric legacy of these protocols,” said Storry.  An outlier is zcash (ZEC), the second largest privacy coin by market capitalization, down 5% over the last 30 days.  “While the (Zcash) protocol has had success, the tokenomic model hasn't reflected this for holders,” said Storry. “We've seen a change in legacy crypto applications like MakerDAO with new tokenomic proposals. I foresee a similar thing happening with the privacy coin sector.”  What are privacy tokens?  Privacy tokens differ in terms of technology and also conceptually: Some are blockchains without smart contracts that aim to act as store-of-value asset (similar to bitcoin), whereas others are focusing on smart contracts and having a decentralized finance focus at some point but more private.  The crypto data and analysis firm Messari lists 22 privacy assets.  Says IntoTheBlock's Pellicer: ""Some others differ on the way they understand privacy, by having traceable accounts and amounts by default or not. Others differ in the cryptography used, either cutting-edge algorithms or more battle-tested technology.""",POSITIVE,BTC | XMR,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XMR,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/13/spread-of-sanctions-makes-privacy-tokens-the-hot-bet-in-crypto-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/259191792644945f7e5d47b4883d3fa825273a5c-1280x800.webp?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, so far this issue is disappointing and intriguing. The UNI price continues to move in the black channel of the fall, from March 2021. In the past, a very aggressive and promising altcoin hung in the correction and low trading volumes. The biggest danger for the UNI price is falling and falling below the $8.5 mark. In this case, market participants will see another powerful fall wave with the final target of $5.2. https://www.tradingview.com/x/2hbbNkAx/ Given the unprincipled fall in the price of BTC and the weakness of buyers, this scenario can not be ruled out in any case. Recent UNI 3-week rebound from the $8.5 range was not entirely successful. Yes, a 45% price fall is a good result, but buyers could not fix above the local mark of $11.66, which outlined the newly formed consolidation in the range of $8.36-$11.66. This consolidation can easily last until mid-May. At about this time, a clear medium-term outlook for this cryptocurrency by the end of the year will be clear. But, in our opinion, without the test of the $5.2 mark and the release of critical trading volumes during the fall wave, it is too early to buy this token.

42423565,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2aiTh,1649860531,Ethereum Merge No Longer Expected in June,"After a few weeks of speculation, Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko confirmed in a tweet Tuesday that the long-awaited Ethereum Merge will come later than expected. Instead of June, Beiko said that the network's transition to proof-of-stake is more likely to come “in the few months after.”     Beiko insisted that Ethereum was “in the final chapter of PoW,” but this is yet another in a long string of delays for a project which was slated for completion as far back as 2019.  The update comes after Ethereum passed a major milestone on Monday with the first shadow fork of the Ethereum mainnet – amounting to a dry run of the network’s upcoming shift in consensus mechanisms.  However, according to a tweet last weekend from Ethereum DevOps engineer Parathi Jayanathi, three recent shadow forks of Ethereum's Goerli testnet revealed bugs that still need to be worked out before the update will be ready.  Read more: Ethereum’s ‘Difficulty Bomb’ Timing Hints at an Early Summer Merge  Merge 101  The Merge signifies Ethereum’s shift to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism for securing itself. Today, the network relies on a resource-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) system similar to that of Bitcoin, whereby a decentralized network of computers competes to validate transactions.  Ethereum’s move to PoS, where users reserve the ability to secure the network by “staking” ether, is expected to cut the network's energy costs by 99% and make it easier for Ethereum to scale.  Building out a new consensus mechanism for Ethereum, though, comes with significant complexity. In addition to introducing a host of engineering challenges, Ethereum’s PoS model will add a new set of game theory mechanics to ensure network validators act in good faith.  With billions of dollars on the line, a misstep would be catastrophic for the whole ecosystem.  Shifting Focus to Layer 2  Even after the Merge, Ethereum's high gas fees and relatively slow speeds – which have made the network unusable for many applications – are likely to remain.  Ethereum is at the center of decentralized finance (DeFi), GameFi, and NFTs, but a large number of newer PoS chains are nipping at Ethereum’s heels by offering users faster and cheaper transactions.  The Merge has supplanted Ethereum’s original plans for “Ethereum 2.0,” which included the addition of sharding to improve network throughput by chopping up activity into pieces that can be processed simultaneously. Sharding is still on the Ethereum roadmap, but it was pushed back to 2023 in order to expedite the shift to PoS.  With this in mind, much attention within the Ethereum developer community has shifted to layer 2 rollups like Arbitrum, Optimism and Loopring, which have amassed billions of dollars in total value locked onto their third-party solutions for scaling the Ethereum network.  Even after the Merge, a growing portion of network activity is expected to move over to these layer 2 networks, which process transactions on separate blockchains before bundling them up and passing them back down to the Ethereum base layer.  While Layer 2 solutions each have unique advantages and disadvantages relative to Ethereum, they tend to be much faster and cheaper than the base layer while still containing essential security guarantees.

42411823,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgDIj,1649859457,How to Check Your Ethereum Transaction,"Navigating the Ethereum ecosystem can be confusing if you do not know where to begin. For starters, knowing the fundamentals of Ethereum transactions (particularly how to track them) is a great way to start.  So, if you already know how to send and receive transactions, why not go a step further by deciphering ways to confirm the statuses of your transactions and track the amount you pay in fees?  Why check your Ethereum transactions?  No matter what your interest in cryptocurrency is, it’s more than likely you’ll end up interacting with the Ethereum blockchain at some stage. After all, its ecosystem contains some of the most widely used platforms, tokens and services in the industry.  In light of this, it makes a lot of sense to have a basic understanding of how to keep track of your Ethereum-based activities.  Get to know your confirmation status  On average, it usually takes anywhere from 15 seconds to five minutes to process ETH transactions, depending on the amount you pay as a transaction fee and network congestion at the time.  With the Ethereum blockchain, which is based on proof-of-work, your transaction is first logged in Ethereum’s mempool before being picked up by validators and loaded into the blockchain. Think of the mempool as a waiting room where pending transactions are queued.  Your transaction is completed once a validator enters the data into a block and subsequently adds the block to the blockchain. While this is a given, it is advisable to wait for six additional blocks to be mined and added on top of the block where your transaction was entered. When this happens, your transaction is said to be finalized and irreversible.  Remember that the blockchain is a chain of blocks containing transaction details. In a situation where validators add two blocks to the chain at the exact same time, the blockchain will momentarily split into two. Going forward, the chain that subsequent validators add their newly created blocks to will eventually become valid, while the second block will become orphaned (that is, not accepted into the main chain). Simply put, the longest chain is widely regarded as the main chain or the most valid chain.  By checking the status of your transaction, you can determine whether your transaction is pending or successful. You can also confirm the number of blocks that have been created since your transaction was added to the blockchain.  Get to know the cost of transacting on Ethereum  Ethereum participants must pay to use the network in order to transfer value and create or deploy a smart contract. However, unlike the fixed fee structure we are used to with conventional payment systems, the amount paid to process each transaction largely depends on the number of participants looking to execute transactions at any given time.  If the demand is high, expect the transaction fee to rise in cost. The opposite is the case when demand is low.  That said, checking your transaction details helps keep track of the cost of using the Ethereum network. In addition to this, you can determine when your gas fee is not enough to trigger the confirmation process. This is paramount, knowing fully well that miners tend to prioritize transactions that will fetch them the highest reward.  Read more: What Are Ethereum Gas Fees?  Now that you understand the importance of tracking ETH transactions, it is time to highlight the steps required.  How to track your Ethereum transactions  Depending on the Ethereum-supported crypto wallet you are using, you should be able to access your transaction history.  If this is the case, you will most likely find the status of your transactions, the time they were executed and other basic information. However, for an in-depth analysis, it is advisable to utilize an Ethereum blockchain explorer – the search engine for Ethereum.  Some of the prominent blockchain explorers that you might opt for are:  Etherscan.  Ethplorer.  EthVM.  Regardless of the blockchain explorer you choose, you will need either your public address or the unique identifier of the specific transaction you wish to track. When you have these details, you can head to the Ethereum blockchain explorer of your choice to execute the following steps:  Enter the Transaction ID or public address in the search field of the blockchain explorer and click the “Search” button.  If it was your ETH address you entered, you will be taken to an overview of your wallet activities. From here, you can navigate to the section which houses your transaction history. Subsequently, you can click on transaction IDs/Hashes to access the details of each.  For those that have entered the transaction ID into the search bar, you will be taken to the overview page of the transaction in question.  What can you check on Ethereum blockchain explorers?  There is a lot you can play around with on blockchain explorers. Some of the available data sets include:  Block confirmations: The number of blocks mined since your transaction was confirmed.  Status: This shows whether the transaction is successful or pending.  Timestamp: The date and time the transaction was added to the blockchain.  Transaction fees: The amount paid to the miner or validator as a fee.  Gas limit: This is the maximum amount of energy or gas you are prepared to expend to process the transaction.  Base fees: Here, you will find the lowest fee required to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.  Nonce: This is a number that increases by 1 with each transaction executed on your wallet. Hence, each transaction has a unique nonce.  ETH price: The price of ether at the time the transaction was processed.  What happens if an ether transaction fails?  Remember that one of the benefits of checking transactions is that it allows you to quickly identify when low gas fees delay or truncate your transactions. Such transactions usually remain pending for as long as the gas fees remain below the minimum fees required to interact with Ethereum.  In such scenarios, you can resend the transaction by resubmitting it and upping the accompanying gas fees.  To do this, resubmit the pending transaction and ensure that it carries the same nonce. However, this time around, confirm that your gas fee is high enough to be included by validators. By doing so, you have duplicated the pending transaction and set the fee such that validators would naturally prioritize the most current one.  Since both transactions carry the same nonce, only one (most likely the latest one) will be added to the blockchain.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Andrey Sergeenkov,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/how-to-check-your-ethereum-transaction,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8017c7f5713b95da41c46cc0623368bb861039d7-1784x1338.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423573,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2aihh,1649858420,Tether’s USDT Stablecoin Enters Polkadot Ecosystem With Kusama Launch,"Tether (USDT), the largest of the dollar-pegged stablecoins with a market capitalization of over $80 billion, is launching on Kusama, a system of parallel blockchains that serves as Polkadot’s “canary network.”  Stablecoins are a hot topic right now, with recent news of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, taking an interest in USDC, Tether’s closest rival in terms of circulating supply. (USDC is also slated for deployment within the Polkadot ecosystem.)  The addition of USDT is a milestone for Kusama as it will be later for Polkadot, said Peter Mauric, head of public affairs at Polkadot developer Parity Technologies, since accessibility and interoperability is the overarching goal of the two networks – both of which already have parachain-specific stablecoin projects.  “Different builders and institutions have their own preferences on the tech stack and products they interface with, and there is plenty of room for a variety of options within the crypto ecosystem,” Mauric said in a Telegram message. “Tether’s deployment on Kusama is a clear indication that there is interest in having it available to builders in the Polkadot ecosystem alongside the Polkadot-native options that are launching as well.”  Important protocol upgrades and other innovations always happen first on the Kusama network (a kind of canary in a coalmine) before appearing on the more conservative Polkadot ecosystem. The network is named after the polkadot-inspired artist Yayoi Kusama.  At launch, USDT will have an asset tag that allows Polkadot and Kusama’s rule-operating relay chains to recognize tokens other than their respective native cryptocurrencies, DOT and KSM.  As such, the stablecoin will power transactions on Kusama’s Statemine (equivalent to the Statemint parachain on Polkadot), a so-called “public good parachain” needed for asset deployment and balance-keeping of fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) flowing across the web of blockchains.  Tether’s USDT is also live on Ethereum, Solana, Algorand, EOS, Liquid Network, Omni, Tron and Bitcoin Cash’s Standard Ledger Protocol. Polkadot will join that list soon after Kusama (the Polkadot parachain auctions followed Kusama by a few months).  “Timeline is to be determined but I suspect that this Kusama deployment will serve much of the same ‘canary effect’ we saw in the Polkadot launch process for the relay chain and parachains, as a real world proving ground for the tech before it is ready for production on Polkadot,” said Mauric.",POSITIVE,DOT | USDT,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | USDT | FORKS,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/13/tethers-usdt-stablecoin-enters-polkadot-ecosystem-with-kusama-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5343021689671551fff7462cb0f7787ef4d0d1cb-5760x3840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Mulvaney, also a former Republican congressman from South Carolina and director of the Office of Management and Budget from February 2017 until March 2020, will work with the Swiss startup as it raises money and works to navigate policy developments. The company aims to offer a “fully decentralized compliance layer” on DeFi contracts to meet anti-money laundering controls required by government watchdogs.  “[Astra's tooling] brings crypto and blockchain one step closer to being truly mainstream,” Mulvaney said in an interview with CoinDesk. He said he’d love to be able to use crypto the way he does Apple Pay but first it would have to be tied into the mainstream financial system and “that’s only going to happen if you can check all the regulatory boxes.”  Mulvaney, whose list of government jobs also included stints as acting head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and special envoy to Northern Ireland, was involved with founding the Congressional Blockchain Caucus during his time in the House of Representatives, in the early days of the cryptocurrency movement. In 2020, he joined the advisory board of the Chamber of Digital Commerce.  “Adding him as a strategic adviser will enable Astra Protocol to tap into his expertise across a variety of regulatory environments,"" said Phil Hogan, the former European Commissioner for Trade who leads Astra’s advisory board, in a statement. He also cited Mulvaney’s “lengthy career both as a policymaker and government official.”  Astra, based in Zurich, Switzerland, recently cleared $9 million in a December raise for its ASTRA token, according to the company. Mulvaney said his first job will be to help the startup secure more funding by connecting the company with people he knows in the capital markets.  As a former U.S. diplomat he had known Hogan, who connected him with Astra, Mulvaney said. He was drawn to what he said represents real blockchain infrastructure in an industry in which “real products” can be scarce. However, he hasn’t yet met with the U.S. agencies likely to oversee the industry, and the company hasn’t received any formal assurance its technology will satisfy laws that protect against money laundering.  “I don’t pretend to understand all the technology. I understand the problems it solves,” Mulvaney said. “If you can solve some of those regulatory problems in advance, then you’ve got a product that’s extraordinarily viable.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/04/13/former-trump-aide-mick-mulvaney-tapped-as-astra-protocol-adviser,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42423569,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2aifh,1649858069,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin's 4-Year Halving Cycle May Be Dead,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin is steady as the race among central banks to hike interest rates heats up.  Featured Story: Bitcoin's halving-induced four-year cycle may be dead.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Paul Brody, principal and global innovation leader, EY  Ethan Lou, author of ""Once a Bitcoin Miner""  Mike Schwitalla, head of trading, Crypto Finance  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin (BTC) continued to trade sideways at around $40,000 as the dollar index resumed the uptrend, and the race among central banks to hike interest rates intensified.  The Reserve Bank of New Zealand raised the benchmark rate by 50 basis points to 1.5% during the Asian trading hours, delivering its fourth hike in a row. The case for a 50 basis points interest rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve next month has strengthened in the wake of Tuesday's hotter-than-expected inflation data report. The Bank of Canada is also due for a similar oversized move later this week while the European Central Bank is expected to raise borrowing costs four times within a year, according to Bloomberg.  With so much tightening in the pipeline, the path of least resistance for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, appears to be on the downside. Bitcoin and ether (ETH) options markets are seeing renewed put bias. A put option gives protection against bearish moves.  From a technical analysis point of view, bitcoin looks weak, with the averages in the exponential moving average (EMA) ribbon converging for an eventual bearish signal similar to the one produced before the early December slide.  The cryptocurrency's inability to chart gains following Tuesday's weaker-than-expected core inflation data may be a cause for concern for the bulls. Experts had called the core consumer price index (CPI) data bullish.

However, observers suggest otherwise.  ""BTC [at] $43,000 is pricey for a halving that's two years away, it's simple fundamentals let the price sink for a while,"" one market participant tweeted early this month, while another Twitter handle expressed excitement after noting bitcoin's record of charting meteoric rallies after reward halving.  To the uninitiated, bitcoin's mining reward halving is a programmed code to reduce the pace of supply expansion by 50% every four years. Essentially, the cryptocurrency's monetary policy is on a preset tightening path contradictory to the ever-increasing fiat money supply. That's one of the main reasons the crypto community considers bitcoin a digital gold and an alternative to the U.S. dollar. The impending halving in 2024 will reduce the per block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.  Historically, the halving cycle has comprised a two-year recovery rally ahead of the event, followed by a year-long meteoric run and a 12-month bear market. If the past is a guide, 2021 was supposed to be a bullish year like 2017; bears are to control price action this year, paving the way for a recovery rally next year and a bull run after the 2024 halving.  However, the bull cycle is unlikely to repeat itself, according to Katie Talati, director of research at Arca. ""There are a couple of reasons; the first is that the power of miners has diminished greatly since the last halving,"" Talati told CoinDesk in a Zoom call. ""There is just so little bitcoin being released right now. Back in 2018, the narrative was much more driven by miner influence. That's not the case anymore.""  Glassnode data shows the 30-day average of the number of bitcoin minted currently stands at 900 BTC, worth $35 million – that's just 0.14% of bitcoin's 24-hour trading volume of $24.7 billion. The average stood at over 12,000 BTC 10 years ago, above 4,000 BTC between 2013 and 2016, and above 2,000 BTC before 2020.  Besides, with the availability of miner financing facilities, miners no longer need to sell their rewards or coins received for validating transactions on the blockchain to fund their operations, as was the trend in the early days.  ""The 2021 migration of hashrate to North America accelerated this change by improving miners’ access to sophisticated financing options. The growing number of listed bitcoin mining companies has further boosted access to capital markets,"" CoinDesk's sister company Genesis Global Trading said in a daily newsletter dated Dec. 27. ""With greater funding availability, miners no longer need to sell BTC to fund operations and expansion. This reduces the selling pressure in the market.""  Pipe, a trading platform and technology company valued at $2 billion last year, recently announced a launch of an alternative financing product for bitcoin mining hardware and hosting companies with recurring revenue.  All these factors have made miner flows irrelevant to the market. More importantly, the demand side has strengthened with the entry of institutions and macro traders after the March 2020 crash.  ""There is so much more demand from the traditional world and institutional investors accessing the market that you are just not going to have ... like bottoming out of bitcoin [in 2014 and 2018],"" Arca's Talati noted.  Big firms from traditional markets are hiring crypto talent, ignoring the dour price action. That's in stark contrast to previous bear markets when people left crypto jobs and moved to traditional finance. GoldenTree Asset Management, a New York-based firm with $45 billion under management that added bitcoin to its balance sheet last year, recently hired BlockTower Capital's co-portfolio manager, Avi Felman, as its new head of digital assets trading. That's a positive sign.  ""Today, I am seeing really smart people getting involved"" despite the bear run, Talati said. ""To me, I just don't feel like we are ever going to see that four-year cycle again,"" she quipped.  That does not necessarily mean there won't be a bitcoin bull run and the halving is irrelevant. It's just that the crypto market has matured with several factors influencing valuations, as is the case with traditional markets. So, the four-year halving-focused cycle offering easy money is perhaps dead.

42411830,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgDt6,1649857513,Will We See Another Crypto Winter or Altcoin Season?,"Markets work in mysterious ways.  There are infinite factors, data and information manifested in a single price and its movement. Investors – from the professional analyst to your coworker scrolling Twitter for investment ideas – strive to recognize certain patterns in asset prices to predict where prices are headed.  Seasonality offers a glimmer of hope to investors trying to outsmart the market.  A well-known adage is based on patterns that see stock markets underperform during the summer when traders are on vacation, giving birth to the saying, “sell in May and go away.” There are also people who trade based on the “Santa Claus rally” which predicts the stock market will rise around Christmas and into the first days of the New Year.  Investors can spot calendar effects among precious metals, too. A research paper illustrated that the gold market experiences an ""autumn effect"" and typically rises in September and November.  The outstanding question in cryptocurrency, which is still in its infancy compared to traditional investments, remains: Is there such a thing as seasonality in crypto?  What do 'seasons' mean in crypto?  Investors are perpetually interested in the idea of “timing the market” and discovering patterns and trends to inform their entry and exit points, and crypto investors are no different. Even though the historical data is thin compared to traditional investments, crypto investors have already declared several “seasons.” The most notorious among them are ""altcoin season,"" ""crypto (or Bitcoin) winter,"" and the ""DeFi Summer.""  Altcoin season  Altcoins is a blanket term that includes all cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin such as ether (ETH), XRP, cardano (ADA), and dogecoin (DOGE).  Altcoin season refers to certain times in the market when the prices of alternative cryptocurrencies’ surge relative to bitcoin for many weeks or months.  These events usually happen when bitcoin’s price stalls after a significant rally and investors reallocate their profits to other coins, initiating a new bull market for altcoins.  The best way to recognize an altcoin season is by using the Bitcoin Dominance Index chart, which shows how big of a slice Bitcoin’s total value (market capitalization) is compared to the rest of the crypto market.  Let’s say the Bitcoin Dominance Index stands at 42. This means that Bitcoin’s market share is 42% of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. When the index rises, Bitcoin is gaining ground relative to all the other coins’ market share. A drop in the index indicates the opposite.  A sharp, sustained fall in Bitcoin's dominance for weeks or months is characteristic of an altcoin season.  The first such altcoin seasons happened in the first half of 2017 and early 2018. Before 2017, bitcoin (BTC) represented nine-tenths of the total crypto market with other coins largely remaining on the fringes. Then came the initial coin offering (ICO) craze and the meteoric rise in the prices of then-unknown coins, such as ether (ETH) and xrp (XRP.)  In less than a year’s time, altcoins totaled more than 50% of the cryptocurrency market.  The last altcoin season arrived in the final few weeks of 2020 and lasted until May 2021. During this period, ETH surged from $600 to more than $4,100, while the prices of smaller coins, such as Cardano’s ada (ADA) and Binance’s binance coin (BNB) experienced huge rises (1,300% and 2,000% gains, respectively).  DeFi Summer  The term DeFi Summer was first coined in 2020 when decentralized finance projects – cryptocurrencies that let investors lend, borrow and earn a yield – gained traction by luring investors with high, (and as it turned out) unsustainable yields.  It kicked off a speculative frenzy that grew decentralized finance (DeFi) to a $7 billion market by September 2020.  To date, DeFi Summer was a one-off phenomenon, though the buzz around this new sector revived in late spring of 2021 with many people anticipating a second coming. This was reflected by Google search data at the time, but DeFi Summer 2.0 never came into fruition.  Still, decentralized finance has stayed and matured into its own sector of the digital asset industry, boasting an extensive range of autonomous financial applications, such as loans, insurance, crowdfunding, derivatives and even betting.  Read more: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained  Crypto winter  Crypto winter refers to a prolonged period of falling prices.  The last crypto winter began in early 2018 and saw bitcoin lose over 87% of its value in a year compared to its all-time high in December 2017.  Other cryptocurrencies fell even harder than bitcoin, with a vast majority reporting 90-95% declines from their all-time highs.  When cryptocurrency prices nosedived in May 2021 and then later in the year toward December, many feared we were on the cusp of another dreaded crypto winter.  Read More: Is a Crypto Winter Coming? 3 Things to Consider  Is there a right season to buy crypto?  Past performance isn’t a predictor of future price action, but we can look for patterns and assess probabilities.  Although bitcoin has been around since 2009, price data from its early years does not carry the same weight as more current data. That’s because the market was far too immature to get reliable price data.  Looking at the largest cryptocurrency’s average monthly returns since 2011, bitcoin tends to perform better during some parts of the year than others. Spring and fall months stand out as generally favorable for BTC.  On the other hand, the summer months are somewhat muted, and its price usually closes the month around the same level it started on average. September is historically a bad month for bitcoin, dropping by about 5% on average.  In the case of Ethereum, we work from even fewer data points. Looking at the average monthly return of ETH since April 2016, we see a division between each half of the year.  Ethereum has performed better in the months of the first half of the year, producing its strongest, double-digit average percentage gains in April and May. Monthly returns in the second half of the year are weaker, with June and September averaging a monthly loss.  Read more: How Does Ethereum Staking Work?  The problem with seasons in crypto  Seasonal effects in the traditional markets are real, and there is no shortage of research and academic papers about it.  The key challenge of analyzing any seasonal patterns in the cryptocurrency markets is the lack of historical data.  Equities date back to the first stock exchange market launched in Amsterdam in 1602 to trade shares of the Dutch East India Company.  Debt markets have been around for thousands of years. The first recorded mention of bonds dates back to 2400 B.C. in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq), where the bond guaranteed payment of grains. If the issuer failed to deliver, the amount borrowed was reimbursed.  Even if analysts focus on the recent past, they can work with decades of well-documented information about how asset prices moved within different market conditions.  With crypto markets, the track record is simply too short right now to draw well-founded conclusions.  Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency launched in 2009, only has slightly more than a decade-long history. For the most part, it has only experienced the market conditions of the post-great financial crisis characterized by low interest rates and quantitative easing. Altcoins have an even shorter history to look back at – a few years at best, in some cases.  The psychology behind looking for seasons  There are certain aspects of the human psyche that prevent us from thinking without emotions and making rational investment decisions.  Recency bias  Recency bias is a certain type of cognitive distortion that is a fundamental feature – or bug – in human psychology. It makes people give more importance to the latest events compared to what has happened long ago.  It’s commonplace when it comes to investing, too. Investors tend to overestimate the importance of recent events and believe that they will happen again.  The fact that there was a DeFi Summer or an altcoin season last year does not mean that they should happen periodically or in an orderly fashion.  The danger for investors is if they fixate on the second coming of the DeFi Summer or a single cryptocurrency that pumped this time last year, they might miss new digital assets gaining traction.  Feedback loop  If investors believe the price of an instrument goes up, more and more will want to buy it pushing the price higher. This psychological phenomenon is called herding in behavioral finance.  Take this example, if enough people believe in the narrative that a ""DeFi Summer 2.0"" is around the corner, traders want to get in early to front-run others and buy decentralized finance tokens. Higher demand pushes up the price and reinforces the narrative. Less experienced investors turn their attention to the tokens that surge and jump on the bandwagon, pushing the price even higher. When there aren’t any buyers left in the market, the rally loses steam and the price crashes.  This is what we call a positive feedback loop, and it spirals on until it becomes unsustainable. In extreme conditions, it can lead to asset bubbles, manias and subsequent crashes.  Cryptocurrencies are a young and rapidly growing asset class. Phases of contraction and expansion of an emerging asset class are natural regardless of which page we turn in the calendar.  This doesn’t mean a new altcoin season or a DeFi Summer 2.0 won’t happen. But predicting any “crypto season” right now using past calendar data is a tall order.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/will-we-see-another-crypto-winter-or-altcoin-season,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2f7abc981b614ecc45333b17d4cacd3a2925238a-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This supports the use of digital assets for portfolio diversification, as the factors driving crypto performances are still distinct from those impacting traditional assets, David Duong, head of institutional research, wrote last week.  ""Despite the convergence of geopolitical and policy-related concerns impacting almost all risk assets in recent months, our random forest analysis suggests that the return characteristics of cryptocurrencies tend to be more aligned with idiosyncratic rather than cyclical factors,” the note says.  Duong utilized ""random forests,"" a machine learning algorithm that can be used to identify which variables impact cryptocurrency returns. Coinbase’s analysis shows that crypto-specific features were more relevant when explaining the returns on bitcoin (BTC), Solana’s SOL and Avalanche’s AVAX.  “Tokenomic-linked variables,” such as total value locked and circulating supply, were especially important for cryptocurrencies in early growth stages, such as SOL and AVAX, the report says.  Only ether (ETH) witnessed a rotation away from more heavily ether-centric factors in the middle of last year to more macro-driven sentiment factors in late 2021/early 2022, Coinbase said.  As Ethereum’s mainnet approaches ""the Merge"" in the second quarter, Coinbase expects a “reordering in these relationships to once again favor ether’s tokenomics,” as issuance will be reduced after the merge and staking yields should rise sharply.

42410900,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggt3e7,1649853000,Reminder: The Merge Won’t Solve Ethereum’s Scaling Woes by Itself,"Ethereum supporters have some reason to celebrate this week.  After yet another delay, the Ethereum network took a step closer to “the Merge” with its first Ethereum mainnet “shadow fork” – a successful test run of the network’s eventual transition to proof-of-stake.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  For those new to the wild world of Ethereum, the Merge signifies the network's long-anticipated shift to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism – the method by which a decentralized community of computers works to secure the Ethereum blockchain.  Much has already been written by way of PoS explainers (including by us at CoinDesk); in essence, the transition away from today’s computation-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism is expected to cut the network’s energy costs by 95% and help scale the network.  As excitement continues to mount around Ethereum’s big update, it’s important to remember that it will not immediately solve some of the chain’s most pressing usability problems.  This reminder will be obvious to those who have been following this story closely for a while, but it bears repeating for those newer to the space. Changing roadmaps, confusing terminology (RIP Eth2), and Ethereum market-speak have made it hard to pin down what, exactly, the Merge entails.  In reality, most long-term improvements to Ethereum’s usability will come from its ecosystem, not from updates to the Ethereum network itself.  The Merge vs. Layer 2  The most visible annoyance for users of today’s Ethereum network is high transaction costs. According to Etherscan, activities as simple as buying a non-fungible token (NFT) on OpenSea or swapping between tokens on Uniswap’s decentralized exchange (DEX) currently cost upwards of $30 in gas fees.  These fees are used to reward miners – the computers that compete with one another to secure the Ethereum network via PoW. The more congested Ethereum’s network, the higher the fees.  After the shift to PoS, similar fees will still be required to pay “validators,” who will stake a sum of ether for the privilege of processing transactions.  As many of you will remember, Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake was originally set to accompany another upgrade: “sharding,” which promised to split up the network into pieces in an effort to increase transaction throughput and decrease fees.  But sharding won’t be coming any time soon. In order to expedite the shift to PoS, sharding was postponed until after the Merge and is now slated to come sometime in 2023 (though Ethereum timelines have a way of stretching out).  In the meantime, the focus has shifted away from the Ethereum network itself to layer 2 systems like “rollups,” which scale the Ethereum network off-chain while borrowing its essential security guarantees. An entire layer 2 industry has popped up to scale, or increase capacity on, Ethereum, with leading products such as Arbitrum, Optimism and Loopring allowing users to transact at a fraction of the cost of Ethereum, and attracting billions of dollars in combined total value locked (TVL) as a result.  In discussing a recent update to Arbitrum’s Optimistic rollup system, Steven Goldfeder, the CEO of Arbitrum creator Offchain Labs, reminded me that scaling is a “long-term problem” that won’t be fixed by any single update or improvement.  “It's … sort of almost a cat and mouse game, right? You scale to a point that we can handle the next 100 million users. But then, you know, they come and you say, how do we get the next billion users and 2 billion users and 10 billion users and ultimately, you have to keep advancing,” he explained.  While the Merge will be a massive development for Ethereum that will (among other things) dramatically improve the network’s environmental impact, it will not suddenly fix the primary issues that have left room for faster and cheaper blockchains like Solana to steal much of Ethereum’s thunder.  Even with the eventual introduction of sharding, upgrades on the scale of Ethereum will always take a while, and it will ultimately be innovation from third parties which determines the network’s staying power.

WHY IT MATTERS: The ERC-4626 token standard will improve interoperability between apps that allow users to lock tokens into yield-bearing vaults – a near-ubiquitous feature of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Other popular apps in the Ethereum ecosystem are expected to follow in Yearn’s footsteps in adopting the standard. Read more here.  Gas usage on Ethereum was up 13% in March from the previous month, according to DeFi analytics firm HashEx.  WHY IT MATTERS: The increase in gas fees came as ether’s (ETH) price topped $3,400 at its end of March peak – higher than at any point in February. The rise in fees stands as a reminder that demand for Ethereum block space has continued to grow unabated even as layer 2 chains working to scale the network, like Arbitrum and Optimism, have enjoyed wider adoption. Read more here.  Ethereum’s largest layer 2 rollup chain, Arbitrum, released a major update this week.  WHY IT MATTERS: Arbitrum, an Optimistic rollup, is the leading Ethereum layer 2 chain with over $2 billion total value locked (TVL) according to DeFiLlama. The “Nitro” update promises to halve fees and increase network speeds as competition between Ethereum scaling solutions continues to heat up. (Just a few weeks ago, Arbitrum’s primary competitor in the Optimistic rollup space, Optimism, announced a $150 million series B led by A16z). Read more here.

MetaMask Institutional announced on Wednesday that it has formed partnerships with Gnosis Safe, Hex Trust, GK8 and Parfin to accommodate the crypto custody requirements of DAOs, crypto-native organizations that seek to distribute decision-making among a group of token holders.  With more than 30 million monthly active users, MetaMask is now pushing to become the primary Web 3 gateway for organizations worldwide.  Read more: $450M Raise Values Ethereum Builder ConsenSys at $7B as MetaMask Tops 30M Users  “We are thrilled by our latest custodian announcement as it allows further bolstering and expansion of Web 3 into a variety of different and important regions,” said Harriet Browning, a business development lead for MetaMask Institutional.  “Coupled with the different licensed custodians, custody tech and non-custodial key management solutions means we continue to push towards our vision of bridging all organizations on planet earth into Web 3,” she said.  Enterprise MetaMask  The institutional arm of the ConsenSys-owned wallet was launched in December 2020 by ConsenSys to help crypto funds, market-makers and trading desks get exposure to Ethereum-based applications.  It is different from the traditional MetaMask wallet in that it has a built-in tech stack that connects large organizations with their required custodians. The DeFi ecosystem grew by over 20 times in 2021, according to MetaMask’s website.  With those new integrations, MetaMask Institutional has seven custodians tailored to DAOs in different jurisdictions. In October 2021, the wallet added BitGo, Qredo and Cactus Custody to help firms with compliance requirements.  MetaMask has seen tremendous growth through the acceleration of Web 3 adoption globally, tripling its million monthly user count in the last year. In March, ConsenSys closed a $450 million funding round, with MetaMask and Infura being widely seen as the Ethereum venture studio’s crown jewels.

In the weekly timeframe, the price came to a key liquidity zone of $0.2. This mark confidently withstood the GALA fall in January 2022 and formed a consolidation in the market, which continues to this day. During the 4 trading weeks on 7 March, buyers tried to start the growth wave. This attempt was really unsuccessful. In 4 weeks the GALA price increased by 20%, which for such altcoin is quite possible to achieve in 4 hours. GALA&apos;s lazy growth without volumes shows that buyers are not interested in buying cryptocurrency in the range of $0.2. And this fact indicates a high probability of continuing the downward trend and updating the local low. In this case, investors should prepare for the GALA cryptocurrency test of $0.11. This is the only and closest liquidity level where the common interest of buyers can maximize. However, to sow panic and approve these words as the main scenario is a little early. At the time of writing, sellers have not taken control of the $0.2 mark. Keeping this mark on the weekly timeframe will form a triangular consolidation with a breakdown upwards and a $0.38 test. So while buyers control $0.2 - there is now a good opportunity for a medium-term investment in GALA with low risks and a probable return of 90%.

42395549,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxt63,1649850808,Chinese Banking Associations Target NFTs,"China's Internet Financial Association, the China Banking Association and the China Securities Association want to ""resolutely curb"" the tendencies of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to be made into financial products and securitized and to limit the risk of illegal financial activities related to the tokens, the group said in a statement published Wednesday.  Two of these three self-governing bodies nearly one year ago presaged one of the most stringent crackdowns in China to date when they told their members that they are forbidden from conducting business with crypto companies. Just days later, the State Council – the country's chief administration body – called for a crackdown on crypto mining and trading.  In Wednesday's statement, the three associations said that NFTs have the potential to promote ""the digitalization of industries and digital industrialization,"" but warned against financial risks related to hyping the assets, money laundering and other illegal financial activities.  Chinese authorities have previously called out financial risks resulting from hype and speculative trading as reasons for cracking down on crypto more broadly.  The associations listed six behavioral principles to be followed: NFTs don't represent underlying assets like securities or precious metals; the non-fungibility of the tokens must not be weakened through methods like dividing them so that the distribution mechanism doesn't change; centralized trading shouldn't be provided; pricing and settlement of NFT transactions shouldn't include cryptocurrencies; platforms must perform real-name authentication and anti-money laundering check; financing support for investments in NFTs shouldn't be provided.  Despite China's fight against crypto, NFTs continue to be issued by major firms and even government bodies. In October, Ant Group and Tencent, two of China's biggest tech companies, renamed their NFT products to ""digital collectibles,"" likely to distance their offerings from NFTs and the associated market hype.  State media and local authorities have also periodically issued warnings over the NFT market.  Wednesday's statement also called on consumers to protect themselves by having the ""correct consumption concept,"" resisting speculative investments and staying away from illegal financing activities.

The partnership, announced Wednesday, will enable FIS’s 6,400 clients to access large crypto trading venues, liquidity providers, lending desks and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Those clients include a buy-side assortment of asset managers and hedge funds, as well as banks and brokers.  “This is going to be a great opportunity to empower FIS’s clients to access all the weird and wonderful things of digital assets,” said Fireblocks Head of Corporate Strategy Adam Levine in an interview. “Whether that’s holding a variety of cryptocurrencies, making payments on stablecoins, accessing lending and borrowing platforms, or accessing permissioned DeFi, which is appropriate for the regulated institutions that we’re talking about.”  (On the stablecoin front, the news comes a day after BlackRock invested in Circle and said that it was “exploring capital market applications for USDC.”)  It’s another signal to the market that institutions are edging closer to crypto – even its more esoteric realms – provided the right sort of know-your-customer (KYC) handholding is made available to them. Fireblocks’ close involvement with Aave Arc is a good example of this approach.  “FIS clients would absolutely have the opportunity to participate on Aave Arc; obviously, they will have to go through the KYC-related whitelisting process, which we don’t anticipate being a challenge,” said Levine. “That’s a great live example and there’s more to come.”  Institutional DeFi  Many of the big banks are exploring structured products in the form of crypto derivatives, if not directly exposing themselves to the asset class. This is another area where a fintech provider like FIS that’s been in the market for over 30 years can be instrumental, said John Avery, FIS head of product for digital assets.  “There are investors who will seek out synthetic exposure as their only means of access to crypto and digital asset investing. But for the market makers and the brokers, they will need access to the underlying physical assets,” Avery said in an interview, adding:  “The appetite of traditional clients to control their own wallet technology and get exposure to different types of these assets will grow over time, either for their own portfolios or to support their structured products or derivatives businesses on top.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/04/13/fireblocks-and-fintech-major-fis-bring-defi-to-capital-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fb60676c78e4d3e4ac2382356a203c80df377556-5647x3765.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The number of ""hodlers,"" or addresses holding the self-proclaimed dogecoin killer for more than a year, has jumped by a staggering 1,900% to 3,750 since late January, data tracked by blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock shows. The number of ""traders,"" or addresses holding for less than one month, has declined by 38% to 49,790.  The balance held by long-term investors has increased by 127% to 27.93 trillion during the same period. The tally has increased 57% in the past 30 days alone.  The balance held by ""cruisers,"" or addresses with a holding period of one to 12 months, has dropped by 2% since January, while the number of coins held by traders has increased by 40% to 32 trillion.  The slight tilt toward ""hodling"" is perhaps a welcome development for the cryptocurrency, which is often criticized for being a gamblers' darling. Analysts consider a surge in SHIB's valuation as a sign of froth and the crypto bull market nearing an end.  ""SHIB hodlers remain unfazed and accumulated during the past weeks and it's paying off with today's Robinhood announcement,"" IntoTheBlock said in a Telegram broadcast.  On Tuesday, the popular trading platform Robinhood Markets listed shiba inu, opening doors for its roughly 17 million users to take exposure to the volatile cryptocurrency. SHIB jumped nearly 22% on Tuesday, registering its biggest single-day percentage gain since Feb. 6, according to data provided by charting platform TradingView.  While accumulation by holders during the recent dour price action is a welcome development for the bulls, the balance held by these addresses still accounts for just 5% of the total circulating supply of 549 trillion. ""Cruisers"" or addresses with a holding period of one to 12 months, own more than 93% of the supply, according to IntoTheBlock.  As a result, it's a long way before SHIB can shed its reputation as a cryptocurrency dominated by speculators. While addresses-based metrics are widely tracked to gauge investor activity, they aren't perfect indicators. A single entity can have multiple addresses and can hold its coin stash in several wallets.

Finally, the 24-hour trading volume of Icon is $31.99 Million, marking a 4.20% rise. Past Performance of ICX ICX coin price plunged 33% within a week as the bulls got crushed under the massive supply overflow near the 200-day EMA. The downfall cracks under the 50 and 100-day EMA and multiple horizontal levels and the psychological barrier of $1.

The bearish alignment of the daily EMAs (50, 100, and 200) maintains a bearish trend in the daily chart.

Data shows these funds were then moved to privacy exchange Tornado Cash. The exploiter seemed to have made several trades of 100 ethers each from all those wallets, data apparently shows.  The funds moved to Tornado Cash are worth upward of $65 million at current prices.  Tornado enhances the privacy of transactions by breaking the on-chain link between a source and a destination address. This allows exploiters and hackers to mask their addresses while withdrawing illicitly gained funds.
