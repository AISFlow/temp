42431335,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1jlh,1576944000,"For Quick Wins, Focus on Decentralization Within Existing Businesses","This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Tal Kol is the co-founder of Orbs, a public blockchain bringing enterprise solutions and transparency to businesses.      2019 pushed the reset button on our industry. While hundreds of blockchain startups launched during the 2017-2018 peak, many of their use-cases for decentralization were not strong enough to survive the ensuing crypto winter.      The startup world took a beating this year but there was steady interest in blockchain technology from the enterprise sector, which has always led in the experimentation and adoption of emerging technologies due to its vast resources and reach. Large companies ranging from IBM to Facebook to JPMorgan are working on blockchain projects.      Yet, even with established companies involved in the space, there’s a prevailing feeling that blockchain has been slow to deliver on its full promise, especially among mainstream businesses.    A centralized delay    Up until now, enterprise blockchain has been completely focused on private DLTs (distributed ledger technology, or “private blockchains”) that cannot deliver on the full potential blockchain has to offer. These private and permissioned blockchains like Hyperledger are pragmatic and easy to use, but they provide limited benefits compared to traditional databases. More importantly, they don’t even begin to take advantage of key features that come from public implementation and being permissionless.      Blockchain technology allows enterprise firms to compete on trust, but the current infrastructure solutions that facilitate digital trust were built for decentralized applications looking to “cut the middleman” and not for the middleman itself. As a result, most enterprise solutions today miss out on what is truly disruptive about blockchain and where the big value lies. They are essentially working with one hand tied behind their backs.    Bringing the best of blockchain    For the industry to continue to advance and mature, businesses need to begin using blockchain in a different way, bringing what public blockchain does best as an external, unbiased third-party verification and applying it to their enterprise-specific needs.      This is easier said than done. If you were to ask enterprises what the value of public blockchain would be for them, most would struggle to come up with an answer or even a single use case. However, some are beginning to take public blockchain seriously as a better long-term alternative to private, which is something they haven’t done in the past. They are starting to ask how decentralization can make them more profitable and how it can solve problems for them and their industries. They are searching out use-cases that enhance their businesses rather than disrupt them – i.e., they want to decentralize features rather than decentralize their whole business model.    Instead of trying to create new solutions to replace existing businesses with decentralized ones, startups should focus on improving existing businesses using decentralization.    Creating decentralized solutions isn’t an easy ask for companies already accountable to multiple large-scale projects, not to mention shareholder and boardroom demands. While the IBMs and Facebooks of the world have the money and people to work on the problems for themselves, most companies have more important priorities and cannot waste resources dealing with a relatively new technology that hasn’t been able to truly address their needs yet.    Startup agility    In 2020, crypto startups have the potential to make a transformational impact on the maturation of the industry. Instead of focusing on the absolute decentralization of businesses, as the first wave of blockchain startups did, they have the opportunity to develop the value-adds mainstream businesses want but can’t or won’t invest in themselves. Instead of trying to create new solutions to replace existing businesses with decentralized ones, startups should focus onimproving existing businesses using decentralization.      This may not sound like that big of an adjustment from 2019, but it will completely transform the way blockchain technology is built. For example, this is the difference between replacing Uber with a new peer-to-peer decentralized Uber and helping Uber improve its offering by providing stronger guarantees – backed by blockchain – to its users and partners.      For startups that embrace this new way of thinking, the best opportunities to start with now are smaller decentralized features that can be integrated into centralized products: features such as decentralized logins, data sovereignty or a blockchain-based notary.

42431328,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1jfh,1576940400,3 Under-the-Radar Product Trends for 2020,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Richard Chen is a partner at 1confirmation, a seed-stage venture fund supporting crypto-native founders fueling the decentralization of the web and society.      Bitcoin dominance. The rise of DeFi. Libra. QuadrigaCX.      Crypto always has its fair share of news and drama, and 2019 was certainly no exception. But underneath the surface, many teams are heads down building open financial products that the world needs.      As a fund, 1confirmation has been focused on backing teams bringing useful products to market this year – and a number of those products are starting to see real usage beyond pure price speculation.      Product usage is ultimately what’s going to push the industry forward in the long-run and I spend a lot of time thinking about what will get product-market fit. Here are three under-the-radar product trends that I believe will break out meaningfully in 2020.    1. Smart-contract insurance    Decentralized finance (DeFi) was ethereum’s poster child in 2019. Users committed over 2.7 million ETH as collateral to take advantage of a slew of yield-generating financial products. That means some $664 million was “locked in” to DeFi apps in 2019 as people looked to use their crypto without spending it.      One of the biggest advantages of DeFi over traditional finance is composability, and we’ve seen numerous aggregators like InstaDapp and Zerion being built with the MakerDAO, Compound and Uniswap money legos.      However, with DeFi composability comes systemic risk. If an underlying money lego like Compound gets hacked, then every project built on top of Compound suffers too. This is like in 2008 when defaulting subprime mortgages eventually caused Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns to come crashing down like a house of cards. Furthermore, as high-yield DeFi savings accounts like Linen and Outlet target mainstream users, the first question that always comes up is, What’s the risk?      Historically, smart contract audits and formal verification have failed to catch critical bugs. Traditional insurance companies are too slow and bureaucratic to get into this space, leading to the rise of new crypto-native insurance projects. Three projects – Nexus Mutual, Upshot and Convexity – are respectively using mutuals, prediction markets and financial derivatives for insurance. Each of these products have benefits and disadvantages and are useful in their own right, often for different purposes.      I’m most excited about the mutuals approach to insurance. Over the last few years in ethereum we’ve seen lots of experimentation with DAOs, from The Dao to MakerDAO to MolochDAO to Metacartel DAO and others. The insurance version of a DAO in the real world is a mutual, which is community-owned and operated like a “do-it-yourself” insurance company and the benefits are for its members.      There have been instances in history when insurance companies have been slow to move into a particular market and thus the mutual sector stepped in to fill the void. During the 17th century, British merchants and mariners pooled together their resources to form the first versions of marine insurance. A similar phenomenon is happening today with smart contract insurance, as projects like Flexa, Paraswap and Totle are pooling together their ETH reserves to offer insurance cover for users. Over $1 million of coverage has been taken out so far and that number will continue to grow throughout 2020.    2. Bonding curves    A bonding curve is a smart contract that mints and burns tokens. A mathematical formula determines the relationship between the price of the token and the token supply. Buying into the bonding curve pushes the token price higher along the curve, and vice-versa is true for selling into the bonding curve.      It’s no surprise that short-term cryptocurrency prices are largely driven by speculators trading on exchanges. Given that token prices affect the economics of crypto networks, bonding curves are great for projects that want the success of their token to be tied directly to a formula determined by some fundamental metric rather than to speculators’ whims.      Furthermore, there’s always liquidity for the token since the counterparty is the smart contract rather than another buyer or seller, so bonding curves prevent liquidity from getting fragmented across different exchanges in a multi-token economy.      Bonding curve tokens aren’t transferable so they work very nicely as DAO tokens. Buying into the bonding curve is like buying a membership for exclusive rights such as earning fees from some product’s usage. The fees can go to buying into the bonding curve, pushing the token price up and causing the token holders to directly capture value from the product’s usage.      Many projects in 2019 – Fairmint, Forte, Nexus Mutual, Uniswap, Cheeze Wizards and others – are using bonding curves and I expect to see more experimentation with new bonding curve models in 2020.        3. Wallet user-experience    The biggest bottleneck for mass adoption of dApps right now is the onboarding user experience.      A whopping 99 percent of new users drop off when told they need to download the Metamask extension, according to Dapper Labs CEO Roham Gharegozlou. Using dApps today is like trying to use the Internet back in 1993 before the Netscape browser existed (you had to physically go to a bookstore to buy a TCP/IP software floppy disk and follow a 38-step installation process).      Fortunately, a lot of great UI/UX research has been done over the past year to improve the dApp user experience and will get implemented in wallets throughout 2020. I’ll highlight two: contract-based accounts and meta transactions.      Contract-based accounts (as opposed to externally owned accounts) are backed by smart contract code and do not need private keys to access the funds. Smart contract wallets that leverage contract-based accounts eliminate the user’s need to manage private keys while being non-custodial at the same time. These wallets can also be programmed with security features of a traditional bank, such as account recovery, fraud protection, and withdrawal limits. Over the next year, ethereum users will shift from mostly having externally owned accounts to having contract-based accounts.      Meta transactions rely on relayers to broadcast user transactions to the ethereum blockchain, giving dApps and wallets a lot more flexibility over the user experience. dApps could subsidize users who want to try out the dApp before purchasing cryptocurrencies as part of their customer acquisition cost (CAC). Users could also use dApps solely with Dai without ever needing ETH to pay for gas.      I wrote a detailed overview of the wallet landscape earlier this year, and I believe the winning wallet approach will be both non-custodial and natively integrated. We’ll see users log in to dApps with an email and password just as they’re accustomed to with Web2 applications. Eliminating the need for a seed phrase backup or extension download will help dApps connect with more users.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MKR | TRADING,Richard Chen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/12/21/3-under-the-radar-product-trends-for-2020,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/701e1ffe15bfdb7579fe23f75a3473993244ef87-1500x1019.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431321,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1jPh,1576936800,An Identity Layer for the Web Would Identify Us Everywhere,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Elizabeth M. Renieris is the Founder of hackylawyER, a fellow at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard and an expert on cross-border data protection and privacy laws (CIPP/E, CIPP/US), digital identity, and technologies like blockchain and AI.      Mere months into the blockchain ID business, I had lost count of the presentations featuring the 1993 The New Yorker cartoon with the tagline “On the Internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.” Before blockchain, I had understood the cartoon to depict an intentional and original design choice of the early internet – the privacy and anonymity of users. Now, it was being used to justify the development of a whole new web with a built-in, blockchain-based identity layer. Needless to say, I was confused.      Through the lens of hindsight, this single engineering decision on anonymity is blamed for everything from bullying and hate speech, to misinformation and election interference, and myriad other abuses. While anonymity certainly complicates mitigation and enforcement efforts in responding to these issues, I am unconvinced that a blockchain-based identity layer for the web is the answer. On the contrary, it could have dire unintended consequences. But first, some context.      At one point, identity was just one of many potential use cases for blockchain (in fact, I worked on one of the first “identity tokens”). After all, blockchain was never essential to digital identity (traditional PKI-based solutions worked just fine). Still, as we reached the height of the ICO boom in 2017, the number of blockchain-based identity companies and projects proliferated, leading many to ask whether identity was blockchain’s “killer app.” Why the shift? Although identity did not require blockchain, it was becoming clear that blockchain needed identity.      In tokenizing things, we turned them into microeconomic transactions, manifesting in literal “marketplaces,” including for identity (identity for sale, anyone?). Coupled with the ICO framing, these primary marketplaces were also accompanied by secondary markets for trading in the tokens themselves. This transactional framing heightened the regulatory specter and introduced an array of compliance requirements that required, well, identity.      As other use-cases met the real world with its laws and regulations, there was a growing appreciation for compliance challenges and a growing recognition that all blockchain applications and use-cases would have to solve for identity (enter “KYC coins,” RegTech, and the like). In a post-ICO world, these projects have shifted to a new ambition – an identity layer for the web.    Adding identity to the web isn’t just adding it to the web anymore. With the digital subsuming our reality, it would become an identity layer for our lives.    An identity layer “for the web” was one thing when there was a separation between the online and offline worlds. Now, as we bring everything online through connected devices, smart cities, augmented humans, and (yes) blockchain too, the digital is “eating the real world” to put it in software terms.      If we bake identity into all things connected, we bake it into everything. We create a world where the default practice will be to identify in all contexts and all settings. In other words, adding identity to the web isn’t just adding it to the web anymore. With the digital subsuming our reality, it would become an identity layer for our lives.      In potentially solving important problems of identity for certain things, e.g. preventing fraud and abuse, we risk overidentifying ourselves and eliminating the possibility of ever remaining anonymous in any domain of our lives in the future. It’s the risks of a cashless society but even further-reaching.      Unfortunately, it’s something we don’t think about in the digital identity community very often, even as we worry about the censorship and privacy of transactions. In the “real world,” the only ubiquitous and persistent identifiers we have are our faces. This is perhaps why we find facial recognition technology so abhorrent that cities and municipalities are imposing wholesale moratoriums on it.      In the digital identity industry, we focus our attention on privacy and anonymity at the micro-level (for example, do you consent to sharing credential X? should we use a ZKP for Y?) without stepping back to question the system, and its very existence, at a macro-level (for example, does country Z really need a blockchain-enabled digital ID system in the first place?).      This may be, in part, because many of the central figures in the ID conversation, particularly those from the technical standards community, come from the early internet framing. We see the same individuals (people like Tim Berners Lee) trying to fix what is broken but based on the same starting point as before, overlooking what has now become a false dichotomy of the online/offline.      The risk is amplified by the properties of blockchain. In the bitcoin white paper, Satoshi argued that privacy on the ledger could be maintained “by keeping public keys anonymous” but cautioned that “if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.” Ten years later, we still lack effective key management solutions. With a permanent, transparent, and immutable ledger for tracking persistent identifiers, the risks are grave, and the protections are few.      It is easy to imagine the potential for self-imposed and externally enforced censorship, and to see how this might appeal to authoritarian regimes. We already see this risk with digital identity in general (with new national identity schemes, like India’s, rolling out with rapid speed, often with governments and the public sector abdicating power and sovereign functions to the private sector and their technologies). In fact, some speculate it is motivating certain countries to roll out blockchain-based systems that could surveil transactions, and in turn, people’s behavior and lives.      Given the ethos of the decentralized identity community, I doubt that anyone building this layer wants to end up in a situation of ubiquitous and persistent identification. On the contrary, I believe they would find it anathema. Of course, it wouldn’t be the first time the industry has faced unintended consequences (e.g., disintermediation resulting in more intermediaries, democratization resulting in more wealth concentration and inequality, and so on) but it is an overlooked possibility.      From my perspective, professionals in law, policy, regulation, and other domains of thought around decentralized identity should address whether we want to accept this default of persistent and ubiquitous identification or whether there are contexts in which we want (and should have) a right to remain anonymous.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Elizabeth Renieris,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/12/21/an-identity-layer-for-the-web-would-identify-us-everywhere,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/871173db5d83827112625c8a595f903a72bbd126-1198x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431324,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1jVh,1576933200,2019 Set the Stage for DeFi to Go Mainstream,"This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Lou Kerner is an advisory board member at Blockchain Coinvestors, co-founder of CryptoOracle, and partner at Chameleon as well as Flight Ventures.      MakerDAO started minting DAI in December 2017, and saw dramatic growth in 2018, as the daily supply in circulation grew to nearly 100 million:            In March, 2019, MolochDAO went live with 22 founding members, each depositing 100 ETH (the equivalent of $330,000 at today’s price of $150) into the decentralized and autonomous grants system. At the Ethereal Summit just two months later, MolochDAO received another 1,000 ETH from both Joe Lubin and Vitalik Buterin, plus 2,000 ETH from a group of individuals from ConsenSys and the Ethereum Foundation. In its first six months, it gave more than $120,000 to 17 projects.      2019 also witnessed the scaling of decentralized exchanges as liquidity solutions improved VIA locking ETH.      In total, we are now at peak ETH locked in DeFi applications:            With the majority locked via MakerDAO.    DeFi Is Poised To Drive Mainstream Adoption In 2020    The last three years has seen a lot of progress. Scaling is being addressed with various technologies including Plasma and Rollup showing great promise. We are seeing an increasing number of viable fiat on-ramps for both institutional investors (e.g. Bakkt) and consumers (e.g. Wyre). We’re starting to see standards set in foundational technologies like zero knowledge proofs (via ZKProof.org). So the main element we need to solve for now, is creating a product that people want. That people need. And there are two simple reasons why I believe that DeFi is poised to create that mainstream product in 2020.    #1 Composability Enables Rapid Innovation    A key aspect of DeFi is it’s composability, which is the ability to combine two distinct services to get a novel third service. A great example of this is InstaDapp, which created a link between Maker and Compound, increasing the efficiency of the entire lending market by enabling borrowers or savers to easily find and engage with the providers offering the best rates on lending, borrowing and margin trading. And InstaDapp was created at the ETHIndia hackathon, in two days.      With the introduction of Multi-Collateral DAI in November, 2019, we’re starting to see a more robust set of DeFi “Legos” that we can connect together to create products that were simply not possible before. While DeFiers can lock only two assets (ETH and BAT) together to create DAI today, we’re likely to see a proliferation of assets come to DeFI in the coming years, including fiat currencies and tokens derived from real world assets, like real estate. Thus creating more assets that can be connected to create new kinds of assets.    #2 DeFi Products Don’t Have To Ask For Approval From Regulators    DeFi has a major advantage over incumbent financial and technology companies because they can introduce products without asking any regulators for permission.      If Uber had asked taxi regulators for permission, there would be no Uber.      There is no Libra today because Facebook had to ask for permission because they’re centralized and have a $550B franchise to protect.      Maker didn’t ask for permission to introduce Dai. Uniswap didn’t ask for permission. Compound didn’t ask for permission.      If you don’t have to ask for permission, you can roll out a lot more products a lot faster, and are simply far better positioned to find product market fit.      New asset classes are born all the time, providing new opportunities for investors that were not previously available. Take junk bonds. When Michael Milken at Drexel invented this asset, all the other investment banks said they were garbage and would never issue or trade them. But investors wanted junk bonds, and the new class grew quickly, from $1.6 billion of issuance in 1981, to $33 billion just five years later. That dramatic growth was driven by the fact that junk bonds provided a way for investors to get higher yields that were simply not possible before. They found product market fit.

42431331,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN1jjh,1576928100,'Multi-Part' Payments Could Bring Bigger Bitcoin Sums to Lightning Network,"Bitcoin tech startup Blockstream said its c-lightning software team is the first to release a working version of ""multi-part payments.""      While the name, c-lightning v0.8.0, is a mouthful, it's a big improvement for the user experience of the lightning network, a new layer that's probably bitcoin's best shot at scaling to support a larger number of payments. The change updates the plumbing of lightning network payments so users can send larger lightning payments, with a much smaller risk of them failing.      ""The user experience of lightning clients is a topic that is brought up often, and we are working actively on improving the status quo, together with the teams working on other lightning implementations. Our goal is to make using lightning as easy as using an on-chain wallet,"" lightning developer Christian Decker explains in a blog post.      Right now, it's not as easy. For one thing, there's a chance there won't be enough liquidity in the network to support the transaction, especially for larger payments. Say a user sends 0.5 bitcoin across the network. Under the hood, it bounces from one node to the next until it reaches its destination. Each of those nodes needs to have 0.5 bitcoins that it can pass on to the next node.      If one of the nodes in the path doesn't have enough bitcoin, the user is out of luck and the payment fails.      Multi-part payments tackle this problem by making it possible to break a payment into smaller pieces that are easier to send across the network, since a user can combine bitcoin from multiple channels they have open to send payments.      ""Multi-part payments allow a lightning node to bundle the capacity in all its channels when making a payment, making larger payments than any individual channel on its own would allow,"" Decker writes. ""This greatly reduces the headache of managing how many channels to open, and how to allocate funds to them, since you can now simply combine them as and when necessary.""      Notably, while this release supports sending these types of payments, it still isn't possible to receive them. That functionality is still being worked on.      Decker claims the code change also ""greatly increases"" the resiliency of the entire payment network. Since users sending payments are less likely to have to transact with a large node, that's a ""single point of failure.""      Decker writes:    ""The capacity of the largest channel used to be the limiting factor when performing payments. As such, users were incentivised to open a single channel, with as many funds as possible, to a node that was as stable as possible. This led to users rating the reliability of nodes before opening a channel with them, since that node would now be their single point of failure, i.e., if that node was down, they couldn’t do much. With multi-part payments, users can now open multiple channels to multiple nodes, while at the same time being sure that the funds will be there when they need it. For the network, this means more connectivity and better resilience against the threat of big nodes suddenly disappearing.""    Blockstream says the technology will be expanded upon in future releases.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/12/21/multi-part-payments-could-bring-bigger-bitcoin-sums-to-lightning-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a104f2009b06c788106bac602c82bbdf9a5ebdc7-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
