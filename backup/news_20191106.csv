42382969,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tZGv,1573082435,Leading Japanese Firms Partner on Security Token Research,"Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group - Japan’s largest financial group and the fifth largest bank in the world by assets - is leading a 22-member research consortium to develop standards around security token management.  The group - the Security Token Research Consortium - includes security issuers, broker dealers and technology companies, such as NTT Docomo Inc. and KDDI Corp., the two largest telecommunications companies in Japan.  Securitize, a firm that enables the issuance and management digital securities, will be the only issuance platform provider for the consortium. The consortium will be the company’s first opportunity to tokenize fixed income assets, including bonds, where Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo told CoinDesk that tokenization has some of the best opportunities to create efficiencies.  The consortium is pursuing ways to develop, offer and onboard financial transactions services using blockchain, with a focus on automatic settlement for securities and funds. It plans to develop a dedicated security token blockchain called “Progmat” to provide a platform for managing securitized assets, including trust functions to minimize counterparty risk.  As a part of the research being conducted, the consortium will also apply for a Japanese patent regarding infrastructure and organizational structure for managing security tokens.  The consortium is being formed in the wake of Japanese legislators amending the country’s crypto laws. In March, Japan’s legislative body, the Diet, introduced a new bill to define security tokens as liquid securities, which would amend the existing Act on Settlement of Funds and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.  “It has to go through loopholes of intermediaries--the issuer, the paying agent, the clearing house--to be able to actually pay back to the investor whatever portion of the note they acquire,” Domingo said about the current way in which fixed income assets are issued and bought. “This process is bound to have errors.”  Earlier this year, Securitize launched its digital security offering service and a referral network to help companies issue and manage digital securities and registered with the SEC as a transfer agent to act as the official record keeper of securities issued on blockchain. The company raised a $14 million funding round backed by MUFG Innovation Partners, Nomura Holdings and Santander InnoVentures.  MUFG has several other blockchain projects in its innovation pipeline.  The Japanese financial services giant is developing a blockchain payments network with fintech company Alkami Technologies to be launched in the first half of 2020. Its blockchain trade platform with NTT Data aimed at fostering trade between Singapore and Japan is being tested now, while the company is also participating in a blockchain proof-of-concept to streamline know-your-customer processes with HSBC Singapore, OCBC Bank and the Info-communications Media Development Authority, a Singapore regulator.  UPDATE (6, Nov. 00:58 UTC): A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Securitize was the only company issuing security tokens in the consortium. Securitize is the only issuance platform provider that has joined the consortium.

42382957,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tZ6r,1573081219,WATCH: Deribit CEO Says Crypto Exchange's $1.3 Million Gaffe Was 'Wake-Up Call',"Deribit, the Amsterdam-based cryptocurrency exchange, is learning from last week's $1.3 million mistake.      That's how much Deribit agreed to reimburse customers after an Oct. 31 flash crash triggered by an error in the exchange's system for pricing bitcoin futures contracts.      CEO John Jansen said Wednesday in an interview that the company has since fixed the flaw and is planning further improvements to avoid a repeat. Deribit, which specializes in futures and options contracts on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, sees customer satisfaction and loyalty as crucial elements of its plan to occupy a leading spot in the fast-growing industry, he said.      The company made a quick decision to reimburse harmed customers because it was ""the right thing to do,"" Jansen said, while acknowledging that the question might have been more fraught had the cost been higher.      ""We really don't want this to happen again,"" Jansen said. ""This was like an expensive or maybe a cheap wake-up call.""      In last week's flash crash, futures prices on Deribit plunged quickly to $7,720 from $9,150 before bouncing back. The exchange quickly published a blog post on its website attributing the drop to a ""bug in our system,"" adding an apology and stating that some $1.3 million had been paid to reimburse customers.      Futures prices on Deribit are linked to an index that compiles prices from multiple exchanges, and the calculation went awry when two of those exchanges simultaneously went offline.      ""This all happened in, like, one and half minutes,"" Jansen said. ""The blame is on us.""      Most customer complaints have subsided, he said, now that the reimbursements have been paid out, and some traders even profited from the incident.      ""There were some users that had a handsome profit on this because we didn't take any money back from them,"" Jansen said. Some opportunistic customers even tried to use the incident as an opportunity to recover bona fide trading losses, he said:    ""We had to draw the line at some point. There were also some users claiming back their losses off the whole day.""    It's a fast-growing industry, and profitable, Jansen said, so the decision to reimburse wasn't really a choice, he said.      Deribit is the world's sixth-biggest exchange for trading bitcoin futures, well behind industry leaders BitMex and Huobi, according to data provider Skew.      Eventually, Jansen says, trading in crypto markets is likely to consolidate on a small number of exchanges, so the competition is fierce even in these early days for the industry.      ""You always have to to treat your customers correct,"" Jansen said. ""There are always alternatives to go to.""      Greg Ciplaro, co-founder of the crypto-market analysis firm Digital Asset Research, said in a separate interview that he wasn't surprised by Deribit's reimbursement offer.      ""They understand that this is a competitive market, there are high dollar stakes, and $1.3 million to make customers whole probably pales in comparison with the amount of revenue they make,"" Cipolaro said.      Jansen says he's the largest but not the majority shareholder of the closely held company, and he declined to disclose Deribit's revenue from trading commissions. But the reimbursement cost was manageable, he said:    ""This was, anyway, the right thing to do. But you also have to be able to do it, right?""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/06/watch-deribit-ceo-says-crypto-exchanges-13-million-gaffe-was-wake-up-call,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4384700e8da0609b3ca7a76a0a09bdf8019cdf29-1322x666.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382972,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tZJR,1573074018,WATCH: Binance CEO CZ Says Crypto Exchange Is No 'Outlaw',"MOSCOW – If you're looking to hide money from the authorities, don't choose Binance, says CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ).      The cryptocurrency exchange mogul sat down to talk with CoinDesk's Anna Baydakova during his recent visit to Russia. Our conversation – over 80 minutes long – touched on everything from custody to security to the crypto exchange's plans for Eastern Europe and Russia.      During the interview, CZ rejected the popular perception of Binance as a global crypto pirate.      ""There is a common misconception that Binance is kind of an outlaw, that we don’t work with compliance, we don’t work with law enforcement,"" he said. ""Even in the very early days we very cooperative with every government, with every law enforcement agency, every regulatory body.""      What about political dissidents who face criminal charges under oppressive regimes? Sadly, the same: if there is a criminal case against you, Binance will have to work with the authorities and possibly give out your information.      As CZ warned:    ""I hope those guys don’t use us. Much better, use decentralized exchange of some kind, privacy coins of some kind — just don’t bother us, I hope. We don’t have a chance. Unfortunately, in such cases, there is not much we can do, we just don’t have a choice.""  Growth plans    Russia is one of the key markets for Binance and that the exchange is interested in hiring local developers, CZ said. He also talked about the prospects for Binance's stablecoin project, Venus. Smaller economies are more likely to welcome the project, he said. He expects it to be popular in Bermuda, which recently started accepting taxes in Binance's U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin BUSD.      CZ doesn't expect to see Venus-related stablecoins get traction any time soon in large countries like Russia, the U.S. and China. Government-approved stablecoins, although far from the original decentralized and uncontrolled nature of crypto, are important for the development of the crypto infrastructure, he said:    ""The real world is not binary, fiat or crypto. We may not be able to advance [crypto adoption] in one big giant leap. We can have more degrees of decentralization.""    CZ also addressed the 125x leverage option Binance recently introduced. To those who think it's just a way for careless traders to get ""rekt,"" he responds: you don't have to use the sharpest knife you see.      ""This is what users have been asking for. So we give them what they want,"" he said. Asked if even higher leverage could be available on Binance one day, he said it was, ""at some point, when there is enough liquidity"":    ""500x exists in FX trading, in traditional financial markets. For cryptocurrency markets, it’s too high right now. But in six months, in a year, who knows?""    CZ also talked about the ambitious and controversial blockchain projects underway at social media and messaging giants Facebook and Telegram. Not even a total ban could stop them, he said.      ""Even if the regulators stop Libra, stop Telegram, those teams will launch something different. When an idea is in people’s heads you can’t kill it,"" he said.      ""The best case is, both of them clear the regulatory hurdle and they launch. They have a large number of users, we’re happy to support them,"" he went on. ""Worse case, they shut down, but those teams will do something in the blockchain space that will be a different iteration of the current thing. I don’t think they will be killed forever.""

However, the document does leave the door open for the ECB and other central banks to ""assess the costs and benefits of central bank digital currencies.""The European Union is taking a closer look at how to regulate stablecoins, but has no plans to issue one of its own.      A group within the EU presidency is working on a draft political declaration regarding the regulation of stablecoins, an individual familiar with the matter told CoinDesk. First reported by Reuters, the declaration will say the EU should regulate stablecoins in particular. However, the source pushed back on claims that the declaration would urge the EU to create a cryptocurrency of its own.  ""This is a rather short declaration that is about the EU position on how to handle those new types of cryptocurrencies,"" the source told CoinDesk. ""The focus is on how those cryptocurrencies should be regulated.""  The declaration is being developed in response to Libra, the global stablecoin project introduced by Facebook in June. Despite regulatory qualms about the stablecoin, Libra has so far proceeded, with its governing council formally signing onto the project last month.  The declaration does not specifically recommend that the EU should develop its own cryptocurrency in response to Libra, however. CoinDesk's source explained that developing its own cryptocurrency is one possible option for the EU that the declaration says ""should be explored.""  Pushing back on the Reuters report, the source said, ""There's absolutely no commitment at this stage to put in place a new cryptocurrency,"" adding:  ""The statement is to highlight the need for a proper regulatory framework for those stablecoins and as a consequence, different ideas should be explored. One of them is the possibility of having something that is managed by the ECB [European Central Bank] and other central banks.""  The source clarified that they could not speak to what the final version of the declaration would look like.The statement will be finalized by Friday, Nov. 8 and presented to EU finance ministers. The declaration is expected to be adopted by the EU on Dec. 5, at the finance ministers' next meeting, the source said.

42382973,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tZKh,1573063384,Square's Cash App Now Charging Fees for Bitcoin Purchases,"Update (Nov. 6, 22:11 UTC): Square confirmed that Cash App is rolling out a new fee structure for bitcoin purchases. Previously, the fees were baked into the spread. The article has been updated.      Jack Dorsey may ""love"" bitcoin but it looks like Square needs a better margin on it regardless.  Square's Cash App has started charging standalone fees of as much as 1.76 percent on bitcoin purchases, sources have pointed out to CoinDesk.  The Cash App's support website now acknowledges fees, writing:  ""Cash App may charge a fee when you buy or sell bitcoin. If so, the fee will be listed on the trade confirmation before you complete a transaction.""  It is unclear when that language was added but there were no fees associated with bitcoin purchases as recently as September.  According to the Internet Archive, the same ""Bitcoin Fees"" page said on March 8, 2019:  ""You are not charged a conversion fee, or any other fees, to buy or sell Bitcoin through the Cash App.""  One screenshot of a purchase page dated Nov. 5 showed a $0.10 fee for a $10 purchase (1 percent). We also saw $0.88 for a $50 purchase (1.76 percent) and $1.75 for a $100 purchase (1.75 percent). It seems that Square rounds down in certain instances.  After publication of this article, a Square spokesperson confirmed that Cash App is rolling out a new fee structure for bitcoin trades. Previously, fees were included in the spread (or the markup on the market price). Now Square says it has broken fees out of the spread for the sake of user transparency.  Additionally, Cash App updated the language on its website clarifying the types of fees it would charge for each transaction (the second fee, it should be noted, is dependent on market volatility):  ""Cash App charges two kinds of fees for bitcoin transactions: a service fee for each transaction and, depending on market activity, an additional fee determined by price volatility across U.S. exchanges.""  For smaller BTC purchases, the 1.76 percent fee compares favorably with Coinbase. America's leading crypto exchange has variable fees based on the size of the transaction, with fees starting at $0.99 for any purchase below $10. A $10 transaction on Coinbase incurs a $1.49 fee. At $50 to $200 the fee is $2.99. With a flat 1.49 percent fee for larger purchases, Coinbase becomes a better option above roughly $171, according to our tests.  All those fees certainly add up: Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced last month the company has earned more than $2 billion in transaction fee revenue since launching in 2012.  Square recently announced it would enable purchases of equities in the Cash App, and confirmed to The Verge there would be no fees for stock purchases.  Square processed $125 million in bitcoin sales through its Cash App in the second quarter of 2019, nearly doubling a record first quarter. However, Q2's bitcoin sales only generated $2 million of gross profit for the company.  Square also had its Q3 earnings call today, again reporting $2 million in profit on $148 million in quarterly bitcoin sales.

42382955,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tZ4L,1573052438,Nervos Network Targets November Launch With $72 Million Token Sale,"Blockchain startup Nervos Network plans to launch its ""Lina"" blockchain next week, on the heels of securing $72 million through a token sale on Coinlist.  The company announced Wednesday that developers and miners will be able to participate and utilize its network on Nov. 16, with fresh backing from China Merchants Bank International (CMBI), Polychain Capital, Blockchain Capital, Hashkey, MultiCoin and Distributed Global supporting its efforts.  The company initially sought to raise $50 million for the network, exceeding this amount through its three-week sale. Nervos declined to disclose the exact amounts of investment from each major investor.  ""The mainnet will enable users to build applications on our blockchain without facing the tradeoff between scalability and security,"" Nervos Network co-founder Kevin Wang said.  Wang told CoinDesk the mainnet’s two-layer structure allows users to build decentralized applications on a secure, public layer but actually run the applications on its second layer, promising ""unlimited"" scalability through this function.  The company’s new CKByte token entitles holders to storage space on the blockchain, acting as an incentive mechanism for miners and acting as a resource management tool.  According to the token’s official public offering statement, the company would use 23.5 percent of the initial token supply to encourage open-source contributions and business partnerships.  Wang said the mainnet could be used as the technical infrastructure for a variety of use cases ranging from decentralized finance platforms to assets tokenization.  Nervos had developed applications for the Chinese banking giant CMBI even before the mainnet launch. There are certainly more opportunities to collaborate with other financial institutions to build Defi applications after the launch, Wang said.  The company has established its significant presence in the Chinese developers’ community as some of the core team members are among the earliest ethereum developers in the country.  Nervos previously secured $28 million in Series A funding last year. The financing round was led by Polychain and private equity giant Sequoia China.  The fundraising was a private sale that guarantees 14 percent of the initial token distribution for the investors in 2019, Wang previously told CoinDesk.  The company will use the proceeds to invest more in research and development to improve the network, and incentivize more miners and developers to use the network, according to Wang.

The ministry was founded in September to supervise Ukraine's transition to a digital economy and online government services.

""Binance will also help develop transparent and effective mechanisms for the transfer of rights to any virtual assets or currencies using blockchain technology as well as beneficial conditions for investments and business in Ukraine,"" a press release provided to CoinDesk explains.  Binance will meet with Ukrainian government officials during the upcoming visit of team to Kiev. In the announcement, Binance's CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao described the new agreement as being positive for Ukraine, saying:  ""The legalization of cryptocurrencies and corresponding adoption of progressive legislation in this sphere can become one of the key drivers in stimulating positive growth in the Ukrainian economy, as well as attract additional investments to the country.”  Regulation on the way?

The legislation, he suggested, should be ready for introduction in Ukraine's parliament ""by the end of this year."" Ultimately, the ministry ""intends to create a comfortable, competitive environment for the crypto industry in Ukraine,” Fedorov said.

Announced Wednesday, the exchange said Bithumb Chain will allow users and developers to build decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on the open source blockchain network, which it hopes will act as the backbone to a new financial ecosystem.  The company is currently building out the network, with a testnet set to go live before the end of the year and a mainnet launch anticipated sometime next quarter.  Javier Sim, co-founder and managing director of Bithumb Global, told CoinDesk that the new blockchain will feature a ""revolutionary consensus model,"" referring to what the press release described as an OBFT hybrid consensus mechanism. However, he declined to share further details.  Bithumb representatives further told CoinDesk that the company is pursuing a patent around the mechanism, though the plan is to fully open-source the code prior to 2020. They did say that the consensus algorithm would utilize ""verifiable random function,"" likening it to Algorand's protocol, and Byzantine Fault Tolerance.  VRF is a system where a function verifies its own output publicly, while BFT refers to the Byzantine generals’ problem, in which one must reach consensus among disparate actors operating in a trustless environment. BFT ensures that the system will continue working – even if some of the actors are working against it.  With Bithumb Chain, the company seeks to capitalize on their as-of-yet-unknown protocols with a variety of services, including exchange-as-a-service, which would allow users to set up their own decentralized exchange.  Bithumb Chain could compete with other crypto exchanges' custom chains, Sim said. Binance Chain, Binance’s own public blockchain, launched in April 2019, and is now home to its BNB token and Binance DEX, a decentralized exchange.  Bithumb's news comes days after The Korea Times reported that entertainment group IOK is moving to acquire a major stake in the exchange.

42382978,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tZQz,1573041646,'Party Starters': Stellar Event Sees Frank Discussion of Crypto Market Makers,"MEXICO CITY — If a startup hopes to release a token without embarrassing itself in the early days, there is one important thing it should do: hire a market maker.  That was the message from a panel Monday at Stellar's Meridian conference in Mexico City.  ""Market makers provide this initial step where you can start trading,"" said Sergey Yusupov, the founder of Stellar infrastructure startup Apay.  Thomas Scaria, a recent alum of payments firm Wyre and who's now working on a stealth-mode ethereum startup, described market makers with a metaphor: ""You want your cool friends to show up early to the party so it looks like something is happening,"" he said, adding:  ""They are kinda the party starters.""  Market making is widespread but generally discussed in hushed tones in the crypto space.  When Blockstack disclosed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last month that it contracted GSR Markets to provide liquidity for its STX token, it became one of the few startups to publicly acknowledge the practice.  ""Crypto matures towards transparent relationship with market makers,"" Blockstack CEO Muneeb Ali said later on Twitter.  Not to be confused with the fake volume industry, industry insiders say, market makers are a fixture in any mature financial market. They set up shop in very liquid markets, offering to always buy at a given price and sell at a slightly higher price. They make profits on that spread and aim for volumes that make the business worthwhile. While other buyers and sellers can also participate, market makers help to smooth out any gaps on either side of the order book.  For a price  In order to participate in a market, though, a market maker needs a large quantity of the asset for its sell side – and they are not going to take that risk on their own for a brand-new asset with no proven demand. That's why Monday's panelists argued startups should cover the cost of that risk.  ""Get your checkbook out,"" Scaria said.  Scott Freeman of market maker JST Capital said that when his firm takes on a new client, it actually likes to do some consulting before it gets started.  ""We really approach it as a partnership,"" he said, explaining that it's important that his team understands the startup's community, the product it's bringing to market and the founders' expectations.  Freeman also encourages token projects to think about market-making as more than price support. If people need a token to use a product, that token needs to be easy to obtain, so it needs liquidity.  ""View this as a marketing expense to some extent,"" he cautioned. ""This is the first piece of a very complex puzzle.""  And just like marketing, there's nothing that a market maker can do about a fundamentally bad product. Said Freeman:  ""If people look at your project and don't have faith in it, they are not going to buy your token.""

42382980,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tZPj,1573039034,Hong Kong Regulator to Treat Some Crypto Exchanges Like Brokers,"Hong Kong’s securities watchdog is to treat cryptocurrency trading platforms like traditional brokers if they offer security tokens, according to its second round of regulatory guidance for the industry.  The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) released its position paper on virtual asset exchanges Wednesday, announcing a new licensing scheme that it said is not dissimilar from the one applied to Hong Kong's security brokers and automated trading venues.  Any virtual asset firm trading at least one security token falls under the regulator’s purview. Applications for peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges – such as decentralized exchanges (DEX) or non-custodial trade platforms – will not be reviewed by the SFC.  Under the new licensing conditions, regulated crypto exchanges can only offer products to “professional investors” as defined by the SFC. Firms may also only alter products or services following approval by the regulator and must have an existing relationship with an independent auditing firm, filing annual reports on exchange activities. Exchanges must further file monthly reports to the commission.  Hot wallets – crypto storage with live connections to the internet – may not hold more than 2 percent of an exchange’s total funds. While exchanges are mandated to have insurance for all assets in the event of a breach or hack, the SFC states.  Anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures are cited as a chief concern, with the SFC saying exchanges must take steps to “establish the true and full identity of each of its clients, and of each client’s financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives.”  Upon the granting of a license, firms enter into the SFC Regulatory Sandbox which the regulator says brings more exacting reporting and monitoring standards.  The regulator also issued a warning Wednesday to providers of cryptocurrency-based futures products targeting Hong Kong citizens without the proper paperwork. The SFC said it “has not licensed or authorised any person in Hong Kong to offer or trade virtual asset futures contracts” to date and remains “unlikely to grant a licence or authorisation to carry on a business in such contracts.”  Crypto derivative providers like BitMEX and OKEx already restrict access to their products in Hong Kong.  Passed in November 2018 and updated this October, the SFC's first crypto licensing scheme, concerning funds that invest 10 percent or more of their portfolios in crypto, has only given the green light to one fund in the past year.

The report claims a man named Julian Kim, under the alias Tony Walker, was the sole owner and investor in the firm, and had attempted to withdraw money from banks in Singapore on several occasions. As per Chosun, the UN claims the laundering scheme, which also involved another undisclosed individual linked to the firm, circulated the stolen crypto through upwards of 5,000 transactions in multiple countries to obfuscate its source.  The report further states that North Korea has developed precision “spear-phishing” attacks. Over the past three years, a previous UN report said, 17 countries have been targeted by its hacking experts resulting in over $2 billion in losses – a figure that regime has denied.  Chosun adds that the report also notes the development of malicious code used to move stolen bitcoin to a server located at Pyongyang's Kim Il-sung University.  Severe sanctions against North Korea from the UN and other international bodies have pushed the country's regime towards cryptocurrencies over time. This September, Vice reported the country is developing its own cryptocurrency with properties similar to bitcoin to sidestep international sanctions.

42382966,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tZD9,1573030840,93 Days Dark: 8chan Coder Explains How Blockchain Saved His Troll Forum,"The Takeaway:  Administrators at 8kun, the anarchic message board formerly known as 8chan, have been experimenting with blockchain and p2p technologies in an effort to build a website resistant to deplatforming and censorship.  They found an ideologically aligned open-source blockchain to piggyback on, but the developers don’t seem keen on protecting 8kun from activist attacks.  Ron Watkins, the principal 8kun dev, plans to launch the mysterious Project Odin in an attempt to bolster the publicly accessible and hidden versions of his site.      8chan, the anarchic internet forum that disappeared in August, came back online this weekend as 8kun. This time, thanks to a decentralized web hosting network, it intends to stay online, no matter who its content offends.  Following back-to-back shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio, hosting service Cloudflare severed ties with 8chan, blaming its raucous community of anonymous posters for inciting the violence.  “8chan has repeatedly proven itself to be a cesspool of hate,” said Cloudflare’s CEO Matthew Prince on the day it terminated service. Other major hosting providers, including Tencent and AliBaba in China, followed. For these corporate giants, 8chan amounted to little more than a pungent mix of pornography, extremism, and race-baiting, and hence not a brand with which they wanted to be associated.  Yet while its many detractors saw 8chan as a vortex of fringe politics and looney-tune conspiracy theories, others defended it as a beacon of free speech in an age of political correctness and corporate media consolidation. Alongside the terrorist manifestos, there were WikiLeaks-style document dumps.  And the founders didn’t give up.  “We are at the forefront of the deplatforming war and developing tools and techniques that other websites can use when they too get deplatformed,” Ron Watkins, an 8chan admin, told CoinDesk.  “Unlike other platforms that have faced controversy for banning relatively innocuous speech, 8chan features a full commitment to the promise of the First Amendment,” site owner Jim Watkins (Ron’s father), told the House Committee on Homeland Security in a closed-door session on Sept. 4. ""At the same time, it has worked responsibly with law enforcement agencies when unprotected speech is discovered on its platform.”  What follows is an inside account of 8chan’s rebirth, based on interviews with Ron Watkins. It also includes interviews with Fredrick Brennan, the now excommunicated and deeply critical creator of 8chan who quit after playing a key role in developing its blockchain solutions.  While the clearnet, or publicly available, version of the site is down intermittently, and unlikely to survive an onslaught of continued compromising attacks, Watkins described a strategy to rebuild 8chan through decentralized workarounds instead of relying on consolidated services that become unusable in the face of controversy.  Loki  Three months after going dark, 8chan’s developers turned their backs on traditional internet service providers (ISPs) and found a permissionless, decentralized and censorship-resistant way to host discussions online.  Chief among these is an open protocol called Lokinet that will soon be connected to a blockchain. The network, based on a fork of the monero cryptocurrency called Loki, functions like the privacy-protecting Tor network.  Lokinet provides a pathway for hosting web content – including decentralized marketplaces, forums and other web applications – that is resistant to censorship and deplatforming.  Any website accessed through the “.loki” top-level domain (TLD) is passed through an “onion-style” router that bounces user data packets, necessary to surf the web, through a distributed network of nodes to obfuscate users’ destinations and origins. Loki is open for anyone to use and the nonprofit that maintains the network was made aware of 8kun’s intentions only four days before launch.  Watkins was clear that 8kun has not partnered with the Loki development team, but instead is “using the network that they set up and made available for anybody.”  Simon Harman, director of the Loki nonprofit based in Melbourne, Australia, said he was surprised that the network withstood the influx of new users, many of whom likely downloaded the software to support 8chan’s relaunch.  “Getting several thousand users to try out experimental software, that’s a plus,” he said. Since the Lokinet system went live in 2018 there have been 5,271 downloads of its routers, of which 3,600 happened since Sept. 24.  Watkins said he set up a few Lokinet addresses and front ends that connect to the network and service the website. Nick Lim, CEO of VanwaTech, also built a content delivery network on Lokinet to serve 8kun’s service node apps (SNApps) – private websites or web services similar to Tor’s hidden services – and provide acceptable data speeds.  “We chose lokinet because, while still experimental, it is already a technical powerhouse,” Watkins said.  However, over the weekend, an influx of friendly and hostile users flooded 8kun and nearly crippled the website.  To be clear: Loki (named after a mischievous mythological character) did not choose 8kun. And as antagonistic parties attack the message board served by Lokinet, lead developer Jeff Becker said he doesn’t “want to get involved.”  “I have no intention of trying to get rid of 8kun or shut down the network, I’m just worried that it is quite easy to [attack] the network in this early state, and someone will probably do it, but it certainly won't be me,” he said.  Activist attacks  As it stands, 8chan creator-turned-apostate Brennan has tweeted a few potential weaknesses that activists could exploit to take down or slow the clearnet and hidden darknet versions of the site. These include a coordinated distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), or flooding a website with unwanted requests.  “8kun uses a rather ancient codebase with several vulnerabilities easily checked by anyone on Github,” said Gr3y, a web developer who goes by @L33TGUY on Twitter. A vocal group of opposition hackers is planning attacks on Twitter and internet relay chat (IRC), he told CoinDesk.  Like Brennan, Gr3y is no friend of 8kun. After Cloudflare dumped 8chan, the two led a campaign lobbying other service providers to knock it off their platforms. They rallied an army of anonymous posters to alert companies about “8Chan, Jim Watkins, and his shady history,” in Gr3y’s words.  “Jim or rather /pol has plenty of enemies, especially far-left activists, I'm not affiliated with any of these people but I know they exist,"" Gr3y said, referring to the subset of users who post the edgiest content (“pol” is short for “politically incorrect,” the ironic name of a message board on predecessor 4chan). Only 20 minutes after 8kun launched, activists began DDoS attacks that are currently interrupting 8kun’s service, he pointed out.  While Loki bills itself as a decentralized protocol, Viktor Shpak, chief technology officer for VisibleMagic, a blockchain consultancy, thinks adoption will be a hurdle for the relatively immature platform. What makes Tor a serviceable, reliable and secure router is the number of nodes that support the service, he noted.  The limited number of nodes running Loki will make 8kun highly visible on the network, and vulnerable to government crackdowns, Shpak said. Plus, while it was in the testing phase the developers disconnected the relay from the Loki blockchain.  Watkins said he lost confidence in Lokinet, and Becker, after the attacks.  “Jeff’s actions as the lead dev do not align well with his project's stated mission,” Watkins said. “User- and community-built nodes can sustain 8kun on lokinet with or without the lokinet dev team's approval,” he said.  Odin  Watkins said he has another card up his sleeve if Lokinet proves unworkable.  Project Odin, named for the ancient Norse god of wisdom (Loki’s blood brother in mythology), may provide a way to leverage 8kun’s users to run front-end nodes that support the website’s decentralized back end. Watkins suggests Odin will supplement the other models of security in his plan by enabling cross-platform interoperability, a shared user base and immutability.  “Activists might be able to temporarily deplatform 8kun.net, but can they deplatform ten thousand mirrors maintained by the community?” said Watkins.  He claims to be on the ninth iteration of the project. However, no previous versions of Odin were published and only traces of its development are available online. There are potential liabilities with having users run their own front ends, Watkins explained.  With details scarce, those following the project are left to speculate.  Justin Johnson, an IT security specialist in North Dakota and a frequent visitor of the “chans,” has high hopes.  “This is the future of open source which maintains the values of openness and accessibility,” he said.  Gr3y is less sanguine. The technology seems “way past Ron's pay grade… at this point if they're able to get 8KUN available on clearnet in a permanent capacity, I will be very surprised,” the developer said.  Building a censorship-resistant network in the face of fevered opposition is certainly a tough assignment. But Odin isn't Watkins’ first rodeo.  Susucoin  In 2018, when 8chan was still alive and alternately horrifying or thrilling people, Watkins and Brennan began developing a blockchain solution that would become known as susucoin.  Motivated by a fear of corporate consolidation of online publishing, the susu team created a blockchain protocol “where anyone can securely voice their thoughts and opinions without fear of reprisals, bans, or deletions,” according to the susucoin white paper.  Watkins hoped that susucoin would develop into a substrate from which a whole ecosystem of censorship-resistant platforms would spring forth, beyond the reach of authoritarian governments, censorious corporations, and overzealous moderators.  A blockchain-based message board, susucoin amounted to a bitcoin fork that supports the exchange of “small blobs of text,” according to extensive CoinDesk interviews with Brennan.  On Jun. 26, 2018, the Susucoin team created a genesis block. The idea was to use outputs created during cryptocurrency transactions to archive message board posts. While the code was based on the main bitcoin protocol, it included features from the splinter cryptocurrency known as bitcoin cash.  Brennan refers to the protocol he built, SUMO, (storage utility memory object), as “a slight improvement on [bitcoin cash’s] memo system.”  Like its namesake wrestlers, SUMO wasn't pretty. “It is a technical wreck and not at all anonymous,” Brennan wrote in an email.  Under the new system, users would have to pay to post. Because the messages were limited by susucoin’s 512 byte OP_RETURN field, a 100KB image would need approximately 195 transactions, totaling pennies in value, to go through.  By tying messages to transactions, Brennan argued susucoin was part of a broader attempt by Watkins to monetize 8kun. In fact, prior to 8chan’s deplatforming, Jim Watkins implemented a “King of the Shekel” feature on the website, which enabled users to pay in susu to promote their posts.  But 8chan users were not interested in having to download new software or pay fees to post, so susu garnered almost no users, according to Julian Feeld, co-host of the QAnon Anonymous podcast, which debunks conspiracy theories from online forums.  The blockchain has long been touted as a boon for come-what-may freethinkers, but belief in its powers is hardly universal.  Blockchains are “shitty, slow, and expensive databases that do not scale well at all for something like user-generated content across billions of data points,” said Andrew Torba, CEO of Gab, a social network that prioritizes free speech over mainstream sensitivities and was itself deplatformed amid a media controversy.  Legal issues  Ironically, susucoin’s unpopularity and technological weakness may have saved 8chan from legal jeopardy, namely the consequences of preserving illicit content on an immutable ledger.  Though billed as the world’s online free speech haven, 8chan imposed some limits on what users could post. Moderators would remove content that violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and actively policed child pornography. However, the immutable susuchain would have made these workarounds harder to engineer.  “Whatever is written into the blockchain will stay there and there is no easy way to remove anything short of a hard fork,” Watkins said. He added that he designed susu without the ability to easily post anything beyond text, to make it harder for ne'er-do-wells to add porn.  While the First Amendment broadly protects free speech, there are exclusions to these constitutional covers. True threats — or statements expressing serious intent to commit acts of violence against individuals or groups— are not protected, for instance.  “For liability to stick, one would, for example, need to prove a direct connection between a user’s post and an 8kun employee, or that 8kun knew of specific harmful behavior on its platform and chose not to report it — essentially, that 8chan had exercised editorial control over its contents, which can be difficult to prove in a court of law,” said Nicole Ligon, lecturing fellow at Duke University School of Law.  Despite this, Watkins doesn’t see susu as an abject failure and is looking at how to integrate the blockchain into Project Odin.  Chan, reborn  As 8kun’s lights flickered on for the first time Saturday, Watkins told Twitter followers that the new rollout would take a few days to become stable.  “That first wave of visitors totally crushed our servers,” said Watkins.  And that’s not the only issue 8kun faces. While the platform now exists out of the reach of wantonly censorious corporations, anyone can attack an open-source protocol. Loki’s developers cited denial of service (DoS) as a particular threat, though there are multiple vectors of attack. Worse for Watkins, since Loki is still in a test phase, the developers aren’t actively attempting to prevent a torpedoing of the network, preferring to remain neutral.  “The risk is that if we cannot defend against the attack then our presence will be on and off until we figure out how to defend it,” Watkins said. While he’s working on technical defenses now, he knows that after deployment, he will have to “react to the next attack.”  Still, Watkins is optimistic.  “I’m leading a small ragtag team of idealists, doing their best to bring a small-scale discussion board platform back online amidst a bizarrely unprecedented defamation campaign,” he said. Where this represents just one battle, by developing tools and techniques that other websites can use if they get deplatformed, he thinks he’ll win the war.  Through this process, Watkins has begun to doubt that blockchain technology can save free speech, let alone save 8kun. Instead, he thinks it could play a role in building a defensive infrastructure.  “Right now, all the blockchain-based platform experiments still impose too much technical friction for users, such that normal people won’t bother with them,” said Justin Murphy, an independent scholar who studies fringe online political groups.  The answer probably lies in maligned sites going dark, whether that be through tor, loki, i2p or zeronet, Watkins said. “What matters on the deepnet is that large public corporations are not in control and don’t have a say in what content is online or not,” he said.  8kun’s ongoing attempts to resurface against the tide of technocrats, media and politicians, might be the last time centralized authorities have the ability to shut down a website based on moral rather than legal decisions. Now the tech just has to work.

42382956,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tZ5b,1573027202,Only 1 Crypto Fund Has Passed Hong Kong's SFC Regulatory Hurdles in First Year,"A year after the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) published initial regulations for funds investing in crypto, only one firm has successfully passed that gauntlet.  Hong Kong-based Diginex remains the sole crypto fund to pass the regulatory hurdles issued in Nov. 2018 and formalized this October, according to research from Reuters.  As CoinDesk reported at the time, the 2018 framework applied new regulations to any fund that invested 10 percent or more of its portfolio in virtual assets. The 37-page guidance issued last month adopts many standard practices held by funds overseen by the regulator already, such as capital reserves on hand. New rules include who can act as custodian for crypto assets, for example.  Still, only one firm has cleared the SFC's hurdles to-date, Reuters says, while other funds are moving out of Hong Kong to “skirt” the SFC. Many firms are also applying for approvals without the intention of receiving the license, but just for appearances, according to the Reuters research.  However, outside factors remain for the low volume, including possible hangover from the crypto bear market that may be giving spurned funds second thoughts.  “The volatility and poor returns in 2018 scared large institutions away from allocating to crypto funds, causing those who survived to shelve their licensing plans,” Jehan Chu, partner at Kenetic Capital, a venture capital firm focusing on digital assets, told Reuters.  SFC declined to comment on both the process and pending applications, Reuters said.

The Responsible Sourcing Blockchain Network (RSBN), an international consortium built on Hyperledger Fabric, announced Wednesday it had successfully completed a pilot project to protect against exploitative mining practices. The companies sent 1.5 tons of Congolese cobalt across three different continents over five months of refinement, clearing the way for the project to become operational in spring 2020.  While Ford, Volkswagon and LG had already been a part of the project, Volvo joined Wednesday, according to a press release.  RCS Global Group, the solution's auditors, testified that the pilot cobalt met Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) sourcing standards from its start in a Congolese mine, through its refinement in South Korea and ultimately to its target: an American Ford Motor Company plant.  LG Chem, the largest Korean chemical company, developed the batteries.  Cobalt components make up some 10 to 20 percent of the Lithium ion batteries carmakers favor, according to the Cobalt Institute.  Martina Buchhauser, Volvo’s head of procurement, said in a statement that the Swedish carmaker has always put a high priority on ethical mineral sourcing. This technology furthers that goal, she said, adding:  ""With blockchain technology we can take the next step in ensuring full traceability of our supply chain and minimizing any related risks, in close collaboration with our suppliers.""  Expanding the supply chain  Dr. Nicholas Garrett, CEO of RCS Global Group said in a statement that RSBN is hoping to improve global ethical supply chains and will build off the lessons learned.  ""We’ve reached significant new milestones as we’ve moved beyond testing, proving the merits of this coupled technology and assurance model can extend to a wide range of participants across every tier of the supply chain and to other minerals,"" he said.  RSBN plans to add more battery minerals to its tracking platform, including lithium and nickel. From there, it will research ways to trace tungsten, tantalum, tin and gold.  Garrett was optimistic for the future of the RSBN blockchain and his auditor's role, saying:  ""We expect significant positive social impact from our work.”  Congolese mine image via Flickr",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | MINING | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/06/ibm-ethical-mineral-sourcing-blockchain-to-debut-in-spring,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3351451c06c5e0a1cc246b61b6c6f7afc3cf127f-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382952,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9tZ35,1573016339,Chinese Agency Scraps Plan to Eliminate Bitcoin Mining Industry,"More than six months after the China National Development and Reform Commission proposed to categorize bitcoin mining as an industry to be phased out from the country, it appears the agency has now scrapped that plan.  The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), a top-level economic planning agency under China's State Council, published a finalized new Catalog for Guiding Industry Restructuring on Wednesday that will take effect from Jan 1, 2020.  In the final version, which will replace the current one published in 2011, the agency has removed bitcoin mining or other virtual currency mining activities from the initially proposed category of industries that should be eliminated from China. Description related to virtual currency or bitcoin mining can't be found in the finalized catalog.  Formally established in 1998, the NDRC is now one of the 26 cabinet-level departments which all together form the State Council of the Chinese central government. The main role of the NDRC focuses on studying and penning economic reform strategies and policies to be executed at local level governments.  The NDRC first published its industry reform catalog in 2005, grouping industrial sectors into three types – those the agency advises the country to encourage, restrict or eliminate.  The initial draft of the latest catalog update was released in April this year, which classified ""virtual currency mining, such as the production process of bitcoin"" under the category to be eliminated, recommending local governments to phase out bitcoin mining from the country that's estimated to account for half of bitcoin's global hashing power.  The move was taken at the time by many, including major news outlets, as a signal that China was planning to ban bitcoin mining even though the policy itself does not automatically mean a bitcoin mining ban.  The revision of the draft plan comes after a months-long period of public consultation.  During a NDRC press conference on Wednesday, officials said since the release of the initial draft, the agency has received over 2,500 suggestions on various issues, most of which were taken into consideration, although the officials did not comment on any particular suggestion related to bitcoin mining.
