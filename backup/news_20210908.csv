42415197,Qdxg6jMEJ6GhmjUz49WjjK,1631133267,Here‚Äôs How the US‚Äôs Infrastructure Bill Crypto Tax Provision Might Be Implemented,"As the U.S. House of Representatives prepares to vote on the Senate‚Äôs $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, tax lawyers are waiting for the federal Treasury Department to issue guidance on the proposed crypto reporting provision it includes.  In August, the crypto industry came together in an intense effort to amend the provision in the sweeping bill, which appeared to broaden the definition of ‚Äúbroker‚Äù beyond cryptocurrency exchanges and similar types of trading platforms to potentially include miners, node validators and developers, among other types of entities that don‚Äôt facilitate transactions for customers.  Despite bipartisan calls to amend the bill, it passed the Senate in its original form on Aug. 11, and the House is now set to vote on the unamended bill on Sept. 27.  Legal experts warn that if the bill is implemented as it appears, there may be no way for some industry participants to comply.  For instance, according to Nathan Giesselman, a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, the provision in its original form runs the risk of capturing someone who is not in a position to have the same customer information that a traditional broker might have, putting these individuals in a place where they cannot comply with the required reporting.  ‚ÄúThey‚Äôd either have to cease their activities or accept non-compliance and run the risk of the associated penalties,‚Äù Giesselman said.  Alex Muresianu and Garrett Watson, policy analysts at the independent tax policy analysis group Tax Foundation, said the reporting requirements, as written, are ‚Äúpotentially unworkable.‚Äù  However, reports indicating the Treasury Dept. plans to clarify the definition of ‚Äúbroker‚Äù surfaced earlier this month. In one report from Bloomberg, an unnamed Treasury official said the department will stick to the definition of ‚Äúbroker‚Äù laid out in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), and not target entities that do not fall under it. The IRC defines ‚Äúbroker‚Äù as ‚Äú(A) a dealer, (B) a barter exchange, and (C) any other person who (for a consideration) regularly acts as a middleman with respect to property or services‚Äù but excludes persons ‚Äúwith respect to activities consisting of managing a farm on behalf of another person.‚Äù  Although the industry‚Äôs hopes will soon hinge on Treasury‚Äôs own guidance on the provision, some U.S. tax attorneys are not completely convinced that the Treasury will follow through with narrowing the definition of broker, if the bill itself remains unamended.  ‚ÄúIt sounds like good news but it‚Äôs not clear if what they say now is what they‚Äôll actually do in practice,‚Äù said David Zaslowsky, partner at Baker & McKenzie and editor of the law firm‚Äôs blockchain blog.  ‚ÄòYou never know‚Äô  Earlier this year, Zaslowsky co-authored a report on how the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is ‚Äúaggressively pursuing‚Äù taxes on crypto transactions in an attempt to increase tax revenue. According to Zaslowsky, the IRS‚Äôs intention was made clear by the very placement of a question about crypto transactions at the top of the individual tax return form.  With the new provision expected to help raise $28 billion within 10 years, the intention of the IRS to raise more revenue and combat tax evasion remains the same.  ‚ÄúIt is definitely the view of the Treasury that not everyone is reporting to them that should be,‚Äù Zaslowsky said.  Under the proposed provision, crypto exchanges will be required to continue issuing 1099 forms for non-employment income, Giesselman said, adding that he is unsure how many exchanges are currently reporting in a manner that complies with the proposed rules.  The uproar, however, was not over having trading platforms and exchanges that might not have been reporting properly be subject to new reporting requirements but over a broad definition that captured entities like miners, who don‚Äôt have the information being sought, Zaslowsky said. He added that by using something close to the existing definition of broker, the former group would be captured but not the latter, and there would then be increased revenue to the Treasury.  ‚ÄúBut is that really going to happen? That‚Äôs the concern, isn‚Äôt it? You never know,‚Äù Zaslowsky said.  What about NFTs and DeFi?  Giesselman predicts that, in practice, crypto exchanges will be the main focus of the new reporting requirement.  Shehan Chandrasekera, head of tax strategy at CoinTracker, agrees.  ‚ÄúI think that the Treasury is going to apply the broker rules strictly for cryptocurrency exchanges. That involves centralized exchanges like Coinbase, and could also involve decentralized exchanges like Uniswap,‚Äù Chandrasekera said.  Although the reporting requirement will cover exchanges, Giesselman also said that the scope of how far regulators go beyond these trading platforms remains uncertain.  ‚ÄúIs this going to pick up an enterprise that decides to mint its own stablecoin, mint its own cryptocurrency, their own [non-fungible tokens] and sell those in the market? Will these be caught?‚Äù Giesselman said.  Erin Fennimore, global head of information reporting at crypto tax software provider TaxBit, said that under the current infrastructure bill both NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi) would be covered as ‚Äúbrokers.‚Äù Joe Guagliardo, technology and blockchain partner at Troutman Pepper, agreed with Fennimore, saying the inclusion of NFTs in the definition is not up for debate.  Enforcement  The law, as currently drafted, will not take effect until after 2023.  ‚ÄúSo all of that is down the road. But the problem comes back to the fact that if the definition is broad enough to cover parties who, because of the way they operate, do not have the information that they are required to report, you‚Äôve got a problem,‚Äù Zaslowsky said.  Giesselman feels the enforcement of the law will play out similar to that of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), which came into effect back in 2010. FATCA sought to combat tax evasion by U.S. persons holding assets and bank accounts offshore, and required financial assets held abroad to be reported to the IRS.  But the initial FATCA requirements were notoriously complicated where everyone decided there was a problem here with a lack of information that needed to be fixed, Giesselman explained.  ‚ÄúExactly how the [FATCA rules] should be written in an administrable way in the real world took a couple of years to get right. And there were rounds and rounds of comments. I think the Treasury tried very hard to listen to the input that was coming in,‚Äù Giesselman said.  According to Giesselman, if the bill becomes law, the Treasury could go in one or two directions when it comes to the crypto tax provision. In one scenario, the Treasury could release proposed guidelines for compliance (which do not have legal effect until finalized), and open it up for public comments. Then the Treasury will consider the comments received, and maybe amend or clarify the proposed regulations before releasing final regulations.  In the other scenario, the Treasury could release proposed and temporary regulations (which are generally identical). But in this instance, the temporary regulations are legally effective immediately, Giesselman explained. Then, there will be a comment period, and the final regulations are issued, perhaps in amended form.  Given the 2023 proposed effective date, Giesselman says we could see the initial rollout taking either route, and it would depend on how long it takes the Treasury to get the guidelines ready.  ‚ÄúIf that took until late 2022, we might expect the second pathway to be used (so that the temporary regulations are effective by the time the law goes into effect), whereas if they could get out proposed regulations early in 2022, we might expect the former route,‚Äù Giesselman said in an email.  In yet another scenario, the Treasury might also take a similar approach it used for certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 which sought to reduce tax rates for businesses and individuals, Giesselman said. The Treasury might issue a Notice that describes in detail certain key rules that regulations will contain when issued, and allow taxpayers to rely on these rules until regulations are finalized.  ‚ÄúIf, for example, there was a strong desire to limit the scope of who is viewed as a broker, that might well be done via a Notice while the overall package of guidance proceeds at a slower pace,‚Äù Giesselman said.  Regardless of how the Treasury interprets the term ‚Äúbroker,‚Äù Fennimore indicated that change is inevitable.  ‚ÄúWhile this is a procedural shift, it is not ‚Äòunworkable.‚Äô It involves implementing processes and procedures, along with technology, to facilitate the collection of the required information to report forward to the IRS. The best advice would be to start preparing sooner rather than later,‚Äù Fennimore said.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/08/heres-how-the-uss-infrastructure-bill-crypto-tax-provision-might-be-implemented,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7eb6b3c33b11b6df029195e9c1c363ce3f9311a8-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The stock ($COIN) slid 4.1% on Nasdaq to $256, after falling over 4% on Tuesday amid a broad retreat in cryptocurrency markets.  Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal wrote late Tuesday in a blog post that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had sent the company a regulatory warning known as a Wells notice, threatening to sue the exchange if it launches the planned ‚ÄúLend‚Äù program offering a 4% annualized yield on deposits of the dollar-linked stablecoin USDC.

42415209,Qdxg6jMEJ6GhmjUz49Wjy2,1631133006,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Bullish Sentiment Fades as Selling Abates,"Bitcoin drifted lower on Wednesday as traders dealt with the return of volatility. September is typically a weak month for bitcoin, with stronger gains expected in November. The current volatility has some analysts expecting further consolidation and limited upside over the near term.  Last week, the crypto fear and greed index entered ‚Äúextreme greed‚Äù territory, mainly due to an extended period of low volatility, according to Arcane Research. Currently, other measures of crypto sentiment appear to be in neutral territory.  Recent regulatory action contributed to the current negative sentiment. Last week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced an investigation into Uniswap Labs, a decentralized crypto trading protocol.  Then, on Wednesday, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong stated the SEC issued a warning of its intent the U.S. crypto exchange should it launch its Lend product.  ‚ÄúThe outsized move seems to have been triggered by regulatory fears, taking the steam out of the frenzied rally,‚Äù crypto trading firm QCP Capital wrote in a Telegram chat, referring to strong gains in alternative cryptocurrencies over the past month.  ‚ÄúWe expect some consolidation in the market having washed out the euphoric retail leveraged longs from the last two weeks,‚Äù QCP Capital wrote.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $46,170, -0.9%  Ether (ETH): $3,494, +3.2%  S&P 500: -0.1%  Gold: $1,830, +1.0%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.338%  Bitcoin drawdown  Bitcoin‚Äôs drawdown, or the percentage decline from the April peak near $65,000, is currently around 26%. Typically, drawdowns that exceed 50% indicate the start of a bear market, similar to what happened in 2018. The sharp drawdown of about 60% in March 2020, however, was brief because the coronavirus pandemic triggered selling across all assets deemed to be risky, including cryptocurrencies.  The chart below shows a significant repair of the roughly 55% drawdown between April and July, albeit cut short during Tuesday‚Äôs sell-off. Over the long term, the current drawdown is barely noticeable so long as bitcoin is able to hold support above the 200-day moving average around $46,000.  Recoveries from 50% drawdowns tend to be choppy, with occasional sell-offs that are quickly absorbed by buying strength, similar to the 2019 and 2020 price rebounds.  Declining open interest  Over $4 billion in bitcoin futures open interest has been cleared during the sell-off, according to data from Glassnode. ‚ÄúThis is the most significant leverage flush-out since the sell-off in mid-May,‚Äù the firm wrote in a Telegram chat.  The rise in open interest allowed for relatively high amounts of leverage, which became vulnerable to liquidations as volatility returned.  ‚ÄúBinance, FTX and other exchanges recently reduced their maximum leverage from 100 times to 20 times, which has helped remove the ultra high risk trades,‚Äù crypto research firm Coin Metrics wrote in a Wednesday newsletter. ‚ÄúBut it likely hasn‚Äôt had too much of an impact on the overall number of futures contracts being opened using leverage.‚Äù  The chart below shows the proportion of long active liquidations rising as high as 92.7% during Tuesday‚Äôs sell-off, the largest proportion since May 19.  Ether holds support relative to bitcoin  Ether, the world‚Äôs second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is down about 9% over the past week, compared to a 5% decline in bitcoin over the same period. ETH‚Äôs recent underperformance versus BTC is stabilizing in the aftermath of Tuesday‚Äôs crypto sell-off.  The ETH/BTC ratio is holding short-term support around 0.06 after declining from the 0.08 resistance level. Buyers will likely remain active in ETH, especially if the cryptocurrency holds support above $3,000 this week.  Is bitcoin overvalued?  Bitcoin‚Äôs Network to Transaction Value ratio (NVT), which measures the relationship between the price of BTC and its intrinsic value, is unusually high, according to ByteTree, a crypto asset management firm.  ‚ÄúWhen the NVT is high, the price of bitcoin is expensive relative to the network, and when low, cheap,‚Äù the firm wrote in a Wednesday blog post.  ‚ÄúCurrently, the price of bitcoin is extended, and the past few months have (sic) seen the highest NVT readings ever recorded.‚Äù In 2018, the NVT peaked around 20 (near the current level), which preceded a bitcoin sell-off.  Altcoin roundup  Algorand‚Äôs ALGO token surges on El Salvador‚Äôs crypto rollout: The price of ALGO jumped 34% to $1.84 early Wednesday, marking its highest price in over two years. In late August, El Salvador announced that it would partner with Koibanx, a Latin American financial infrastructure company, to create a wallet product for its citizens on top of the Algorand blockchain. The price of Algorand‚Äôs ALGO tokens has more than tripled this year, leading to a market capitalization of over $6 billion.  ETH turns deflationary, courtesy of NFT craze: For the first time last Friday, more ETH was burned as base fees than ETH minted for block rewards, adding deflationary pressure on ether.

42415195,Qdxg6jMEJ6GhmjUz49Wjfe,1631132904,Panamanian Congressman Presents Bill to Regulate Crypto,"Panama has introduced a bill to regulate the use of cryptocurrencies throughout the country.  The bill, presented by Congressman Gabriel Silva on Tuesday night, seeks to make Panama a ‚Äúcountry compatible with the digital economy, blockchain, crypto assets and the internet.‚Äù  The text proposes that individuals in Panama or legal entities established in the country may freely agree to use cryptocurrency as a means of payment for any civil or commercial operation not prohibited by the legal system.  The project also proposes that taxes, fees and other tax obligations may be paid using cryptocurrency.  As Silva confirmed to CoinDesk, the use of cryptocurrencies is not illegal in Panama. There is no enforced currency in the Panamanian constitution, although the U.S. dollar has been used officially since 1904, when a monetary agreement between the countries known as Taft-Arias took effect.  ‚ÄúThere are no certainties in the fiscal rules, and with this project we seek to bring them‚Äù, said Felipe Echandi, a local crypto entrepreneur who worked with Silva in the drafting of the bill.  According to Echandi, the bill subjects cryptocurrencies to the capital gains regime, as in the United States, and excludes them from value added tax (VAT). ‚ÄúWe believe this is a worldwide trend,‚Äù he said.  The proposed legislation also seeks to establish principles of banking interoperability so that traditional financial systems are compatible with new ones. In Silva‚Äôs words, that would mean the possibility of connecting a bank account with an exchange.  ‚ÄúToday you can‚Äôt even connect a bank account with PayPal,‚Äù Silva said.  According to Echandi, the objective of the bill is for crypto to be used by two parties that have a contract as well as create conditions to broaden crypto use, such as in a local store.  In addition to the regulation of cryptocurrencies, the project also seeks to ‚Äúexpand the digitalization of the state‚Äù through the use of distributed ledger technology by digitizing the identity of individuals and legal entities, according to a draft of the bill.  The digitization process will allow Panama to be compatible with smart contracts and DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations), the bill reads. ‚ÄúThe country has all the potential to be a digital identity provider for the rest of the world as Estonia has done with its digital residency program,‚Äù it adds.  ‚ÄúThe most futuristic vision is that Panama has to become a DAO,‚Äù said Echandi, who added that the bill is an intermediate step toward that vision.  According to Echandi, the bill seeks to strengthen the crypto ecosystem in the country and promote the arrival of crypto companies to the country.  ‚ÄúWhile it is not currently illegal to acquire or buy cryptocurrencies, there are not numerous exchanges or platforms to convert from fiat to crypto or vice versa,‚Äù he added.  In addition, the proposed legislation allows issuers of securities to use distributed ledger technology, blockchain, or cryptocurrencies to represent those releases.  Just as Panama has become a financial hub in recent years, with this bill the country could become a desirable jurisdiction for companies seeking to issue any type of asset, Echandi said.  Silva ‚Äì a member of Bancada Independiente, an independent and opposition party ‚Äì said that both the ruling and opposition benches are willing to deal with the bill. In the last two months, he met with different public institutions that would be involved in the operation of crypto, such as the Ministry of Finance, the National Bank and the Superintendency of Banks, he added.  The project gathered comments from different parties, including lawyers, bitcoin users, crypto-related companies and government officials, Silva said.  Silva confirmed to CoinDesk in June that he was going to introduce the bill in July, although it was delayed by the collection of comments from different parties, he added.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Andr√©s Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/07/panamanian-congressman-presents-bill-to-regulate-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d695333b08f19546aad89b2074821c2e8dd2d92e-400x300.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

On Saturday, developer Nate Alex launched the Completely Pointless NFT collection. A run of 969 tokens, the Completely Pointless NFTs display the buyer‚Äôs public Ethereum key, change color when traded and were coded in ‚Äúa half-hour,‚Äù Alex told CoinDesk in a video interview.  ‚ÄúThis was coded extremely fast so no guarantees it even works properly,‚Äù Alex wrote on Twitter. ‚ÄúApe at your own risk.‚Äù  The collection sold out on Monday, shortly after Alex announced he would be donating the 40 ETH in sale proceeds to GiveDirectly. GiveDirectly is a direct aid organization that claims to have given 88% of all donations to individuals living in poverty.  ‚ÄúI spent more time researching charities than I did coding the thing,‚Äù he joked.  Shortly after Alex‚Äôs drop, audiovisual artist Deafbeef also released a drop of his own: FIRST, a collection of 5,000 algorithmically generated satirical ‚Äúfirst-ever‚Äù honorific NFTs. The drop raised 50 ETH for GiveDirectly, with an additional 10% of secondary sales, currently totaling over 350 ETH, routing to the charity in perpetuity.  In comments on Discord, Deafbeef told CoinDesk he was ‚Äúpleased that this charity drop has raised over $1 million for GiveDirectly.org.‚Äù  Has Loot jumped the shark?  The Completely Pointless drop pokes fun at Loot (for Adventurers), a text-based NFT collection that some believe will be the foundation for an open-source metaverse ‚Äì lofty goals that reflect the euphoric state of NFT markets.

Market mania  While many projects are eager to lay claim to history and grab headlines with ‚Äúfirst-ever‚Äù claims, Alex told CoinDesk that market conditions where a few words on a black background can fetch tens of thousands of dollars is part of a storied crypto tradition: the classic pump-and-dump.  ‚ÄúPeople like to talk about community, but I don‚Äôt know, people say that without really knowing sh**tcoin communities existed years ago, and it was just people hyping s**t up,‚Äù he said, adding:  ‚ÄúI get the sense of community, having friends with common taste, I get why people are attracted to that. But that doesn‚Äôt make some sh**ty, low-effort NFT worth tens of thousands of dollars, that‚Äôs so dumb.‚Äù  Despite currently having no functioning game or official development team, Loot has nonetheless traded over $200 million in volume, and a spin-off ERC-20 token, adventure gold (AGLD) has a market cap of $188 million.

The chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Nigeria&apos;s anti-graft agency, Abdulrasheed Bawa, has lamented how crypto growth has been a problem for the African nation. According to the Anti-graft boss, crypto growth poses a far greater danger to the world economy and not only the Nigerian economy. Towards putting a stop to the threat crypto brings, Bawa says that there is a need for a collective and collaborative approach by authorities worldwide. Why countries must collaborate to curb scams amidst crypto growth - Bawa The EFCC chairman explained that there has to be a collaborative effort to end crypto crimes.

He made the remark recently at a symposium organized by the Centre for International Documentation on Organized and Economic Crime (CIDOEC).

Cream Finance, a decentralized finance network, was hacked a few weeks ago, with an unusual situation happening in which the hacker returned part of the stolen money. At the end of August, the DeFi protocol was shocked when it realized that a significant part of the lost funds was returned. This cryptocurrency platform, focused on BSC and virtual currency loans, was hacked on the 30th of August. The hacker took advantage of a system failure to mine 2,803 Ether tokens and 462 million AMP tokens, losing the platform around $34 million. Cybercriminals returned part of the money to Cream Finance After the attack on Cream Finance, the platform developers were disoriented, and unsure of the next step to take. However, the crypto website was lucky because it reported that the hacker had returned a part of the stolen money a few hours ago.

In the Senate Select Committee on ‚ÄúAustralia as a Technology and Financial Centre‚Äù held Wednesday, two crypto exchanges, Aus Merchant and Bitcoin Babe, testified to their repeated denial of services, often with no explanation given by the institutions that denied them.  The purpose of the committee is to review the federal policy framework around cryptocurrency and blockchain technology in the country, among broader issues within the fintech industry.  Michael Minassian, regional head of global payments firm Nium, testified that Australia was the only country of 41 others to have denied banking for Nium‚Äôs remittance services.  Bitcoin Babe founder Michaela Juric told the committee her banking services had been terminated 91 times over the course of her small business‚Äô seven-year history.  The committee also heard that Juric and family members had been denied personal banking services, which impacted their ability to establish basic utilities such as an internet service, water and electricity, as well as self-managed retirement funds and insurance.  Anti-competitive behavior  Juric said little to no reason had been given for the ‚Äúdebanking‚Äù and that banks were being ‚Äúanti-competitive‚Äù because they ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt like that there was this competition coming through that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies posed.‚Äù  In her submission to the committee, Juric said there was ‚Äúno opportunity for discussion‚Äù over her losing services from some of the country‚Äôs largest banks including Commonwealth (CBA), Westpac and Bank of Queensland.  Losing services from CBA was ‚Äúparticularly hurtful‚Äù to Juric, according to her submission to the committee. Juric said she was also personally debanked from all CBA accounts, which included an account Juric had held since five years old. Juric claims she is no longer able to access any bank account records or open an account with CBA.  Aus Merchant‚Äôs managing director, Mitchell Travers, provided evidence to the committee showing he had lost banking services on four occasions.  ‚ÄúAs far as I am aware, it was a risk-avoidance, risk-off attitude,‚Äù Travers said. ‚ÄúThe reasoning was that we were outside the scope of services for these banks and we weren‚Äôt given an opportunity to provide enhanced due diligence procedures.‚Äù  Sen. Andrew Bragg asked Travers if he thought the banks considered his company‚Äôs registration by the country‚Äôs financial watchdog Austrac to be worthless.  ‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs correct,‚Äù said Travers. Juric also said her Austrac registration was never brought up by the banks.  Bragg said the banks had told him the reason for debanking crypto businesses was due to a ‚Äúlack or low level of regulation‚Äù within the industry and asked whether increasing regulation for crypto markets would make the banks more willing to work with crypto firms.  Read more: Australia Faces Big Choices on Crypto Regulation  ‚ÄúSure, that‚Äôs a possibility,‚Äù said Juric.

42424670,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHVk1h,1631127198,Self-Regulation Is in Crypto‚Äôs Best Interest,"The past month has seen heavy regulatory crackdowns on the crypto industry in most regions of the globe ‚Äì from today‚Äôs news the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has warned Coinbase it may sue the exchange over its lending product, to bitcoin miners in China, to the Senate Banking Committee hearing, to the FCA blacklisting Binance in the UK. This is no surprise to anyone familiar with the financial landscape and its regulatory oversight.  Crypto regulation has been a long time in the making and is nowhere near what it should be. In retrospect, this is partly the fault of the crypto industry itself. There are a few points that we, in the crypto industry, have failed to grasp.  Dr. Amber Ghaddar is a co-founder of AllianceBlock, a decentralized capital market.     Back in the early 2000s, internet and mobile communications disrupted the exchange of data by democratizing access to information. Now, the next step is the disruption of the exchange of value by democratizing access to capital. This disruption found its root two decades ago with online payment systems such as PayPal and opened the door to digital banks and their consequential disruption of retail banking. It is continuing today with blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) and should have a similar effect on investment banking and wealth management. But this is where the similarities stop.  While we in the crypto industry have a tendency to liken the blockchain and crypto revolution to the internet‚Äôs historical development, there is one crucial difference we‚Äôve failed to grasp: The internet did its disrupting in a regulatory vacuum. It has taken governments nearly two decades to begin regulating the Big Data industry. This stretch of lax oversight enabled developers to create, evolve and innovate at a tremendous rate.  On the flip side, finance - including banking, investments and payments services - is heavily regulated, even more so since the 2008 global financial crisis. In the U.S., for example, credit activities are up to three times more regulated than the health care industry. Therefore, it is simply wishful thinking on behalf of some crypto actors to believe they could reach mainstream adoption without hindrance.  If we want crypto to not only thrive but survive, it is essential for the industry to first recognize the current failures in its ecosystems and be at the forefront of the regulatory conversation.  Some would say it is unfair for an industry as young as crypto to take on the burden of regulations that even Tier One investment banks find hard to follow. Indeed, it would be disastrous for the industry if it were required to abide by the likes of ‚Äúmarket abuse‚Äù regulations like MAR/MiFID II in the European Union or the Dodd-Frank Law in the U.S.  Read more: The Case for Collaborating on Crypto Regulations | Delphine Forma  I was a trader at a major U.S. investment bank in London, JPMorgan, until mid-2018, and I recall the years and cost that it took us to implement MAR/MiFId. Knowing how hard it was and still is ‚Äì just last year, JPMorgan‚Äôs precious metals trading desk was accused of spoofing and ended up paying nearly $1 billion in fines ‚Äì for the behemoths of finance to get it right, it seems severe to ask a young industry built mainly of startups, small enterprises and individuals to implement such compliance processes.  However, it is our duty to look at current regulations and initiate the conversation with regulators on how we can apply their laws‚Äô spirit rather than their letter. In the end, both the crypto industry and regulators both want to protect investors and ensure market integrity.  Read more: Coinbase Has Words for the SEC. Is It Listening?  This is why it is crucial for the industry to centralize its effort in one self-regulatory representative body from people and protocols that have a real stake in the industry, have a real understanding of the industry and have a vested long-term interest in promoting the mass adoption of crypto.  The recent Senate hearings in the U.S. laid bare what many of us already know; our industry and the actors within it are misunderstood. Regulators and governments worldwide must understand that the fintech and crypto industries are necessary for the long-term creation and distribution of wealth. In order to ensure that crypto plays as positive a role as possible in this endeavor, however, it must mature.  There are many ways the industry can improve accountability, transparency and investor protection, and there is now a chance for active players to take the mantle, rather than act as passive watchers while regulators and governments around the world have crypto under the spotlight. The industry must centralize its efforts to self-regulate, educate and protect the prospects of, ironically, the decentralized industry itself. The stakes are high but the industry can, and must, rise to the challenge.",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Amber Ghaddar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/08/self-regulation-is-in-cryptos-best-interest,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f4426e34b23b940a293909977547a4a572166fc0-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The token currently sits at a market cap of $650 million and a fully diluted valuation of $11.68 billion just hours after launch.  dYdX is a decentralized exchange built on the Starkware layer 2 network that features an order book architecture in contrast to automated market makers such as Uniswap or SushiSwap. Users can trade in spot, perpetual futures and margin markets on multiple trading pairs.  The DYDX token is a governance and utility token. DYDX can be used to vote on governance proposals, and it also confers trading fee and market making fee reductions proportional to DYDX holdings.  In the hours since trading unlocked, the token price had been extremely volatile. Crypto asset tracking website CoinGecko showed the DYDX price launched as high as $14, and there is a significant spread between centralized and decentralized exchanges. At the time of writing, the price on OKEx sits at $13.71, while Sushi‚Äôs DYDX/ETH pool prices the token at the equivalent of $11.71.  Reports from Twitter indicate that some users received airdrops worth over $50,000. Eligibility required trading on the exchange in the last three years. CoinDesk has reached out to the dYdX team to confirm the median airdrop amount, but they did not respond by press time.  Users who traded using an IP address within the United States are not eligible for the airdrop or participation in the staking program, apparently due to concerns about securities laws. This has caused significant consternation on Twitter.  Users outside of the United States can earn tokens through a variety of liquidity mining programs currently underway. Trades placed on the exchange will earn tokens, and there are also liquidity provision and security module staking rewards planned.  On Twitter, users have reported the front end for the security module staking contract has been disabled, as users have not been receiving staked DYDX tokens (stkDYDX) to represent their share of the insurance pool.  ‚ÄúNo user funds are at risk, and all funds are recoverable,‚Äù wrote a team member on the exchange‚Äôs official Discord.",POSITIVE,DYDX,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | DYDX | AIRDROP,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/08/users-celebrate-massive-dydx-token-airdrop-as-transfer-restrictions-lift,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8a4c26e18065d064d73042ef852e3b2d53455ced-799x533.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Users can now stake on Solana and in return get new stSOL tokens that they can use to participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) projects on the blockchain, even when their staked tokens are locked up, according to a press release Wednesday.  Holders of stSOL could trade these derivative tokens or use them as collateral in DeFi, thereby generating additional yield. Staking, which involves locking crypto holdings to support the security and operations of a blockchain network in return for rewards, is perceived as less energy-intensive and potentially more scalable than the proof-of-work system that Bitcoin relies on.  Lido aims to have stSOL widely accepted as collateral in the DeFi ecosystem on Solana and other blockchains.  ‚ÄúThere is the wormhole bridge that connects Solana with other leading blockchains such as Terra and Ethereum,‚Äù Felix Lutsch, chief commercial officer at Chorus One, told CoinDesk in a Zoom call. ‚ÄúThe plan is to make use of that bridge to bring Lido staked assets from one chain to another.‚Äù Chorus One, a staking and interoperability solutions provider for over 20 decentralized networks, is building Lido‚Äôs liquid staking solution for Solana.

42394443,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdYkD,1631115940,Coinbase Has Words for the SEC. Is It Listening?,"Coinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange and one of the largest publicly traded cryptocurrency firms in the world, announced late Tuesday night that it has received a warning from the Securities and Exchange Commission about its planned Lend product, which would give users 4% interest on deposits of the stablecoin USDC, with other assets apparently to be added later. According to Coinbase, the U.S. regulatory agency last Wednesday sent the firm what‚Äôs known as a Wells notice, a warning of a planned lawsuit over the product.  (Disclosure: CoinDesk‚Äôs parent company, Digital Currency Group, is an investor in Circle, which issues USDC.)  But, according to Coinbase, the warning, which will likely block the launch of the Lend product, was issued after months of borderline stonewalling by the regulator. According to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, that began as early as May, when he visited Washington, D.C., to meet with various lawmakers and regulators.  ‚ÄúThe SEC was the only regulator that refused to meet with me, saying ‚Äòwe‚Äôre not meeting with any crypto companies,‚Äô‚Äù Armstrong wrote in a Twitter thread last night.  According to a blog post from Coinbase, the company has since presented the Lend product to the SEC and engaged in a long disclosure process before last week‚Äôs warning. Despite that effort at transparency, Armstrong says the SEC did not respond with any advice on how to properly structure the product ahead of issuing its Wells warning.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre being threatened with legal action before a single bit of actual guidance has been given to the industry on these products,‚Äù Armstrong wrote.  Coinbase argues, plausibly, that Lend is not a security, because its returns are not formally tied to the company‚Äôs financial performance. Equally frustrating for the now-public startup is that similar products are widespread in the cryptosphere, offered by effectively unregulated entities including exchanges and DeFi protocols.  Other U.S.-regulated crypto companies have responded with empathy and frustration. ‚ÄúU.S. regulators are beating down good actors because it‚Äôs convenient,‚Äù wrote Jesse Powell, CEO of the Kraken crypto exchange. ‚ÄúMeanwhile, actual scams run unabated for years.‚Äù  Armstrong also questioned whether the SEC is really doing its job. ‚ÄúWho are they protecting here and where is the harm? People seem pretty happy to be earning yield on these various products, across lots of other crypto companies ‚Ä¶ Shutting these down would arguably be harming consumers more than protecting them.‚Äù  Armstrong is misdirecting here, at least slightly. The SEC is oriented towards protecting investors from risk, and whatever the returns on an unregulated crypto deposit product might be today, they are clearly very high risk on a longer timeline. Massive hacks of both DeFi products and exchanges remain disturbingly frequent, for instance.  Whenever you get interest, you‚Äôre essentially getting paid for your risk. And like it or not, in the current low-interest-rate environment, 4% interest on a stablecoin deposit implies substantial risk. With U.S. banks offering less than 1% on deposits and even 30-year Treasury yields under 2%, Coinbase‚Äôs offered rate certainly raises questions about where the premium is coming from.  In many of the DeFi ‚Äúyield farming‚Äù programs Armstrong points to, for instance, supposed yield is actually paid in a platform‚Äôs native token. That makes most DeFi ‚Äúloans‚Äù barely disguised securities because the value of the yielded tokens is based on the platform‚Äôs future performance. One plausible explanation of the SEC‚Äôs action is that it believes Coinbase is similarly subsidizing its interest rates from its own operating revenue.  That being said, Coinbase‚Äôs side of the story paints a disappointing picture of the SEC under new head Gary Gensler. As the exchange points out in its account, Gensler has repeatedly said he wants dialogue with crypto companies, but it seems he may not understand that that‚Äôs a two-way street.",NEGATIVE,USDC,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | USDC,David Z.

Algorand Token Sees Highest Price in More Than 2 Years Despite Market Sell-Off,"ALGO, the native token of the layer 1 blockchain Algorand, logged its highest price in more than two years on Wednesday, defying a broader crypto market sell-off.  The price of ALGO tokens surged 34% on Coinbase to nearly $1.84 during U.S. trading hours on Wednesday, according to TradingView. That‚Äôs ALGO‚Äôs highest price since June 2019 when its mainnet was launched. The latest returns are especially significant considering that prices for bitcoin, along with those for most other crypto assets, have fallen sharply since Tuesday.  Algorand is also the only token that has logged positive returns among the top 15 smart-contract platforms by market capitalization, according to Messari‚Äôs smart-contract platform screen. Tokens of other popular layer 1 blockchains such as Ethereum, Cardano, Solana and Polkadot have suffered declines by as much as double-digit percentages in the past 24 hours.  Many on social media are calling Algorand the next Solana because Solana has been grabbing headlines recently and its token has hit new all-time highs.  Data from CoinGecko shows that ALGO‚Äôs trading volume over the past 24 hours mostly comes from crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase.  ALGO‚Äôs daily sentiment also spiked more than 40 points in less than four hours on crypto sentiment tracker site Trade The Chain, Nick Mancini, the site‚Äôs research analyst, said on Twitter, signaling almost instantaneous trader interest in the asset. Trade The Chain calculates a token‚Äôs sentiment by capturing data sources around the internet and contextualizing them to sentiment analysis.  Similar to many recent industry favorites such as Solana and Terra, Algorand is a layer 1 blockchain project that‚Äôs considered a competitor to Ethereum. The blockchain, which was founded by MIT professor and Turing Award winner Silvio Micali, uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.

Adding in co-investment and sub-advised vehicles, 10T has raised approximately $750 million since the PE firm launched in 2020, much of which has already been deployed, the company said.  Crypto is booming and venture capital and private equity firms like 10T are raising large pots of money, such as Silicon Valley-based Andreesen Horowitz (a16z), which earlier this year announced it had raised $2.2 billion to invest in digital asset platforms and protocols.  Back in February 2021, Tapiero launched a $200 million fund called 10T Holdings to invest in cryptocurrency startups, along with partners Michael Dubilier and Stan Miroshnik, former CEO of crypto-focused advisory firm Argon Group. The $750 million figure is inclusive of the earlier $200 million fund, a company representative told CoinDesk.  10T‚Äôs existing portfolio companies include Kraken, Ledger, Figure, Deribit, Bitfury, Huobi, eToro, Figment, Animoca Brands and Helium.

42415229,Qdxg6jMEJ6GhmjUz49WnRm,1631106000,Large Investors Are Behind Binance Smart Chain‚Äôs Rapid Growth: Nansen,"High-value traders, not retail investors, are behind Binance Smart Chain‚Äôs (BSC) rapid growth, according to a report published Wednesday by the blockchain data firm Nansen.  Nansen drew the conclusion from blockchain data, including the active addresses labeled as big traders by Nansen and stablecoin transactions by value on BSC, the layer 1 blockchain supported by Binance.  For example, the value of stablecoin transactions worth at least $1 million counted for over 90% of total stablecoin volume in April when popular decentralized exchange (DEX) PancakeSwap saw a flurry of activity. As late as August, these crypto deep pockets still composed about 30%-40% of total stablecoin trading volume.  Addresses that Nansen labeled ‚Äúsmart money,‚Äù including traders who made more than $100,000 in profit by providing liquidity and mining liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and public entities that invest in crypto, have also shown increased interest in BSC.  As the chart shows below, as much as 7.4% of funds dabbled in both BSC and Ethereum, while nearly 50% of ‚ÄúFlash Boys,‚Äù or wallets that have made multiple DEX trades in a single, profitable transaction, are in both BSC and Ethereum.  ‚ÄúSmart money interaction is one of the possible positive indicators of a certain project or protocol,‚Äù Nansen‚Äôs report said. ‚ÄúInterestingly, as much as how BSC is negatively looked upon by some, data shows that quite a sizable amount of smart money addresses have dabbled in both BSC and [Ethereum].‚Äù  Nansen‚Äôs findings counter the popular belief that the huge success of BSC, which is supported by Binance, the world‚Äôs largest centralized crypto exchange by trading volume, has been fueled by retail investors seeking lower transaction fees. By offering cheaper, faster transactions, BSC has gained traction against Ethereum, the most used decentralized application blockchain, as transactions on Ethereum have become more expensive.  As layer 1 blockchains, both Ethereum and BSC specialize in smart contracts, which allow software developers to run codes that can automatically process financial activities such as lending and trading.  ‚ÄúOn average, the gas price on BSC is only 10%-20% of that on Ethereum,‚Äù Nansen said in the report. ‚ÄúThis is what made BSC so attractive, especially to the retail market with a smaller wallet or fund size as well as developers who do not need to worry about high transaction fees affecting adoption.‚Äù Gas fees refer to the cost of transactions on blockchains.  While highlighting the role that high-value investors have played in BSC‚Äôs success, the Nansen report also questioned how BSC will ‚Äúevolve and work on strengthening their position in the market,‚Äù as layer 1 blockchain competition intensifies.  Market participants said institutional investors have become more attracted to layer 1 newcomers, including Solana, Terra, Avalanche and others that have received funding from top venture capital firms.  BSC also has received criticism for being less secure and decentralized due to a growing number of ‚Äúrug pulls‚Äù or exploits on BSC, as CoinDesk reported. BSC‚Äôs security algorithm, known as Proof-Of-Staked-Authority (PoSA), is controlled by only 21 node operators versus Ethereum, which currently runs thousands of active nodes.  ‚ÄúThere is a trade-off between more decentralization versus speed, so we thought that 21 nodes run by the community is probably enough,‚Äù Binance‚Äôs CEO Changpeng Zhao said in an interview with CoinDesk previously.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/08/large-investors-are-behind-binance-smart-chains-rapid-growth-nansen,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d358be060d27ddf64fc2279b4584e746d277aed2-1500x882.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In order to connect with their communities, these companies took to Medium, Twitter, and Reddit. Even though most of them still rely on these platforms, the data there is scattered, which makes it challenging to efficiently navigate it. From the crypto enthusiasts&apos; point of view, up until recently, there&apos;s been a lack of a single, reliable source of information. One had to rely on platforms like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko to track the performance of their favorite projects, go to Reddit to discuss them, get the latest industry updates on Medium and Twitter, or watch influencers reviews on YouTube. So we were left with a disintegrated social landscape for an emerging market, which made it difficult for traders and creators to communicate, assess the information, or monetize their content - and this is exactly where Blockster comes in to fill the gap.

42415232,Qdxg6jMEJ6GhmjUz49WnQY,1631100300,"Valid Points: SEC Probes DeFi, Gas Fees Stabilize","There is truly never a dull week in the world of Ethereum.  This week, we cover the rise of layer 2s, a comeback in total value locked (TVL) on Ethereum and the Securities and Exchange Commission making its way into decentralized finance (DeFi).  While non-fungible token (NFT) mints and trading are keeping gas prices high, we‚Äôve been able to get a glimpse of the real effects of EIP 1559. The most notable takeaways from the upgrade are that gas fees are consistent, even if consistently high, and the burn mechanism works. As of Tuesday afternoon, over 228,000 ETH has been burnt, with a dollar value quickly approaching $1 billion.  Feel free to reach out with your thoughts and ideas for the newsletter by responding to this email or commenting on Twitter.  Welcome to another edition of Valid Points.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk‚Äôs weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.  Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk‚Äôs Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company‚Äôs choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.  Validated takes  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly opened an investigation into Uniswap Labs, the developer of decentralized exchange Uniswap. BACKGROUND: The SEC claimed it is investigating how investors use Uniswap and how it is marketed. Uniswap is a DeFi cornerstone, having the highest trading volume and being responsible for popularizing decentralized exchanges. Uniswap Labs delisted synthetic equities tokens this past summer in a move to avoid this type of oversight.  Coinbase plans to integrate Polygon‚Äôs layer 2 scaling solution to reduce high gas fees and settlement times. BACKGROUND: Coinbase users will soon be able to withdraw funds to layer 2 scaling solutions, which will make DeFi more accessible to the masses.  Ethereum hit a new all-time high for total value locked in DeFi platforms after a three-month bear market. BACKGROUND: Data from Glassnode shows that DeFi total value locked broke a previous all-time high of $155 billion. A much larger percentage of the value locked comes from stablecoins than the previous high, as governance tokens have yet to fully recover in price.  High gas prices on Ethereum have pushed users to layer 2 solutions, which processed more transactions than Bitcoin last week. BACKGROUND: The launch of Arbitrum and Optimism brought light to the demand for cheaper transactions that still use Ethereum‚Äôs base-layer security. Users are now able to reasonably transact with small amounts of capital and interact with most of the popular applications built on Ethereum.  Gas price volatility has slowed post-EIP 1559, bringing stability to Ethereum‚Äôs fee market. BACKGROUND: EIP 1559 was not aimed at lowering gas prices, but more at adding a measure of predictability to transaction costs. High-demand blocks are followed by a 12.5% increase in the base fee and the opposite is true for low-demand blocks, removing the possibility of drastic base fee changes throughout the day.

But what if people could also donate and receive a unique NFT, such as a digital artwork or a collectible, that in turn could be traded on an open market? This is the concept behind non-fungible token fundraising by charities. An NFT is an asset that has a unique identity and can be identified, stored, and transferred without using a central registry. Unlike traditional crypto assets, each NFT has its own identity, allowing it to be differentiated from every other NFT. This provides key benefits for both donors and beneficiaries of charitable giving. One firm pioneering NFTs for charities is Next Earth, which recently hosted the first Initial Tile Offering, or ITO, in which virtual land NFTs were sold. What Donors Get Out of It Donors can support charities more easily by receiving something of intrinsic value rather than just money: an NFT instead of cash or another donation form. Donors get something they want while supporting the cause: an NFT that represents something meaningful to them or their interests. Donors may choose to hold onto their NFTs as a way of showing appreciation for a good cause while also benefiting from increased value over time - just like collectors do with physical artworks or sports cards. Donors can also choose whether or not to sell their NFT at any point after making the...",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,ICO | MARKET,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/tHfgumto13D8Y59ntQraMiVCAQLB0bf5,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png

42415225,Qdxg6jMEJ6GhmjUz49WnLe,1631095742,"Bitcoin Trades Weak After Tuesday‚Äôs Leverage Washout, Analysts See More Price Volatility Ahead","Bitcoin remains on offer as market sentiment remains weak in the wake of Tuesday‚Äôs leverage-driven price slide, the dour mood in equity markets and negative crypto news flow.  The cryptocurrency is currently trading near $45,300, representing a 3% drop on the day. Prices fell by 11% on Tuesday and reached as low as $40,000 on some exchanges, reportedly due to the forced closure of long positions in the derivatives market and liquidity shortage caused by exchange downtimes and market makers going offline.  After a big decline and leverage washout, traders tend to be less confident or more risk-averse for some time. That often results in flat-to-negative market action we see at press time.  Additional bearish pressure could be stemming from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs (SEC) attempts to stop the Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange Coinbase from launching its lending program offering 4% annualized yields. That‚Äôs a significantly higher return than the 1.5% yield offered by the U.S. 10-year Treasury note and could bring strong inflows to the crypto market.  ‚ÄúU.S. authorities [are] standing in the way of innovation. $100 trillion of negative real yields on global bonds drives investors into high-yielding cryptocurrency,‚Äù Dan Tapiero, founder of DTAP Capital LLC, tweeted early today.  Lastly, risk-off in traditional markets could be keeping bitcoin bulls at bay. Major European equity markets are currently nursing a 1% loss on growth concerns, and futures tied to the S&P 500 are down 0.5%. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar is gaining ground against major currencies.  Bitcoin‚Äôs options market is signaling higher near-term price volatility relative to the volatility seen in recent weeks. The cryptocurrency‚Äôs three-month implied volatility (IV) or expectations for price turbulence over the next 12 weeks stands at 4.8% and realized volatility (RV) is seen at 4%.  The spread has narrowed slightly from 100 basis points to 80 basis points in the past 24 hours as realized volatility has increased from 3.8% to 4% following yesterday‚Äôs drop. Experts foresee more volatility ahead.  ‚ÄúGap between realized and implied volatilities has been quite large but typically that signals mean reversion which happened on Tuesday,‚Äù Shiliang Tang, chief investment officer of LedgerPrime, a $135 million crypto hedge fund, told CoinDesk. ‚ÄúI think that realized volatility will continue to tick higher going forward (since its look back data). Usually, a period of low realized volatility means a period of high volatility will follow.‚Äù  Babel Finance‚Äôs Executive Director of Investments and Trading Simmons Chen said, ‚ÄúBoth realized volatility and implied volatility are likely to surge at this stage. It‚Äôs hard to tell which is going to fall first,‚Äù adding that in theory, implied volatility should fall if the market calms. Note that volatility only means price turbulence and doesn‚Äôt tell us anything about the direction of the impending price moves.

As of this writing, any Bitcoin miner who successfully verifies a block (often after every 10 minutes) receives 6.25 BTC as an incentive. The Bitcoin protocol automatically halves the reward after every four years to limit coin issuance and ensure a maximum supply of 21 million coins. This arrangement ultimately reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are released into circulation, thereby creating scarcity. Although the halving process benefits Bitcoin investors, it somewhat demotivates validators, small-scale miners. As an improvement on the fixed reward rule, Jax.Network has come up with a unique universal reward system for miners based on the complexity of the mined block. Understanding the Universal Reward Function in Jax.Network Jax.Network has two native coins, JXN and JAX, which have different investment purposes and utilities. Let&apos;s take a closer look at each of them. JXN coin is mined on the beacon chain. It is issued based on the fixed reward system, which is more beneficial to the investors for speculative reasons since the coin becomes a deflationary asset.

42415228,Qdxg6jMEJ6GhmjUz49WnPK,1631061289,Bitcoin Miner Profits Remain High Despite Surges in Mining Difficulty,"Bitcoin‚Äôs mining difficulty, a metric that describes how difficult it is for miners to find new bitcoin blocks and earn rewards, has seen a small jump after its dramatic 13% surge two weeks ago.  At 00:05 UTC on Tuesday, the biweekly mining difficulty adjustment posted a 4.5% increase at block 699551, according to several mining sites. ‚ÄúDifficulty‚Äù refers to the relative measure of the amount of resources required to mine bitcoin. This measurement adjusts up or down depending on the amount of power consumed (or ‚Äúhashrate‚Äù produced) by the network at a given time. Bitcoin‚Äôs protocol is set to adjust the difficulty level every 2,016 blocks, or roughly every two weeks, to ensure that new blocks are mined at a stable rate.  Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works  Mining bitcoin is becoming more costly as mining difficulty has been driven up by the massive amounts of existing computing resources devoted to mining, as well as more competition among miners to find new blocks. However, the largest cryptocurrency‚Äôs recent bull run has offset the increasing costs and keeps bitcoin mining highly profitable, according to miners and mining pool operators.  ‚ÄúPrice is increasing faster than difficulty,‚Äù Daniel Frumkin, researcher at Prague-based bitcoin mining company Slush Pool, said. The good news is that the price is going up, which means mining revenue in fiat is holding steady even though revenue is decreasing in BTC terms, Frumkin added.  Bitcoin‚Äôs price appeared to have recovered from China‚Äôs crackdown on crypto trading and mining in late July. It broke through $50,000 again last week after dropping below $30,000 on July 20, according to the CoinDesk 20 price index.  Hash price, a measure of bitcoin mining revenue in fiat currency, hit the bottom during the bear market in the summer of 2019. Margins on mining operations have increased by over 80% since then, according to Nick Hansen, CEO of Seattle-based mining company Luxor.  Besides bitcoin‚Äôs recent bull run, the record revenue margin is also in part due to the State Council of China ordering local authorities to shut down crypto mining sites in May. This shutdown resulted in the retirement of roughly one million mining machines in China. However, those miners outside of China who were able to stay online found themselves much more successful - and profitable - as the field of miners competing to find new blocks suddenly narrowed.  Growth hampered by hosting capacities  The latest 4.5% increase in mining difficulty pales next to the surge of two weeks ago when the difficulty shot up 13%. The slower growth could be attributed to limited hosting capacity across the globe, said Azam Roslan, senior sales associate at New York-based miner hosting services provider Wattum.  As the lack of hosting capacity continues, mining difficulty may face slow growth in the near future.  ‚ÄúAt the moment, there is officially no available hosting space until global infrastructure catches up to the demand,‚Äù Roslan said. ‚ÄúIt is very unlikely that we would see new highs in difficulty until hosting supply stabilizes and older equipment gets back online.‚Äù  Chinese miners‚Äô exodus created a severe shortage in hosting sites elsewhere for bitcoin mining machines.  While miners and hosting services providers are scrambling to build new infrastructure, hosting supply has been far from fully absorbing all the second-hand machines from China as well as large quantities of new machines ordered by public miners in North America such as Marathon and Riot.  ‚ÄúFrom our continuous global search of low-cost and sustainable electricity, we found that there is an extreme lack of available rack space to cater to all the displaced miners,‚Äù Rosland said. ‚ÄúAs hosting space increases in value alongside mining profitability, every single facility operator is looking forward to expanding their existing capacity.‚Äù  More new sites would be in operation as early as December, while many won‚Äôt be able to host mining machines until the first quarter of 2021, according to estimates by Hansen.  Chinese miner participation?  The end of the rainy season in South China could be another reason that mining difficulty is slower than the last adjustment.  As some Chinese miners have secretly plugged their mining machines back online, the mining hashrate has recovered at a velocity that exceeded many mining pool operator‚Äôs expectations, according to two major Chinese mining companies.  ‚ÄúThe revenue margins are so high that they may be willing to take extra risks such as plugging back in China secretly, which we definitely think is happening,‚Äù Hansen said.  The rainy season in Sichuan province of South China during this summer has enabled local dams to produce large amounts of hydropower, which can boost Chinese miners‚Äô hash power with cheap and ample electricity. However, the miners tend to migrate to northern regions such as Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia in China to continue mining with coal-fire power as the rainy season ends in September.  Chinese miners‚Äô migration to North China might be slower this year due to the ban on crypto mining. That is another reason why growth in mining hashrate would be moderate in the coming months besides the lack of mining infrastructure, Hansen said.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/08/bitcoin-miner-profits-remain-high-despite-surges-in-mining-difficulty,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7bed893fa03cab01be148833804032dc3f81b8ee-5760x4320.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
