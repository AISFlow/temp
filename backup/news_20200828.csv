42422087,nAPHWRwYo7WGMD8VryKSvf,1598647335,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Climbs to $11.5K With Record Amount in DeFi,"Bitcoin bounced back from Thursday’s drop at a time when more of the cryptocurrency is locked in DeFi than ever before.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $11,511 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 2.2% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $11,231-$11,552  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price trended upward Friday, going as high as $11,552 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase. “Bitcoin has rotated around the most traded price at $11,500,” said Daniel Koehler, liquidity manager at cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin. “Looking down, the next significant support levels are $10,800 and $10,550.”      Read More: Bitcoin, Gold Recover After Jerome Powell Speech Shakes Markets      Jean Baptiste Pavageau, partner at quant trading firm ExoAlpha, says bitcoin’s recovery after gyrating $450 on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments Thursday continues a larger bullish cycle started earlier in the summer.      “After its recent fake breakout above the $12,000 resistance level, bitcoin saw a short-term trend reversal in its broader bullish trend started in June,” said Pavageau. “On the long term the Fed’s comments are very positive for bitcoin and the crypto markets as a safe heaven because of their limited supply.”      For 2020, bitcoin is up 60% while gold is up almost 30%. Investors often refer to both as safe haven assets.      On the derivatives side, the market saw lots of expirations Friday, with over $740 million in bitcoin options expired on the Deribit platform alone. The expirations were expected to induce some volatility; instead, bitcoin’s price steadily trended upward during the day.      “There’s still an element of absorbing what has happened recently in the DeFi markets and the situation after Powell’s statement,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for Swissquote Bank, referring to decentralized finance. He was “surprised there wasn’t a more aggressive move in the last few days, but it's also good to have some calm for a while.”      Read More: Winklevoss Brothers Say Bitcoin Could Reach $500K      OkCoin’s Koehler told CoinDesk bitcoin’s price could run higher to cap off the week, given where option strikes currently lie. “To me, we probably pin near $11,675 – sell a call and a put at $12,000,” Koehler said, describing a “short straddle” options strategy, which bets that volatility will fall. “This is due to the high level of open interest around that strike rate, which means a lot of premium will need to be reinvested,"" he added.    Yet more bitcoin in DeFi    Ether (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Friday, trading around $397 and climbing 4.8% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: DeFi Studio Framework Labs Leaves Stealth Mode With $8M in Seed Funding      The amount of bitcoin locked in DeFi, has hit a new high. Over 55,500 BTC is now “locked” in DeFi, which means it is being used for liquidity, gaining a percentage return or yield. This locked amount is the highest yet.      Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner for Tellurian Capital, which has been investing in crypto projects since 2014, says ""fear of missing out,"" or FOMO, is one reason so many ""hodlers"" are locking their bitcoin in DeFi.      “I assume the BTC holders want to participate in the DeFi opportunities so they will need to wrap their bitcoin into those applications to get some yield,” he said. “Too tempting I guess.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all green Friday.

You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Bakkt’s back? Growing institutional interest is helping to drive a recent spike in volume on Bakkt, according to its president, Adam White. Trading volumes for physically settled bitcoin futures on Bakkt rose to $134 million on Tuesday from a previous high of $132 million on July 28, Muyao Shen reports. Physically settled means buyers receive tokens at expiration instead of cash. “It’s not a bet on the price of bitcoin,” White said. “It doesn’t rely on an index price created from unregulated spot markets that are self-reporting their data.” Despite the recent surge, Bakkt still lags behind CME Group, a bigger, U.S.-regulated exchange. Data shows the aggregated daily volumes of bitcoin futures on Bakkt and the CME were at $279 million and $1.5 billion, respectively, on Monday.      Mongolian mining moratorium? Over 20 bitcoin mining farms in China’s Inner Mongolia have been stripped of electricity perks after a clampdown by the local government. A document issued by the Department of Industrial and Information Technology of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on Aug. 24, shows the government agency suspended electricity discounts provided by the state-owned regional energy trading firm, following onsite inspections that found many supposed data centers were actually bitcoin mining facilities. With the policy change, electricity costs could reach 0.38 yuan per kWh ($0.054), up from 0.26–0.28 yuan per kWh ($0.037 to $0.040), CoinDesk’s Wolfie Zhou reports.      Venezuela’s crypto economy A new Chainalysis report focused on Latin America found Venezuela ranks third in the world for crypto adoption, behind Ukraine and Russia. Venezuela has adopted a crypto-friendly attitude amid crippling sanctions and hyperinflation, though most retail usage is happening through peer-to-peer marketplaces, not government-approved exchanges. State-owned Criptolago, one of only seven exchanges with government approval, saw $380,000 in dollar-adjusted volume over the last year compared to LocalBitcoins’ $242 million over the same period.      Client centralization A “critical bug” has left 13% of Ethereum nodes useless, and it could take weeks or months to fix. Parity-Ethereum and OpenEthereum versions 2.7 and later contain a bug that stops nodes from syncing with the $43 billion network’s latest block. Clients are different programming language implementations of blockchain software, a way to strengthen the network by having concurrent yet separate systems running. This bug has highlighted the issue of client centralization, as Ethereum Foundation-backed Geth client now supports some 80% of the Ethereum network, CoinDesk’s Will Foxley reports.      Wild predictions Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, early crypto investors and founders of Gemini, believe weakness in the U.S. financial system and other factors mean bitcoin could one day reach $500,000 per coin. In a post on the Winklevoss Capital blog Thursday, the two set out outlined ""fundamental problems"" with gold, oil, and the U.S. dollar as stores of value. ""Even before COVID-19, and despite the longest bull run in U.S. economic history, the government was spending money like a drunken sailor, cutting taxes like Crazy Eddie, and printing money like a banana republic,"" the brothers write. They recently met with prominent day-trader Dave Portnoy and told him gold could be devalued if figures like Elon Musk begin gold mining asteroids.

This could signal increased bullishness about future gains, CoinDesk’s Zack Voell said.      Miners are holding more than 1.82 million bitcoins, an increase of roughly 2% in the last year, according to data from Glassnode. In fact, this is part of a larger trend, where the percentage of all inactive bitcoin (meaning it hasn’t been traded or cashed in) hit a four-year high last spring.      Thomas Heller, former director at leading mining pool F2Pool, said this was a bullish indicator, as it appears holders may be anticipating a higher price.      To be sure, no one is clairvoyant, but we’re talking about market sentiment. But there is another technical reason miners, in particular, may be holding: mining factories are in a cycle of deploying newer mining machines.      This phase in the “hardware cycle” means operation expenses have decreased, and therefore, so has the number of bitcoin sold to cover those expenses, Harry Sudock, vice president of strategy at GRIID, said. Presumably, costs would have spiked months ago, when miners were ordering the machines now being deployed.      As miners deploy new machines, they also enjoyed a 7% monthly revenue increase in July, according to network data analyzed by CoinDesk, thanks to recent price appreciation and increased transaction fees.

Market intel    Hedges grow Bitcoin and gold are reversing losses seen on Thursday after the Federal Reserve’s announcement of a more relaxed approach to tackling inflation sent a tremor across the markets. Bitcoin rebounded back above $11,450 on Friday, erasing nearly 70% of the decline from $11,594 to $11,141 yesterday. Gold, too, has risen back to $1,960, having dropped to $1,910 after the event. ""Powell's speech suggests that there is no end in sight [for the Fed's easy money policy],"" John Kramer, trader at GSR, said. Put simply, Powell's speech looks to have strengthened bitcoin's long-term bullish case, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reports.    Tech pod    WabiSabi lobby Privacy-focused Bitcoin software wallet Wasabi is working on a new protocol design, dubbed WabiSabi, to improve the user experience and privacy of the wallet’s CoinJoin transactions, CoinDesk tech reporter Colin Harper reports. The major design change would allow users to coinjoin with different values than their peers, a first for the technology, reduce the role of a centralized coordinator and potentially enable CoinJoin sends to other users. This process would operate in the background if it runs the way Wasabi envisions it, opening up the possibility to make “every spend a CoinJoin.”      Fee-less USD Coin (USDC) has integrated ""meta transactions"" to the stablecoin platform to eliminate fees paid to the Ethereum blockchain when sending money around. ""This enables people to fund their non-custodial wallets with USDC and start using DeFi/dapps without also having to own ETH,"" Coinbase developer Peter Jihoon Kim said. Adopted as part of a protocol update, USDC 2.0, the Centre Consortium also announced a new on-chain signature system, CoinDesk’s Will Foxley reports. Founded by Coinbase and Circle, USDC is the second-largest stablecoin by market cap at $1.4 billion.    Op-ed    Tech over laws Shiv Malik, co-founder of the Intergenerational Foundation think tank and head of growth at Streamr, thinks policies like Europe’s GDPR or Andrew Yang’s “data dividend” are inadequate for putting users back in control of their data. “[T]here is a way of fighting tech with tech that might also result in changing the underlying economic structures,” he writes, namely through open-source, decentralized protocols. “We shouldn’t demand a tithe, we should take back control of our data.”    Podcast corner    The Breakdown The Breakdown presents everything you need to know about Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole address.

42384591,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAhSA9,1598632895,Money Reimagined: From COVID Generation to Crypto Generation,"Last year, before a pandemic changed the world, surveys showed millennials and adult-age Generation Z respondents steadily developing a curiosity in cryptocurrencies if not buying into the bigger idea that the technology will transform money.      A Michelmores survey in the U.K., for example, found that 20% of affluent millennials – the cohort born between 1980 and 1996 – invested in cryptocurrencies, compared with just 3% for the general population. Meanwhile, an online Harris/Blockchain Capital poll found 60% of people aged 18-34, a demographic covering six years of Gen Zers and 10 of millennials, were “somewhat familiar” with bitcoin, compared with 43% overall.      But the results also revealed that, in the U.S. and U.K. at least, this generational pairing still holds much more faith in traditional investments such as stocks and bonds. The data suggest a cohort of crypto dabblers, not outright converts.      You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.      What will take this all-important group of digital natives to the next level? How might they see crypto and blockchain technology as diehard believers do, as the driver of an entirely new paradigm for money, investing and wealth accumulation?      Perhaps COVID-19 is the catalyst.      Consider the pandemic’s global economic fallout: the equivalent of 400 million full-time jobs in lost work hours, a mountain of deferred bankruptcies, government debt levels above or projected to exceed 100% of GDP. Just as the Great Depression shaped economic decision making for decades, the shock of COVID-19 will be felt for a very long time.      The future decisions that matter will be those of Gen Zers and millennials, who together account for more than 60% of the global population. I see their decisions leading them to bitcoin.    Attitude shock    I have two Gen Z daughters. One is entering her second year of college just as she ended her first: homebound, learning virtually. The other is starting her critical junior year of high school in the same situation. It’s hard not to feel they are being denied some key rites of passage in their journey into adulthood.      Yet, they are among the luckiest. A Pew Research survey early in the crisis found that half of adult-age Gen Zers (ages 18 to 23) said they or someone else in their household had lost a job or suffered a pay cut because of the pandemic.      Meanwhile, many millennials, the youngest of whom are 24, are facing life-defining decisions about marriage, children, home-buying, career paths and long-term investment strategies in a uncertain economic environment. COVID-19 has barged into this defining period of their lives. It seems inevitable it will reset their expectations of the future.      Already, per a Harris Poll study for Edward Jones and Age Wave, about a third of both Gen Z and millennial respondents foresee an “extremely or very negative impact” on their personal financial security due to COVID-19. That compares with 24% of Generation X, 16% of baby boomers and 6% of the silent generation.      Given that a currency’s worth as a store of value is dictated by how users view its value over time, deteriorating expectations about future earning potential will inevitably shape how millennials’ and Gen Zers’ think about the money they use.      Even before this tragedy, these two generations were primed for a major attitude shift toward digital money. Growing up with the internet, they’re more inclined to its DIY ethos and notions of autonomy, as the lines between user and publisher blurred online and gave everyone the sense that they had their “own voice.” It might not be that much of a leap for them to embrace the “be your own bank” mindset of bitcoiners.    What to do when yield Is zero    Expectations and attitude shifts provide a potential cultural impetus for these groups to change how they think about money. Now there’s also a financial motive, as stocks and bonds, pumped by unprecedented central bank quantitative easing, are delivering stubbornly low yields – their earnings as a percentage of price.      With central bank rates anchored close to zero in dozens of countries, checking and savings accounts are paying a pittance and government and corporate bond yields have plunged, in some cases into negative territory. Meanwhile, with companies’ profitability whacked by the crisis, stock dividends have suffered their biggest quarterly drop in 11 years.      The two-decade fall in bond yields that got us here was a positive development for those who owned them because a decline entails a rise in price delivering a capital gain. Very few of those owners were millennials and even fewer, if any, Gen Zers. Rather, the benefits accrued to older Generation Xers and baby boomers.      Now, yields can go no lower. The younger generations can expect neither interest rate earnings or capital upside, right when they are primed to invest in these markets for the next half century.      This mightn’t matter if stocks were destined to rise. After all, low bond yields make stocks look attractive by comparison.      But it’s impossible now to argue that stocks aren’t in a bubble inflated by massive amounts of central bank intervention. Valuation measures are screaming “overbought.” In addition to plunging dividend yields, the S&P 500 median price-earnings ratio has never been higher.      If this is the top, millennials and Gen Zers have nothing left to buy. The same goes for home prices, now completely out of their range and with future gains curtailed by the lower-bound limits on near-rock-bottom mortgage rates.    No infinite treadmill    If the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan could keep up the trillions of dollars of new money creation ad infinitum, maybe this treadmill could go on forever. P/E ratios would go into the stratosphere and millennials and Gen Zers would just hitch themselves to the ongoing stock market inflation, passing the risk onto whatever generation is coming up behind them.      At a minimum that would require a continuation of the best-of-both-worlds conditions that have sustained stocks for almost three decades: low inflation and solid economic growth.      COVID-19 – and the policy response it is encouraging – will, I believe, render both impossible. The handling of the pandemic has severely hurt global confidence in the U.S. government, while the Fed’s monetary expansion (essentially confirmed by a policy shift announced Thursday), has undermined confidence in the dollar, generating inflation. Meanwhile, the blow to growth from the lockdown and future constraints on travel and work, coupled with ballooning debt levels that must be reined in, will make it much harder for businesses and governments to fund themselves.      In short, inflation will outstrip both bond yields and corporate earnings for the foreseeable future, which means a loss in real terms. That, clearly, is bad news for millennials and Gen Zers who are looking for a reliable way to accumulate wealth for the future.      More fundamentally, that loss-making equation will challenge their very faith in the fiat currencies in which they currently save.      Will that lead them to store value in bitcoin, which earns no nominal interest on its own? Maybe.      If younger generations can accept bitcoin’s promise of digital scarcity and censorship resistance and value its protection against currency debasement, political uncertainty, confiscation and economic dependency, it will look increasingly valuable relative to the low yields on overvalued fiat-based assets.      Ultimately, it’s the millennials' and Gen Zers’ prerogative. Do they throw their lot in with the old monetary system of the boomers and Gen Xers, or build themselves a new one that serves their interests?    50 Years of Fiat Yields    Doing research for this week’s column, I took a look at a long-cycle trend for 10-year bond yields. Fifty years seemed like the right time frame, given that next year around this time the world will mark the half-century anniversary of the “Nixon Shock,” the moment when President Richard Nixon removed the dollar from its peg to gold and single-handedly created the fiat money era.      What we see in the first 10 years of the chart below (courtesy of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s fabulous FRED service) is the initial impact of that dramatic change. Coupled with the OPEC oil embargo, the arrival of floating currencies triggered a frightening surge in inflation, which ultimately forced Fed Chairman Paul Volcker to jack up interest rates to nose-bleed levels. That meant the yield on the 10-year Treasury note also soared as the cost of borrowing money climbed. Volcker’s painful move triggered two recessions in quick succession – recessions are marked in gray on FRED charts – in the early 1980s. But once he’d broken the back of inflation and established a sense of solid trust in central bank independence as a principle, a period known as the “Great Moderation” began. Inflation fell and yields came down. And it didn’t stop for 40 years.      For a long time, this was, quite reasonably, seen as a good thing. Killing inflation and lowering borrowing costs established the conditions for a long period of U.S. economic growth. It paid for the United States’ victory in the Cold War, which in turn paved the way for a new American-modeled version of global capitalism, which poured money into emerging markets.      But the enthusiasm it generated also bred a more pernicious boom-bust cycle as a series of crises, especially in those emerging markets, demonstrated the vulnerability of global investors to credit risks in an increasingly interconnected world. In the 1990s, that ushered in an era in which central banks – especially the Fed – were seen not only as managers of price conditions but as market backstops in times of uncertainty and panic. (Background reading: “The Greenspan Put.”) It reached a crescendo with the global financial crisis of 2008 and its aftermath. That’s when the Fed drove rates down to their final bottom limit, the “zero bound,” but still saw a need to stimulate a shell-shocked economy, creating trillions of dollars in bank reserves via an unprecedented “quantitative easing” policy.      Now, amid a new crisis, we’re back there again, with the Fed issuing even greater amounts of new money, propping up the stock market, and wondering what more it can do to stop things from falling apart. Why the concern? Why not just let the market retrace? Because it could trigger a reversal in that 40-year rally in bond prices – the flipside of the slide in yields – a situation that some see as the biggest, most dangerous bubble in the world. Those U.S. government bonds are held by all the world’s central banks and commercial banks in huge quantities, where they provide sought-after collateral for all sorts of secondary loans. If that house of cards was to fall, it might have a bigger impact than even the Nixon Shock.    Global town hall    BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR. During one of the finance industry’s most heavily anticipated speeches, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell dropped news of a significant policy shift. From now on, the Fed will not just target inflation around 2% but will do so on an average basis over longer periods. In other words, to compensate for periods in which inflation is too low, it will tolerate a rate above 2% for a longer period. While Powell was clear that the Fed can dial up monetary tightening at any time, that it will prioritize employment goals over those of inflation, and that it’s not bound to a fixed time frame, the key question here is what this new message does to people’s inflation expectations. Can the Fed manage them?      These kinds of announcements are often designed to manage expectations and demonstrate the Fed’s commitment to its objectives. The policy itself is not the only tool. Announcing the policy itself signals intent – like saying, “See, your fears that we are going to suddenly withdraw monetary easing are unwarranted: We’re so committed to doing all we can to keep borrowing rates low that we’re pledging to let inflation go over our target for longer.”      But what if the messaging is too clear? What if the market reads this as the “Fed will create inflation, no matter what?” Inflation is a function of inflation expectations and of market confidence that central banks will protect the value of the currency. In an environment where confidence in government is waning, where gold is at record highs, and stocks are overvalued, will the Fed’s explicit promise to allow some degree of excess inflation inadvertently create a worse problem once the economy recovers? That’s the trillion-dollar question.      CONFUSED ABOUT CRYPTO? ASK THE IMF. This could have been cringey. The International Monetary Fund, a bastion of bureaucrats synonymous with the old-order fiat financial system, published an explainer video on cryptocurrencies. But in many respects, the two-minute piece, featuring a woman narrator walking through a field of animation talking about the problem of payment intermediaries and the “science of cryptography,” was a masterful effort.      To be sure, it didn’t dive into proof-of-work consensus mechanisms or protocol-based monetary policy, and it inevitably attracted mockery from maximalists who complained that it glossed over their favorite bitcoin features such as digital scarcity and censorship resistance. But as something to share with newbies, to get their heads in a place to start going down the rabbit hole, this is a surprisingly useful addition to the Crypto 101 resource list. We really shouldn’t be so surprised. The IMF has had an energetic and intelligent team of economists digging into cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies for about five years.      OMG OMFIF! The Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a think tank commonly referred to as OMFIF, includes among its membership many central banks, sovereign wealth funds and multilateral institutions (as well as private sector entities such as investment firms and banks), which gain access to new ideas around monetary policy, including on digital currencies.      So, it’s striking that OMFIF’s deputy chairman penned a lead article for its online publication with the title “Dollar Supremacy at Risk.” Philip Middleton’s argument will be familiar to readers of this column in that it ties the rise of digital currencies to a challenging macro environment marked by financial stress and international tensions. He writes that a “perfect storm produced by the convergence of geopolitics, technology, social change and the [COVID-19] crisis could bring about a profound shift” to knock the dollar off its perch as the world’s reserve currency.      Talking about this kind of thing was unimaginable in official circles a year or so ago. Also striking: Middleton’s suggestion that, in order to get ahead of this risk, the U.S. “might do worse than commission a Silicon Valley giant to offer a digital dollar to its billions of users worldwide.” A much friendlier message than a certain Silicon Valley giant received from central bankers a year ago when it proposed rolling out a basket-based digital currency to its billions of users worldwide.    Relevant reads    What Ethereum’s Fees Mean for Its Future. CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter brings a new argument to an old debate. The high fees the DeFi mania have brought to a now overburdened Ethereum network prove that public blockchains’ place in the world lies in acting as financial infrastructure, as the settlement layers for large-scale financial transactions; transactions are simply too expensive to play an effective role enabling non-financial data transfers or small, “cup of coffee” transactions. Carter says that Bitcoin Core advocates resolved themselves to this some time ago during the bitterly fought block-size debate with Bitcoin Cash advocates, but only now, amid the DeFi boom, are many in the Ethereum community doing similarly.       No Collateral Required: How Aave Brought Unsecured Borrowing to DeFi. The early phase of DeFi depended on taking cryptocurrency holdings and locking them in over-collateralized smart contracts to unlock automated credit lines that manage to keep asset values stable without the intervention of an intermediary. But what if the borrower doesn’t have collateral? Brady Dale explains how the Aava protocol has built a DeFi system that uses a delegated collateral system to allow people to borrow without putting down assets as security. Unsecured credit: yet another way in which DeFi innovators are trying to replicate traditional finance in a decentralized setting.

42384588,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAhS7d,1598628639,Fed Chair Powell's Flexible Inflation Views Were Already Priced In,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell did not raise many eyebrows Thursday morning when he announced the U.S. central bank would encourage some periods of inflation above its 2% target in certain circumstances to boost the long-term economy.      In remarks before a virtual version of the annual Jackson Hole symposium, Powell said the Fed was looking to bolster the labor market, though this is largely an issue Congress would have to deal with amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The current recession differs from most previous financial downturns because of its underlying cause; namely, lockdowns rather than the after-effects of an overheated economy, he said.      “If inflation runs below 2% following economic downturns but never moves above 2% even when the economy is strong, then, over time, inflation will average less than 2%,” he said. “Households and businesses will come to expect this result, meaning that inflation expectations would tend to move below our inflation goal and pull realized inflation down.”      Powell added:    “To prevent this outcome and the adverse dynamics that could ensue, our new statement indicates that we will seek to achieve inflation that averages 2% over time. Therefore, following periods when inflation has been running below 2%, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2% for some time.”    Thursday’s new approach to monetary policy comes after a year-long review of the Fed’s previous strategy, Powell said.      Read more: Commentary: Fed Chair Jerome Powell Details Inflation Target Changes      Ben Emons, managing director at macro research firm Medley Global Advisors, told CoinDesk the speech and the Fed’s new framework “basically matched market expectations.”      “For some time now the discussion has been moving to a more flexible framework targeting inflation,” he said.    Market stability    Both traditional financial instruments and hedge assets ended Thursday’s trading sessions generally stable, despite some price fluctuation earlier.      While bitcoin saw a price spike during the first half of Powell’s comments, it returned to the low $11,000s by its conclusion, and was trading around $11,300 as of press time, down less than 2% over the past 24 hours.      Bitcoin's price rose to the mid-$11,000s on Friday, up just slightly over a 24-hour period.      Traditional financial markets also experienced some slight volatility, but closed their trading sessions less than 1% away from their starting points.    Employment concerns    Powell noted that Congress would have to target the unemployment rate, Emons said.      “So the message here today is really that if the economy recovers we’re going to see more inflation, and if employment improves we’re going to allow this to continue as long as possible,” he said. “The Fed’s not going to lean against it.”      During his speech, Powell said the labor market would be “strongly influenced by non-monetary factors” such as the path of the coronavirus and any lasting changes in the business landscape.      For crypto traders, the big question will be how inflation impacts upon the prices of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether. Should the dollar weaken, the price of these cryptocurrencies should climb.      However, Powell also addressed the trust factor when it comes to major centralized institutions like central banks.      “Public faith in large institutions around the world is under pressure,” he said. “I think institutions like the Fed have to aggressively seek transparency and accountability to preserve our democratic legitimacy.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/28/fed-chair-powells-flexible-inflation-views-were-already-priced-in,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7f55c16d77f8f454a753e2a34792aa715fcd69c9-1685x849.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A new strategic partnership will see the firm implement Denver, Colo.-based Crusoe Energy Systems’ digital flare mitigation technology.  This converts waste natural gas that would be otherwise released into the atmosphere into electricity at the well site.  The operation will harness outflow at Equinor’s operations on the Bakken oilfield in North Dakota.  “Historically, industry’s options for reducing flaring have been limited to costly measures like new infrastructure development or shutting in production,” reads the memo shared internally at Equinor.  Crusoe’s digital flare mitigation “offers a win-win alternative for producers and investors alike,” it continued.  ""Mining cryptocurrency requires a lot of electricity to power computers, while a valuable commodity is wasted, and carbon emissions are created when we flare,"" said Lionel Ribeiro, manager sustainability at Global Unconventionals at Equinor. ""By connecting these inverse pains, we can satisfy both needs with no cost to market expense.""  In December 2019, the originally bootstrapped Crusoe announced $70 million in funding for expansion of its innovative flaring solutions.  The round was led by Bain Capital and joined by Founders Fund, Winklevoss Capital and Polychain Capital.  Before partnering with Equinor, Crusoe already operated flaring systems in Colorado, Wyoming and Montana.  Equinor is a state-owned multinational based in Norway and ranked as the 11th largest oil and gas firm globally.

42384571,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAhRq1,1598622087,Japanese Financial Giant SBI Holdings Launches Short-Term Crypto Derivatives,"Japanese financial firm SBI Holdings is launching trading for a type of cryptocurrency derivative called contracts for difference, or CFDs.    Already live on its foreign exchange trading platform, SBI FX Trade, the contracts come in bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and XRP flavors.  The firm said in an announcement Friday that traders can pair the crypto assets with both the U.S. dollar and the yen, meaning there are six CFD choices in total.  Orders can be placed from around 15 yen ($0.14) to a maximum open position of 500 bitcoin ($5.73 million at press time), for the BTC/JPY pair.  SBI Holdings said it also has a mobile app for the CFD trading and orders can be placed around the clock on any day of the week.  Users can make use of leverage – in effect, borrowing from the platform – to make trades.  CFDs are very short-term contracts that pay the difference in price between the open and closing trades.  They are not without controversy and a U.K. financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), has said it plans to ban these types of derivatives for retail traders.  The FCA said last year that such financial products are “ill-suited” to retail investors “who cannot reliably assess the value and risks of derivatives or ETNs that reference certain cryptoassets.”  SBI Holdings specifically said in its announcement it will be catering to both beginner and expert traders.

42384593,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAhSCf,1598620498,First Mover: Binance's Shrinking Trading Spreads and Bitcoin's Jackson Hole Fizzle,"Price point    Bitcoin was rising along with gold and U.S. stock futures early Friday as traders reacted to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's plan to let inflation run hot in coming years as the economy heals from the coronavirus-induced recession.      The largest cryptocurrency, seen by some investors as a hedge against inflation, changed hands around $11,451, staying in the range between $10,900 and $12,400, where it has been stuck since late July.      In Asian markets, the Japanese yen jumped on haven buying after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has pursued inflation-boosting policies, said he would resign due to an illness.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.    Market moves    Getting in and out of a large bitcoin trade on cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance or BitMEX isn’t costing as much as it used to. That might be a healthy sign that digital-asset markets are maturing.      At Binance, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, the daily average spread between buy and sell orders on bitcoin futures for $10 million quote size declined to a record low of 0.25% on Monday, according to data provided by research firm Skew. The spread, which typically narrows as an exchange’s order book depth increases, spiked to 7.95% during the March crash but dropped shortly after. It has been in a declining trend ever since.      The so-called bid/offer spread is the difference between the best available price to sell or buy something in a market. It essentially represents liquidity – the degree to which an asset can be quickly bought or sold on a marketplace at stable prices.      A narrower spread implies a deeper market where there is sufficient volume of open orders so buyers and sellers can execute a trade without causing a big change in the price. That’s in contrast to a weak liquidity environment, where large orders tend to move the price, increasing the cost of executing trades, and deterring traders – especially institutions – and, in turn, causing a further decline in liquidity.      Binance and BitMEX offering record low spread on a $10 million quote is a healthy market development, according to Denis Vinokourov, head of research at London-based crypto prime broker Bequant.      “The tighter the spread, the deeper the order book, the more the market is able to withstand shocks [price volatility],” Vinokourov told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin and gold are reversing losses seen on Thursday following Federal Reserve’s (Fed) announcement of a more relaxed approach to fighting inflation.    The top cryptocurrency has recovered to levels above $11,450 on Friday, erasing nearly 70% of the post-Fed decline from $11,594 to $11,141, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  Gold, too, has risen back to $1,960, having dropped from $1,976 to $1,910 following Powell's inflation speech, as per data source TradingView.  Both assets fell on Thursday, as the U.S. dollar gained ground despite the Fed unveiling an aggressive inflation strategy.  The greenback, however, is facing renewed selling pressure at press time.  The dollar index, which gauges the greenback versus a basket of its main competitors, is currently trading at nine-day lows near 92.35, representing a 0.68% decline on the day.  ""Powell's speech suggests that there is no end in sight [for easy monetary policy]. In parallel, safe havens or dis-inflationary assets continue to offer investors an alternative from playing that central bank manipulated game, bitcoin among them,"" John Kramer, trader at GSR told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  ""Powell has shown that there is ZERO tolerance for deflation so they will do ANYTHING to stop it, and that is good for the two hardest assets – gold and bitcoin,"" Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor and Real Vision Group tweeted early Friday.  Put simply, the speech strengthened bitcoin's long-term bullish case.    Four-hour chart    While bitcoin has regained some poise, it has yet to cross the descending trendline hurdle, as seen above.  A break higher would imply an end of the pullback from the Aug. 17 highs above $12,400.  On the downside, $11,100 is crucial support.

42384576,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAhRwJ,1598613748,Winklevoss Brothers Say Bitcoin Could Reach $500K as the 'Only' Long-Term Inflation Hedge,"Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, noted internet entrepreneurs and crypto billionaires, believe weakness in the U.S. financial system and other factors mean bitcoin could one day reach $500,000 per coin.    In a post on the Winklevoss Capital blog Thursday, the two set out how, while historically strong, there are now ""fundamental problems"" with gold, oil, and the U.S. dollar as stores of value.  The twins point to government money printing in the trillions and borrowing between government departments (as the Federal Reserve buys billions in debt from the Treasury), as factors that will ultimately lead to inflation.  ""Even before COVID-19, and despite the longest bull run in U.S. economic history, the government was spending money like a drunken sailor, cutting taxes like Crazy Eddie, and printing money like a banana republic,"" the brothers write.  Further, the arrival of the coronavirus epidemic is also expected to raise the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio more this year than over the last 10 years.  The available solutions to this debt – a soft default, austerity or a hard default – are not pretty, according to the post, and would all further bring inflationary pressure and other problems.  ""While [COVID-19] has hurled us further down the path towards a soft default, the greater culprit is the U.S. government’s permanent and unapologetic policy shift towards a debt-monetization model to finance its operations,"" the brothers claim.  Moving on, the post points out that both oil and gold have issues, too.  Oil suffers from the fact that there is more supply than had been realized with the advent of fracking, while COVID-19 has made it clear that the industry is vulnerable to ""demand shocks.""  Demand will also suffer from pressures to move away from carbon-based energy to more environmentally friendly alternatives, they predict.  And gold... The Winklevoss' argument goes that, while currently a reliable store of value and"" the classic inflation hedge,"" commercial asteroid mining threatens that status in the future.  More prosaically, the precious metal also suffers from being notoriously difficult to transport, especially during a pandemic.  Bitcoin, aka ""native internet money,"" fixes such issues, they argue.  ""Bitcoin is not just a scarce commodity, it’s the only known commodity in the universe that has a deterministic and fixed supply,"" per the article.  This means the cryptocurrency is not prone to supply shocks that gold or other commodities might face.  With other advantages like ease of portability and strong security, bitcoin is 10 times ""better at being gold than gold,"" they write.  Since inception, bitcoin has advanced rapidly into gold's territory and, if the current trajectory continues, ""the bull case scenario for bitcoin is that it is undervalued by a multiple of 45.""  This could mean a bitcoin price in the region of $500,000 per unit, they say, though no time frame is provided.

42384578,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAhRxZ,1598612425,"Data Ownership Should Be About Software, Not Lawsuits","Shiv Malik is the author of two books, the co-founder of the Intergenerational Foundation think tank and a former investigative journalist for the Guardian. He currently evangelizes about a new decentralized data economy for the open source project Streamr.      Who controls our data? The capture of so much information placed in the hands of so few is the most pressing technological issue of our age. The problem gives rise to weekly privacy scandals, has super-charged the growth of trillion dollar tech oligopolies and plays one of the most decisive roles in democratic outcomes.      And yet, the solutions for how to resolve this huge power imbalance are still so piecemeal. One such offering is the open data solution; make governments force everyone to share their datasets with everyone else so all can prosper. But even Tim Berners Lee, the founder of the Open Data Institute, the most stalwart organization backing the open data manifesto, seems to have turned his back on this solution.      The privacy movement has had much more success. New privacy tech – search engines such as DuckDuckGo, ad blockers, VPNs and even fresher software pioneered by the crypto community, such as zero knowledge solutions, have started to gain popular traction.      See also: Tor Bair – How Decentralized Tech Can End the Privacy Crisis in 2020      Further victories have been won on the legislative battlefield. Europe’s GDPR set a policy standard for countries and companies around the world to mimic or adhere to.      But if it’s control of data you are worried about, then the privacy movement suffers from a strategic flaw.      The reason we have a data economy is because data is valuable. Not just in an overtly comercial way but, as we’ve seen with COVID-19, it is socially valuable, too. The generation and distribution of information benefits us all.      The best the privacy movement can seem to do for us is either blunt that transmission of information or protect us from it being egregiously abused. What the movement has been unable to facilitate is to allow ordinary individuals to actively share their data with others and, most importantly, share in the proceeds of an economy already valued in the hundreds of billions.      And that, in a nutshell, is why the vast power imbalances between “data controllers” and (to use the nomenclature of GDPR) “data subjects” remain with us.      The data ownership movement, a third route to tackling how data is controlled in the 21st century, is now making a resurgence. I say resurgence because it has an academic and activist provenance going back at least two decades.      At the forefront of this data renaissance is Andrew Yang. With real flair, the entrepreneur turned politician and crypto ally deftly used his presidential bid to promote the meme of data ownership to millions of Americans. And he hasn’t stopped there.      This summer he launched his data dividend project, radicalized the thousands-strong Yang Gang to the banner of data ownership and seems willing to take the fight to “the technology company boardrooms” or, if that fails, to court.      I’m all for data ownership, so I’m loath to knock anyone pursuing that goal. But there are more than a few problems with Yang’s strategy.    We shouldn’t demand a tithe, we should take back control of our data.    Firstly, suing for data ownership rights through the courts seems unsustainable and retrospective. When there are so many companies and so many different types of data, how many class-action lawsuits can one organization launch? How long will this take, a decade? Longer? Do we really have that long?      Battling corporate behemoths with a few scrappy lawyers might be the very stuff of Hollywood movies, but unlike the hardware of polluting factories or tobacco firms the tech industry is agile. These companies will move their data assets and change their T&Cs faster than the courts can offer a result.      Yang says he wants us all to share in a data dividend. But dividends are given to owners of an organization. So is the end goal instead a tax like the governor of California suggested last year, where businesses would pay the state or consumers if their personal data was sold?      Such a tax would only serve to legitimize the current power structures. Google will turn around to critiques of their monopoly hold and retort: “What’s your complaint now? We’re already giving back to everyone.” Assuming these taxes aren’t eventually lobbied away, for Google et al., it’ll simply be one more cost of doing business – but it won't change how business is being done.      But there is a way of fighting tech with tech that might also result in changing the underlying economic structures. We shouldn’t demand a tithe, we should take back control of our data.      See also: Jennifer Zhu Scott – You Are the Product: A Three-Step Plan to Take Back Control of Personal Data      In fact, a handful of (mainly) crypto organizations are doing just this. ImagineBC, Ocean Protocol, GeoDB, Streamlytics, and Streamr (the project I work for) use software not advocacy to create a more sustainable and disruptive solution to the problem of data ownership and control.      Swash, a browser plugin built on the Streamr stack, could become a contender to controlling how web search and url data is monetised. GeoDB is doing the same for the location data market.      Although, just because there are digital solutions doesn’t mean people have legal ownership of their data. The fight for data ownership needs to be built upon legal rights and computer code.      What the European Union has planned on this front could become a legislative standard. It appears EU regulators have recognized that GDPR might protect privacy violations but it has failed to deal with the economic consequences of data monopolies.      As an unofficial Yang Ganger, I’m disappointed he has opted for using advocacy and the law instead of pulling upon his friends in crypto and blockchain to fight tech with tech. He has energetically and articulately drawn tens of thousands of supporters to the cause of data ownership.      Let’s hope that movement doesn’t inadvertently end up making the problem even worse.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Shiv Malik,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/08/28/data-ownership-should-be-about-software-not-lawsuits,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/87f625c0720c12e6c148adb659ab42b2428d5daa-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384587,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAhS57,1598608997,Binance’s Bitcoin 'Bid-Ask Spreads' Tighten as Cryptocurrency Markets Mature,"Getting in and out of a large bitcoin trade on cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance or BitMEX isn’t costing as much as it used to. That might be a healthy sign that digital-asset markets are maturing.      At Binance, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, the daily average spread between buy and sell orders on bitcoin futures for $10 million quote size declined to a record low of 0.25% on Monday, according to data provided by research firm Skew. The spread, which typically narrows as an exchange’s order book depth increases, spiked to 7.95% during the March crash but dropped shortly after. It has been in a declining trend ever since.      The so-called bid/offer spread is the difference between the best available price to sell or buy something in a market. It essentially represents liquidity – the degree to which an asset can be quickly bought or sold on a marketplace at stable prices.      A narrower spread implies a deeper market where there is sufficient volume of open orders so buyers and sellers can execute a trade without causing a big change in the price. That’s in contrast to a weak liquidity environment, where large orders tend to move the price, increasing the cost of executing trades, and deterring traders – especially institutions – and, in turn, causing a further decline in liquidity.      Binance and BitMEX offering record low spread on a $10 million quote is a healthy market development, according to Denis Vinokourov, head of research at London-based crypto prime broker Bequant.      “The tighter the spread, the deeper the order book, the more the market is able to withstand shocks [price volatility],” Vinokourov told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.      BitMEX and Binance aren’t alone as other exchanges have also witnessed a steady drop in spreads over the past five months.      Spreads on Deribit and FTX have also declined from March highs, but still remain considerably higher than those on BitMEX and Binance.      Bitcoin’s price rally may be one possible explanation for the exchange-wide decline in spreads.      “Higher liquidity is largely a function of prices being higher,” said Richard Rosenblum, co-founder at GSR, a digital assets trading firm. “At the $12,000 price range, if you have the same amount of tokens on the bid/offer that's three times as many dollars as $4,000 BTC, resulting in much tighter spreads.”    Spread compressions in several markets    The bid/offer spread on perpetuals (futures without expiry) listed on BitMEX fell to a lifetime low of 0.17% on July 18 and was last seen at 0.25%.      Binance consistently offered a higher spread than BitMEX before the March crash. Since then, however, the spreads have converged and pretty much moved in tandem.      “Bitmex's lead has reduced over other exchanges, largely due to reputational risk, following a raft of outages and tech issues earlier in the year,” said Vinokourov.      Seychelles-based BitMEX suffered an aggressive DDoS attack on March 13, which delayed and prevented requests to the platform. The outage was widely blamed for bolstering price volatility. It suffered another outage in May, but that did not create panic in the market.    Sign of healthier market    An important driver of order book depth or liquidity is the rate of change in prices. In times of extreme price volatility, spreads tend to widen and exchanges’ ability to execute large orders is reduced.      For instance, the spread for a $10 million quote on BitMEX, one of the largest derivatives exchanges by open interest, rose to 4.07% from 1.3% on March 13 – the day when bitcoin’s price crashed by 40%. Similar spikes were observed on other exchanges in mid-March.      Exchanges that are perceived to lack order book depth are often worst hit during times of panic. That’s because both buyers and sellers fear that their trade will distort prices on an illiquid exchange.      Sellers, therefore, leave offers at a discount to the fair price and buyers leave orders at a premium. That leads to further widening of the bid/offer spread and exaggerated price moves. In other words, weak liquidity begets illiquidity.      Thus, the record low bid/offer spreads on Binance and BitMEX are a welcome development; the exchanges have a greater ability to face volatility shocks than they did before the March crash.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/08/28/binances-bitcoin-bid-ask-spreads-tighten-as-cryptocurrency-markets-mature,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eaeb24d21e92b8b772480a293857202509c8e83a-2048x1639.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384574,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAhRtn,1598600923,"Bitmain, Ebang Among 21 Bitcoin Mining Farms Stripped of Energy Perks in Inner Mongolia","Over 20 bitcoin mining farms in China's Inner Mongolia have been stripped of electricity perks after a clampdown by the local government.      A document issued by the Department of Industrial and Information Technology of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on Aug. 24, obtained by CoinDesk, shows the government agency has required a local electricity trade company to disqualify 21 bitcoin mining farms from participating in energy trading.      Chinese crypto news source Wu Blockchain first reported the document, but did not provide the names of the farms on the list. Notable entities include two subsidiaries of bitcoin mining giant Bitmain in Inner Mongolia and another subsidiary of mining equipment manufacturer Ebang.      Also on the list is the Inner Mongolia Branch of China Telecom, based in the city of Ordos. That suggests the telecoms giant may also be involved in cryptocurrency mining activities in the region.      The suspension means these mining farms will no longer be able to enjoy electricity discounts that come from a liquid energy marketplace provided by the Inner Mongolia Power Group, a state-owned energy trading firm in the region.      Kevin Pan, CEO and co-founder of China-based mining pool PoolIn, said the policy will have some impact on the industry, at least in the short term. The electricity for these farms will likely rise by 0.1 yuan, or $0.014, per kilowatt-hour (kWh), he said.      The current electricity cost for mining farms in the region is around 0.26–0.28 yuan per kWh ($0.037 to $0.040). With the new policy change, the upper side of the range could reach as high as 0.38 yuan per kWh ($0.054), Pan said.      Such a seemingly negligible difference would, in fact, mean a significant increase of operational costs for energy-intensive crypto mining activities.      Read more: China’s Inner Mongolia to Shutter ‘Illegal’ Bitcoin Miners by October      If a mining farm is running at a full capacity of just 10,000 kWh, considered relatively small scale in the industry, an increase of $0.014 per kWh means the farm will incur an additional $3,360 in operational costs per day.      The document, addressed to Inner Mongolia Power Group, said the suspension notice came after the government agency conducted on-site inspections at over 30 big data and cloud computing companies in the region and discovered 21 of them are actually crypto mining farms.      The region-wide inspections started late last year, as CoinDesk reported at the time. The aim was to close down bitcoin mining operations that were without proper business registrations. They further targeted firms attempting to get electricity perks by disguising themselves as eligible entities.      According to the Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index compiled by the Cambridge University, China had over 65% of the global bitcoin mining computing power as of April this year. Inner Mongolia accounted for 8% of the network's total at the time.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | REGULATION,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/08/28/bitmain-ebang-among-21-bitcoin-mining-farms-stripped-of-energy-perks-in-inner-mongolia,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/463d8318a3e1c9a155affb5319269e63884e0f84-1500x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
