42422896,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qoNh,1600383035,Uniswap's Distribution Is Built on Something That Can't Be Forked: Actual Users,"""I think that Uniswap is one of the premier DeFi [decentralized finance] protocols, and its token is as well,"" Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO at Alameda Research, told CoinDesk via email. ""It has been the largest decentralized trading venue for a long time.""  The praise is noteworthy as Bankman-Fried is credited with saving SushiSwap, Uniswap's chief competitor.  Last night, the top automated decentralized exchange, Uniswap, dropped a share of its new governance token to everyone that had ever used it, even those whose transactions had failed.  ""In a time when people are being greedy and malicious, they did something generous and benevolent, and the fact that it was unexpected was really special,"" Meltem Demirors, strategy officer at CoinShares, told CoinDesk via text message.  With Uniswap competitors, like SushiSwap, hoovering up all the attention in crypto for the first part of September, Uniswap was widely expected to release a governance token. This was not surprising, but the fact that it went beyond rich liquidity providers (LPs) and rewarded regular users, that is what really got crypto talking last night.  Read more: SushiSwap Will Withdraw Up to $830M From Uniswap Today: Why It Matters for DeFi  It gave something like $1,400 (400 UNI) to all its past traders. Even more went to anyone who had supplied liquidity or who held its SOCKS token.  UNI party  Goodwill aside, UNI's distribution is no doubt also about securing the protocol's spot as a leader in DeFi.  The token is likely to kick off a fresh new boom in liquidity mining, the practice of rewarding crypto denizens who supply a protocol with funds it can use with a new token on top of whatever transaction fees they earn. Liquidity mining on Uniswap kicks in Sept. 18 at midnight UTC (the DEX has already added over $200 million in liquidity since last night, according to DeFi Pulse).  Everyone agrees the current mania for liquidity mining, a uniquely lucrative category of yield farming, kicked off in June when DeFi money market Compound began distributing its governance token, COMP.  But the progenitor of this new era on Ethereum told CoinDesk that Uniswap's distribution moved the ball for everyone.  ""I think it's genius in every way,"" Robert Leshner, Compound's founder, told CoinDesk in a phone call. ""They were the number one DeFi app by users, if I'm not mistaken. It brought a huge number of users into the fold.""  According to Uniswap, since launching, over 250,000 unique Ethereum addresses have made trades on it, and now all those folks will have some say over the future direction of the product. That said, they can also use Uniswap itself to instantly liquidate their holdings into whichever ERC-20 they prefer.  Read more: Some Numbers That Show Why Yield Farming COMP Is So Seductive  ""With their new token and broad distribution model, I believe it will significantly help them grow and retain their liquidity while building trust,"" Paul Veradittakit, partner at Pantera Capital, told CoinDesk in an email.  Emphasis on ""grow"": The real excitement is likely to kick in tomorrow – when rewards begin for liquidity providers (LPs), and so while this and tokens like it are usually called ""governance tokens,"" it's looking more and more like another term might be warranted, at least in this early era: growth tokens.  The real boom will run for a mere two months, through Nov. 17, with 83,333.33 UNI per day distributed proportionally to LPs across the ETH/USDT, ETH/USDC, ETH/DAI and ETH/WBTC pools.  In fact, total wrapped bitcoin shot up on Ethereum following the announcement that ETH/WBTC would be one of the four key pools.  Read more: Bitcoins Are Being Tokenized Faster Than They’re Mined as DeFi Craze Continues  It was a great night for a variety of leading DeFi applications that have been using Uniswap. Alex Svanevik, the CEO of blockchain data company Nansen, was able to identify some of the biggest UNI token claimers.  Svanevik told CoinDesk he was able to identify several wallets in the top 50 UNI claimer list, including those controlled by Aave, the money market; Kleros, a dispute resolution project; UMA, a synthetic token platform; and, notably, the SushiSwap MasterChef contract. The second highest UNI claimed by any smart contract was one owned by the payment service for adult performers, SpankChain, which first started experimenting with Uniswap in November 2018.  Deeper meanings  But boom times aside, those interested in fundamental progress in the space might look and see another clue. It's an open secret that Uniswap is working on a third version of its smart contracts, after only releasing its second version in May.  Ethereum insiders suggest mid-November might not only mark the end of the first phase of liquidity mining but the beginning of the next step in the underlying software, potentially kicking off a very merry holiday season on the world computer.  It could have been that Uniswap had intended to release UNI with its next major code release, but it's unlikely that SushiSwap and its later imitations forced the firm to drop a growth token it didn't want to drop, as some have suggested.  ""I think Uniswap was always planning to launch a token, and I think this was fortuitous timing,"" Leshner said.  Uniswap did not reply to a request for comment from CoinDesk.  Read more: A David vs. Goliath Battle Is Brewing in Ethereum Decentralized Exchange Race  It should be noted that while so far LPs have earned $56 million, according to the UNI blog post, in those 0.3% transaction fees, supporting trades on the protocol, none of those returns have gone to the company itself. As a venture-backed company it needed a way to repay its investors, and a token seems like the natural avenue for a leader in the blockchain industry.  ""You can make some good return in the near term and have a shot at a 10x,"" one Silicon Valley investor said of those who participated in Uniswap's $11 million Series A earlier this year.  If anything, SushiSwap might have bumped up the timeline, but it's unlikely that this was an idea that Uniswap didn't have already. And UNI is likely also important as a way of keeping itself in the good graces of financial authorities such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Rapid decentralization  The innovation in its distribution is in the fact that it went to real users rather than only to speculators, according to William Mougayar, a leading token investor.  ""This makes it very difficult for regulators to touch them (as Uniswap was very sensitive about that),"" he told CoinDesk in an email. ""So now we have gradual and proven decentralization first, followed by a sudden token, which is a perfect playbook that legitimizes the token model, while it maneuvers around potential SEC scrutiny.""  And notably, this distribution to actual users is something that only Uniswap can do and its several forks cannot – because they haven't waited to build a user base before beginning liquidity mining. Uniswap has been running since before DeFi was a term anyone cared about, building a user base to which it just sent a big ""thank you,"" and that could have dividends for a long time.  ""Community is currency – without a strong community, you don't have a currency,"" Demirors wrote. ""I think Uniswap gets that, and what they did definitely gained them a lot of loyalty.""  But, of course, what everyone's going to be watching in the immediate term is the price of UNI and the value being committed to the leading automated market maker (if not quite the first).  As Bankman-Fried of Alameda Research put it:  ""For what it's worth I think that the valuation implied by its current price is roughly in line with what I would have guessed compared to many other DeFi projects, and a bit higher than I would have guessed it would ultimately end up [being] compared to centralized exchange tokens.""  Disclosure: This reporter was able to claim 400 UNI tokens but immediately liquidated them.",POSITIVE,ETH | UNI,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MINING | UNI,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/17/uniswaps-distribution-is-built-on-something-that-cant-be-forked-actual-users,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1b08d666b251978d65ee3bb827ee8f60c28b91cf-1500x954.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $10,920 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 0.73% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $10,735-$11,052  BTC above its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin headed downward Thursday, going as low as $10,735 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase, but recovering to $10,920 as of press time.      Andrew Tu, an executive at quant trading firm Efficient Frontier, sees $11,000 as a key bitcoin price point. ”$11,000 has served as both support and resistance over the last two months,” Tu told CoinDesk. “If we properly break $11,000, we may head up towards $12,000 again while if we fail to break through, then we may go back towards $10,700 and then to $10,000.”      Thus far in September, bitcoin has been over the $11,000 mark twice, most recently on Wednesday prior to the U.S. Federal Reserve announcement of unchanged interest rates and allowing inflation to run over 2% in the near term.      Read More: Bitcoin Back Below $11K as Markets Doubt Fed’s Ability to Boost Inflation      Katie Stockton, analyst for Fairlead Strategies, sees a lack of momentum in the bitcoin market Thursday. “Today is an ‘inside-day’ for bitcoin, when the day’s high-low range is encompassed by the previous day’s range, so the action is not impacting the chart in a meaningful way.” Indeed, Wednesday’s bitcoin price range was wider, at $10,662-$11,099 per bitcoin.      In the options market, implied volatility, a measure of bitcoin’s forecasted price movement, is much higher than realized volatility, which is based on historical price changes.      This phenomenon has been occurring since July as options traders are increasingly hedging their bitcoin bets, said William Purdy, an options trader and founder of PurdyAlerts, an analysis firm.      “The historical realized volatility has significantly declined while implied volatility has increased as investors are increasingly willing to pay for more price protection,” said Purdy.      This is also happening in the ether options market, though not as pronounced as in bitcoin. Investors still expect an additional price boost from May’s halving, which reduced the new supply of bitcoin coming to market, according to Purdy.      “As we get later and later into the post-halvening cycle, traders are likely increasingly expecting a major price change and therefore expecting their already expensive premiums to still net positive ROI as they expect an even larger change in price,” Purdy told CoinDesk.    Ether fees rise again    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Thursday, trading around $388 and climbing 6.1% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

42384705,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAl8t3,1600373182,Uniswap Recaptures DeFi Buzz With UNI Token's Airdropped Debut,"Uniswap’s governance token, UNI, which was launched Wednesday night, has been on a roller-coaster ride in the past 24 hours, but despite the price volatility the total market cap of UNI could make the automated market maker (AMM) one of the most valuable decentralized finance (DeFi) projects in the coming years.      Based on 1 billion tokens outstanding and a current market price of $3.50, the project has an implied market value of $3.7 billion on a fully diluted basis, according to data compiled by CoinGecko. There is currently $829.7 million worth of crypto assets committed to Uniswap, according to DeFi Pulse.      Since its launch, UNI’s prices reached a high of $4.08 before going back down to around $3 as past users of Uniswap claimed their airdropped UNI tokens.      As a venture capital-backed project, Uniswap raised $11 million in a Series A funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, along with Union Square Ventures, Paradigm and a few other prominent funds in early August, and sold shares of Universal Navigation Inc., the company behind the protocol, to its investors.      Some 178 million UNI (about 17.8% of the total supply) will be allocated to investors with a four-year vesting cycle which, at the current price, is worth approximately $600 million.      When the exchange did its Series A round, there was speculation investors could potentially receive returns through a protocol fee of 0.05%, which was introduced to the second version of Uniswap. However, the fee function is currently turned off.      More than 50,000 addresses were holding UNI at press time, including the creator of its competitor SushiSwap, Chef Nomi. Uniswap’s token came just a week after SushiSwap migrated over $800 million in crypto assets from the former to jump-start its competing AMM.    UNI reactions    Andre Cronje, the developer of DeFi protocol Yearn.Finance, said he was “meh” at the surprising launch of UNI token. According to Cronje, it looked more like Uniswap was defensively responding to SushiSwap’s threat. Cronje’s project’s governance token, YFI, was traded at $32,038 at the press time, up a staggering amount from its initial trading price at around $32, giving his project a valuation of estimated $961.7 million.      Unlike UNI, there were no allocations of YFI to the project’s team members or investors, meaning it is governed completely by the users.      The total value locked in Uniswap went up 7.22% over the past 24 hours, while the figures for SushiSwap and Yearn.Finance were both down 14.28% and 14.48% to $631.9 million and $661.7 million, respectively, according to DeFi Pulse.      Many took to social media to praise UNI’s initial airdrop. A minimum of 400 UNI was airdropped to everyone who used Uniswap prior to September. Some called it “stimulus for Ethereum users.”      Major centralized exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase Pro, listed UNI within just a few hours since its launch. OKEx even went as far as offering a full set of trading tools for hedging UNI including spot trading, margin, swap trading and coin-marginated perpetual swap. Coinbase is among the project’s investors.",POSITIVE,UNI,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | UNI | AIRDROP,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/17/uniswap-recaptures-defi-buzz-with-uni-tokens-airdropped-debut,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aa6f520d9589cb25c0d6d158e7405b5f2a1e4d03-1500x894.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384693,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAl8bR,1600371855,Judge Orders Bitfinex to Turn Over Tether Loan Documents (Again),"Bitfinex and Tether must turn over documents detailing their financial relationship and history to the New York Attorney General’s office (NYAG), a New York Supreme Court justice ruled again on Thursday.      Judge Joel M. Cohen, the judge who has been overseeing the NYAG’s inquiry into Bitfinex and Tether, made the ruling after a charged, hour-long hearing on Thursday. Counsel for the crypto companies argued the document production order is too broad while the NYAG’s office argued the order is reasonable, saying Bitfinex has not submitted anywhere near the sufficient documents despite the amount of time that has elapsed since the case began.      Cohen didn’t set a firm deadline for when Bitfinex and Tether would have to produce these documents, leaving that decision to a special referee, but said a deadline would need to be set. As part of his order, he extended an injunction that would have ended in the next few weeks barring Tether from loaning funds to Bitfinex by 90 days.      Cohen opened the hearing by noting that the First Department – the appeals court that rejected Bitfinex’s last effort to dismiss the case – had specifically limited the role he could play in the ongoing investigation. Through the hearing, he refused to make specific rulings limiting the scope of the document production request.      The parties are expected to report the schedule back to the judge after the special referee makes that decision.    ‘Literally impossible’    “We ought to be allowed to push back,” said Charles Michael, an attorney with Steptoe and Johnson, representing Bitfinex in an ongoing case against the New York Attorney General’s office.      Michael was referring to Bitfinex’s effort to reduce the scope of a document production order the NYAG secured in April 2019, asking for details about the crypto exchange’s financial history and transactions with Tether, the stablecoin issuer with which it shares corporate owners and key executives.      Read more: NY AG Asks Court for New Order to Make Bitfinex Turn Over Tether Loan Documents      Michael went so far as to say it was “literally impossible to comply with” all of the document demands, because the NYAG’s office has asked for “all documents” around USDT.      John Castiglione, senior enforcement counsel at the NYAG, pushed back against the idea that the office is looking for all documents about USDT transactions, saying the department has specifically requested order and trade information, documents about evidencing purchases, tax returns and bank account statements – what he referred to as “core business documents.”      “If there are documents that don’t exist or systems that are no longer maintained, respondents should tell us,” he said.    Extended injunction    Cohen also examined the injunction he put in place to prevent Tether loaning funds to Bitfinex, asking Castiglione to justify extending it.      The government attorney said the respondents have yet to explain what happened to the first $600 million Tether loaned to Bitfinex, and he advocated keeping the injunction in place at least until more information was shared.      Specifically, the NYAG wants to know where the funds went, whether any of the funds went to company executives and why transfers from Tether to Bitfinex were necessary. Castiglione also said that keeping the injunction in place shouldn’t hurt Bitfinex financially, assuming all is well.      “Now what we have heard is, [Tether] started as a $2 billion tether reserve, [and is now] a $14 billion tether reserve. So it seems unlikely that $150 million staying on one side of the business would be catastrophic,” Castiglione said.      Michael said the conditions which may have justified the injunction in early 2019 – namely, that Bitfinex needed Tether’s funds to fulfill withdrawal requests by its customers – have been dissipated, pointing to Bitfinex and Tether’s profits over the past year and a half.      Read more: Bitfinex Doesn’t Have to Compile Documents During Appeal, Judge Says      “I think it’s very difficult to justify an ongoing injunction,” Michael said. “We’ve now had 17 additional months of disclosure. All the dirty laundry about Crypto Capital has been aired … Whatever risk there may have been 17 months ago is gone.”      Crypto Capital is the payment processor on which Bitfinex apparently stored its customers’ funds, without securing any guarantees about the funds’ safety. The operators of Crypto Capital were indicted last year, and Bitfinex has filed for a number of subpoenas to try and recover the nearly $1 billion it lost.      Michael also said the market has shown confidence in Bitfinex and Tether, evidenced by the fact that $15 billion tokens are in circulation as of Thursday.      “No one is at risk, there's not any allegation someone has tried to redeem and had any trouble,” he said. “There's no risk, whatever risk there may have been 17 months ago is gone.”      Cohen ultimately extended the injunction, but left instructions for the NYAG to advise by the end of that 90-day period whether it has sufficient information to determine next steps.",NEUTRAL,USDT,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | USDT,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/17/judge-orders-bitfinex-to-turn-over-tether-loan-documents-again,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1edfb944c4d34a6d3a435a76f12e9b4909a181cc-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384704,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAl8rn,1600360377,US Homeland Security Challenges Freelancers to Design It a Digital Wallet,"U.S. Homeland Security’s moonshots division, the Science and Technology Directorate (S&T), is trying to crowdsource a digital wallet.    Directorate officials are putting $25,000 up for grabs in their new digital wallet challenge, a user interface design competition to pair with DHS’s work in the blockchain and decentralized identity space.  Finalist wallets must demonstrate “ease of use and visual consistency, while supporting interoperability, security, and privacy,” said Anil John, technical director of S&T’s Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP).  Winning wallets could find a home inside DHS’ growing blockchain project portfolio. John mentioned how one DHS customer is implementing a decentralized credentialing system for issuing digital Green Cards.  Though S&T has been finding and funding blockchain companies through SVIP for years, it has never taken a design challenge to the public like it's doing now, Kathleen Kenyon, S&T prize program manager told CoinDesk.  “We’re trying to reach that freelance designer,” Kenyon said. She noted that while S&T has plenty of contacts within software development, it has less of a foothold in the graphic design community.  For a freelance target audience, S&T is offering a freelancer’s stipend: $5,000 to the three finalists and an additional $10,000 to the competition winner.  Kenyon said the rather low trove is sort of the point; it will appeal more to the community-level designers than it might to big corporations, and it also will let S&T run these kinds of competitions more often, she said.  Applications are open through Oct. 15 and the stage one finalists will be announced at a virtual SVIP event on Oct. 27. Judges will announce the winner sometime in December.

Prosecutors detailed Danil Potekhin and Dimitrii Karasavidi’s alleged heists, victims and target exchanges in a 30-page forfeiture complaint filed Wednesday against the pair’s previously seized crypto funds.    Karasavidi and Potekhin allegedly “deployed” a series of bogus Poloniex, Gemini and Binance lookalike sites that duped unwitting users into sharing their login credentials, giving the hackers control of wallets.  They then “drained” $20 million worth of bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and NEO from victims’ accounts, according to the complaint. Prosecutors said the lion’s share ended up in Karasavidi’s Bitfinex account.  Other funds were frozen by Poloniex and quickly seized by authorities, who filed the lawsuit to take control of 15,602 ETH, 199.8 BTC, $6.1 million in cash and 1,199 NEO, a total worth $14.2 million at press time.  That ETH haul was actually the product of a separate hacker scheme: market manipulation, authorities say.    In late October 2017, hackers pumped $5 million of one victim’s crypto into NEO’s Gas market, skyrocketing the usually sleepy token’s value 13,000% before ordering their personal gas-holding Poloniex accounts to cash out into ETH. The victim “lost virtually all of his $5 million in cryptocurrency,” prosecutors alleged.    Prosecutors also claimed the hackers attempted to cover up the stolen crypto’s origin by “layering” funds – a classic money-laundering technique.  Treasury officials said they used “blockchain tracing analysis” to follow the ETH from the Poloniex manipulation and the Poloniex, Binance and Gemini phishing schemes into Karasavidi’s Bitfinex account.  They further claimed to have identified Potekhin as the owner of multiple misspelled Poloniex domain names linked to the phishing scheme.  Similar tactics were used against Binance and Gemini customers, the regulator said in the lawsuit.    Karasavidi and Potekhin face a mounting lineup of legal troubles. This week, they’ve been added to the Treasury Department’s OFAC blacklist and also face federal wire fraud, hacking and money laundering charges.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/17/prosecutors-detail-russians-crypto-phishing-scheme-in-forfeiture-suit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2386c125bdefdc49215df786348567a77cbd9bef-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42384703,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAl8pH,1600359007,Ethereum Gas Fees Drive Gnosis-Powered Prediction Market to xDai's Layer 2,"This isn't the CryptoKitties craze of 2017.      ""The situation is different now,"" Stefan George of Gnosis told CoinDesk. Lots of dapps are clawing for Ethereum's compute power. If activity calms on one decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, it's likely to perk up on another.      ""Ethereum is on the way to becoming a whale chain,"" George lamented, one where only people transferring large values can stomach its steep transaction fees. So now Gnosis is voting with its feet.      The prediction market technology firm is copying all its smart contracts over toEthereum sidechain xDai. The move will include DXdao's Omen, an app for prediction markets, and SAFE, Gnosis' decentralized exchange (DEX) and multisig wallet.      Gnosis is a ConsenSys spoke that has built a number of different applications on the world computer. It's had time to do so after securing $12 million in an April 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) and then finding itself stymied in deploying its chief product as it attempted to secure regulatory approval for the technology.      Since turning its prediction market application (a way to gamble on the outcomes of future events) over to a decentralized organization, DXDao, and providing tech support for its implementation, Omen, Gnosis found that users balk at making bets with their friends when it costs so much to do so because of gas costs.      Read more: Prediction Markets’ Time Has Come, but They Aren’t Ready for It      ""Prediction markets are mostly seen as an entertainment product,"" George said. ""You just want to have really low costs, ideally no costs.""      Lately, Ethereum has been miserable in that regard.    xDai's moment    A sister chain of Ethereum in operation for the last two years, xDai is a proof-of-stake chain that enables fast and stable transactions for fractions of a penny each. It's been used at crypto conferences, for example, as a quick and easy way for attendees to pay for concessions using an Ethereum wallet, for example.      Since its core currency is dai (DAI), these transactions are made at predictable and understandable values for users.      Read more: Ethereum’s Pending Transactions Jump 30% After Uniswap’s Token Claim Begins      Any crypto asset can be staked on the xDai bridge and used on xDai, though George noted it's important for users to understand they are entrusting their assets to the xDai bridge, which is controlled by a multi-sig.      In its roadmap, xDai also plans to get fiat-to-crypto onboarding going in the next quarter, meaning users wouldn't ever need to touch ether (ETH) itself directly.      ""Adoption has really increased with gas prices, which are squeezing so many projects on Ethereum. It's a very dev-friendly, EVM-compatible chain so few code changes are needed to deploy to xDai,"" Andrew Gross of the xDai team told CoinDesk in an email.      While other layer 2 options are under development now (such as Optimism and zk-Rollups), in George's judgment, xDai is the only one that's ready to go, with adequate tooling (such as block explorers) for developers to work effectively.      Both George and the xDAI team say it's also becoming an attractive place for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) because they can run their votes there without incurring much cost.    Preview of Ethereum 2.0    All of Gnosis' products will remain on Ethereum for anyone that wants to use them there.      George argues that xDai is a good place for smart contracts to experiment with lower stakes. In fact, he contends the whole Ethereum community should use xDai as a place to experiment.      In a lot of ways, he believes xDai could also be a preview of Ethereum after sharding gets deployed and gas fees go down. In that future, dapps will need to create an asynchronous logic in order to communicate with applications on other shards.      Read more: Everything You Need to Know About Ethereum 2.0      Gnosis expects it will operate on the shard favored by DeFi applications, which will probably still have some of the highest gas costs in Ethereum, even after the new version kicks in. Using xDai, it will need to asynchronously communicate with its oracle network, which will remain on Ethereum.      And the risk is low. Gnosis remains long on Ethereum, but the whole point of this move is to make it easier for people to use Ethereum without a lot of money at risk, such as betting 10 DAI with a friend over an election outcome.      ""Prediction markets have not gone mainstream yet, many are still focused on topics mostly relevant to an insulated community,"" Gross said. ""With easier onboarding and lower costs, we can remove a lot of the barriers to entry for these types of applications and open them up to a much broader audience.""",NEGATIVE,ETH | DAI,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | DAI | TOKEN SALE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/09/17/ethereum-gas-fees-drive-gnosis-powered-prediction-market-to-xdais-layer-2,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7656efce700bf1e2c39c39b81ab9379c073e8fa2-1500x1200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Top shelf    Crypto’s bank Kraken Financial, a newly formed division of the popular crypto exchange, has become the first firm to receive a special type of charter making it a bank. On Wednesday, the Wyoming Banking Board approved the exchange’s application for a special purpose depository institution (SPDI) charter – making it a licensed bank in the state, replete with access to federal payments infrastructure and opening the doors to issuing digital-asset debit cards and savings accounts as well as securities and commodities services. Kraken Financial beat out Wyoming blockchain pioneer Caitlin Long’s application for Avanti Financial, and is the first bank established in Wyoming since 2006.      Non-public information The China state-sponsored Blockchain-Based Service Network (BSN), a standardized internet services provider for decentralized applications (dapp) developers, plans to make 24 public chains available in its network for Chinese users beginning in November. These public chains will look quite different after being “localized” for the Chinese market, CoinDesk’s David Pan reports, who gained access to a leaked memo. Inspired by Ant Financial’s permission blockchain, these chains will replace their native tokens with the renminbi, be renamed after the 24 Chinese solar terms and will be supervised by the Public Permissioned Blockchain consortium – ensuring the state reaps the benefits of blockchain tech’s traceability and efficiency, without the decentralization embraced by public chains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. “BSN strictly follows related laws and regulations and will remove any chain that violates them from the network,” the memo reads.      Welcome newbies New investors are entering the bitcoin market at a faster pace and possibly creating upward pressure on prices, on-chain data shows. The number of “young investment” wallets (those that are one to three months old and rarely send bitcoins) has jumped to 2,254,667 this month, the highest level since February 2018, according to data provided by the blockchain analysts firm Chainalysis. That's double from 1,162,632 six months ago. ""It looks like new people are entering the market, buying bitcoin and putting it in wallets for long-term investment,"" Chainalysis' economist Philip Gradwell told CoinDesk. Investors took advantage of the 40% price drop to levels below $4,000 observed on March 12 and have continued to pour money into the top cryptocurrency ever since.      Beefing up Wyoming’s chief banking regulator says he’s “beefing up” his division’s monitoring capabilities on illicit cryptocurrency with Chainalysis. Under a one-year deal, Chainalysis will train senior examiners on crypto tracing practices and grant two monitoring software licenses – plus investigatory support – to the Division of Banking as it eases into its new, crypto-facing compliance duties, according to Commissioner Albert Forkner. Those rules are no different than the ones governing traditional American banks: Watch out for signs of money laundering, don’t transact with sanctioned individuals, keep tabs on customer identities and uphold the minutiae of the Bank Secrecy Act.      Patent game Alibaba is on track to supersede U.S. computer giant IBM by becoming the single-largest holder of blockchain-related patents, according to a new study. Consultancy KISSPatent found the Chinese tech conglomerate has published ten times more blockchain patents than IBM, its nearest rival. Should Alibaba continue at its current pace, the study predicted it would become the biggest patent holder in blockchain by the end of 2020. The firm also found the majority of patents were filed by traditional Fortune 500 companies, rather than companies that exist wholly within the blockchain space.

After surviving the “vampire attack” fomented by its forked rival SushiSwap, decentralized trading platform Uniswap launched its own governance token, UNI, on Wednesday.      The platform has minted 1 billion coins to be distributed to founders, early users and future community members over the next four years. The token will be used to power on-chain governance decisions.      “UNI officially enshrines Uniswap as publicly owned and self-sustainable infrastructure while continuing to carefully protect its indestructible and autonomous qualities,” the firm wrote.      SushiSwap, a genetic twin to Uniswap, appeared on the scene as a real competitive threat – offering an incentive to participants to siphon liquidity from the dominant automated market maker (AMM). SushiSwap migrated over $800 million in crypto assets from Uniswap last week, with promises to be a fully decentralized rival to the “VC-backed” Uniswap.      Observers of the battle expected Uniswap to respond by issuing its own governance token. Though some may be surprised at the speed at which this was executed.      Following the announcement, the number of pending transactions on the Ethereum network spiked, and within three hours after the claim started, over 18,000 transactions were sent to the smart contract address of the UNI governance token.      Binance, Huobi, OKEx, FTX (which is led by Sam Bankman-Fried, who has played a pivotal role in the SushiSwap saga) and Coinbase Pro have all added trading support for the new token.      Both Sushi and Uni distinguish themselves from centralized exchanges like Coinbase by allowing users (called liquidity providers, or LPs) to deposit any digital asset onto the platform, receive interest and a cut of transaction fees in return.      Coinbase, on the other hand, uses the more traditional order book format – where a user's trade is matched up against a list, or book, of buys and sells, and executed at the best available price.    Market intel    Doubt prevails CoinDesk data shows bitcoin's price fell to just under $10,900 in the Asian trading hours – not long after it had climbed to near $11,100. The drop is bitcoin's latest failure around the key psychological hurdle and could be the result of prevailing doubts over the Federal Reserve's ability to hit the 2% inflation target. Prevailing doubts over whether the Fed has what it takes to hit its 2% inflation target hit traditional markets and may have contributed to a bitcoin price drop early on Thursday. On average, officials don't expect 2% inflation until 2023.      Found funds    PowerTrade, a mobile bitcoin options trading platform, raised $4.7 million via token sales in a round led by Pantera Capital and joined by Framework Ventures, CMS Holdings and QCP Capital among others.  ParaSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator, has completed a $2.7 million seed funding round joined by 32 investors including Blockchain Capital, Alameda Research, Arrington XRP Capital, Coinfund, CoinGecko, Aave founder Stani Kulechov and others.  Tech pod    Polemics and dots A token minting system – Polimec – is coming to the Polkadot blockchain ecosystem, promising to be a leaner, meaner version of Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard, the mechanism that launched a thousand token sales, CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reports. Launched by the team behind blockchain identity protocol KILT, the token issuance and transfer framework is thought to eventually spur development on the Ethereum-competing layer 1. “If you look at what ERC-20 actually did to the Ethereum ecosystem, then you can imagine what will possibly happen with Polimec,” Ingo Ruebe, CEO of BOTLabs and project lead for KILT Protocol said. “It’s an absolutely essential part of the ecosystem, I would say.” The KILT mainnet, an identity solution expected to launch in 11 months, will be the first project to mint tokens using Polimec.      Cascading blockchains Ava Labs is launching its Avalanche blockchain next Monday, Sept. 21, with aspirations of creating a new front for the development of decentralized finance applications. “Avalanche aims to enable new systems defined by velocity, efficient use of capital, and innovation in new products and services that aren’t possible with the current wait times to finalize transactions,” Ava Labs CEO Emin Gün Sirer told CoinDesk. “DeFi is certainly part of our motivation in the short term, with our long-term sights set on traditional finance.” The upcoming launch comes on the back of $60 million in funding, $45 million of which came from a July 2020 public token sale and private sale led by Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital, Bitmain and Initialized Capital, CoinDesk’s Colin Harper reports.

Ecological Sanity Is Compatible With Human Freedom In the early days, Bitcoin proposed a simple model of how the world could be transformed: The free market was going to produce inflation-proof money with strong privacy features, which could be used to avoid taxes. Over time, people would sell their dollars, replace them with cryptocurrency and the State would wither away to be replaced with an anarchic paradise.      That was one Bitcoin theory of change. It seems improbable now, as it did before, despite the current risk of game-changing inflation in America. The ship may be going down, and Bitcoin may be a life-raft for some (as it is in Venezuela), but the collapse was not caused by Bitcoin. It was caused by good old-fashioned mismanagement over decades.      Still, given the waste and excess in society, it’s never been clearer how much the world needs cryptographic transparency. So what is our theory of change? How are we really going to get a better world out of all this exquisite technology?      Our freedom rests on our ability to use technology to dig our way out of this hole: to increase our options by creating and deploying new supply-side technologies to create clean energy, and by radically re-engineering the demand side to hit our necessary consumption limits.      The creativity of the market economy works, but instead of mere “price signaling” we need high-quality, multidimensional data so we can run a multidimensional market: money, carbon, other forms of impact, all inside of a single global budget, with infinite room for human creativity to prove we met our targets and live as well as we are able.      Neither utopian nor dystopian, this is reality: You have markets, or you have authoritarianism. Carbon is a new constraint, and we either handle it like money and instruments well enough for creative response or face a future of blundering mandates.      Ecological sanity is compatible with human freedom, but only if we deploy cryptography to manage the resource allocation. My hope is that, by 2030, these systems will be ready in enough countries that they’ll become standardized across the world, and we can go on together. Read the full story here.

Earlier this week, Forge, a tech-focused subsidiary of the French investment bank, announced it was experimenting with the Tezos blockchain to gauge how useful it would be for capital market activities.  But speaking to CoinDesk, Jean-Marc Stenger, the CEO of Forge, said it is considering running trials on a handful of blockchains, although he declined to disclose which ones.  He added Societe Generale hopes to ultimately support up to five separate blockchains.  Tezos is the second blockchain tested by Societe Generale. Last year, the bank completed a $100 million bond issuance on Ethereum.  Tezos' protocol and consensus proof-of-stake algorithm as well as its on-chain governance and smart contract language will be utilized to test the use of blockchains for ""high-value financial applications,"" per a press release Tuesday.  Forge Chief Technology Officer Stephane Duzan said Forge chose Tezos because it provides the company with the freedom to develop features that would be much harder to do on older protocols.  Being able to work across multiple blockchains would also improve interoperability and liquidity for clients, he said.  The tech arm will also use Tezos for a central bank digital currency (CBDC) experiment primarily for interbank settlements – it has run in concert with the French central bank and financial regulators since the summer.

42432686,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0pZh,1600348676,Say Hello to the Singularity,"The current blockchain world is so full of crazy ups and downs, it’s easy to become so focused on the short term that one loses track of the big picture. But it’s important to fight this tendency – because the big picture is awfully big.      Revolutionizing finance, the aspect of blockchain’s future that gets the most attention, is only a part of the story. Blockchain will be a central part of the future of technology and humanity in a very broad sense.      As we move toward what Ray Kurzweil has called the “technological singularity,” in which AIs exceed humans in general intelligence and radically alter every aspect of life on Earth, it is increasingly clear that blockchain will be a critical part of the story. And just as the singularity may unfold with various levels of benefit or destruction, so the role of blockchain may come out positive or negative for humanity.    Ben Goertzel is founder and CEO of SingularityNET, a blockchain-based AI marketplace project. This article is a part of the Internet 2030 series, a look at the future of the internet and our digital lives.    It is clear to any rational observer that our current social order – with its rapid growth, exaltation of self-disruption and rampant environmental un-sustainability – is transitional and highly temporary in nature. But it’s hard to say what will come next! At least three options seem reasonably plausible to me: Corporate Techno-Fascism, Decentralized-Digital-Democracy (DDD) and … Human-Free.      Will we see a dark future of corporate-totalitarian hegemony, a democratic, decentralized future of diverse flourishing creativity – or a future in which advanced artificial general intelligence (AGI) tech leaves biological humanity entirely by the wayside?      In any of these scenarios, blockchain technology or its direct descendants will play a critical and distinctive role. But the role will be rather different in each case. Further, the ways in which blockchain technology is developed right now will be part of the nexus of factors influencing what sort of outcome eventuates for humanity generally.    Bear market for humans    What we are seeing in the global economy right now might be characterized as a bear market for humans. AI and automation are booming, and AI-fueled big tech companies are seeing their market caps soar. Businesses highly dependent on human labor are generally suffering, and often are reorganizing to reduce this reliance. Despite buoyant stock markets and financial innovations like DeFi, wealth and income inequality are increasing. Displaced workers newly joining the unemployment rolls seem likely to stay there long-term.      See also: AI Startup Pilots Digital Masks That Counter Facial Recognition      This is a bear market for the less educated socioeconomic strata of humans. It will only get worse. As AI advances, the threshold level of education required to compete with mechanical tools and systems will keep rising.      One potential endgame of the current direction of technological and economic development will be a world divided into: A lot of AIs, a small number of humans owning the companies that own these AIs, a small number of highly educated and specially trained humans doing the few things AIs aren’t great at yet and a whole lot of people with no particular role to play in the economy.      It’s true that new technologies both obsolete old jobs and create new ones. But the overall pattern is clear. On the whole, the new jobs created will be more exacting in educational requirements and fewer in number. Self-driving trucks will replace human truck drivers, while creating more opportunities for developers of automated navigation algorithms and designers of robots that repair robo-trucks.    Corporate techno-fascism or human-free robotopia?    It’s not inconceivable that, in a future where most people are economically useless to the few who own the means of automated production, these unproductive masses are left to die off. Perhaps there will be a reversion to some form of old-style subsistence farming in the sprawling rubble outside the gated robo-factories.    What we are seeing in the global economy right now might be characterized as a bear market for humans.    It’s also possible that “compassion” will prevail and the masses will be allowed to survive in a carefully controlled way. In this sort of scenario, blockchain will be highly valuable to the hegemons. (Think of the Chinese government’s blockchain surveillance strategy rather than the anarcho-libertarian visions of the early Bitcoin and Ethereum communities.)      Blockchain provides an extraordinarily good tool for maintaining centralized control in a large, complex network, like a global, corporate, techno-fascist social order. It provides unparalleled capability for top-level leaders to make sure that none of their underlings on any level are corrupt, and keeps detailed, real-time records on every member of the society they rule over.      As the percentage of economically irrelevant humans increases, blockchain provides a perfect tool for governments and corporations to keep chaos from breaking out via carefully tracking flows of money and information, and making sure that media misinformation is intelligently enough placed to keep the population’s mind filled with compliance-inducing narratives.      See also: Ben Goertzel - AI for Everyone: Super-Smart Systems That Reward Data Creators      But it’s also quite thinkable the size of the elite group of humans controlling the automated means of production fairly rapidly shrinks to zero. Corporate and military leaders will always prefer AI systems that combine creative and ambitious general intelligence with obedience and lack of initiative – but this combination may prove as elusive in AGIs as in humans.      There is a scenario where blockchain technology plays an extremely critical role in the future economy by serving as part of the underpinning of the AGI minds that are humanity’s successors. No doubt future AGIs will come up with algorithms and structures far more sophisticated than anything we can imagine today, but there will likely be a strong ongoing role for the core principles of mathematically guaranteed security coupled with decentralized consensus in distributed systems.      The role of blockchain may indeed be much stronger if the future turns out human-free. The minds replacing humans will probably be secure digital decentralized systems with blockchains integrated into their core code.    Decentralized digital democracy    While dark potentials inarguably lurk on the horizon, more beneficial outcomes also remain firmly within reach. It may well happen that the breakthroughs to human-level and superhuman AGI occur in the domain of open-source hackers and decentralized networks rather than corporate or government labs.      This is what SingularityNET, Ocean Protocol and the dozens of other projects in the Decentralized AI Alliance are working toward. There are major challenges, both on the technology side and regarding regulatory issues and market-dynamics, but nothing that can’t be surmounted with a lot of will, brilliance and a bit of luck.      See also: Cisco, SingularityNET to Decentralize Artificial Intelligence via Blockchain      It is eminently possible to foresee a world in which AGI emerges from decentralized networks controlled by diverse parties, in which various forms of human and cyborg AI interconnect flexibly with various forms of digital and quantum AGI. Perhaps the overall network is controlled and regulated in a heterarchical and open-ended manner rather than controlled by a small number of elite humans or elite computational processes.      In such a world, multiple sorts of value will be respected, quantified with a variety of smart contracts going far beyond the money-like tokens dominating the blockchain world today. The rich aesthetic, social, spiritual and imaginative value of humans, other animals, plants and new forms of self-organizing living systems will be supported and woven together with advanced digital and quantum technologies, without pressure to reduce the value of an entity to the degree of its participation in efficient processes of material production.      Looking closely at the relation between the future of blockchain and the future of humanity, one becomes convinced that the former is much more firmly assured. Yet I remain highly optimistic: There seems a very palpable possibility that we can navigate through the challenges ahead and craft a democratic decentralized future, leveraging the best of humanity and the best of our advanced technologies including blockchain and AI.      Every one of us, as we live and act in the world, is helping to birth the future — to bias and guide the self-organizing processes via which today’s world morphs into the radically different society we’ll see tomorrow. Those of us who are writing the code underlying today’s blockchain and AI systems, or supporting the projects writing the code, are not the only ones writing the future, but we are definitely a substantial part of the mix.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | AGX,Ben Goertzel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/09/17/say-hello-to-the-singularity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2350419e42f657c4f2f2b4dc60f1088c57825009-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432692,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0pjh,1600348101,First Mover: Federal Reserve Does What It Wants to Do as Bitcoin Hits $11K,"Every time the Federal Reserve meets, it's important to remember the only real monetary policy tradition at the 107-year-old institution is that a bunch of people will get together and talk about markets and the economy and decide what to do next.      There's never really any right or wrong answer for how to go about it; there's only the decisions the top Fed officials end up making. The officials are broadly guided, of course, by economic theory and history, ostensibly a desire to provide stability and long-term growth, and perhaps a bit of politics from time to time. But the ad hoc-ness of it all is underscored by the reality that the officials are constantly changing their own rules.      In terms of the market reaction, this week's Fed meeting was as ho-hum as they come. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks slipped 0.5% on Wednesday as the central bank announced its latest incarnation of monetary policy. Gold was little changed. Bitcoin gained 2.2%.      That's partly because Chair Jerome Powell had used a speech last month to telegraph his plans for a newly hatched technique known as ""average inflation targeting."" Essentially, the Fed is now promising to keep U.S. interest rates close to zero until inflation climbs above a 2% target and stays there ""for some time."" On Wednesday, the only real news was the officials formalized the practice.      Average inflation targeting hasn't really ever been tried before, but Fed officials are now mostly in agreement it is the right thing to do at this point in time. The message they are sending is that investors, businesspeople and banks can count on the central bank to keep borrowing costs low until the economy heals.      ""This could all go wrong under some future circumstances, at which point 'Trust us, we’re the Fed' might not be enough for the markets,"" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at the forecasting firm Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note to clients.      Just like the $1.2 trillion of Fed emergency-lending programs rolled out during the 2008 financial crisis, average inflation targeting is a brand-new tool that investors until recent times weren't aware that the central bank might ever choose to use. And just like former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke's ""quantitative easing"" programs in the years after the financial crisis, under which tens of billions of Treasury and mortgage bonds were purchased every month, the new policy is really just a way of trying to engineer an economic recovery.      ""The creativity of monetary policy will remain high, there's no question,"" says Ben Emons, a former portfolio manager for the bond-fund giant Pimco who now serves as managing director of macro strategy for the analysis firm Medley Global Advisors.      What gets a little ridiculous is any attempt to drill down into the supporting materials provided by the Fed as the premise for the decision. A ""summary of economic projections"" posted online Wednesday shows top officials on average expect inflation to stay below 2% for the next couple years before hitting the mark in 2023. They expect the economy to shrink by 3.7% this year before expanding 4% next year, 3% the following year and 2.5% in 2023.      It's the sort of picture one might expect from a perfectly managed economy.      But, of course, Fed officials have little more of a clue than anyone else what the future holds, even in the near term. One of the most contentious presidential elections in U.S. history looms in November. Racial tensions are on the rise. The course of the pandemic is far from settled. Lawmakers are at odds. The national debt has fast grown to nearly $27 trillion, up about $23 trillion at the start of the year, and there's no realistic expectation that the federal budget will be balanced anytime soon.      The economic outlook, and the trajectory of markets, can change quickly. Unexpected things happen. In late 2019, Fed officials were predicting the economy would grow at an anemic but steady 2% clip in 2020. That didn't happen. Fed officials really have no idea how the economy will fare through 2023, let alone what the next few months might bring.      Markets have been stable recently, if even a little frothy, and there's no reason for the Fed to mount any particularly heroic effort right now to change that dynamic.      ""They're driving through the fog and they cannot see,"" Emons said in a phone interview. ""We're coming a bit out of the fog now, but there's still a lot of fog.""      A plausible scenario is the Fed does as little as possible for the next several months unless markets take a fresh downturn, in which case it's possible the Fed would intervene. When markets convulsed in March, the Fed in a matter of weeks expanded its balance sheet from about $4 trillion to $7 trillion; the increase represented about three-quarters of all the money the central bank had ever previously created. Until it happened, it seemed unthinkable.      On Wednesday, Powell was clear the Fed could act forcefully if needed. He noted the central bank is already buying $120 billion of Treasurys and mortgage bonds a month, which extrapolates to $1.44 trillion a year.      ""I certainly would not say that we're out of ammo, not at all,"" Powell told reporters during a press conference on Wednesday. ""There's still plenty more that we can do.""      The lesson for bitcoin traders or gold traders or bond traders or any other investors trying to gauge the potential for rapid inflation or currency debasement, is that if Fed officials decide to print more money, they can and they will.      – Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin Watch  CoinDesk shows the bitcoin price corrected from a high of just under $11,100 to just under $10,900 in the Asia trading day.  While the fall below such a key psychological hurdle is a blow to the bulls, bitcoin currently shows no signs of falling back to the $10,300-$10,400 range it traded at the start of the week.  The correction in the bitcoin price might be a result of growing doubts over the Fed’s ability to hit the 2% inflation target.  While the prospect of high inflation is generally considered to be good for bitcoin, some market observers have expressed concern over whether the Fed has what it takes to meet its target.  Speaking to the Financial Times, John O’Connell, a portfolio manager at Garda Capital, said the Fed still had much to prove because it hadn’t been able to create inflation consistently for a very long time.  Indeed, the Fed announcement was met with general uneasiness across the market. The S&P 500 slumped 0.46% and the Nasdaq fell a further 1%, while both bond yields and the U.S. dollar strengthened slightly.  Similarly, an announcement from the Bank of Japan to keep rates unchanged this morning led to the Nikkei dropping 0.67% in the Asia trading day.  While there’s a case for bitcoin benefiting in a deflationary market, it would certainly harm the prevailing narrative that the original cryptocurrency’s hard-capped supply makes it a perfect hedge against a runaway money supply.  Bitcoin traded at $10,885 at press time. It may drop further as the Bank of England was also expected to keep rates unchanged later Wednesday.    - Paddy Baker    Token Watch    Uniswap (UNI), SushiSwap (SUSHI), Ether (ETH): DeFi leader Uniswap mints 1 billion ""governance tokens"" to be released over next four years, a week after "" vampire mining"" attack by copycat rival SushiSwap.

A report from intellectual property consultancy KISSPatent Thursday found the Chinese tech conglomerate was ""definitely running the show,"" having already published ten times more blockchain patents than IBM, its nearest rival, so far this year.  Should Alibaba continue at its current pace, the study predicted it would become the biggest patent holder in blockchain by the end of 2020.  KISSPatent said this was part of a broader surge in the number of blockchain-related patents published. The first half of 2020 had more patents than the whole of 2019. In turn, 2019 had triple the number of blockchain patents compared to 2018.  Another key point was that most of the patents were filed by traditional Fortune 500 companies rather than companies that exist wholly within the blockchain space.  That might be down to blockchain's prevailing open-source culture, which is at odds with the practice of patent filing, KISSPatent said.  Indeed, Jack Dorsey's Square last week set up a non-profit group for blockchain companies to pool patents and preserve the industry's open-source spirit.  Just in the past few months, Alibaba has patented a cross-chain system that it claims is better than Cosmos, as well as a blockchain that protects music copyright.

42432677,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0pDh,1600347478,Wyoming Bank Regulator Taps Chainalysis to Boost Crypto Tracing Efforts,"Wyoming’s chief banking regulator has turned to Chainalysis for “beefing up” his division's monitoring capabilities of illicit cryptocurrency activities.      Under a one-year deal disclosed to CoinDesk Thursday, Chainalysis will train senior examiners on crypto tracing practices and grant two monitoring software licenses – plus investigatory support – to the Division of Banking as it eases into its new, crypto-facing compliance duties, according to Commissioner Albert Forkner.      Unveiled just one day after Wyoming awarded its first special purpose depository institution (SPDI) bank charter to Kraken, the novel partnership, among the earliest pair-ups featuring a U.S. banking regulator and a blockchain intelligence firm, illustrates how even America’s fast-moving financial watchdogs are cautiously approaching oversight of an asset class that Forkner said still gives some folks the spooks.      “Just the nature of digital assets and the pseudonymity of them have a lot of people concerned about illicit activity,” Forkner said. “When you introduce a new dynamic like this,” he said, regulators have to ensure the newcomers are playing by the rules.      Those rules are no different than the ones governing traditional American banks: Watch out for signs of money laundering, don’t transact with sanctioned individuals, keep tabs on customer identities and uphold the minutiae of the Bank Secrecy Act. As is for cash, so too for crypto.      But blockchains give Wyoming’s banking regulators a powerful upside that cash cannot match: an immutable, public paper trail built into its code. And while anyone with an internet connection can manually hop between Bitcoin addresses, it's only with visualization and tracing tools (like those sold by Chainalysis) that regulators have long sought to unscramble illicit chains.      Chainalysis is among a handful of tracers supporting governments, companies and regulators with cryptocurrency monitoring software. It has particularly deep ties to federal law enforcement. The New York-based firm has banked millions in contracts with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Agency, Internal Revenue Service and other federal agencies in need of crypto support. (Chainalysis and Forkner declined to state this deal's dollar value).      Read more: Inside Chainalysis’ Multimillion-Dollar Relationship With the US Government      If, say, a bank allows its customers to send crypto to a blacklisted wallet address, then “we’ve got proof of those activities” that Forkner said has held up in court. It will also make working with law enforcement easier, Forkner said.      He hopes it won’t come to that. Once Kraken’s banking business gets rolling in early 2021 and perhaps other SPDIs (and even non crypto-specific banks) start dealing in crypto, too, he said the Division of Banking will start back-tracing transaction blocks to ensure the institutions are self-monitoring effectively.      “We’ll be running our own analysis on that, and verifying that the red flags that we see are the same ones that” the SPDIs see, Forkner said.

42432691,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0phh,1600346512,The $55M Hack That Almost Brought Ethereum Down,"Bloomberg News reporter Mathew Leising's new book, ""Out of the Ether: The Amazing Story of Ethereum and the $55 Million Heist That Almost Destroyed It All"", tells the story of the infamous DAO hack that almost brought down the world's second-largest blockchain.      In June 2016, a here-to-now unknown assailant (or assailants) began syphoning off funds from Ethereum's first decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, a bit of software that functions like a corporation. Weeks earlier the DAO went live, following a $150 million crowd sale.      ""[T]he DAO had a huge part to play in the early history of Ethereum,"" Leising writes. ""It’s not overstating it to say that the DAO made Ethereum."" That's because it was one of the earliest examples that Ethereum's network of computers was resilient enough to support complex applications.      See also: David Siegel – Understanding The DAO Attack      While the attack never broke Ethereum's code – it merely exploited a loophole in The DAO's smart contract – it cast doubt over the viability of a blockchain-based ""world computer."" It was also the beginning of Ethereum's two Ethereums.      Leising, who has been covering the crypto industry for the better half of a decade, had called out sick from work the day a hacker absconded with $55 million in stolen ETH. But he didn't let the story die. Over the past four years he has been reporting out the story told in the book, examining blockchain data, following through on cryptic tips and ultimately tracing a path towards his leading suspect.      In the excerpt below, readers find themselves in eastern Germany along with Christoph Jentzsch, one of The DAO's principle architects, who woke up to realize the project he has spent months building is being robbed ""at the rate of about $8 million an hour.""      A religious family man, Jentzsch takes this extemporaneous moment to reflect on the challenges that faced the DAO's creation – from securities worries that still plague token projects to the critical opinions of the early Ethereum community – before taking action. – Dan Kuhn    Chapter 7    The town of Mittweida in the state of Saxony in Germany escaped being bombed in the Second World War. In the middle of town, old stone streets divide rows of brightly colored buildings. If you leave the town square and walk for about 10 minutes you’ll come to a quiet street with a police station; next door is a mint-green house with brown trim and shutters. On Friday, June 17, 2016, just after 8 a.m., Christoph Jentzsch lay on the beige carpet of the first-floor office inside. He tried to still his breathing, to take deep breaths, to not let the world get away from him. Thieves were inside the DAO, his creation, robbing it at the rate of about $8 million an hour.      One of the first things Christoph felt was relief: finally the DAO saga would come to an end. It had overtaken his life for the past six months.      He’d battled anxiety and depression and exhaustion; he’d neglected his wife and five kids. There had been moments when he froze at the thought of releasing the DAO code, because once it was out in the world it couldn’t be changed. There could be a bug in the software, or maybe terrorists could figure out how to use it to fund an attack he’d be power- less to stop. The pressure made him physically ill several times. He’d puked under the strain. God, please, let this be the end of all that.      But Christoph also felt a strong sense of responsibility. It shook him that he’d messed up so badly and that people were losing money because of it. He believed in the ideas underpinning DAOs. (The language gets a bit confusing here as there were other DAOs around at this point, MakerDAO among them. DAO is a generic term for the structure that smart contracts fit into, but because of its eventual size and high profile, Jentzsch’s DAO became the DAO.)    There were so many fears,” Griff said.“Does this destroy Ethereum? Does this destroy DAOs? What’s going to happen to all this money?    A DAO is what got him into Ethereum in the first place, the moment he realized its potential. Vitalik’s white paper had outlined a vision for how DAOs could democratize corporate structures to replace owners, employees, and investors with users who directly managed the firm’s affairs with smart contracts encoded on the blockchain. That breakthrough is what made Christoph pause his PhD studies and start working for Ethereum in 2015. And then, improbably, he built one: the biggest DAO ever built, in fact, which made it a fat target. After all the security checks, Christoph couldn’t understand why no one had found the right bug in time.      He got up from the floor of the office and went back to his IBM ThinkPad laptop. Christoph knew the cops next door couldn’t help him. No, this was his mess and he’d have to clean it up.      In one sense, if toasters and door locks were allowed to have bank accounts the DAO never would have happened.      See also: Christoph Jentzch – ‘Blessing and a Curse’: The DAO’s Developers on Blockchain in 2016      At least, that financial discrimination against appliances and hardware had stirred Christoph’s imagination when he first encountered Ethereum. Now that the cryptocurrency ether had been created, the question that plagued Christoph’s mind was: How could it best be used? Not as a straight cryptocurrency like bitcoin. Rather, ether seemed perfectly suited to be a form of micropayment for what Christoph likes to call the “economy of things.” Airbnb had become popular around this time, and when Christoph looked at the company thorough his Ethereum lens he saw nothing but a middleman to be eliminated. What if with a smart lock on your front door connected to the Ethereum blockchain, you could rent out your apartment directly to someone else? There would still be a web site like Airbnb’s to let an apartment owner find a renter, but the Ethereum version would differ in one key way: the web site would connect people peer-to-peer and there would be no Airbnb in the middle taking its 30 percent cut of the profits.Where does Airbnb’s business model account for that kind of disruption?      This is exactly the kind of simple but very powerful idea that overtakes Ethereum followers. It made me realize its potential on the day in Brooklyn [N.Y.] that Joe Lubin explained it to me. Put a similar type of lock on your car. How does Hertz feel about that? Look at Uber in this way too: it could be as easy to move in on their ride-sharing market as it was for them to take on the taxi industry.      The promise for Ethereum, in my view, is in large part intertwined with this sort of reimagination of the world wide web. If Vitalik and friends can offer an alternative Internet that is peer-to-peer – where middlemen are shunned, things cost less, and privacy and data security are taken seriously – that’s a killer combo. I would sign up for that. Yet it’s far from assured that they will pull it off. For years now, this doubt about whether Ethereum can really deliver on its promise has been in the background of all my work on it. That’s not to say anything about the thousands of people working on Ethereum as developers, entrepreneurs, and salespeople. They are all doing amazing things. But maybe it’ll turn out to be a neat diversion that captured people’s imagination for many years but ultimately came to nothing. It will have to fight for any gains it makes, that’s for sure.      Airbnb, Hertz, and Uber aren’t going to let Ethereum just roll into town and eliminate their businesses. These are global corporations with billions of dollars backing them. Then there’s the state of the actual technology. Ethereum is a long way from having the scale and robustness needed to support millions of users. Regulatory issues are another hurdle. But although the odds are long, there are plenty of people like Christoph, a theoretical physicist, who are willing to drop everything to work on Ethereum and willing to bet on the payout.      While researching his dissertation, Christoph needed to amass a cluster of computer hard drives to simulate his work on generating very long molecules.What worked better than CPUs, he learned, were graphics processing units, or GPUs, which would be faster and more efficient at crunching the data. He looked into buying a bunch of GPUs and ran straight into Bitcoin, as GPUs were the preferred hardware for Bitcoin miners. Soon he was down the rabbit hole, and then in January 2014 he came across Vitalik’s white paper.      “I was totally blown away,” Christoph said. “Now it made sense. Bitcoin was just a cryptocurrency, but this was a decentralized application platform.” The possibilities of what you could do on Ethereum seemed endless to him.      Christoph has so many kids that he can forget how many he had at a particular point in his life. But in the summer of 2014 he needed to earn some extra money – and it doesn’t matter if he had three or four children at the time. He’d seen a presentation where Ethereum cofounder Gavin Wood talked about the money Ethereum was raising in a crowd sale and that it hoped to open a Berlin office and hire C++ developers. That’s exactly what Christoph knew how to do, and Gavin soon hired him.      He became the lead tester for the blockchain protocol. Ethereum was written using three programming languages: C++, Python, and Go. These are the clients that made the blockchain work. But if they don’t talk to each other so that an action on C++ is interpreted in exactly the same way on the Go client, the whole thing breaks down. The blockchain must be sequential above all, so if there’s a breakdown it causes what’s called a fork. When there’s a fork two strings of blocks are created and it can be hard to know which string is the official transaction record. Christoph made it his job to attack the three clients to try to make them fail: to fork. He worked most closely with Vitalik, Gavin and Jeff Wilcke.      “They were all trying to pass my tests,” Christoph said.      After about 10 months working on Ethereum, Christoph wanted to take it to the next level. He’d been pondering the best use for ether and decided it would be for micropayments to Internet-connected devices. He formed slock.it with his brother Simon and Stephan Tual, who each controlled a third of the company.      At a BitDevs meetup in New York City on June 13, 2015, at the offices of venture capital firm Union Square Ventures, Christoph publicly unveiled the idea for slock.it for the first time. Joe Lubin was there that day. Christoph used his phone to connect to Ethereum and unlock a door handle he’d brought with him. This was so early in the company’s history that they called themselves EtherLock.      Christoph received warm welcomes as he went around introducing people to smart locks. The idea gained a following, and now he had to figure out how to fund its development. He soon realized that his desire to build a DAO could be fulfilled, and he began to figure out how it would work. But he not only had to figure out the mechanics of the smart contract. There were thornier issues, like would the slock.it team be legally responsible for what the DAO enabled?      They had lawyers working on this question in NewYork, Switzerland, and Germany. “They actually said, well, if you are not very attached to the project, you just write the contract and publish it, and you will later on ask to work for this company, it will be legally fine,” Christoph said. This was a mark of how decentralized the goal was here – even the people who would bring the DAO to life imagined that they’d have to ask to work for their own creation. How the heck do you do that? Easy; it’s like any other proposal to the DAO – it gets voted on by DAO token holders. Christoph and the rest of the slock.it team felt comfortable with the idea that DAO token holders would vote to fund their startup, out of courtesy to the creators of the DAO, if nothing else.      Then they had to contend with what a regulator like the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] would think of the DAO. Would a DAO token be deemed a security? If so, they’d need to go through a strict registration process and provide potential investors with all sorts of information about the business plan, risks and other details meant to enhance transparency for investors.      See also: Drew Hinkes – The Law of The DAO      Their lawyers had an answer for this, too. “Even if it is a security, the formation of a company is not something you need to ask the SEC for approval,” Christoph said. “We saw the DAO creation as the formation of a company, but not with 3 founders, with 23,000 founders.”      Let’s fast-forward here for a moment and ask an interesting question. According to slock.it’s lawyers, the token sale wouldn’t be considered a security offering in part because the DAO had thousands of founders. What does that say about what Ethereum did with its ether crowdsale? Remember,these are distinct events. The Ethereum cofounders – including Gavin Wood, Vitalik, and Mihai Alisie – sold ether to the public in mid- 2014 to raise money to fund development of the Ethereum blockchain. A discrete, small group of people earned a lot of money through the Ethereum token sale. Doesn’t that imply that ether is a security? The ether sale raised $18 million; cofounders such as Joe Lubin and Anthony Di Iorio were adamant that ether was not a security, but really all they had to back that up was their own opinions and the legal opinion from a lawyer in a situation that hadn’t been vetted by a government agency like the SEC. Then the DAO comes along and slock.it’s lawyers say that if its executives are not attached to the project and everyone who buys DAO tokens is considered a founder, boom! You’re not a security. See the inconsistency? Under this logic, either a DAO token or ether is a security, but both of them can’t escape the designation.      On the U.S. front, at least, the reality is that in 2014–2015 the SEC was asleep at the switch. No one in the government was paying attention to what was going on with the nascent ICO market. The SEC wouldn’t start bringing enforcement cases until years later, and it didn’t get around to writing its opinion on the DAO until a year after it blew up. We’ll get to this a bit later in the story.      Now, back to the DAO. The people who bought DAO tokens never gave their money to Christoph or anyone at slock.it. They were in control of it the whole time and only interacted with a smart contract that exchanged their ether for DAO tokens. They could get their ether back if they wanted to.    It’s not overstating it to say that the DAO made Ethereum.    The brightest minds in Ethereum at the time also gathered to act as a sort of fail-safe mechanism to prevent an attack against the DAO. Known as curators, group members included Vitalik, Vlad Zamfir, Alex Van de Sande, Gavin Wood, Taylor Gerring, Aeron Buchanan, and others. The group was meant to signal that the smartest people in the room had looked at the DAO and implied a type of seal of approval. The curators were exposed as nothing more than window dressing, however, after a number of security flaws were found in the DOA code.      After presenting the idea of the DAO at DevCon 1 in London in November of 2015, excitement only grew around the project. The DAO public slack channel soon boasted 5,000 members. Christoph thought if each of them bought $1,000 worth of DAO tokens they’d be dealing with $5 million. That seemed manageable.      But as the months came and went, a new concern began to gnaw at Christoph. Now that he was into the guts of writing the DAO code, he couldn’t escape its fundamental nature. Once released into the world, it was unstoppable. That was a hell of a lot of pressure to handle when the code you are writing in has only been in existence for a few months and bugs are being found in it on a seemingly constant basis.      In March of 2016, slock.it paid $10,000 for a security audit of the DAO code to the Seattle firm Deja vu Security. The company specializes in examining and testing software meant to power the IoT. Christoph went to Seattle for a week to work with the Deja vu Security team.      “I was staying in an Airbnb and feeling almost sick, like do I really want to do this? I was really nervous, what did I get into here?” Christoph said.There was still time to say no, he thought.      See also: The DAO Attacked: Code Issue Leads to $60 Million Ether Theft      But Christoph couldn’t quit, not on his partners, not on his brother Simon, the CEO of slock.it. They’d maxed out their credit cards, the bank account was empty. They paid Deja vu Security out of their pockets, and Christoph knew he couldn’t keep asking for one more month for testing. Then there was the wider community, who were watching every development.      It’s important to note here that the DAO had a huge part to play in the early history of Ethereum. It’s not overstating it to say that the DAO made Ethereum. There were smaller projects here and there but nothing with the scope and ambition of what the DAO wanted to do. You can see its influence on the price of ether. As 2016 began, the only things the Ethereum community had to look forward to in terms of progress were new versions of the base layer software being released. Put another way, there wasn’t much of a catalyst for the digital currency ether to go up in value. And while work on the underlying Ethereum network was important, no one would use a network that doesn’t have applications on top of it. This is why the DAO was vital.      As the months went by in 2016, ether’s price began to rise. Aside from the network upgrades I mentioned, I can’t find any other reason than the imminent deployment of the DAO for the gain in ether value. By mid-March it traded at $15. The demand to become part of the DAO was the fuel. You first had to buy ether to then buy DAO tokens, so it’s easy to see that thousands of people were converting Bitcoin to ether to then buy DAO tokens, sending the price of ether to a record high.      Everyone was in on it. There wasn’t anything else to do with ether at the time, to be honest. That’s a big reason the DAO grew to $150 million in pure ether purchases.      Soon Christoph didn’t feel like himself anymore. The stress was winning. This wasn’t like him; he came from a large, stable family. The Jentzsch clan had lived in the Mittweida area since the 1500s. His parents have 36 grandchildren. Christoph also had a strong connection to his Mormon faith. His grandfather had brought the religion to Mittweida when he’d started the first Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the small town. Christoph’s wife was another calming influence on him and had supported him through the DAO roller coaster. And still he felt he was getting sucked into the chaos: he went up and down in depressive fits. Like the DAO code, it seemed unstoppable once deployed.      Griff Green was in Mittweida on the day of the attack. He woke in the spare bedroom of Christoph’s mom’s house to his smart phone blowing up with messages that the DAO was being hacked. He called Simon and Simon called Christoph.      Griff hadn’t seen Christoph is such bad shape before. Before becoming slock.it’s first employee, Griff had done Thai massage in Beverly Hills. “I didn’t have a license to do it, because you know I’m not the kind of guy to get a license,” he said. “There was this very intense moment that day when [Christoph] was like, ‘I don’t know what to do.’ He wasn’t crying, but he looked like he was on the verge and he just had to lay down. He was having kind of a panic attack.” Griff went to work on his boss and friend, giving him a massage to help calm him down.“Germans aren’t the most touchy-feely guys,” Green said.      “There were so many fears,” Griff said.“Does this destroy Ethereum? Does this destroy DAOs? What’s going to happen to all this money?”      Not a cent in the DAO belonged to Jentzsch. This was other people’s money, and for a religious, family-oriented man, a good man, that made the theft all the more troubling.      “Dealing with other people’s money fucking sucks, you know?” Griff said.      As the May 28 DAO fundraising deadline had approached, the amount of ether in the DAO just kept going up. No one could ignore the magnitude of what the DAO was becoming right in front of their eyes. The $5 million Christoph expected became a drop in the bucket and he began to freak out.      See also: Nolan Bauerle – The DAO is a New Dow      “I was really not a good husband or father at this time,” Christoph said. He lay in bed that Friday morning when the phone rang. His wife answered and then told Christoph that his brother had said something was wrong with the DAO and he needed to log on right away. In his home office Christoph checked Etherscan, the Ethereum blockchain block explorer (kind of like Google for a blockchain). He saw money leaving the DAO through the split function, which existed in case a DAO user wanted to get their money back and leave.      “In the beginning I thought, well, it’s just someone leaving the DAO,” he said. “But then it’s very weird, it’s always the same amount coming out all the time. And it was one transaction, so one transaction and many payouts. But it should be only one payout per transaction.”      Something was very wrong. He lay on the floor of his office then, trying to keep the world from slipping away. Yet he felt a mix of emotions. “There were two kinds of feelings in me,” Christoph said. “One feeling was – I felt released – because this was clearly the end of the DAO."" This insane, amazing, stressful chapter in his life would finally be over. His responsibility would cease.      “On the other side, there was shock and a feeling of, I basically messed up the whole system. I need to fix this now,” he said. “I need to find out what’s going on, people are losing money. I could go to jail. This kind of fear.”      He got up off the floor and started to fight back.

One such trader, who asked to go only by Joe, is a math student at a Canadian university. Just by playing with Ethereum software and his own calculations, he managed to make hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2020. This wasn’t his first rodeo, however; he’s been trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for more than a year.      “I’m not a whale in the crypto world but I’m one of the top users of the DeFi protocol I use,” he said. “Before, when DeFi was smaller, there was a lot less competition.”      Since Weird DeFi’s food craze began, Joe said “high yields” are now available to newcomers “without a lot of technical knowledge.”      It’s impossible to say just how many rookie traders raked in unusually high profits during the YAM debacle in August, when an unaudited crypto experiment garnered $465 million in crypto then imploded within 72 hours.      Read more: Yearn, YAM and the Rise of Crypto’s ‘Weird DeFi’ Moment      One such anonymous YAM user, who said he rarely trades on exchanges, said he found the YAM trading game fun and relatively easy. He participated in the community vote to “save” YAM, then said he promptly “dumped” his tokens when he realized the software experiment was not sustainable. All things considered, he said he earned $15,000 from participating in YAM, having spent up to $800 on transaction fees.      For both of the above-mentioned DeFi fans, this is a life-changing amount of money. These users often rely on service providers to access the DeFi ecosystem. As such, traders weren’t the only winners of the Yam gambling game. Companies that run the Ethereum network also accrued traffic and transaction fees during the rise of Yam and Sushi, CREAM and now Pickle.      “I access farming and do most one-time things with MetaMask,” Joe said. “The only other [service] I use is the Web3 provider Infura.”    DeFi infrastructure    The DeFi mentality emphasizes open-source access to tools, services with low barriers to entry and distributed teams. Sometimes, this includes low barriers to entry for high-risk games.      According to Uniswap founder Hayden Adams in June 2020, most of the Uniswap ecosystem relies on ConsenSys infrastructure services, like Infura. This has also proven to be the common pattern for copycat DeFi projects like SushiSwap. ConsenSys spokesperson James Beck said the Ethereum conglomerate restructured to make infrastructure and wallet services, like Infura and the DeFi-friendly wallet MetaMask, pillars of the company’s “core software business.”      ConsenSys’s head of product for Infura, Michael Godsey, said his team handled the “increased usage” from the food-themed yield farming spike, watching closely to understand “these new usage patterns.” Such DeFi experiments provide inspiration and research data for Ethereum startups, not chagrin.      Read more: SushiSwap Migration Ushers in Era of ‘Protocol Politicians’      In reference to the DEX tools people use to access these trading games, Godsey added, “Uniswap and MetaMask are two of our amazing customers and many yield farmers are utilizing their platform to participate in this new activity.”      As for Joe, the Canadian college student, he said he plans to keep stacking tokens because the broader DeFi movement is “sustainable and has been growing at a relatively slow pace for years.”      On the other hand, he said the trends over the past few months were heavily influenced by Compound’s token model. Joe reasoned these DeFi experiments might end in a “big crash” or slow fizzle.      “As long as risk-adjusted yield is higher than for other opportunities, I will keep using them,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | UNI,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/17/how-normies-are-getting-crypto-rich-with-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c5b4c029cbdf31208cef7d6d532cfd2f41d8c03f-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42432687,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0pdh,1600344852,Bitcoin Falls Back Below $11K as Markets Doubt Fed's Ability to Boost Inflation,"Prevailing doubts over whether the Federal Reserve has what it takes to hit its 2% inflation target hit traditional markets and may have contributed to a bitcoin price drop early on Thursday.    CoinDesk data shows bitcoin's price fell to just under $10,900 in the Asian trading hours – not long after it had climbed to near $11,100.  The drop is bitcoin's latest failure around the key psychological hurdle and could be the result of prevailing doubts over the Fed's ability to hit the 2% inflation target.  At the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting Wednesday, Fed Chair Jay Powell said the U.S. central bank would keep interest rates at zero until 2023, when the Fed expects to hit its 2% inflation target.  It follows Powell's announcement last month that the Fed would tolerate inflation above the 2% target to compensate for the drop in consumer prices earlier in the year.  The prospect of high inflation is generally considered good for bitcoin and the price instantly ticked up above the $11,000 mark following the FOMC announcement.  But some market observers are now concerned whether the Fed has what it takes to reach 2% inflation.  Speaking to the Financial Times, John O'Connell, a portfolio manager at Garda Capital, said the Fed hadn't been able to create inflation consistently for a very long time and still had much to prove.  Indeed, the Fed announcement was met with general uneasiness across the market. The S&P 500 slumped 0.46% and the Nasdaq fell a further 1%, while both bond yields and the U.S. dollar strengthened slightly.  Similarly, an announcement from the Bank of Japan to keep rates unchanged this morning led to the Nikkei dropping 0.67% in the Asia trading day.  The Bank of England has also just announced it will keep rates unchanged at 0.1%.  While there's a case for bitcoin benefiting in a deflationary environment, it nonetheless goes against the prevailing narrative that the original cryptocurrency's fixed supply makes it an ideal hedge against the deleterious effects of a runaway money supply.

According to a press release Thursday, ParaSwap raised the seed funding from a total of 32 investors including Blockchain Capital, Alameda Research, Arrington XRP Capital, Coinfund, CoinGecko, Aave founder Stani Kulechov and others.  While ParaSwap was started as a DEX aggregator, Benchemled said the firm shifted focus in late 2019 to fine-tuning its API and making the platform an easy-to-use entry point for DeFi applications, traders and wallets.  “Our next steps are growing the team and scaling ParaSwap’s infrastructure so that we can support our next business challenges,” he said in the release.

The Geneva-based organization announced Thursday that former HSBC executive James Emmett will take on the role of managing director of Libra Networks LLC, the operating company subsidiary of the Libra Association.  Taking up his new position on Oct. 1, Emmett will ""help make Libra's vision a reality,"" said the association's CEO, Stuart Levey.  Emmett brings 25 years of experience at HSBC, where has was previously CEO of HSBC Bank PLC and Europe.  Before that he was chief operating officer at the bank, where he guided technology and operations.  Talking of his new role, Emmett said: "" I am delighted to be joining Libra Networks with a mission to enhance financial innovation and inclusion and to deliver the operationalization of the network.”  The Libra project is forging on with its plans, despite having had strident pushback from regulators and politicians over its potential affects on financial stability and monetary sovereignty.  In effect, some fear that a digital payments system pushed over Facebook's network of billions of global users could lessen the influence of fiat currencies and the powers that control them.  Libra was said to have abandoned plans for its stablecoin to be backed by a basket of major fiat currencies, though that was disputed by its policy director in July.  To help smooth its path with the world's watchdogs, Libra has been hiring legal experts with connections to government such as the former general counsel of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and a former aide to a U.S. senator.

Coinbase announced Thursday morning it would begin accepting UNI deposits immediately, with trading beginning as soon as there's sufficient liquidity.  UNI will be tradable against the U.S. dollar in all Coinbase's covered jurisdictions except New York.  Coinbase has not yet said whether UNI will be made available on its retail-orientated platform.  Launched in 2018, Uniswap is one of the pioneers of a new type of trading platform that uses smart contract-based liquidity pools to spot prices and facilitate trades, also known as ""swaps.""  Called an automated market maker (AMM) protocol, users become liquidity providers on Uniswap by depositing digital assets into the pools, receiving interest and a cut of transaction fees in return.  Coinbase, on the other hand, uses the more traditional order book format – where a user's trade is matched up against a list, or book, of buys and sells, and executed at the best available price.  Uniswap announced late Wednesday it would issue a billion UNI tokens to founders, team members and the community over the next four years.  Per the company's release, the token will be used to power on-chain governance decisions.  A governance token that gives users a role in running the protocol might be a move to prevent a flow of tokens and liquidity going to rival SushiSwap.  Approximately $830 million worth of crypto moved over to SushiSwap last week.  Of the two AMM exchanges, SushiSwap is generally considered to be more decentralized.

The amended guidance now includes clarity on token issuances and recommendations for risk management.    The GFSC has made considerable updates to seven out of the nine guiding principles on which the regulatory framework, launched in 2018, was set up.  According to the announcement, the changes reflect the “natural evolution of the defined regulatory principles” to include new developments in the space.  The updates include a risk framework to distinguish between virtual assets and virtual asset denominated instruments that are arguably higher risk, the announcement said.  The guidance on tokens specifies that following a public token offering, DLT providers will not be allowed to use reserves of internally generated tokens as part of its regulatory capital requirement, and includes a section detailing risks associated with stablecoins.  The new updates are part of an ongoing effort to adapt its regulatory framework to include the latest Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations for virtual asset service providers.  The European Union has criticized Gibraltar’s efforts to stem money laundering in the past, mentioning its DLT rules in the process.  Currently, 13 DLT providers are licensed under the Gibraltar regulator, including international platforms eToro, Xapo and Bitso.

The decentralized trading platform announced around 00:30 UTC time Thursday it launched its governance token, dubbed UNI, with 1 billion coins that will be released over the next four years.      While the liquidity mining for the governance token will not start until Friday, Uniswap said historical users and liquidity providers on the platform are now able to claim for 400 UNI per each address.      ""15% of UNI [150,000,000 UNI] can immediately be claimed by historical liquidity providers, users, and SOCKS redeemers/holders based on a snapshot ending Sept. 1, 2020, at 12:00 am UTC,"" Uniswap said in a blog post.      Following the announcement, the number of pending transactions on the Ethereum network per minute has jumped from around 160,000 to over 210,000 as of writing, according to data on blockchain explorer Etherscan.      Within three hours after the claim started, over 18,000 transactions were sent to the smart contract address of the UNI governance token, with more than 5,000 of them pending at the time. The total number of transactions has now reached over 26,000 while the pending ones have dropped to around 3,700 as of writing.      The increasing number of transactions sent to the UNI smart contract appears to have led to a surge of the gas fee on the Ethereum network, which Uniswap's protocol is built on.

42432678,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0pHh,1600307100,China's BSN to 'Localize' 24 Public Blockchains by Making Them Permissioned,"China’s state-sanctioned blockchain infrastructure project is finally bringing public chains to its Chinese users – but with a significant twist.      The Blockchain-Based Service Network (BSN), a standardized internet services provider for decentralized applications (dapp) developers, plans to make 24 public chains available in its network for Chinese users starting from the second half of November, according to an internal memo obtained by CoinDesk.      Developers can use the technical frameworks behind these public chains to build and run dapps that serve a range of purposes such as financing platforms for small and medium enterprises, source tracking for food companies and record-keeping for banks, law firms or government agencies.      These public chains will look quite different after being “localized” for the Chinese market, however. The network will make the decentralized public chains permissioned and replace their tokens with direct payment by the Chinese currency renminbi to cover transaction fees on these chains.      This is part of a much larger story. The Chinese government is an active supporter of blockchain technology – but only on its own terms. Authorities would like to reap the benefits of blockchain tech’s traceability and efficiency, but without the decentralization embraced by public chains like Bitcoin and Ethereum.      BSN’s latest move came one month after the network integrated six major public chains into the global version of its network. This was so that developers outside China could use a standardized development environment to build and run decentralized applications on these public chains. Unlike in the localized version, public decentralized chains are allowed in the global version of BSN.      “There have been few effective ways for public chains to enter the Chinese market and scale up due to legal and regulatory requirements and how these projects position themselves,” the memo, translated by Coindesk from the original Chinese, said of this latest development.      “The public decentralized chains will become public permissioned consortium chains, which can be supervised by regulators, and that is currently the most direct and effective way for the projects to be compliant and reach domestic users within China.”      Read more: China Aims to Be the World’s Dominant Blockchain Power – With Help From Google, Amazon and Microsoft      These new permissioned chains will look very different from the original versions. To make public decentralized chains, such as Ethereum, permissioned, BSN will only allow its designated operators to build and operate nodes, where dapps verify on-chain transactions and store data. The network will block all peer-to-peer fee transactions and require its users to use renminbi instead of Ethereum “gas” to cover fees for building and running dapps on chain.      “BSN has made it technically impossible to do any virtual currency transactions on the public chains,” the memo said. “BSN strictly follows related laws and regulations and will remove any chain that violates them from the network.”      BSN aims to complete all 24 public chains’ integration with the domestic version of the network during the first quarter of 2021 and enable these chains to share data with each other in the first half of the same year.      The networkhas formed Public Permissioned Blockchain, a consortium to govern the services on adapted public chains. Huobi Group, as the only named member of the consortium in the memo, will be in charge of transaction settlement and clearing, marketing for the new services and operating the official portal.      An unnamed cloud services provider will offer the adapted public chains data storage and other basic internet resources. One of BSN’s backers is Chinese tech conglomerate China Mobile, which has an extensive network of data centers across the country. BSN has also worked with the Chinese branch of Amazon Web Service to provide Internet services for dapps.      BSN is backed by the State Information Center of China, a think tank under the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the highest economic planning agency. BSN will be responsible for compliance with Chinese regulators and adapting the public chains’ technical framework into the network.      While the memo does not disclose any names of these 24 public chains, BSN has already integrated major international projects including Tezos, Ethereum and Cosmos’ IrisNet.      “The 24 public chains are highly reputable in the global blockchain community, however, we will not use their original names when they go live on BSN,” the memo said. The chains will be renamed based on 24 Chinese solar terms, a traditional agricultural calendar that informs farmers of seasonal changes.      For example, one of the 24 solar terms is First Frost, which indicates the weather is getting colder and water droplets are starting to freeze. Insect Awakening means it is getting warmer and insects that hibernate underground are about to wake up and go outside.    The forbidden fruit    Public decentralized blockchains have been under heavy scrutiny from the Chinese government since 2017, when China cracked down on initial coin offerings and local exchanges. ICO projects were hard to supervise because of their decentralized nature, and authorities feared that wild token speculation could undermine China’s financial stability.      The tokens from public chain projects are a threat to China’s long-standing capital control and monetary sovereignty of the Chinese currency.      For example, tether, an Ethereum-based token pegged to the U.S. dollar, has become one of the most popular ways for cross-border transactions between Asia and the rest of the world. Authorities may also fear tokens could threaten the use of the renminbi and that would jeopardize monetary policies relying on the control of supply and demand of the Chinese currency.

Another reason why China is critical of public decentralized chain projects is the potential for scams, such as Ponzi and pump-and-dump schemes offered as initial coin offerings (ICO) that mushroomed during and after the 2017 ICO boom. In September 2017, the Chinese central bank made any centralized ICO fundraising illegal.      The People’s Bank of China also carried out a slew of crackdowns on centralized crypto exchanges and fiat-crypto trading, and prohibited any Chinese bank from processing crypto-related transactions.    Inspired by AntChain    AntChain, a permissioned enterprise blockchain developed by Ant Financial, a subsidiary of Chinese tech giant Alibaba, has been one of the inspirations for BSN to launch the Public Permissioned Blockchain consortium, according to the memo.      “It was a milestone when the company launched Ant Blockchain Open Alliance, a consortium that governs its blockchain-based platform lowering the cost for small and medium enterprises to use blockchain technology,” the memo said. “Technically speaking, it is a public permissioned chain with a few authorized nodes.”      Read more: China’s Blockchain Infrastructure Launches Website for Global Devs      One of the main missions for Ant Financial is to provide small and medium enterprises with a more accessible financing platform based on its public permissioned blockchain technology. The company could also leverage the large client base of Alibaba’s other subsidiaries, such as Ali Cloud for internet and data services and the digital payment company Ant Financial for any financial transactions in its app.      Ant Financial claims its users had been uploading an average of $100 million in digital assets, including copyright and property ownership certificates as well as transaction records, to its blockchain in July. Chinese shipping giant Cosco said it was trialing AntChain for tamper-free documentation including container records and import licenses.      The company aims to go public on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges at a valuation of $200 billion.

42432685,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO0pVh,1600303593,Uniswap Launches Governance Token in Bid to Keep Up With Rival AMM SushiSwap,"Decentralized trading platform Uniswap has launched a governance token, UNI, minting 1 billion coins to be released to the public over the next four years.    Announced Wednesday night, the new token will be allocated to Uniswap community members (60% of all tokens), team members/future employees (21.51%), investors (17.8%) and advisers (0.69%).  “UNI officially enshrines Uniswap as publicly-owned and self-sustainable infrastructure while continuing to carefully protect its indestructible and autonomous qualities,” the firm wrote.  The move comes just a week after Uniswap competitor SushiSwap migrated over $800 million in crypto assets from its rival. Of the two automated market makers (AMMs), the newer SushiSwap had been cast as the more “decentralized” of the pair.  SushiSwap launched with a token to enable liquidity mining, and incentivized users to load up on assets prior to the migration to maximize their potential rewards when SushiSwap went fully live.  Uniswap will launch a liquidity mining program on Sept. 18, targeting its USDT, USDC, DAI and wBTC pools.  While the blog post said Uniswap “team members will not participate directly in governance for the foreseeable future,” it noted that team members could delegate votes to protocol delegates, and all UNI holders will have ownership of the governance process. Tokens dedicated to employees, investors and advisors have a four-year vesting schedule.  “A community-managed treasury opens up a world of infinite possibilities,” the blog post said.
