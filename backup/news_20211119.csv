42375838,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwBeKJ,1637356636,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Underperforms Altcoins as Sell-Off Pauses,"Bitcoin held steady around $57,000 on Friday after a near-10% decline over the past week. The cryptocurrency is roughly flat over the past 24 hours, compared with a 5% rise in ether and an 8% rise in Solana’s SOL token over the same period.  “Market sentiment seems short-term bearish/sideways – people are shorting BTC in the perpetual futures market,” Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, wrote in a blog post on Friday.  Analysts pointed to rising leverage as a possible sign of froth in the crypto market, which forced some traders to liquidate long positions earlier this week.  From a technical perspective, bitcoin’s long-term uptrend remains intact so long as support above $53,000 holds.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $57,828, -0.52%  Ether (ETH): $4,272, +5.01%  S&P 500: $4,697, -0.14%  Gold: $1,846, -0.68%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.53%  Off the peak  The chart below shows BTC’s drawdown, or percentage decline from peak to trough. Currently, bitcoin is down about 13% from an all-time high of around $69,000. A slight drawdown is typical after a price reaches an all-time high, although losses can exceed 10%-15% even within a bull market.  Over the long term, bitcoin remains vulnerable to deep corrections along a broader uptrend. Still, drawdowns appear to be limited around 50% to 60% before a price recovery occurs.  Some analysts view the current drawdown as a warning sign of further downside in BTC’s price.  “A drop in total capitalization of another 5% would signal the onset of a bear market, assuming cryptocurrencies live by the same laws of psychology that underpin technical analysis,” Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  “The sell-off in cryptocurrencies from the May peaks ended only after the market lost more than half its valuation. The odds have significantly increased that the bears are aiming to sell the rate down to the $48K level, although there are still a few significant stops along the way,” Kuptsikevich wrote.  Bitcoin holders unmoved  For now, blockchain data shows steady demand for bitcoin. “Even after a near 20% correction of the all-time high, long-term BTC holders do not appear to be spending their coins in panic,” Glassnode, a crypto data firm, tweeted on Friday.  “After peaking at 13.5M BTC, long-term holders have only distributed 100K BTC over the last month, representing just 0.7% of their total holdings,” Glassnode wrote. Still, long-term holders could eventually react to a potential down move in BTC’s price.  Altcoin roundup  Layer 1 tokens outperform ETH: The rise of alternative layer 1 ecosystems have been a key theme this year, with several networks including Terra, Avalanche and Solana seeing a boom in usage as the multi-chain thesis takes shape,” Delphi Digital, a crypto research firm wrote in a Friday note. “LUNA (Terra), AVAX and SOL have performed remarkably well against ETH, especially as the market picked up in the second half of the year, according to Delphi.

42375837,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwBeHn,1637355431,"After Being Foiled by a Billionaire, ConstitutionDAO Faces Lingering Questions","As the dust settles on one of the most ambitious crypto experiments in recent memory, a host of questions remain unanswered – starting with the fate of over $49 million in donations.  On Thursday night, auction house Sotheby’s played host to an unusual bidder: ConstitutionDAO, an ad-hoc group of over 17,000 donors who pitched in to collectively buy a rare print of the Constitution of the United States.  While the bidding ended at $43.2 million – below the $49.5 million the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) raised – the predicted cost associated with insurance, storage, auction fees and transport, among other overhead, prevented the DAO from bidding higher. A DAO is a group of people on the internet using various tools to exercise governance decisions in a variety of areas.  According to a Wall Street Journal report on Friday, billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin was able to outmatch the group.  Read more: ‘I Think We’re Doing This’: Inside One DAO’s $20M Plot to Purchase the US Constitution  Nonetheless, multiple observers hailed the attempt as a remarkable display of DAOs as coordination tools – the entire project was conceived and executed in under a week in a process that insiders referred to as a company in “hyper-growth.”  “This is a group of people that were strangers on Thursday, rallying together with a mission to buy a copy of the Constitution,” said Metaversal CEO Yossi Hasson in an interview with CoinDesk on Friday morning. Hasson was the DAO’s largest contributor at 1,000 ETH ($4.2 million).  Despite the grand ambitions, however, the group fell short and a host of questions remain: Who gets the money raised? What happens to the thwarted governance tokens for the DAO? And, perhaps most importantly, what’s next for what could be the start of a crowdfunding movement?  Who won?  While speculation swirled the night of the auction that another crypto outfit might be responsible for outbidding ConstitutionDAO – maybe even another DAO like Flamingo or Pleasr – it was revealed Friday afternoon that the winner was hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin.  The Citadel founder claimed in February that he “doesn’t know how to think” about cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, and as a result doesn’t think about them at all.  Read more: Citadel CEO Ken Griffin Says He ‘Doesn’t Know How to Think’ About Bitcoin  Later in the year, however – as prices exploded across the industry – he referred to crypto as a “jihadist call” against the U.S. dollar.  The 53-year-old reportedly intends to donate the document to a museum.  PEOPLE in doubt  The DAO raised funds via Juicebox, an Ethereum-based community fundraising tool. In exchange for ETH donations, individuals received PEOPLE, an ERC-20 token that would have granted owners governance powers in the ConstitutionDAO, which would have managed a LLC that actually owned the document.  Some donors appeared to be speculating on the price of PEOPLE appreciating on an auction win, and indeed PEOPLE briefly rallied on decentralized exchanges after donations closed, but the token has since crashed on the news that the DAO lost the auction.  The ETH donors will be able to claim their funds pro rata (minus gas fees) and, per the official Discord, more information about the return will be released today. It is unclear if users will exchange PEOPLE for ETH, or if donating addresses will simply be able to claim the funds they added.  Crypto exchange FTX also reportedly assisted the DAO in converting the donated ETH to cash; it’s unclear if the conversion rate at the time of the auction and the time of the return could impact how much of a refund donors receive.  Gas fees may prove to be a significant barrier to certain donors getting their money back regardless of the return method, however.  The raise was a feat of crowdfunding, featuring over 17,000 donators – many of them new Ethereum addresses – and a median donation of just over $200.  Donating and claiming a refund could eat into well over half of the median donation, and some observers have suggested using a layer 2, or companion, system to ensure smaller donors get a larger cut of their funds back, but details have yet to be released.  A DAO a day  In the wake of ConstitutionDAO’s just-short-of-the-finish-line effort, semi-serious knockoffs and copycats hoping to ape their success currently abound.  Twitter gags have focused on buying a variety of professional basketball teams, amusement park SeaWorld, abandoned shopping malls for the purpose of converting them to paintball arenas, Sotheby’s itself (in order to prevent an injustice like the loss Thursday night from happening again) and a private jet that flies nonstop between New York and Los Angeles.  Members of the DAO itself are mulling their next move as well.  There’s a fledgling movement in social media channels to identify and pursue an alternative piece to purchase in lieu of returning funds, but so far the effort hasn’t grown legs.  While no one project has shown signs of life, it seems unlikely that the trend of flashmob DAOs would simply disappear – Google searches for “DAO” are at a high for the year.  The concept has not enjoyed this much mainstream attention since the failure of The DAO, an early investment experiment whose collapse led to the creation of Ethereum Classic.  The next major DAO push could simply be another auction away.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | ETC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | PEOPLE,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/11/19/after-being-foiled-by-a-billionaire-constitutiondao-faces-lingering-questions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/61709fb308a1c3d105442c7524112fdad805b0e0-5837x3891.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375840,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwBeLZ,1637352806,Bitcoin Attempts Price Recovery After a Derivatives-Led Slide to Sub-$56K,"Bitcoin is looking to regain its footing, having reached five-week lows early Friday in a move market participants said was driven by derivatives.  The top cryptocurrency had recovered to $57,200 at press time from the low of $55,666 reached during the early European trading hours. That was the lowest level since Oct. 13.  The early drop was predominantly driven by traders taking short positions in the perpetual futures market, according to Ki Young Ju, CEO of blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant. “The market sentiment was sell, according to the taker buy-sell ratio,” Ju said. “More people were shorting bitcoin via market orders.”  The taker buy-sell ratio is the ratio of buy volume divided by the sell volume of takers in perpetual swap trades in all derivative exchanges. Individual investors, small firms are referred to as price takers. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton calling cryptocurrencies a destabilizing force at a Bloomberg event may have triggered selling.  Daniel Kukan, senior cryptocurrency trader at Swiss-based Crypto Finance AG, said, “We did not see big sellers at all; the move was derivatives driven.”  Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at Genesis Global Trading, attributed the recent slide from record highs near $69,000 to fears that the finalization of settlement claims against defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox and resolution of the ongoing court battle between Ira Kleiman and Craig Wright for rights to Satoshi Nakamoto’s 1.1 million BTC wallet may bring selling pressure to the market.  Acheson, however, said that these fears are unfounded. “The timing [of the Mt. Gox settlement] is still unclear and could be in 2022 or even 2023. Also, many of the claim holders are hedge funds that may or may not choose to sell,” Acheson said.  Regarding the court battle, Acheson said a win for plaintiff Kleiman is unlikely to lead to the release of a significant portion of the locked coins as feared by some traders. That’s because the defendant has failed to produce evidence of having access to the BTC in question, even should he lose.  Data tracked by Glassnode shows no signs of panic selling by long-term investors. Supply owned by long-term holders has declined by just 26,461 bitcoin since Nov. 10., representing a meager 0.19% of their balance, according to Glassnode data. Bitcoin’s liquid supply has decreased by 145,000 BTC over the past 30 days.  Meanwhile, data shared by IntoTheBlock shows more than 20,000 coins have left centralized exchanges in the past seven days.  “Fears of selling pressure appear to be more of a justification than a reason for the market correction, which has the characteristics of a normal breather to a bull run and a healthy reduction of leverage,” Acheson noted.  The bullish divergence of the hourly chart relative strength index points to downtrend exhaustion and scope for an extended recovery.

NEW YORK — A slapdash alliance of crypto fans was outbid for the U.S. Constitution in dramatic fashion.  The group known as ConstitutionDAO was outbid by an unknown buyer who submitted a $43.17 million bid at Sotheby’s auction house on Thursday evening. When the gavel banged, a first edition copy of the Constitution, one of only 13 in existence, was in new hands.  ConstitutionDAO had captivated mainstream attention as perhaps the best example of a crypto community flexing its real-world buying power.  Read more: ConstitutionDAO Raises $27M on Eve of Sotheby’s Auction. $PEOPLE Could Be the Reason  The DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, or perhaps more accurately, an 18,800-person Discord channel, had crowdfunded over $40 million in under a week from over 17,000 Ethereum wallets.  Ultimately, it was not enough to seal the deal.  DAOs, groups of people on the internet using various tools to exercise governance decisions in a variety of areas, have banded together before to score auction-block wins. But their trophies usually take the form of crypto, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), whose ownership can be governed by smart contracts. A Beeple collection commanded a stunning $69 million at a Christie’s auction in March, supercharging the mainstreaming of NFTs in the U.S. and beyond.  Despite the loss, ConstitutionDAO’s $47 million crowdsourced raise may be a similar signal for online investment collectives. The group suggested it couldn’t top the winning bid of $43.17 million because it didn’t have enough funds for the continued maintenance of the document.  “I think this is a clear harbinger of the beginning for DAOs,” FTX.US President Brett Harrison told CoinDesk. “Up to now there has been many DAOs that have popped up around NFT communities around different kinds of DeFi projects,” but never for real-world assets.  Harrison’s crypto exchange helped ConstitutionDAO convert the crypto to cash held in an account managed by Endaoment, a non-profit that represented the group at auction.  Unlike the auction house’s Bored Ape Yacht Club sale in September, Sotheby’s will not be accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment for the winning bid. Crypto exchange FTX has converted the DAOs ETH into cash for the bid, a deal finalized hours before the winning bid was placed.  DAOmentum  If anything, ConstitutionDAO has fueled a mass of mainstream interest in DAOs in the press.  By Thursday, the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, BBC and other widely recognized brands found themselves explaining the nuances of DAOism. Searches for DAO hit an all-time peak on Google Analytics as the sale neared.  “I think seeing how powerful a DAO can become in a real-world transactions such as this, I think will show people that there’s a lot of potential that people have only dreamed of for these kinds of organizations to be a model for future governance,” said FTX’s Harrison.  The Constitution bidding capped an historic night for crypto at Sotheby’s. Earlier, two works by street artist Banksy captured millions of dollars in ETH in the auction house’s first crypto sales.

The cryptocurrency is holding initial support above $56,000, although resistance around $65,000 could limit further upside over the short term.  The relative strength index (RSI) is oversold on intraday charts, which could encourage brief buying activity. On the daily chart, the RSI is approaching oversold conditions similar to late September, which preceded a price recovery.  On the weekly chart, bitcoin’s long-term uptrend remains intact given the upward sloping 40-week moving average. Momentum is still positive on a weekly basis, which is consistent with a bullish uptrend. And the monthly price chart shows no signs of upside exhaustion yet.  However, the weekly RSI is declining from overbought levels, albeit less extreme relative to January. This means bitcoin is vulnerable to higher volatility as buyers take some profits.

Or is this just a shakeout? Here&apos;s what the SOPR indicator says about it. The Bitcoin SOPR Indicator The BTC Spent Output Profit Ratio (or SOPR in short) is an on-chain indicator that estimates whether investors are selling at a profit or a loss. When the metric&apos;s value is above one, it means coins that were moved during the period were sold, on an average, at a profit. While SOPR values less than one imply the overall market has been selling at a loss during the particular timescale. If the indicator starts trending up, it could mean holders are now realizing their profits and a correction could soon be coming. On the other hand, a downwards trend implies sellers are moving their coins at a loss, and holders with profitable coins may be sitting on to them in hopes of further price appreciation.

42411634,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glPLiR,1637342875,Turkey Makes the Case for Bitcoin as Erdogan Runs the Autocrat’s Inflation Playbook,"Bitcoin trading volumes are rising in Turkey as the increasingly authoritarian government there goes diligently about the work of setting its currency, the lira, on fire.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has retained power since 2003, has to all appearances lost his mind: With inflation sitting at around 20%, Erdogan yesterday lowered Turkey’s key interest rate to 18% from 19% (no, not a typo), instead of raising them to tighten the money supply.  Currency markets have responded decisively to the expected move, with the lira losing 10% of its value against the U.S. dollar since Monday. Some Turkish citizens decided to take their business elsewhere: BTCTurk, one of a handful of local exchanges offering lira/BTC trades, has seen a noticeable uptick in volume, according to public data. That interest comes despite the recent collapse of two other Turkish exchanges, one in an apparent exit scam.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Erdogan’s government banned crypto for payments in April, but owning crypto is legal in Turkey – at least for now. Sadly, the logic of the current situation may push Erdogan to tighten further, as any open lira/BTC trade could put further downward pressure on the lira by enabling capital flight.  Erdogan has reportedly claimed that lowering interest rates – which makes money cheaper and more plentiful – will somehow curb inflation. But his reasoning is opaque. He recently referred to interest as the “devil,” perhaps an oblique appeal to Islamic morality in the face of economic reality.  “It’s just crazy, there’s zero justification for this move as there’s been zero justification for the rate cuts we’ve seen so far this year,” an asset manager told the Wall Street Journal. “Erdogan is running monetary policy on his own.”  It’s not hard to infer Erdogan’s actual motive for (more or less) letting the money printer go brrr: Keeping rates lower is one of only a handful of tools he has for shoring up Turkey’s economy. Turkey has seen short-term hits to its economy thanks to regional instability and COVID-19, which has devastated tourism.  The longer-term picture is even more shocking: Since 2013, Turkey’s GDP has plummeted from more than US$950 billion to $720 billion, partly thanks to instability after a failed coup against Erdogan in 2016. Erdogan’s attempts to ramp things back up have been deeply unorthodox for years, particularly relying on unsustainable levels of debt throughout the economy.

42375839,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwBeJ3,1637341574,Popular DAO Voting Platform Snapshot Labs Raises $4M,"Snapshot, a key piece of tooling for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), has taken a step forward today, raising $4 million to expand operations.  The DAO voting portal announced the funding round on Friday. It was led by investment fund 1kx and included participation from The LAO, MetaCartel Ventures, Gnosis, StarkWare, Coinbase Ventures, BoostVC, Scalar Capital, Fire Eyes DAO, LongHash Ventures and Coopérative Kleros, according to a press release provided to CoinDesk.  The raise is a significant step forward for a project that previously relied on Gitcoin community-funded grants and comes at a time when both the size and responsibility managed by DAOs – including an ever-growing portion of the $250 billion decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem – is constantly ballooning. A DAO is a group of people on the internet using various tools to exercise governance decisions relating to blockchain protocols, pooled investments or any number of other experiments.  Pseudonymous project founder “Fabien” told CoinDesk that Snapshot was initially started as a side project when he was working for automated market maker Balancer. The goal was to create a “simple voting portal,” and Fabien realized his gas-efficient implementation could be used by other projects.  After open-sourcing an early version of Snapshot, it was quickly adopted by early yield farming projects like Yam and Yearn, and has since taken over the governance landscape: among the 2,000 token communities currently using the service are many of the top 10 DeFi protocols, including Aave, Uniswap and Sushi.  The code has been forked multiple times as well – which Fabien encourages – and is increasingly used on the back end for projects with more elaborate interfaces than what Snapshot offers.  Ethereum Name Service (ENS), for example, used Snapshot during its token airdrop, which required users to vote on articles of the project’s founding document before claiming their coins.  Read more: Ethereum Name Service Tokens Soar After $500M+ Airdrop  A portion of the funds raised by Snapshot will be spent on making these types of background integrations easier, including allowing the platform to be included in various DAO development kits like DeepDAO and Boardroom, as well as scaling the project. Fabien said the ENS drop in particular made the team realize it needs to be preparing for “hundreds of thousands of users.”  Given the community-focused nature of the project, Fabien did hint that Snapshot may tokenize with an airdrop of its own in the future, but that it’s not on the immediate horizon.  “We’re interested in making Snapshot community-owned, so a token may happen, but it’s not yet a priority. Our focus is on solving voting,” Fabien said.",POSITIVE,ENS,BAL | BLOCKCHAIN | SPONSORED | ENS | AIRDROP,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/11/19/popular-dao-voting-platform-snapshot-labs-raises-4m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/637da17d13c41a4cce78d59508fa44bce90c51de-5926x3951.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

There have always been concerns around the Bitcoin competitor regarding the absolute privacy that the digital asset confers. Until now, it remains impossible to track/trace Monero transactions, making it the ultimate privacy coin, and governments are worried that individuals will use this to evade taxes. Another concern is around the use of the cryptocurrency as a criminal tool, although there is no definitive way to tell if this is true. However, it remains high enough on the list of concerns that even countries where cryptocurrencies are not illegal are clamping down on the cryptocurrency. The latest is the UK as regulations have pushed Kraken to remove access for its citizens.

42411627,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glPLHz,1637340475,Why Barbados’ Metaverse Embassy Matters,"CoinDesk’s scoop that Barbados had become the first government to acquire virtual land and create a “metaverse embassy” was met with great interest, but a lot of quizzical looks as well.  The question some commentators asked was: What is the point? If Barbados is trying to digitally solve some problem – such as how to make issuing visas and permits more efficient – why use a blockchain when a simple e-government services website would suffice? The metaverse part seemed like a gimmick.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Our own Will Gottsegen, who knows the nooks and crannies of non-fungible tokens and the metaverse far more deeply than I do, concluded a skeptical column on the topic by stating, “Not everything needs to be on the blockchain – in the absence of clarity, the metaverse embassy just feels like an empty ad campaign from a government official with a stake in the crypto industry.” He was referring to Gabriel Abed, Barbados’ ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, who is also the founder of crypto company Bitt and the person who brokered the deal between the government and blockchain-based virtual world platform Decentraland.  To Will’s point on clarity, we definitely need more information on what Barbados plans to do with this project. Still, I think there’s a lot more here than meets the eye. This raises some pretty interesting questions about how sovereignty is exercised in the digital age. And it has the potential to be quite disruptive.  To understand why, we need to go down the rabbit hole of property rights and state power, starting with how it currently works in real life.  Treaties and property rights  When governments set up embassies in foreign lands, international treaties ensure they’re granted certain protections from interference by the host country’s government.  Those treaties hinge upon the control that national governments legitimately exercise over access to their territory, a power that stems from their command of the security forces that police it. The host commits to not arbitrarily exercise that power.  Meanwhile, legally enshrined property rights give foreign governments the freedom to use that space without interference from the state, much like those enjoyed by private homeowners in modern democracies. This combination of treaty protections and the right to own, occupy and use property creates a sufficient degree of sovereignty for an embassy to function.  Read more: A Crypto Guide to the Metaverse – CoinDesk  It’s important to note that both of these rights exist at the whim of the host government. There are plenty of examples of one state deciding not to grant another diplomatic recognition – the U.S. did so with Cuba for decades – because of one geopolitical issue or another that, in its view, outweighed the benefits of reciprocal rights.  The point is that the entire system of international diplomacy starts with the premise that national governments control their territory and hold jurisdiction over the laws governing how individuals and entities can and cannot behave within it. That power affords governments the discretion to decide with which people and entities they and their citizens can transact, interact and forge diplomatic relations.  Now, let’s translate that to NFTs.  How I relate this legal framework to the metaverse stems from my view that non-fungible tokens are the foundational layer for a new model of digital property rights. I believe the systems we build on them will eventually end the power of gatekeeping internet platforms such as Facebook and Google to set the terms for digital asset usage rights.  It’s also based on the idea that an entity’s control over the private key that manages tokens or smart contracts within a blockchain address is analogous to a nation-state controlling access to its land. Whenever an NFT is transferred from a seller to a buyer, the former enables access to it by putting the token and any on-chain-related digital assets under the control of the latter’s private key. (Note: Rights to off-chain assets such as digital or physical art also require a real-world legal contract that’s associated with that NFT, which is analogous to a property deed spelling out an owner’s or occupier’s rights to a piece of real estate.)  Apply this idea to a government using its private key to control access to digital assets in the metaverse, and you now have something that resembles its real-world power over physical land. It’s not the same as a state’s absolute power to wield physical force against an enemy state, but it’s not far from the delegated, dependent powers that a foreign embassy acquires via diplomatic property rights and treaties.  The bottom line is that this functionality will allow Barbados to set the terms by which others – be they people or other foreign governments – use and interact with the digital assets that it puts under the control of its Decentraland address.  A skeptic might argue that this makes the Caribbean nation nothing more than a glorified owner of JPEGs. But that betrays a lack of imagination around how this new model of digital property rights will evolve in the future.  What happens, for example, if another government buys land in Decentraland and then chooses to join some sort of metaverse treaty with Barbados? In doing so, each country will in effect be exercising their real-world sovereign power to mutually recognize each other’s legitimate autonomous control over their private keys within a uniquely defined metaverse space.  This feels like the digital equivalent of the Westphalia Treaty of 1648, which enshrined the nation-state concept. That treaty constituted mutual recognition that each state wielded sovereign power within its respective geographic boundaries. In this case, the mutual recognition revolves around the powers attached to the control over private keys.  What next?  Given that so much of our economic activity now takes place online, there’s an opportunity for nation-states to forge digital age Westphalia treaties and set a host of different reciprocal rights for their respective citizens. It’s certainly cheaper than the multi-million-dollar cost of acquiring and maintaining physical embassies in each other’s real-world territories.  It makes perfect sense that small states like Barbados, along with others embracing crypto innovation – such as Malta, the Bahamas, Bermuda, Cambodia, East Timor, etc. – would seize this opportunity. Amid the uncertainty of COVID, their often commodity- or tourism-dependent economies have become even more vulnerable to the boom-bust cycles of large, western economies like the U.S. Stricter bank compliance rules since the 2008 financial crisis have also seen them suffer at the hands of “derisking.” Now they have a cost-effective way to band together, free of geographic constraints, to encourage digital innovation in their common economic interests.  As to what trailblazing states might do with this new model remains to be seen. Barbados’s initiative may end up having no substantive impact. But given the explosion of innovation unleashed by the emergence of cryptocurrencies, smart contracts and NFTs, it seems quite possible that this will spawn disruptive new ideas for governance and diplomacy.

Metaverses in their previous iterations had in-game currencies and economies, in most cases without real-world value. The innovation of NFT Metaverses consists in having native cryptocurrencies that are used for transactions and to receive in-game rewards, all of which have economic value in the real world.

Blockchain offers distinct value propositions: “displacing trust with truth; real-time bilateral settlements; real-time servicing; enhanced security; automation; the ability to operate 24/7/365,” according to the note that looks at themes that will define the future.  The bank sees asset-backed securities (ABS) markets, including mortgage-backed securities (MBS), as having a high potential for disruption from blockchain. These types of securities pool together assets such as mortgage loans, auto loans, student loans, credit card receivables and equipment leases.  While blockchain is not new, the bank observes, the technology until recently had not developed to a level that was appropriate for banking and financial markets in “terms of scale, speed, flexibility and autonomy.”  But the “technology itself appears to have evolved enough since the Ethereum launch in 2015 to meet the critical demands of at least certain segments in the banking and financial markets.”  One of the most important advancements was the change in the “consensus mechanism” from the energy-intensive proof-of-work to the more energy efficient proof-of-stake mechanism, the note says.  Acceptance of a universe made up of multiple “interoperable blockchain protocols” has also led to the development of more specialized blockchains that bring increased scale and speed, as well as higher flexibility and autonomy.  The “regulatory landscape is very fluid” given the speed of development of blockchain technology and how it does not exactly fit into existing legal and regulatory definitions, the report adds.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/19/blockchain-tech-has-evolved-enough-to-meet-some-demands-of-financial-markets-rbc-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c5abf0d594e9c964200826d27442207fd319b494-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Fraud cases involving China’s central bank digital currency have been making headlines. Just this week, police arrested a woman for defrauding RMB 300,000 ($40,000) using the CBDC. Earlier in November, another 11 people were arrested in Henan province for using the digital yuan to launder money for Cambodian gangs.  The use of CBDC to commit fraud undercuts the narrative that digital currencies issued by nation states will be a better, less-prone-to-fraud alternative to crypto. That this is happening in security-conscious China, which has severely cracked down on crypto is bound to engender a certain about of schadenfreude amongst crypto advocates.  The news could also indicate that China’s CBDC is still not ready for a full rollout as security issues get fixed.  The Xiongan authorities warned not to use unauthorized sources to download e-CNY apps, not to fall for scammers pretending to be government authorities, or invest in “digital yuan exchanges.”  Xiongan district, near Beijing, was one of the first places to pilot the e-CNY.  China is expected to be the world’s first major economy to roll out a CBDC.

DoraHacks provides on-chain toolkits to help developers raise funds for their startups. DoraHacks community members have received over $12 million in grants and donations so far this year, according to the company.  “Since 2018, DoraHacks has partnered with Binance on 15 global hackathons and grant rounds. Through DoraHacks’ developer events and grant toolkits, Binance has distributed over $2 million in funding to more than 100 teams,” said DoraHacks founder Eric Zhang in a press release. “This new round of strategic investment will help us accelerate the innovation of developer incentive mechanisms, deliver more effective products to support hackathon organizers and Web 3 open-source applications and promote Dora Factory’s infrastructure and ecosystem development.”  DoraHacks partner Steve Ngok told CoinDesk the funding would also help recruit more senior management to improve efficiency and accelerate development.  As part of the funding, DoraHacks is co-organizing the recently launched third session of the Binance Labs Incubation Program, an eight-week session providing growth assistance for nine startups.

While crypto fanboys have long hailed bitcoin as a better alternative to the U.S. dollar, traditional market pundits suggest otherwise. “Bitcoin is unlikely to replace the dollar as a global reserve currency,” Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex and author of the book “Making Sense of the Dollar,” told CoinDesk last year. “Backing the dollar is the world’s biggest, deepest and the most transparent government bond market.”  Clinton’s comments come in the wake of controversial crypto tax reporting requirement that was part of the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill signed into law by U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday. Per the bill, from 2023 brokers will need to disclose customers’ names, addresses, phone numbers, capital gains, and losses to the Internal Revenue Service. Entities receiving crypto payments worth more than $10,000 will have to reveal the sender’s identity to the government.

An earlier effort to raise funding was thwarted by investor concerns over its independence from Binance US’s parent company, the New York Times reported. Zhao said the new funding round will “close in about a month or two.” The exchange is raising “a couple hundred million” in the round, Zhao said, although he said he was not clear on the exact number.  An earlier effort to raise funding was thwarted by investor concerns over its independence from Binance U.S.’s parent company, the New York Times reported.  Binance, the global crypto exchange Zhao started in 2017, has also set up an entity for its global headquarters and is currently communicating with regulators around the world, the CEO said. He named France, the UAE, and Singapore as crypto-friendly jurisdictions, but did not say where the actual headquarters was.  Zhao did not rule out an IPO for the Binance global entity, but said it is a much larger company and it would have to look into where it could become a publicly traded firm.  “To be honest, in five, 10 years, we might see crypto exchanges merge with stock exchanges,” which means that Binance.com could list on a crypto exchange.  At the forum in Singapore, Zhao said that the only connection between Binance and Binance US is that he sits on Binance US’s board. He claimed he is not involved in the U.S. exchange’s day-to-day operations and doesn’t have the American unit’s Slack, which the company uses for internal communications, installed on his phone.  He said he has a call with the company’s CEO about once a week, he said. Binance.com provides the product and technology for Binance US, he said.  The exchange is considering lowering fees for users, Zhao said at the event, adding that he believes in maximizing shareholder value in the long term.

42420823,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYl93,1637291350,Kleiman v. Wright: A Story of Physical and Financial Tribulation,"MIAMI – The federal civil trial of Kleiman v. Wright continued in Miami Thursday, with witnesses for the defense suggesting it was unlikely Dave Kleiman had a business partnership with Craig Wright to invent and mine bitcoin. He had severe health problems, poor coding skills and never mentioned any such project to his close friends. When he’d entered into a different business partnership, it had been formalized, they testified.  Wright claims to have invented bitcoin, although that claim has been met with considerable skepticism and has never been successfully proven. The idea for the cryptocurrency was outlined in an October 2008 white paper posted online by someone or someones using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, who stopped posting in 2011.  The federal lawsuit is rooted in the parties’ assumption that Wright is Satoshi – but alleges that he invented and mined bitcoin with the help of Dave Kleiman, who died in 2013. The lawsuit, filed by Kleiman’s brother Ira Kleiman on behalf of Dave’s estate and a company Dave controlled, alleges that the estate is entitled to assets still tied to Satoshi, which include bitcoin that’s now worth about $66 billion and intellectual property.  Read more: Kleiman v. Wright: Bitcoin’s Trial of the Century Kicks Off in Miami  Physical limitations  Dave Kleiman, who’d become a paraplegic after a 1995 motorcycle accident, was in a hospital almost continuously – about 850 days – from Sept. 24, 2010, to March 21, 2013. Infectious disease expert Dr. D. Stewart MacIntyre, Jr. testified that based on his review of medical records, Kleiman suffered from pressure ulcers (bedsores), brittle bones and infections, including MRSA. He took medicines including antibiotics and Valium. He was paralyzed from the waist down and nurses were required to turn him every two hours.  MacIntyre said Kleiman was frequently interrupted by staff and therapists, suggesting that it would be hard to get work done. An IV could have made it hard to move around. To leave the hospital required permission from a doctor, like a furlough. Kleiman asked to leave one day to oversee installation of a mechanical lift in his bathroom, and never returned. Kleiman was found dead in April 2013.  On cross-examination, Dr. MacIntyre was pressed to concede, ”I was not asked to evaluate his brain” nor his mental capacity.  Plaintiffs’ counsel ran through exhibits, seeking to show that Kleiman’s physical limitations wouldn’t have precluded him from working. One mental state exam showed Kleiman receiving a score of 30/30 and noted “no evidence of difficulty understanding multi-step or complex instructions … or complex or abstract information.”  Hospital staff who treated him documented “patient observed on laptop” and “patient always on his computer.” A psychology note said Kleiman worked in computer forensics and “the patient indicated his ability to continue working has helped him cope with his medical problems.”  But in one email dated April 9, 2008, Dave Kleiman told Craig Wright about his medical problems, adding, “I have not worked in about 10 days.”  Kimon Andreou worked with Dave Kleiman at a West Palm Beach company called S-Doc, also called Securit-e-doc, from 2002 to 2004. Andreou testified that Kleiman became one of his closest friends. They would do things like get dinner or attend gun shows together. Andreou said Kleiman had “minimum to no” coding skills.  Andreou would visit Kleiman after work when he was in the hospital. He had “surgery after surgery after surgery,” Andreou said.  Financial difficulties  Evidence in the case includes about 200 pages of text messages between the two men, dated from 2009 to April 18, 2013. Some messages from late 2010 into mid 2011 indicate that Kleiman told Andreou he was behind on mortgage and utility payments. He sent Andreou Lotto numbers so that Andreou could buy him some tickets.  Andreou was questioned by defense attorney Jorge A. Mestre:  “During Dave Kleiman’s lifetime, did he ever tell you that he had formed a business partnership with Dr. Craig Wright to either mine or invent bitcoin?”  “No.”  “Did he ever tell you he had hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoin?”  “No.”  On cross-examination, Andreou was asked about an email he’d written after Dave’s death, which stated, “If all the documents are authentic, then with the addition of the anecdotal information we have from discussions with Dave, all point to Dave and Craig indeed being behind Bitcoin.”  Andreou said that after claims of Kleiman’s involvement with bitcoin hit the news, “it seemed very plausible and I was convinced at that time they were the co-creators of Bitcoin.” But Andreou insisted his thinking at that time was based on third-party information, and ultimately he did not believe Kleiman did coding or programming for Bitcoin, nor was he the hands-on-the-keyboard person behind Bitcoin.  Plaintiffs’ counsel pointed out that after leaving S-doc, Andreou went to work for the Royal Caribbean cruise line, where his boss was the sister of defense attorney Mestre.  Carter Conrad took the stand next, testifying that he knew of Dave Kleiman through a listserv geared to computer forensics. The two met in person at a Miami conference, and Conrad began helping Kleiman with work – at first, mostly physical tasks like unplugging and moving computers so that Dave could examine them. When Dave went into the hospital, Conrad began taking on additional work and eventually suggested they formalize their partnership. A third person, Patrick Paige, joined their business, too.  Other business documentation  The defense team showed documents – such as a profit and loss statement, an operating agreement, and a registration with the state – illustrating their point that the resulting firm, Computer Forensics LLC, was a legitimate entity, its ownership shared evenly among the three men. Kleiman recruited a longtime friend to be their accountant and emailed him particulars such as projected revenues and how they’d split income.  On cross-examination, plaintiffs’ attorney Velvel (Devin) Freedman asked Conrad if Dave was able to write computer scripts. Conrad recalled him using scripts at a conference and said there was “a great likelihood he built them.”  Conrad said he knew of Kleiman’s financial problems and “struggled” to understand why, if Kleiman had assets, he would not have cashed those out to pay for his debts.  Freedman asked, “If bitcoin belonged to a partnership, then it would make sense?” Kleiman was honest and wouldn’t “put his hand in the cookie jar” to take from the partnership, Freedman suggested. Defense counsel objected, and the judge sustained the objection, cutting off that line of questioning.  The last witness of the day was Kleiman’s accountant friend, David Kuharcik, who testified over Zoom that he’d always prepared Kleiman’s federal tax returns. Defense attorney Amanda Marie McGovern displayed some tax documents, seeking to show that Kleiman typically would pass on all information needed to do complete and accurate returns, but did not pass on anything that reflected a legal partnership involving bitcoin.

42375824,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwBe5D,1637284753,Biden and the Fed: Why Powell or Brainard Won’t Change Much for Crypto,"Placing bets on which candidate for Federal Reserve chair would be best for cryptocurrencies? The answer might disappoint: Both incumbent Jerome Powell and leading alternate Fed Governor Lael Brainard are seen as having roughly the same impact.  The speculation of who will be the next Fed chair intensified after Senate Banking Chairman Sherrod Brown said early this week he was told by White House officials to expect a near-term nomination announcement from President Joe Biden. The anticipation got super-charged after Biden said Tuesday that he would make a final decision in about “four days.” That comment focused on the timing on Friday or Saturday.  Brainard is seen as the frontrunner to replace Powell and was one of the few prominent regulators to delve into cryptocurrencies early on.  But some crypto-savvy economists say the differences between the two candidates’ positions – on both digital-asset regulation and economic policy – are so slight and finely nuanced that the choice might not make a huge difference for the industry or cryptocurrency markets.  Both Powell and Brainard are seen as monetary-policy doves – meaning they would likely be more tolerant of inflation, if given a choice – and that might be a positive for bitcoin given the cryptocurrency’s use by many investors as a hedge against rising prices. They also, generally speaking, share a conviction that cryptocurrencies should not be allowed to grow unfettered to the point where they might threaten the existing financial system.  “I don’t think the Fed’s policies toward crypto would be that much different under Brainard than they would be under Powell,” said Ian Katz, managing director of Capital Alpha Partners, a consultancy that advises investors on federal policies. “Both are mainstream Fed institutionalists who would want a strong role for regulators in overseeing crypto and making sure it doesn’t cause financial-stability risks.”  Powell’s policy stances and track record of using generous monetary stimulus to help pull the U.S. economy out of the pandemic-induced economic malaise and market turmoil are well documented. But who is Brainard and more importantly what might her appointment mean for the crypto industry?  Who is Lael Brainard?  Brainard has been serving on the Fed’s Board of Governors since 2014 and previously served as undersecretary of the U.S. Treasury Department. She has master’s and doctoral degrees in economics from Harvard University.  Brainard has been one of the most outspoken Fed officials addressing cryptocurrencies since 2016 and has recently been delving into the possible issuance of a central bank-issued digital currency (CBDC).  “By introducing safe central bank money that is accessible to households and businesses in digital payments systems, a CBDC would reduce counterparty risk and the associated consumer protection and financial stability risks,” Brainard said in a prepared statement during CoinDesk’s Consensus 2021 event in May.  Powell recently said he doesn’t intend to ban cryptocurrencies altogether but said stablecoins need greater regulatory oversight. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is tied to an outside asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold, to stabilize the price.  Digital dollar  A digital dollar – a central bank-issued, tokenized form of the U.S. currency – could help improve financial access for the unbanked and make it easier to disburse government aid, according to some supporters of a the innovation. Some naysayers argue that existing technologies may be better suited for those tasks.  In the global race for countries adopting CBDCs, the U.S. is seen as slightly behind the curve, with a number of countries already experimenting with the concept, and China’s digital yuan already in trials.  “If other major jurisdictions are introducing CBDCs for purposes, not only of domestic payments, but international payments, it’s just very hard for me to imagine that the U.S., given the status of the dollar as a dominant currency in international payments, wouldn’t come to the table,” Brainard said in September during a National Association for Business Economics (NABE) panel discussion on the U.S. economy.  Powell versus Brainard  So would a nomination of Brainard mean a clear path to issue a U.S. dollar-backed CBDC? It’s complicated.  “I think certainly the people who want to see a more active Fed and a more hands-on Fed with regards to any rollout of a central bank digital currency would be backing Brainard, and they are certainly again, within the progressive wing of the Democratic Party,” Garrick Hileman, head of research at Blockchain.com, said in an interview with CoinDesk.  However, the decision might come down to Congress, since the Fed likely won’t be able to decide without legislative input.  “While the Fed would maybe gain a more vocal advocate for CBDC, I still think this is a congressional decision ultimately,” Hileman said. He added that there is a growing resistance in Washington to the idea of a CBDC and he is skeptical if her appointment will change the thinking.  Katz, of Capital Alpha Partners, says Democrats seem to be more skeptical of crypto than Republicans.  Does the U.S. need a CBDC?  Brainard’s path to supporting CBDCs wasn’t linear. Her stance reversed after Facebook’s proposed stablecoin, originally known as libra, and COVID-19 entered the discussions.  In 2017, Brainard said she saw “no compelling demonstrated need for a Fed-issued digital currency.” Then Facebook, since rebranded as Meta, introduced its own digital currency, “libra,” in 2019, which threatened the status quo of central bank-issued cash.  COVID-19′s arrival in early 2020 accelerated the push toward contactless payments, and possibly bolstering the case for cryptocurrencies to become more mainstream.  Brainard was among those who criticized the “libra” project, revealing in February 2020 that the Fed had already begun researching digital payments and determining what issues may exist around them.  “I think it’s vital for us to solicit a broad range of views on what the possible benefits and risks associated with introducing a central bank digital dollar might look like,” Brainard said at the NABE panel.  Is Lael Brainard a dove?  In gauging the implication of the next Fed chair, a key consideration is U.S. inflation, which increased to 6.2% in October, the fastest in three decades.  Inflation has become even a bigger topic for the crypto sector as bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, is increasingly seen as a “digital gold” or a store of value, to hedge against rising prices. Some analysts and economists see Brainard as more dovish than Powell, although many investors might argue it would be hard to run looser monetary policy than the current chair has been overseeing.  “Although we see Governor Brainard as leaning somewhat more dovish than Powell, particularly with respect to emphasizing the new ‘broad based and inclusive’ nature of the Fed’s maximum employment objective, there are a few reasons we do not believe this appointment will have a material impact on the broad policy trajectory,” said Deutsche Bank’s Chief U.S. Economist Matthew Luzzetti wrote in a recent research note.  Luzzetti argued that inflation is expected to remain elevated next year, which would make the Fed “uncomfortable” regardless of who is nominated. Furthermore, regional Fed presidents and board members such as Waller are likely to remain hawkish.  “As such, there would be constraints to how dovish the committee could shift even if the incoming Fed chair wanted to push policy in that direction,” Luzzetti said.  Furthermore, it’s possible that Brainard could turn more hawkish if nominated and confirmed, Blockchain.com’s Hileman said.  “One thing I would highlight is that often people who come into the Fed chair role with a reputation for being ‘more dovish’ will actually turn out to be more hawkish, at least initially, because of the need to establish credibility, their credibility with markets, and with the doubters,” he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/19/biden-and-the-fed-why-powell-or-brainard-wont-change-much-for-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/541367a4cb79b1e5b62cb8dfb49172669ae0a1a3-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As CoinDesk previously reported, the sale is the first time the auction house has denominated a sale in cryptocurrency. The pieces, “Trolley Hunters” and “Love Is In The Air” (2006) were estimated to sell for $5 million-$7 million and $4 million-$6 million respectively, and both largely met expectations with sales worth $6,698,400 and $8,077,200 – a combined 3,093 ETH.  Accepting bids in crypto is part of a larger cryptocurrency-focused push from the auctioneers. In October, Sotheby’s launched “Sotheby’s Metaverse,” a virtual gallery for the live auction event.  Crypto fans are now closely watching an auction scheduled for later in the night: the sale of one of 13 remaining copies of the United States Constitution, which will include bidding from a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).
